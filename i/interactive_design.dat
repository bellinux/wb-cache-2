The Warehouse also houses a contemporary art space that commissions, exhibits, and promotes the work of local and international artists in a variety of media. Hundreds of students and faculty have also been affected by the temporary move of the School of Architecture downtown for the $12million renovation of its campus facility, Slocum Hall.|$|E

This often hurts its placement in rankings with methodologies that place great weight on the test-driven, college level courses.

Courses thus often surpass AP courses in technical rigor and creativity, such as Series Hybrids & Electric Vehicles, Civil Engineering & Architecture, Cybersecurity, Digital Electronics, Optics & Lasers, Arduino Microcontroller, Modern Optical Physics, Advanced Problems in Music Theory & Technology, Comparative Asian Cultures, Microscopy, Forensic Science, Biopsychology, Foundations of Nanotechnology, <b>Interactive</b> <b>Design,</b> Robotics, Stagecraft, Medical Microbiology, BioEngineering, Markets & Trading, Zoology, Acting Methods, Bioethics, Java, Python, Anatomy & Physiology, Organic Chemistry, Macroeconomics & International Economics, Advanced Business Topics, Entrepreneurship, and Culinology.|$|E

The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection of Surrealist art includes the largest public display of Joseph Cornell's works (37 boxes and collages). The Wing also houses contemporary art from after 1960; new photography, video media, architecture and design galleries including original renderings by Frank Lloyd Wright, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Bruce Goff; temporary exhibition space; shops and classrooms; a cafe and a restaurant, Terzo Piano, that overlooks Millennium Park from its terrace.

50|$|Lisa Graham is {{an award-winning}} visual communicator, author and current {{associate}} professor at the University of Texas at Arlington. Her expertise is in Graphic Design and Interactivity. One of her books, Principles of Interactivity, has gained much recognition from the design world. Graham explains in her writing that <b>Interactive</b> <b>Design</b> is a meaningful arrangement of graphics, text, videos, photos, illustrations, sound, animation and 3D imagery. She begins to explain interactivity by giving the reader an example of a simplified version of Interactivity. Her example of simple interactivity is something like an all-text web page with a few links to other webpages navigating to other pages with similar and more in depth information. Her idea of a more complex interactive project is something like a document all or any forms of digital media. In her writing, the <b>Interactive</b> <b>Design</b> Process begins with Problem Definition and follows steps like fact finding, idea finding and project visualization. Graham breaks down successful <b>interactive</b> <b>Design</b> into establishing content, planning, flowcharts, storyboards, creating sample layouts, determining navigation, prototyping, usability testing and mastering. To Graham, understanding the goals of an interactive project is critical {{to the creation of a}} good interactive document. Graham has a very different view and idea of <b>Interactive</b> <b>Design</b> from that of Chris Crawford, who believes good <b>Interactive</b> <b>Design</b> is based on three main ideas: Listening, Thinking and Speaking. Graham has a great understanding of the process for creating <b>Interactive</b> <b>Design</b> whereas Crawford gives us a straightforward understanding of the theory and definition of <b>Interactive</b> <b>Design.</b>|$|E

40|$|Summary As technologically {{mediated}} experiences {{become increasingly}} common {{outside of the}} work context, designing for play, learning and awareness, to name a few, should be guided by creative principles and not necessarily by traditional human-computer interaction (HCI) measures of efficiency and effectiveness that can result as an impediment to experiential <b>interactive</b> <b>designs.</b> An alternative framework for design, ambiguity, as defined by Gaver, Beaver and Benford in their paper, “Ambiguity as a Resource for Design, ” will be applied to <b>interactive</b> <b>designs</b> that support awareness, learning and play. Specifically under investigation are interactive works of art that encourage awareness such as the Projected Realities system and the Influencing Machine; encompassing designs that promote learning, individually and collectively, among children and adolescents such as Full-Contact Poetry and Nimis; and environments that support play such as The Hunting of the Snark and Bystander.

40|$|In {{accordance}} with our design knowledge, the usersi expectations {{and the level}} of the technology reached, show us that <b>interactive</b> media <b>design</b> is not only an interactive environment which depends on two dimensional typographic composition any more.
