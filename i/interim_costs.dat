5000|$|In 2006, McKenna {{successfully}} sued and won {{his case}} against the Daily Mirror for libel over claims made by Mirror TV critic Victor Lewis-Smith that McKenna's degree from LaSalle was merely a purchased [...] "bogus degree", bought {{with the intention of}} deliberately defrauding the public which was found to be totally false. Damages and verdict against The Daily Mirror were the sum of £20,000, but The Mirror's costs possibly totaled over £1 million, which were awarded to him and the judge ordered the Daily Mirror to pay <b>interim</b> <b>costs</b> of £75,000. Justice Eady said (of McKenna's degree) in his summing-up:"Whether it is appropriate to characterise it as scholarship worthy of academic recognition is another matter.

40|$|Abousfian Abdelrazik is a Canadian citizen who, {{after having}} his name added to various anti-terrorism lists, and after being {{tortured}} by Sudanese officials, found himself unable {{to return home}} from Sudan largely because of Canadian government actions. Abdelrazik sought to challenge the constitutionality of these restrictions {{on his ability to}} return to Canada. However, he had no money and no means of support, as he was unable to leave a Canadian embassy in Sudan where he had sought refuge to avoid further torture by Sudanese officials. He therefore brought a motion for <b>interim</b> <b>costs</b> in Canada’s Federal Court. If granted, this <b>interim</b> <b>costs</b> award would require the Canadian government to pay his legal fees so that his constitutional challenge could proceed. In Abdelrazik v Canada (re: <b>Interim</b> <b>Costs),</b> the Federal Court denied the request for <b>interim</b> <b>costs</b> – a decision that has serious implications not only for <b>interim</b> <b>costs</b> jurisprudence, but also for litigation involving citizens who allege that their right to be free from exile accorded by section 6 of the Charter has been violated. This comment critically analyzes the access to justice implications of the Federal Court decision in light of both the principle that courts may use costs awards to promote access to justice, and the unique challenges faced by Canadians mistreated abroad by the Canadian government...|$|E
40|$|Since the 1990 s some European {{countries}} have had regulated health insurance exchanges or have incorporated elements of exchange markets into their health systems. Health reforms in Switzerland and the Netherlands in 1996 and 2006, respectively, created managed {{competition in the}} countries' health insurance markets, which are somewhat analogous to the US state and federally operated health insurance exchanges scheduled to begin operations in 2013 under the Affordable Care Act. We review the Swiss and Dutch experience with exchanges and offer specific lessons for the US exchanges. First, risk-adjustment mechanisms [...] which provide premium adjustments intended to compensate health plans for enrolling people expected to have high medical costs [...] need to be sophisticated and continually updated. Second, {{it is important to}} determine why people eligible for coverage don't enroll and to craft responses that will overcome enrollment barriers. Third, applying for subsidies must be simple. Fourth, insurers will need bargaining power similar to that of providers to create a level playing field for negotiating about prices and quality of services, and <b>interim</b> <b>cost</b> containment measures may be necessary. Fifth and finally, insurers and consumers alike will need meaningful information about providers' costs and quality of care so they can become prudent purchasers of health services, since managed competition among health plans by itself will not substantially drive down health costs...|$|R

40|$|New {{legislation}} and traditional FDIC insolvency-resolution procedures transform and intensify the principal-agent problems {{most responsible for}} the FSLIC mess. These problems explain counterproductive constraints on the governance and operating policies of the agency responsible for rescuing and salvaging assets in insolvent thrifts: the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC). The constraints slow insolvency resolution, increase <b>interim</b> financing <b>costs,</b> and undermine RTC recovery of asset value. Operationalizing its task as preserving evanescent and economically misconceived "franchise values," the RTC allows insolvents to seek financing on an unconsolidated basis, initiates bidding for one institution at a time, holds back seriously troubled assets, and recruits an overly narrow range of bidders.

40|$|At first blush, Caron {{is not a}} very {{interesting}} development in the advance costs jurisprudence. at best it represents a modest “liberalization” of the jurisprudence and may thus make obtaining such awards ever so slightly easier than in the past, even if such awards will always remain “exceptional”. In its deference to the rulings of the lower courts, the Court may have sent a signal that an order for advance costs will be less reviewable than in previous years, so counsel had better plan on getting their orders from the trial court lest there be no order at all. Where Caron {{may turn out to be}} more interesting is not so much on the law of advance costs, but rather on the extent of the superior court’s inherent jurisdiction to come in aid of inferior courts and tribunals. The Court held that superior courts have jurisdiction to come in aid of inferior tribunals where it is “essential to avoid an injustice”, leaving the possibilities for new applications of this rather ancient doctrine intriguing. As well, the Court’s refusal to comment on the correctness of the earlier Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench decision that the provincial court lacked jurisdiction to award <b>interim</b> <b>costs,</b> coupled with Abella J. ’s concurring judgment, leaves open the possibility that inferior courts, and even administrative tribunals, the mselves hold the power to award <b>interim</b> <b>costs</b> in circumstances where the criteria for such an award are otherwise met and where such a power is necessary for the m to perform their intended functions...|$|E

5000|$|During the 2005 renovations to the 91-year-old building, {{the oldest}} of the three {{remaining}} Carnegie libraries in Minneapolis, the City of Minneapolis Library invested $4 million to update Franklin. Originally designed by architect Edward L. Tilton, who specialized in libraries, the structure had served the community but needed significant attention. Funding for the remodeling included monies from the City of Minneapolis Library Referendum and the City of Minneapolis’s Capital Improvement Program. During construction, the library used a building next door to provide continuity of service on a reduced capacity to patrons. This <b>interim</b> site’s operating <b>costs</b> were funded by dedicated members of the community, Friends of Franklin, who worked alongside Friends of the Minneapolis Public Library, to raise over $250,000 to keep library services in the community during the remodeling.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{contains a}} series of theoretical investigations of auction markets. The essays it contains cover wholesale electricity markets, a popular selling mechanism on eBay, and supplier entry into multi-unit procurement auctions. The study in Chapter 1 compares the procurement cost-minimizing and productive efficiency performance of the auction mechanism used by independent system operators in wholesale electricity auction markets in the U. S. {{with that of a}} proposed alternative. The current practice allocates energy contracts as if the auction featured a discriminatory final payment method when, in fact, the markets are uniform price auctions. The proposed alternative explicitly accounts for the market-clearing price during the allocation phase. We find that the proposed alternative largely outperforms the current practice on the basis of procurement costs in the context of simple auction markets featuring both day-ahead and real-time auctions and that the procurement cost advantage of the alternative is complete when we simulate the effects of increased competition. We also find that a tradeoff between the objectives of procurement cost minimization and productive efficiency emerges in our simple auction markets and persists in the face of increased competition. ^ The study in Chapter 2 considers a possible rationale for an auction with a buy price. In an auction with a buy price, the seller provides bidders with an option to end the auction early by accepting a transaction at a posted price. The 2 ̆ 2 Buy-It-Now 2 ̆ 2 option on eBay is a leading example of an auction with a buy price. The study develops a model of an auction with a buy price in which bidders use the auction 2 ̆ 7 s reserve price and buy price to formulate a reference price. The model both explains why a revenue-maximizing seller would want to augment her auction with a buy price and demonstrates that the seller sets a higher reserve price when she can affect the bidders 2 ̆ 7 reference price through the auction 2 ̆ 7 s reserve price and buy price than when she can affect the bidders 2 ̆ 7 reference price through the auction 2 ̆ 7 s reserve price only. Introducing a small reference-price effect can shrink the range of buy prices bidders are willing to exercise. The comparative statics properties of bidding behavior are in sharp contrast to equilibrium behavior in other models where the existence and size of the auction 2 ̆ 7 s buy price have no effect on bidding behavior. ^ The study in Chapter 3 investigates endogenous entry in multi-unit auctions. We formulate and study models of multi-unit discriminatory and uniform price auctions and investigate the entry incentives and procurement costs they generate in equilibrium. We study two types of endogenous entry: in auctions with 2 ̆ 2 <b>interim</b> entry <b>costs,</b> 2 ̆ 2 suppliers know their private cost information before deciding whether or not to undertake entry; in auctions with ex ante entry costs, suppliers do not know their private cost information before deciding whether or not to enter. The discriminatory and uniform price auctions are efficient and procurement cost equivalent in all the environments we study. With <b>interim</b> entry <b>costs,</b> the two auctions provide identical entry incentives. In contrast, with ex ante entry costs, suppliers enter the discriminatory auction at a higher rate than they enter the uniform price auction. ...|$|R
40|$|During 1996, the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) {{developed}} two transuranic (TRU) waste workoff {{strategies that}} were estimated to save $ 270 - 340 M through accelerated waste workoff and {{the elimination of}} a facility. The planning effort included a strategy to assure that LANL would have a significant quantity (3000 + drums) of TRU waste certified for shipment to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) beginning in April of 1998, when WIPP was projected to open. One of the accelerated strategies can be completed in less than ten years through a Total Optimization of Parameters Scenario ({open_quotes}TOPS{close_quotes}). {open_quotes}TOPS{close_quotes} fully utilizes existing LANL facilities and capabilities. For this scenario, funding was estimated to be unconstrained at $ 23 M annually to certify and ship the legacy inventory of TRU waste at LANL. With {open_quotes}TOPS{close_quotes} the inventory is worked off in about 8. 5 years while shipping 5, 000 drums per year at a total cost of $ 196 M. This workoff includes retrieval from earthen cover and <b>interim</b> storage <b>costs.</b> The other scenario envisioned funding at the current level with some increase for TRUPACT II loading costs, which total $ 16 M annually. At this funding level, LANL estimates it will require about 17 years to work off the LANL TRU legacy waste while shipping 2, 500 drums per year to WIPP. The total cost will be $ 277 M. This latter scenario decreases the time for workoff by about 19 years from previous estimates and saves an estimated $ 190 M. In addition, the planning showed that a $ 70 M facility for TRU waste characterization was not needed. After the first draft of the LANL strategies was written, Congress amended the WIPP Land Withdrawal Act (LWA) to accelerate the opening of WIPP to November 1997. Further, the No Migration Variance requirement for the WIPP was removed. This paper discusses the LANL strategies as they were originally developed. 1 ref., 3 figs., 2 tabs...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{exploring}} and describing {{the perceptions of}} relatives of patients with chronic renal failure regarding kidney donation. The number of patients suffering from chronic renal failure awaiting kidney transplantation is on the increase, while the treatment {{they get in the}} <b>interim</b> is not <b>cost</b> effective. The researcher used qualitative descriptive and exploratory research using the Potter and Perry’s Health Belief Model. She applied purposive sampling and used semi structured interviews to collect data from 45 participants who were all relatives of patients coming for haemodialysis at a selected hospital in KwaZulu-Natal. Data analysis identified participants’ perceptions regarding chronic renal failure and kidney donation. Findings of the study revealed that most relatives were fully aware of kidney donation, but fear and lack of knowledge regarding kidney transplantation were the main barriers to them offering themselves for kidney donation. The researcher recommends that the Renal Transplant Multidisciplinary Committee should ensure the public is informed about kidney donation and more intensive education should be given to the relatives of patients suffering from chronic renal failure at an early stage in the illness to give them more time {{to come to terms with}} the concept of kidney donation.

40|$|This report {{presents}} <b>interim</b> {{results on}} <b>cost</b> projections for the supercritical CO 2 Brayton indirect power cycle {{as applied to}} GEN-IV advanced reactors. Design features are reviewed which favor cost effectiveness, such as exploiting the compact nature of this cycle to allow factory fabrication of power conversion modules as large as 300 MWe rating, and their transport to the reactor site in as few as one to three pre-assembled packages. A differential cost comparison procedure is adopted in which projections are made relative to authoritative published cost estimates for related reactor systems such as thermal spectrum HTGRs coupled to direct and indirect cycle helium Brayton power conversion units and to the conventional indirect Rankine steam cycle. It is preliminarily concluded that savings, conservatively {{on the order of}} 10 %, may be achievable, with the dominant parameters being cycle thermodynamic efficiency and turbomachinery capital cost. Approaches to further cost analyses and reduction are identified. 3 Acknowledgements Dr. Pavel Hejzlar has been particularly helpful on all aspects of power cycle design.

40|$|After {{the catastrophic}} 2009 bushfires {{in the state}} of Victoria, Australia, the State Government {{provided}} information and advice, short-term and temporary accommodation as well as financial assistance to bushfire-affected communities. A tension developed between quickly rebuilding housing and re-establishing known social and economic networks versus a slower and more deliberative process that focuses on long-term community outcomes. Whilst there was a wide-spread assumption that quick rebuilding would be beneficial, resulting in immediate pressure to do so, it became evident that many people were not prepared to, or even did not want to rebuild. Thus it became important to provide time and support for people to consider their options away from the immediate pressures to rebuild that are often inherent in post-disaster recovery processes. This became known as "holding the space" and included the introduction of inter-im supports such as building temporary villages and other supports which enable people to achieve appropriate interim accommodation without having to rebuild immediately. However, even two years after the bushfires a significant proportion of people remained undecided whether they wanted to rebuild or not. The post-bushfire experience pointed to a number of lessons including the importance of appropriate timing of post-disaster activities, careful targeting of financial assistance, need for developing better and lower <b>cost</b> <b>interim</b> housing options and pre-impact planning. Given the complex nature of rebuilding following a disaster, design professionals should focus not just on the final house, but also look at housing options that blur the distinction between temporary and permanent. Their designs should be quick to build, offer a good quality of life, be affordable for most and be flexible in design for future use...|$|R
