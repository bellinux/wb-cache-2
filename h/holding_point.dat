The second is a double dedication: firstly to Sir Montague Cholmeley (died 1851 aged 59 years); secondly to Dame Elizabeth, his wife (died 1822), daughter and co-heiress of John Harrison of Norton Place, north from Lincoln. This monument back plate is straight sided with top deeply curved and bottom partly curved.

CAU 408 closure activities will consist of identification and clearance of bomblet target areas, identification and removal of depleted uranium (DU) fragments on South Antelope Lake, and collection of verification samples. Any soil containing contaminants at concentrations above the action levels will be excavated and transported to an appropriate disposal facility. Based on existing information, contaminants of potential concern at CAU 408 include explosives. In addition, at South Antelope Lake, bomblets containing DU were tested. None of these contaminants is expected to be present in the soil at concentrations above the action levels; however, this will be determined by radiological surveys and verification sample results.
