5|$|Developmental verbal <b>dyspraxia,</b> {{also known}} as Childhood apraxia of speech, is a {{developmental}} motor speech disorder involving impairments in the motor control of speech production. The speech {{of a child with}} developmental verbal <b>dyspraxia</b> may be unintelligible to the point that daily communication needs cannot be met. A child with developmental verbal <b>dyspraxia</b> often experiences great amounts of frustration, so AAC can be a strategy to support communication alongside more traditional speech therapy to improve speech production.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of AAC systems have been used with {{children}} with developmental verbal <b>dyspraxia.</b> Manual signs or gestures are frequent introduced to these children, and can {{include the use of}} fingerspelling alongside speech. Manual signs have been shown to decrease errors in articulation. Aided AAC systems typically include communication boards and speech generating devices. A multimodal approach is often used, with several AAC approaches introduced so that the child {{can take advantage of the}} most effective method for a particular situation.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{disorders}} that primarily affect only language skills. Three major pure language disorders are Developmental verbal <b>dyspraxia,</b> specific language impairment, and stuttering. Developmental verbal <b>dyspraxia</b> (DVD) is a disorder where children have errors in consonant and vowel production. Specific language impairment (SLI) is a disorder where {{the patient has}} a lack of language acquisition skills, despite a seemingly normal intelligence level in other areas. Stuttering is a fairly common disorder where speech flow is interrupted by involuntary repetitions of syllables.|$|E

25|$|Neuropsychological evidence:A {{defective}} phonological store {{explains the}} behavior of patients with a specific deficit in phonological short-term memory. Aphasic patients with developmental verbal <b>dyspraxia</b> are unable {{to set up the}} speech motor codes necessary for articulation, caused by a deficiency of the articulatory rehearsal process.|$|E
25|$|Developmental verbal <b>dyspraxia</b> (DVD), {{also known}} as {{childhood}} apraxia of speech (CAS) and developmental apraxia of speech (DAS); is an inability to utilize motor planning to perform movements necessary for speech during a child's language learning process. Although the causes differ between AOS and DVD, the main characteristics and treatments are similar.|$|E

2500|$|One of the articulatory {{characteristics}} of apraxia of speech found in adults includes speech behavior that [...] "exhibits fewer errors with formulaic language than volitional speech".

50|$|Developmental verbal <b>dyspraxia</b> (DVD) {{is a type}} of ideational <b>dyspraxia,</b> causing {{speech and}} {{language}} impairments.

50|$|Developmental {{coordination}} disorder (DCD), {{also known}} as developmental <b>dyspraxia</b> or simply <b>dyspraxia,</b> is a chronic neurological disorder beginning in childhood that can affect planning of movements and co-ordination {{as a result of}} brain messages not being accurately transmitted to the body. Developmental coordination disorder is diagnosed in the absence of other neurological impairments like cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease. It affects 5 to 6 percent of school-aged children. This disorder progresses to adulthood, therefore making it a lifelong condition.|$|E

50|$|Agonistic <b>dyspraxia</b> {{involves}} compulsive automatic {{execution of}} motor commands by one hand {{when the patient}} is asked to perform movements with the other hand. For example, when a patient with callosal damage was instructed to pull a chair forward, the affected hand would decisively and impulsively push the chair backwards.Agonistic <b>dyspraxia</b> can thus {{be viewed as an}} involuntary competitive interaction between the two hands directed toward completion of a desired act in which the affected hand competes with the unaffected hand to complete a purposive act originally intended to be performed by the unaffected hand.|$|E
