25|$|Other factors {{correlated}} with development of pacemaker syndrome include decreased stroke volume, <b>decreased</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>output,</b> and decreased left atrial total emptying fraction associated with ventricular pacing.|$|E
25|$|It is an {{iatrogenic}} disease—an {{adverse effect}} resulting from medical treatment—that is often underdiagnosed. In general, {{the symptoms of}} the syndrome are a combination of <b>decreased</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>output,</b> loss of atrial contribution to ventricular filling, loss of total peripheral resistance response, and nonphysiologic pressure waves.|$|E
25|$|Mechanical {{ventilation}} {{is often}} a life-saving intervention, but carries potential complications including pneumothorax, airway injury, alveolar damage, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. Other complications include diaphragm atrophy, <b>decreased</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>output,</b> and oxygen toxicity. One of the primary complications that presents in patients mechanically ventilated is acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ALI/ARDS are recognized as significant contributors to patient morbidity and mortality.|$|E
30|$|Once identified, {{management}} of congestive hepatopathy primarily involves {{treatment of the}} underlying heart disease, including careful diuresis and efforts to avoid <b>decreasing</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>output.</b>|$|R
50|$|T1AM {{may be part}} of a {{signaling}} pathway to modulate cardiac function, as the compound can induce negative inotropic effects and <b>decrease</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>output.</b>|$|R
25|$|The loss of {{physiologic}} {{timing of}} atrial and ventricular contractions, or sometimes called AV dyssynchrony, leads to different mechanisms of symptoms production. This altered ventricular contraction will <b>decrease</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>output,</b> {{and in turn}} will lead to systemic hypotensive reflex response with varying symptoms.|$|R
25|$|Patients with {{pacemaker}} syndrome exhibit increased plasma {{levels of}} ANP. That's due {{to increase in}} left atrial pressure and left ventricular filling pressure, {{which is due to}} <b>decreased</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>output</b> caused by dyssynchrony in atrial and ventricular contraction. ANP and BNP are potent arterial and venous vasodilators that can override carotid and aortic baroreceptor reflexes attempting to compensate for decreased blood pressure. Usually patients with cannon a waves have higher plasma levels of ANP than those without cannon a waves.|$|E
25|$|While diastolic blood {{pressure}} is diminished and the pulse pressure widens, systolic {{blood pressure}} generally remains normal or can even be slightly elevated, this is because sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis of the kidneys compensate for the <b>decreased</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>output.</b> Catecholamines will increase the heart rate and increase the strength of ventricular contraction, directly increasing cardiac output. Catecholamines will also cause peripheral vasoconstriction, which causes increased systemic vascular resistance and ensures that organs are adequately perfused. Renin, a proteolytic enzyme, cleaves angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is converted to angiotensin II. In the case of chronic aortic insufficiency with resultant cardiac remodeling, heart failure will develop, {{and it is possible}} to see systolic pressures diminish. Aortic insufficiency causes both volume overload (elevated preload) and pressure overload (elevated afterload) of the heart.|$|E
50|$|Secondary hyperaldosteronism {{is often}} related to <b>decreased</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>output</b> which is {{associated}} with elevated renin levels.|$|E
25|$|ACE inhibitors {{block the}} {{conversion}} of angiotensin I (AI) to angiotensin II (AII). They thereby lower arteriolar resistance and increase venous capacity; <b>decrease</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>output,</b> <b>cardiac</b> index, stroke work, and volume; lower resistance in {{blood vessels in the}} kidneys; and lead to increased natriuresis (excretion of sodium in the urine).|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of the high calcium concentration, actin and myosin {{filaments}} will bind stronger, unable to relax properly to make a new contraction possible. This may result in cardiac arrhythmias, in the worst case <b>decreasing</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>output</b> and causing a shortage in oxygen supply in vital tissues.|$|R
50|$|Sodium thiopental <b>decreases</b> the <b>cardiac</b> stroke volume, {{which results}} in a <b>decrease</b> in <b>cardiac</b> <b>output.</b> The <b>decrease</b> in <b>cardiac</b> <b>output</b> occurs in {{conjunction}} with a decrease in systemic vascular resistance, {{which results in}} hypotension. However, in comparison with propofol, the reflex tachycardia seen during states of hypotension is relatively spared (a bradycardia is common after administration of propofol) and therefore the observed fall in blood pressure is generally less severe.|$|R
50|$|Other factors {{correlated}} with development of pacemaker syndrome include decreased stroke volume, <b>decreased</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>output,</b> and decreased left atrial total emptying fraction associated with ventricular pacing.|$|E
50|$|In severe cardiomyopathy, {{the effects}} of <b>decreased</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>output</b> and poor {{perfusion}} become more apparent, and patients will manifest with cold and clammy extremities, cyanosis, claudication, generalized weakness, dizziness, and fainting.|$|E
50|$|The {{decreased}} {{heart rate}} {{can cause a}} <b>decreased</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>output</b> resulting in symptoms such as lightheadedness, dizziness, hypotension, vertigo, and syncope. The slow heart rate may also lead to atrial, junctional, or ventricular ectopic rhythms.|$|E
30|$|Both PEEP and {{position}} influence cardiac function. The {{net effect of}} PEEP on <b>cardiac</b> <b>output</b> is the composite of its effects {{on the right and}} left sides of the heart. PEEP <b>decreases</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>output</b> by limiting right ventricular filling and increasing right heart afterload. By reducing the transmural systolic gradient, PEEP can improve left ventricular function, especially in the setting of decompensated heart failure.|$|R
30|$|One study {{performed}} in humans with intermediate-risk PE {{has reported that}} increase in <b>cardiac</b> <b>output</b> was inversely correlated with RV dilatation before fluid expansion [22]. The larger the right ventricle, the lower the positive effect on <b>cardiac</b> <b>output</b> and hemodynamics. Moreover, an experimental study in PE has shown that volume expansion could be deleterious by increasing RV stress and then <b>decreasing</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>output</b> and blood pressure by its deleterious consequences on the left ventricle [23].|$|R
50|$|The {{causes of}} primary hyperaldosteronism areAdrenal {{hyperplasia}} and Adrenal adenoma(Conn's syndrome).These causes hyperplasia of aldosterone producing cells of adrenal cortex causing primary hyperaldosteronism.The causes of secondary hyperaldosteronism areMassive ascites,Left ventricular failure andCor pulmonale.These either by decreasing circulating fluid volume or by <b>decreasing</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>output</b> causes increase in renin release causing secondary hyperaldosteronism.|$|R
50|$|<b>Decreased</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>output</b> despite normal blood volume, due {{to severe}} {{congestive}} heart failure, large myocardial infarction, heart valve problems, or extremely low heart rate (bradycardia), often produces hypotension and can rapidly progress to cardiogenic shock. Arrhythmias often result in hypotension by this mechanism.|$|E
50|$|Junctional rhythms (if a bradycardia) {{can cause}} <b>decreased</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>output.</b> Therefore, the person may exhibit signs and {{symptoms}} similar to other bradycardia such as lightheadedness, dizziness, hypotension, and syncope. This rhythm can usually be tolerated if the rate is above 50 bpm.|$|E
5000|$|The {{loading dose}} of this {{medicine}} is 15-18 mg/kg administered over 30 to 60 minutes {{for people with}}out insufficient renal function or <b>decreased</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>output</b> and 12 mg/kg for people with this disorders. This can also be described by the formula of the loading dose: ...|$|E
50|$|Reflex Bradycardia is a {{bradycardia}} (decrease {{in heart}} rate) {{in response to}} the baroreceptor reflex, one of the body's homeostatic mechanisms for preventing abnormal increases in blood pressure. In the presence of high mean arterial pressure, the baroreceptor reflex produces a reflex bradycardia as a method of decreasing blood pressure by <b>decreasing</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>output.</b>|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY The {{influence}} of she of acute myocardial infarc-tion on heart rate, Mood pressure, <b>cardiac</b> <b>output,</b> total peripheral resistance (TPR), cardiac rhythm, and mortality was determined in 58 anesthetized cats by occlusion {{of either the}} left anterior descending (LAD), left circumflex or right coronary artery. LAD occlusion resulted In immediate <b>decrease</b> in <b>cardiac</b> <b>output,</b> heart rate, and blood pressure, an increase in TPR, and cardiac rhythm changes including premature ventricular beats, ventricular tachy-cardia, and occasionally ventricular fibrillation. The <b>decrease</b> in <b>cardiac</b> <b>output</b> and increase in TPR persisted in the cats surviving a ventricular arrhythmia. In contrast, right coronary occlusion resulted in a considerably smaller <b>decrease</b> in <b>cardiac</b> <b>output.</b> TPR did not increase, atrioventricular conduction disturbances were common, and sinus bradycardia and hypotension persisted in the cats recovering from an arrhythmia. Left circumflex Ugatio...|$|R
30|$|Hyperoxia <b>decreases</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>output</b> due to both a drop {{of heart}} rate [9] and a rise in {{vascular}} resistance [10]. Supra-physiological oxygen tensions also alter the microperfusion through a decreased capillary perfusion [11] and the systemic perfusion. This hyperoxia-induced vasoconstriction may result from a fall in NO bioavailability [12], with a potential contribution of ROS [13].|$|R
50|$|Mechanical {{ventilation}} {{is often}} a life-saving intervention, but carries potential complications including pneumothorax, airway injury, alveolar damage, and ventilator-associated pneumonia. Other complications include diaphragm atrophy, <b>decreased</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>output,</b> and oxygen toxicity. One of the primary complications that presents in patients mechanically ventilated is acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ALI/ARDS are recognized as significant contributors to patient morbidity and mortality.|$|E
50|$|The {{sympathetic}} and parasympathetic {{branches of the}} autonomic nervous system have opposing effects on blood pressure. Sympathetic activation leads to an elevation of total peripheral resistance and cardiac output via increased contractility of the heart, heart rate, and arterial vasoconstriction, which tends to increase blood pressure. Conversely, parasympathetic activation leads to <b>decreased</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>output</b> via decrease in heart rate, resulting in a tendency to lower blood pressure.|$|E
50|$|Impaired diastolic {{function}} {{can result}} from the decreased compliance of the ventricles, which means the heart cannot stretch as much during filling. This {{will result in a}} reduced end diastolic volume (EDV). According to Frank-Starling forces, a reduced EDV will lead to a reduced stroke volume, thus a reduced cardiac output. Over time, this <b>decreased</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>output</b> will diminish the ability of the heart to circulate blood efficiently throughout the body.|$|E
40|$|Infusing {{arginine}} vasopressin (AVP) in vasodilatory shock usually <b>decreases</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>output</b> and thus systemic oxygen transport. It {{is still a}} matter of debate whether this vasoconstriction impedes visceral organ blood flow and thereby causes organ dysfunction and injury. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis whether low-dose AVP is safe with respect to liver, kidney, and heart function and organ injury during resuscitated septic shock...|$|R
50|$|Blood Pressure (BP) is {{determined}} by <b>cardiac</b> <b>output</b> (CO) and total peripheral resistance (TPR), as represented by the formula BP = CO x TPR. <b>Cardiac</b> <b>output</b> (CO) is affected by two factors, the heart rate (HR) and the stroke volume (SV), the volume of blood pumped from one ventricle of the heart with each beat (CO = HR x SV, therefore BP = HR x SV x TPR). In reflex bradycardia, blood pressure is reduced by <b>decreasing</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>output</b> (CO) via a decrease in heart rate (HR).|$|R
50|$|Initially, diuretics {{lower blood}} {{pressure}} by <b>decreasing</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>output</b> and reducing plasma and extracellular fluid volume. Eventually, <b>cardiac</b> <b>output</b> returns to normal, and plasma and extracellular fluid volume return to slightly less than normal, but a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance is maintained, thus resulting in an overall {{lower blood pressure}}. The reduction in intravascular volume induces an elevation in plasma renin activity and aldosterone secretion, further contributing to the potassium loss associated with thiazide diuretic therapy.|$|R
50|$|Pacemaker {{syndrome}} {{is a disease}} that represents the clinical consequences of suboptimal atrioventricular (AV) synchrony or AV dyssynchrony, regardless of the pacing mode, after pacemaker implantation.It is an iatrogenic disease—an adverse effect resulting from medical treatment—that is often underdiagnosed. In general, the symptoms of the syndrome are a combination of <b>decreased</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>output,</b> loss of atrial contribution to ventricular filling, loss of total peripheral resistance response, and nonphysiologic pressure waves.|$|E
50|$|The classic sign of {{pericarditis}} is a friction rub heard with a stethoscope on {{the cardiovascular}} examination usually {{on the lower}} left sternal border. Other physical signs include a patient in distress, positional chest pain, diaphoresis (excessive sweating), and possibility of heart failure in form of pericardial tamponade causing pulsus paradoxus, and the Beck's triad of low blood pressure (due to <b>decreased</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>output),</b> distant (muffled) heart sounds, and distension of the jugular vein (JVD).|$|E
50|$|Orthostatic {{hypotension}} {{is caused}} primarily by gravity-induced blood pooling {{in the lower}} extremities, which in turn compromises venous return, resulting in <b>decreased</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>output</b> and subsequent lowering of arterial pressure. For example, changing from a lying position to standing loses about 700 ml of blood from the thorax, with a decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressures. The overall effect is an insufficient blood perfusion in {{the upper part of}} the body.|$|E
30|$|Introduction In the {{intensive}} care unit (ICU), the presence of edema after the initial phase of fluid resuscitation is an independent poor prognostic factor. The fluid removal (using diuretics or during renal replacement therapy) is an important component of care. However, the depletion can <b>decrease</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>output</b> and provoke hypotension. Therefore, it can be harmful. Our objective was to determine factors for poor hemodynamic tolerance to fluid removal.|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) in mechanically ventilated (MV) patients with {{acute respiratory distress}} syndrome (ARDS) <b>decreases</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>output</b> (CO). Accurate measurement of CO is highly invasive and is not ideal for all MV critically ill patients. However, {{the link between the}} PEEP used in MV, and CO provides an opportunity to assess CO via MV therapy and other existing measurements, creating a CO measure without further invasiveness...|$|R
30|$|Second, PEEP could {{actually}} change {{the volume of}} EVLWI through, here again, opposite mechanisms. By <b>decreasing</b> <b>cardiac</b> <b>output,</b> PEEP may reduce the pulmonary microvascular hydrostatic pressure and hence EVLWI [63]. Also, during ARDS, by increasing the central venous pressure, PEEP could impede the lymphatic drainage of EVLWI [64]. By contrast, during hydrostatic pulmonary oedema, PEEP could contribute to the decrease in EVLWI by improving cardiac function through its own haemodynamic effects [65].|$|R
