5|$|In 2010, the USDA {{reported}} that data on overall <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> losses {{for the year}} indicate an estimated 34% loss, which is statistically similar to losses reported in 2007, 2008, and 2009. In 2011, the loss was 30%. In 2012–2013, CCD was blamed {{for the loss of}} about half of the US <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> hives, far more than the 33% losses observed on average over previous years.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{invasion}} of generalist Africanized <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> may change certain plant-pollinator interactions. We evaluated the preemption by <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> and the exploitative competition with native bees {{on a tree}} with nocturnally dehiscent small flowers. Our main objectives were to quantify pollen production and harvesting, to verify whether <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> exploitatively compete with native bees and to identify the effective pollinators of Spondias mombin. The nocturnally dehiscent flowers were pollen depleted by <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> and attracted various nocturnal and diurnal bee species. A threefold increase in native bee abundance was produced by delaying pollen availability and by preventing the preemption of pollen by <b>honey</b> <b>bees.</b> The results suggest that <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> reduce the foraging benefit of late-arriving native <b>bees.</b> <b>Honey</b> <b>bees</b> and Scaptotrigona aff. tubiba were regarded as the main effective pollinators of S. mombin due to their abundance, behavior, and ability to visit {{a large number of}} flowers...|$|R
40|$|African <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> (Apis mellifera scutellata) {{are native}} to sub-Saharan Africa and were {{introduced}} in the Americas to improve honey production in the tropics. These African <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> were accidentally released and began to interbreed with European <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> (Apis mellifera ligustica), the most common subspecies used for pollination and honey production in the United States (Fig. 1). As a result, the hybrid offspring are called “Africanized” because of their shared characteristics. Africanized <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> {{are about the same}} size, shape and color as European <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> (Fig. 2), and a genetic analysis must be used to distinguish one from the other...|$|R
5|$|The {{phenomenon}} {{is particularly important}} for crops such as almond growing in California, where honey bees are the predominant pollinator and the crop value in 2011 was $3.6 billion. In 2000, the total U.S. crop value that was wholly dependent on <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> pollination was estimated to exceed $15 billion. Because of such high demand in pollinators, the cost of renting honey bees has increased significantly, and California's almond industry rents approximately 1.6 million <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> colonies during the spring to pollinate their crop. Worldwide, honeybees yield roughly $200 billion in pollination services.|$|E
5|$|Among insects, {{so-called}} killer bees were accidentally {{created during}} {{an attempt to}} breed a strain of bees that would both produce more honey and be better adapted to tropical conditions. It was done by crossing a European <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> and an African bee.|$|E
5|$|However {{farmers have}} focused on {{alternative}} solutions in order to mitigate these problems. By raising native plants, they provide food for native bee pollinators like L. vierecki and L. leucozonium, leading to less reliance on <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> populations.|$|E

40|$|Field cage {{tests were}} run to {{determine}} if <b>honey</b> <b>bees,</b> Apis mellifera L., flies, Musca domestica L., {{or a combination of}} the two would provide the best pollination for carrot germplasm seed increase. In 1985, <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> alone were significantly better pollinators than flies alone, but in 1988, a combination of <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> and flies produced more carrot seed per cage than did <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> or flies alone. Seed obtained by using the two pollinators did not differ significantly in 100 seed weight or germination percentage. Considerable time savings resulted from using insect pollinators rather than hand pollination. In the future, the North Central Regional Plant Introduction Station will use a combination of <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> and flies to pollinate carrots for germplasm seed increase...|$|R
5|$|Humans {{have kept}} <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> colonies, {{commonly}} in hives, for millennia. Beekeepers collect honey, beeswax, propolis, pollen, and royal jelly from hives; bees are also kept to pollinate crops and to produce bees {{for sale to}} other beekeepers.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, {{a team of}} {{scientists}} led by the National Institute of Beekeeping in Bologna, Italy, found pollen obtained from seeds dressed with imidacloprid contain significant levels of the insecticide, and suggested the polluted pollen might cause <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> colony death. Analysis of maize and sunflower crops originating from seeds dressed with imidacloprid suggest large amounts of the insecticide will be carried back to <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> colonies. Sublethal doses of imidacloprid in sucrose solution have also been documented to affect homing and foraging activity of honey bees. Imidacloprid in sucrose solution fed to bees in the laboratory impaired their communication for a few hours. Sublethal doses of imidacloprid in laboratory and field experiment decreased flight activity and olfactory discrimination, and olfactory learning performance was impaired.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, a {{sequencing}} of the <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> genome provided {{a possible explanation}} for the sensitivity of bees to pesticides. Its genome is deficient in the number of genes encoding detoxification enzymes, including cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), glutathione-S-transferases, and carboxylesterases.|$|E
50|$|In Japan, beekeepers often prefer European <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> {{because they}} are more {{productive}} than the endemic Japanese <b>honey</b> <b>bees.</b> However, {{it can be difficult to}} maintain a captive hive of European <b>honey</b> <b>bees,</b> as the giant hornets are devastating to the bee hives. Once a Japanese giant hornet has located a hive of European <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> it leaves pheromone markers around it that quickly attract nest-mates to converge on the hive. An individual hornet can kill forty European <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> a minute while a group of 30 hornets can destroy an entire hive containing 30,000 bees in less than four hours. The hornets kill and dismember the bees, returning to their nest with the bee thoraxes, which they feed to their larvae, leaving heads and limbs behind. The <b>honey</b> and <b>bee</b> larvae are also taken to feed the hornet larvae.|$|R

5|$|Insects used in food include <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> larvae and pupae, mopani worms, silkworms, Maguey worms, Witchetty grubs, crickets, {{grasshoppers}} and locusts. In Thailand, {{there are}} 20,000 farmers rearing crickets, producing some 7,500 tons per year.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduced}} European <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> (Apis mellifera) {{has also}} been observed feeding on B.sessilis, as have seven species of native bee, comprising four species of Hylaeus (including the banksia bee H. alcyoneus), two of Leioproctus, and a Lasioglossum.|$|E
5|$|During {{the spring}} of 2015, President Barack Obama {{unveiled}} the very first national strategy for improving the health of bees and other key pollinators. The plan calls for restoring 7 million acres of bee habitat {{with a variety of}} different flowering plants for bees to gather nectar from. The administration is also proposing spending $82.5 million for <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> research.|$|E
40|$|Heat {{shielding}} is {{a recently}} identified mechanism used by worker <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> (Apis mellifera) {{to help maintain}} constant hive temperatures. Only workers perform this behavior; in our experiment, drones actively avoided heated hive regions. Observations of marked day-old cohorts within broodcomb regions indicate that heat shielding is performed by young bees to preferentially protect advanced stage larvae and pupae. As expected, the number of heat-shielders significantly increased with both {{the temperature of the}} heat source {{and the size of the}} colony. Of the young bees observed to perform the behavior, those aged 12 – 14 days were significantly more likely to heat-shield than expected. Combined, these data suggest that classifications of age-based tasks in <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> should include heat shielding, and that the behavior is an adaptation designed to protect temperaturesensitive brood. Key words: age polyethism, Apis mellifera, <b>honey</b> <b>bees,</b> thermoregulation. [Behav Ecol] <b>Honey</b> <b>bees</b> have been shown to use temperature to thwart disease (Starks et al., 2000) and predators (Ono et al., 1995). But perhaps the most impressive temperature-related characteristic of <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> is simple maintenance: <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> (Apis mellifera) maintain colony temperatures throughout the year (Heinrich, 1980, 1985; Seeley, 1985). <b>Honey</b> <b>bees</b> are hardly alone in this regard as many social animals produce structures within which temperature control is importan...|$|R

5|$|Growth {{in the use}} of {{neonicotinoid}} pesticides has roughly tracked rising bee deaths. In 2015, an 11-year British {{study showed}} a definitive relationship between increasing agricultural use of neonicotinoid and escalating <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> colony losses at a landscape level. This is the first field study to establish a link between neonicotinoids and CCD.|$|E
5|$|In Germany, {{where some}} of the first reports of CCD in Europe appeared, and where, {{according}} to the German national association of beekeepers, 40% of the <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> colonies died, there was no scientific confirmation; in early May 2007, the German media reported no confirmed CCD cases seemed to have occurred in Germany.|$|E

50|$|Beekeepers in Japan {{attempted}} to introduce European <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> (Apis mellifera) {{for the sake}} of their high productivity. However, European <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> have no innate defense against Japanese giant hornets, which can rapidly destroy their colonies.|$|R
40|$|International audienceAbstractThe {{stock of}} <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> in the {{northern}} neotropics is likely a composite of European and African lineages, but the genetic makeup of most populations in this region has remained unstudied. We analyzed the genetic composition of <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> across temperate and tropical regions of Mexico using mitochondrial and morphometric analyses. The results showed that <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> from Mexico are descendent almost in similar proportion from matrilines of African and European origins. However, morphometrics indicate that most colonies {{are the result of}} extensive introgressive hybridization with Africanized bees. While large-scale displacement of European <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> seems to have occurred in the tropical regions, higher frequencies of colonies with a mixed range of African-European markers were identified in the temperate areas. Our results suggest that the outcome of the hybridization between Africanized and European <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> in Mexico has been significantly associated with climate...|$|R
5|$|Workers in {{colonies of}} the Asian <b>honey</b> <b>bee,</b> Apis florea, are also {{reported}} {{to engage in}} oophagy. Using microsatellite analysis, researchers concluded that no mature drones had non-queen alleles in the colonies they investigated. Thus, even though workers had activated ovaries and were capable of laying eggs, worker policing ensured the functional sterility of otherwise fertile workers.|$|E
5|$|Colony {{collapse}} disorder causes {{significant economic}} losses because many agricultural crops (although no staple foods) worldwide are pollinated by western honey bees. According to the Agriculture and Consumer Protection Department of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, {{the worth of}} global crops with <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> pollination was estimated at close to $200 billion in 2005. Shortages of bees in the US have increased the cost to farmers renting them for pollination services by up to 20%.|$|E
5|$|Honey {{bees are}} not {{native to the}} Americas, {{therefore}} their necessity as pollinators in the U.S. and other regions in the Western Hemisphere is limited to strictly agricultural/ornamental uses, as no native plants require <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> pollination, except where concentrated in monoculture situations—where the pollination need is so great at bloom time that pollinators must be concentrated beyond the capacity of native bees (with current technology).|$|E
25|$|For example, European <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> (Apis mellifera) forage at older {{ages and}} harvest less pollen and more {{concentrated}} nectar. The differences in resources emphasized during harvesting {{are a result}} of the European <b>honey</b> <b>bee's</b> sensitivity to sucrose at higher concentrations.|$|R
