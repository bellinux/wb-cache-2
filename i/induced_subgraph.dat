5|$|As a {{consequence}} of bounded expansion, the subgraph isomorphism problem, of finding whether a pattern graph of bounded size exists as a subgraph of a larger graph, can be solved in linear time when the larger graph has bounded book thickness. The {{same is true for}} detecting whether the pattern graph is an <b>induced</b> <b>subgraph</b> of the larger graph, or whether it has a graph homomorphism to the larger graph. For the same reason, the problem of testing whether a graph of bounded book thickness obeys a given formula of first order logic is fixed-parameter tractable.|$|E
5|$|In these applications, one forms a graph {{in which}} each vertex {{represents}} a matched pair of atoms, one from each of two molecules. Two vertices are connected by an edge if the matches that they represent are compatible with each other. Being compatible may mean, for instance, that the distances between the atoms within the two molecules are approximately equal, to within some given tolerance. A clique in this graph represents a set of matched pairs of atoms {{in which all the}} matches are compatible with each other. A special case of this method is the use of the modular product of graphs to reduce the problem of finding the maximum common <b>induced</b> <b>subgraph</b> of two graphs to the problem of finding a maximum clique in their product.|$|E

40|$|An {{undirected graph}} G {{is called a}} VPT graph {{if it is the}} vertex {{intersection}} graph of a family of paths in a tree. The class of graphs which admit a VPT representation in a host tree with maximum degree at most h is denoted by [h, 2, 1]. The classes [h, 2, 1] are closed by taking <b>induced</b> <b>subgraphs,</b> therefore each one can be characterized by a family of minimal forbidden <b>induced</b> <b>subgraphs.</b> In this paper we associate the minimal forbidden <b>induced</b> <b>subgraphs</b> for [h, 2, 1] which are VPT with (color) h-critical graphs. We describe how to obtain minimal forbidden <b>induced</b> <b>subgraphs</b> from critical graphs, even more, we show that the family of graphs obtained using our procedure is exactly the family of VPT minimal forbidden <b>induced</b> <b>subgraphs</b> for [h, 2, 1]. The members of this family together with the minimal forbidden <b>induced</b> <b>subgraphs</b> for VPT, are the minimal forbidden <b>induced</b> <b>subgraphs</b> for [h, 2, 1], with h≥ 3. Notice that by taking h= 3 we obtain a characterization by minimal forbidden <b>induced</b> <b>subgraphs</b> of the class VPT ∩ EPT=EPT ∩ Chordal=[3, 2, 2]=[3, 2, 1]...|$|R
50|$|Well-quasi-ordering {{implies that}} any {{property}} of graphs that is monotonic {{with respect to}} <b>induced</b> <b>subgraphs</b> has finitely many forbidden <b>induced</b> <b>subgraphs,</b> and therefore may be tested in polynomial time on graphs of bounded tree-depth.

25|$|In graph theory, {{a branch}} of {{discrete}} mathematics, a distance-hereditary graph (also called a completely separable graph) is a graph in which the distances in any connected <b>induced</b> <b>subgraph</b> {{are the same as}} they are in the original graph.

40|$|AbstractThe {{notion of}} distance-heredity in graphs has been {{extended}} to construct the class of almost distance-hereditary graphs (an increase of the distance by one unit is allowed by <b>induced</b> <b>subgraphs).</b> These graphs have been characterized in terms of forbidden <b>induced</b> <b>subgraphs</b> [M. Aïder, Almost distance-hereditary graphs, Discrete Math. 242 (1 – 3) (2002) 1 – 16]. Since the distance in bipartite graphs cannot increase exactly by one unit, we have to adapt this notion to the bipartite case. In this paper, we define the class of bipartite almost distance-hereditary graphs (an increase of the distance by two is allowed by <b>induced</b> <b>subgraphs)</b> and obtain a characterization in terms of forbidden <b>induced</b> <b>subgraphs...</b>|$|R
25|$|If H is an <b>induced</b> <b>subgraph</b> of a cograph G, then H {{is itself}} a cograph; the cotree for H may be formed by {{removing}} some of the leaves from the cotree for G and then suppressing nodes that have only one child. It follows from Kruskal's tree theorem that the relation of being an <b>induced</b> <b>subgraph</b> is a well-quasi-ordering on the cographs. Thus, if a subfamily of the cographs (such as the planar cographs) is closed under <b>induced</b> <b>subgraph</b> operations then it has {{a finite number of}} forbidden induced subgraphs. Computationally, this means that testing membership in such a subfamily may be performed in linear time, by using a bottom-up computation on the cotree of a given graph to test whether it contains any of these forbidden subgraphs. However, when the sizes of two cographs are both variable, testing whether one of them is an <b>induced</b> <b>subgraph</b> of the other is NP-complete.|$|E
