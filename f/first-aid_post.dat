40|$|Multidisciplinary care of {{prostate}} cancer is increasingly offered in specialised cancer centres. It requires the optimisation of medical and operational processes and {{the integration of the}} different medical and non-medical stakeholders. To develop a standardised operational process assessment tool basing on the capability maturity model integration (CMMI) able to implement multidisciplinary care and improve process quality and efficiency. Information for model development was derived from medical experts, clinical guidelines, best practice elements of renowned cancer centres, and scientific literature. Data were organised in a hierarchically structured model, consisting of 5 categories, 30 key process areas, 172 requirements, and more than 1500 criteria. Compliance with requirements was assessed through structured on-site surveys covering all relevant clinical and management processes. Comparison with best practice standards allowed to recommend improvements. 'Act On Oncology'(AoO) was applied in a pilot study on a prostate cancer unit in Europe. Several best practice elements such as multidisciplinary clinics or advanced organisational measures for patient scheduling were observed. Substantial opportunities were found in other areas such as centre management and infrastructure. As first improvements the evaluated centre administration described and formalised the organisation of the prostate cancer unit with defined personnel assignments and clinical activities and a formal agreement is being worked on to have structured access to <b>First-Aid</b> <b>Posts.</b> In the pilot study, the AoO approach was feasible to identify opportunities for process improvements.

5000|$|For {{accidents}} and medical emergencies everybody can {{call on the}} emergency services. There are 2 phone numbers to contact the Emergency Services Network, 100 or 112. 100 gives access to the Ambulance service or Fire department. In larger cities the Fire department operates the Ambulances, elsewhere Ambulances might be allocated to hospitals. 112 gives access to the Police, Ambulance Services and Fire department. The dispatching centers for the 100 and 112 services, dispatches an available ambulance from the closest hospital or ambulance center. The operator is qualified to decide to dispatch a MER-vehicle. Additionally, the Red Cross operates an number of ambulances as do privately owned companies that operate ambulances for the emergency network. The Red Cross {{and a number of}} other [...] "cross" [...] charities own ambulances and have volunteers that man <b>first-aid</b> <b>posts</b> during events like football matches, cycling races, sports or other mass events. They don't participate in the daily Emergency services network, but they do liberate the Emergency Services network from allocating too many assets and resources during those mass events. Calling an ambulance is not a free service. The ambulance will bring the patient to the nearest hospital. An ambulance is manned by two people - a driver and a paramedic. Depending on the medical condition, a Medical Emergency Response vehicle may be dispatched. That is manned by three people - a driver, an ER-doctor and a senior ER-nurse. The ER-doctor will choose the nearest appropriate hospital that has the necessary facilities based on the patient's symptoms and condition, or a hospital in which the patient is under active treatment.|$|R
40|$|Papua New Guinea (PNG) {{has one of}} {{the most}} underperforming health systems in the Asia-Pacific region, despite several {{incentives}} undertaken in the past decade. This paper explores non-clinical leadership and management context, barriers and issues of health delivery in Madang Province, PNG. Health services are decentralised with leadership and management roles, finance and service delivery devolved to provincial and district governments. Provincial authorities retain significant autonomy and compelled to follow national policy directives. Findings point to important leadership and management barriers including ineffective leadership and management competencies and weak political and institutional capacity. There is the paucity of research in health services leadership and management in developing nations in the Asia-Pacific region. This research engages a qualitative design based on semi-structured interviews with health leaders and managers in Madang Province. Interviews were recorded, subject to discourse analysis then findings were evaluated against extant literature. This study contributes to the literature by exploring health leadership and management at provincial and district levels in one of PNG's twenty provinces. The findings help to better understand the complex interplay of factors in health delivery in a developing country. Leadership, supported by competent management are intuitively recognised as important drivers of change and innovation and often cited as critical elements in achieving successful health outcomes (Buttigieg & West, 2013). Much of the extant leadership and management literature attempts to identify how leaders and managers influence organisational outcomes primarily Western corporate business life. Underpinned by psychology and positivist social science methodologies research has characterised traits, styles, attributes, competencies and behaviours of individual managers and leaders (Evans et al., 2014). More recently, context barriers and issues have received increasing research attention in recognition that different situations require different leadership and management approaches (Jepson, 2009; Prideaux, 2013). This study examines non-clinical leadership and management in Papua New Guinea (PNG) to extend our understanding of context, barriers and issues in the health sector in a developing nation. The healthcare sector continually faces the challenge of delivering high quality care to those who need it, at an affordable cost (Littlejohns, Weale, Chalkidou, Faden, & Teerawattananon, 2012); is crucial to improving population health and reducing premature mortality (Macinko, Starfield, & Shi, 2003), and contributes to a nations quality of life. Further, the sector is undergoing significant transformation (Gaynor & Hass-Wilson, 1999; Kumar, Subramanian, & Strandholm, 2002) which demands leadership and management capacity at least equalling the ongoing change context. In this regard, PNG is no exception. The sector is staffed by clinical and non-clinical professionals who need the appropriate capacity, competencies and frameworks to deliver advocated health outcomes. Health professions, chiefly clinical staff are traditionally one of the most studied professions. Notwithstanding, many studies focus on medical specialists and nurses (Chan, Chien, & Tso, 2009; Prows & Saldanna, 2009) or on health executives only. However, there are few studies of non-clinical health service leaders and managers (non-executives) working in healthcare facilities in rural areas of developing countries (Carvalho, 2012; Mohd-Shamsudin & Chuttipattana, 2012). The majority of health service leaders and managers in Madang Province live and work in non-urban areas, often with limited communication facilities and basic infrastructure. Nonetheless, they are responsible for planning, organising, staffing, directing and controlling health care systems at the local level (Jarunee, 2007; Ministry of Health, 2001) with inadequate resources, training or support. This study aims to explore the factors influencing leadership and management of health delivery from a non-clinical perspective. By shedding light on the context, barriers and issues impacting on health sector leaders and managers, the dynamic and complex interplay of influences can be examined and may provide important insights for health system improvements. The study investigates leadership and management in <b>first-aid</b> <b>posts,</b> regional and district health centres at the provincial and district levels as an indicator of the broader PNG context. Previous studies have concentrated on the PNG health system from the national perspective rather than at the regional level. A review of the health system in PNG is presented first, and then extant literature is briefly reviewed to derive themes impacting on health delivery. Next, the methods adopted for this study are outlined, and findings discussed. Finally, implications and directions for future research are given...|$|R

It should be mentioned that Taghiyev sold his oil companies in order to diversify into other industries of the Caucasus's economy. He amassed shares in the Oleum Company established on the basis of these enterprises to the amount of 16 million rubles. This allowed him to continue accumulating capital created in the oil sector.

Shortly afterwards Rodd, who had been commissioned into the Welsh Guards, departed overseas. Alone in London, Mitford moved to the family's Rutland Gate house where she remained during the London blitz. The main house had been requisitioned to provide a refuge for Jewish families evacuated from the bombed areas of the East End. Mitford spent much of her time looking after these families, [...] "so hard-working, clean and grateful". A brief affair with a Free French officer, André Roy, resulted in a third pregnancy. Mitford again miscarried, with complications that led, in November 1941, to a hysterectomy. After convalescence, at a loose end, she began working as an assistant at the Heywood Hill bookshop in Curzon Street. The shop became the centre of Mitford's daily activities, and was a favoured meeting place for London's literati. In September 1942 she met Gaston Palewski, a French colonel attached to General Charles de Gaulle's London staff. She found him fascinating, and he became the love of her life—though her feelings were never fully reciprocated—and an inspiration for much of her future writing. For the sake of Mitford's reputation the affair was pursued with discretion, before Palewski left for Algeria in May 1943. Thereafter the relationship was conducted mainly by letters and occasional phone calls, since Palewski was only intermittently in England before the end of the war.|$|E
