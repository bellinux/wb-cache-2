5|$|As well as {{discovering}} new techniques, Messiaen {{found and}} absorbed exotic music, including Ancient Greek rhythms, Hindu rhythms (he encountered Śārṅgadeva's list of 120 rhythmic units, the deçî-tâlas), Balinese and Javanese <b>Gamelan,</b> birdsong, and Japanese music (see Example 1 for {{an instance of}} his use of ancient Greek and Hindu rhythms).|$|E
5|$|Kulintang {{belongs to}} the larger unit/stratum of “knobbed gong-chime culture” {{prevalent}} in Southeast Asia. It {{is considered one of}} the region’s three major gong ensembles, alongside the <b>gamelan</b> of western Indonesia and piphat of Thailand, Burma, Cambodia and Laos, which use gongs and not wind or string instruments to carry the melodic part of the ensemble. Like the other two, kulintang music is primarily orchestral with several rhythmic parts orderly stacked one upon another. It is also based upon the pentatonic scale. However, kulintang music differs in many aspects from <b>gamelan</b> music, primarily in the way the latter constructs melodies within a framework of skeletal tones and prescribed time interval of entry for each instruments. The framework of kulintang music is more flexible and time intervals are nonexistent, allowing for such things as improvisations to be more prevalent.|$|E

5|$|In 1976 Tippett {{was awarded}} the Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society. The {{following}} few years saw journeys to Java and Bali—where he was much attracted by the sounds of <b>gamelan</b> ensembles—and to Australia, where he conducted a performance of his Fourth Symphony in Adelaide. In 1979, with funds available {{from the sale of}} some of his original manuscripts to the British Library, Tippett inaugurated the Michael Tippett Musical Foundation, which provided financial support to young musicians and music education initiatives.|$|E
5|$|Soegija {{arrived in}} Muntilan in September 1926, where he began {{teaching}} algebra, religion, and Javanese at Xaverius. Little {{is known about}} his period as an instructor at the school, although records indicate that he based his teaching style on that of van Lith, {{who had died in}} early 1926, explaining religious concepts in terms based on Javanese tradition. He supervised the school's <b>gamelan</b> and gardening programs and became the chief editor of Swaratama. Soegijapranata wrote editorials that covered a variety of topics, including condemnations of communism and discussions of various aspects of poverty.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{screened}} on 31December 1926 at the Oriental and Elita Theatres in Bandung, {{making it the}} first domestically-produced feature film and the first with a native cast. The advertisements were in both Dutch- and Malay-language publications. The film was screened for only a week, with live Sundanese <b>gamelan</b> performances providing music, after which Loetoeng Kasaroeng was replaced with Hollywood films. Although its box office performance is not recorded, it {{is thought to have}} been poor.|$|E

50|$|The gong suwukan or gong siyem is {{the smaller}} gong {{in the set}} used for smaller phrases. It is {{generally}} pitched higher, and at different pitches for pélog and sléndro.

50|$|Sharon's {{theme is}} sombre and introspective, {{representative}} of the inner conflict common to both principal copies of Number Eight (Sharon) featured in the series. This theme is occasionally played in ethnic woodwinds or by a string orchestra, but almost always performed by an ensemble of <b>gamelans</b> and bells.|$|R
5|$|While {{a student}} he {{composed}} his first published works—his eight Préludes for piano (the earlier Le banquet céleste was published subsequently). These exhibit Messiaen's {{use of his}} modes of limited transposition and palindromic rhythms (Messiaen called these non-retrogradable rhythms). His public début came in 1931 with his orchestral suite Les offrandes oubliées. That year he first heard a <b>gamelan</b> group, sparking {{his interest in the}} use of tuned percussion.|$|E
5|$|Already {{a friend}} of the {{composer}} Aaron Copland, Britten encountered his latest works Billy the Kid and An Outdoor Overture, both of which influenced his own music. In 1940 Britten composed Seven Sonnets of Michelangelo, the first of many song cycles for Pears. Britten's orchestral works from this period include the Violin Concerto and Sinfonia da Requiem. In 1941 Britten produced his first music drama, Paul Bunyan, an operetta, to a libretto by Auden. While in the US, Britten had his first encounter with Balinese <b>gamelan</b> music, through transcriptions for piano duo made by the Canadian composer Colin McPhee. The two met in the summer of 1939 and subsequently performed a number of McPhee's transcriptions for a recording. This musical encounter bore fruit in several Balinese-inspired works later in Britten's career.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{overseeing}} the new clergy, Soegijapranata {{continued to work}} towards Catholic education and prosperity, similar to his pre-war work. He emphasised that students must not only be good Catholics, but also good Indonesians. The Church began further development of its schools, ranging from elementary schools to universities. Soegijapranata also began reforming the Church in his apostolic vicariate, making it more Indonesian. He advocated the use of local languages and Indonesian during mass, allowing it throughout his diocese beginning in 1956. In addition, he pressed {{for the use of}} <b>gamelan</b> music to accompany services, and agreed to the use of wayang shows to teach the Bible to children.|$|E

50|$|At {{the lowest}} level of the temple to the south is a large wantilan where general {{meetings}} and activities such as the ritual cockfight are enacted. Steps leads to the upper level of the outer sanctum. On the upper level, there are two pairs of bale gong ("gong pavilion") where the <b>gamelans</b> are stored. A highly ornate bale kulkul (slit-drum tower) is located in this area close to the street. The bale kulkul is used to make announcement. A large tree grew at the steps leading to the outer sanctum. This tree is also a shrine dedicated to Ratu Gede Macan, spirit of a tiger.|$|R
5|$|Chrisye {{stopped playing}} {{altogether}} until the Nasutions {{invited him to}} rejoin Gipsy for their new project with Guruh, who offered Chrisye several songs {{in which he would}} be lead singer, with lyrics written especially for him. Overcoming his depression, he joined the group as they practised at Guruh's house in Kebayoran Baru, South Jakarta. The band often rehearsed late into the night; the indie project mixed Western rock and Balinese <b>gamelan</b> and was produced collaboratively. Recording took place in mid-1975, with only four songs completed in the first several months. It was released to critical acclaim in 1976, with a production of 5000copies. The success of Guruh Gipsy convinced Chrisye that he could sing as a soloist.|$|E
5|$|In 1888 Ravel met {{the young}} pianist Ricardo Viñes, who became {{not only a}} lifelong friend, but {{also one of the}} {{foremost}} interpreters of his works, and an important link between Ravel and Spanish music. The two shared an appreciation of Wagner, Russian music, and the writings of Poe, Baudelaire, and Mallarmé. At the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1889, Ravel was much struck by the new Russian works conducted by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. This music had a lasting effect on both Ravel and his older contemporary Claude Debussy, as did the exotic sound of the Javanese <b>gamelan,</b> also heard during the Exposition.|$|E
5|$|The {{aesthetic}} and technical mastery of Borobudur, and also its sheer size, has evoked {{the sense of}} grandeur and pride for Indonesians. Just like Angkor Wat for Cambodian, Borobudur has become a powerful symbol for Indonesia — to testify for its past greatness. Sukarno {{made a point of}} showing the site to foreign dignitaries. The Suharto regime — realized its important symbolic and economic meanings — diligently embarked on a massive project to restore the monument with the help from UNESCO. Many museums in Indonesia contain a scale model replica of Borobudur. The monument has become almost an icon, grouped with the wayang puppet play and <b>gamelan</b> music into a vague classical Javanese past from which Indonesians are to draw inspiration.|$|E

5000|$|McPhee {{was born}} in Montreal. He {{enrolled}} in the Peabody Institute in 1918, studying composition with Gustav Strube and piano with Harold Randolph; subsequently he studied with the avant-garde composer Edgard Varèse before marrying Jane Belo, a disciple of Margaret Mead, in 1931. He {{was involved in the}} circle of experimental composers known as the [...] "ultra-modernists" [...] and was among those—along with the group's leader, Henry Cowell, John Becker, and Cowell protégé Lou Harrison—particularly interested in what would later become known as [...] "world music." [...] McPhee is said to have first encountered Balinese music while listening to a record in New York City. He and his wife moved to Bali together for Belo's anthropological work. Once there McPhee became so interested in the music that he studied, built, and wrote extensively about the <b>gamelans.</b> McPhee, who was gay, divorced Belo in 1939. In the early 1940s he lived in a large brownstone in Brooklyn, which he shared with W. H. Auden and Benjamin Britten, among others.|$|R
5|$|The kulintang player’s {{ability to}} improvise within the {{parameters}} of a rhythmic mode is a must. As with <b>gamelan</b> orchestras, each kulintang mode {{has a kind of}} theme the kulintang player “dresses up” by variations of ornamentation, manipulating segments by inserting repetitions, extensions, insertions, suspensions, variations and transpositions. This occurs at the discretion of the kulintang player. Therefore, the kulintang player functions not only as the one carrying the melody, but also as the conductor of the entire ensemble. She determines the length of each rendition and could change the rhythm at any time, speeding up or slowing down, accord to her personal taste and the composition she plays.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Trunajaya's forces harassed the loyalist army. They had {{fortified}} posts {{along the}} river, {{especially on the}} east bank. These were equipped with cannons of various sizes up to twelve-pounders. Trunajaya's artillery continuously pounded the loyalists, even reaching Hurdt and Amangkurat's lodgings, {{as well as the}} army's field hospital. The loyalist army also had cannons, but it did not return fire, saving its limited ammunition for the eventual attack on Kediri. In addition, Trunajaya's cavalry also engaged in skirmishes with the loyalists, causing casualties and undermining their morale. On 21 October, a night attack led by Raden Suradipa burned the VOC's Malay troops' quarters. However, the attack was repelled and Suradipa, one of Trunajaya's brothers, was fatally wounded. On the night of 2–3 November, Trunajaya's skirmishers intimidated the VOC's sentries with the music of <b>gamelan</b> and mocking voices.|$|E
5|$|The {{power of}} stories to {{entertain}} {{is evident in}} one of the most famous ones—Scheherazade—a story in the Persian professional storytelling tradition, of a woman who saves her own life by telling stories. The connections between the different types of entertainment are shown by the way that stories like this inspire a retelling in another medium, such as music, film or games. For example, composers Rimsky-Korsakov, Ravel and Szymanowski have each been inspired by the Scheherazade story and turned it into an orchestral work; director Pasolini made a film adaptation; and there is an innovative video game based on the tale. Stories may be told wordlessly, in music, dance or puppetry for example, such as in the Javanese tradition of wayang, in which the performance is accompanied by a <b>gamelan</b> orchestra or the similarly traditional Punch and Judy show.|$|E
5000|$|Although [...] "Fiol {{was known}} for her {{innovative}} transformation of unlikely spaces into performance spaces recognized for their warmth and great sound," [...] the Brooklyn neighborhood into which Fiol transplanted her avant-garde hipster culture has its own unvarnished quality. One reviewer described the experience of approaching the current facility:To get to the Issue Project Room, proceed past Carroll Street's red brick row houses and their wrought iron gratings, past the building marked NYC 2WAY INT.L, until you come, right before the canal, to a medieval-sized gate made of bent iron rods. Duck through the inset door (be careful not to slam it) and make your way through the dirt and grass lot, weaving through the bare winter trees and past the covered-up boat that lies plowed into the ground, as if deposited there by a flood. Look up and you'll see the circular turret of an abandoned oil silo rising high above the canal, concrete and round. Scale the slippery iron steps and look through the glass door: You might see a troupe of matronly women and gray men banging <b>gamelans</b> or bowing zithers; you might see a white man from Harlem with a long beard, a pink bandana, and a black hat hiding his eyes, on his knees, screaming; or you might see, because it's there to see most every night, a marginally well-heeled crowd of men and women, glasses predominate, eyes closed, often cross-legged on the carpet, slowly nodding in empathy at the spectacle before them.|$|R
40|$|Musical exoticism is the {{evocation}} {{of a culture}} {{different from that of}} the composer. It occurs anytime a composer tries to conjure up the music of a country not his own. Although there have been studies of exoticism in the piano works of an individual composer, namely Debussy, there has not been a comprehensive study of musical exoticism in the piano literature as a whole. Upon chronological examination of the piano repertoire, general trends exhibiting exoticism become evident. The first general trend is the emergence of the Turkish style (alia turca) in the eighteenth century. Turkish style soon transmuted to the Hungarian-Gypsy style (all 'ongarese or style hongrois). [In Beethoven's Op. 129, it is alia ingharese. ] Composers often alternated between the two styles even in the same composition. By the late nineteenth century, style hongrois was firmly entrenched in the musical language of Austro-German composers, as seen in the works of Brahms. In the nineteenth century, composers turned to the Middle East, North Africa and Spain for inspiration. In particular are several compositions emulating Spanish dance music, culminating in the Spanish works of Debussy and Ravel. The <b>gamelans</b> from Indonesia and objects from the Far East of Japan and China, brought by advances in trade and transportation, captivated the imagination of composers at the turn of the twentieth century. Also in the early twentieth century, composers tried emulating dance and jazz music coming from the Americas, such as the cakewalk, minstrelsy, and the blues. One sees the ever widening sphere of exotic inspiration for western music composers: from the Turkish invasions to the traveling Gypsies of Hungary; to the captivating dance rhythms, soulful cante jondo sections, and guitar flourishes of Spain; expanding further to the far reaches of Asia and the jazzy rhythms of the Americas. This performance dissertation consists of three recitals presented at the University of Maryland, and is documented on compact disc recordings which are housed within the University of Maryland Library System. The recordings present the music of Balakirev, Beethoven, Brahms, Chopin, Debussy, Haydn, Hummel, Milhaud, Moszkowski, Mozart, Ravel, and Schubert...|$|R
40|$|Unity in Diversity as Indonesian motto {{turns into}} a saying which unifies the nation. Indonesia proudly {{presents}} many islands, races, ethnic groups, cultures, and also traditional languages. This symbolizes multiculturalism that has survived in the motherland. Generally, an Indonesian applies traditional and Indonesian languages in daily life and learns English at school or course. Some have practiced other foreign languages such as Arabic as well since it becomes the language of Al-Qur’an. However, English is usually taught as the compulsory subject in every level of disciplines. English belongs to any states of the world. In learning Islam, human being needs to learn and use English. Most references of Islamic studies are written particularly in Arabic and globally in English. Dealing with this issue, a teacher, in this case an Islamic religion teacher as a figure who educates students, should learn Islamic terms in bilingual versions beside his/her own competence. The teacher {{is expected to have}} not only multi-skills but also multicultural education. Having diverse students from multiethnic society probably occurs. Afterward, multicultural education nowadays is being a part of the school curriculum and made a compulsory school subject. It offers the prospect for both the teacher and students to learn inclusion materials that contain fundamental principles, such as democracy, humanism, and pluralism or inclusive religious values. All of those principles could be handed in Islamic Education Material Development Based Multicultural in order to build an inclusive religion at school. The materials are as follows (Salamah, 2011) : First, the material of the Koran, in determining the choice of verses. Second, the jurisprudence material, can be extended to study fiqh siyasa (government). Third, the material character of the studies focus on the good-bad behavior against God, Apostle, fellow humans, ourselves, as well as the environment, critical to laying the foundations of nationhood. Lastly, SKI material, material that is rooted in historical fact and reality. Furthermore, a kind of TV program is also possibly to be a medium to introduce multicultural education to children. They as one of cartoon mania on TV, for instance, know how to enjoy watching their favorite cartoon series (Upin & Ipin) while unconsciously learning the multicultural education in their early ages. Otherwise, Darwis Dance (collaboration of a Turkish dance and Javanese <b>Gamelans)</b> grows to be one more alternative approach in learning Islam and multicultural education.

5|$|Unlike westernized instrumentation, {{there is}} no set tuning for kulintang sets {{throughout}} the Philippines. Great variation exist between each set {{due to differences in}} make, size and shape, alloy used giving each kulintang set a unique pitch level, intervals and timbre. Though the tuning varies greatly, there does exist some uniformity to contour when same melody heard on different kulintang sets. This common counter results in similar interval relationships of more or less equidistant steps between each of the gongs. This tuning system, not based upon equal temperament or upon a system of standard pitches but on a similar/certain pattern of large and small intervals, could also be found among the <b>gamelan</b> orchestras of western Indonesia. In fact, though the Maguindanao, Maranao and Tausug artists technically have no concept of scale (because emphasis placed on the concept of “rhythmic modes”), the Pelog and Slendro scales of Java were found to be most satisfactory to their own varying pentatonic/heptatonic scales.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gamelan</b> is {{also found}} outside Indonesia. There are forms of <b>gamelan</b> that have {{developed}} outside Indonesia, such as American <b>gamelan</b> in the United States and Malay <b>Gamelan</b> in Malaysia. <b>Gamelan</b> has also become quite widespread along the South East of Sri Lanka, particularly with the Tamil community, and in Colombo, at the Indonesian Embassy.|$|E
