25|$|The 1st Battalion 7th Marines, {{including}} Lee, {{landed at}} Inchon on September 21, 1950, {{to attack the}} North Koreans and force them to retreat northwards. The People's Republic of China sent troops to stiffen the North Korean fighting response. On the night of November 2–3 in the Sudong Gorge, Lee's unit was attacked by Chinese forces. Lee kept his men focused by directing them to shoot at the enemy's muzzle flashes. Following this, Lee single-handedly advanced upon the enemy front and attacked their positions one by one to draw their fire and reveal themselves. His men fired at the muzzle flashes and inflicted casualties, forcing the enemy to retreat. While advancing, Lee shouted to the enemy in Mandarin Chinese to sow confusion and then attacked with hand grenades and gunfire. Lee {{was wounded in the}} knee and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>light</b> was shot in the right elbow by a sniper, shattering the bones. He was evacuated to a MASH unit (an army field hospital) outside of Hamhung. For bravely attacking the enemy and saving his men, Lee was awarded the Navy Cross, the second highest honor given for combat bravery.|$|E
25|$|In their rooms, Raoul expresses disgust {{that their}} host would send circus freaks to receive them ("What a Dreadful Town!..."). He upsets Gustave {{by refusing to}} play with him and storms out to find a bar, leaving Christine to explain his {{behavior}} to their son ("Look With Your Heart"). When Gustave goes to bed, the Phantom enters and reveals to a stunned Christine that {{it was he who}} summoned her to sing at Phantasma. Initially outraged, Christine eventually succumbs to the memory of a clandestine evening the two shared before she was married. As they recall their one night of passion, it is revealed that Christine was prepared to abandon Raoul for the Phantom, but awoke in the morning to find herself alone. The Phantom explains that he fled out of fear that she would reject him again when she saw his face <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>light</b> ("Beneath a Moonless Sky"). Both concede that they once thought their love had a chance, but the circumstances of the present day make it impossible ("Once Upon Another Time"). They are startled by a scream from Gustave, who awakens from a nightmare and rushes into the room. Christine introduces the Phantom as an old friend named Mr. Y, and he promises to show the boy around Phantasma the next day ("Mother Please, I'm Scared!").|$|E
500|$|The {{decision}} {{to land at}} daybreak {{turned out to be}} a mistake, as the alarm was raised in Nassau when the three ships were spotted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>light,</b> rousing Browne from his bed. He ordered four guns fired from Fort Nassau to alert the militia; two of the guns came off their mounts when they were fired. At 7:00 a.m. he held a discussion with Samuel Gambier, one of his councilors, over the idea that the gunpowder should be removed from the islands on the Mississippi Packet, a fast ship docked in the harbor. They ultimately did not act on the idea, but Browne ordered thirty mostly unarmed militiamen to occupy Fort Montagu before retiring to his house to make himself [...] "a little decent".|$|E

500|$|On 30 October, General White {{ordered an}} attack on {{northern}} Boer positions. White's plans were described as vague, ambitious, and complicated, and the battle proved a disaster that became known to the British as [...] "Mournful Monday". The 1st King's were allocated to Colonel Grimwood's column, which intended to advance on and secure Long Hill, believed to constitute the Boer's left flank. Unbeknownst to Grimwood, {{almost half of the}} brigade separated from the column during the night march while following a rightward deviation by the artillery batteries, including the oblivious 1st King's and Royal Dublin Fusiliers. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>light,</b> the brigade discovered that its right flank was exposed by the distance of John French's cavalry and that Long Hill was unoccupied. Grimwood and French's men became pinned down by heavy rifle and artillery fire. Amidst rumours of an attack against the town being imminent and failure evident, White ordered the column to retreat at noon. The artillery provided cover during the chaos that followed and prevented greater loss of life. At Nicholson's Nek, to the north-west of Long Hill, the Boers took more than 1,000 prisoner.|$|E

She suspects him of plotting against the Doge {{and when he}} arrives she warns him {{of the dangers of}} political conspiracy. Word arrives that the Doge is coming. Amelia, fearing that the Doge will force her to marry Paolo, now his councilor, urges Adorno to ask her guardian Andrea (in reality, Fiesco) for permission for them to marry: Sì, sì dell'ara il giubilo / contrasti il fato avverso - [...] "Yes, let the joy of marriage be set against unkind fate".|$|E
2500|$|On April 19, 1775, {{the opening}} {{battle of the}} American Revolution {{occurred}} when the British forces raided inland from Boston to Concord [...] "to destroy a Magazine of Military Stores deposited there." [...] When the raid broke into a firefight, the [...] "Troops had above Fifty killed, and many more wounded". In the April 20, 1775, issue of the Massachusetts Gazette and Boston Weekly News Letter a short article appeared that briefly described the battle, and—a day or more later—a broadside was published that reported on the [...] at greater length. Both were quite likely written and printed by John Howe, {{who would have been}} just a few months short of his 21st birthday. After the Battle of Lexington and Concord news of the event quickly spread to the other colonies and American patriots came in great numbers to lay siege to Boston. On June 17, 1775, the American forces seized a hill across the Charles river to the north of Boston in [...] Charlestown and began building fortifications upon it from which {{they would be able to}} fire upon the town and harbour. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>light,</b> a British ship in the harbour, seeing the fortifications being constructed on the hill, began firing on the hill. Soon, British troops were ferried from Boston to Charlestown, where they charged up and took the hill, although at an enormous cost in lives. John Howe witnessed, wrote, and printed the broadside describing the [...] In later years, he described his experiences at the battle to his youngest son, Joseph, in which he watched as General Sir William Howe led the final bayonet charge up the hill [...] "with the bullets flying through the tails of his coat." [...] After the battle, John told of aiding [...] "a young officer whose leg had been amputated and who he cured of a raging fever by letting him drink a bucket of cold water." [...] Shortly after the battle, John Howe proposed to Martha Minns, who accepted and became his fiancée.|$|E
