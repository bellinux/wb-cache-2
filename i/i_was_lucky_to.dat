25|$|The {{dropping}} of McCosker angered Ian Chappell and {{his teammates}} and I copped the brunt of it. I {{may have been an}} unassuming guy at the time, but I was rudely awakened to the facts of life at test level – thanks, or rather no thanks to Chappell {{and the rest of the}} team. I was not exactly welcomed with open arms into the team. In fact, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>lucky</b> <b>to</b> discover my locker in the Australian dressing rooms. To top it off, Chappell figured that if I was selected to replace McCosker, that's exactly what I would do... at Number 3. I suppose you could say it was an honour to bat ahead of Ian and Greg Chappell in a test. But I have no doubts that certain members of that team wanted me to fail and therefore prove that the selectors had erred. Normally, a new batsman could expect to be cradled into the side and be 'hidden' down the order until he gets the feel of the test atmosphere. There was no such deal for me. I was thrown into the deep end, to sink or swim, and that will live in my memory forever. While I am captain of a team, no batsman will be given the shoddy treatment I received on my test debut.|$|E
500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and at a later press conference. Häkkinen was delighted with his victory: [...] "This was an incredible win. It {{was a very difficult}} and unusual situation including my spin which of course was not planned. The kerbs here are very slippery and once you go over one there is not much you can do. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>lucky</b> <b>to</b> keep going and I was able to chase Michael. But the car got better and better." [...] The driver added that he wanted to review his overtaking manoeuvre to see if Michael Schumacher performed an illegal move. Schumacher said that despite improvements to his car, he was unable to match Häkkinen's overall pace. He added that he experienced no problems running off-line to cool his tyres, and was happy to run behind backmarkers for straight-line speed assistance during the race's closing stages.|$|E

6000|$|Of {{our journey}} through Zululand {{there is nothing}} {{particular}} to say. We saw but few people, {{since most of the}} men had been called up to the army, and many of the kraals seemed to be deserted by the women and children who perhaps were hidden away with the cattle. Once, however, we met an impi about five thousand strong, that seemed to cover the hillside like a herd of game. It consisted of the Nodwengu and the Nokenke regiments, both of which afterwards fought at Isandhlwana. Some of their captains with a small guard came to see who we were, fine, fierce-looking men. They stared at me curiously, and with one of them, whom I knew, I had a little talk. He said that I was the last white man in Zululand and that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>lucky</b> <b>to</b> be alive, for soon these, and he pointed to the hordes of warriors who were streaming past, would eat up the English to [...] "the last bone." [...] I answered that this remained to be seen, as the English were also great eaters, whereat he laughed, replying, that it was true that the white men had already taken the first bite--a very little one, from which I gathered that some small engagement had happened.|$|E
