This published work earned him an award titled the American Association Prize and <b>five</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>dollars</b> from Burton E. Livingston of the Committee on Awards.|$|E
25|$|Immediately, {{under the}} act, the United States Attorney {{tried to bring}} leading church {{officials}} to trial. These efforts culminated in the sentencing of George Reynolds to two years hard labor in prison and a fine of <b>five</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>dollars</b> for his practice of polygamy. In 1876, the Utah Territorial Supreme Court upheld the sentence. His 1878 Reynolds v. United States appeal reached the United States Supreme Court, and in January 1879 that body ruled the anti-polygamy legislation constitutional and upheld Reynolds's prison sentence (it struck down the fine and hard labor portions). Reynolds {{was released from prison}} in January 1881, having served eighteen months of his original sentence.|$|E

During the first hour of his first weekend pass (unsupervised release) in 34 years, Krueger arranged to meet Dennis Kerr in the woods near Brockville where Krueger would loan Kerr <b>five</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>dollars.</b> When Dennis Kerr arrived as instructed, Krueger struck him in the head with the pipe wrench and continued to beat him into unconsciousness. Krueger and Hamill then seized the hatchet and knife they had hidden in the bushes while waiting for Kerr's arrival and hacked and stabbed Kerr, mutilating his body, cutting it open, and nearly severing his head. Drenched in Kerr's blood, they then stripped themselves naked and sodomized the corpse. Krueger then left the scene, walked to a police station about two miles away, and turned himself in.|$|E
25|$|The LDS Church, {{believing that}} the law unconstitutionally {{deprived}} its members of their First Amendment right to freely practice their religion, chose to ignore the Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act at the time. On the other hand, in subsequent years, efforts had been underway to strengthen the anti-bigamy laws. Eventually, amid the efforts to indict the LDS leadership for bigamy, the First Presidency agreed to furnish a defendant in a test case to be brought before the United States Supreme Court to determine {{the constitutionality of the}} anti-bigamy law. Reynolds, a secretary {{in the office of the}} president of the church, agreed to serve as the defendant, then provided the United States Attorney with numerous witnesses who could testify of his being married to two wives, and was indicted for bigamy by a grand jury on October 23, 1874. In 1875, Reynolds was convicted and sentenced to two years hard labor in prison and a fine of <b>five</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>dollars.</b> In 1876 the Utah Territorial Supreme Court upheld the sentence.|$|E
