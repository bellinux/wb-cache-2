25|$|In {{the cities}} of Hubli, Belgaum and Gulbarga {{in the state of}} Karnataka, the private {{operator}} Veolia increased water supply from once every 2–15days for 1–2hours, to 24hours per day for 180,000 people (12% {{of the population of the}} 3 cities) within 2years (2006–2008). This was achieved by carefully selecting and ring-fencing demonstration zones (one in each city), renovating the distribution network, installing meters, introducing a well-functioning commercial system, and effective grass-roots social <b>intermediation</b> by an NGO, all without increasing the amount of bulk water supplied. The project, known by its acronym as KUWASIP (Karnataka Urban Water Sector Improvement Project), was supported by a 39.5million loan from the World Bank. It constitutes a milestone for India, where no large city so far has achieved continuous water supply. The project is expected to be scaled-up to cover the entire area of the three cities.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{types of}} gold [...] "{{accounts}}" [...] are available. Different accounts impose varying types of <b>intermediation</b> between {{the client and}} their gold. One {{of the most important}} differences between accounts is whether the gold is held on an allocated (fully reserved) or unallocated (pooled) basis. Unallocated gold accounts are a form of fractional reserve banking and do not guarantee an equal exchange for metal {{in the event of a}} run on the issuer's gold on deposit. Another major difference is the strength of the account holder's claim on the gold, in the event that the account administrator faces gold-denominated liabilities (due to a short or naked short position in gold for example), asset forfeiture, or bankruptcy.|$|E

2500|$|The FairTax {{would be}} tax free on {{mortgage}} interest {{up to the}} basic interest rate {{as determined by the}} Federal Reserve. The interest above the basic rate applied by the lender is a financial <b>intermediation</b> service and is subject to the FairTax (on a typical home mortgage only about one-half of one percent of interest would be subject to tax). Several economic studies have estimated that switching from an income tax system to a consumption tax system such as the FairTax would result in an interest rate drop of approximately 25%. These changes would result in a decreased cost for home buyers. [...] As a comparison to the FairTax for encouraging home ownership, the current tax system would have to allow all taxpayers to fully deduct the purchase of used property against income and payroll taxes, expand the mortgage interest deduction so that it permits a deduction against payroll taxes, fully untax interest income to lenders and institutions, and fully untax returns on savings. [...] However, since several areas would be tax free under the FairTax plan, it could decrease the social incentive to spend more on homes in favor of savings, education, or other investments.|$|E

[...] Acteal is divided into three distinct areas, one dominated by the Zapatistas, one by the PRI, and one by Las Abejas. [...] The area affiliated with the PRI, whose residents also tend to be affiliated with the Presbyterian Church in this area, is also known as Acteal Alto (Higher Acteal). [...] The area dominated by the Zapatistas, which they consider to be an autonomous community, is known as Acteal Bajo, or Lower Acteal. [...] Members of Las Abejas occupy a third area of Acteal, in between the other two; the organization [...] "has identified this geographic position as a reflection of their mission of <b>intermediation</b> and identity as nonviolent peacemakers." [...] Although the commitment to pacifism of Las Abejas firmly distinguished them from the Zapatistas, those affiliated with the PRI in Higher Acteal suspected Las Abejas of being allied with the Zapatistas. [...] The EZLN, conversely, suspected that they may be allied with the PRI-istas. [...] As a result, Las Abejas [...] "were pressured and harassed from both Zapatista and Priista sides." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2004 it was {{discovered}} that Portas's CDS-PP party had deposited 1,065,250 euros through 105 low-denomination deposits into the party's accounts in an attempt to circumvent monitoring regulations on political party funding and possibly on money-laundering (see smurfing). It was factually established that CDS-PP fabricated the donor receipts (including some using comical names such as [...] "Jacinto Leite Capelo Rego," [...] which in Portuguese is an erotic pun on words) but the real source of the money was never identified. In investigating, the police suspected the Espírito Santo Group (on whose bank the money was deposited) to have donated that money in connection with a tourism development named 'Portucale' in Benavente that entailed the cutting down of thousands of protected cork trees, which Paulo Portas, through his (until then) best friend and party colleague Luís Nobre Guedes, allegedly facilitated {{in the final days of}} the government to which they belonged. Paulo Portas denied any illegality and was not directly implicated in the case, while Nobre Guedes took the blame (and stopped talking to Paulo Portas). However, in investigating this case, the police intercepted phone calls that motivated another investigation into the costly purchase of two submarines by the Portuguese State (see below). It turned out that in addition to the Espírito Santo Group's real estate subsidiary in charge of the Portucale project (ESAF) there was another trading subsidiary (ESCOM) that was also an intermediary in a major submarines deal, for which it had received 30 million euros in advance and which was judicially suspected to have been the source of the CDS-PP deposits as a kickback pay-off for the submarines <b>intermediation.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... 1295. Thus {{induction}} {{appears to}} be essentially an action of contiguous particles, through the <b>intermediation</b> of which the electric force, originating or appearing at a certain place, is propagated to or sustained at a distance, appearing there as a force {{of the same kind}} exactly equal in amount, but opposite in its direction and tendencies (1164.). Induction requires no sensible thickness in the conductors which may be used to limit its extent; an uninsulated leaf of gold may be made very highly positive on one surface, and as highly negative on the other, without the least interference of the two states whilst the inductions continue. Nor is it affected {{by the nature of the}} limiting conductors, provided time be allowed, in the case of those which conduct slowly, for them to assume their final state (1170.).|$|E
6000|$|According to Descartes, then, all the {{functions}} which {{are common to}} man and animals are performed by the body as a mere mechanism, and he looks upon consciousness as the peculiar distinction of the [...] "chose pensante," [...] of the [...] "rational soul," [...] which in man (and in man only, in Descartes' opinion) is superadded to the body. This rational soul he conceived to be lodged in the pineal gland, as {{in a sort of}} central office; and, here, by the <b>intermediation</b> of the animal spirits, it became aware {{of what was going on}} in the body, or influenced the operations of the body. Modern physiologists do not ascribe so exalted a function to the little pineal gland, but, in a vague sort of way, they adopt Descartes' principle, and suppose that the soul is lodged in the cortical part of the brain--at least this is commonly regarded as the seat and instrument of consciousness.|$|E
60|$|In {{physics and}} chemistry, the old {{boundaries}} of which sciences are rapidly becoming effaced, one can hardly go wrong in ascribing a primary {{value to the}} investigations into {{the relation between the}} solid, liquid, and gaseous states of matter on the one hand, and degrees of pressure and of heat on the other. Almost all, even the most refractory, solids have been vaporised by the intense heat of the electric arc; and the most refractory gases have been forced to assume the liquid, and even the solid, forms by the combination of high pressure with intense cold. It has further been shown that there is no discontinuity between these states--that a gas passes into the liquid state through a condition which is neither one nor the other, and that a liquid body becomes solid, or a solid liquid, by the <b>intermediation</b> of a condition in which it is neither truly solid nor truly liquid.|$|E

With respect to the causes of variation, Darwin's opinions are, from first to last, put forward altogether tentatively. In the first edition of the [...] "Origin," [...] he attributes the strongest influence to changes in the conditions of life of parental organisms, which he appears to think act on the germ through the <b>intermediation</b> of the sexual organs. He points out, over and over again, that habit, use, disuse, and the direct influence of conditions have some effect, but he does not think it great, and he draws attention to the difficulty of distinguishing between effects of these agencies and those of selection. There is, however, one class of variations which he withdraws from the direct influence of selection, namely, the variations in the fertility of the sexual union of more or less closely allied forms. He regards less fertility, or more or less complete sterility, as [...] "incidental to other acquired differences." [...] (Ibid., p. 245.) ...|$|E

The hollow of the hemisphere on either side communicates with the third ventricle, the original cavity of the fore-brain (1 in Figure 5), by an aperture (the foramen of Monro), indicated by a black arrow (f.M.). Besides their original communication through the <b>intermediation</b> of the fore-brain, the hemispheres are also united above its roof by a broad bridge of fibre, the corpus callosum (c.c.), which is distinctive of the mammalian animals. The original fore-brain vesicle has its lateral walls thickened to form the optic thalami (o.th.), between which a middle commissure, (m.c.), absent in lower types, stretches like a great beam across the third ventricle. The original fore-brain is often called the thalamencephalon, the hemisphere, the prosencephalon, the olfactory lobes, the rhinencephalon.|$|E
