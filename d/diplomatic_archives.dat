500|$|Owen's later {{views on}} {{international}} affairs did not escape controversy. [...] Though initially a firm {{supporter of the}} Treaty of Versailles, including its assertion of German responsibility for the outbreak of [...] World War I, during 1923 his views changed radically {{under the influence of}} [...] "revisionist" [...] studies, including the publication of extensive (though incomplete) materials from the <b>diplomatic</b> <b>archives</b> of the pre-War Tsarist Russian Foreign Office. [...] He made a major speech in the Senate on 18 December 1923 attributing primary responsibility for the war to France and (especially) Russia rather than Germany. [...] Owen hoped that a public revisiting of the issue of war guilt might encourage reversal of some of the penal clauses imposed on Germany under the Versailles settlement, and pave the way to reconciliation between Germany and France, but his attempts to promote a Senate investigation of the war guilt question were narrowly defeated, largely along party lines — with many of his fellow Democrats concerned not to undermine the reputation of Woodrow Wilson — while an expert report prepared by the Legislative Research Service of the Library of Congress, though broadly supportive of Owen's arguments, was in the event never published as it was considered unlikely to obtain the support of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. [...] In 1926, following his retirement from the Senate, Owen was to publish a book advancing his revisionist thesis, under the title: The Russian Imperial Conspiracy, 1892-1914: The Most Gigantic Intrigue of all Time.|$|E

2500|$|As {{early as}} June 1956, Muench tasked his secretary, Father Gerard Weber, with {{the talk of}} sending his files, mostly {{composed}} of his personal correspondences, back to Fargo; Muench further directed four German nuns of the Saint Lioba convent in Freiburg/Breisgau to organize his German language correspondence.

2500|$|In his 2002 book The Real Odessa Uki Goñi {{showed that}} Argentine diplomats and {{intelligence}} officers had, on Perón's instructions, vigorously encouraged Nazi and Fascist war criminals {{to make their}} home in Argentina. Argentina's first move into Nazi smuggling was in January 1946, when Caggiano flew with Bishop Agustín Barrére to Rome where Caggiano was due to be created cardinal. While in Rome, the Argentine bishops met with French Cardinal Eugène Tisserant, where they passed on a message (recorded in Argentina's <b>diplomatic</b> <b>archives)</b> that [...] "the Government of the Argentine Republic was willing to receive French persons, whose political attitude during the recent war would expose them, should they return to France, to harsh measures and private revenge". Over the spring of 1946 a number of French war criminals, fascists and Vichy officials made it from Italy to Argentina in the same way: they were issued passports by the Rome ICRC office; these were then stamped with Argentine tourist visas (the need for health certificates and return tickets was waived on Caggiano's recommendation). The first documented case of a French war criminal arriving in Buenos Aires was Emile Dewoitine, who was later sentenced in absentia to 20 years hard labour. He sailed first class on the same ship back with Cardinal Caggiano.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to present and analyse {{relations}} between the French authorities and representatives of the domestic authorities of the Republic of Poland in the years immediately after the end of the Second World War. The sources are predominantly archival material at the <b>Diplomatic</b> <b>Archive</b> Center of the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs in La Courneuve and the Polish Library in Paris. Initially, the French authorities maintained a distance vis-à-vis the Polish Committee for National Liberation (PKWN). Ultimately, the question of dispatching to Poland a French envoy to gather information about the situation of French citizens intending to repatriate, created conducive conditions for the efforts made by the authorities of People’s Poland connected with the reception of a PKWN delegate in France. At the end of December 1944, the PKWN appointed its official delegate to the French Government. At the end of June 1945, France recognised the Provisional Government of National Unity, established in Warsaw, thus withdrawing its acknowledgment of the émigré government of the Republic of Poland in London. A mass-scale repatriation of Poles living in France to the country of their origin was the most significant organisational task of the diplomatic and consular outposts of the Warsaw government. At the same time, the government in Warsaw and its outposts in France ceased supporting Polish refugees, who did not wish to return home and who refused to recognise the Warsaw authorities. Another key issue facing the outposts of People’s Poland was the Polish school system in France. In 1944 - 1948 France was perceived by People’s Poland as the “best friend” in West Europe. The first symptoms of a crisis became noticeable in the last quarter of 1947, when Polish-French relations entered a new phase of open hostility, coinciding with the years 1948 - 1949. The change in French policy towards Poland, initiated in the autumn of 1947, stemmed from reflections claiming that Poland’s efforts towards maintaining good relations with France in order to reduce the risk of rebuilding German might, led basically to supporting Soviet policy in Europe and a conflict between France and the Anglo-Saxon powers...|$|R

Within an analytical framework, which includes economic factors, internal circumstances, the international environment, perception of decision makers as well as bureaucratic factors the author tries to reveal reasons for German foreign policy, which caused the break off and what led seven years later to the resumption. The research revealed that the time for establishing diplomatic relationship with Israel, which led automatically into the break off with the Arab States was mainly influenced by the Unites States. Contrary to the literature published, that lack of flexibility of the Hallstein-Doktrin led to the break off of the <b>diplomatic</b> relationship, the <b>archive</b> research revealed that lack of a flexible Hallstein-Doktrin was not the reason for the break off and even prevented Egypt, until 1969, from establishing diplomatic relationships with East Germany...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{doctoral}} dissertation is to exhibit the field of health of the Greeks of Venice from their diachronic history in that city. Research of original materials was conducted in Archives of the Greek Institute of Venice, Government Archives of Venice (G. A. V.), Archives of churches of Venice, St. Severo, St. Zaccaria, St. Giovanni in Bragora, Sa. Ternita, Sa. Giustina, St. Francesco della Vigna, St. Martino, in Archivio della Fondazione di S. Servolo, {{as well as at the}} <b>Diplomatic</b> Historical <b>Archives</b> of the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It tells of the creation and operation of Flangini Hospital which had three operational periods: the First (1666 - 1797), the Transitional (1797 - 1845) and the Second (1845 - 1905). Subjects of this work are the First and the Transitional periods when the hospital had the name of its founder and sponsor, Thomas Flangini. For the Second Period (1845 - 1905), when the hospital is named Flangini- Pikering Hospital, a relative work is being prepared. The equipment, doctors, nurses and administrators of Flangini Hospital are documented, while the manner of obtaining and distributing medicines and the issuance of post-hospital subsidies with patients' release from the hospital is described. Political developments in Venice at the end of the 18 th century are analyzed as are their repercussions as regards operation of Flangini Hospital. Also made known is the wider framework of Venice with a description of its four major hospitals: della Pieta, degl' Incurabili, dei Derelitti and dei Mendicanti, as well as their relationship with Flangini Hospital. Whereas Venice, from 16 / 5 / 1797, with the entrance of Napoleon's troops into the city, is rendered into a state of occupation, the efforts of the Greek Community to save the hospital and its basic operation in spite of obstacles is dealt with. Extortion of funds donated by Flangini for operation of the hospital by the occupiers will cause it to be turned into a Shelter for the Poor on 4 / 3 / 1808 and it will operate in this capacity for the remainder of its Transitional Period until 5 / 12 / 1845. Doctors, Greek and foreign, who treated Greek patients at Flangini Hospital, at the Shelter for the Poor, the Public Hospital of Venice or with house calls, are documented, whereas matters dealing with wider health issues and pertaining to the Greek Community during its Transitional Period (1797 - 1845) are also noted. ...|$|R
