5|$|DST is {{generally}} not observed near the equator, where sunrise times do not vary enough to justify it. Some countries observe it only in some regions; for example, southern Brazil observes <b>it</b> <b>while</b> equatorial Brazil does not. Only {{a minority of the}} world's population uses DST because Asia and Africa generally do not observe it.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, the {{documentary}} Life Itself was released. Director Steve James, whose films had been widely advocated by Ebert, started making <b>it</b> <b>while</b> the critic was still alive.

5|$|In a paper {{published}} in 2009, {{researchers found that}} mockingbirds were able to recall an individual human who, earlier in the study, had approached and threatened the mockingbirds' nest. Researchers had one participant stand near a mockingbird nest and touch <b>it,</b> <b>while</b> others avoided the nest. Later, the mockingbirds recognized the intruder and exhibited defensive behavior, while ignoring the other individuals.|$|E

5|$|Pacino found acting enjoyable and {{realized}} he had a gift for <b>it</b> <b>while</b> studying at The Actors Studio. However, his early work was not financially rewarding. After his success on stage, Pacino made his film debut in 1969 with a brief appearance in Me, Natalie, an independent film starring Patty Duke. In 1970, Pacino signed with the talent agency Creative Management Associates (CMA).|$|E

5|$|Until {{the late}} 1970s, {{there were no}} federal laws {{specifically}} addressing the production, distribution or possession of child pornography, and it was readily available to those who sought <b>it.</b> <b>While</b> most was imported from European countries where it was legally produced in large quantities {{there was also a}} domestic industry.|$|E
5|$|A second {{strategy}} was therefore suggested to the Allies by Themistocles. The route to southern Greece (Boeotia, Attica and the Peloponnesus) {{would require the}} army of Xerxes to travel through the very narrow pass of Thermopylae. This could easily be blocked by the Allies, despite the overwhelming number of Persians. Furthermore, to prevent the Persians bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the allied navy could block the straits of Artemisium. This dual {{strategy was}} adopted by the congress. However, the Peloponnesian cities made fall-back plans to defend the Isthmus of Corinth should it come to <b>it,</b> <b>while</b> the women and children of Athens were evacuated en masse to the Peloponnesian city of Troezen.|$|E

5|$|After {{learning}} more about Devarakota and Sashi's tyranny, Harsha announces that he will adopt the village and develop <b>it.</b> <b>While</b> he works to improve conditions in the village, Ratnam asks Sashi also to develop the village, partly {{to win in the}} upcoming elections, but he remains silent regarding his intention to gain credit for doing so. At the same time, Harsha comes to know from Rao that, as a young man, Ravikanth, wishing, as Harsha does now, to see the village developed, established a dairy farm for the locals' welfare. After the farm was set up, Ratnam and Sashi set it on fire, causing the death of many, and Ravikanth was blamed for the fire, insulted, and arrested. He walked out of the village, moved to the city, and went on to acquire much wealth.|$|E
5|$|Al-Kilabi led {{his army}} along the Jaxartes valley to Ferghana, and laid siege to <b>it</b> <b>while</b> devastating the {{surrounding}} countryside. At this point, the Umayyad army {{became aware that}} the Turgesh khagan Suluk was advancing against them with an army stronger than their own. Abandoning the siege, the Muslim army retreated so hastily towards the south that it was claimed they covered a distance in one day that equalled three days of normal travel. On the second day, after the Arabs crossed the river Wadi al-Subuh, the Turgesh army caught up with them, and attacked a secondary camp pitched by Abdallah ibn Abi Abdallah separately from the main Arab force. The Arabs and their Sogdian allies suffered heavy casualties—the brother of the ruler of Samarkand, Ghurak, being among the slain—but managed to repel the attack.|$|E

With the exception of pigeons {{and a few other}} species, most birds blink only with their nictitating membrane, and when not sleeping, use the eyelids chiefly only when the eye is threatened with some foreign matter.|$|E

She travels throughout the city and the Italian countryside, while picking up men from the roadside and having a party on the car. The video received general acclaim from critics, who commended the simplicity of the video and labeled it as Madonna's most fun video in years. The song was included on the setlist of The MDNA Tour where she performed <b>it</b> <b>while</b> playing a guitar.|$|E
5|$|Another legend {{tells of}} the digging of the church into the ground after the Ottoman conquest of Bulgaria (14th–15th centuries), so that the Ottomans would not desecrate it. According to that story, the church was buried and {{forgotten}} about by the villagers until the mid-19th century, when a local coincidentally rediscovered <b>it</b> <b>while</b> tying his donkey to a nearby cherry tree. A different version places the cherry tree {{on top of the}} hill under which the church stood. Reportedly, that cherry tree was struck by a thunderbolt, which enabled the villagers to reach the buried gate through the now-hollow trunk. The church was reconsecrated soon thereafter and dedicated to the 4th-century military saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki.|$|E

5|$|Because Iguanodon {{is one of}} {{the first}} dinosaur genera to have been named, {{numerous}} species have been assigned to <b>it.</b> <b>While</b> never becoming the wastebasket taxon several other early genera of dinosaurs (such as Megalosaurus) became, Iguanodon has had a complicated history, and its taxonomy continues to undergo revisions. Although Gregory Paul recommended restricting I. bernissartensis to the famous sample from Bernissart, ornithopod workers like Norman and McDonald have disagreed with Paul's recommendations, except exercising caution when accepting records of Iguanodon from France and Spain as valid.|$|E
5|$|Berkeley House on Piccadilly {{was named}} after John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton who had {{purchased}} its land, and that surrounding it, shortly after the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660. In 1696, the Berkeley family sold the house and grounds to the 1st Duke of Devonshire (who renamed it Devonshire House) on the proviso that {{the view from the}} rear of the house should not be spoiled. Berkeley Square was laid out to the rear of the house in the 1730s; because of the conditions of sale, houses were only built on the east and west sides of it. The west side still has various mid-18th century buildings along <b>it,</b> <b>while</b> the east side now contains offices including Berkeley Square House.|$|E
5|$|Berkman {{planned to}} write a book about his {{experience}} in Russia, but he postponed <b>it</b> <b>while</b> he assisted Goldman as she wrote a similar book, using as sources material he had collected.

Berkman worked on his book, The Bolshevik Myth, throughout 1923 and it was published in January 1925.|$|E
