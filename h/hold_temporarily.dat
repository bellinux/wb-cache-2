In July 2004, Keenan performed at Serj Tankian's [...] (System of a Down) and Tom Morello's (Rage Against the Machine) Axis of Justice concert - an event for musicians to advocate for political and social causes. At the performance, Keenan announced that A Perfect Circle would be releasing a collection of political cover songs. During the beginning of the touring cycle for Thirteenth Step, Howerdel and Keenan discussed potential ideas for a third studio album. An early idea was to record an album of cover songs, though they were initially hesitant, feeling they needed a meaningful reason to warrant doing it. Keenan, who had been very critical of President George W. Bush during the touring cycle, proposed tying the concept together as a political-themed covers album, with Howerdel, while generally apolitical publicly, felt was worth pursuing in their post-September 11th attacks political and social climate. The two put their plans on <b>hold</b> <b>temporarily</b> and decided to move forward on the project as the band's third studio album. Keenan emphasized that, despite his personal feelings on Bush, the album was less of an [...] "anti-Bush" [...] album, and more of a [...] "anti-political apathy" [...] - encouraging people to research things and become more involved.|$|E

[...] Jessie Blackenburg Renyolds also remembered Louisa, commenting that [...] "Willie just couldn't hold onto money, for he was a grand spender, and she has to fix it so he couldn't mortgage everything." [...] When Kit Carson died in 1868, that was believed to have been the final straw for Cody, who was wanting to spend his money and gain the affections of any woman but his wife. Cody filed two divorce petitions, with one newspaper claiming that the cause behind them was Louisa's [...] "nagging." [...] The first filing of divorce was withdrawn due to the death of Orra Cody in 1883. The second went to trial in Cheyenne, Wyoming, in 1905, flooding headlines and tearing communities into the crossfire and demanding they pick sides.While the divorce scandal raged on between the two in the courtroom and in the papers, Louisa continued to maintain the house and her living children. When asked to put the suit on <b>hold</b> <b>temporarily</b> in order to attend the funeral of Arta, Louisa refused, demanding that she remain married and the suit be dropped.

Louisa and Cody reconciled in 1910 and she often attended his Wild West Shows until his death in 1917. Louisa died in 1921.|$|E
