25|$|The boatmen (usually {{with their}} families) were a rough {{independent}} lot, forming a class within themselves, and intermarrying {{within their own}} group. They frequently fought amongst each other for any reason, be it racial slurs (real or perceived), precedence at a lock, or for exercise. They fought with lockkeepers over company rules, or even with the company for changes in toll rates. During winter when the boats were tied up, they often lived <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>communities</b> away from others. One boat captain observed that on the canal, {{women and children were}} as good as the men, and if weren't for the children, the canal wouldn't run one day.|$|E
25|$|These women covered {{topics such}} as their lives before the uprising, what had changed since, and how women {{have participated in the}} EZLN. Also, the Zapatista women talked about the terrible {{conditions}} that women suffered which the Zapatistas sought to fix, including: the mistreatment from working for landowners, violence at home, discrimination faced <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>communities,</b> and lack of access to health care and education. Then, the women went on to discuss how the Zapatista movement changed their lives such as decreasing domestic violence, more freedom in regards to marriage and children, and more rights in general. One way that women achieved these changes is through the women’s collectives which allowed the women to be more independent which led to increased participation in the Zapatista movement.|$|E
25|$|Jews from Upper Nazareth, {{including}} apparently many Russian-speakers, attacked Arabs {{and their}} homes and businesses in Nazareth {{on the eve of}} Yom Kippur. Police, informed of the intention to attack Arabs, beefed up their forces and deployed them on the seam line between the two communities. When hundreds of Jewish youths from Nazareth Illit came down to throw stones and vandalize Arab properties, however, the police did not impede them. The Arab residents emerged from their homes to defend them, and reciprocal stone throwing clashes ensued. Police dispersed the riots with tear gas and live ammunition. Two Arabs who had attempted to rein <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>communities</b> from getting near the Jewish youths and police, Omar Akawi and Wissam Yazbek, were shot dead, the latter by a gunshot wound to the head, fired by a policeman from behind him.

500|$|After {{her visit}} to the queen, Trimmer was {{inspired}} to write The Œconomy of Charity, which describes how readers, specifically women, can establish Sunday schools <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>communities.</b> However, her book accomplished much more than this. While proponents of Sunday schools such as Raikes and Trimmer claimed that the schools would help control the growing social unrest of the poor, critics claimed that these schools would only encourage the social upheaval {{they were trying to}} quell. The Hon. John Byng, for example, issued the dire warning that [...] "not only would education 'teach them to read seditious pamphlets, books and publications against Christianity'… but it would render them unfit for 'the laborious employment to which their rank in society had destined them'". Trimmer agreed that the poor were [...] "destined" [...] by God to be poor but would argue that her schools reinforced that divine social hierarchy. The Sunday school debate was waged in churches, in Parliament and in print; in publishing The Œconomy of Charity, Trimmer was entering this vigorous debate.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, {{as many of}} the actual {{participants}} had grown older, moved on to other issues or died, this led to misunderstandings as to who had actually participated in the Stonewall riots, who had actually organized the subsequent demonstrations, marches and memorials, and who had been members of early activist organizations such as Gay Liberation Front and Gay Activists Alliance. The language has become more accurate and inclusive, though these changes met with initial resistance from some <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>communities</b> who were unaware of the historical events.

Despite this relationship with live music, recorded music, DJed by dancers, {{is the most popular}} musical medium for lindy hoppers today. DJing itself has assumed great significance in lindy hop culture, with dancers and DJs alike hotly debating which types of music should be played, and when. The SwingDJs discussion board [...] is a clear example of an online community within the lindy hop community which has developed solely around the playing of music for dancing lindy hop.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, the Ford Foundation and Rockefeller Foundation began {{contributing}} {{large amounts of}} money to the Council.

2500|$|As the Civil War began, the Bermuda Hundreds and {{surrounding}} countryside had mostly receded into a gracious backwater.

Several country estates yet remained which had grown into the large plantation houses which continued to dominate the surrounding country life. A number of independent farmers, fresh with prosperity derived from supporting local consumption gained additional income with smaller production of cash crops. Smaller part-time farmers, overseers, and tenant farmers lived in the countryside as well, holding smaller but well built colonial brick homes. Other Virginians, employed as part-time laborers on the farms and plantations and in the larger towns also lived <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>communities</b> in the countryside or town, while the large black population lived a restricted life on the plantations themselves.|$|E

2500|$|Otherwise, in Rome and {{throughout}} Italy, as at her ancient sanctuaries of Henna and Catena, Ceres' ritus graecus and her joint cult with Proserpina were invariably led by female sacerdotes, drawn from local and Roman elites: Cicero notes {{that once the}} new cult had been founded, its earliest priestesses [...] "generally were either from Naples or Velia", cities allied or federated to Rome. Elsewhere, he describes Ceres' Sicilian priestesses as [...] "older women respected for their noble birth and character". Celibacy {{may have been a}} condition of their office; sexual abstinence was, according to Ovid, required of those attending Ceres' major, nine-day festival. Her public priesthood was reserved to respectable matrons, be they married, divorced or widowed. The process of their selection and their relationship to Ceres' older, entirely male priesthood is unknown; but they far outnumbered her few male priests, and would have been highly respected and influential figures <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>communities.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{beginnings}} of Jewish history in Iran dates from late Biblical times. The biblical books of Isaiah, Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah, Chronicles, and Esther contain {{references to the}} life and experiences of Jews in Persia. In the book of Ezra, the Persian king Cyrus the Great is credited with permitting and enabling the Jews to return to Jerusalem and rebuild their Temple; its reconstruction was carried out [...] "according to the decree of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia" [...] (Ezra 6:14). This {{is said to have}} taken place in the late sixth century BC, by which time there was a well-established and influential Jewish community in Persia. Persian Jews have lived in the territories of today's Iran for over 2,700 years, since the first Jewish diaspora when Shalmaneser V conquered the (Northern) Kingdom of Israel (722 BC) and sent the Israelites into captivity at Khorasan. In 586 BC, the Babylonians expelled large populations of Jews from Judea to the Babylonian captivity. Jews who migrated to ancient Persia mostly lived <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>communities.</b>|$|E
2500|$|By {{the early}} 19th century, maroons (free blacks and runaway slaves) and the Seminole were in regular contact in Florida, where they evolved {{a system of}} {{relations}} unique among North American Native Americans and blacks. Seminole practice in Florida had acknowledged slavery, though not on the chattel slavery model then common in the American south. It was, in fact, more like feudal dependency since slaves of the Seminole generally lived <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> <b>communities,</b> In exchange for paying an annual tribute of livestock and crops and hunting and war party obligations, black prisoners or slaves found sanctuary among the Seminole. Seminoles, in turn, acquired an important strategic ally in a sparsely populated region. They elected their own leaders, and could amass wealth in cattle and crops. Most importantly, they bore arms for self-defense. Florida real estate records show that the Seminole and Black Seminole people owned large quantities of Florida land. In some cases, a portion of that Florida land is still owned by the Seminole and Black Seminole descendants in Florida. In the 19th century, the Black Seminoles were called [...] "Seminole Negroes" [...] by their white American enemies and Estelusti (Black People), by their Indian allies.|$|E
