30|$|Following {{the initial}} {{discovery}} {{of the effect of}} auxin-BR crosstalk on lamina <b>joint</b> <b>bending,</b> several genes have now been reported to be involved (Luo et al. 2016). For instance, LPA 1 negatively regulates lamina <b>joint</b> <b>bending</b> by inhibiting BR signaling and increasing the expression of auxin transporters (Liu et al. 2016). In a recent study, the SMOS 1 -SMOS 2 /DLT complex positively regulated expression of OsPHI- 1, and treatment of smos mutants with auxin and BR still showed a synergistic effect on lamina <b>joint</b> <b>bending</b> (Hirano et al. 2017). In the current study, we showed that DS 1 -OsARF 11 is invoved in auxin-BR crosstalk in rice. It is plausible that lamina <b>joint</b> <b>bending</b> is determined by a transcriptional network consisting of DS 1 -OsARF 11, SMOS 1 -SMOS 2 /DLT, LPA 1, and other factors regulated by auxin and BR signaling.|$|R

40|$|The {{possibilities}} {{offered by}} variable resistance bend sensors, applied as wearable devices on body garments, to recover human <b>joint</b> <b>bend</b> angles for body segment movement tracking, have been investigated, underlying their advantages and drawbacks in real-time applications. Due to their pliability, sensitivity, and cheapness, {{they could be}} a valid alternative to movement analysis systems, based on optoelectronic devices or inertial electronic sensors. This paper suggests a new method for sensor characterization under fast bend and extension movements, to extract few parameters of a synthetic model, which provide to the users the chance to foresee their electrical performance in different applications. The sensor and their extracted models were applied to register the human knee rotation during a gait cycle, either at slow speed (83 deg/s) for a walking pattern at 5 km/h, and at high speed (650 deg/s) for a running pattern of a sprinter at 10 m/s, and finally the finger joint rotations at their maximum angular velocity (900 deg/s). This was done for a twofold purpose: from one hand, to assess the model capability to predict the sensor performance, tracking human body segment rotations at different speed, without the need of measurement; from the other hand, to recover in real time the actual sensor rotation from its resistance measurement, especially in high speed applications, where its response is distorted. With this technique, the mean error decreases from 22. 5 ° to 3. 7 ° in the worst cas...|$|E

Here, an SMA-made actuator can offer the resistance needed for a rehabilitation program. A Ti-Ni based SMA is adopted for the body <b>joint</b> <b>bending</b> actuator. To facilitate the swinging angle and the related bending torque, various structures of the SMA-made body <b>joint</b> <b>bending</b> actuators (a one-bunch SMA actuator and a six-bunch SMA actuator) have been adjusted in the experimental work by varying the number of SMA fibers in a bounded bunch. Results reveal that the structure-A (a six-bunch SMA fiber with 8 fibers per bunch) and the structure-B (a one-bunch SMA actuator with 50 fibers per bunch) have similar functions- the bending angle is 158 ° and the maximum bending torque is 0. 155 Nm. Moreover, depending on the patient’s condition, both the maximum swinging angle and the velocity are adjustable by the patient via the PC-based control system. In addition, to avoid damage to the actuator, a maximum operating temperature of 90 °C is preset on the SMA...|$|R

30|$|In {{the case}} of two {{curvature}} axes for up/down and right/left motions using a flexible <b>bending</b> <b>joint</b> and wire drive mechanism, the up/down and right/left bending motions are decoupled from each other because the wires are routed on a plane passing through the bending center of the other axes. Furthermore, the power transmission parts of the gripper axis are routed along the central axis of the forceps shaft. Then, the gripper axis is decoupled from the up/down and right/left axes. The flexible <b>bending</b> <b>joint</b> and wire drive mechanisms are very simple.

50|$|The {{ankle joint}} of pseudosuchians (including crocodilians) and phytosaurs, passing between the astragalus and {{calcaneum}}, is also called crurotarsal joint in the literature. In the skeletons of the phytosaurs {{and most of}} the pseudosuchians this <b>joint</b> <b>bends</b> around a peg on the astragalus which fits into a socket in the calcaneum (the “crocodile normal” tarsus); only in the skeletons of the ornithosuchid pseudosuchians a peg on the calcaneum fits into a socket in the astragalus (the “crocodile reversed” tarsus). Strictly speaking this ankle is not a crurotarsal joint in the previously discussed sense, as it's situated between the two proximal tarsal bones. However, while calcaneum is not fixed to the fibula, the astragalus is fixed to the tibia by a suture and thus in practice it functions {{as an extension of the}} crus.|$|R

We model the underlying shape of a human hand by means of sweeps which follow a simplified skeleton. The resulting swept surfaces are blended, and an auxiliary surface is then bound to the swept representation in the palm region. In the areas of this palm-control surface where bulges occur in certain poses of a real hand, the vertices are given their own trajectories, so that the palm forms realistic shapes as the <b>joints</b> <b>bend.</b> Palm lines can also be modeled as valleys in the skin by sketching them on a displacement map on the palmcontrol surface, and activating them when appropriate joint movements take place. Self-intersections and collisions are detected using geometric primitives that are automatically generated from, and deform with, the sweeps and palm surface. Our algorithm runs in real time, and the naturalism of its results are demonstrated by comparative images of modeled and real hands, including several challenging poses...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} novel {{approach}} to interactive character skinning, which is robust to extreme character movements, handles skin contacts and produces the effect of skin elasticity (sliding). Our approach builds {{on the idea of}} implicit skinning in which the character is approximated by a 3 D scalar field and mesh-vertices are appropriately re-projected. Instead of being bound by an initial skinning solution used to initialize the shape at each time step, we use the skin mesh to directly track iso-surfaces of the field over time. Technical problems are two-fold: firstly, all contact surfaces generated between skin parts should be captured as iso-surfaces of the implicit field; secondly, the tracking method should capture elastic skin effects when the <b>joints</b> <b>bend,</b> and as the character returns to its rest shape, so the skin must follow. Our solutions include: new composition operators enabling blending effects and local self-contact between implicit surfaces, as well as a tangential relaxation scheme derived from the as-rigid-as possible energy to solve the tracking problem...|$|R

Then the error caused by the color changes of the <b>joint</b> <b>bending</b> can be avoided. This strategy is a significant step forward from a finger force estimator that requires tedious finger joint setting. The approach is evaluated experimentally.
