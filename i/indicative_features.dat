We experiment this model on two highly related and agglutinative languages namely Tamil and Telugu, and compare our results with {{the state of the art}} Morfessor system. We show that, knowledge of morph length has a positive impact and provides competitive results in terms of overall performance. ...|$|R

40|$|Early {{diagnosis}} of neurodegenerative dis-orders (ND) such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related Dementias {{is currently a}} challenge. Currently, AD can only be di-agnosed by examining the patient’s brain after death and Dementia is diagnosed typically through consensus using spe-cific diagnostic criteria and extensive neu-ropsychological examinations with tools such as the Mini-Mental State Examina-tion (MMSE) or the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). In this paper, we use several Machine Learning (ML) al-gorithms to build diagnostic models us-ing syntactic and lexical features resulting from verbal utterances of AD and related Dementia patients. We emphasize that the best diagnostic model distinguished the AD and related Dementias group from the healthy elderly group with 74 % F-Measure using Support Vector Machines (SVM). Additionally, we perform several statistical tests to indicate {{the significance of the}} selected linguistic features. Our re-sults show that syntactic and lexical fea-tures could be good <b>indicative</b> <b>features</b> for helping to diagnose AD and related De-mentias. ...|$|E

40|$|International audiencePurpose: The US {{appearance}} of Post - traumatic myositis ossificans (PTMO) {{is not well}} established, because only few cases have been described. The aim {{of this paper is}} to report the US features of PMTO in a quite large cohort of patients. Methods: Fifteen patients with histological diagnosis of PTMO were enrolled. The following US parameters were evaluated: mass; calcification; Power Doppler signal; relationship with contiguous structures. Results: Five patients (33. 3 %) were diagnosed as early PTMO and ten (66. 6 %) as mature PTMO. As common characteristics of both early and mature PTMO, US examination showed an oval hypoechoic mass, without infiltrative borders, located in muscle belly. In the early phases, a center of less echogenicity was observed, associated with an outer sheet - like hyperechoic peripheral rim, while, in mature phase, the peripheral calcification was more reflective and distal acoustic shadowing was observed. Conclusion: US is highly sensitive in the detection of PTMO and it can be used for serial evaluation. It can provide <b>indicative</b> <b>features</b> in the differential diagnosis between PTMO and malignant soft tissue tumors...|$|E
40|$|Violin {{practice}} in a home environment, where there is often no teacher available, can benefit from automatic music transcription to provide feedback to the student. This paper describes a high performance violin transcription system with three main contributions. First, as onset detection is an important but challenging task for automatic transcription of pitched non-percussive music, such as from the violin, we propose an effective audio-only onset detection approach based on supervised learning. The proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods substantially. Second, we introduce the visual modality, i. e., bowing and fingering of the violin playing, to infer onsets, thus enhancing the audio-only onset detection. We devise automatic and realtime video processing algorithms to extract <b>indicative</b> <b>features</b> of onsets from bowing and fingering videos. Third, we evaluate state-of-the-art multimodal fusion techniques to fuse audio and visual modalities and show this improves onset detection and transcription performance significantly. The audio-visual fusion based violin transcription system provides more accurate transcribed results as learning feedback even in acoustically inferior environments. With efficient and fully automatic audio-visual analysis components, the system can be easily deployed in a home environment...|$|E

50|$|It {{should be}} noted that the 'age' of a reconstructed {{sequence}} is determined using a molecular clock model, and often several are employed. This dating technique is often calibrated using geological time-points (such as ancient ocean constituents or BIFs) and while these clocks offer the only method of inferring a very ancient protein's age, they have sweeping error margins and are diffuclt to defend against contrary data. To this end, ASR 'age' should really be only used as an <b>indicative</b> <b>feature</b> and is often surpassed altogether for a measurement of the number of substitutions between the ancestral and the modern sequences (the fundiment on which the clock is calculated). That being said, the use of a clock allows one to compare observed biophysical data of an ASR protein to the geological or ecological environment at the time. For example, ASR studies on bacterial EF-Tus (proteins involved in translation, that are likely rarely subject to HGT and typically exhibit Tms ~2C greater than Tenv) indicate a hotter Precambrian earth which fits very closely with geological data on ancient earth ocean temperatures based on Oxygen-18 isotopic levels. ASR studies of yeast Adhs reveal that the emergence of subfunctionalized Adhs for ethanol metabolism (not just waste excretion) arose at a time similar to the dawn of fleshy fruit in the Cambrian era and that before this emergence, Adh served to excrete ethanol as a byproduct of excess pyruvate. The use of a clock also perhaps indicates that the origin of life occurred before the earliest molecular fossils indicate (>4.1Ga), but given the debatable reliability of molecular clocks, such observations should be taken with caution.|$|R
