25|$|Although many around Presley {{were worried}} about his {{worsening}} drug dependency, Parker appeared to ignore the problem. Several members of Presley's band later stated that Parker had no idea just how bad the situation was, although others have stood by the suggestion that Parker just didn't want to admit {{there was such a}} problem because he didn't know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> and was worried about any negative publicity it would create. According to Parker himself, he did attempt to talk to his client about the matter, but Presley simply told him to stay out of his personal life.|$|E

25|$|Internment {{had been}} used {{a number of times}} during Northern Ireland's (and the Republic of Ireland's) history, but had not {{previously}} been used during the Troubles, which began in the late 1960s. Ulster loyalist paramilitaries such as the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) had been engaged in a low-level violent campaign since 1966. After the August 1969 riots, the British Army was deployed on the streets to bolster the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). Up until this point the Irish Republican Army (IRA) had been largely inactive. However, as the violence and political situation worsened, the IRA was divided over <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> It split into two factions, the Provisional IRA and Official IRA. In 1970–71, the Provisionals began to retaliate against the British Army and the RUC. The Officials' policy was more defensive. During 1970–71, there were numerous clashes between state forces and the two wings of the IRA, between the IRAs and loyalists, and occasionally between the IRAs. Most loyalist attacks were directed against Catholic civilians, but they also clashed with state forces and the IRA on a number of occasions.|$|E
500|$|After Siddhartha {{became the}} enlightened Gautama Buddha, {{he sought to}} find his former {{teachers}} Arada Kalama and Udraka Ramaputra in order to teach them. Realising that they had died, the Buddha decided to find Koṇḍañña and his colleagues to share his teachings. Koṇḍañña and his companions were skeptical of Gautama Buddha after his abandonment of asceticism, and initially refused to acknowledge his presence, except to offer {{a seat on the}} ground. However, the ascetics were soon won over when they sensed that the Buddha had changed since they left him. The Buddha preached the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta, which deals with the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path, the core pillars of Buddhist teaching regarding the intrinsic suffering of existence and <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> Koṇḍañña reached the sotāpanna stage of arahathood upon hearing this, becoming the first human to comprehend the teachings. The Buddha acknowledged this by remarking [...] "annasi vata bho Kondanno (meaning [...] "you have realised, Kondanna").|$|E

[...] for Alice In Chains' second album Dirt in Wood's memory. He also {{dedicated}} Alice In Chains' debut album Facelift to Wood, {{as well as}} his late mother. Speaking with Spin magazine in 1991, Cantrell confirmed that the song [...] "Sunshine" [...] from Facelift was written about his mother's death. “When I was a little kid, I'd always tell her, “I'll be famous and buy you a house and you'll never have to work again. I'll take care of you like you took care of me.’ When she passed away, it was a really sh–ty time for me. I didn't know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> then, and I still don't.

2500|$|Kiedis {{was briefly}} {{kicked out of}} the band, and given a month to rehabilitate. Kiedis {{completed}} the rehab and rejoined the Red Hot Chili Peppers in Los Angeles to record their third album The Uplift Mofo Party Plan (1987). Flea has referred to the album as [...] "the 'rockingest' record" [...] the band has ever made. The Uplift Mofo Party Plan proved to be far more successful, commercially and critically, than the Chili Peppers' preceding albums, registering at number 148 on the Billboard 200. Following the Uplift tour, Slovak's drug use dramatically increased. Flea's relationship with Slovak faded, and Slovak became isolated and depressed. On 28 June 1988, Slovak was found dead of a heroin overdose. Flea reflected: [...] "I didn't really {{know how to deal with}} that sadness, and I don't think [...] knew <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> either." [...] Irons, who was taking Slovak's death particularly hard, left the group.|$|E
2500|$|On 23 February 2010, Tebbit was {{alleged to}} have {{attacked}} a ceremonial Chinese dragon during a Chinese New Year parade.

Tebbit later said: [...] "I don't think my reaction was extreme at all. I placed my hand on the drum so I could diminish the noise and asked the drummer what was going on and got a rap on the knuckles for my pain. I was then barged by the dragon. I barged it back and might have done something like kick it. I wasn't sure <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> I've never been barged by a dragon before". A local Conservative town councillor, Mr Chung, visited Tebbit the day after the incident and received an apology. Chung said: [...] "I said his actions were upsetting. He apologised.
