40|$|The initial {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate and introduce fabrication techniques based on W/ 0 /W double emulsion and 0 /W single emulsion systems with solvent evaporation for the incorporation of a surrogate macromolecule (BSA) into microspheres and microcapsules fabricated using P(HB-HV}, PEA and their blends. Biodegradation, expressed as changes in the gross and ultrastructural morphology of BSA loaded microparticulates with time was monitored using SEM concomitant with BSA release. Spherical microparticulates were successfully fabricated using both the W/ 0 /W and 0 /W emulsion systems. Both microspheres and microcapsules released BSA {{over a period of}} 24 to 26 days. BSA release from P(HB-HV) 20 % PCL 11 microcapsules increased steadily with time, while BSA release from all other microparticulates was characterised by an initial lag phase followed by exponential release lasting 6 - 11 days. Microcapsules were found to biodegrade more rapidly than microspheres fabricated from the same polymer. The incubation of microparticulates in newborn calf serum; synthetic gastric juice and pancreatin solution showed that microspheres and microcapsules were susceptible to enzymatic biodegradation. The in vitro incubation of microparticulates in Hank's buffer demonstrated limited biodegradation of microspheres and microcapsules by simple chemical hydrolysis. BSA release was thought to ocurr {{as a result of the}} macromolecule diffusing through either inherent micropores or via pores and channels generated in situ by previously dissolved BSA. However, in all cases, <b>irrespective</b> <b>of</b> <b>percentage</b> loading or fabrication polymer, low encapsulation efficiencies were obtained with W/ 0 /W and 0 /W techniques (4. 2 ± 0. 9 %- 15. 5 ± 0. 5 %,n= 3), thus restricting the use of these techniques for the generation of microparticulate sustained drug delivery devices. In order to overcome this low encapsulation efficiency, a W/ 0 single emulsion technique was developed and evaluated in an attempt to minimise the loss of the macromolecule into the continuous aqueous phase and increase encapsulation efficiency. Poly(lactide-co-glycolide) [PLCG] 75 : 25 and 50 : 50, PEA alone and PEA blended with PLCG 50 : 50 to accelerate biodegradation, were used to microencapsulate the water soluble antibiotic vancomycin, a putative replacement for gentamicin in the control of bacterial infection in orthopaedic surgery especially during total hip replacement. Spherical microspheres (17. 39 ± 6. 89 ~m,n= 74 - 56. 5 ± 13. 8 ~m,n= 70) were successfully fabricated with vancomycin loadings of 10, 25 and 50 %, regardless of the polymer blend used. All microspheres remained structurally intact over the period of vancomycin release and exhibited high percentage yields(40. 75 ± 2. 86 %- 97. 16 ± 4. 3 %,n= 3) and encapsulation efficiencies (47. 75 ± 9. 0 %- 96. 74 ± 13. 2 %,n= 12). PLCG 75 : 25 microspheres with a vancomycin loading of 50 % were judged to be the most useful since they had an encapsulation efficiency of 96. 74 + 13. 2 %, n= 12 and sustained therapeutically significant vancomycin release (15 - 25 μg/ml) for up to 26 days. This work has provided the means for the fabrication of a spectrum of prototype biodegradable microparticulates, whose biodegradation has been characterised in physiological media and which have the potential for the sustained delivery of therapeutically useful macromolecules including water soluble antibiotics for orthopaedic applications...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{situation}} in which a cheap measure (X) is observed in a large, representative twin sample, and a more expensive measure (Y) is observed in a selected subsample. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the optimal selection design in terms of the statistical power to detect genetic and environmental influences on the variance of Y and on the covariance of X and Y. Data were simulated for 4000 dizygotic and 2000 monozygotic twins. Missingness (87 % vs. 97 %) was then introduced in accordance with 7 selection designs: (i) concordant low + individual high design; (ii) extreme concordant design; (iii) extreme concordant and discordant design (EDAC); (iv) extreme discordant design; (v) individual score selection design; (vi) selection of an optimal number of MZ and DZ twins; and (vii) missing completely at random. The statistical power to detect the influence of additive and dominant genetic and shared environmental effects on the variance of Y and on the covariance between X and Y was investigated. The best selection design is the individual score selection design. The power to detect additive genetic effects is high <b>irrespective</b> <b>of</b> the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> missingness or selection design. The power to detect shared environmental effects is acceptable when the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> missingness is 87 %, but is low when the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> missingness is 97 %, except for the individual score selection design, in which the power remains acceptable.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of sawdust reinforced vinyl ester resin composites post-cured in microwaves have been measured and evaluated in earlier studies. This basic but critical and important data have caused {{interests in the}} relevant industry in Australia. This study is therefore carried out to measure and evaluate the thermal properties of the composites {{with a view to}} benefit the civil and construction industry as the materials are used in the industry. The original contributions of this paper are that samples post-cured in microwaves, <b>irrespective</b> <b>of</b> the <b>percentage</b> by weight and particle size of sawdust, have higher glass transition temperatures than their counterparts post-cured in an oven; these imply that the stiffness of the samples post-cured in microwaves are higher than their peers. From previous study, it was discovered that the fracture toughness increased with increasing particulate loading. These properties are vital in civil engineering applications because civil structures need composites with high rigidity and fracture toughness. It is hoped that the discussions and results in this work would not only contribute towards the development of sawdust reinforced vinyl ester composites with better material properties, but also useful for the investigations of thermal and {{mechanical properties}} in other composites. ...|$|R

We examined whether delaying the oocyte maturation trigger in IVF/ICSI affected the number of mature oocytes and investigated the potential influence of serum progesterone levels in this process. Methods: Between January 31, 2011, and December 31, 2011, 262 consecutive patients were monitored using ultrasound plus hormonal evaluation. Those with > = 3 follicles with a mean diameter of > = 18 mm were divided into 2 groups depending on their serum progesterone levels. In cases with a progesterone level 1 ng/ml were randomised in the same manner, <b>irrespective</b> <b>of</b> the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> larger follicles (> = 18 mm). The number of metaphase II oocytes was our primary outcome variable. Because some patients were included more than once, correction for duplicate patients was performed. Results: In the study arm with low progesterone (1 ng/ml), the mean numbers of metaphase II oocytes (+/-SD) were 11. 81 (+/- 9. 91) and 12. 03 (+/- 7. 09) for the delayed and control groups, respectively. After adjusting for PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) and female pathology, the mean difference was - 0. 44 (95 % Cl: - 3. 65 - 2. 78; p = 0. 79).

The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the influence of chronic cardioselective beta blockade on the %HRmax and %HRR model. Methods Ten healthy male subjects randomly received oral placebo or beta-blocker bisoprolol (5 mg/day) for 2 weeks using a double-blind, crossover design. In the second week, the subjects performed a cardiopulmonary exercise test until exhaustion to determine the aerobic (AeT) and anaerobic (AnT) threshold. Results No significant differences were found for absolute and relative values of oxygen consumption, power output and ratings of perceived exertion at AeT, AnT and maximum workload. Mean HR was significantly (P< 0. 05) lower at rest (– 15 ± 5 bpm), AeT (– 19 ± 8 bpm), AnT (– 22 ± 10 bpm) and maximal workload (– 19 ± 11 bpm) with bisoprolol compared to placebo. <b>Percentage</b> <b>of</b> maximal heart rate (%HRmax) was significantly (P< 0. 05) reduced at rest (43 versus 39 %), AeT (64 versus 60 %) and AnT (86 versus 82 %), a trend for a reduction was found for %HRR at AnT (75 versus 71 %, P= 0. 07). Conclusions Exercise prescription using %HRmax or %HRRmethods are of limited accuracy for patients taking beta-blockers. Although %HRmax and %HRR are easy to determine and therefore attractive, we suggest that the most precise exercise prescription would depend on AeT and AnT. <b>Percentages</b> <b>of</b> maximal oxygen consumption or maximal workload or rating...|$|R

However, in studies using go/no-go tasks, findings regarding the presence of response inhibition deficits in nicotine-dependent individuals are mixed. This might be due to differences between studies on a number of task parameters. Here we aimed to identify task conditions under which go/no-go task performance deficits can be observed in smokers and to characterize the nature of such deficits. Sixty-one male students (30 smokers, 31 non-smokers) performed a go/no-go task while independently manipulating three task parameters: (1) percentage no-go trials (50 % or 25 %), (2) stimulus presentation time (600 ms or 200 ms), and (3) nature of no-go stimuli (cigarette related or cigarette unrelated). Three measures, reaction time on go trials and percentage correct responses on go and no-go trials, served as performance indicators. Under 200 -ms but not 600 -ms stimulus presentation conditions, the smokers responded faster on go trials and made more errors on both go and no-go trials than the non-smokers did. These differences occurred <b>irrespective</b> <b>of</b> the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> no-go trials and nature of no-go stimuli. The accuracy differences disappeared after controlling for the response time differences, suggesting a strong speed-accuracy trade-off. This study contributes to unraveling the conditions under which smokers display impaired inhibition performance and helps to characterize the nature of this impairment. Under task conditions prompting fast responding, smokers are more prone to increase response speed and to make more errors than non-smokers...|$|R

Red soil was placed on top of clean aquifer sand. A simulated semi-confined/semi-unconfined aquifer was formed in a soil tank connected with the {{rainfall simulator}}. Five ponds and five observation wells were dug along a red soil slope to measure groundwater levels, interception and storage of the ponds from rainfall runoff. The runoff collector (or a measuring tank) connected with the rainfall simulator was used to measure the surface runoff. The results showed that the interrelationships <b>of</b> the slope, <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> stone covering, groundwater level, surface runoff, and the capability of interception and storage of the ponds were varied and irregular. No systematic patterns were detected for the changes in groundwater level, surface runoff, and capability of interception and storage of the ponds with different stone covering percentages and different slopes. No threshold values were apparent. For a 5 °slope, an increase in the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> stone covering and a decrease in the amount of surface runoff and groundwater level increased the capability of interception and storage of the ponds.

40|$|AbstractThe current {{primary care}} {{units of the}} US {{healthcare}} system are strained by supply-demand deficiency. Last 12 years have seen a decline in number of US medical students opting for primary care after their medical education. Research studies have recommended solutions targeting, primary care payment reform, investment in primary care infrastructure and organization, and attracting more US medical students to primary care. Such reforms demand expensive implementation plans and might take years to yield benefits. Meanwhile, the generation of baby boomers and the healthcare reform under current US administration (insuring additional 33 - 43 million patients) may stress out the primary care providers in near future. In this paper, we investigate the usefulness of wearable health monitoring devices, to alleviate primary care patient load. To conduct our study, we adopted the discrete event simulation method to simulate the proposed model and analyze the behaviour of the same in terms of performance measures. We simulated three scenarios with different vital sign measurement time and physician consultation time. In addition we varied the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> patient population adopting the wearable device health monitoring (WHMS) program. In all the three scenarios, the WHMS system yielded beneficial results in absorbing more patients and reducing patient denials than the current primary care system <b>irrespective</b> <b>of</b> adoption <b>percentages.</b> However the average patient wait times were sensitive to the adoption percentages. On the whole the simulation results indicated that wearable health monitoring devices could act as a potential solution in reducing the patient load across the primary care system...|$|R

In experiments 1 and 2 D. P. W. was incorporated into diets at varying levels on a crude protein equivalent basis, but without adjustment of energy content. Levels up to 20 % were fed to chicks to 4 weeks of age in experiment 1. There was a significant depression in growth when chicks were fed 10 % D. P. W., but the inclusion of either 15 or 20 % D. P. W. {{did not result in}} a further depression. Feed efficiency was significantly increased when 10 % D. P. W. was included in the diet. The feeding of either 15 or 20 % D. P.

The incorporation of 10 % D. P. W. into the ration resulted in a significant decrease in body weight at 8 weeks. Diets formulated to be both isonitrogenous (true protein basis) and isocaloric were used in experiment 3. Levels up to 20 % D. P.

40|$|Congestion games model a {{wide variety}} of {{real-world}} resource congestion problems, such as selfish network routing, traffic route guidance in congested areas, taxi fleet optimization and crowd movement in busy areas. However, existing research in congestion games assumes: (a) deterministic movement of agents between resources; and (b) perfect rationality (i. e. maximizing their own expected value) of all agents. Such assumptions are not reasonable in dynamic domains where decision support has to be provided to humans. For instance, in optimizing the performance of a taxi fleet serving a city, movement of taxis can be involuntary or nondeterministic (decided by the specific customer who hires the taxi) and more importantly, taxi drivers may not follow advice provided by the decision support system (due to bounded rationality of humans). To that end, we contribute: (a) a general framework for representing congestion games under uncertainty for populations with assorted notions of rationality. (b) a scalable approach for solving the decision problem for perfectly rational agents which are in the mix with boundedly rational agents; and (c) a detailed evaluation on a synthetic and real world data set to illustrate the usefulness of our new approach with respect to key social welfare metrics {{in the context of an}} assorted human-agent population. An interesting result from our experiments on a real-world taxi fleet optimization problem is that it is better (in terms of revenue and operational efficiency) for taxi drivers to follow perfectly rational strategies <b>irrespective</b> <b>of</b> the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> drivers not following the advice...|$|R

However, results of studies on the performance on response inhibition tasks of individuals evidencing potentially problematic levels of alcohol drinking are mixed. Objectives: We assessed conditions under which persons with a relatively high risk of alcohol dependence show inhibition deficits in such tasks and investigated the nature of those deficits. Methods: Fifty-eight male undergraduate students, 27 of which were high-risk drinkers according to the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, performed a go/no-go inhibition task with differing <b>percentages</b> <b>of</b> no-go trials (50 % vs. 25 %), stimulus presentation times (600 vs. 200 ms), and types of go and no-go stimuli (alcohol related vs. -unrelated). Response inhibition was indexed by response time (RT) to go trials and response accuracy on go and no-go trials. Results: There were no differences between low- and high-risk drinkers on any of the three outcome measures under the 600 -ms stimulus presentation condition. Under the 200 -ms condition, the high-risk drinkers showed faster RTs to go stimuli, and more errors on both go- and no-go trials than the low-risk drinkers, <b>irrespective</b> <b>of</b> type and <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> no-go stimuli. However, the accuracy differences between the two groups disappeared after controlling for the RT on go trials, suggesting a speed-accuracy trade-off. Conclusion: High-risk drinkers' response inhibition deficits are not restricted to alcohol-related cues and are especially likely to occur under conditions prompting fast responding. These findings could be used to inform treatment, suggesting the promotion of strategies aimed at preventing high-risk alcohol users from making quick decisions...|$|R

We begin by discussing when these measures should, and should not, be preferred over Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient on conceptual grounds. For testing the null hypothesis of no monotonic association, our simulation studies found both rank coefficients show similar performance to variants of the Pearson product-moment measure of association, and provide only slightly better performance than Pearson's measure even if the two measured traits are non-normally distributed. Where variants of the Pearson measure are not appropriate, there was no strong reason (based on our results) to select either of our rank-based alternatives over the other for testing the null hypothesis of no monotonic association. Further, our simulation studies indicated that for both rank coefficients there exists at least one method for calculating confidence intervals that supplies results close to the desired level if there are no tied values in the data. In this case, Kendall's coefficient produces consistently narrower confidence intervals, and might thus be preferred on that basis. However, if there are any ties in the data, <b>irrespective</b> <b>of</b> whether the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> ties is small or large, Spearman's measure returns values closer to the desired coverage rates, whereas Kendall's results differ more and more from the desired level as the number of ties increases, especially for large correlation values.
