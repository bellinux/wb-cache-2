Classes performed Phase I (13-week basic officer's training) at Fort Knox and transferred together to complete Phase II (10-week advanced officer training course) at either Fort Lee (Quartermaster), Fort Eustis (Transportation), or Aberdeen Proving Ground (Ordnance Corps). Class 9-66 candidates who completed Phase <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>pick</b> between the Armor, Quartermaster, Transportation, or Ordnance Corps Phase II. Classes 14-66, 18-66, 22-66, and 24-66 performed both Phases I and II at Fort Knox and were Armor Corps officers.|$|E

60|$|I walked on, alert, {{trying to}} take in everything, {{wondering}} if I would meet Steele, wondering how I would know him if we did meet. But <b>I</b> believed <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>picked</b> that Ranger out of a thousand strangers, though I had never seen him.|$|R
6000|$|... "The 'all {{sorts of}} things' did not amount to much, Miss Regan. I made myself as useful as <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> and <b>picked</b> up French; {{and at last}} when the {{privateer}} sailed away I {{walked down to the}} shore and met our sailors when they landed. There was, I can assure you, nothing in any way heroic about the part I had to play." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{carriages}} were coming, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only <b>pick</b> my {{way back}} by the shortest route, through stacks of drain-tiles and columns of garden-pots, to Eustace, who, becoming afraid it would seem {{as if he were}} keeping shop, was squeezing down the fingers of his left-hand glove, while impressing on Mr. Yolland and me that everyone must understand he was only there as chairman of the directors.|$|R

6000|$|... "I think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>pick</b> out tunes, if I had any instrument, {{which could}} be made as handy to me as my lace-pillow. But I dare say I deceive myself. At all events, I shall never know." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{forgot the}} advice I had received, and remembered only the months he had goaded me. And I was even {{beginning}} to speculate how <b>I</b> <b>could</b> best <b>pick</b> a quarrel {{with him on}} any issue but politics, when an unexpected incident diverted me. Of a sudden the tall, ungainly form of Percy Singleton filled the doorway, wrapped in a greatcoat. He swept the room at a glance, and then strode rapidly toward the corner where I sat.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was good}} logic, good, earthly, {{feminine}} logic, {{and if it}} satisfied her <b>I</b> certainly <b>could</b> <b>pick</b> no flaws in it. As {{a matter of fact}} it was about the only kind of logic that could be brought to bear upon my problem. We fell into a general conversation then, asking and answering many questions on each side. She was curious to learn of the customs of my people and displayed a remarkable knowledge of events on Earth. When I questioned her closely on this seeming familiarity with earthly things she laughed, and cried out: ...|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} a {{discussion}} of, but mostly a further reflection on, the 2011 CAR Conference paper by Abernethy, Bouwens, and van Lent, “The Role of Performance Measures in the Intertemporal Decisions of Business Unit Managers” (this issue, henceforth ABvL). If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>picked</b> a title for my discussion article, I would have called it, “The Informational and Motivational Dimensions of Managerial Long-Term Orientation: Tackling Ignorance and Pressure,” for reasons that will become obvious as I develop my key points underpinning this discussion...|$|R

60|$|For a long time, though I {{certainly}} {{did my best}} to listen, I could hear nothing but a low gabbling; but at last the voices began to grow higher, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>pick</b> up a word or two, mostly oaths, from the captain.|$|E
5000|$|Renowned singer Madonna in an {{interview}} for the May 1985 edition of Spin had said, [...] "My favorite button is my belly button. I have the most perfect belly button: an inny, and there’s no lint in it. When I stick my finger in my belly button, I feel a nerve {{in the center of}} my body shoot up my spine. If 100 belly buttons were lined up against a wall, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> definitely <b>pick</b> out which one is mine." [...] Displaying her bare navel during performances became her trademark.|$|R
5000|$|Since her {{retirement}} in 1999 (stated {{at the time}} to be a [...] "sabbatical"), she has stayed away from the public eye and rarely gives interviews to talk about her past with Sierra On-Line. However, in a 2006 interview, she admitted that her favorite game she created was Phantasmagoria and not King's Quest: [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only <b>pick</b> one game, I would pick Phantasmagoria, as I enjoyed working on it immensely and it was so very challenging (and I love to be challenged!). However, in my heart, I will always love the King's Quest series and, especially, King's Quest I, since it was the game that really 'made' Sierra On-Line." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{night was}} dark and overcast. Two yellow {{pinpoints}} far away showed the passing of a ship, and nearer was a red glare that came and went. Had not the electricity of my glow-lamp exhausted itself, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have got <b>picked</b> up that night. In spite of the inordinate fatigue I was beginning to feel, I was excited now, {{and for a time}} hopeful, in a feverish, impatient way, that so my travelling might end.|$|R
60|$|Upon {{the boards}} of my own crib I spread all the old canvas and old clothes <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>pick</b> up. For a pillow, I wrapped an old jacket round a log. This helped a little {{the wear and tear}} of one's bones when the ship rolled.|$|E

6000|$|... "I've {{seen him}} {{once or twice}} before he fell into Broughton's hands; the {{imported}} Red Rover strain is marked in him, {{and a friend of}} mine, who's going in for Herefords, told me not to stick at a few dollars if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>pick</b> up such a bull." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I fancy so," [...] Rupert said, drily. [...] "I hit him rather hard.

60|$|The {{last game}} was now four all. This next hand must settle {{it one way}} or the other. He undid his sash, and I put away my sword-belt. He was cool, this Englishman, and I tried to be so also, but the {{perspiration}} would trickle into my eyes. The deal lay with him, and I may confess to you, my friends, that my hands shook so that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hardly <b>pick</b> my cards from the rock. But when I raised them, what was the first thing that my eyes rested upon? It was the king, the king, the glorious king of trumps! My mouth was open to declare it when the words were frozen upon my lips by the appearance of my comrade.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} been, hitherto," [...] {{answered}} le Bourdon, so frankly as {{at once to}} quiet his companion's sensitiveness, [...] "though I will not answer for the future. Now that I have so many with me, we may make some of them necessary. Mind--I say SOME, not all of my present guests. If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have my <b>pick,</b> pretty Margery, the present company would give me ALL I can desire, and more too. I should not think of going to Detroit for that companion, since she {{is to be found}} so much nearer." ...|$|R
60|$|The dog 'owled {{a bit at}} fust, but he quieted down arter a bit. He was a nice-looking animal, but one dog is {{much the}} same as another to me, and if I 'ad one ten years I don't suppose <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>pick</b> it out from two or three others.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was in the}} Yeomanry when I was younger," [...] Norgate {{explained}} slowly. [...] "I {{had some}} thought of entering the army before I took up diplomacy.

60|$|Now I {{had heard}} {{much the same}} sort of story in other islands, and the same white powder always to the front, which made me think the less of it. For all that, I went over to Randall's place to see what <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>pick</b> up, and found Case on the doorstep, {{cleaning}} a gun.|$|E
40|$|There are {{few people}} who would deny that Autoconf, Automake and Libtool have {{revolutionized}} the free software world. While there are many thousands of Autotools advocates, some developers absolutely hate the Autotools, with a passion. Why? Let me try to explain with an analogy. In the early 1990 !s I {{was working on the}} final stages of my bachelor!s degree in computer science at Brigham Young University. I took a 400 -level computer graphics class, wherein I was introduced to C++, and the object-oriented programming paradigm. For the next 5 years, I had a love-hate relationship with C++. I was a pretty good C coder by that time, and <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>could</b> easily <b>pick</b> up C++, as close in syntax as it was to C. How wrong I was. I fought late into the night, more often than I!d care to recall, with the C++ compiler over performance issues...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes, ma'am, I {{always lived}} somewheres, but it wasn't nowheres in partikler. You see I'd neither father nor mother, an' though {{a good old}} 'ooman did take me in, she couldn't purvide a bed or blankets, an' her 'ome was stuffy, so I {{preferred}} {{to live in the}} streets, an' sleep of a night w'en I couldn't pay for a lodgin', in empty casks and under wegitable carts in Covent Garden Market, or in empty sugar 'ogsheads. I liked the 'ogsheads best w'en I was 'ungry, an' that was most always, 'cause <b>I</b> <b>could</b> sometimes <b>pick</b> a little sugar that was left in the cracks an' 'oles, w'en they 'adn't bin cleaned out a'ready. Also I slep' under railway-arches, and on door-steps. But sometimes I 'ad raither disturbed nights, 'cause the coppers wouldn't let a feller sleep in sitch places if they could 'elp it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not {{immediately}} <b>pick</b> {{it up and}} depart. The beautiful room in which I found myself was a revelation to me. Until that moment I had not known that I had tastes and sympathies {{of a higher order}} than might have been expected of the youthful son of a boat-builder. Those artistic furnishings aroused within a love of the beautiful which I did not know I possessed. The carpets, the walls, the pictures, the hangings in the windows, the furniture, the ornaments,--everything, in fact, impressed me with such a delight that I did not wish to move or go away.|$|R

"That <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>pick</b> up {{a better}} suit {{for half the}} price at old Battista, the Lombard's at Bordeaux; nevertheless, since young Eustace would be the show of the camp if he {{appeared}} there provided in Ralph's fashion, it may be as well to see whether there be any reasonableness in this old knave." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'See here,' he said, {{pointing}} {{to one of}} the notes, 'the shape of that [...] "w" [...] in the signature of the chief cashier.

6000|$|Beyond {{the opening}} {{paragraph}} I have quoted the handwriting was almost illegible, {{and in the}} dim light it was only here and there that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>pick</b> out such words as [...] "bank," [...] "assumed," [...] "risk," [...] "name," [...] and so forth, which gave but an inkling of the real contents of the precious document.|$|E
60|$|At length the {{scrubbing}} being over, {{the mate}} began heaving buckets of water about, to wash every thing clean, {{by way of}} finishing off. He must have thought this fine sport, just as captains of fire engines love to point the tube of their hose; for he kept me running after him with full buckets of water, and sometimes chased a little chip all over the deck, with a continued flood, till at last he sent it flying out of a scupper-hole into the sea; when if he had only given me permission, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>picked</b> {{it up in a}} trice, and dropped it overboard without saying one word, and without wasting so much water. But he said there was plenty of water in the ocean, and to spare; which was true enough, but then I who had to trot after him with the buckets, had no more legs and arms than I wanted for my own use.|$|R
30|$|Initially, I {{found these}} sudden {{injunctions}} disruptive and annoying. How <b>could</b> <b>I</b> just <b>pick</b> up and leave, not even knowing where I was going or {{for how long}} I would be away? After months of practice, however, I realized that her summons was a valuable teaching. Not only did I get to see many wonderful temples and meet extraordinary people, but Shihfu’s call taught me to stay alert in the moment and {{to be ready for}} anything. It taught me both nonattachment and flexibility.|$|R
40|$|As I {{look back}} on the five years I spent at the University of Michigan, I realize that several times fate led me onto a better path than the one I had {{originally}} intended to follow, starting with the decision to come to the University of Michigan for graduate school, which was not my first choice. I had opted for UCLA, but a twist of fate led me to come to Michigan to be close to the person whom I would soon be united to. The beginning was not easy nor without tears, but I soon learned to enjoy the high quality of Michigan’s Mathematics department, and greatly benefited from all my math classes. Another twist of fate led me to work with Selim Esedo¯glu, instead of the professor I had originally intended to work with. This was probably {{the best thing that ever}} happened to me during my graduate studies at Michigan, and for this I would like to thank Peter Smereka who, given my interests, helped me discern the most suitable advisor for me. I don’t think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>picked</b> a better advisor. My first thanks thus go to my advisor Selim Esedo¯glu who always managed to have time for me whenever I needed. Selim pushed me and encouraged me to do always more than <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> and provided guidance throughout my entire doctorate. I als...|$|R
