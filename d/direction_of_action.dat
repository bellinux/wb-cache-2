The analyzed definitions suggest that the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> pedagogical <b>action</b> {{is based on the}} synthesis of theatrical and pedagogical art. The <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> pedagogical <b>action</b> is oriented toward methodical provision of modern trends in the development of humanistic education and creates relevant emotional field for the comprehensive development of personality. As a result, we have found out that the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> pedagogical <b>action</b> in the Russian Federation is practice-oriented and is used as a method of emotional influence on pupil while solving educational tasks of a comprehensive secondary school. More common is the spectrum <b>of</b> using the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> pedagogical <b>action</b> in the national systems of secondary and higher education where this phenomenon is mostly associated with the development of teacher professionalism, their pedagogical mastery that contributes to the organization of the educational process at a new level – a creative function that is oriented toward the establishment of efficient pedagogical interaction.

40|$|Research on {{embodied}} {{approaches to}} language comprehension {{suggests that we}} understand linguistic descriptions <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> by mentally simulating these actions. Evidence {{is provided by the}} action-sentence compatibility effect (ACE) which shows that sensibility judgments for sentences are faster when the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the described <b>action</b> matches the response direction. In two experiments, we investigated whether the ACE relies on actions or on intended action effects. Participants gave sensibility judgments of auditorily presented sentences by producing an action effect on a screen at a location near the body or far from the body. These action effects were achieved by pressing a response button that was located in either the same spatial direction as the action effect, or in the opposite direction. We used a go/no-go task in which the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the to-be-produced <b>action</b> effect was either cued at the onset of each sentence (Experiment 1) or at different points in time before and after sentence onset (Experiment 2). Overall, results showed a relationship between the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the described <b>action</b> and the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>action</b> effect. Furthermore, Experiment 2 indicated that depending on the timing between cue presentation and sentence onset, participants responded either faster when the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the described <b>action</b> matched the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>action</b> effect (positive ACE), or slower (negative ACE). These results provide evidence that the comprehension <b>of</b> <b>action</b> sentences involves the activation <b>of</b> representations <b>of</b> <b>action</b> effects. Concurrently activated representations in sentence comprehension and action planning can lead to both priming and interference, which is discussed {{in the context of the}} theory of event coding...|$|R

5000|$|The devices most {{inherent}} to classical Hollywood cinema {{are those of}} continuity editing. This includes the 180-degree rule, {{one of the major}} visual-spatial elements of continuity editing. The 180-degree rule keeps with the [...] "photographed play" [...] style by creating an imaginary 180-degree axis between the viewer and the shot, allowing viewers to clearly orient themselves within the position and <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>action</b> in a scene. According to the 30-degree rule, cuts in the angle that the scene is viewed from must be significant enough for the viewer to understand the purpose of a change in perspective. Cuts that do not adhere to the 30-degree rule, known as jump cuts, are disruptive to the illusion of temporal continuity between shots. The 180-degree and 30-degree rules are elementary guidelines in film-making that preceded the official start of the classical era by over a decade, as seen in the pioneering 1902 French film A Trip to the Moon. Cutting techniques in classical continuity editing serve to help establish or maintain continuity, as in the cross cut, which establishes the concurrence of action in different locations. Jump cuts are allowed {{in the form of the}} axial cut, which does not change the angle of shooting at all, but has the clear purpose of showing a perspective closer or farther from the subject and therefore does not interfere with temporal continuity.|$|E
