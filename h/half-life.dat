40|$|Biopharmaceuticals hold {{important}} {{value for}} the treatment of severe diseases. However, stability concerns remain one of the main obstacles for their successful market authorization. Generally, physical instabilities (in particular aggregation), in vivo immunogenicity, and short circulation <b>half-lifes</b> due to enzymatic degradation and fast renal elimination pose major challenges. After PEGylation, the covalent conjugation of poly(ethylene glycol) to biopharmaceuticals, decreased enzymatic degradation, prolonged plasma <b>half-lifes,</b> reduced in vivo immunogenicity, and improved formulation stability have been reported. However, several challenges remain for covalent PEGylation: i) the chemical processing and subsequent purification needed to attach the PEG may represent further stress on the protein, resulting in increased aggregation and possible loss of activity, ii) heterogeneous products are obtained requiring separation and characterization, and iii) an observed reduced in vivo bioactivity resulting from decreased interactions of the drug with its receptor due to steric shielding by the PEG. As described in this thesis, we addressed the need for alternative PEGylation approaches by development of novel techniques based on non-covalent interactions...|$|R

5|$|A {{cooperative}} <b>Half-Life</b> {{game was}} first alluded to by publisher Sierra On-Line in November 2000 with {{the announcement of}} a PlayStation 2 version of <b>Half-Life.</b> At the time, however, it was unclear how a cooperative version of <b>Half-Life</b> would be implemented; the developers, Gearbox Software, were still experimenting with finding the most balanced number of players to build a cooperative game around. By E3 2001, the game had acquired the title Decay, named after the scientific concept of exponential decay for consistency with the scientific names used by previous <b>Half-Life</b> titles. While the E3 convention only provided {{a demonstration of the}} main <b>Half-Life</b> PlayStation 2 game, further details were released relating to Decays premise and story, as well as confirming that the cooperative mode was to be designed for two players. The game's use of new model sets were also showcased. These new models were updated versions of Gearbox's High Definition pack for , featuring higher numbers of polygons and animation features such as facial expressions. The enhanced models were around twice as detailed as those in the High Definition pack, which itself was of a much higher quality than the original models in <b>Half-Life.</b> Media updates through the months following E3 showed various screenshots and the trailer to the game. On August 18, 2001, Sierra announced that Decay was nearly complete, and would be submitted to PlayStation 2 manufacturer Sony for verification within days.
