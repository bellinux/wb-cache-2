We represent such databases in terms of Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) and verify their safety using the refinement checker FDR 2.

In 1953, a new electric signal box with electric <b>interlocking</b> and <b>railway</b> <b>signaling</b> were built. The current signal box is from the SRJ station Djursholms Ösby north of Stockholm, and the goods store house is from the former SRJ station Österbybruk. As the station currently includes the main signal control for the ULJ railroad, Marielund Station is always staffed during regular traffic hours.|$|R
50|$|The GWR sited Tackley halt {{just north}} of a level {{crossing}} on the road linking Tackley with the village of Kirtlington. This had a crossing keeper on duty 24 {{hours a day and}} the gates were <b>interlocked</b> with the <b>railway</b> <b>signalling</b> system. However, the route later ceased to be a through road between the two villages, so the railway company withdrew the crossing keeper and redesignated the crossing to be operated by its users.|$|R
500|$|In 1883 {{the first}} {{connection}} to another colony's rail system was made, when the Albury-Wodonga line [...] was completed {{to join the}} New South Wales Government Railways network at Albury, requiring a break-of-gauge to New South Wales' [...] (standard gauge). It was then followed in 1887 by a connection with the broad gauge South Australian Railways at Serviceton, with the Intercolonial Express (now The Overland) [...] to Adelaide running between the capitals. Additional trunk lines were also built though the 1870s, with rails extended to Sale, Portland and Colac; and the first branch lines built. It {{was a time of}} improved train safety, with the first <b>interlocking</b> of <b>railway</b> <b>signalling</b> to protect trains provided in 1874, and tests of continuous train brakes carried out in 1884.|$|R
40|$|Previous work {{carried out}} by the author (and many others) has {{involved}} the application of formal descriptions techniques to verifying the correctness of fixed block <b>railway</b> <b>signalling</b> systems. These systems are referred to as such because the railway is divided into sections of track, which are separated by signals. However, in the future, it will become increasingly the case that interlockings will not involve signals at all: safe distances will be kept between trains to avoid collisions (indicated to on-board systems via communication devices), but the railways of the future will not be separated into explicit sections of track as they are now. In this paper we investigate whether model checking techniques, which have previously been applied to fixed block systems, are also applicable to such moving block systems. 1 Introduction In [Sim 96], [SWD 97], and [Sim 98] an approach to verifying the safety of Geographic databases for Solid State <b>Interlocking</b> (SSI) <b>railway</b> <b>signal</b> [...] ...|$|R

50|$|A {{number of}} level {{crossings}} with the North Eastern Railway's Victoria Dock Branch Line {{and the line}} westwards out of Hull Paragon station caused delays to the trams. The crossings required catch points for the trams and <b>interlocking</b> with the <b>railway</b> <b>signalling</b> system. In 1925, the Corporation, Ministry of Transport and the NER's successor the London and North Eastern Railway proposed to eliminate the level crossings {{at a cost of}} £1¼ million, but no work was done until the 1960s. The last improvement to infrastructure came in 1931 with the building of the North Bridge in the town centre allowing trams to cross over the River Hull avoiding the narrow Drypool bridge.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} predictive diagnostic in high-power transformers. Particularly, this paper is focused on their use in uninterruptible power supply systems for safety critical applications, such as <b>railway</b> <b>interlocking</b> <b>signaling</b> installations. With respect {{to the state of}} the art, where typically only thermal and electrical faults are monitored, this work proposes a distributed network of measuring nodes where also vibration-based mechanical stress diagnosis is implemented. Mechanical degradation is tracked through vibration measures, using multichannel accelerometers, with sensitivity down to 0. 5 mg and local signal processing in the transformed frequency domain, up to 1 kHz. A compact hardware-software implementation of the nodes is also presented. The performances of the diagnostic system are assessed through experimental measurements on real three-phase high-power transformers used in railway applications...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, we {{investigate}} {{the applicability of}} the process algebraic formal method Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) [Hoa 85] to the development and analysis of safetycritical systems. We also investigate how these tasks might be aided by mechanical verification, which is provided {{in the form of the}} proof tool Failures-Divergences Refinement (FDR) [Ros 94]. Initially, we build upon the work of [RWW 94, Ros 95], in which CSP treatments of the security property of non-interference are described. We use one such formulation to define a property called protection, which unifies our views of safety and security. As well as applying protection to the analysis of safety-critical systems, we develop a proof system for this property, which in conjunction with the opportunity for automated analysis provided by FDR, enables us to apply the approach to problems of a sizable complexity. We then describe how FDR can be applied to the analysis of mutual exclusion, which is a specific form of non-interference. We investigate a number of well-known solutions to the problem, and illustrate how such mutual exclusion algorithms can be interpreted as CSP processes and verified with FDR. Furthermore, we develop a means of verifying the faulttolerance of such algorithms in terms of protection. In turn, mutual exclusion is used to describe safety properties of geographic data associated with Solid State <b>Interlocking</b> (SSI) <b>railway</b> <b>signalling</b> systems. We show how FDR can be used to describe these properties and model interlocking databases. The CSP approach to compositionality allows us to decompose such models, thus reducing the complexity of analysing safety invariants of SSI geographic data. As such, we describe how the mechanical verification of Solid State Interlocking geographic data, which was previously considered to be an intractable problem for the current generation of mechanical verification tools, is computationally feasible using FDR. Thus, the goals of this thesis are twofold. The first goal is to establish a formal encapsulation of a theory of safety-critical systems based upon the relationship which exists between safety and security. The second goal is to establish that CSP, together with FDR, can be applied to the modelling of Solid State Interlocking geographic databases. Furthermore, we shall attempt to demonstrate that such modelling can scale up to large-scale systems. </p...|$|R

Moreover, we investigated the correlation of lightning overvoltage (V) on signaling cables and rails with lightning conditions, such as the strike current (I) and the strike position (distance from the measuring position). From this we deduced the correlation between the lightning overvoltage (V) and (I), expressed as a linear expression. From this correlation, the lightning risk for <b>railway</b> <b>signaling</b> systems against lightning conditions can be estimated.
