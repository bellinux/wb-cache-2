A group of female academics interested in Deleuzian theories experimented with the salon to challenge presentation and dissemination norms that hierarchize and centralize the human. For Deleuze and Guattari (1987), assemblages are shifting and decentering, so how might assemblages of chairs, tables, bodies, lights, space, help to trouble {{thinking about the}} methodological conventions around academic disseminations? The authors discuss the salon as a critical-cultural site: Cumming presents Deleuze and play-dough, an exploration of how the playful <b>dissemination</b> <b>format</b> of the salon prompted a re-reading of a methodological vignette from earlier research.

40|$|TIPR, Towards Interoperable Preservation Repositories, is {{a project}} funded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services to create and test the Repository eXchange Package (RXP). The package will make it {{possible}} to transfer complex digital objects between dissimilar preservation repositories. For reasons of redundancy, succession planning and software migration, such repositories must be able to exchange copies of archival information packages with each other. Every different repository design, however, describes and structures its archival packages differently. Therefore each type produces dissemination packages that are rarely understandable or usable as submission packages by other repositories. The RXP is an answer to that mismatch. Other solutions for transferring packages between repositories focus either on transfers between repositories of the same type, such as DSpace-to-DSpace transfers, or on processes that translate a specific <b>dissemination</b> <b>format</b> into a specific submission package. Rather than build translators between many dissimilar repository types, the TIPR project has defined a standards-based package of metadata files that can act as an intermediary information package, the RXP, a lingua franca all repositories can read and write. In this paper we present the assumptions and principles underlying the TIPR concept of repository-to-repository exchange, and proceed to describe three aspects of the TIPR project: the RXP format itself; the tests we are conducting to prove and improve the use of the RXP; and finally, issues that have arisen {{in the course of the}} project so far...|$|E
40|$|GOLD, the General Ontology for Linguistic Description [1], has {{somewhat}} unexpectedly {{emerged from}} the EMELD project. Originally conceived of as a morphosyntactic annotation inventory and label mapping scheme, GOLD has now been formalized as an ontology by which disparate data sets can be integrated through a common representation of the basic linguistic features. The overall vision of the GOLD Community is that:"By agreeing on a shared ONTOLOGY of linguistic concepts and on a shared infrastructure for INTEROPERATION, the linguistics community {{will be able to}} produce RESOURCES that describe individual languages in a comparable way, to develop TOOLS that produce these comparable resources, and to query SERVICES that aggregate as many comparable resources as are available. " [2]In the EMELD context, a significant amount of effort has been invested in the development of GOLD in the first dimension of this vision, namely a shared collection of linguistic concepts. Initial surveying work been completed to glean linguistic concepts and their definitions from published materials. This survey work has been complemented by web data mining activities [3] to further increase the coverage of GOLD. GOLD has been instantiated in several formal versions, and a range of proof of concept implementations have featured at previous EMELD events [4, 5, 6] and other venues [7]. However the latter four items from the GOLD Community vision (to achieve interoperation through resources, tools, and services) remain largely unaddressed, and thus there remains considerable effort to be expended in achieving the vision in its entirity. Upon reflection, we believe that there are presently three significant barriers to the widespread adoption of GOLD and subsequent realization of the interoperation goals, vis: * the complexity of the <b>dissemination</b> <b>format</b> which in effect places the threshold for engagement with GOLD at too high a level; * the absence of a well defined change processJune 2006 Open Acces...|$|E

40|$|Droughts are {{the most}} common type of natural {{disaster}} in Africa and the problem is compounded by their complexity. The agriculture sector still forms the backbone of most economies in Africa, with 70 % of output being derived from rain-fed smallscale farming; this sector is the first casualty of droughts. Accurate, timely and relevant drought predication information enables a community to anticipate and prepare for droughts and hence minimize the negative impacts. Current weather forecasts are still alien to African farmers, most of whom live in rural areas and struggle with illiteracy and poor communications infrastructure. However, these farmers hold indigenous knowledge not only on how to predict droughts, but also on unique coping strategies. Adoption of wireless sensor networks and mobile phones to provide a bridge between scientific and indigenous knowledge of weather forecasting methods is one way of ensuring that the content of forecasts and the <b>dissemination</b> <b>formats</b> meet local needs.

General issues The dual role of the new Manual was discussed once again. It was recognised that the manual would have at least two audiences – it should represent a reference document on CPI theory and practice for all compilers and users of CPIs and a practical guidebook and manual for practitioners not only from developing countries but also from developed countries. Therefore, several participants thought that a high degree of readability must be ensured and maintained throughout the Manual in order to preserve readership.

40|$|Progressive {{research}} dissemination {{is gaining}} prominence in academia {{in a rapidly}} modernized society with an increasing emphasis on translation of research findings. It has become imperative to explore alternative ways in which research progress can be communicated {{to the public and}} policy makers. The aim of this pilot research study is twofold. Firstly, to identify some of the basic limitations of traditional research reporting formats and secondly, to explore the potential of alternative or progressive <b>formats</b> of <b>dissemination</b> of research findings. By reviewing relevant literature and qualitatively exploring the experiences of researchers involved in disseminating research in progressive formats, we identify the challenges and opportunities at stake for the researchers themselves as well as the recipients of their work. Seven semi-structured interviews with researchers from mixed academic backgrounds were carried out. A thematic analysis approach was used to probe further into the data. The study showed that a number of competences including seeing one’s research from a new perspective, learning to communicate differently to various audiences, utilizing communication tools to invite the public into one’s research domain, networking and collaboration amongst the benefits of engaging in progressive <b>dissemination</b> <b>formats.</b> Challenges included time constraints, lack of interest from academic communities, minimizing career prospects in academia as well as potential evaluation challenges.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Clinical {{guidelines}} (CGs) {{are popular}} for healthcare decision making but their acceptability and use by healthcare providers {{is influenced by}} numerous factors. Some of these factors are professional-related, such as knowledge and perceptions of and attitudes toward CGs in general. The aim of our study was to evaluate attitudes and perceptions of Spanish physicians towards CGs. METHODS: We coordinated six discussion groups {{with a total of}} 46 physicians. The participants were drawn from 12 medical specialties from both specialized and primary care. We recorded the sessions and transcribed the content verbatim. We analyzed the data using an approach based on the grounded theory. RESULTS: We identified two main constructs that defined the physicians' perceptions towards guidelines: knowledge and usefulness. "Knowledge" defined the theoretical meanings of guidelines, while "Usefulness" referred to the pragmatic approach to guidelines. These constructs were interrelated through a series of categories such as confidence, usability, accessibility, <b>dissemination</b> and <b>formats.</b> CONCLUSIONS: In our study, the constructs that impacted most on physician's attitudes to clinical guidelines were knowledge and usefulness. The tension between the theoretical and the pragmatic constructs determined the attitudes and how physicians use guidelines.

40|$|Abstract Background Family {{physicians}} (FPs) play {{an important}} role in cancer control. While FPs' attitudes towards, and use of guidelines in general have been explored, no study has looked at the needs of FPs with respect to guidelines for the continuum of cancer control. The objective of this study was to understand which guideline topics FPs consider important. Methods Five group interviews were conducted by telephone with FPs from across Ontario, Canada. Transcripts were analyzed inductively. Content analysis identified emergent themes. Themes are illustrated by representative quotes taken from the transcripts. Results The main areas where FPs felt guidelines were needed most included screening – a traditional area of responsibility for FPs – and treatment and follow-up – areas where they felt they lacked the knowledge to best support patients. Confusion over best practice when faced with conflicting guidelines varied according to disease site. FPs defined good guideline formats; the most often cited forms of presentation were tear-off sheets to use interactively with patients, or a binder. Computer-based dissemination was acknowledged as the best way of widely distributing material that needs frequent updates. However, until computer use is a common aspect of practice, mail was considered the most viable method of dissemination. Guidelines designed for use by patients were supported by FPs. Conclusions Preferred guideline topics, <b>format,</b> <b>dissemination</b> methods and role of patient guidelines identified by FPs in this study reflect the nature of their practice situations. Guideline developers and those supporting use of evidence-based guidelines (e. g., Canadian Strategy for Cancer Control) have a responsibility to ensure that FPs are provided with the resources they identify as important, and to provide them in a format that will best support their use. </p...|$|R
