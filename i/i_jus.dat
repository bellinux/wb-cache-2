40|$|We shall {{introduce}} the relatively countably n-paracompactness {{in a total}} space (n = 1, 2, 3) and discuss the relations among another relative properties, and also give their characterizations. AMS subject classification: 54 A 20, 54 D 55 In many areas of general topology, we must study the following problem: Let Y be a given space. If Y is embedded in a larger space X, how is Y located in X? It goes without saying that, when Y coincides with the larger space X, the relative property 〓 must coincide with the topological property 〓 of the space Y. The first systematic exposition of relative topological versions appeared in A. V. Arhangel'skii and H. M. M. Genedi [3] in 1989. They discussed fundamental properties like example relative Hausdorff, relative regularity and relative compactness type properites etc. and posed some open questions. Some years ago, A. V. Arhangel'skii [2] also gave valuable surveys and many important results on relative topological properties and relative topological spaces. So this provides us with a guideline in our work on relative versions. Some new results on relative normality and relative paracompactness were obtained by <b>I.</b> <b>Ju.</b> Gordienko [8, 9] and K.

40|$|Studies {{have been}} {{performed}} on how the Lithuanian language and its varieties are spoken and maintained by migrants living abroad {{as well as on}} how the standard language ideology affects the speakers of regional varieties in Lithuania. However, what is lacking, is investigations on whether and how the Lithuanian standard language ideology affects regional variety speakers who live in foreign countries. Therefore, this research tries to bridge the existing gap between previous studies by analysing Lithuanian Samogitian migrants’ attitudes towards their regional variety, the main factors that might influence such opinions and whether the standard language ideology is one of these factors. The study analyses audio-recorded and coded in-depth interview responses by 10 Lithuanian Samogitians, currently living in various places in Germany. The in-depth analysis of the interview responses has shown that in migration, similarly as in Lithuania, people’s attitudes towards Samogitian and the usage of it are governed by the three main factors, namely education, Soviet language policy and the linguistic pressure from society. Qualities such as the pressure to speak the “right” way, the choice to use one variety over the other believing that it is common sense or thinking that the “wrong” variety is of low prestige and those who speak it are incompetent, lead to what {{is referred to as the}} ideology of the standard language. Even though migrants do not feel intense pressure to speak the “right” language and feel much freer to use the variety of their choice when talking to other migrants, they still believe that it is common sense to use the standard in official gatherings, for public speeches or for official events. This observation leads to a conclusion that migrants’ attitudes towards their regional variety are governed by the standard Lithuanian language ideology. However, even though the ideology of the standard still plays a significant role in governing migrants’ attitudes towards the usage of Samogitian, the influence is, for sure, lesser than on those who live in Lithuania.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Psychology's {{conceptualization}} of anorexia nervosa illustrates how the discipline {{deals with the}} body. On the one hand, there is {{an emphasis on the}} body as a physiological apparatus. On the other hand, specific approaches such as social constructionism stress the non-physiological body as something to which certain discursive meanings get attached. We propose to view the body as a producer of meaning in its own right, as a 'selfing device'. To this end we emphasize bodily communi-cation as a continuous flow of co-regulated interaction. The body presents itself as the natural juncture of 'co-regulative skills'. The 'selfing process' involves multiple stylized bodily skills that testify to people's ability {{to take part in the}} life-world. Anorexia is seen as a disturbance of those skills.

Income differentials, the level of development and the demographic struc-ture of the population play a significant role in the determination of the rate of immigration for the countries in our sample. However, we also find evidence of an important influence of institutions, and in particular migration policy, since countries with a more open citizenship policy display higher migration rates after controlling for standard economic factors.

A largely neglected question is whether CSR impacts positively on society. We address this gap in the literature by exploring the relationship between CSR adoption (as reflected by corporate declarations to adopt CSR policies) and corporate involvement in alleged human rights abuses. Using information on 140 large advanced country corporations, we find that there is a relationship between CSR and alleged human rights abuses, but that the nature of this relationship varies according to the type of abuse: firms that declare to be CSR-adopters appear less likely to be involved than non-adopters in the worst of the abuses (<b>i.</b> e. <b>jus</b> cogens abuses), but more likely than non-adopters to be involved in other types of “less serious ” abuse (i. e. no–jus cogens abuses).

Since the International Court of Justice did not rule {{on the question of}} the legal character of the reparation obligation following a breach of jus cogens, and since the question is, in the actual state of international law, still open in the view of the author, this thesis aims to take a closer view on the question. It discusses the question if jus cogens is more of a natural law character or more of a constitutional law character. Moreover, it discusses arguments such as the "waiver right" of an injured State, the necessary link between the specific obligation breached and the following content of the reparation obligation, the classical law on State responsibility as well as the distinction between "primary" and "secondary" obligation...|$|R
40|$|Kauno Romainių tuberkuliozės ligoninėje 1997 - 2001 m. buvo ištirti 2439 ligoniai dėl atsparumo vaistams nuo tuberkuliozės. <b>Iš</b> <b>jų</b> 838 tuberkuliozė diagnozuota pirmą kartą (jie negydyti ar gydyti trumpiau kaip mėnesį), 1601 - 9 ̆ 6 tuberkuliozė nustatyta seniai (nesėkmės, atkryčiai, gydyti ilgiau kaip mėnesį). Ištirtas atsparumas izoniazidui, rifampicinui, etambutoliui, streptomicinui ir dauginis atsparumas vaistams. Paaiškėjo, kad tarp ligonių, kuriems tuberkuliozė diagnozuota pirmą kartą, mikobakterijų atsparumas vaistams sumažėjęs. Atsparumas izoniazidui 1997 m. buvo 27, 5 proc., tačiau ryškiai sumažėjo 1999 m. 9 ̆ 6 - 7, 6 proc., 2000 m. - 9 ̆ 6 5, 3 proc. ir 2001 m. - 9 ̆ 6 8, 7 proc. Atsparumas rifampicinui 1997 m. buvo 19, 9 proc., 1998 m. 9 ̆ 6 9, 0 proc., 1999 m. 9 ̆ 6 1, 9 proc. 2000 ir 2001 m. atsparumo rifampicinui tarp ligonių, kuriems pirmą kartą diagnozuota tuberkuliozė, nenustatyta. Atsparumas etambutoliui 1997 m. buvo 1, 1 proc., 1998 m. - 9 ̆ 61, 5 proc., 19999 ̆ 6 - 2001 m. atsparumo etambutoliui nenustatyta. Atsparumas streptomicinui 1997 m. buvo 15, 6 proc., 1998 m. 9 ̆ 6 - 26, 3 proc. ir žymiai sumažėjo 1999 m. - 9 ̆ 6 iki 3, 2 proc., 2000 m. 9 ̆ 6 - 1, 8 proc. Two thausand {{four hundred}} thirty nine cases of {{tuberculosis}} were {{confirmed by the}} method of culture of the sputum at Kaunas Romainiai tuberculosis hospital {{during the period of}} 19979 ̆ 62001. Out of them, 669 of them were diagnozed for the first time (not treated or treated for less than 1 month). Out of confirmed cases, 1601 of confirmed cases were the 9 ̆ 3 old 9 ̆ 4 ones (treatment failures, relapses, treated with one or two courses of antimicrobial therapy). The resistance to H, R, E, S and multidrug resistance have been investigated. We have revealed that among the 9 ̆ 3 new 9 ̆ 4 cases of tuberculosis the resistance of M. tuberculosis has decreased. In 1997 the resistance to H was 27. 5 percent. However, it decreased 5. 3 percent in 2000 and to 8. 7 percent in 2001. In 1997 the resistance to R was 19. 9 percent and it has decreased to 9. 0 percent and 1. 9 percent in 1998 and 1999, respectively. No R resistance cases were diagnozed in 2000 and 2001. In 1997 the resistance to E was 1. 1 percent. It reached 1. 5 percent in 1998 and there was no resistance to E in 19999 ̆ 62001. In 1997 the resistance to S was 15. 6 percent. In 1998 it was 26. 3 percent and dropped to 1. 8 percent in 2000...|$|R
