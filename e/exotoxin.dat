25|$|P. aeruginosa {{uses the}} {{virulence}} factor <b>exotoxin</b> A to inactivate eukaryotic elongation factor 2 via ADP-ribosylation {{in the host}} cell, much as the diphtheria toxin does. Without elongation factor 2, eukaryotic cells cannot synthesize proteins and necrotise. The release of intracellular contents induces an immunologic response in immunocompetent patients.|$|E
50|$|The {{syndrome}} is induced by epidermolytic <b>exotoxins</b> (exfoliatin) A and B, which are released by S. aureus and cause detachment within the epidermal layer, by {{breaking down the}} desmosomes. One of the <b>exotoxins</b> is encoded on the bacterial chromosome, while the other is encoded on a plasmid. These <b>exotoxins</b> are proteases that cleave desmoglein-1, which normally holds the granulosum and spinosum layers together.|$|R
40|$|Several {{observations}} {{suggest that}} staphylococcal enterotoxins A, B and C (SEA, SEB and SEC, respectively), {{in addition to}} toxic shock syndrome toxin- 1 (TSST- 1), are causative <b>exotoxins</b> of toxic shock syndrome (TSS). Based on the view that polyclonal T cell activation with the causative <b>exotoxins,</b> resulting in over-production of lymphokines, {{is involved in the}} development of the pathological changes observed in TSS, we investigated the activities of these four <b>exotoxins</b> to induce proliferation and interleukin 2 production in murine and human lymphocytes by using in vitro culture systems. The results showed that all these <b>exotoxins</b> are strong polyclonal inducers of proliferation and interleukin 2 production in human T cells, whereas TSST- 1 and SEA are strong and SEB and SEC are weak polyclonal inducers in murine T cells. These results suggest that SEA, SEB and SEC, in addition to TSST- 1, are possibly involved as causative <b>exotoxins</b> {{in the development of the}} pathological changes observed in TSS...|$|R
50|$|<b>Exotoxins</b> are {{actively}} secreted by some bacteria {{and have a}} wide range of effects including inhibition of certain biochemical pathways in the host. The two most potent known <b>exotoxins</b> are the tetanus toxin (tetanospasmin) secreted by Clostridium tetani and the botulinum toxin secreted by Clostridium botulinum. <b>Exotoxins</b> are also produced by a range of other bacteria including Escherichia coli; Vibrio cholerae (causative agent of cholera); Clostridium perfringens (common causative agent of food poisoning as well as gas gangrene) and Clostridium difficile (causative agent of pseudomembranous colitis). A potent three-protein virulence factor produced by Bacillus anthracis, called anthrax toxin, {{plays a key role in}} anthrax pathogenesis. <b>Exotoxins</b> are extremely immunogenic meaning that they trigger the humoral response (antibodies target the toxin).|$|R
25|$|Researchers have {{actively}} {{been working}} to develop safe, effective vaccines to lower the worldwide incidence of E. coli infection. In March 2006, a vaccine eliciting an immune response against the E. coli O157:H7 O-specific polysaccharide conjugated to recombinant <b>exotoxin</b> A of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (O157-rEPA) {{was reported to be}} safe in children two to five years old. Previous work had already indicated it was safe for adults. A phase III clinical trial to verify the large-scale efficacy of the treatment is planned.|$|E
25|$|Tetanus toxin is {{a potent}} neurotoxin. On the basis of weight, tetanospasmin {{is one of the}} most potent toxins known (based on tests {{conducted}} on mice). The estimated minimum human lethal dose is 2.5 nanograms per kilogram of body weight, or 175 nanograms in a 70kg (154lb) human. The only toxins more lethal to mice are botulinum toxin, produced by close relative Clostridium botulinum and the <b>exotoxin</b> produced by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, the causative agent of diphtheria. It should be noted, however, that humans and other animals may react to specific toxins differently from mice, and that the overall lethality of a specific toxin likely varies between different animals.|$|E
25|$|Anthrax toxin is a three-protein <b>exotoxin</b> {{secreted}} by virulent {{strains of}} the bacterium, Bacillus anthracis—the causative agent of anthrax. The toxin was first discovered by Harry Smith in 1954. Anthrax toxin is composed of a cell-binding protein, known as protective antigen (PA), and two enzyme components, called edema factor (EF) and lethal factor (LF). These three protein components act together to impart their physiological effects. Assembled complexes containing the toxin components are endocytosed. In the endosome, the enzymatic components of the toxin translocate into the cytoplasm of a target cell. Once in the cytosol, the enzymatic components of the toxin disrupts various immune cell functions, namely cellular signaling and cell migration. The toxin may even induce cell lysis, as is observed for macrophage cells. Anthrax toxin allows the bacteria to evade the immune system, proliferate, and ultimately kill the host animal. Research on anthrax toxin also provides insight into the generation of macromolecular assemblies, and on protein translocation, pore formation, endocytosis, and other biochemical processes.|$|E
5000|$|Once in the cell, {{many of the}} <b>exotoxins</b> act at the {{eukaryotic}} ribosomes (especially 60S), as {{protein synthesis}} inhibitors. (Ribosome structure {{is one of the}} most important differences between eukaryotes and prokaryotes, and, in a sense, these <b>exotoxins</b> are the bacterial equivalent of antibiotics such as clindamycin.) ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Exotoxins</b> are {{susceptible}} to antibodies produced by the immune system, but many <b>exotoxins</b> are so toxic {{that they may be}} fatal to the host before the immune system has a chance to mount defenses against them. For this reason antitoxin, anti-serum containing antibodies, is injected to provide passive immunity.|$|R
50|$|Common {{sources of}} bioaerosols include soil, water, and sewage. Bioaerosols can {{transmit}} microbial pathogens, endotoxins, and allergens and can excrete both endotoxins and <b>exotoxins.</b> <b>Exotoxins</b> {{can be particularly}} dangerous when transported {{through the air and}} distribute pathogens to which humans are sensitive. Cyanobacteria are particularly prolific in their pathogen distribution and are abundant in both terrestrial and aquatic environments.|$|R
25|$|Beta {{hemolysis}} (β-hemolysis), {{sometimes called}} complete hemolysis, {{is a complete}} lysis of red cells in the media around and under the colonies: the area appears lightened (yellow) and transparent. Streptolysin, an <b>exotoxin,</b> is the enzyme produced by the bacteria which causes the complete lysis of red blood cells. There {{are two types of}} streptolysin: Streptolysin O (SLO) and streptolysin S (SLS). Streptolysin O is an oxygen-sensitive cytotoxin, secreted by most Group A streptococcus (GAS), and interacts with cholesterol in the membrane of eukaryotic cells (mainly red and white blood cells, macrophages, and platelets), and usually results in β-hemolysis under the surface of blood agar. Streptolysin S is an oxygen-stable cytotoxin also produced by most GAS strains which results in clearing on the surface of blood agar. SLS affects immune cells, including polymorphonuclear leukocytes and lymphocytes, and is thought to prevent the host immune system from clearing infection. Streptococcus pyogenes, or group A Streptococcus (GAS), displays beta hemolysis.|$|E
500|$|RosettaDock {{was added}} to the Rosetta {{software}} suite during the first CAPRI experiment in 2002 as the Baker laboratory's algorithm for protein–protein docking prediction. In that experiment, RosettaDock made a high-accuracy prediction for the docking between streptococcal pyogenic <b>exotoxin</b> A and a T cell-receptor β-chain, and a medium accuracy prediction for a complex between porcine α-amylase and a camelid antibody. [...] While the RosettaDock method only made two acceptably accurate predictions out of seven possible, this was enough to rank it seventh out of nineteen prediction methods in the first CAPRI assessment.|$|E

40|$|Proinflammatory cytokines {{mediate the}} toxic effect of superantigenic staphylococcal <b>exotoxins</b> (SE). Doxy-cycline {{inhibited}} SE-stimulated T-cell proliferation {{and production of}} cytokines and chemokines by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These {{results suggest that the}} antibiotic doxycycline has anti-inflamma-tory effects and is therapeutically useful for mitigating the pathogenic effects of SE. Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST- 1) and the structurally related <b>exotoxins</b> are bacterial <b>exotoxins</b> that bind directly to major histocompatibility complex class II mol-ecules on antigen-presenting cells (1, 5, 8, 18, 23) and activate T cells expressing specific V elements (7). These toxins are called superantigens because of their ability to polyclonally stimulate large populations of T cells (1, 4, 7, 14). Thus, staph-ylococcal <b>exotoxins</b> (SE) are potent activators of the immune system and cause a variety of diseases in humans, including food poisoning, toxic shock, and autoimmune diseases (1, 2, 6, 12, 14, 22).

40|$|No sponsorships or {{competing}} interests have been disclosed for this article. Objective. Staphylococcal <b>exotoxins</b> {{have been reported}} in the pathogenesis of many chronic inflammatory diseases. Recent reports have hypothesized that staphylococcal <b>exotoxins</b> might be related to inflammatory mucosal changes seen in chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps (CRS-NPs). Staphylococcal <b>exotoxins</b> have the capacity to act as superantigens (SAgs), bypassing normal antigen processing and directly stimulating a massive inflammatory response. The objective of this study was to analyze polyp tissue samples from patients with antro-choanal polyps (ACPs) and CRS-NPs for the presence of sta-phylococcal <b>exotoxins.</b> Study Design. Prospective cohort study. Setting. Tertiary medical center. Subjects and Methods. Tissue samples were obtained from 29 patients and 16 controls. Thirteen of 29 patients had ACPs, and 16 had CRS-NPs. Specimens were analyzed for the presence of 5 staphylococcal <b>exotoxins</b> (SEA, SEB, SEC, SED, and toxic shock syndrome toxin– 1) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results. At least 1 toxin was detected in 7 of 13 patients with ACPs and in 13 of 16 patients with CRS-NPs, whereas it was detected in only 4 controls. There were no statisti-cally significant differences between ACP and control groups (P =. 063). Our results showed a statistically significant asso-ciation between toxin detection and patients with CRS-NPs (P =. 003). Conclusion. Inflammatory triggers in ACP remain a subject of debate, and this study does not support the hypothesis that staphylococcal <b>exotoxins</b> may play a role in ACP ethiopatho-genesis. Our research is consistent with the possibility of SAgs as etiological agents in the development of bilateral nasal polyposis...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. May 2015. Major: Pharmacology. Advisor: Marnie Peterson. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xiv, 227 pages. Staphylococcus aureus {{is a major}} human pathogen capable of infecting nearly every tissue and causing {{a wide range of}} disease including skin and soft tissue infections, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, and toxic shock syndrome. S. aureus produces an array of <b>exotoxins</b> including superantigens and cytolysins, which contribute directly to disease by causing inflammation, immune evasion, and tissue damage. Recent evidence also suggests that superantigens and cytolysins modulate host epithelial cell signaling at mucosal surfaces and contribute directly to disease progression. Antibiotics can eliminate S. aureus, but have no effect on <b>exotoxins</b> already present within tissues. In addition, antibiotic resistance continues to increase in strains of S. aureus. Therefore, I hypothesize that anti-staphylococcal therapies, which target <b>exotoxins</b> or the down-stream host responses to <b>exotoxins,</b> should be explored to treat or prevent S. aureus infections. In this study, I investigated the mechanism of action of the superantigen, Toxic Shock Syndrome Toxin (TSST) - 1, and the cytolysins, alpha-toxin and gamma-toxin, at the vaginal mucosal surface. Historically, TSST- 1 was determined to promote disease (toxic shock syndrome) by widespread activation of CD 4 + T-cells and antigen-presenting cells. However, recently, TSST- 1 was determined to have direct proinflammatory effects on vaginal epithelial cells through an epidermal growth factor receptor-dependent pathway. Alpha-toxin’s mechanism of action and synergy with TSST- 1 at the vaginal mucosa was characterized using in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo models. Furthermore, novel actions of gamma-toxin at the vaginal mucosa were identified and the mechanism of action characterized. From this work, I proposed a model of cell-signaling by TSST- 1, alpha-toxin, and gamma-toxin at the vaginal mucosa, which demonstrates a conserved proinflammatory and immune-modulating effect by S. aureus <b>exotoxins.</b> Proof of concept was established for two novel therapies for prevention and treatment of S. aureus infections. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor, AG 1478, which inhibits the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway, inhibited cytokine production induced by TSST- 1, alpha-toxin, and gamma-toxin at the vaginal mucosa and prevented lethal menstrual toxic shock syndrome in rabbits challenged with live S. aureus. In addition, a vaccine targeting multiple <b>exotoxins</b> of S. aureus was highly effective in preventing lethal intrapulmonary challenge {{with a wide range of}} clinical strains and for treatment of the lethal effects of <b>exotoxins</b> in rabbits. In summary, these studies describe the mechanism of action of multiple S. aureus <b>exotoxins</b> and provide proof of concept for targeting <b>exotoxins</b> for treatment or prevention of toxin-mediated diseases. These studies demonstrate the importance of local proinflammatory effects during S. aureus infections, which contribute directly to the initiation of clinical disease. The data further highlight the importance of <b>exotoxins</b> during disease and add both insight and complexity to the field of S. aureus pathogenesis...|$|R
