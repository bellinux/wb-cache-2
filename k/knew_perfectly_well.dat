500|$|Mersey Beat founder Bill Harry later repudiated {{the story}} about Epstein not knowing who the Beatles were, as Harry {{had been talking to}} Epstein about the band for a long time (being the group he {{promoted}} the most in Mersey Beat) and by McCartney saying, “Brian [...] <b>knew</b> <b>perfectly</b> <b>well</b> who the Beatles were, they were {{on the front page of}} the second issue of Mersey Beat.” Regardless, the interest in the record eventually led Epstein to make his way to the Cavern with Taylor, during lunch hour on 9 November 1961. He was initially repelled by the dark, damp club, but he congratulated them on their performance.|$|E
500|$|Epstein saw {{numerous}} posters around Liverpool advertising concerts by the Beatles {{as well as}} in {{the second}} issue of Mersey Beat, which had [...] "Beatles sign Recording Contract!" [...] on the front cover, as the Beatles had recorded the [...] "My Bonnie" [...] single with Tony Sheridan in Germany. Some months after its release, Epstein supposedly (as stated in his biography), asked his assistant Alistair Taylor about the single, because a customer, one Raymond Jones, had asked Epstein for the single on 28 October 1961, which made Epstein curious about the group. Harry and McCartney repudiated this story, as Harry had been talking to Epstein about the Beatles for a long time (being the group he promoted the most in Mersey Beat), and by McCartney saying, [...] "Brian [...] <b>knew</b> <b>perfectly</b> <b>well</b> who the Beatles were, they were on the front page of the second issue of Mersey Beat." ...|$|E
500|$|Epstein's {{version of}} the story was that {{customer}} Raymond Jones walked into the NEMS shop and asked him for the [...] "My Bonnie" [...] single, which made Epstein curious about the group. Taylor later claimed that he had used the name of Jones (a regular customer) to order the single and paid the deposit, knowing that Epstein would notice it and order further copies. Harry and McCartney later repudiated Epstein's story, as Harry had been talking to Epstein for a long time about the Beatles—the group that he promoted the most in Mersey Beat—with McCartney saying, [...] "Brian [...] <b>knew</b> <b>perfectly</b> <b>well</b> who the Beatles were; they were {{on the front page of}} the second issue of Mersey Beat". On 3 August 1961, Epstein started a regular music column in the Mersey Beat called [...] "Stop the World—And Listen To Everything In It: Brian Epstein of NEMS".|$|E

500|$|Despite {{these recent}} developments, Larkin and his circle are {{nonetheless}} still firmly rejected by modernist critics and poets. For example, the poet Andrew Duncan, writing of The Movement on his pinko.org website, notes that [...] "there {{now seems to}} be a very wide consensus that it was a bad thing, and that Movement poems are tedious, shallow, smug, sententious, emotionally dead, etc. Their successors in the mainstream retain most of these characteristics. Wolfgang Gortschacher's book on Little Magazine Profiles ... shows ... that there was a terrific dearth of magazines during the 50s—an impoverishment of openings which correlates with rigid and conservative poetry, and with the hegemony of a few people determined to exclude dissidents." [...] Peter Riley, a key player in the British Poetry Revival, which was a reaction against The Movement's poets, has also criticised Larkin for his uncritical and ideologically narrow position: [...] "What after all were Larkin and The Movement but a denial of the effusive ethics of poetry from 1795 onwards, in favour of 'This is what life is really like' as if anyone thought for a second of representing observable 'life'. W.S. Graham and Dylan Thomas <b>knew</b> <b>perfectly</b> <b>well</b> that 'life' was like that, if you nominated it thus, which is why they went elsewhere." ...|$|E
2500|$|Having read Westropp, Sir John <b>knew</b> <b>perfectly</b> <b>well</b> {{that all}} the former's Mesolithic {{implements}} were surface finds. He used his prestige to quell the concept of Mesolithic as best he could, but the public could see that his methods were not typological. The less prestigious scientists publishing in the smaller journals continued {{to look for a}} Mesolithic. For example, Isaac Taylor in The Origin of the Aryans, 1889, mentions the Mesolithic but briefly, asserting, however, that it formed [...] "a transition between the Palaeolithic and Neolithic Periods." [...] Nevertheless, Sir John fought on, opposing the Mesolithic by name as late as the 1897 edition of his work.|$|E
2500|$|Brando made {{a similar}} comment on Larry King Live in April 1996, saying [...] "Hollywood is run by Jews; it is owned by Jews, {{and they should have}} a greater {{sensitivity}} about the issue of—of people who are suffering. Because they've exploited—we have seen the—we have seen the nigger and greaseball, we've seen the chink, we've seen the slit-eyed dangerous Jap, we have seen the wily Filipino, we've seen everything, but we never saw the kike. Because they <b>knew</b> <b>perfectly</b> <b>well,</b> that that is where you draw the wagons around." [...] Larry King, who is Jewish, replied, [...] "When you say—when you say something like that, you are playing right in, though, to anti-Semitic people who say the Jews are—" [...] Brando interrupted: [...] "No, no, because I will be the first one who will appraise the Jews honestly and say 'Thank God for the Jews'." ...|$|E

2500|$|On Monday, 7 May 1694, Admiral O'Byrne was {{scheduled}} to sleep ashore, which gave the men the opportunity they were looking for. At approximately 9:00p.m., Every and about twenty-five other men rushed aboard the Charles II and surprised the crew on board. Captain Gibson was bedridden at the time, so the mutiny ended bloodlessly. One account states that the extra men from the James pulled up in a longboat beside the ship and gave the password, saying, [...] "Is the drunken boatswain on board?" [...] before joining in the mutiny. Captain Humphreys of the James is also said to have called out to Every that the men were deserting, to which Every calmly replied that he <b>knew</b> <b>perfectly</b> <b>well.</b> The James then fired on the Charles II, alerting the Spanish Night Watch, and Every was forced {{to make a run}} to the open sea, quickly vanishing into the night.|$|E
2500|$|Puyi came to Beijing on 9 December 1959 {{with special}} {{permission}} from Mao Zedong and lived {{for the next}} six months in an ordinary Beijing residence with his sister before being transferred to a government-sponsored hotel. Puyi had the job of sweeping the streets, and got lost on his first day of work, which led him to tell astonished passers-by: [...] "I'm Puyi, the last Emperor of the Qing dynasty. I'm staying with relatives and can't find my way home". One of Puyi's first acts upon returning to Beijing was to visit the Forbidden City as a tourist, where he pointed out to other tourists that many of the exhibits were the things he had used in his youth. He voiced his support for the Communists and worked at the Beijing Botanical Gardens. Working as a simple gardener gave Puyi a degree of happiness that he had never known as an emperor, though he was notably clumsy. Behr noted that in Europe people who played roles analogous to the role Puyi played in Manchukuo were generally executed; for example, the British hanged William Joyce ("Lord Haw-haw") only for being the announcer on the English-language broadcasts of Radio Berlin, Italian Communist guerrillas shot Benito Mussolini, and the French executed Pierre Laval, so many Westerners are surprised that Puyi was released from prison after only nine years to start a new life. Behr wrote that the Communist ideology explained this difference, writing: [...] "In a society where all landlord and 'capitalist-roaders' were evil incarnate, it did not matter so much that Puyi was also a traitor to his country: he was, in the eyes of the Communist ideologues, only behaving true to type. If all capitalists and landlords were, by their very nature, traitors, it was only logical that Puyi, the biggest landlord, should also be the biggest traitor. And, in the last resort, Puyi was far more valuable alive than dead". In early 1960, Puyi met Premier Zhou Enlai, who told him: [...] "You weren't responsible for becoming Emperor at the age of three or the 1917 attempted restoration coup. But you were fully to blame for what happened later. You <b>knew</b> <b>perfectly</b> <b>well</b> what you were doing when you took refuge in the Legation Quarter, when you traveled under Japanese protection to Tianjin, and when you agreed to become Manchukuo Chief Executive." [...] Puyi responded by merely saying that though he did not choose to be an emperor, he had behaved with savage cruelty as boy-emperor and wished he could apologize to all of the eunuchs he had flogged during his youth.|$|E
