Due to modeling the tolerances, a code is written in MATLAB 2013 software that produces deviated points. Deviated points are controlled by different <b>geometric</b> <b>tolerances,</b> including cylindricity, total run-out and coaxiality tolerances. Final surfaces and models passing through the points are created using SolidWorks 2013 software and finally modal analysis is carried out with the FE software. It is observed whatever the natural frequency is higher or the <b>geometric</b> <b>tolerances</b> are greater, the real and ideal shafts natural frequencies are more distant.

40|$|AbstractMonte-Carlo {{simulation}} is {{the most}} popular and simplest method for nonlinear statistical tolerance analysis. Random values for every part are got according to the part distributions, and the value of the response function is computed for each set of part values.

Atpresent, the researches on assembly tolerance analysis have been focused on dimension tolerance and hardly take <b>geometric</b> <b>tolerance</b> intoconsideration. In this paper, <b>geometric</b> <b>tolerance</b> is treated as dimension tolerance whose nominal value is zero, and the Monte Carlo SimulationMethod is applied to tolerance analysis including <b>geometric</b> <b>tolerance.</b> Finally, a case of a top column assembly verifies the validity and accuracy of the method...|$|E

40|$|An {{image is}} never noise free. Visual {{inspection}} {{of a part}} from its image is therefore affected by image errors. Understanding how image errors affect measurement precision is therefore critical for accurate inspection. Existing visual inspection methods either setup a highly controlled environment to minimize image errors or simply ignore image errors. They therefore suffer from limited accuracy and lack of robustness. In this paper, we lay out a statistical framework that allows to explicitly handle image errors and characterize their impact on measurement precision. A hierarchical model is also proposed to model manufacturing and measurement errors. Based on the model, a Bayesian technique is introduced to statistically infer the <b>geometric</b> <b>tolerances</b> of a manufactured part. 1.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{unstructured}} triangular mesh generation algorithm that approximates {{a set of}} mutually nonintersecting simple trimmed polynomial parametric surface patches within a user specified <b>geometric</b> <b>tolerance.</b> The proposed method uses numerically robust interval geometric representations/computations and also addresses the problem of topological consistency (homeomorphism) between the exact geometry and its approximation. Those {{are among the most}} important outstanding issues in geometry approximation problems. We also extract important differential geometric features of input geometry for use in the approximation. Our surface tessellation algorithm is based on the unstructured Delaunay mesh approach which leads to an efficient adaptive triangulation. A robust decision criterion is introduced to prevent possible failures in the conventional Delaunay triangulation. To satisfy the prescribed <b>geometric</b> <b>tolerance,</b> an adaptive node insertion algorithm is employed and furthermore, an efficient method to compute a tight upper bound of the approximation error is proposed. Unstructured triangular meshes for free-form surfaces frequently involve triangles with high aspect ratio and, accordingly, result in ill-conditioned meshing. Our proposed algorithm constructs 2 D triangulation domains which sufficiently preserve the shape of triangles when mapped into 3 D space and, furthermore, the algorithm provides an efficient method that explicitly controls the aspect ratio of the triangular elements...|$|E

We show that the meaning of the <b>geometric</b> <b>tolerances</b> can be defined thanks to a model of virtual gauges. These gauges concern geometrical entities of the part which are represented on the three-dimensional geometrical model of the part (CAD model). The topology of a gauge is related to that of the part. Recording these attributes is sufficient. The advantages of this representation are its simplicity, the semantic coherence which can be guaranteed, the independence from the standards, their limits and their evolutions, and the extension of the tolerancing possibilities for the designer...|$|R
40|$|The use of intensity-modulated {{radiation}} therapy (IMRT) {{has led to}} {{an increase in the number}} of complex fields that require measurement and comparison to calculated dose distributions in 2 D. Current dose evaluation techniques, including isodose line comparisons, displays of the dose difference between calculated and measured distributions, and distance-to-agreement (DTA) comparisons, are useful for display of differences between two different dose distributions but are often of limited value for the assessment of the discrepancies in terms of significance and/ or cause. In this paper, we present a new gradient compensation method for the evaluation of local dosimetric differences as a function of the dose gradient at each point in the dose distribution. To apply the method, the user specifies a distance parameter (typically 1 mm), which is the <b>geometric</b> <b>tolerance</b> the user is prepared to accept for the dose comparison. The expected geometric uncertainties in the comparison process can include finite calculation and measurement grids, small misalignments of measured and calculated results, and volume-averaging effects in the measurement detector. Since these uncertainties can obscure the interpretation of any of the analysis tools described above, removing dose differences related to the tolerable geometric uncertainty helps the gradient compensation method highlight algorithm and delivery-related differences. The remaining dose differences not explained by the <b>geometric</b> <b>tolerance</b> can then be evaluated graphically (dose difference display) or analytically (dose difference dose-volume histograms) over the entire comparison region.

40|$|Abstract: Every {{mechanical}} part is fabricated with {{variations in}} size and shape in the real world. Thus, tolerances are assigned to specify the tolerance zone corresponding to the allowable range of variation in the design shape within which the entire shape element must lie after the manufacturing process. <b>Geometric</b> <b>tolerances</b> constrain the size and the thickness of an individual shape element or its relative position and orientation {{with respect to the}} related datums. The eVect of the tolerances given to the datums should be propagated to the orientation and the location tolerances in the proper order of precedence.

40|$|A new {{mathematical}} model is introduced for the tolerances of cylindrical surfaces. The model {{is compatible with}} the ISO/ANSI/ASME Standard for <b>geometric</b> <b>tolerances.</b> Central to the new model is a Tolerance-Map ® 1, a hypothetical volume of points which corresponds to all possible locations and variations of a segment of a line (the axis) which can arise from tolerances on size, location, and orientation of the cylindrical surface. Each axis in a tolerance-zone will be represented with the six Plücker coordinates. Cylindrical surfaces in a tolerance-zone for the same hole can then be treated by attaching a size tolerance to each of the lines, thereby forming a screw. Relationships for the content of line-solids for a tolerance-zone are developed to correspond to the variations of locations. These are then used to get a measure for the increment in cost when a more refined tolerance is specified.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a problem solving {{approach}} to the dimensional and <b>geometric</b> <b>tolerances.</b> This approach starts from simple geometrical remarks concerning the functional/ assembly characteristics of a part. It assigns the <b>geometric</b> <b>tolerances</b> to the features by a method that connects the degrees of freedom to the measurements. For instance, the contact of a face on a plane, which cancels three degrees of freedom, allows the measurement of the forbidden translation (distance of a point, an axis, or a plane from the contact plane of the face) and the measurements of the forbidden rotations (angles between an axis or a plane and the contact plane of the face). Points, axes and planes are associated with features: a point to a spherical feature, an axis to a hole/shaft feature, a plane to a slot/tab feature or to a face. We have chosen the envelope mode to avoid the introduction of the spines related to the determination of central lines and median surfaces...|$|R
