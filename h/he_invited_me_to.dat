2500|$|This novel caused Adams {{to become}} acquainted with the {{well-known}} scientist Richard Dawkins. As Dawkins explains, [...] "As soon as I finished it, I turned back to page one and read it straight through again – the only time I have ever done that, and I wrote to tell him so. He replied {{that he was a}} fan of my books, and <b>he</b> <b>invited</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> his house in London." [...] Adams would later introduce Dawkins to the woman who was to become his third wife, the actress Lalla Ward, best known for playing the character Romana in Doctor Who. One of her early serials on the programme was City of Death, which Adams wrote, and which shares certain plot elements with the novel.|$|E
2500|$|However, it {{does not}} appear that Crowley waited for Reuss's {{response}} to assume his duties. In a diary entry for November 27, 1921, Crowley wrote: [...] "I have proclaimed myself O.H.O. Frater Superior of the Order of Oriental Templars." [...] Reuss died on October 28, 1923. In a letter to Heinrich Tränker dated February 14, 1925, Crowley stated the following: [...] "Reuss was very uncertain in temper, and in many ways unreliable. In his last years he seems to have completely lost his grip, even accusing The Book of the Law of communistic tendencies, than which no statement could be more absurd. Yet it seems that he must have been to some extent correctly led, on account of his having made the appointments of yourself and Frater Achad (Charles Stansfeld Jones), and designating me in his last letter as his successor." [...] In a letter to Charles Stansfeld Jones dated Sun in Capricorn, Anno XX (Dec. 1924 - Jan. 1925), Crowley said, [...] "in the O.H.O.'s last letter to me <b>he</b> <b>invited</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> become his successor as O.H.O. and Frater Superior." [...] Reuss's letter designating Crowley his successor as O.H.O. has not been found, but no credible documentation has surfaced which would indicate that Reuss ever designated any alternative successor.|$|E
2500|$|Solo {{performers}} praised {{his work}} with them. Artur Schnabel called Muck: [...] "a very great master, whose reliability, maturity and selfless dedication are not equaled by any living artist." [...] Paderewski called him [...] "an ideal accompanist". In physical terms, his conducting style required minimal movement, only small gestures {{with the tip of}} his baton. In areas of interpretation {{he was one of the}} first modernists. Though old enough to be part of generation known for taking liberties with the score and indulging in flexible tempos, he was by contrast disciplined and direct, less concerned with placing his personal stamp on a score than on demonstrating fidelity to the score and ceding a certain interpretive anonymity. By contrast with his conducting style, orchestra players found him impatient, explosive, nervous, and impulsive. He showed no casual or relaxed side of himself at concerts, rather [...] "he dominated the orchestra and the audience and the occasion." [...] The Austrian conductor Karl Böhm said in a 1972 interview: [...] "Karl Muck by chance heard me direct Lohengrin, and <b>he</b> <b>invited</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> study all Wagner's scores with him. He was the first and greatest influence on me... Muck told me where the orchestra should be more prominent, how to handle the Bayreuth acoustics, and so on." ...|$|E

2500|$|June Juanico [...] "recalls a {{time when}} she stood up to Elvis in front of his band of hangers-on, who even then were {{beginning}} to accompany him everywhere. He grabbed her arm, took her into the bathroom and declared: 'Look, you are so right, I am really sorry.' He kept her there for five minutes, then swaggered out, his image intact." [...] Julie Parrish, Presley's co-star in Paradise Hawaiian Style, relates, [...] "One time on set I had a real pain in my side – a side-effect, I think – and Elvis scooped me up, carried me into his trailer and shut the door. Outside the crew was waiting and wondering, but Elvis was oblivious to the innuendo. He placed his hand over my side and tried to do some healing on me." [...] Playboy star and actress June Wilkinson remembered that she [...] "met Elvis on the set of King Creole. <b>He</b> <b>invited</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> dinner at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel. ... Then Elvis gave me a tour of his suite, sat me on the bed in his bedroom and sang to me for two hours. That was it. The next day ... we had dinner again. He was very sweet, and he was friendly. He had more than sex on his mind. He got me to the airport on time, and our paths never crossed again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Yeston and David Hahn's In the Beginning, {{a musical}} poking good-natured {{fun at the}} first five books of the Bible from the {{perspective}} of ordinary people living through the events described, had been workshopped at the Manhattan Theatre Club with an initial Book by Larry Gelbart under the title [...] 1-2-3-4-5 in 1987 and 1988. [...] After various revisions and tryouts, it was finally produced under its current title at Maine State Music Theatre in 1998. A producer introduced Yeston to Alan Jay Lerner to show him a song from the show, [...] "New Words", and [...] "Lerner thought the song was so wonderful <b>he</b> <b>invited</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> stop by his office every couple of weeks so he could give me pointers. He said Oscar Hammerstein had done that for him and he wanted to do that for me. So, I really got coaching lessons – mentoring – in a series of meetings with Alan Jay Lerner as a result of having written that song." [...] In 1988 Yeston recorded a studio recording of a musical entitled , produced by the noted Phil Ramone. Plácido Domingo sang the role of Spanish painter Francisco de Goya, with Jennifer Rush, Gloria Estefan, Dionne Warwick, Richie Havens, and Seiko Matsuda. [...] Domingo was interested in starring in a stage musical about Goya and suggested to producer Alan Carr that Yeston would be the right person to create the vehicle, since Domingo had admired Yeston's work on Nine. [...] Because of Domingo's time commitments, the musical was made into a concept album instead.|$|E

50|$|Starting {{at the age}} of 13, {{while still}} in {{secondary}} school, Kellyjackie started putting her own covers of other Hong Kong pop singers' songs online. After about one year, she started writing her own songs. She then put her first self-composed song Lucky voice and her other songs onto the internet. In January 2005, when she was 16, she wrote the song <b>He</b> <b>invites</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> Disneyland (他約我去迪士尼) to cope with the stress of the Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination. She claimed the song was inspired by the classic fairy tale of Sleeping Beauty and court romance. She eventually repeated form five, and entered PLK Vicwood KT Chong Sixth Form College with satisfactory results, but left the College in a year to develop her singing career.|$|R

Hong Kong's Top Searches (搜尋人氣榜). Many DJs also started talking about the song on the radio. Many were amazed by her talent, given her age and her busy schedule as a secondary school student preparing for her O-level exams. Nevertheless, the song eventually became extremely popular and received widely positive reviews in Hong Kong, Macau, and Guangdong and landed her a 5-year recording contract.|$|R
