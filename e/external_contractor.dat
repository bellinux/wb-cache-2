50|$|The shed, {{initially}} called Whitehall, Erith {{was completed}} on 27 October 1899, under the South Eastern & Chatham Railway (SE&CR). Better equipped than major depots at Stewarts Lane or Ashford, {{the main building}} was fed by two 50 ft turntables, with a 150000 imp gal water tank feeding out via a dedicated water softener. The repair shed was equipped with two 5-tonne travelling cranes, allowing full reconstruction of all allocated engines. By the time the first locomotives arrived in November 1899, an <b>external</b> <b>contractor</b> had constructed the 158 houses of the new railway village. The {{total cost of the}} project was £74,500, and in scale it was only second to Stewarts Lane, able to service 100 steam locomotives.

During that period imprimatur sheets of stamps were kept by the Inland Revenue and the Post Office, and earlier examples from 1840-1914 was passed to the G.P.O.

30|$|Thus, {{while the}} {{standard}} input–output model is {{primarily concerned with}} commodity production and its transaction flow, the model in this paper departs from the latter in that the production of production technology is taken into account. That is, the production technology in each commodity sector must be produced at each time by the corresponding intermediate supplier that purchases relevant technology components from other intermediate suppliers. This assumption {{reflects the fact that}} manufacturing plants must continuously procure engineering services and technical support from internal engineering departments or <b>external</b> <b>contractors</b> for their operation. This can be understood as the purchasing of relevant technology components from intermediate sectors.|$|R
40|$|Abstract This study {{examines}} {{the case where}} market demand exceeds the companys capacity to manufacture. Manufacturing companies often function in situations where internal production resources constrain their throughput. Such situations are characterized as the problem of finite capacity scheduling. Management policy is to meet all demand {{in order to prevent}} competitor from entering the field. Now if management needs to decide what quantities of each product to manufacture and what quantities to buy from <b>external</b> <b>contractors.</b> In this study we have described two methodologies based on LP analysis to solve production outsourcing problem using latest version of MATLAB.

Our model leads to a rich set of predictions on the internal structure of multinational firms.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{practical}} and methodological challenges inherent in online behaviour change studies are both novel and complex. We relate our experiences of estimating and managing information technology (IT) research and intervention costs {{in an ongoing}} internet trial {{in the hope that}} others will find this information useful. Findings Actual IT costs were approximately twice those that had been originally estimated by <b>external</b> <b>contractors.</b> These original estimates for IT costs allowed little scope for the identification of new needs, which was intrinsic to the iterative nature of the research enterprise. Conclusions Making greater provision for the uncertain nature of these costs in future studies is a key practical lesson for the planning of future online behaviour change studies. </p...|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} theory of a firm in an {{environment}} with incomplete contracts. The firm’s headquarter decides on the complexity, the organization, and the global scale of its production process.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to study learning effects on maintenance outsourcing. We consider a situation in which a manufacturer offers a short-term outsourcing contract to an <b>external</b> <b>contractor</b> who is responsible for scheduling and performing preventive maintenance and carrying out minimal repairs when the process fails. The manufacturer's payment to the contractor consists of a fixed amount along with cost subsidization for each maintenance operation performed. We assume learning occurs when the contractor performs preventive maintenance that reduces both time and cost. Two types of learning are considered: natural learning and learning by costly efforts. We demonstrate that a well-designed payment scheme can induce the contractor to adopt the maintenance schedule that maximizes the manufacturer's profit. Maintenance outsourcing Learning Cost subsidization...|$|E
