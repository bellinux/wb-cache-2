50|$|The Pentax LX {{model was}} a tough, professional-grade {{competitor}} to the Nikon F3, the Canon F-1, Olympus OM cameras, and Contax RTS. It is rugged, weatherised and sealed against dust, yet compact and light. It has <b>interchangeable</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>screen</b> and viewfinder; the S69 screen is particularly bright. The LX uses an advanced metering system that also reads the light {{falling on the}} film and the first shutter curtain during exposure, the TTL OTF (off the film) feature, a Minolta patent, but utilised by Olympus in the OM-2 in 1975. The selected aperture value and shutter speed are shown in the viewfinder. The camera remained in production for more than 20 years.|$|E

5000|$|Interchangeable viewfinders, {{including}} <b>interchangeable</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>screens</b> in {{the case}} of SLRs. Viewfinders and <b>focusing</b> <b>screens</b> could give different metering options.|$|R
50|$|Continuing Nikon's {{practice}} at time, the F-501 has <b>interchangeable</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>screens,</b> {{a feature that}} is now quite unusual. Three screens (types B, E and J) were available for the F-501.|$|R
50|$|And the {{photographer}} had the choice among nine (later eleven) <b>interchangeable</b> <b>focussing</b> <b>screens.</b> It further had a socket for a synchronised flash shoe, mirror lock up feature, stop down lever, multi-exposure capability.|$|R
50|$|Other {{additions}} on the Canon 40D include <b>interchangeable</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>screens,</b> an AF-ON button, the EOS Integrated Cleaning System for sensor dust reduction, rubber strips {{around the}} battery and CF doors for improved weather sealing and three new optional accessories: an IS {{version of the}} 18-55mm kit lens; a new backward-compatible, live view mode, and a weather-sealed battery grip.|$|R
5000|$|... 1950: Ihagee Exakta Varex (East Germany; called Exakta V in USA): first {{interchangeable}} viewfinder, first <b>interchangeable</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>screens,</b> first viewfinder {{condenser lens}} SLR. Original viewfinder selection was waist-level or pentaprism. For the next half-century, interchangeable viewfinder customization was the signal feature of fully professional level SLRs, {{although they have}} not made the transition to digital SLRs.|$|R
50|$|Every lens {{has its own}} Seikosha (chrome) or Seiko (black) leaf shutter {{system with}} a shutter speed of B, 1' -1/500 sec, X or M flash {{synchronisation}} and bulb mode.The C330 camera has two shutter release buttons, an automatic conversion film counter 120/220, {{an indicator of the}} film in use, a removable back cover, a hexagonal distance scale rod for the different lenses, automatic parallax compensation, an automatic exposure factor indicator and <b>interchangeable</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>screens.</b>|$|R
50|$|Except {{for having}} an {{enormous}} variety of lenses {{with the popular}} K mount to choose from, the K1000 has fewer features compared to higher-level SLRs of the mid 1970s. The camera has a flash synchronization speed of 1/60th second, a sleeve-bushing equipped shutter and film advance mechanism, no self timer, no depth-of-field preview, no mirror lockup, no <b>interchangeable</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>screens,</b> no motor drive option, and no autoexposure. The K1000 is a completely manual camera.|$|R
5000|$|... 1950: The first SLR with <b>interchangeable</b> viewfinders and <b>focusing</b> <b>screens,</b> the Exakta Varex.|$|R
5000|$|The FM2 is a mechanically-controlled manual focus SLR with manual {{exposure}} control. It is operable without batteries and only needs the two S76 or A76 batteries, or one 1/3N battery {{to power the}} light meter, which consisted of an internal 60/40 percent centerweighted system linked to a center-the-LED exposure control system. The exposure control system used vertically arranged +/o/- light emitting diodes (LEDs) {{on the right side}} of the viewfinder to indicate the readings of the meter versus actual camera settings. This metering system can be traced back to the [...] Nikkormat FT (aka Nikomat FT) of 1965 and its center-the-needle system. The viewfinder also had Nikonâ€™s standard <b>interchangeable</b> <b>focus</b> <b>screen</b> with various <b>focusing</b> options.|$|R
50|$|The FTb was {{primarily}} {{intended to be}} a camera for the advanced amateur photographer, offering many of the same features and same build quality as the F-1, but without the option of <b>interchangeable</b> prisms, <b>focusing</b> <b>screens,</b> or motor drives. The Canon FTb was released at a retail price of 35,000 yen for the camera body ($99, or $580 USD in 2014 USD).|$|R
50|$|The New F-1 is an {{expandable}} system. It {{consists of}} <b>interchangeable</b> viewfinders, <b>focusing</b> <b>screens,</b> motor drives, and alternate backs, {{all of which}} are specific to the New F-1. All other Canon components, such as the FD lens series, close up accessories (bellows, extension tubes, etc.), and Canon A and T Speedlights (except the 300TL) are also compatible with the system.|$|R
5000|$|The FE has a [...] "full information" [...] {{viewfinder}} {{very similar}} to the Nikkormat EL. In addition to the metering shutter scale, the viewfinder also displays the set lens aperture through an optical [...] "eye" [...] (this particular feature missing on the Nikkormat EL) and has a flash [...] "ready" [...] LED to give context to the metering needles. The viewfinder also introduced <b>interchangeable</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>screens</b> to the compact F-series: the standard Nikon Type K screen (3 mm split image rangefinder and 1 mm microprism collar focusing aids plus 12 mm etched circle indicating the area of the meter centerweighting) could be replaced by Type B (central 3 mm focusing spot plus 12 mm etched circle) and Type E (Type B plus a grid of five horizontal and three vertical lines; called the [...] "architectural screen") screens.|$|R
5000|$|Also {{like the}} A-1, the AE-1 Program {{supports}} <b>interchangeable</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>screens.</b> Unlike the A-1, though, which specifies that screens {{should only be}} changed by the factory or by experienced service technicians, those on the AE-1 Program can be changed by the user. The camera came standard with the new split/microprism screen, but seven others were available. Unfortunately, the AE-1 Program retains the older A-series type electromagnet-controlled cloth-curtain shutter that limits top shutter speed to 1/1000 of a second, together with a rather slow flash sync speed of 1/60 second. In {{the years since the}} AE-1 Program was introduced, this shutter design has also proven to be more maintenance-intensive than modern vertical-travel metal blade designs. The camera's electronics and electromagnets are powered by one 4SR44, PX28A, A544, K28A, V34PX, 4LR44, or L544 alkaline batteries.The <b>focusing</b> <b>screen</b> on the AE-1 Program is brighter than any previous <b>focusing</b> <b>screen</b> on any Canon manual focus camera, allowing the user to focus with greater ease with [...] "slow" [...] lenses (up to f/5.6). It is the same <b>focusing</b> <b>screen</b> design that is used in the newest model of the top-of-the-line Canon F-1 (known as the New F-1).|$|R
50|$|The F2 {{also had}} <b>interchangeable</b> {{viewfinder}} <b>focusing</b> <b>screens.</b> Nippon Kogaku's standard Type K screen had central 3 mm split image rangefinder and 1 mm microprism collar focusing aids on a matte/Fresnel background plus a 12 mm etched circle indicating {{the area of}} the meter centerweighting. There were 18 other screens available with a variety of focusing aids or etched guidelines choices, including none at all. Note that the screens for the F2 were interchangeable with the ones for the Nikon F, but not with later F-series SLRs.|$|R
5000|$|The X-700 {{used the}} basic {{body of the}} XG-M with {{electronically}} controlled stepless speeds, but added full program autoexposure {{in addition to the}} XG-M's aperture priority and metered manual modes. This program mode was referred to as [...] "MPS" [...] or Minolta Program System. It also introduced through-the-lens (TTL) flash metering, and added exposure lock and <b>interchangeable</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>screens</b> to the XG-M's features, the X-700 was aimed to appeal to the widest range of photographers as it could, it's easy to use fully automated Program mode could turn it into a point-and-shoot that anybody could use, but it's wide array of advanced features and available accessories and lenses made it appealing to professionals alike. Based on the X-700 chassis, Minolta later launched various other models based on the X-700 : X-300,300S,300N,370,500,570 and 600. The X-500 lacked the X-700's program exposure mode, but featured a fill-in flash mode. The X-300 was the basic model of the late X-series. It lacked TTL flash metering and program exposure mode, it did not show the f-stop-setting of the lens in the viewfinder and it did not have a depth-of-field control button. Basic parts of all three cameras, such as the shutter, viewfinder, mirror system, and light metering system, were identical.|$|R
50|$|In manual mode, {{the camera}} is {{completely}} mechanical in operation, and only requires batteries for the light metering information system. In aperture priority mode, the batteries continued to power the meter, but are also utilized for shutter timing and the exposure control electronics. The FM3A's metering information system consisted of a match-needle system using two needles pointing along a vertical shutter speed scale {{on the left side}} of the viewfinder to indicate the readings of the built-in 60/40% centerweighted silicon photodiode light meter versus the actual camera settings. This system can be traced back to the Nikkormat EL (Nikomat EL in Japan) of 1972. The viewfinder also has Nikon's fully <b>interchangeable</b> bright <b>focus</b> <b>screen</b> with various options for focus.|$|R
50|$|While the T90 {{does not}} support the vast range of {{accessories}} available for Canon's F-1, F-1n or New F-1, a number of significant accessories are available. The pentaprism is not <b>interchangeable,</b> but the <b>focusing</b> <b>screen</b> is; eight different screens are available for different applications. Standard is the New Split/Microprism screen, which offers three of the most common focusing aids simultaneously; the central circle is a split image prism, surrounded by a microprism ring; the rest of the screen is a laser matte.|$|R
50|$|The FE2 is a {{battery-powered}} (two S76 or A76, or one 1/3N) electro-mechanically controlled manual-focus SLR with {{manual exposure}} control or aperture-priority auto-exposure.It has a match-needle exposure control system using two needles pointing along a vertical {{shutter speed scale}} {{on the left side}} of the viewfinder to indicate the readings of the built-in 60/40 percent center-weighted light meter versus the actual camera settings.This system can be traced back to the Nikkormat EL (in the USA/Canada; Nikomat EL, rest of the world) of 1972 and continued until 2006 with the Nikon FM3A.The viewfinder also has an <b>interchangeable</b> Type K2 <b>focusing</b> <b>screen</b> with Nikon's standard 3 mm split image rangefinder and 1 mm micro-prism collar focusing aids plus 12 mm etched circle indicating the area of the meter center-weighting.|$|R
50|$|Leitz also {{addressed}} {{complaints about the}} original Leicaflex <b>focusing</b> <b>screen</b> in the SL <b>focusing</b> <b>screen,</b> which offered a ground-glass <b>focusing</b> <b>screen</b> with a central microprism spot. This more conventional configuration did not prevent it from being very bright and comfortable.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>focusing</b> <b>screen</b> is a flat {{translucent}} material, {{either a}} ground glass or fresnel lens, {{found in a}} system camera that allows the user of the camera to preview the framed image in a viewfinder. Often, <b>focusing</b> <b>screens</b> are available in variants with different etched markings for various purposes. For instance, [...] "overall matte" [...] <b>focusing</b> <b>screens</b> with no etchings are a popular choice for astrophotography and other low-light situations.|$|R
50|$|Although {{promoted}} as a feature, center-weighted metering was originally {{a consequence of}} the meter cell reading from the <b>focusing</b> <b>screen</b> of SLR cameras. Light scatter from the <b>focusing</b> <b>screen</b> and proximity of the meter cell caused fall off at the edges.|$|R
50|$|A basic DOF adapter {{usually has}} four {{components:}} a macro lens, an optional plano-convex lens, a translucent <b>focusing</b> <b>screen,</b> {{and finally a}} photographic lens of the user's choice. On camcorders without sufficient macro capability, a macro lens, preferably an achromatic doublet (to minimize chromatic aberration), is usually attached directly to the camcorder so that the camcorder can zoom in {{and focus on the}} <b>focusing</b> <b>screen.</b> Without the macro lens, certain camcorders would be unable to zoom in well enough to frame the entire <b>focusing</b> <b>screen</b> and still achieve sharp focus. The optional plano-convex lens is used to avoid vignetting in the image. The <b>focusing</b> <b>screen</b> is where the photographic lens image is projected. The screen must be placed at precisely the correct distance from the flange focal mount of whatever lens is being used (most popularly the Canon FD or Nikon F mount), referred to as the flange back distance. Finally, the front lens is a photographic or cinema lens that projects the image desired onto the <b>focusing</b> <b>screen.</b>|$|R
