Genes which caused cross resistance or cross sensitivity between cisplatin and paclitaxel were also examined, the majority of these genes were apoptosis associated genes which may be useful for predicting cross resistance.

We have engineered MSCs {{to express the}} pro-apoptotic protein tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) and are currently preparing this <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>cell</b> therapy for a phase 1 / 2 a clinical trial in patients with metastatic lung cancer. To do this, we need to prepare a cryopreserved allogeneic MSCTRAIL cell bank for further expansion before patient delivery. The effects of cryopreservation on a <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>cell</b> therapy product have not been clearly determined. MethodsWe tested different concentrations of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) added to the human serum albumin ZENALB 4. 5 and measured post-thaw cell viability, proliferation ability and differentiation characteristics. In addition, we examined the homing ability, TRAIL expression and cancer cell–killing capacities of cryopreserved genetically modified MSCs compared with fresh, continually cultured cells. ResultsWe demonstrated that the post-thaw viability of MSCs in 5 % DMSO (v/v) with 95 % ZENALB 4. 5 (v/v) is 85. 7 [*]±[*] 0. 4 %, which is comparable to that in conventional freezing media. We show that cryopreservation {{does not affect the}} long-term expression of TRAIL and that cryopreserved TRAIL-expressing MSCs exhibit similar levels of homing and, importantly, retain their potency in triggering cancer cell death. ConclusionsThis study shows that cryopreservation is unlikely to affect the therapeutic properties of MSCTRAIL and supports the generation of a cryopreserved master cell bank...|$|E

30|$|These {{include several}} types of in vitro assays (e.g. {{reporter}} gene assays using yeast and vertebrate cell lines), but also in vivo laboratory tests, as e.g. the Early Life Stage-test with the zebrafish Danio rerio or the growth inhibition tests with Lumbriculus variegatus or Lemna minor. The reporter gene bioassays are based on <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>cell</b> lines, which have been stably transfected with specific reporter genes (e.g. firefly luciferase). Reporter genes are induced and translated {{in the presence of}} specifically acting compounds (e.g. estrogens, androgens etc.), and the enzymatic activity of the reporter protein is easily determined (e.g. measuring bioluminescence). The detection of antagonistic activity requires a background concentration of the agonistic reference substance and, hence, antagonistic activity in the sample leads to a reduced expression and activity of the reporter enzyme (i.e. decrease in luminescence or color change). This battery of bioassays therefore provides a comprehensive overview of the overall toxicity of the test samples (e.g. surface water, effluent or sediment).|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To compare {{different}} {{techniques of}} transfection of primary human corneal endothelial cells (HCECs) by nonviral methods and to enrich <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>cells</b> {{to a highly}} pure population. Methods: HCECs were cultured following previously published methods. Dissection of the Descemet membrane (DM) was performed by tearing off strips from corneal buttons with forceps or by hydrodissection. Confirmation of HCECs identity was performed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) for α 2 collagen VIII. For transfection, non-viral methods such as lipid-/liposome-mediated reagents and electroporation techniques were compared. <b>Genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>cells</b> were enriched by use of selection antibiotics and flow cytometry. Results: Viability of primary HCECs was lower in hydrodissected corneas. The rate of transfection varied from approximately 5 %– 30 %. Highest rates of transfection were obtained with the Amaxa electroporation method. The next highest rate was yielded by the lipid-mediated reagent GenCarrier 2, followed by electroporation with the BTX apparatus. Toxicity was moderate and manageable by adjusting the concentration of reagents, incubation times, and electrical parameters.

40|$|Receptor dimerization {{is the key}} {{signaling}} {{event for}} many cytokines, including erythropoietin. A system has been recently developed that permits intracellular protein dimerization to be reversibly activated {{in response to a}} lipid-soluble dimeric form of the drug FK 506, called FK 1012. FK 1012 is used as a pharmacological mediator of dimerization to bring together FK 506 binding domains, taken from the endogenous protein FKBP 12. In experiments reported herein, FK 1012 -induced dimerization of a fusion protein containing the intracellular portion of the erythropoietin receptor allowed cells normally dependent on interleukin 3 to proliferate in its absence. FK 506 competitively reversed the proliferative effect of FK 1012 but had no influence on the proliferative effect of interleukin 3. Signaling pathways activated by FK 1012 mimicked those activated by erythropoietin, because both JAK 2 and STAT 5 were phosphorylated in response to FK 1012.

40|$|Cytoxicity {{induced by}} the {{herpesvirus}} thymidine kinase (TK) gene in combination with prodrugs is dependent on cell growth and leads to the elimination of <b>genetically</b> <b>modified</b> <b>cells,</b> thus limiting the duration of expression and efficacy of this treatment in vivo.

Expression of p 27 by transfection substantially reduced cell cycle progression, and its activity was enhanced by mutations designed to stabilize the protein. Coexpression of p 27 and TK or a p 27 /TK fusion protein led to greater prodrug cytotoxicity than that produced by TK alone in the Renca cell line, which is sensitive to bystander killing.
