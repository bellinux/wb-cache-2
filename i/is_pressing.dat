5|$|Rita {{finds out}} from a county sheriff that Paul, her abusive ex-husband who {{attacked}} her the night before, <b>is</b> <b>pressing</b> charges against her for assault. She talks with a lawyer, who tells her that since she invited Paul into her house, she cannot prove that her intent was to defuse the situation. At a hearing, it is revealed that Rita violated her and Paul's custody agreement, making Paul's case against her even stronger. When Paul drops by Rita's house to return their children, he threatens Dexter when the two are alone in the kitchen, and Dexter responds by hitting him with a frying pan. Paul loses consciousness, so Dexter drives his body back to Paul's hotel and frames him for drug abuse. Dexter alerts the police and Paul is sent back to prison.|$|E
5|$|In a bid {{to impress}} Martin and his colleagues, Rhys {{purchases}} a barbecue and invites them over for dinner. He is granted {{an interview with the}} surgical board to join their training program at the hospital. Following a night out with Dane Canning (Luke Pegler), Rhys gets a hangover and is horrified to learn his interview has been moved to an earlier time. Rhys struggles to answer the panel's questions and he is not invited to join the program. He later visits his mother, Elaine, at her hospice, where he tells her he has joined the program. Rhys treats Chris Pappas (James Mason) after he is attacked, but fails to get him to stay for his X-rays. Aidan Foster (Bobby Morley) spots that Chris has a broken rib, which <b>is</b> <b>pressing</b> on his lung and Rhys finds him collapsed on the floor of Fitzgerald Motors. Rhys performs an emergency decompression on his lung and saves his life. Rhys asks senior surgeon Jessica Girdwood (Glenda Linscott) to reconsider letting him join the surgical program, but she declines. Rhys tries unsuccessfully to get Robbie O'Brien to quit the program and he turns his attentions to Erin Salisbury. He pretends to be romantically interested in her and tries to distract her from her studies.|$|E

The subject reported he saw red spots passing before his eyes and red-purple spots on the floor, and the floor seemed very close to his face.

She expects to lose her job and leaves the asylum. Arden learns that Sister Mary Eunice had removed the disfigured Shelley from his lab while his wound was being treated at the hospital. He believes that she has placed Shelley outside with the Raspers, when Shelley is actually found in the stairwell near a school playground.|$|E
25|$|The surgery {{most often}} used in such cases is called {{transurethral}} resection of the prostate (TURP or TUR). In TURP, an instrument is inserted through the urethra to remove prostate tissue that <b>is</b> <b>pressing</b> against {{the upper part of}} the urethra and restricting the flow of urine. TURP results in the removal of mostly transitional zone tissue in a patient with BPH. Older men often have corpora amylacea (amyloid), dense accumulations of calcified proteinaceous material, in the ducts of their prostates. The corpora amylacea may obstruct the lumens of the prostatic ducts, and may underlie some cases of BPH.|$|E

The QZSS mission is the last scheduled major independent mission for JAXA, as no major civilian projects were funded after that for now. The only exception is the IGS programme which will be continued beyond 2008. However it seems Japan <b>is</b> <b>pressing</b> forward now with the GCOM earth observation satellites as successors to the ADEOS missions. First launch is planned for 2010.|$|E
500|$|Surgery may be necessary, e.g. {{to relieve}} excess {{pressure}} on the cord, to stabilize the spine, or to put vertebrae back in their proper place. [...] In cases involving instability or compression, failing to operate can lead to worsening of the condition. Surgery is also necessary when something <b>is</b> <b>pressing</b> on the cord, such as bone fragments, blood, material from ligaments or intervertebral discs, or a lodged object from a penetrating injury. Although the ideal timing of surgery is still debated, {{studies have found that}} earlier surgical intervention (within 24 hours of injury) is associated with better outcomes. [...] Sometimes a patient has too many other injuries to be a surgical candidate this early. Surgery is controversial because it has potential complications (such as infection), so in cases where it is not clearly needed (e.g. the cord is being compressed), doctors must decide whether to perform surgery based on aspects of the patient's condition and their own beliefs about its risks and benefits.|$|E

2500|$|It {{was also}} {{reported}} that top Pakistani Foreign Office officials alleged Pakistan's President, Asif Ali Zardari instructed the Foreign Office in categorical terms that Davis be given diplomatic immunity and for this purpose the Foreign Office should immediately issue a backdated letter notifying Davis as 'member of staff member of the US embassy, in Islamabad.' Former foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi refused, saying: [...] "on {{the basis of the}} official record and the advice given to me by the technocrats and experts of the Foreign Office, I could not certify him (Raymond Davis) as a diplomat. The kind of by blanket immunity Washington <b>is</b> <b>pressing</b> for Davis, is not endorsed by the official record of the Foreign Ministry." [...] Qureshi reiterated this stance after a meeting with Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry on February 16. Qureshi said he kept quiet on the Davis case earlier upon instructions from the leadership of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP), but implied that his stance on the matter had cost him his job. As of February 16 a new foreign minister has not yet been appointed.|$|E

2500|$|... (6) Time {{trouble is}} another {{consideration}} noted by various authors, including Webb himself. This has two aspects; the more obvious is exploiting the opponent's time pressure to perpetrate a swindle. Ali Mortazavi observes that [...] "when {{the clock is}} ticking and time <b>is</b> <b>pressing,</b> a player's intuition is most likely to let him down, and this is where the swindler will get his opportunity." [...] He writes, [...] "It is of the utmost importance that the swindler conducts himself in the appropriate fashion when his opponent is in time trouble." [...] This includes calmly reflecting rather than rushing one's moves. GM Pal Benko notes that it is unpleasant for the player in time trouble to have to wait at the board, without daring even to get up to get a drink of water; this also makes the player in time trouble impatient, interferes with his concentration, and may cause him to mix up his planned responses. Mortazavi also advocates that, in general, one should avoid playing the most obvious moves (one-move traps, obvious pawn breaks, checks, etc.), since the player in time trouble will likely have analyzed and have responses ready for them.|$|E
