40|$|Pedestrian <b>head</b> <b>form</b> impactors are <b>test</b> devices {{simulating}} {{the human}} head, used for evaluating pedestrian protection afforded by a passenger car front during a pedestrian-to-car-collision. A 3. 5 kg <b>head</b> <b>form</b> impactor was developed representing {{the head of}} a range of humans between a 6 year old child and a small female. The technical specifications of the 3. 5 kg <b>head</b> <b>form</b> impactor and the evaluation of the prototype response under two different test conditions are presented in this paper. Als presented is the development of a mathematical model of this tool and its validation...|$|R
40|$|American {{football}} is notorious {{for being a}} high impact sport. There exists an especially high amount of danger to each player's brain, created in part by gameplay, {{but also from the}} helmets worn by the athletes. Football helmet pads were comparatively investigated, in order to find a better alternative that can lower the amount of acceleration on the brain. A new pad system was introduced that allows for the force to be dissipated horizontally, through use of a dashpot-like center, also employing a foam shell to assist in the vertical energy dissipation. The pad currently used, along with the new dashpot system were further tested inside helmet shells on a <b>head</b> <b>form</b> drop <b>test,</b> and compared to the national standards that regulate athletic equipment. by Christine Elizabeth Labaza.

40|$|A {{combination}} of local flow measurement techniques and fog flow visualization {{was used to}} determine the inward leakage for two tight-fitting powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs), the 3 M Breathe-Easy PAPR and the SE 400 breathing demand PAPR. The PAPRs were mounted on a breathing machine <b>head</b> <b>form,</b> and flows were measured from the blower and into the breathing machine. Both respirators leaked a little at the beginning of inhalation, probably through their exhalation valves.

5000|$|A <b>head</b> normal <b>form</b> is {{not always}} a normal form, because the applied {{arguments}} [...] need not be normal. However, the converse is true: any normal form is also a <b>head</b> normal <b>form.</b> In fact, the normal forms are exactly the <b>head</b> normal <b>forms</b> in which the subterms [...] are themselves normal forms. This gives an inductive syntactic description of normal forms.|$|R
30|$|Each node in {{the network}} is {{connected}} in a single-hop communication to its corresponding cluster head in the above hierarchy level using link correlation, whereas in level-k hierarchy multi-hop communication is adopted between cluster heads. The level-k cluster <b>heads</b> <b>form</b> the bottleneck zone of the sink which has heavy traffic flow. This results in faster depletion of its energy reducing the network life time. To overcome it, the heterogeneous nodes are adopted as level-k cluster head, since it have more energy compared to normal nodes. After establishing a level-k cluster hierarchy using link correlation as described in section 3.1, the level-k cluster <b>head</b> <b>forms</b> a TDMA time slot for its corresponding a level-(k- 1) cluster head, while the level-(k- 1) cluster <b>head</b> <b>forms</b> a TDMA time slot for a level-(k- 2) cluster head and it is followed for all the sub-clusters. The TDMA time slot adopted between cluster heads in subsequent levels of hierarchy helps to remove the data collision and cutback the data aggregation (DA) time.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1978 An inbred cabbage line (Brassica oleracea L. (Capitata group)) and an inbred {{broccoli}} line (B. oleracea L. (Italica group)) were crossed. F₁ progeny were vigorous annuals. Of 3, 260 F₂ plants, 250 were biennials and 70 developed cabbage heads. Of these 70, 32 were annuals. Days {{to first}} visible buds of the annuals and internode length varied continuously {{and appeared to}} be controlled by a few genes with modifiers. Both are primarily controlled by additive gene action as shown graphically and by the heritability estimates calculated by Warner's method. Cabbage <b>head</b> <b>forming</b> ability, clasping of leaves and annual-biennial habit also appear to be controlled by a number of genes. Open leaves were dominant over clasped; annual habit was dominant over biennial; and cabbage <b>head</b> <b>forming</b> plants were a minority. Chi square tests showed a highly significant association between cabbage <b>head</b> <b>forming</b> ability and biennial habit. Clasping of leaves, a factor in cabbage heading, was also shown to be associated with biennial habit...|$|R
