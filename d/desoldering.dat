2500|$|In silversmithing or jewelry making, special hard solders {{are used}} that will pass assay. They contain a high {{proportion}} of the metal being soldered and lead is not used in these alloys. These solders vary in hardness, designated as [...] "enameling", [...] "hard", [...] "medium" [...] and [...] "easy". Enameling solder has a high melting point, close to that of the material itself, to prevent the joint <b>desoldering</b> during firing in the enameling process. The remaining solder types are used in decreasing order of hardness during the process of making an item, to prevent a previously soldered seam or joint <b>desoldering</b> while additional sites are soldered. Easy solder is also often used for repair work for the same reason. Flux or rouge is also used to prevent joints from <b>desoldering.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Desoldering</b> braid, {{also known}} as <b>desoldering</b> wick or solder wick, is finely braided 18 to 42 AWG copper wire coated with rosin flux, usually {{supplied}} on a roll.|$|E
50|$|Otherwise all joints must {{be freed}} from solder before the {{component}} can be removed. Each joint must be heated and the solder removed from it while molten using a vacuum pump, manual <b>desoldering</b> pump, or <b>desoldering</b> braid.|$|E
25|$|When boards {{fail the}} test, {{technicians}} may <b>desolder</b> and replace failed components, a task known as rework.|$|R
50|$|Enthusiasts {{and free}} {{developers}} {{have shown that}} it is possible to <b>desolder</b> the on-board SIM IC and connect a SIM socket/card to use this phone in other networks or countries. Because this is one of the most modern QWERTY-phones, there is a huge demand for this model in the Android developer community.|$|R
50|$|The {{boundary}} scan produces a complete forensic {{image of the}} volatile and non-volatile memory. The risk of data change is minimized and the memory chip doesn't have to be <b>desoldered.</b> Generating the image can be slow and not all mobile devices are JTAG enabled. Also, {{it can be difficult}} to find the test access port.|$|R
50|$|<b>Desoldering</b> {{the chips}} is done {{carefully}} and slowly, {{so that the}} heat does not destroy the chip or data. Before the chip is desoldered the PCB is baked in an oven to eliminate remaining water. This prevents the so-called popcorn effect, at which the remaining water would blow the chip package at <b>desoldering.</b>|$|E
50|$|It is good {{practice}} to remove solder from a joint prior to resoldering—desoldering braids or vacuum <b>desoldering</b> equipment (solder suckers) can be used. <b>Desoldering</b> wicks contain plenty of flux that will lift the contamination from the copper trace and any device leads that are present. This will leave a bright, shiny, clean junction to be resoldered.|$|E
50|$|A {{soldering}} station, invariably temperature-controlled, {{consists of}} an electrical power supply, control circuitry with provision for user adjustment of temperature and display, and a soldering iron or soldering head with a tip temperature sensor. The station will normally have a stand for the hot iron when not in use, and a wet sponge for cleaning. It is most commonly used for soldering electronic components. Other functions may be combined; for example a rework station, mainly for surface-mount components may have a hot air gun, vacuum pickup tool, and a soldering head; a <b>desoldering</b> station will have a <b>desoldering</b> head with vacuum pump for <b>desoldering</b> through-hole components, and a soldering iron head.|$|E
50|$|Ball grid arrays (BGA) {{and chip}} scale {{packages}} (CSA) present special difficulties for testing and rework, {{as they have}} many small, closely spaced pads on their underside which are connected to matching pads on the PCB. Connecting pins are not accessible from the top for testing, and cannot be <b>desoldered</b> without heating the whole device to the melting point of solder.|$|R
50|$|If the USB drive has no {{protection}} switch, a blocker {{can be used}} to mount the drive in a read-only mode or, in an exceptional case, the memory chip can be <b>desoldered.</b> The SIM and memory cards need a card reader to make the copy. The SIM card is soundly analyzed, such {{that it is possible to}} recover (deleted) data like contacts or text messages.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to replacing the old firmware, the upgrade requires a substantial {{modification of the}} JX hardware. Each of the two sound boards has to be equipped with an additional PCB {{that has to be}} connected with 36 wires soldered to the sound board. The original 8031 CPUs have to be <b>desoldered</b> and replaced by more modern 80C320 CPUs. Experienced solderers have reported to take several hours to finish the mod.|$|R
50|$|The {{advantage}} of forensic <b>desoldering</b> {{is that the}} device {{does not need to}} be functional and that a copy without any changes to the original data can be made. The disadvantage is that the re-balling devices are expensive, so this process is very costly and there are some risks of total data loss. Hence, forensic <b>desoldering</b> should only be done by experienced laboratories.|$|E
50|$|Hot {{plates are}} widely used in the {{electronics}} industry {{as a method of}} soldering and <b>desoldering</b> components onto circuit boards.|$|E
50|$|In electronics, <b>desoldering</b> is {{the removal}} of solder and {{components}} from a circuit board for troubleshooting, repair, replacement, and salvage.|$|E
25|$|Bismuth {{significantly}} {{lowers the}} melting point and improves wettability. In presence of sufficient lead and tin, bismuth forms crystals of Sn16Pb32Bi52 with melting point of only 95°C, which diffuses {{along the grain}} boundaries and may cause a joint failure at relatively low temperatures. A high-power part pre-tinned with an alloy of lead can therefore <b>desolder</b> under load when soldered with a bismuth-containing solder. Such joints are also prone to cracking. Alloys with more than 47% Bi expand upon cooling, which {{may be used to}} offset thermal expansion mismatch stresses. Retards growth of tin whiskers. Relatively expensive, limited availability.|$|R
50|$|Heat {{guns are}} used in physics, {{materials}} science, chemistry, engineering, and other laboratory and workshop settings. Different types of heat gun operating at different temperatures and with different airflow {{can be used to}} strip paint, shrink heat shrink tubing, shrink film, and shrink wrap packaging, dry out damp wood, bend and weld plastic, soften adhesives, and thaw frozen pipes. Heat guns, often called hot air guns or hot air stations for this application, {{are used in}} electronics to <b>desolder</b> and rework surface-mounted circuit board components.Heat guns are also used for functional testing of overheat protection devices, in order to safely simulate an overheat condition.|$|R
5000|$|In silversmithing or jewelry making, special hard solders {{are used}} that will pass assay. They contain a high {{proportion}} of the metal being soldered and lead is not used in these alloys.

50|$|<b>Desoldering</b> {{requires}} {{application of}} heat to the solder joint and removing the molten solder {{so that the}} joint may be separated. <b>Desoldering</b> {{may be required to}} replace a defective component, to alter an existing circuit, or to salvage components for re-use. Use of too high a temperature or heating for too long may damage components or destroy the bond between a printed circuit trace and the board substrate. Techniques are different for through-hole and surface-mounted components.|$|E
50|$|After <b>desoldering</b> {{the chip}} a re-balling process cleans the chip and adds new tin balls to the chip. Re-balling {{can be done}} in two {{different}} ways.|$|E
50|$|If they do {{not need}} to be re-used, some surface-mount {{components}} can be removed by cutting their leads and <b>desoldering</b> the remnants with a soldering iron.|$|E
5000|$|Hot, or soldering, {{tweezers}} {{combine the}} squeezing action of mechanical tweezers with heating, to grip small surface-mount electronic devices while simultaneously heating them, for soldering or <b>desoldering.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A <b>desoldering</b> pump, colloquially {{known as}} a solder sucker, is a {{manually-operated}} device {{which is used to}} remove solder from a printed circuit board. There are two types: the plunger style and bulb style. (An electrically-operated pump for this purpose would usually be called a vacuum pump.) ...|$|E
50|$|Anti-computer {{forensics}} is {{more difficult}} {{because of the small}} size of the devices and the user's restricted data accessibility. Nevertheless, there are developments to secure the memory in hardware with security circuits in the CPU and memory chip, such that the memory chip cannot be read even after <b>desoldering.</b>|$|E
50|$|The tip is {{reported}} to be very easily damaged mechanically. The unit does not have enough power for effective <b>desoldering</b> of many board- and chassis-mounted components. The design of the tip is incompatible with some soldering techniques such as dragging or continuous-flow soldering (a popular technique for hand-soldering high-pin-count SMT packages, based on the principles of wave soldering).|$|E
50|$|Hot air pumps blow air {{hot enough}} to melt all the solder around a small surface mounted part, {{and can be used}} for {{soldering}} parts in place, and for <b>desoldering</b> followed by removal before the solder solidifies by a vacuum pump or with tweezers. Hot air has a tendency to oxidise metals; a non-oxidising gas, usually nitrogen, can be used instead of air, at increased cost of equipment and consumables.|$|E
50|$|Heating {{a single}} SMD with a hot-air gun to melt all solder joints {{between it and}} the PCB is usually the first step, {{followed}} by removing the SMD while the solder is molten. The pad array on the conductor board should then be cleaned of old solder. It is quite easy to remove these residues by heating them to melting temperature. A soldering iron or hot air gun can be used with <b>desoldering</b> braid.|$|E
50|$|Obtaining the ROM data by oneself {{directly}} from the hardware being emulated can be extremely difficult, technical, and expensive, since it may require <b>desoldering</b> of integrated circuit chips from the circuit board of the device they own. The desoldered IC is placed into a chip reader device connected to a USB or serial port of another computer, with pin sockets on the reader specifically designed to match the chip package shape in question, to perform a memory dump of the ROM to a data file.|$|E
50|$|For {{soldering}} and <b>desoldering</b> small surface-mount components {{with two}} terminals, such as some links, resistors, capacitors, and diodes, soldering tweezers can be used; {{they can be}} either free-standing or controlled from a soldering station. The tweezers have two heated tips mounted on arms whose separation can be manually varied by squeezing gently against spring force, like simple tweezers; the tips are applied to the two ends of the component. The main purpose of the soldering tweezers is to melt solder in the correct place; components are usually moved by simple tweezers or vacuum pickup.|$|E
50|$|Rework (or re-work) is {{the term}} for the {{refinishing}} operation or repair of an electronic printed circuit board (PCB) assembly, usually involving <b>desoldering</b> and re-soldering of surface-mounted electronic components (SMD). Mass processing techniques are not applicable to single device repair or replacement, and specialized manual techniques by expert personnel using appropriate equipment are required to replace defective components; area array packages such as ball grid array (BGA) devices particularly require expertise and appropriate tools. A hot air gun or hot air station is used to heat devices and melt solder, and specialised tools are used {{to pick up and}} position often tiny components.|$|E
50|$|Suction {{pumps are}} used to suck away molten solder, leaving {{previously}} joined terminals disconnected. They are primarily used to release through-hole connections from a PCB. The <b>desoldering</b> head must be designed so that the extracted solder does not solidify so as to obstruct it, or enter the pump, and can be removed and discarded easily. It {{is not possible to}} remove a multi-pin part by melting solder on the pins sequentially, as one joint will solidify as the next is melted; pumps and solder wick are among methods to remove solder from all joints, leaving the part free to be removed.|$|E
5000|$|Terminology is {{not totally}} standardised. Anything with a base unit with {{provision}} {{to maintain a}} stable temperature, pump air in either direction, etc., is often called a [...] "station" [...] (preceded by rework, soldering, <b>desoldering,</b> hot air); one, or sometimes more, tools may be connected to a station, e.g., a rework station may accommodate a soldering iron and hot air head. A soldering iron with a hollow tip and a spring-, bulb-, or electrically-operated suction pump may be called a [...] Terms such as [...] "suction pen" [...] may be used; the meaning is usually clear from the context.|$|E
50|$|Veroboard {{is similar}} in concept and usage to plug-in breadboard, but is cheaper and more {{permanent}} - connections are soldered and while some limited reuse may be possible, {{more than a few}} cycles of soldering and <b>desoldering</b> are likely to render both the components and the board unusable. In contrast, breadboard connections are held by friction, and the breadboard can be reused many times. However, a breadboard is not very suitable for prototyping that needs to remain in a set configuration for an appreciable period of time nor for physical mock-ups containing a working circuit or for any environment subject to vibration or movement.|$|E
5000|$|Commonly {{referred}} to as a [...] "Chip-Off" [...] technique within the industry, the last and most intrusive method to get a memory image is to desolder the non-volatile memory chip and connect it to a memory chip reader. This method contains the potential danger of total data destruction: it is possible to destroy the chip and its content because of the heat required during <b>desoldering.</b> Before the invention of the BGA technology it was possible to attach probes to the pins of the memory chip and to recover the memory through these probes. The BGA technique bonds the chips directly onto the PCB through molten solder balls, such that it is no longer possible to attach probes.|$|E
50|$|Power is {{supplied}} to the ADC port by an additional finger connector {{on the video}} card, which plugs into a slot on the motherboard between the AGP slot and the back panel of the computer; on G4 Macs, some power is also sent through AGP pins 3 and 11. When ADC was introduced, AGP pins 3 and 11 were unassigned. In AGP 8x, pins 3 and 11 were assigned, so because of that, G4s are not directly compatible with AGP 8x. G5 Macs draw all power from the finger connector and therefore are 8x compatible. To use an AGP 8x card in a G4, pins 3 and 11 must be somehow disabled; {{this can be done}} by placing tape over the conductive part of the pin, slicing the PCB traces, or on some cards, <b>desoldering</b> surface mount resistors.|$|E
5000|$|Another problem arises {{after much}} {{use with the}} {{motherboard}} power connector; flap-like metal parts which contact {{the outside of the}} plug lose their tension and fail to make contact so that power does not reach the computer. The [...] "official" [...] solution is to replace the connector on the motherboard, which requires partial dis-assembly of the computer and <b>desoldering</b> a part with several pins; many companies charge a considerable sum for the work involved. Various simple alternatives have been suggested; for example a thin [...] "skin" [...] of solder {{on the outside of the}} barrel of the connector on the PSU (with care not to overheat the connector's plastic parts; and this thickened connector should not be used with other, not faulty Dell laptops, as it will stretch the springs and damage or even overheat the plug and socket assembly, causing them to melt or bond permanently).|$|E
