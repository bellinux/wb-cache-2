40|$|The {{fact that}} the rate of our {{national}} industrial growth has been markedly lower than expected since the beginning of this year has aroused universal concern among various circles. Because perceptions of the reasons for this phenomenon are different, the countermeasures that have been proposed differ considerably. On the one hand, in our view, the slowing down of the rate of industrial growth is the result of conscious control exercised over the "high-speed [growth]" through the adoption of various policy measures since last year and is therefore basically normal. Moreover, {{on the basis of the}} high-speed growth of last year, the 4. 4 percent average growth rate during the <b>first</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>year</b> is by no means low and does not warrant too much concern.

UK manufacturing in contrast appears to have arrested its decline even if it has not properly begun the process of recovery. Yet, the balance of later data suggests that the world economy is recovering led by the US and the non- Japanese Asian economies. But the growth performance of the Euro area remains weak. The UK economy after dicing with recession in the first quarter showed clear signs of picking up in the second quarter and subsequent developments have led to expectations that interest rates will have to rise if not at the end of this year then soon after the beginning of the next.

40|$|Much recent {{discussion}} {{has suggested that}} the official real GDP data are inadequately adjusted for recurring seasonal fluctuations. A similar pattern of insufficient seasonal adjustment also affects the published data for a key measure of price inflation. Still, such residual seasonality in the published output and inflation statistics is unlikely to mislead Federal Reserve policymakers or adversely affect the setting of monetary policy. Almost all economic data exhibit seasonal fluctuations—changes that occur around the same time each year due to such things as normal weather variation and holiday schedules. Because such variation obscures the underlying cyclical movements of the economy, most economic data are reported on a seasonally adjusted basis. Recently, a number of commentators have argued that the seasonal adjustment of real GDP by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) is incomplete and understates growth early in the year (see, for example, Rudebusch, Wilson, and Mahedy 2015). Indeed, since 1990, average real GDP growth has been significantly slower during {{the first three months of}} each year than in the subsequent quarters. Such “residual seasonality ” in the published seasonally adjusted real GDP data should be taken into account when assessing the state of the economy. Accordingly, the very weak readings on real GDP for the <b>first</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>year</b> have been a concern to Federal Reserve policymakers as they try to discer...|$|E

40|$|Since the <b>first</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>year</b> {{the labor}} market has tended to {{stabilize}} as output {{of goods and services}} has leveled off and prices have continued to show little change. The rate of decline in seasonally adjusted employment in nonagricultural establishments, which was sharp last fall and winter, has moderated considerably, and further reductions have been largely confined to durable goods manufacturing activities. The workweek in manufacturing has shown about the usual seasonal changes. Unemployment did not rise seasonally in June and July. At midyear, however, demands for labor were considerably easier than a year earlier, while the labor force was at a new high. The number of employees on nonfarm payrolls was 4 per cent, or 1. 9 million persons, below the record level of a year earlier. Overtime work was curtailed in many industries, and involuntary part-time work was more frequent. Agricultural employment also was down, continuing the decline of the postwar period, and the armed forces were reduced. Unemployment in July, at 3. 3 million persons, was more than double the very low level of a year earlier, and substantial labor surpluses were reported in a number of important industrial centers.

One consequence of the continuing and wide interest in, and study of, social attitudes has been a proliferation of attitude constructs as well as numerous scales designed to measure them.
