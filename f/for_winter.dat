5|$|After the {{appointment}} of Geoff Henke—who {{had been unable to}} compete in 1956 after the administrators neglected to endorse his ice hockey team's application—as team manager in 1976, the results slowly began to improve, and by the 1990s, some Australians were regarded as medal prospects. The upturn in performance was accompanied by increased government funding <b>for</b> <b>winter</b> sports, the creation of the Olympic Winter Institute of Australia and the purchase of an alpine training base in Austria.|$|E
5|$|Budget overruns {{are common}} for the Games. Average overrun for Games since 1960 is 156% in real terms, {{which means that}} actual costs {{turned out to be}} on average 2.56 times higher than the budget that was {{estimated}} at the time of winning the bid to host the Games. Montreal 1976 had the highest cost overrun for Summer Games, and for any Games, at 720%; Lake Placid 1980 had the highest cost overrun <b>for</b> <b>Winter</b> Games, at 324%. London 2012 had a cost overrun of 76%, Sochi 2014 of 289%.|$|E
5|$|By {{morning of}} January 3, Washington had reached Princeton. After a brief battle, the British there were decisively {{defeated}} and {{a substantial number}} of the garrison under command of Mawhood was captured. With their third defeat in ten days, Cornwallis' superior, General William Howe, ordered the army to withdraw from southern New Jersey and most of the way back to New York. This they did, leaving forward positions at New Brunswick. Washington moved his army to Morristown <b>for</b> <b>winter</b> quarters.|$|E

5|$|Helvellyn is {{a popular}} area <b>for</b> <b>winter</b> {{climbing}} in the Lake District. The steep headwall above Red Tarn contains several graded routes, clustered around the prow-shaped buttress {{on the right-hand side}} of the face, known to climbers as Viking Buttress, and in a couple of gullies which lead to the summit.|$|E
5|$|In June 1782 Hazen again had James Reid {{arrested on}} charges {{including}} disobedience and conduct unbecoming an officer. The court martial, held in December, {{resulted in a}} mistrial, with Hazen alleging bias {{on the part of}} the presiding judge advocate. After additional hearings, Reid was ultimately acquitted of the charges. In November 1782, the regiment was moved to Pompton, New Jersey, <b>for</b> <b>winter</b> quarters. Its duties during this time included the interdiction of trade between the countryside and the British in New York City.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 20th Century, an {{estimated}} $2 billion was spent annually in North America on roadway winter maintenance, owing to snow and other winter weather events, {{according to a}} 1994 report by Kuemmel. The study surveyed the practices of jurisdictions within 44 US states and nine Canadian provinces. It assessed the policies, practices, and equipment used <b>for</b> <b>winter</b> maintenance. It found similar practices and progress to be prevalent in Europe.|$|E

5|$|Most microbats are nocturnal while megabats are {{typically}} diurnal or crepuscular. In temperate areas, bats may migrate hundreds of kilometres to winter hibernation dens, while some pass into torpor in cold weather, rousing and feeding when warm weather allows for insects to be active. Others retreat to caves <b>for</b> <b>winter</b> and hibernate for six months. Microbats rarely fly in rain, it interferes with their echolocation, {{and they are}} unable to locate their food. A few species such as the New Zealand short-tailed bat and the common vampire bat are agile on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Mullsjö Municipality was {{newly created}} in 1952. The coat of arms, granted in 1977, was {{proposed}} by the municipality's recreation committee, to market the municipality as a center <b>for</b> <b>winter</b> sports. The snow crystal is a relatively modern charge, and the modern tree-top line, called kuusikoro in Finnish, is reflective of the Finnish influence on Swedish heraldry.

5|$|Nevado del Ruiz is one {{of several}} stratovolcanoes within Los Nevados National Natural Park, a {{national}} park located west of Bogotá in the centre of the Colombian Andes. The park is a popular tourist destination and contains several tourist shelters. The slopes of the volcano are used <b>for</b> <b>winter</b> sports, and nearby Lake Otún offers trout fishing. A number of commercially operated spas can be found nearby.|$|E

50|$|Established {{to protect}} habitat <b>for</b> <b>wintering</b> {{waterfowl}} and other migratory birds, Presquile {{is an important}} component in the network of refuges on and around the Chesapeake Bay, the largest estuary in the United States. Presquile historically provided important habitat <b>for</b> <b>wintering</b> Canada geese that breed along James Bay in eastern Canada. The refuge is also home to nesting and roosting bald eagles. The refuge is primarily hardwood swamp, with a fringe of marsh and 300 acre of upland fields.|$|R
5|$|The Austrian city of Innsbruck was {{the host}} in 1964. Although Innsbruck was a {{traditional}} winter sports resort, warm weather caused {{a lack of}} snow during the Games and the Austrian army was asked to transport snow and ice to the sport venues. Soviet speed-skater Lidia Skoblikova made history by sweeping all four speed-skating events. Her career total of six gold medals set a record <b>for</b> <b>Winter</b> Olympics athletes. Luge was first contested in 1964, although the sport received bad publicity when a competitor {{was killed in a}} pre-Olympic training run.|$|E
5|$|The Mont Blanc massif {{is now a}} {{significant}} tourist destination. The region attracts over sixmillion people per annum, with around one in five gaining access to its slopes by means of mechanical infrastructure (cable cars or funicular railways). Some surveys have shown that tourists mostly come to the Mont Blanc massif and its environs <b>for</b> <b>winter</b> sports such as skiing as well as summer outdoor activities like hiking, climbing and cycling.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinctive}} Black Watch Tartan of {{the college}} was introduced in 1918. Senior girls wore heavy box-pleated skirts and white blouses; junior girls wore pinafore dresses. All girls wore a navy blazer and heavy woollen stockings. Prefects also wore a special hat badge with a ring of bright blue enamel. A black felt Breton was introduced <b>for</b> <b>winter</b> use, and no change was made until {{the introduction of the}} green beret in 1952.|$|E

5000|$|The refuge is {{situated}} in open farmland near {{the confluence of the}} Santiam and Willamette rivers {{in the middle of the}} broad Willamette Valley. Elevations range between 180 and 290 feet (55 to 90 m) MSL. The Willamette Valley, with its mild, rainy winter climate, is an ideal environment <b>for</b> <b>wintering</b> waterfowl. The refuge consists of 2,796 acres (7.143 km2) of cropland, which provide forage <b>for</b> <b>wintering</b> geese, 600 acres (2.4 km2) of riparian zone forests, and 500 acres (2.0 km2) of shallow water seasonal wetlands.|$|R

5|$|The farmers' market {{opens in}} May {{and they are}} able to buy local honey to replace sugar. Seafood from the Strait of Georgia becomes a staple in their diet. The couple spend August at their cabin in northwestern BC where they fish the Skeena River, pick wild berries, and eat {{whatever}} grows in their garden. Back in the Lower Mainland, the September harvest provides them with melons, peppers, eggplant, grapes, and tomatoes. To prepare <b>for</b> <b>winter</b> they preserved corn and tomatoes, made jam from berries, collected herbs from their community garden, and bought many potatoes.|$|E
5|$|The fungus {{is rare in}} Europe and its {{distribution}} typically {{corresponds with}} high elevations {{at or near the}} alpine tree line. It is found in at least 11 countries, and has been included in the Red List of 8 countries. It is considered critically endangered in the Czech Republic. The European Council for Conservation of Fungi (ECCF) has suggested Suillus sibiricus be listed in Appendix II of the Bern Convention. Factors that threaten the habitat of S.sibiricus include deforestation and construction of skiing pistes and other infrastructure <b>for</b> <b>winter</b> sports.|$|E
5|$|The {{improvements}} {{of animal}} husbandry {{in the medieval}} period in Europe went {{hand in hand with}} other developments. Improvements to the plough allowed the soil to be tilled to a greater depth. Horses took over from oxen as the main providers of traction, new ideas on crop rotation were developed and the growing of crops <b>for</b> <b>winter</b> fodder gained ground. Peas, beans and vetches became common; they increased soil fertility through nitrogen fixation, allowing more livestock to be kept.|$|E
50|$|Other {{breeding}} birds found at Cemlyn include black-headed gull, ringed plover, oystercatcher and shelduck. The site is locally important <b>for</b> <b>wintering</b> wildfowl, with wigeon, shoveler and teal.|$|R
50|$|Aquatic {{habitats}} {{serve as}} resting and feeding areas <b>for</b> <b>wintering</b> waterfowl, while surrounding shrub-steppe and riparian corridors provide habitat for small mammals, mule deer, songbirds, and birds of prey.|$|R
