2500|$|<b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>cut</b> a {{left handed}} figure-8 Klein bottle it deconstructs into two left handed Möbius strips. [...] And {{similarly}} {{for the right}} handed figure-8 Klein bottle.|$|E
2500|$|The {{traditional}} Klein bottle embedding is achiral. The figure-8 embedding is chiral (the pinched torus embedding {{above is}} not regular {{as it has}} pinch points so it's not relevant in this section). [...] The three embeddings above cannot be smoothly transformed into each other in three dimensions. [...] <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>cut</b> the traditional Klein bottle lengthwise it deconstructs into two, oppositely chiral Möbius strips.|$|E
2500|$|Orzack later {{described}} the 40 percent figure as an unscientific estimate, {{based on a}} group study of gamers called the Daedalus project and conducted by Nick Yee in California. She {{then went on to}} add that it may still be 40 percent who are addicted, but that she was willing to [...] "cut back", concluding that [...] "If you take over eight million people who play World of Warcraft, even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>cut</b> it down to 10 to 15 per cent, that is a fair number of people".|$|E
6000|$|... "All right, Hans, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> have <b>cut</b> your ear-teeth we'll call it off," [...] said Dick, {{and here}} the {{conversation}} took a more rational turn.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, don't {{say such}} things as them, in a spear which is dewoted to {{something}} pleasanter,' urged Short. 'Respect associations, Tommy, even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> do <b>cut</b> up rough.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hold {{them up to}} the light, sir. There, {{they are}} quite bright and nice. In with them! Now, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>cut</b> some bread and butter it, we shall soon have our supper ready.' ...|$|R
2500|$|... "What {{would you}} do? Cut a great road through {{the law to}} get after the Devil? ... And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned round on you – where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat? This country is planted thick with laws from coast to coast, Man's laws, not God's, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>cut</b> them down – and you're just the man to do it – {{do you really think}} you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? Yes, I give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safety's sake!" ...|$|E
2500|$|No North American {{distribution}} {{agreement for}} the film had ever been reached due to myriad corporate and legal concerns on the parts of both the Japanese Toei Company and prospective North American studios, despite mutual interest. It was said in 2005 by a representative of a prospective U.S. distributor that Japanese executives from the Toei Company were advised by American lawyers who attended test screenings in the early 2000s that [...] "they'd go to jail" [...] had the film been mass-released in the USA at the time. In the company's best interests, Toei attached prohibitive rules, costs, and legal criteria to any possible North American distribution deal. Toei representative Hideyuki Baba stated {{that the reason for}} [...] "withholding distribution" [...] in North America was [...] "due to the picture's contents and theme." [...] A representative for a prospective US distributor criticised Toei for expecting a wide release like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon rather than a limited art house run, noting that [...] "in the US it will never get past the MPAA ratings board, and the major theater chains will never play it un-rated. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>cut</b> it enough to get an R rating there'd be nothing left." ...|$|E
60|$|MARTELLUS. It {{may not be}} nonsense. I daresay <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>cut</b> off her leg {{she would}} grow another, like the {{lobsters}} and the little lizards.|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot {{blame you}} for your being hard of faith, my lord," [...] said Jekyl; [...] "but still I think <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can <b>cut</b> out with your earldom, and your noble {{hereditary}} estate, I would, in your case, pitch Nettlewood to the devil." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{next thing}} {{will be to}} pull up the bamboos. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> have <b>cut</b> all their lashings, this {{ought not to be}} very difficult; but it will make it easier if we cut the ground away, as deep as we can, on this side of them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One only," [...] she {{answered}} composedly. [...] "I will pin it in here <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>cut</b> the stalk a little," [...] she added, removing a brooch from {{the bosom of}} her gown. [...] "Will you pay for this, please?" [...] she added, turning to Deane.|$|R
6000|$|He {{was going}} off, but she stopped him. [...] "You had better {{see how much}} we need, because <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>cut</b> too much, you may have some trouble to reach Las Palmas." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cut it off," [...] {{said the}} cook, {{trembling}} with impatience; [...] "I’ve earned forty pounds {{of it by}} coming so far. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>cut</b> it off I’ll send you ten of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I see! {{a jealous}} toad! I heard him {{telling her that}} you {{reminded}} him of her in old times. The spiteful vixen! Well, Phoebe, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>cut</b> her out, I bargain for board and lodging at Acton Manor. This will be {{no place for a}} quiet, meek soul like me!' ...|$|E
60|$|GEORGE.--I'll smash every {{glass in}} the room <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't; I'll <b>cut</b> my fingers; I'll poison myself--there! I'll eat all this sealing-wax <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't, and it's rank poison, you know it is.|$|R
6000|$|... "Holmes," [...] I said, [...] "you {{have drawn}} a net round this man {{from which he}} cannot escape, and you have saved an {{innocent}} human life as truly as <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had <b>cut</b> the cord which was hanging him. I see {{the direction in which}} all this points. The culprit is--" ...|$|R
60|$|The tree is down now, and {{you will}} want to be home in time for dinner. Farmer Brown's sled has just passed, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>cut</b> across the woods you can catch up with him, and have a ride home, and tell him all about the rabbit-hunt, on the way.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, lads," [...] Charley said briskly, [...] "we {{have got}} you, and you can't get away. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>cut</b> up rough, we'll {{have to leave}} you alone and the water will finish you. But if you're good we'll take you aboard, one man at a time, and you'll all be saved. What do you say?" ...|$|E
60|$|That is true. Nearly {{every time}} the {{audience}} roared I knew it was over {{something that would be}} condemned in the morning (justly, too) but must be left in--for low comedies are written for the drawing-room, the kitchen and the stable, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>cut</b> out the kitchen and the stable the drawing-room can't support the play by itself.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is early}} days. If {{you do not}} end it now, at once, it will only come harder on you presently. You know how {{determined}} he is. He will not change his mind. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>cut</b> him off from his work in life, it will but recoil on you. I can only expect your hatred, for talking like this, but believe me, it's for your good, as well as his, in the long run." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then the {{old woman}} went to a barber, and spoke to him, saying, 'I will give you all <b>you</b> ask <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will only <b>cut</b> off my head, so that I may become young and lovely.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't be {{for putting}} me off with such trash," [...] she returned, more passionately; [...] "you've murdered {{him as much}} as <b>if</b> <b>you</b> had <b>cut</b> his throat, and pretty nigh Master Walter into the bargain; and you've broke my lady's heart, you, as was born on her land and fed with her bread. And now you think to make up to me, do you?" ...|$|R
50|$|A {{large number}} of {{different}} gauges of strings can be used. Strings reside {{on top of the}} zero fret regardless of thickness, and have the same distance travel down to the first fret. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> have <b>cut</b> the grooves into the nut for thick strings, {{it may be necessary to}} change the nut out completely in order to go back to lighter gauge strings. On zero fret, this isn't needed.|$|R
6000|$|... "There are two; {{then that}} piqu, is all right, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>cut</b> the tail off the jacket {{and change the}} {{trimming}} a bit. The muslins only need mending and doing up to look as well as ever; you ought not to put them away torn and soiled, my child. The two black silks will be good stand-bys for years. If I were you, I 'd {{have a couple of}} neat, pretty prints for home-wear, and then I don't see why you are n't fixed well enough for our short season." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Attempts to do so, you mean!' {{answered}} Lancelot. 'But what if {{your religion}} preaches formally that which only remains in our religion as a fast-dying superstition?--That those judgments of God, as you call them, are not judgments at all in any fair use of the word, but capricious acts of punishment {{on the part of}} Heaven, which have no more reference to the fault which provokes them, than <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>cut</b> off a man's finger because he made a bad use of his tongue. That is part, but only a part, of what I meant just now, by saying that people represent God as capricious, proud, revengeful.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Pooh, pooh! {{the little}} monkey must love you. Why, you were her first playfellow; and I {{remember}} {{she used to}} cry <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>cut</b> your finger. Besides, she has always silently admitted that you were her lover. You know I have always spoken of you to her in that light. I {{took it for granted}} you had settled the business between yourselves; so did Anthony. Anthony thinks she's in love with you, and he has young eyes, which are apt enough to see clearly in these matters. He was talking to me about it this morning, and pleased me very much by the friendly interest he showed in you and Tina.' ...|$|E
5000|$|As [...] "I Can Hardly Wait" [...] {{was filmed}} during World War II, it {{contains}} references to wartime activities and propaganda, {{such as the}} Stooges working on fighter planes as defense workers and Moe’s reasoning for the dentist to have Curly’s broken tooth removed: “Listen, doc, we're defense workers. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> wanna <b>cut</b> down on absenteeism, yank this guy’s tooth! He won’t let us sleep, he’s sabotaging the war effort!” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! Mr Allfrey," [...] said Bradling, [...] "I am {{innocent}} of this; I am an escaped convict, it is true, and I {{did try to}} kill that man Dick, who has given me provocation enough, God knows, but, as He shall be my judge at last, I swear I did not commit this murder. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> will <b>cut</b> the cords that bind my hands, you will prevent a cold-blooded murder being committed now. You saved my life once before. Oh! save it again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Take {{the art of}} wood-carving,'Hal went on. He {{reached across}} the planks, grabbed a wooden mallet, and moved his other hand as though he wanted something. Mr Springett without a word passed him one of Dan's broad chisels. 'Ah! Wood-carving, for example. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> can <b>cut</b> wood and have a fair draft of what ye mean to do, a' Heaven's name take chisel and maul and let drive at it, say I! You'll soon find all the mystery, forsooth, of wood-carving under your proper hand!' Whack, came the mallet on the chisel, and a sliver of wood curled {{up in front of}} it. Mr Springett watched like an old raven.|$|R
6000|$|... "The man and {{his wife}} {{expressed}} such sympathy that I did not hesitate to say: 'I {{want to get rid of}} my coatee, and of this cloak. The coatee would be of no use to you, and you had best burn it, but the cloak, if you alter it, might be useful; or, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>cut</b> it up, will make a cover for your bed. I will give you that and a gold piece--it is a French one I got in the wars, but you can change it easily enough, when you go into the town marketing--if you will give me a suit of your clothes.' ...|$|E
6000|$|It was {{all very}} well to say [...] "drink me," [...] "but I'll look first," [...] said the wise little Alice, [...] "and see whether the bottle's marked [...] "poison" [...] or not," [...] for Alice had read several nice little stories about {{children}} that got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts, and other unpleasant things, because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had given them, such as, that, if {{you get into the}} fire, it will burn you, and that, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>cut</b> your finger very deeply with a knife, it generally bleeds, and she had never forgotten that, if you drink a bottle marked [...] "poison," [...] it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.|$|E
6000|$|Her {{companion}} {{saw from}} her manner {{that it was}} useless to urge her further by speech. [...] "As you are a trusty young woman," [...] he said, [...] "I'll put these sovereigns up here for ornament, that you may see how handsome they are. Bring the hair to-morrow, or return the sovereigns." [...] He stuck them edgewise into the frame of a small mantle looking-glass. [...] "I hope you'll bring it, for your sake and mine. I should have thought she could have suited herself elsewhere; but as it's her fancy it must be indulged if possible. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>cut</b> it off yourself, mind {{how you do it}} so as to keep all the locks one way." [...] He showed her how this was to be done.|$|E
2500|$|Gardiner ruled Council {{meetings}} strictly. He controlled {{procedural questions}} strictly, challenging dissident members to appeal his decisions, something no-one {{was able to}} do throughout his term. Members were scolded for talking inaudibly. Meetings went through agenda items quickly. Often, he would not pause to ask for dissenting votes. Leslie Frost commended his performance in 1956 by that stating that the success of Metro to date [...] "has been very largely dependent upon your own personality." [...] Nathan Phillips described his style: [...] "When he really wanted something, he just came and beat it out of you." [...] Philip Givens, who was on several occasions brought to tears, described Gardiner's temper as [...] "He {{scared the hell out of}} <b>you.</b> <b>If</b> he <b>cut</b> <b>you</b> up, he did it thoroughly. He eviscerated you, he left your entrails all over the floor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She's on the chute," [...] said Fessenden, [...] "and {{everything}} {{depends upon}} her own action whether {{she takes the}} plunge this winter or twenty years from now. She's a strong woman--or has been--but she has presumed upon her strength. She used to live out-of-doors, she tells me, during all her early life, and now, shut in by these walls, working sixteen hours a day, she is killing herself. Get her out <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can, and <b>cut</b> out stimulants." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Glad to see you, pard!" [...] {{said that}} gentleman, showing his white teeth and {{reaching}} up to clap his disengaged hand on Gabriel's shoulder. [...] "Glad to see <b>you,</b> old boy,--even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> have <b>cut</b> in and taken a job {{out of my}} hands that I was rather lyin' by to do myself. Sooner or later I'd have fetched that Mexican--if you hadn't dropped into my seat and taken up my hand. Oh, it's all right, Mack!" [...] he said, intercepting the quick look of caution that Maxwell darted at his client, [...] "don't do that. We're all friends here. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> want me to testify, I'll take my oath that there hasn't been a day this six months that that infernal hound, Ramirez, wasn't jest pantin' to be planted in his tracks! I can hardly believe I ain't done it myself." [...] He stopped, partly to enjoy the palpable uneasiness of Maxwell, and perhaps in some admiration of Gabriel's physique.|$|R
