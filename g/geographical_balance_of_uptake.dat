However, the source of the surfactant (palm kernel, coconut, or fossil resources) directly influences the importance of land use impact categories, especially natural land transformation. Moreover, for compliance with the WRI GHG protocol, ILCD and ISO 14040 / 44, any direct land use change occurring in the previous 20  years should be considered for above and below ground biomass and for soil organic matter (differentiated for peat and mineral soil). Therefore, we took into account the biogenic fraction of carbon dioxide emissions, both the uptake and release. As the cleaning products are short cyclic, the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>uptake</b> and release is zero.

40|$|The liver {{contains}} {{two types of}} galactose receptors, specific for Kupffer and parenchymal cells respectively. These receptors are only expressed in the liver, and therefore are attractive targets for the specific delivery of drugs. We provided low-density lipoprotein (LDL), a particle with a diameter of 23 nm in which a variety of drugs can be incorporated, with terminal galactose residues by lactosylation. Radioiodinated LDL, lactosylated to various extents (60 - 400 mol of lactose/ mol of LDL), was injected into rats. The plasma clearance and hepatic <b>uptake</b> <b>of</b> radioactivity were correlated with the extent of lactosylation. Highly lactosylated LDL (greater than 300 lactose/LDL) is completely cleared from the blood by liver within 10 min. Pre-injection with N-acetylgalactosamine blocks liver uptake, which indicates that the hepatic recognition sites are galactose-specific. The hepatic uptake occurs mainly by parenchymal and Kupffer cells. At a low degree of lactosylation, approx. 60 lactose/LDL, the specific <b>uptake</b> (ng/mg <b>of</b> cell protein) is 28 times higher in Kupffer cells than in parenchymal cells. However, because of their much larger mass, parenchymal cells are the main site <b>of</b> <b>uptake.</b> At high degrees of lactosylation (greater than 300 lactose/LDL), the specific uptake in Kupffer cells is 70 - 95 times that in parenchymal cells. Under these conditions, Kupffer cells are, despite their much smaller mass, the main site <b>of</b> <b>uptake.</b> Thus not only the size but also the surface density of galactose on lactosylated LDL {{is important for the}} <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> <b>uptake</b> between Kupffer and parenchymal cells.

The results were used of long-term stationary experiments conducted at the ÚKZUZ (Institute for Supervising and Testing in Agriculture) by means of lysimeter measurements and monitoring of meteorological data taking into account the respective production region. The trial plots are located {{in various parts of the}} Czech Republic therefore we can compare the results of experiments according to the soil-leaching regimes, various degree of fertilisation on arable land etc. Three crop rotations were evaluated (1989 - 1996, 1997 - 2004, 2005 - 2012). The most severe losses caused by washing out were losses of calcium, sulphates and nitrate N. In the case of N and K the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> nutrients (<b>uptake</b> [...] outflow) was in most cases negative with the exception of potato growing. This negative balance is based on the higher outflow (withdrawal by yields + washing-out losses) as compared to the lower input (nutrient uptake from fertilisers + precipitation). The balance was more negative in the BVO (potato growing region) with a soil-leaching phase than in the ŘVO (sugar-beet growing region) where the soil-leaching regime was periodic.

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of current energy and climate policies, several regional and federal measures are being implemented in Belgium to encourage the utilization of biofuels for automotive applications. The use of biomass for power and/or heat production also gets growing support through CHP and/or CO 2 certificates and most probably through new upcoming European directives. As a result, many investors, policy makers and energy companies are investigating these so-called biomass routes and there is definitely a need to gain more insight in this complex matter. This paper presents an analysis and comparison {{of the most promising}} options for utilizing the limited biomass resources in Belgium. To allow for a systematic comparison, a new method called System Perturbation Analysis (SPA) was developed. SPA differs from a classical Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) mainly because it looks to <b>geographical</b> system <b>balances</b> <b>of</b> resources and the resulting effects, rather than comparing well-to-wheel trajectories. Therefore SPA is able to identify the best usage of limited resources such as hectares, wood waste or imports, in terms of fossil energy savings or GHG emissions within a given system (in casu: Belgium). Comparative results of such a SPA assessment are presented and discussed in this paper, including the use of wood for transport, heat and power applications.

We hypothesized that the combination of hypercholesterolemia and defective cholesterol efflux would promote HSPC expansion and leukocytosis more prominently than either alone. We crossed Ldlr(-/-) with Apoa 1 (-/-) mice and found that compared to Ldlr(-/-) mice, Ldlr(-/-) /Apoa 1 (+/-) mice, with similar LDL-cholesterol levels but reduced HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, had expansion of HSPCs, monocytosis and neutrophilia. Ex vivo studies showed that HSPCs expressed high levels of Ldlr, Scarb 1 (Srb 1), and Lrp 1 and were able to take up both native and oxidized LDL. Native LDL directly stimulated HSPC proliferation, while co-incubation with reconstituted HDL attenuated this effect. We also assessed the impact of HDL-C levels on monocytes in children with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) (n = 49) and found that subjects with the lowest level of HDL-C, had increased monocyte counts compared to the mid and higher HDL-C levels. Overall, HDL-C was inversely correlated with the monocyte count.

Copper is an essential cofactor of enzymes involved in a variety of important metabolic processes including ATP production, iron transport, and antioxidant defense. The maintenance of copper homeostasis requires a <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> copper <b>uptake</b> and export, as well as the appropriate partitioning of copper between the cytoplasm, mitochondria and secretory compartments. Although many of the proteins involved in copper homeostasis have been identified, it is unknown whether specific pathophysiological conditions lead to compensatory changes in the intracellular copper distribution. In this study, we identify changes in copper homeostasis in response to pro-inflammatory mediators. We also show a novel role for the copper-transporting ATPase, ATP 7 A, in the bactericidal activity of RAW 264. 7 macrophage cell. We also identify striking alterations in copper homeostasis in response to hypoxia in RAW 264. 7 macrophage cells. In response to hypoxia, we observe a change in the hierarchy of intracellular distribution favoring delivery of copper to ATP 7 A and to the secretory pathway, as evidenced by enhanced activity of the ferroxidase, ceruloplasmin, and by copper-dependent trafficking of ATP 7 A in hypoxic macrophages in vitro and in vivo.
