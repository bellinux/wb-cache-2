5|$|A {{native of}} Van, {{one of the}} largest cities <b>in</b> <b>Turkish</b> (Western) Armenia, Khrimian became a celibate priest (vardapet) in 1854 {{after the death of his}} wife and daughter. In the 1850s and 1860s he served as the abbot of two {{important}} monasteries <b>in</b> <b>Turkish</b> Armenia: Varagavank near Van and Surb Karapet Monastery near Mush. During this period he established schools and journals in both monasteries. He served as Patriarch of Constantinople—the most influential figure within the Ottoman Armenian community—from 1869 to 1873 and resigned due to pressure from the Ottoman government which saw him as a threat. He was the head of the Armenian delegation at the 1878 Congress of Berlin. Returning from Europe, he encouraged Armenian peasants to follow the example of Christian Balkan peoples by launching an armed struggle for autonomy or independence from the Ottoman Turks.|$|E

A person from the city is an İstanbullu (plural: İstanbullular), although Istanbulite is used in English.|$|E

5000|$|Oğuz is {{a common}} {{masculine}} Turkish given name. There are various theories {{on the meaning of}} [...] "Oğuz". The most prominent explanation is that it is composed of [...] "ok" [...] and [...] "z". <b>In</b> (modern) <b>Turkish</b> and proto Turkish [...] "ok" [...] means [...] "arrow". Only <b>in</b> proto <b>Turkish,</b> [...] "ok" [...] also means [...] "clan", and/or [...] "nation". Again, only <b>in</b> proto <b>Turkish,</b> [...] "z" [...] is the plural suffix. <b>In</b> modern <b>Turkish</b> [...] "z" [...] is not the plural suffix anymore. Actually, it is not a suffix, in general, <b>in</b> modern <b>Turkish.</b> Therefore [...] "okz" [...] means [...] "clans", [...] "nations", and/or [...] "arrows".|$|R
5|$|The country's tumultuous {{transition}} to multiparty democracy {{was interrupted by}} military coups d'état in 1960, 1971, and 1980, {{as well as a}} military memorandum in 1997.

5|$|The {{wood of the}} bending part of {{the limb}} ("dustar") must endure intense {{shearing}} stress, and denser woods such as hard maples are normally used <b>in</b> <b>Turkish</b> bows. Bamboo, and wood of the mulberry family, are traditional in China. Some composite bows have nonbending tips ("siyahs"), which need to be stiff and light; they may be made of woods such as Sitka spruce.|$|E
5|$|According to a myth in many cultures, cats have {{multiple}} lives. In many countries, they {{are believed to}} have nine lives, but in Italy, Germany, Greece, Brazil and some Spanish-speaking regions, they are said to have seven lives, while <b>in</b> <b>Turkish</b> and Arabic traditions, the number of lives is six. The myth is attributed to the natural suppleness and swiftness cats exhibit to escape life-threatening situations. Also lending credence to this myth is the fact that falling cats often land on their feet, using an instinctive righting reflex to twist their bodies around. Nonetheless, cats can still be injured or killed by a high fall.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{the word}} used here, [...] "ırk", means [...] "race" [...] <b>in</b> {{contemporary}} <b>Turkish,</b> it had different associations <b>in</b> Ottoman <b>Turkish.</b> <b>In</b> Ottoman <b>Turkish,</b> it also carries the connotations of [...] "generation", [...] "offspring", and [...] "family lineage"; in short, [...] "kin". Also {{note that the}} poet was of Albanian and Uzbek origin. Thus, the correct translation is [...] "Smile upon my heroic kinfolk", rather than [...] "Smile upon my heroic race".|$|R
5|$|Despite this support, the {{economic}} {{resources of the}} Ottoman Empire were depleted by {{the cost of the}} Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913 and the French, British and Germans had offered financial aid. A pro-German faction influenced by Enver Pasha, the former Ottoman military attaché in Berlin, opposed the pro-British majority in the Ottoman cabinet and tried to secure closer relations with Germany. In December 1913, the Germans sent a military mission to Constantinople, headed by General Otto Liman von Sanders. The geographical position of the Ottoman Empire meant that Russia and her allies France and Britain had a significant interest <b>in</b> <b>Turkish</b> neutrality in the event of war in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Even {{during the}} Cold War, the {{psychological}} {{impact of a}} battleship was significant. In 1946, USS Missouri was dispatched to deliver {{the remains of the}} ambassador from Turkey, and her presence <b>in</b> <b>Turkish</b> and Greek waters staved off a possible Soviet thrust into the Balkan region. In September 1983, when Druze militia in Lebanon's Shouf Mountains fired upon U.S. Marine peacekeepers, the arrival of USS New Jersey stopped the firing. Gunfire from New Jersey later killed militia leaders.|$|E

5|$|Many motifs {{are used}} in {{traditional}} kilims, handmade flat-woven rugs, each with many variations. <b>In</b> <b>Turkish</b> Anatolia in particular, village women wove themes significant for their lives into their rugs, whether before marriage or during married life. Some motifs represent desires, such as for happiness and children; others, for protection against threats such as wolves (to the flocks) and scorpions, or against the evil eye. These motifs were often combined when woven into patterns on kilims. With the fading of tribal and village cultures in the 20th century, the meaning of kilim patterns has faded also.|$|E

5|$|The Armenian {{language}} has two distinct standardized forms: Western Armenian and Eastern Armenian, both widely spoken among the Armenian American community. Armenians from Lebanon, Turkey, Syria and few other countries speak the Western dialect, which was spoken <b>in</b> <b>Turkish</b> (Western) Armenia, the eastern regions of Turkey with historical Armenian presence. Eastern Armenian is primarily spoken in the Republic of Armenia and Iran, though the Iranian Armenians {{have their own}} dialect. Furthermore, Western and Eastern Armenian use two different spellings. In Armenia, the reformed orthography is used, while most Armenians in the diaspora (including Lebanon, Syria, Turkey and Iran) use the classical orthography.|$|E
5|$|The {{definite}} Albanian form of {{the name}} of city is Gjirokastra, while in the Gheg Albanian dialect it is known as Gjinokastër, both of which derive from the Greek name. Alternative spellings found in Western sources are Girokaster and Girokastra. In Aromanian the city is known as Ljurocastru, while in modern Greek it is known Αργυρόκαστρο (Argyrokastro). During the Ottoman era the town was known <b>in</b> <b>Turkish</b> as Ergiri.|$|E
5|$|Anachronism {{is a major}} {{component}} of The Battle of Alexander at Issus. By dressing Alexander's men in 16th-century steel armour and Darius' men <b>in</b> <b>Turkish</b> battle dress, Altdorfer draws deliberate parallels between the Macedonian campaign and the contemporary European–Ottoman conflict. In 1529 – the year of the painting's commissioning – the Ottoman forces under Suleiman the Magnificent laid siege to the Austrian city of Vienna. Then also the capital of the Holy Roman Empire and called 'the golden apple' by the Sultans. Although far inferior in number, the Austrian, German, Czech, and Spanish soldiers marshalled to defend Vienna were able to force the enemy into a retreat and stall the Ottoman advance on central Europe. It is probable the painting's underlying allegory was inspired by the siege of Vienna, given its similarities to Alexander's victory at Issus. Some critics go further, suggesting that the inclusion of anachronism may have been an element of Altdorfer's commission.|$|E
