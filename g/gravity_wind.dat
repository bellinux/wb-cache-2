5|$|The Mk 8 Rangekeeper was an {{electromechanical}} {{analog computer}} whose function was to continuously calculate the gun's bearing and elevation, Line-Of-Fire (LOF), {{to hit a}} future position of the target. It did this by automatically receiving information from the director (LOS), the FC Radar (range), the ship's gyrocompass (true ship's course), the ship's Pitometer log (ship's speed), the Stable Vertical (ship's roll and pitch), and the ship's anemometer (relative wind speed and direction). Also, before the surface action started, the FTs made manual inputs for the average initial velocity of the projectiles fired out of the battery's gun barrels, and air density. With all this information, the Rangekeeper calculated the relative motion between the ship and the target. It then could calculate an offset angle and change of range between the target's present position (LOS) and future position {{at the end of}} the projectile's time of flight. To this bearing and range offset, it added corrections for <b>gravity,</b> <b>wind,</b> Magnus effect of the spinning projectile, earth's curvature, and coriolis effect. The result was the turret's bearing and elevation orders (LOF). During the surface action, range and deflection Spots and target altitude (not zero during Gun Fire Support) were manually entered.|$|E

50|$|Most cycling power meters use {{strain gauges}} to measure torque applied, and when {{combined}} with angular velocity, calculate power. Power meters using strain gauges are mounted in the bottom bracket, rear freehub, or crankset. Certain newer devices do not use strain gauges and instead measure power through handlebar-mounted units that utilize the principles of Newton's Third Law by measuring a cyclist's opposing forces (<b>gravity,</b> <b>wind</b> resistance, inertia, rolling resistance) and combining these with velocity to determine the rider's power output.|$|E

50|$|Phycomyces can {{reproduce}} via {{extension of}} mycelia, or by production of spores either asexually or sexually. The asexual cycle includes {{the formation of}} spore containing sporangia borne {{on the top of}} sporangiophores that may extend 10 to 15 cm above the surface of the fungal colony from which they emerged. The long filamentous sporangiophores respond to divergent environmental signals including light, <b>gravity,</b> <b>wind,</b> chemicals and adjacent objects. The sporangia contain vegetative spores with one to six haploid nuclei. These spores when dispersed can establish new colonies.|$|E
50|$|One of Computer and Structure, Inc.'s software, ETABS, {{was used}} to create the {{mathematical}} model of the Burj Khalifa, currently the world's tallest building, designed by Chicago, Illinois-based Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP (SOM). In the Structural analysis section of their December 2009 Structural Engineer magazine article entitled Design and construction of the world's tallest building: The Burj Dubai, since renamed to Burj Khalifa, William F. Baker, S.E. and James J. Pawlikowski, S.E. mention that <b>gravity,</b> <b>wind,</b> and seismic response were all characterized using ETABS. Further, ETABS' geometric nonlinear capability provided for P-Delta Effect consideration.|$|E
50|$|Seed {{dispersal}} is {{the movement}} or transport of seeds {{away from the}} parent plant. Plants have limited mobility and consequently rely upon a variety of dispersal vectors to transport their propagules, including both abiotic and biotic vectors. Seeds can be dispersed away from the parent plant individually or collectively, as well as dispersed in both space and time. The patterns of seed dispersal are determined {{in large part by}} the dispersal mechanism and this has important implications for the demographic and genetic structure of plant populations, as well as migration patterns and species interactions. There are five main modes of seed dispersal: <b>gravity,</b> <b>wind,</b> ballistic, water and by animals.|$|E

50|$|Structural {{engineers}} {{ensure that}} buildings and bridges are built {{to be strong}} enough and stable enough to resist all appropriate structural loads (e.g., <b>gravity,</b> <b>wind,</b> snow, rain, seismic (earthquake), earth pressure, temperature, and traffic) {{in order to prevent}} or reduce loss of life or injury. They also design structures to be stiff enough to not deflect or vibrate beyond acceptable limits. Human comfort is an issue that is regularly considered in the limits. Fatigue is also an important consideration for bridges and for aircraft design or for other structures which experience a large number of stress cycles over their lifetimes. Consideration is also given to durability of materials against possible deterioration which may impair performance over the design lifetime.|$|E

Plants have very limited mobility and consequently rely upon a variety of dispersal vectors to transport their propagules, including both abiotic and biotic vectors. Seeds can be dispersed away from the parent plant individually or collectively, as well as dispersed in both space and time. The patterns of seed dispersal are determined {{in large part by}} the dispersal mechanism and this has important implications for the demographic and genetic structure of plant populations, as well as [...] patterns and species interactions. There are five main modes of seed dispersal: <b>gravity,</b> <b>wind,</b> ballistic, water, and by animals. Some plants are serotinous and only disperse their seeds in response to an environmental stimulus.|$|E
50|$|Phycomyces blakesleeanus is a {{filamentous}} fungus in the Order Mucorales of the phylum Zygomycota or subphylum Mucoromycotina. The spore-bearing sporangiophores of Phycomyces {{are very sensitive}} to different environmental signals including light, <b>gravity,</b> <b>wind,</b> chemicals and adjacent objects. They exhibit phototropic growth: most Phycomyces research has focused on sporangiophore photobiology, such as phototropism and photomecism ('light growth response'). Metabolic, developmental, and photoresponse mutants have been isolated, some of which have been genetically mapped. At least ten different genes (named madA through to madJ) are required for phototropism. The madA gene encodes a protein related to the White Collar 1 class of photoreceptors that are present in other fungi, while madB encodes a protein related to the White Collar 2 protein that physically bind to White collar 1 to participate in the responses to light.|$|E

However, since his Null field can negate <b>gravity</b> and <b>wind,</b> he can {{literally}} walk on air, via directed motion hovering.|$|R
50|$|The unique {{conditions}} in the Dry Valleys are caused, in part, by katabatic winds; these occur when cold, dense air is pulled downhill {{by the force of}} <b>gravity.</b> The <b>winds</b> can reach speeds of 320 km/h, heating as they descend, and evaporating all water, ice and snow.|$|R
