25|$|In the 1960s the {{modernisation}} of {{the railways}} {{was on the}} agenda, and consideration {{was given to the}} Glasgow suburban network. In fact the North Clyde lines were electrified from 1960. From Neilston to Newton the former L line was in the area of suburban travel, but Uplawmoor was rural, and it was decided to electrify the Neilston and Newton lines on the 25kV ac system which was then becoming the standard. Cathcart Junction and station were altered (on 6 March 1961) so as to give access towards Kirkhill and Newton from Maxwell Park, and an <b>electrical</b> <b>control</b> room was built at Cathcart. Neilston and Newton were to be treated as two branches served from Glasgow Central. Public service on these routes started on 27 May 1962. The steam service to Uplawmoor had been withdrawn on 2 April 1962.|$|E

2500|$|Most diesel {{locomotives}} {{are capable of}} multiple unit operation (MU) {{as a means of}} increasing horsepower and tractive effort when hauling heavy trains. All North American locomotives, including export models, use a standardized AAR <b>electrical</b> <b>control</b> system interconnected by a 27-pin jumper cable between the units. For UK-built locomotives, a number of incompatible control systems are used, but the most common is the Blue Star system, which is electro-pneumatic and fitted to most early diesel classes. A small number of types, typically higher-powered locomotives intended for passenger only work, do not have multiple control systems. In all cases, the <b>electrical</b> <b>control</b> connections made common to all units in a consist are referred to as trainlines. [...] The result is that all locomotives in a consist behave as one in response to the engine driver's control movements.|$|E

It should be noted however that this feature is often seen as more of a hindrance than help in race applications. The system tends to favor less advanced drivers, and can make the rear suspension unstable during high speed cornering. For this reason many kits are available to override this system. These kits usually loop the hydraulic lines back on themselves on the R32. Kits for the R33/34 models use a simple lock out bar—or a Tomei kit, which also alters the <b>electrical</b> <b>control</b> system ( [...] the 33 and 34 had electronic HICAS).
