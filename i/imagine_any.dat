25|$|In Shusterman’s and, also, Dewey's opinion, {{the eastern}} {{meditation}} practices repair perception for understanding {{our dependence on}} the society’s moral order. Shusterman underlines that even if, as Rorty claims, Wilfrid Sellars’s critique of {{the myth of the}} given proves that immediate, non-discursive somatic experience cannot be integrated into epistemology, it does not preclude that this experience may be usefully deployed in philosophy as such, because to think otherwise would be to wrongly conflate all philosophy with one of its sub-disciplines, i.e. theory of cognition. And the fact that we can hardly <b>imagine</b> <b>any</b> form of application of the immediate somatic experience in the realm of philosophy is not a proof that this is impossible, but rather indicates that our conception of philosophy is dominated by an idealistic paradigm, naturally hostile to the body as such. The will to change this situation {{has been one of the}} reasons why Shusterman developed a philosophical sub-discipline devoted to the body and its experience: Somaesthetics.|$|E

[...] Scott Feinberg, of the Los Angeles Times, criticized the concept of Downey's portrayal of an African-American, writing [...] "...I just can't <b>imagine</b> <b>any</b> circumstance under which a blackface performance would be acceptable, any more than I can <b>imagine</b> <b>any</b> circumstance under which {{the use of the}} N-word would be acceptable." [...] Sara Vilkomerson said Cruise did [...] "...an astonishingly funny and surprising supporting performance." [...] Logan Hill of New York argued against Cruise's cameo saying that it [...] "...just makes him look a little lost and almost pathetic—shucking and jiving, trying to appeal to the younger moviegoers who are abandoning him." ...|$|E

Of the break-up, People quoted her telling Elle magazine, [...] "I didn't know where to go. I couldn't <b>imagine</b> <b>any</b> {{place in the world}} that was gonna feel good to me." [...] After Ledger's death from a combined drug intoxication (CDI) in January 2008, the usually under-the-radar actress and her daughter became an interest of the media and were often followed by paparazzi. As a result, Williams rarely gave interviews until the end of 2009.|$|E

[...] Swift's friend, Dr. John Arbuthnot, claimed, [...] "I can never <b>imagine</b> <b>any</b> man can be uneasy, that has the opportunity of venting himself to a whole congregation once a week."

500|$|Donkey Kong Jr. Math had a poor {{reception}} from IGN, with Lucas M.

Shea also included it on his list of the worst Virtual Console games, finding it difficult to <b>imagine</b> <b>any</b> reason why anyone would want to buy it. GameSpot's Frank Provo found that it became boring quickly, also criticizing the mathematics problems for being either too easy for young children or too boring for older ones. Eurogamer's Dan Whitehead commented that it gave him an [...] "ironic smile" [...] as a reminder of the NES era, though he could not justify paying five dollars for it.|$|E

500|$|As the Spice Girls’ debut single, [...] "Wannabe" [...] {{has been}} {{credited}} for catapulting the band to global stardom and ushering in [...] "Spicemania" [...] {{in the late}} 1990s. Commentators have noted that the song and its accompanying video, both now considered modern pop classics, served as a wonderful introduction to the band. The Metro's Jon O’Brien concluded that: “From its lyrical themes of female solidarity to its insanely catchy pop hooks and mischief-making promo, the worldwide chart-topper encapsulated everything that made the group so spellbinding {{in the space of}} just two minutes and 52 seconds.” Digital Spy's Lewis Corner agreed, adding: [...] "It's hard to <b>imagine</b> <b>any</b> other pop act managing to make this much of an impact so quickly and effortlessly ever again." ...|$|E
500|$|Response to Episode One was {{generally}} positive, and reviewers praised {{the game for}} having more intricate, well-paced gameplay than Half-Life 2. The game's interactivity, particularly {{in the form of}} Alyx and her reactions to the player's actions and the events of the game, was also singled out for praise. PC Gamer commented that [...] "while this inaugural episode may not be the essential FPS that Half-Life2 is, I can't <b>imagine</b> <b>any</b> shooter fan who'd want to miss it." [...] In its review, PC Gamer UK directed particular praise to the balance between puzzle-oriented and action-oriented challenges throughout the game. In Australia, the magazine PC PowerPlay awarded the game 10 out of 10. Edge praised the [...] "deftness" [...] with which the game was able to direct the player's eyes, and the strength of Alyx as a companion, concluding, [...] "In an interactive genre bound to the traditions of the pop-up gun and invisible hero, it simply doesn't get more sophisticated than this." [...] Episode One earned a scores of 87/100 and 85.59% on review aggregators Metacritic and GameRankings respectively. IGN awarded Episode One with the title of [...] "Best PC FPS of 2006" [...] and described it as a [...] "great bang for the buck using Valve's new episodic plan", although it did not offer [...] "the complete experience that Half-Life2 was". GameSpy ranked Episode One ninth on its 2006 [...] "Games of the Year" [...] list, and it also noted the implementation of Alyx as a believable and useful companion.|$|E
500|$|Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly {{called the}} novel a [...] "big-hearted, restless story" [...] and rated it an A minus. Lisa Zeidner of The Washington Post opined that Middlesex [...] "provides not only incest à la Ada and a Lolita-style road trip, but enough dense detail to keep fans of close reading manically busy." [...] Tami Hoag of People concurred, writing that [...] "this feast {{of a novel}} is thrilling in the scope of its {{imagination}} and surprising in its tenderness". Andrew O'Hehir of Salon agreed, praising Middlesex as an [...] "epic and wondrous" [...] novel filled with numerous characters and historical occurrences. Mendelsohn praised Middlesex for its [...] "dense narrative, interwoven with sardonic, fashionably postmodern commentary." [...] However, he criticized the novel as a disjointed hybrid. He wrote Eugenides was successful {{with the story of}} the Greek immigrants, which he described as [...] "authenti", but mishandled the hermaphrodite material, which Mendelsohn characterized as [...] "unpersuasiv". The Economist review stated that a more concise, concentrated depiction of hermaphroditism would have made the book more [...] "fun to read". Jeff Zaleski of Publishers Weekly praised Eugenides' portrayal of the girl, Callie, and the man Cal. Zaleski wrote that [...] "t's difficult to <b>imagine</b> <b>any</b> serious male writer of earlier eras so effortlessly transcending the stereotypes of gender." [...] Paul Quinn of Contemporary Literary Criticism commended the novel, writing: [...] "That Eugenides manages to move us without sinking into sentiment shows how successfully he has avoided the tentacles of irony which grip so many writers of his generation." [...] Christina McCarroll of The Christian Science Monitor wrote that [...] "Eugenides wrangles with a destiny that mutates and recombines like restless chromosomes, in a novel of extraordinary flexibility, scope, and emotional depth." ...|$|E

500|$|Oblivions {{score was}} {{composed}} by series mainstay Jeremy Soule, {{a video game}} composer whose past scores had earned him a British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) award in the [...] "Game Music Category" [...] and two nominations for an Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences (AIAS) award for [...] "Original Music Composition". The official soundtrack to Oblivion, featuring 26 tracks spanning 58 minutes; it was released in March 2006, via Soule's digital distributor DirectSong. Soule had worked with Bethesda and Todd Howard during the creation of Morrowind, and, in a press release announcing his return for Oblivion, Soule repeated the words he had said during Morrowinds press release: [...] "The stunning, epic quality of The Elder Scrolls series is particularly compatible with the grand, orchestral style of music I enjoy composing the most". As in his compositions for Morrowind, Soule chose to create a soft and minimalist score {{so as not to}} wear out users' ears. Soule stated that while composing the music he did not <b>imagine</b> <b>any</b> specific characters or events; rather, he wanted it [...] "to comment on the human condition and the beauty of life". In a 2006 interview, he related that this desire came {{as a result of a}} car accident that occurred during his composition of the score. He said, [...] "I ended up rolling in my car several times on an interstate while flying headlong into oncoming traffic ... I felt no fear ... I simply just acknowledged to myself that I've had a good life and I would soon have to say goodbye to all of it in a matter of seconds". Soule sustained only minor injuries, but commented that his feeling during the crash—"that life is indeed precious"—remained with him throughout the rest of the composition.|$|E

2500|$|The {{reference}} {{points for the}} lyrics of The Scream were J. G. Ballard and William Burroughs. In a track such as [...] "Suburban Relapse", the band wrote about suburbia, where they were born and raised. Steven Severin emphasized: [...] "That's why J.G. Ballard resonated so much with us, because all his near-future tales were set in this bizarre suburban wasteland. Suburbia {{is a place where}} you can <b>imagine</b> <b>any</b> kind of possibility, because there's space, not urban clutter".|$|E
2500|$|The Chinese Wall Theory {{essentially}} {{rests on}} a cost benefit hypothesis, where the Ming recognized the highly resistant nature of their walls to structural damage, and could not <b>imagine</b> <b>any</b> affordable development of the guns available to {{them at the time}} to be capable of breaching said walls. Even as late as the 1490s a Florentine diplomat considered the French claim that [...] "their artillery is capable of creating a breach in a wall of eight feet in thickness" [...] to be ridiculous and the French [...] "braggarts by nature."

2500|$|In a Western context, Rosenau cites a British Secret Intelligence Service {{definition}} as [...] "a generalized {{intention to}} (emphasis added) [...] "overthrow or undermine parliamentary democracy by political, industrial or violent means." [...] While insurgents {{do not necessarily}} use terror, {{it is hard to}} <b>imagine</b> <b>any</b> insurgency meeting its goals without undermining aspects of the legitimacy or power of the government or faction it opposes. Rosenau mentions a more recent definition that suggests subversion includes measures short of violence, which still serve the purposes of insurgents. Rarely, subversion alone can change a government; this arguably happened in the liberalization of Eastern Europe. To the Communist government of Poland, Solidarity appeared subversive but not violent.|$|E

2500|$|Romney {{may have}} been {{challenged}} by voters with the concern that a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints would take commandments {{from the president of}} the church who is regarded as a living prophet. In an interview aired on Fox News Romney said, [...] "America has a political religion, which is to place the oath of office, an oath to abide by a nation of laws and the Constitution, above all others. And there's no question that I make that my primary responsibility." [...] Mike Otterson, an LDS spokesman, said, [...] "The suggestion that a Mormon leader would dictate policy to a President Romney is absurd.

Philip D.
