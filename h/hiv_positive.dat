5|$|Measures {{to prevent}} {{opportunistic}} infections {{are effective in}} many people with HIV/AIDS. In addition to improving current disease, treatment with antiretrovirals {{reduces the risk of}} developing additional opportunistic infections. Adults and adolescents who are living with HIV (even on anti-retroviral therapy) with no evidence of active tuberculosis in settings with high tuberculosis burden should receive isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT), the tuberculin skin test can be used to help decide if IPT is needed. Vaccination against hepatitis A and B is advised for all people at risk of HIV before they become infected; however it may also be given after infection. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis between four and six weeks of age and ceasing breastfeeding in infants born to <b>HIV</b> <b>positive</b> mothers is recommended in resource limited settings. It is also recommended to prevent PCP when a person's CD4 count is below 200cells/uL and in those who have or have previously had PCP. People with substantial immunosuppression are also advised to receive prophylactic therapy for toxoplasmosis and MAC. Appropriate preventive measures have reduced the rate of these infections by 50% between 1992 and 1997. Influenza vaccination and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine are often recommended in people with HIV/AIDS with some evidence of benefit.|$|E

The activation state of NK cells in terms of cytokine response (IFNγ & TNFα) was significantly higher in ESNs compared to the healthy controls, recently infected HIV+ and chronically infected HIV+.

Increased activation status of NK cells and pDC in Exposed but Seronegative individuals indicates their continuous stimulation with HIV antigens due to regular exposure with infected partners and which might be imparting resistance to viral infection in these individuals...|$|R

40|$|Background: The Tanzanian {{national}} HIV {{care and}} treatment programme has provided free antiretroviral therapy (ART) to HIV-positive persons since 2004.

Methods: The Kisesa Health and Demographic Surveillance Site (HDSS) has collected HIV serological data and demographic data, including verbal autopsy (VA) interviews since 1994. Serological data to the end of 2010 were used to make two estimates of HIV-attributable mortality, the first among <b>HIV</b> <b>positives</b> using the difference in mortality between <b>HIV</b> <b>positives</b> and <b>HIV</b> negatives, and the second in the population using the difference between the observed mortality rate in the whole population and the mortality rate among the HIV negatives.

Free HIV care including ART has been available since 2005. Event history {{analysis was used to}} compare mortality rates among HIV-negative and HIV-positive adults in the 5 -year period before and after the introduction of ART. Crude and adjusted hazard ratios were calculated using exponential regression models. Interaction between time period and HIV status was assessed to investigate whether there was a non-linear relationship between these two variables. results Male and female mortality patterns varied over the pre- and post-ART period. In women, the crude death rate fell for both HIV negatives and <b>HIV</b> <b>positives</b> hazard rate ratio (HRR = 0. 71; 95 %CI 0. 51 – 0. 99 and HRR = 0. 68; 95 %CI: 0. 46 – 0. 99, respectively). For men, the mortality among the HIV negatives increased (HRR = 1. 47; 95 %CI: 1. 06 – 2. 03) while the decline in mortality among the <b>HIV</b> <b>positives</b> (HRR = 0. 77; 95 %CI 0. 52 – 1. 13) was not statistically significant. The largest decrease in HIV-positive mortality over the two periods was among the 30 - to 44 -year-old age group for women and among the 45 - to 59 -year-old age group for men. conclusion There has been a modest effect on mortality in the study population following the introduction of free ART 5 years ago. Improving access to treatment and placing greater focus on retaining individuals on treatment are essential if the full potential of treatment for reducing HIV-related mortality is to be realised...|$|R
40|$|UNLABELLED: The {{presence}} of autonomic dysfunction in HIV patients is largely unknown. Early studies found autonomic dysfunction {{in patients with}} AIDS. Antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) has dramatically {{changed the course of}} the disease and improved prognosis and decreased morbidity. AIM: To evaluate whether autonomic dysfunction is present in an ART treated HIV population and if so to identify factors of importance. METHODS: HIV patients receiving ART for at least 12 months (n =  97) and an age-matched control group of healthy volunteers (n =  52) were included. All were non-diabetic and had never received medication for hypertension. Following a 10 min resting period a 15 min ECG recording was performed. Heart-rate variability (HRV) analysis was performed in accordance with current guidelines and data reported as mean [interquartile range]. RESULTS: Mean normal-to-normal (NN) and total HRV measured as standard deviation of normal-to-normal (SDNN) was lower in HIV patients compared to controls (905 vs. 982 ms; p< 0. 001 and 48 vs. 54 ms; p =  0. 028, respectively). No {{differences were found between the}} groups in parasympathetic activity measured as square root of the mean squared difference of successive NN-intervals (RMSSD) or the percent of differences between adjacent NN intervals greater than 50 ms (pNN 50). In the <b>HIV</b> <b>positives,</b> haemoglobin A 1 c correlated inversely with SDNN, RMSSD and pNN 50 (p< 0. 05). Total cholesterol and LDL-C correlated inversely with RMSSD and pNN 50 (p< 0. 05). Neither HIV duration, HIV-RNA, CD 4 cell count nor CD 4 nadir correlated with time or phase domain HRV variables. CONCLUSIONS: Moderate autonomic dysfunction is present in <b>HIV</b> <b>positives</b> patients even with suppressed viral load due to ART. The dysfunction is correlated with HbA 1 c and hypercholesterolemia but not to duration of HIV or whether the patients were receiving protease inhibitors as part of the ART regime...|$|R
