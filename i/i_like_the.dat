It never saw combat in World War <b>I,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> other units of the 87th Division, the brigade was used for labor duties and a pool of reinforcements. It received a campaign streamer for World War I without an inscription. After the war, it was demobilized on 23 May 1919 at Camp Dix, New Jersey.|$|E

5|$|My love is {{stronger}} than it's ever been, even though my love may seem to have diminished. I do not love less, even though I don't show it as much. Love becomes a commodity when it's spoken of too highly and too frequently. I used to sing my praises very frequently when our love was new, like the nightingale which sings {{in the summer and}} stops at summers end. It's not that the summer is less pleasant for the nightingale, it's simply that the songs of other birds fill the air, and when things become common, they become less dear. It's for this reason, <b>I,</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> nightingale, have stopped writing. I do not wish my poems to become boring.|$|E
25|$|There {{had been}} rumours after the Broadway meeting of January 1648, that Levellers were conspiring with Royalists to {{overthrow}} the new republic. During the Oxford mutiny this was confirmed when Parliament acquired {{a letter from a}} Royalist prisoner in the Tower of London to Lord Cottington, an advisor in exile with Charles II in France, which suggested that the Royalists should finance the Levellers, as a method by which Charles could be restored to the throne. Armed with this evidence parliament published a long declaration against the Levellers and passed a motion to try Lilburne for high treason, using a court similar to that which had tried Charles <b>I.</b> <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> trial of the King sentence would be passed by appointed commissioners (forty for Lilburne's trial), but unlike the King (who had no peers) a jury of 12 would decide on Lilburne's guilt or innocence. The trial took place in the London Guildhall. It started on 24 October 1649, and lasted two days. When the jury found him not guilty, the public shouted their approval so loudly and for so long that it was another half an hour before the proceedings could be formally closed.|$|E
25|$|William III {{regarded}} {{the war as}} an opportunity to reduce the power of France and protect the Dutch Republic, while providing conditions that would encourage trade and commerce. Although there remained territorial anomalies, Dutch war aims did not involve substantial alterations to the frontier; but William did aim to secure his new position in Britain. By seeking refuge in France and subsequently invading Ireland, James II had given William III the ideal instrument to convince the English parliament that entry into a major European war was unavoidable. With the support of Parliament, William III and Mary II declared war on 17 May 1689 (O.S.). This Anglo-Dutch alignment was the basis for the Grand Alliance, ratified on 20 December by William III representing England, Anthonie Heinsius and Treasurer Jacob Hop representing the Dutch Republic, and Königsegg and Stratman representing Emperor Leopold <b>I.</b> <b>Like</b> <b>the</b> Dutch the English were not preoccupied with territorial gains on the Continent, but were deeply concerned with limiting the power of France to defend against a Jacobite restoration (Louis XIV threatened to overthrow the Glorious Revolution and the precarious political settlement by supporting the old king over the new one). William III had secured his goal of mobilising Britain's resources for the anti-French coalition, but the Jacobite threat in Scotland and Ireland meant only a small English expeditionary force could be committed to assist the Dutch States Army in the coalition in the Spanish Netherlands for {{the first three years of}} the war.|$|E

He won the Shamus Award for Best P.I. Paperback Original in 1983 for The Cana Diversion and was awarded The Eye in 1984 for Lifetime Achievement, both by The Private Eye Writers of America. In 1991, he was presented Bouchercon's Lifetime Achievement Award.|$|R

500|$|In August 1996, Arsenal {{dismissed}} Bruce Rioch as club manager. Rioch's position {{had become}} untenable after {{a dispute with}} the board over transfers, and his working relationship with Dein worsened {{during the course of}} his tenure. Arsenal appointed Stewart Houston and later Pat Rice in temporary charge of the first team, while they searched for a full-time successor. Although Barcelona player and manager Johan Cruyff was favourite to take over, the board looked elsewhere, eventually backing Dein's proposal to hire Wenger. The appointment was delayed for several weeks as Wenger was under contract at Nagoya Grampus and the club wanted time to make a final decision. In the meantime the Arsenal board refused to confirm the identity of their next manager, but speculation grew that it would be Wenger once the club signed French midfielders Patrick Vieira and Rémi Garde. On 22 September 1996, Wenger was unveiled as Arsenal manager, after Nagoya Grampus granted him his release. He officially assumed the role on 1 October 1996. At his first press conference, he told reporters: [...] "The main reason for coming is that I love English football, the roots of the game are here. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> spirit round the game and at Arsenal <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> spirit of the club and its potential." ...|$|E

Clarkson explained, [...] "Hearing the Evanescence album, you can obviously tell that David and Ben have a real passion for music and that big kind of background.
