25|$|LDPE {{is defined}} by a density range of 0.910–0.940nbsp&g/cm3. LDPE has {{a high degree of}} short- and {{long-chain}} branching, which means that the chains do not pack into the crystal structure as well. It has, therefore, less strong intermolecular forces as the instantaneous-dipole induced-dipole attraction is less. This results in a lower tensile strength and increased ductility. LDPE is created by free-radical polymerization. The high degree of branching with long chains gives molten LDPE unique and desirable <b>flow</b> <b>properties.</b> LDPE is used for both rigid containers and plastic film applications such as plastic bags and film wrap. In 2013, the global LDPE market had a volume of almost US$33 billion.|$|E

If at every time t the normal derivative of u_t is a constant function on the boundary, we say that Ω has the constant <b>flow</b> <b>property.</b> This gives rise to an overdetermined parabolic problem, and our aim is to classify the manifolds having this property. In fact, if the metric is analytic, we prove that Ω has the constant <b>flow</b> <b>property</b> if and only if it is an isoparametric tube, that is, it is a solid tube of constant radius around a closed, smooth, minimal submanifold, with the additional property that all equidistants to the boundary (parallel hypersurfaces) are smooth and have constant mean curvature. Hence, the constant <b>flow</b> <b>property</b> can be viewed as an analytic counterpart to the isoparametric property. Finally, we relate the constant <b>flow</b> <b>property</b> with other overdetermined problems, in particular, the well-known Serrin problem on the mean-exit time function, and discuss a counterexample involving minimal free boundary immersions into Euclidean balls...|$|R
25|$|Fanno flow {{refers to}} {{adiabatic}} flow through a constant area duct where {{the effect of}} friction is considered. Compressibility effects often come into consideration, although the Fanno flow model certainly also applies to incompressible flow. For this model, the duct area remains constant, the flow {{is assumed to be}} steady and one-dimensional, and no mass is added within the duct. The Fanno flow model is considered an irreversible process due to viscous effects. The viscous friction causes the <b>flow</b> <b>properties</b> to change along the duct. The frictional effect is modeled as a shear stress at the wall acting on the fluid with uniform properties over any cross section of the duct.|$|E

The {{most common}} form uses methanol (converted to sodium methoxide) to produce methyl esters (commonly referred to as Fatty Acid Methyl Ester – FAME) {{as it is the}} cheapest alcohol available, though ethanol can be used to produce an ethyl ester (commonly referred to as Fatty Acid Ethyl Ester – FAEE) biodiesel and higher alcohols such as isopropanol and butanol have also been used. Using alcohols of higher molecular weights improves the cold <b>flow</b> <b>properties</b> of the resulting ester, at the cost of a less efficient transesterification reaction. A lipid transesterification production process is used to convert the base oil to the desired esters. Any free fatty acids (FFAs) in the base oil are either converted to soap and removed from the process, or they are esterified (yielding more biodiesel) using an acidic catalyst. After this processing, unlike straight vegetable oil, biodiesel has combustion properties very similar to those of petroleum diesel, and can replace it in most current uses.|$|E
25|$|The {{red blood}} cells of mammals are {{typically}} shaped as biconcave disks: flattened and depressed in the center, with a dumbbell-shaped cross section, and a torus-shaped rim {{on the edge of}} the disk. This distinctive biconcave shape optimises the <b>flow</b> <b>properties</b> of blood in the large vessels, such as maximization of laminar flow and minimization of platelet scatter, which suppresses their atherogenic activity in those large vessels. However, there are some exceptions concerning shape in the artiodactyl order (even-toed ungulates including cattle, deer, and their relatives), which displays a wide variety of bizarre red blood cell morphologies: small and highly ovaloid cells in llamas and camels (family Camelidae), tiny spherical cells in mouse deer (family Tragulidae), and cells which assume fusiform, lanceolate, crescentic, and irregularly polygonal and other angular forms in red deer and wapiti (family Cervidae). Members of this order have clearly evolved a mode of red blood cell development substantially different from the mammalian norm. Overall, mammalian {{red blood cells}} are remarkably flexible and deformable so as to squeeze through tiny capillaries, as well as to maximize their apposing surface by assuming a cigar shape, where they efficiently release their oxygen load.|$|E

25|$|As {{aircraft}} {{began to}} travel faster, aerodynamicists {{realized that the}} density of air began to change as it {{came into contact with}} an object, leading to a division of fluid flow into the incompressible and compressible regimes. In compressible aerodynamics, density and pressure both change, which is the basis for calculating the speed of sound. Newton was the first to develop a mathematical model for calculating the speed of sound, but it was not correct until Pierre-Simon Laplace accounted for the molecular behavior of gases and introduced the heat capacity ratio. The ratio of the flow speed to the speed of sound was named the Mach number after Ernst Mach, {{who was one of the}} first to investigate the properties of supersonic flow which included Schlieren photography techniques to visualize the changes in density.

The proof of this result makes use of a special decomposition of a doubly stochastic matrix, as given by Birkhoff-von Neumann theorem.

So, with all of these terms now defined, one can look at the specific properties that mayonnaise possesses. Mayonnaise has a high shear stress with a typical yield stress around 100 Pascals). For reference, ketchup has a yield stress of about 15 Pascals. With such a high yield stress, mayonnaise is able to resist low forces and even return to its original conformation.
