5|$|The decathlon was a {{relatively}} new event in modern athletics, although it {{had been part of}} American track meets since the 1880s and a version had been featured on the program of the 1904 St.Louis Olympics. The events of the new decathlon differed slightly from the American version. Both seemed appropriate for Thorpe, who was so versatile that he served as Carlisle's one-man team in several track meets. According to his obituary in The New York Times, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>run</b> the 100-yard dash in 10seconds flat; the 220 in 21.8seconds; the 440 in 51.8seconds; the 880 in 1:57, the mile in 4:35; the 120-yard high hurdles in 15seconds; and the 220-yard low hurdles in 24seconds. He could long jump 23ft 6in and high-jump 6ft 5in. He could pole vault 11feet; put the shot 47ft 9in; throw the javelin 163feet; and throw the discus 136feet.|$|E
5|$|Bolt {{claimed his}} first major world medal two months later at the IAAF World Athletics Final in Stuttgart, Germany. He passed the {{finishing}} post {{with a time of}} 20.10 s, gaining a bronze medal in the process. The IAAF World Cup in Athens, Greece, yielded Bolt's first senior international silver medal. Wallace Spearmon from the United States won gold with a championship record time of 19.87 s, beating Bolt's respectable time of 19.96 s. Further 200 m honours on both the regional and international stages awaited Bolt in 2007. He yearned to run in the 100 metres but Mills was skeptical, believing that Bolt was better suited for middle distances. The coach cited the runner's difficulty in smoothly starting out of the blocks, and poor habits such as looking back at opponents in sprints. Mills told Bolt that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>run</b> the shorter distance if he broke the 200 m national record. In the Jamaican Championships, he ran 19.75 s in the 200 m, breaking the 36-year-old Jamaican record held by Don Quarrie by 0.11 s.|$|E
25|$|Cean Stevens, the Libertarian party primary winner, {{stepped aside}} to allow Miller {{to receive the}} Libertarian nomination, in order that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>run</b> in the crowded 2016 Senate election. He placed second in the general election, {{receiving}} just under 30% of the vote.|$|E
60|$|Thus {{it came to}} him {{merely to}} run away was folly, because <b>he</b> <b>could</b> never <b>run</b> away from himself.|$|R
60|$|He pointed with 'is finger, and as {{they all}} looked down he jumped up out o' that chair and set off {{on the road to}} Wickham as 'ard as <b>'e</b> <b>could</b> <b>run.</b> It was so sudden that nobody knew wot 'ad 'appened for a moment, and then George Kettle, wot 'ad been looking with the rest, turned round and pulled the trigger.|$|R

25|$|Incumbent Democratic Congressman Ben Cardin {{declined}} {{to seek an}} eleventh term so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>run</b> for Senate. John Sarbanes, the son of retiring Senator Paul Sarbanes and an attorney, won a crowded Democratic primary and became the Democratic nominee. Annapolis marketing executive John White was the Republican nominee, and, true to the liberal nature of this district based in the Baltimore metropolitan area, Sarbanes beat White.|$|E
25|$|When long-time congressman Joe H. Eagle did {{not seek}} reelection in 1936, so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>run</b> for the United States Senate, Thomas sought and won the Democratic nomination, which was {{tantamount}} to election. In that primary, Thomas beat Houston Mayor Oscar F. Holcombe in what was something of an upset. The Eighth District of Texas at that time comprised all of Harris County, which includes the state's largest city, Houston.|$|E
25|$|Grau's {{presidency}} {{was followed by}} that of Carlos Prío Socarrás, also elected democratically, but whose government was tainted by increasing corruption and violent incidents among political factions. Around the same time, Fidel Castro became a public figure at the University of Havana. Eduardo Chibás {{the leader of the}} Partido Ortodoxo (Orthodox Party), a liberal democratic group was widely expected to win in 1952 on an anticorruption platform. However, Chibás committed suicide before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>run</b> for the presidency, and the opposition was left without a unifying leader.|$|E

25|$|One of Muawiyah's most {{controversial}} and enduring legacies was {{his decision to}} designate his son Yazid as his successor. Yazid was experienced militarily and had taken part in expeditions and the siege of Constantinople, but he was politically inexperienced. Marwan also wanted Yazid to be the caliph so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>run</b> things behind the scenes, as he would become the {{senior member of the}} Umayyad clan after Muawiyah's death. Mohammad, Abu Bakr and Umar also mistrusted Marwan, and he had lived in Taif during their rule, where he became friends with AlHajjaj.|$|E
25|$|Quli Khan {{continued}} his policy of sending {{part of the}} revenue collected to the Mughal Empire. He did so even when the empire was in decline with the emperor vesting no power, as the power became concentrated {{in the hands of}} kingmakers. He justified his action by saying that {{it would be impossible to}} run the Mughal Empire without the revenue he sent. Historian Chowdhury says that his real reason was to show his loyalty to the Mughal Emperor so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>run</b> the state according to his own wishes.|$|E
25|$|Besides his cricketing ability, Jessop was an {{allround}} {{athlete of}} note. He got his Blue as a hockey goalkeeper, but fell ill {{and could not}} play in the University match. He came near getting an Association football Blue and played for The Casuals as half-back or goalkeeper. He also appeared as a wing-threequarter for Gloucester R.F.C. He would have played billiards for Cambridge against Oxford, but was gated and could not take part. In one week he made two breaks of over 150. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>run</b> the 100 yards in 10.2 seconds and frequently entered for sports meetings. A scratch golfer, he {{took part in the}} Amateur Championship in 1914, was Secretary of the Cricketers' Golfing Society and for some years Secretary of the Edgware Club (cricinfo.com).|$|E
60|$|With {{the bills}} in his hand, Ralph {{got out of}} the way of the trucks and wagons as soon as <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> <b>He</b> <b>ran</b> to the sidewalk, and counted the money. There were eleven dollars. In his haste, Jackson Walters had thrown him five dollars more than the amount {{originally}} taken.|$|R

25|$|Nationwide, Ivo Josipović {{obtained}} 32% and Milan Bandić 14%, {{meaning the}} two of them combined achieved less support than Stjepan Mesić did in 2005 in the first round only. The fact that there were only three actual left-leaning candidates meant the left was relatively united under Josipović, while the votes of the right were spread out on several prominent candidates, including Bandić, {{which was one of the}} reasons why no right wing candidate managed to qualify for a run-off. As such, this election became historic as a run-off would feature two candidates once in the same party, Josipović, who rejoined SDP a year before the election, and Bandić, who left SDP a month before the election so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>run</b> as an independent.|$|E
25|$|Once he {{is legally}} elected President of the Confederacy, Featherston slowly and quietly twists the Confederate Constitution into giving him more power. He {{maneuvers}} the Supreme Court into striking {{itself out of}} existence, provokes the black minority toward rebellion with race riots, creates farm machinery to root {{them out of their}} livelihoods so he could incarcerate them in concentration camps, and repeals the single term limit so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>run</b> multiple times. In the meantime, the black rebellions give the CSA a plausible excuse to reinstitute conscription and arm itself. He manipulates Socialist US President Al Smith into allowing the states of Kentucky, Houston, and Sequoyah (all formerly part of the Confederacy) to hold plebiscites to determine their futures. Kentucky and Houston vote to rejoin the Confederacy with Houston also rejoining Texas, while Sequoyah, which had been saturated with settlers {{from other parts of the}} north, voted to remain part of the US.|$|E
25|$|Sanader {{nominated}} Andrija Hebrang as the party's {{candidate for}} president, {{a decision that}} was backed by {{the remainder of the}} party's presidency after a while, but not before widespread rumours started about the HDZ member Nadan Vidošević, a prominent businessman, being the presidency's favorite candidate. Vidošević however rejected these claims. Hebrang also hesitated before accepting the party nomination, explaining it with health reasons. Vidošević formally announced his bid as an independent candidate on September 2, and was expelled from his party soon after that. Also, Ivo Sanader was not {{the only member of the}} cabinet to resign as Minister of Education Dragan Primorac also announced his retirement on the very same day as the prime minister. There was much speculation that Primorac resigned as he was not his party's candidate for president and that he resigned so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>run</b> as an independent. The speculation proved to be true and Primorac announced his candidacy on 9 November 2009. He was then also ejected from HDZ membership.|$|E
50|$|He {{was also}} an amateur athlete and in 1898 won the {{national}} title for high jump and also shot put. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> also <b>run</b> the 100 metres in just over 10 seconds.|$|R
60|$|Prescott {{understood}} the maneuver. By driving east the fugitive had lost ground, and if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> push on fast enough, Prescott might reach a position from which <b>he</b> <b>could</b> either <b>run</b> him down or turn {{him back into}} the hands of the trooper.|$|R

25|$|Under the empire, the {{citizens}} {{were divided into}} three classes, and for members of each class, a distinct career path was available (known as the cursus honorum). The traditional magistracies were only available to citizens of the senatorial class. The magistracies that survived {{the fall of the}} republic were (by their order of rank per the cursus honorum) the Consulship, Praetorship, Plebeian Tribunate, Aedileship, Quaestorship, and Military Tribunate. If an individual was not of the senatorial class, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>run</b> for one of these offices if he was allowed to run by the emperor, or otherwise, he could be appointed to one of these offices by the emperor. During the transition from republic to empire, no office lost more power or prestige than the Consulship, which was due, in part, {{to the fact that the}} substantive powers of republican Consuls were all transferred to the emperor. Imperial Consuls could preside over the senate, could act as judges in certain criminal trials, and had control over public games and shows. The Praetors also lost a great deal of power, and ultimately had little authority outside of the city. The chief Praetor in Rome, the Urban Praetor, outranked all other Praetors, and for a brief time, they were given power over the treasury. Under the empire, the Plebeian Tribunes remained sacrosanct, and, in theory at least, retained the power to summon, or to veto, the senate and the assemblies. Augustus divided the college of Quaestors into two divisions, and assigned one division the task of serving in the senatorial provinces, and the other the task of managing civil administration in Rome. Under Augustus, the Aediles lost control over the grain supply to a board of commissioners. It wasn't until after they lost the power to maintain order in the city, however, that they truly became powerless, and the office disappeared entirely during the 3rd century.|$|E
500|$|After the race, Secretariat {{was brought}} to Aqueduct Racetrack where he was paraded with Turcotte dressed in the Meadow silks before a crowd of 32,990 in his final public appearance. [...] "It's a sad day, and yet it's a great day", said Laurin. [...] "I {{certainly}} wish <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>run</b> as a 4-year-old. He's a great horse and he loves to run." ...|$|E
500|$|Heath, who had {{acquired}} the nickname [...] "Lord Jeff", {{was called a}} [...] "problem child" [...] by Indian player-manager Lou Boudreau. Peckinpaugh once said that Heath [...] "could {{have been one of}} the greatest players. He had the ability to do about anything. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>run,</b> he could throw, and he could hit. But he just had no hustle, no nothing. If a ball went by him, he just might walk after it." [...] In December 1945 the Indians traded Heath to the Washington Senators where he started in right field.|$|E
25|$|Bloomberg was term-limited; {{after his}} third term, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>run</b> again in 2013. Bill de Blasio won the {{subsequent}} mayoral election, and was sworn into the mayor's office on January 1, 2014, by former President Bill Clinton.|$|R
6000|$|When Blake {{mentioned}} the loan Frank got up, and {{stood with his}} back to the fire; then bit his lips, and walked twice up and down the room, with his hands in his pockets, and then he paused, looked out of the window, and attempted to whistle: then he threw himself into an armchair, poked out both his legs as far as <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> <b>ran</b> his fingers through his hair, and set to work hard to make up his mind. But it was no good; in about five minutes <b>he</b> found <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not do it; so he took out his purse, and, extracting half-a-crown, threw it up to the ceiling, saying, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I imagine I {{will get}} them before long, {{although}} it doesn't seem to have struck him that my clothes are damp. It's rather significant that he went on when <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have <b>run</b> across the field and caught us up. Have you known him long?" ...|$|R
500|$|In 1968, Motley {{became the}} second black player voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, located in his {{hometown}} of Canton. Having played successfully as a fullback and pass blocker on offense and as a linebacker on defense, he is seen {{as one of the best}} all-around players in football history. Blanton Collier, an assistant who took over as the team's head coach after Paul Brown's firing in 1963, said Motley [...] "had no equal as a blocker. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>run</b> with anybody for 30 yards or so. And this man was a great, great linebacker." ...|$|E
500|$|Paynter's next {{race was}} the Grade I Awesome Again Stakes at Santa Anita on September 28. He started from the seven post {{with his former}} rider, Martin Garcia up. After running {{in the middle of}} the pack and going five horses wide coming into the stretch, he {{finished}} second to Mucho Macho Man. His placing was viewed by sportswriters as proof that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>run</b> against top competitors. [...] Baffert said Paynter was still [...] "a bit rusty," [...] but the trainer was happy with Paynter's race. He was entered in the Breeders' Cup Classic, on November 2. [...] Before the race, he had a very strong workout and Baffert said that Paynter was [...] "a monster" [...] and [...] "back to top form", and Ahmed Zayat stated, [...] "Paynter is a horse like no other ... The fact that he's even competing in the Breeders' Cup is miraculous." [...] Though he finished 7th out of 11 horses, with Mucho Macho Man winning again, Paynter finished ahead of a fellow Awesome Again son, the stakes-winning favorite Game On Dude.|$|E
500|$|When {{running along}} Blackpool's beach, at 7 am, {{no matter the}} weather, Matthews wore shoes that {{contained}} lead, {{so that when he}} changed into his football boots, his feet felt light, giving himself the impression that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>run</b> faster. Having trained to a level of fitness few other players would reach, by the mid-1950s he was able to cut back on his intense training as his level of fitness was by then ingrained in his body. He never smoked; instead, he was very conscious of every item of food and drink he consumed, and he maintained a rigid daily training regime from childhood up until his old age. In an interview with the FA he said, [...] "I had some very good advice and started to eat more salads and fruit, and every Monday I had no food. Just one day, on a Monday, but I felt better." [...] The only time he knowingly consumed alcohol was when drinking champagne out of the FA Cup in 1953.|$|E
