5000|$|In {{the same}} interview, bassist Sam Farrar {{described}} the new logo. Which is a <b>circular</b> <b>graphic</b> of piano keys {{that seem to}} morph into a shirt sleeve with a hand emerging from the cuff. He said, [...] "The idea is that we're going to {{sell a lot of}} these sweatshirts and all the kids will show up in them so the entire audience looks just like us." [...] Alex followed this up by saying that [...] "The [...] "Leader" [...] is the hand. He is the hand that plays the notes we sing to. It's in the beginning stages still; we're just chipping away at the stone." ...|$|R

It supersedes the set of programs previously issued as the circstat package, except for users of earlier versions. The help for circular is a master help file with links to all individual help files. It includes the fourier package, previously a standalone item. <b>circular,</b> directions, <b>graphics,</b> orientations...|$|R
50|$|A {{pie chart}} (or a circle chart) is a <b>circular</b> {{statistical}} <b>graphic</b> which {{is divided into}} slices to illustrate numerical proportion. In a pie chart, the arc length of each slice (and consequently its central angle and area), {{is proportional to the}} quantity it represents. While it is named for its resemblance to a pie which has been sliced, there are variations on the way it can be presented. The earliest known pie chart is generally credited to William Playfair's Statistical Breviary of 1801.|$|R
5000|$|In Computer <b>Graphics,</b> <b>circular</b> fisheye {{images can}} be used to create {{environment}} maps from the physical world. One complete 180-degree wide angle fisheye image will fit to half of cubic mapping space using the proper algorithm. Environment maps {{can be used to}} render 3D objects and virtual panoramic scenes.|$|R
40|$|DNA Strider {{is a new}} {{integrated}} DNA and Protein {{sequence analysis}} program written with the C language for the Macintosh Plus, SE and II computers. It has been designed as an easy to learn and use program {{as well as a}} fast and efficient tool for the day-to-day sequence analysis work. The program consists of a multi-window sequence editor and of various DNA and Protein analysis functions. The editor may use 4 different types of sequences (DNA, degenerate DNA, RNA and one-letter coded protein) and can handle simultaneously 6 sequences of any type up to 32. 5 kB each. Negative numbering of the bases is allowed for DNA sequences. All classical restriction and translation analysis functions are present and can be performed in any order on any open sequence or part of a sequence. The main feature of the program is that the same analysis function can be repeated several times on different sequences, thus generating multiple windows on the screen. Many graphic capabilities have been incorporated such as graphic restriction map, hydrophobicity profile and the CAI plot- codon adaptation index according to Sharp and Li. The restriction sites search uses a newly designed fast hexamer look-ahead algorithm. Typical runtime for the search of all sites with a library of 130 restriction endonucleases is 1 second per 10, 000 bases. The <b>circular</b> <b>graphic</b> restriction map of the pBR 322 plasmid can be therefore computed from its sequence and displayed on the Macintosh Plus screen within 2 seconds and its multiline restriction map obtained in a scrolling window within 5 seconds...|$|R
40|$|Latino {{populations are}} on the increase. Demographic {{projections}} indicate that because of high fertility rates and continuous immigration patterns, Latino groups {{will be the largest}} minority group in the United States within seven years. Mexican American women represent a sub-group of adult Latinas. Stereotypes of Mexican American women and the lack of their representation in research literature contributes to misrepresentations of Mexican American culture and their invisibility. The omission of Mexican American women voices and life histories to the research literature continues to oppress this group. Potentially their attitudes toward positive self concept and perceptions of success could weaken. ^ In this qualitative research study, Mexican American women were interviewed. Their life histories were examined utilizing an ethnographic and hermeneutical phenomenological approach. <b>Circular</b> <b>graphic</b> representations of prominent thematic interpretations were supported by using a systems theory approach. This approach examined how various systems such as, acculturation patterns, socialization in the family of origin and empowerment perspectives are integrated in Mexican American women 2 Ì† 7 s lives. Several dominant themes were generated and analyzed. These themes included: Relationships, Education, Philosophy Toward Education, Career, Confidence, and Artistic. Although some of these Latinas were unfamiliar with each other, similar patterns emerged from these analyses of themes. ^ The findings are discussed in terms of their implication for working with Latina women, specifically, Mexican American women. This research should assist educators and helping professionals understand Mexican American women more intimately, and discover how these women attach meaning to their lives. Suggestions for future research are also presented. ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1965, in {{attempt to}} update its image, MGM {{recruited}} Lippincott {{to create a more}} contemporary logo. The result, a <b>circular</b> still <b>graphic</b> image of a lion known as [...] "The Stylized Lion", appeared at the front of three films in the 1960s: Grand Prix (1966), 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), and The Subject Was Roses (1968). Afterwards, Leo was reinstated for the opening logo. The Stylized Lion, however, was retained by the studio as its print logo, used by the MGM Records division studio advertising, in addition to being shown at the end of credit rolls following most MGM movie releases of this period, continuing until 1982. It was later used by the MGM Grand casinos. (A refined version of it is used as the logo for their parent company, MGM Resorts International.) ...|$|R
25|$|Since {{the atomic}} radii (e.g. in Fig. 4) are only {{slightly}} less than the distance between bonded atoms, the iconic spheres intersect, and in the CPK models, this was achieved by planar truncations along the bonding directions, the section being <b>circular.</b> When raster <b>graphics</b> became affordable, {{one of the common}} approaches was to replicate CPK models in silico. It is relatively straightforward to calculate the circles of intersection, but more complex to represent a model with hidden surface removal. A useful side product is that a conventional value for the molecular volume can be calculated.|$|R
40|$|The work {{reported}} in this thesis {{is concerned with the}} improvement and expansion of the assistance given to the designer by the computer in the design of cold formed sections. The main contributions have been in four areas, which have consequently led to the fifth, the development of a methodology to optimise designs. This methodology can be considered an `Expert Design System' for cold formed sections. A different method of determining section properties of profiles was introduced, using the properties of line and <b>circular</b> elements. <b>Graphics</b> were introduced to show the outline of the profile on screen. The analysis of beam loading has been expanded to beam loading conditions where the number of supports, point loads, and uniform distributive loads can be specified by the designer. The profile can then be checked for suitability for the specified type of loading. Artificial Intelligence concepts have been introduced to give the designer decision support from the computer, in combination with the computer aided design facilities. The more complex decision support was adopted through the use of production rules. All the support was based on the British standards. A method has been introduced, by which the appropriate use of stiffeners can be determined and consequently designed by the designer. Finally, the methodology by which the designer is given assistance from the computer, without constraining the designer, was developed. This methodology gives advice to the designer on possible methods of improving the design, but allows the designer to reject that option, and analyse the profile accordingly. The methodology enables optimisation to be achieved by the designer, designing variety of profiles for a particular loading, and determining which one is best suited...|$|R
