5|$|On {{the night}} of 7/8 April, Petrović ordered Trifunović to begin to withdraw, first to a line through the Dravinja river, Zidani Most bridge and the right bank of the Krka river.

This ended the {{successful}} defence of the 38th Infantry Division Dravska along the line of the Drava, and meant their withdrawal from Maribor. <b>Disregarding</b> orders from above, Palten exploited their withdrawal by leading his kampfgruppe south towards the town, and crossing the Pesnica river in inflatable boats, leaving his unit vehicles behind. In the evening, Palten and his force entered Maribor unopposed, taking 100 prisoners. For <b>disregarding</b> orders, Palten and his kampfgruppe were ordered to return to Spielfeld, and {{spent the rest of the}} invasion guarding the border.

Part I sets out the legal framework for arbitration in the United States and the statutory and extrastatutory grounds for vacatur of awards. It discusses the development and application {{of the doctrine of}} manifest <b>disregard</b> of the law in U. S. common law and the tension this has created with the FAA. Part II analyzes the Hall Street decision and the subsequent developing circuit split, including the case 2 ̆ 7 s impact on viability of manifest <b>disregard.</b> It also discusses different approaches to reconciling manifest <b>disregard</b> with the FAA both through the judiciary and legislature. Finally Part III argues that Hall Street has not eliminated manifest <b>disregard</b> and that the Second and Ninth Circuits 2 ̆ 7 approach to reading the doctrine into the FAA is the best method of resolving the tension between the FAA and the doctrine. By adopting this approach, the Supreme Court would clarify its stance on the viability of manifest <b>disregard</b> and take a significant step in addressing the underlying tension between the FAA and the manifest <b>disregard</b> doctrine. This Note further argues that, on policy grounds-especially with regard to promoting international arbitration in the United States and as consistent with legislative intent-manifest <b>disregard</b> as a doctrine should only survive {{as a part of the}} FAA...|$|R

Study objectives were to evaluate cortical change after modified constraint therapy and explore {{a novel approach}} to quantify developmental <b>disregard.</b> Five participants underwent modified constraint therapy.

Four participants showed clinical improvement posttreatment. Functional MRI laterality indices were vari-able pretreatment and exclusively contralateral among parti-cipants posttreatment. The <b>disregard</b> index range was – 12. 9 to 62. 6 among participants. <b>Disregard</b> indices were corre-lated with change scores after treatment on the Pediatric Motor Activity Log amount of use domain (r. 93, P. 02), Assisting Hand Assessment (r. 93, P. 02), and grip strength (r. 92, P. 03).
