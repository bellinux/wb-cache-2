500|$|An {{armistice}} {{was signed}} on 26 January 1871, but {{the departure of}} the Prussian troops from Paris in March presaged a period of confusion and civil disturbance. Following an uprising, the city's municipal authority was taken over by dissidents who established the Paris Commune. Bizet decided that he was no longer safe in the city, and he and Geneviève escaped to Compiègne. Later, they moved to Le Vésinet where they sat out the two months of the Commune, within <b>hearing</b> <b>distance</b> of the gunfire that resounded as government troops gradually crushed the uprising: [...] "The cannons are rumbling with unbelievable violence", Bizet wrote to his mother-in-law on 12 May.|$|E
2500|$|An {{ensemble}} of nipa {{houses in the}} other barrios of the hacienda like Malinta, Nancaan, Salacay, Paliparan, Malagasang and Salitran were grouped and migrated into a reduccion (reduction) in Tampus in 1866. Reduccion [...] originally meant the religious and civic aspects of [...] missionary activities. Later it came to mean the process of resettling and unifying a community, thereby creating a newly organized town. For the Spanish missionaries and friars, this process was [...] advantageous not only for evangelization but also for bringing people under the Spanish rule. A new town called [...] Tampus was formed. From that time on, the people of Tampus built their houses within the <b>hearing</b> <b>distance</b> of the church bells – [...] "bajo las toques de campana". The new town could be reached through a good network of roads and bridges built by the best architects and engineers of the Recollect Order.|$|E
2500|$|Babo reminds Cereno that it’s {{time for}} his shave. [...] "Most negroes are natural valets and hairdressers; taking to the comb and brush congenially as to the castinets, and flourishing them {{apparently}} with equal satisfaction", springing from [...] "the docility arising from the unaspiring contentment of a limited mind". Babo suggests that Delano joins them in the cuddy to continue the conversation with Cereno, and Delano witnesses the shaving with an appreciative eye for Babo’s graceful skill as a barber and a hairdresser. Babo first searches [...] "for the sharpest" [...] razor, and Cereno [...] "nervously shuddered" [...] at the [...] "sight of gleaming steel". Delano himself, for a brief moment, cannot resist [...] "the vagary, that in the black he saw a headsman, and in the white, {{a man at the}} block." [...] Cereno is nervously shaking, and just when Delano curiously asks him how he could have spent over two months crossing a distance Delano himself would have sailed within a few days, then, whether caused by a sudden wave on the sea, or [...] "a momentary unsteadiness of the servant’s hand; however it was, just then the razor drew blood", and immediately [...] "the black barber drew back his steel". Delano precedes the two out of the cuddy and walks to the mainmast, where Babo joins him, complaining that Cereno cut his cheek in reproach for his carelessness, while Cereno’s own shaking caused the cut. Delano feels that slavery fosters ugly passions, and invites Cereno for coffee aboard the Bachelor’s Delight, which Cereno declines, offending Delano, who is also increasingly irritated by the lack of opportunity to have a private conversation without Babo within <b>hearing</b> <b>distance.</b>|$|E

40|$|Aims: This study {{investigated}} the link between attachment anxiety/avoidance, interpersonal aspects of the voice relationship, and distress whilst considering the impact of beliefs about voices and paranoia. Method: A cross sectional correlational method was employed and participants were recruited mainly via online forums for people who hear voices. 44 participants who heard voices completed a number of self-report measures tapping attachment, interpersonal processes in the voice relationship, beliefs about voices, paranoia, distress and depression. Results: As predicted, associations were found between attachment avoidance and voice intrusiveness, <b>hearer</b> <b>distance</b> and distress. Associations were also found between attachment anxiety and voice intrusiveness, hearer dependence and distress. A series of simple mediation analyses were conducted which suggest {{that the relationship between}} attachment and voice related distress may be mediated by interpersonal dynamics in the voice – hearer relationship, beliefs about voices and paranoia. Conclusions: Results are considered within existing theory whilst acknowledging the limitations of the study. Clinical implications are considered and it is concluded that this preliminary investigation would suggest that attachment is important to consider in therapy with people who hear voices...|$|R
40|$|The hearing {{range of}} the tettigoniid Phaneropterafalcata for the {{echolocation}} calls of freely flying mouseeared bats (Myotis myotis) was determined in the field. The hearing of the insect was monitored using hook electrode recordings from an auditory interneuron, which is as sensitive as the hearing organ for frequencies above 16 kHz. The flight path of the bat relative to the insect's position was tracked by recording the echolocation calls with two microphone arrays, and calculating the bat's position from the arrival time differences of the calls at each microphone. The <b>hearing</b> <b>distances</b> ranged from 13 to 30 m. The large variability appeared both between different insects and between different bat approaches to an individual insect. The escape time of the bushcricket, calculated from the detection distance of the insect and the instantaneous flight speed of the bat, ranged from 1. 5 to more than 4 s. The hearing ranges of bushcrickets suggest that the insect hears the approaching bat long before the bat can detect an echo from the flying insect...|$|R

There is a contrast between an enclosed location and a nonenclosed location, {{resulting in the}} use of two different morphemes, 'ka'pɪgn' and 'ʔep' respectively.

5000|$|The {{harmonic}} {{series is}} an arithmetic series (1×f, 2×f, 3×f, 4×f, 5×f, ...). In terms of frequency (measured in cycles per second, or hertz (Hz) where f {{is the fundamental}} frequency), the difference between consecutive harmonics is therefore constant and equal to the fundamental. But because human ears respond to sound nonlinearly, higher harmonics are perceived as [...] "closer together" [...] than lower ones. On the other hand, the octave series is a geometric progression (2×f, 4×f, 8×f, 16×f, ...), and people <b>hear</b> these <b>distances</b> as [...] "the same" [...] {{in the sense of}} musical interval. In terms of what one hears, each octave in the harmonic series is divided into increasingly [...] "smaller" [...] and more numerous intervals.|$|R

The impact which emerge in the proccess of operati ng electric generatorwith diesel power (PLTD) is the noise which came from the diesel machi ne. Objective: This research was aimed to know the correlation between theability to <b>hear</b> and the <b>distance</b> of people houses around PLTD indownstrream Siantan. Methodes: This research was an analytic study with cross-sectional approach. 92 subjects were chosen as sample by using cluster random sampling technique. Subjects were examined by usi ng tuning fork examination (ri nne,weber, and schwabach test) and were categori zed into normal group and hindrance group. According to the distance of people houses from PLTD indownstream Siantan, subjects were categorized into < 100 meters and? 100 meters. The data were analyzed by using Statistical Product and ServiceSolution 17. 00 programme. Results: There was correlation that statistically significant between the abilityto <b>hear</b> and the <b>distance</b> of people houses around PLTD in downstream Siantan (P< 0, 027). The relati ve risk (prevalens ratio [RP] and the reliableinterval 95 % [IK]) of hearing impairments on respondents who are at a radius of less than 100 meters was (RP 1, 86; IK 1, 072, 37). Conclusion: There was corelation that statistically significant between the ability to <b>hear</b> and the <b>distance</b> of people houses around PLTD (electricgenerator with diesel power) in downstream Siantan. The house distance is the risk factor of hi ndrancing the ability to hear. In this case, subjects whosestated less than 100 meters from the PLTD have 1, 9 times higher risk thansubjects whose stated more than equal to 100 meters from PLTD (electric generator with diesel power) in downstream Siantan...|$|R
