500|$|Joyce's {{versions}} of events recorded in his published diaries {{have been described}} as unreliable and sometimes as outright invention—a [...] "self-aggrandizing epic". [...] Specific examples of this [...] "fabulism" [...] include his self-designation as [...] "Captain" [...] after the Ross Sea expedition; [...] his invented claim to have seen Scott's death tent on the Barrier; [...] the misrepresentation of his instructions from Shackleton regarding his sledging role, and his assertion of independence in the field; his claim to have been offered a place on the transcontinental party when Shackleton had made it clear he did not want him there; [...] and his habit, late in life, of writing anonymously to the press praising [...] "the famous Polar Explorer Ernest Mills Joyce". This self-promotion neither surprised nor upset his former comrades. [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have expected", said Richards. [...] "He was bombastic [...] but true-hearted and a staunch friend". Alexander Stevens, the party's chief scientist, concurred. They knew that Joyce, for all his swaggering style, had the will and determination to [...] "drag men back from certain death". Lord Shackleton, the explorer's son, named Joyce (with Mackintosh and Richards) as [...] "one of those who emerge from the (Ross Sea party) story as heroes".|$|E

2500|$|In January 2008, Kaz Hirai, CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment, {{suggested}} that the console may start making a profit by early 2009, stating that, [...] "the next fiscal year starts in April {{and if we can}} try to achieve that in the next fiscal year that would be a great thing" [...] and that [...] " [...] is not a definite commitment, but that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> like to try to shoot for". However, market analysts Nikko Citigroup have predicted that PlayStation 3 could be profitable by August 2008. In a July 2008 interview, Hirai stated that his objective is for PlayStation 3 to sell 150 million units by its ninth year, surpassing PlayStation 2's sales of 140 million in its nine years on the market. In January 2009 Sony announced that their gaming division was profitable in Q3 2008.|$|E

5000|$|The sixth season {{received}} generally positive reviews. Justin Fowler of Later Reviews {{gave the}} season a positive review, {{saying that the}} season was [...] "a pretty good season of television" [...] and better than the [...] "poor" [...] fifth season. He also said that [...] "Seventeen out of the 24 episodes <b>are</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> consider good".|$|R
2500|$|With age, a {{deepening}} personally spirtuality led to several elucidations and clarifications, as he untangled language problems in religion, attacking, for example, {{the temptation to}} think of God's existence {{as a matter of}} scientific evidence. In 1947, finding it more difficult to work, he wrote, [...] "I have had a letter from an old friend in Austria, a priest. In it he says that he hopes my work will go well, if it should be God's will. Now that is all I want: if it should be God's will." [...] In Wittgenstein's Culture and Value, it is found, [...] "Is what I am doing [...] really worth the effort? Yes, but only if a light shines on it from above." [...] His close friend Norman Malcolm would write, [...] "Wittgenstein’s mature life was strongly marked by religious thought and feeling. I am inclined to think that he was more deeply religious than are many people who correctly regard themselves as religious believers." [...] At last, Wittgenstein writes, [...] "Bach wrote on the title page of his Orgelbuechlein, ‘To the glory of the most high God, and that my neighbour may be benefited thereby.’ [...] That <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have liked to say about my work." ...|$|E

60|$|The critic {{need not}} be impolite even to the {{youngest}} and weakest author. A little courtesy, or a good deal, a constant perception {{of the fact that}} a book is not a misdemeanor, a decent self-respect that must forbid the civilized man the savage pleasure of wounding, <b>are</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> ask for our criticism, as something which will add sensibly to its present lustre.|$|R
5000|$|BB {{has been}} {{described}} as a disciplined, almost obsessed, worker by Nabaneeta Dev Sen. After meeting Buddhadeva Bose, Clinton B. Seely remarked that Buddhadeva was a very intense person. He spoke quickly, with emotion. He laughed wonderfully. He was interested in everything... He <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> come to refer to as [...] "jyanto," [...] "alive," [...] "vibrant," [...] "energetic." [...] Conversations were often at fever pitch. He was bubbling over with things to say.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} and welcome developments in government over the last 50 years or so has <b>been</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> call the “professionalization of economic policy. ” If I had to date the beginning of this development <b>I</b> <b>would</b> choose 1961, when the Kennedy administration was formed.

Bush: “Paul {{was that}} rarest of men, who possess {{not only the}} drive, the {{integrity}} and the vision to succeed spectacularly in business, but also a tremendous capacity for friendship. He <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> call a true point of light, helping and usually leading many worthwhile causes. So, yes, I liked and I respected this good man immensely. At age 89 and a half, I recognize more than ever the importance and the blessings of friendship.” ...|$|R

60|$|I {{had several}} visits of the like kind from him, {{but he never}} came into a settled way of maintenance, which <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have best pleased with. Once, indeed, he asked me how I did to live. I {{answered}} him pretty quick, that I assured him I had never taken that course that I took with him, but that indeed I worked at my needle, and could just maintain myself; that sometime it was as much as I was able to do, and I shifted hard enough.|$|R

5000|$|During {{campaign}} fundraisers in August, Clinton reportedly explained her {{divide and}} conquer approach to courting Republican voters by putting Trump supporters into two [...] "baskets"—one being everyday Republicans which she would target, and the other being the [...] "alt-right" [...] crowd. During an interview on Israel's Channel 2 on September 8, 2016, Clinton said [...] "you can take Trump supporters {{and put them in}} two big baskets.

6000|$|... "Ah; that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{explain to}} you now,--here on this very spot,--if I could. Does it not seem odd that a girl should have all that she wants offered to her, and yet {{not be able to}} take it?" ...|$|E

And I guess you’d better do it in native; it’ll please the old lady,” I said, giving her the proper name of a man’s wife upon the spot.|$|R
5000|$|Murray Rothbard {{argues that}} the {{capitalist}} system of today is, indeed, not properly anarchistic because it so often colludes with the state. According to Rothbard, [...] "what Marx and later writers have done is to lump together two extremely different and even contradictory concepts and actions under the same portmanteau term. These two contradictory concepts <b>are</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> call 'free-market capitalism' on the one hand, and 'state capitalism' on the other." [...] "The difference between free-market capitalism and state capitalism," [...] writes Rothbard, [...] "is precisely the difference between, on the one hand, peaceful, voluntary exchange, and on the other, violent expropriation." [...] He continues, [...] "State capitalism inevitably creates all sorts of problems which become insoluble." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "That is {{just what}} I don't want to do. I {{want to see what}} these {{meetings}} are like, what sort of arguments are used, what the spirit of the people is, if I can. That <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> really like to find out, Aaron--the spirit of the people." ...|$|E
