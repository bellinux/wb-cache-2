Our algorithms work in a semi-online setting where all the inputs are known in advance and outcomes are unknown and given step by step. We apply the Aggregating Algorithm to construct a prediction method whose <b>cumulative</b> <b>loss</b> over all the input vectors is comparable with the <b>cumulative</b> <b>loss</b> of any linear functional on the Banach lattice. As a by-product we get an algorithm that takes signals from an arbitrary domain. Its <b>cumulative</b> <b>loss</b> is comparable with the <b>cumulative</b> <b>loss</b> of any predictor function from Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces. We describe several applications of our setting...|$|R

40|$|We are {{concerned}} with the problem of sequential prediction using a given hypothesis class of continuously-many prediction strategies. An effective performance measure is the minimax relative <b>cumulative</b> <b>loss</b> (RCL), which is the minimum of the worst-case difference between the <b>cumulative</b> <b>loss</b> for any prediction algorithm and that for the best assignment in a given hypothesis class. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to evaluate the minimax RCL for general continuous hypothesis classes under general losses. We first derive asymptotical upper and lower bounds on the minimax RCL to show that they match (k= 2 c) ln m within error of o(ln m) where k is the dimension of parameters for the hypothesis class, m is the sample size, and c is the constant depending on the loss function. We thereby show that the <b>cumulative</b> <b>loss</b> attaining the minimax RCL asymptotically coincides with the extended stochastic complexity (ESC), which is an extension of Rissanen's stochastic complexity (SC) into the decision- [...] ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} several ideas from {{sequential}} prediction of bounded, non-random se-quences are extended {{and applied to}} the problem of stochastic regression with an un-bounded response. We describe and analyze two sequential procedures for aggregating linear combinations of a finite family regression estimates. Both procedures are con-ceptually simple methods based on exponential weighting, and have tractable approx-imations. Neither assumes a standard additive model relating the response and the covariate vector. Analysis of each procedure begins with <b>cumulative</b> <b>loss</b> bounds. These bounds ex-tend related results for aggregating predictors of an individual sequence to the un-bounded regression setting, and to aggregation of uncountably many base estimates. From the <b>cumulative</b> <b>loss</b> bounds we derive several oracle type inequalities for the ag-gregate estimators produced by each procedure. The inequalities show that the risk of the aggregate estimator is less than the risk of the best candidate linear combination (with leading coefficient one), plus a complexity term that depends {{on the size of the}} coefficient set, plus a final term that depends only on the tail behavior of the response variable. From these inequalities we obtain convergence rates for model selection and convex aggregation that are within logarithmic factors of known minimax bounds. The <b>cumulative</b> <b>loss</b> bounds also yield oracle inequalities for data-dependent estimators and stationary, dependent covariates. Submitted for publicatio...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} {{trends in the}} {{proportion}} of annual live births that were male in Canada and to compare the trends with those in the United States. DESIGN: Analysis of census data. SETTING: Canada as a whole and 4 main regions (West, Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic). SUBJECTS: All live births from 1930 to 1990. OUTCOME MEASURES: Sex ratio (expressed as the proportion of total live births that were male [male proportion]) overall and by region. RESULTS: The male proportion in Canada decreased significantly after 1970 (p < 0. 001); this represented a <b>cumulative</b> <b>loss</b> of 2. 2 male births per 1000 live births from 1970 to 1990. Although a decrease was observed in all four regions studied, only that in the Atlantic region was significant (p < 0. 001), representing a <b>cumulative</b> <b>loss</b> of 5. 6 male births per 1000 live births from 1970 to 1990. A significant decrease in the male proportion was also observed in the United States from 1970 to 1990 (p < 0. 001), although to a lesser degree than that observed in Canada, and represented a <b>cumulative</b> <b>loss</b> of 1. 0 male births per 1000 live births. CONCLUSIONS: The decreased sex ratio in Canada adds to the growing debate over changes in biological markers and their potential causes. In addition, the study illustrates the potential use of the sex ratio as a widely available, unambiguous measure of the reproductive health of large populations...|$|R

40|$|A {{prediction}} rule in binary classification {{that aims}} to achieve the lowest probability of mis-classification involves minimizing over a non-convex, 0 - 1 loss function, which is typically a computationally intractable optimization prob-lem. To address the intractability, previous meth-ods consider minimizing the <b>cumulative</b> <b>loss</b> – the sum of convex surrogates of the 0 - 1 loss of each sample. We revisit this paradigm and de-velop instead an axiomatic framework by propos-ing a set of salient properties on functions for bi-nary classification and then propose the coherent loss approach, which is a tractable upper-bound of the empirical classification error over the en-tire sample set. We show that the proposed ap-proach yields a strictly tighter approximation to the empirical classification error than any convex <b>cumulative</b> <b>loss</b> approach while preserving the convexity of the underlying optimization prob-lem, and this approach for binary classification also has a robustness interpretation which builds a connection to robust SVMs. 1...|$|R
