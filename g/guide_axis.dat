40|$|Among the {{numerous}} techniques of non destructive evaluation, elastic guided waves {{are of particular}} interest to evaluate defects inside industrial and civil elongated structures owing to their ability to propagate over long distances. However for guiding structures buried in large solid media, waves can be strongly attenuated along the <b>guide</b> <b>axis</b> due to the energy radiation into the surrounding medium, usually considered as unbounded. Hence, searching the less attenuated modes become necessary in order to maximize the inspection distance. In the numerical modeling of embedded waveguides, the main difficulty is to account for the unbounded section. This paper presents a numerical approach combining a semi-analytical finite element method and a perfectly matched layer (PML) technique to compute the so-called trapped and leaky modes in three-dimensional embedded elastic waveguides of arbitrary cross-section. Two kinds of PML, namely the Cartesian PML and the radial PML, are considered.

40|$|International audienceA {{model is}} {{developed}} for the propagation of finite amplitude acoustical waves and weak shocks in a straight duct of arbitrary cross section. It generalizes the linear modal solution, assuming mode amplitudes slowly vary along the <b>guide</b> <b>axis</b> {{under the influence of}} nonlinearities. Using orthogonality properties, the model finally reduces to a set of ordinary differential equations for each mode at each of the harmonics of the input frequency. The theory is then applied to a two-dimensional waveguide. Dispersion relations indicate that there can be two types of nonlinear interactions either called ``resonant'' or ``non-resonant. '' Resonant interactions occur dominantly for modes propagating at a rather large angle with respect to the axis and involve mostly modes propagating with the same phase velocity. In this case, guided propagation is similar to nonlinear plane wave propagation, with the progressive steepening up to shock formation of the two waves that constitute the mode and reflect onto the guide walls. Non-resonant interactions can be observed as the input modes propagate at a small angle, in which case, nonlinear interactions involve many adjacent modes having close phase velocities. Grazing propagation can also lead to more complex phenomena such as wavefront curvature and irregular reflection. [DOI: 10. 1121 / 1. 3531799...|$|E

For this geometry we derive a multi-mode generalized Bose-Hubbard model for determining the quantum phases of the gas at the mechanical instability {{taking into account the}} quantum fluctuations in all directions of space. Our model limits the dimension of the numerically relevant Hilbert subspace by means of an appropriate decomposition of the field operator, which is obtained from a field theoretical model of the linear-zigzag instability.

Convergence tests at the linear-zigzag instability demonstrate that our multi-mode generalized Bose-Hubbard model can catch the essential features of the quantum phases of dipolar gases in confined geometries with a limited computational effort.

This thesis reports a series of studies of rare-earth-doped planar waveguide lasers, exploiting and extending the diverse range of possibilities that can be applied to planar technology. The areas investigated include the characterisation of guided-wave lasers produced by novel fabrication techniques, the design and implementation of new channel and planar waveguide structures and the demonstration of compact diode-bar pumped planar waveguide lasers. Laser operation of buried planar waveguides fabricated by a novel solid-state ion-exchange technique based on direct bonding is reported. The fabrication process allows buried waveguide structures to be fabricated by a single-step process, and the resulting guides are shown to have optical losses of < 0. 4 dB/cm. Direct UV writing is utilised to fabricate multiple channel sources on this buried platform, and absorbed pump power thresholds as low as 3 mW are demonstrated. These structures offer a new and versatile route to the large-scale production of low-loss components for glass integrated-optics. Lanthanum fluoride thin-films fabricated by molecular beam epitaxy are investigated. The first laser action from a dielectric waveguide fabricated by molecular beam epitaxy is demonstrated using Nd-doped LaF 3 thin films grown on CaF 2 substrates. Channel waveguide lasers are designed and fabricated on these thin films by two techniques; ion-beam etching and a novel technique that employs a photo-definable polymer. These structures have a maximum phonon-energy of 380 cm? 1, which constitutes the lowest phonon energy dielectric to show laser waveguide emission to date, offering the potential for developing compact mid-infrared sources based on this technology. The use of planar waveguides for very compact high-power sources is considered. Proximity coupling - the direct coupling of the diode-bar pump radiation is demonstrated for the first time and is used to realise a very compact and rugged laser system. Double-clad planar waveguide structures are utilised for spatial mode-control in the <b>guided</b> <b>axis</b> of the waveguide. To be compatible with planar fabrication techniques, and also due to the desire to retain a compact system, a double-clad design with large multimode core region is used.

The influence of <b>guide</b> vane (GV) <b>axis</b> was considered with invariable rotor blades and different variants of stator.

As an object, for investigation was chosen a numerical 3 D model of transonic stage of axial compressor with the following values of basic parameters: circumferential speed in the rotor blade trips of 345 m/s, relative diameter of the hub being 0. 7, and coefficient of discharge being 0. 5.

This paper discusses a system without friction that supplies air to an air bearing guide and initial functionality results of the elastically <b>guided</b> <b>axis.</b> Frictionless air supply to an air bearing guide When a compressed air flow is needed on board of an air bearing guide, a hose of a certain length is often required to provide the air supply. Besides on the length of the hose the magnitude of the flow depends on the speed of the air and on the diameter of the supply hose. In a case of a constant air speed, the diameter of the supply hose has to be increased when more flow is needed on board of the guide (e. g. when the guide contains many air bearings). This inevitably results in more bending and torsion stiffness in the hose, which is a source of disturbance during slide motion. Applying multiple hoses (with a smaller diameter) gives almost no improvement: the bending stiffness decreases but the air friction increases with the fourth power of the diameter. Multiple hoses may not contact while moving because friction causes hysteresis in the guide’s motion, which is often unacceptable. The hoses, often made from thermoplastic material, show relaxation and Bourdon action. The...|$|R

A guiding task of a flexible micropart {{is the case of}} the study and is achieved by a two-sensing-finger microgripper. An experimental model of the behavior of the microgripper is given and the interaction forces are studied. Based on grasp stability, a guiding strategy taking into account the pull off forces is proposed. A specific control strategy using an external hybrid force/position control and taking into account microscale specificities is proposed. The experimental results of automated guiding task are presented. Note to Practitioners — This article’s motivation is the need of very precise positioning in micromanipulation and microassembly tasks. The guiding tasks {{are a part of the}} microassembly process. Such guiding tasks are rarely automated. This is mainly due to the fact that automation in the microworld is a new issue and the literature only concerns the local control of microactuators and microrobots for the moment. Hybrid force/position control is a promising approach to achieve an automated guiding task of the micropart. To detect the contact between the micropart and the rail, a two-sensing-finger microgripper is used. The controller aims to release the contact and to continue going forward within the <b>guiding</b> <b>axis.</b> The proposed controller is very accurate, with high speed (low rejection time) and easy to implement.
