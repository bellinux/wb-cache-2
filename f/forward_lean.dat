5|$|England {{started their}} second innings 337 runs in arrears. Dewes took strike and {{got off the}} mark from Lindwall when he aimed a hook shot and was {{credited}} with a boundary when the ball came off his shoulder. Lindwall's steepling bouncer rose over his bat and narrowly missed his head. Soon after, Lindwall made the early breakthrough, bowling Dewes—who offered no shot—for 10 to leave England 20/1. Dewes had often committed to playing the ball from the front foot before the bowler delivered the ball, thereby putting himself into difficulty. This was because of his habit of leaning his weight onto his back foot as the ball was being bowled, which meant that a <b>forward</b> <b>lean</b> would instinctively result. Edrich joined Hutton and the pair consolidated the England innings, which reached 54/1 at the close at the second day's play, which was hastened by bad light.|$|E

2500|$|He {{designed}} {{his first}} ocean-going ship, the [...] brig Nautilus, in 1868, {{which was built}} at Eureka, {{in an attempt to}} get a faster ship for the Tahiti run. The hull of Nautilus was exactly the reverse of what was customary in the area at that time, being [...] "long and sharp <b>forward,</b> <b>lean</b> and full on the waterline aft." [...] Despite the predictions of sceptics that the ship would dive and pitch into the water, resulting in a very wet ride, Nautilus proved a great success. Turner decided to move into shipbuilding, setting up a yard near Hunter's Point with his brother Horatio. In 1876 he married for a second time, to Captain Rundle's widow, Ashbeline. The success of his first shipyard led him to search for another location, to allow the business to expand. He went into business with his brother and John Eckley, forming the Matthew Turner Shipyard at Benicia in 1883. This yard constructed at least 154 wooden-hulled ships.|$|E

40|$|Background. Previous {{work has}} found that healthy older men were {{significantly}} less able than young male adults to recover balance by taking a single rapid step upon sudden release from <b>forward</b> <b>leans.</b> In light of the higher rates of falls and fall-related injuries among older women compared to older men, we hypothesized that healthy older women would perform more poorly than either female young adults or older men in this test of abilities to recover balance rapidly. Methods. Ten young (mean age 25. 0 years) and 10 older (73. 7 years) healthy women were released from <b>forward</b> <b>leans</b> and instructed to regain standing balance by taking a single step <b>forward.</b> The <b>lean</b> angle was incrementally increased from its smallest value, approximately 14 °, until the subject failed to regain balance as instructed. Lower extremity kinematics were measured, and findings were {{compared with those of}} the earlier study of healthy young and old men. Results. Five of the 10 older women could not recover balance with a single step after release from the smallest of the imposed <b>forward</b> <b>leans.</b> For the 5 older women who succeeded in recovering as instructed from at least one lean, the mean maximum lean angle was significantly smaller than that for young women (16. 2 ° vs 30. 7 °, p <. 00 l) or older men (16. r vs 23. 9 °, p =. 014). In contrast, {{there was no significant difference}} in mean maximum lean angle between female and male young adults...|$|R

50|$|To score, {{a player}} must roll or bounce {{the ball down}} the length of the court, past the {{opposing}} defenders, and into the opponents' goal. Typically, the player with the ball will stand, orient themselves using the tactile lines, sounds from teammates, and/or the crossbar of their own goal. The player will then stride <b>forward,</b> <b>lean</b> low, and roll or sidearm the ball down the court.|$|E

50|$|With 122 {{yards rushing}} against the Syracuse Orange on October 23, 2010, Devine eclipsed 4,000 career rushing yards. He becomes the fourth player in Big East history to rush for 4,000 career yards joining fellow Mountaineers Avon Cobourne, Pat White and Rutgers' Ray Rice. A {{reason why he}} was not a top draft pick was because he had an ankle injury during his senior year and {{affected}} him in a big game against Louisiana State University (LSU). Draft experts say that Devine is too small and has a <b>forward</b> <b>lean</b> when he runs which causes him to fumble a lot. He also is too injury prone to be a top running back in the NFL.|$|E

40|$|Background: Although {{the squat}} {{exercise}} and its variations are commonly prescribed for {{anterior cruciate ligament}} rehabilitation, whether trunk position affects these ligament forces and strains during the squat is unclear. Our purpose was to evaluate the effects of trunk position on anterior cruciate ligament forces and strains during a single-leg squat. Methods: While instrumented for biomechanical analysis, twelve recreationally active subjects performed single-leg squats with minimal and moderate amounts of <b>forward</b> trunk <b>lean.</b> A combination of inverse dynamics, Hill-type muscle modeling, and mathematical computations estimated anterior cruciate ligament forces, strains and quadriceps, hamstrings, and gastrocnemius forces. Findings: The moderate <b>forward</b> trunk <b>lean</b> condition vs. minimal <b>forward</b> trunk <b>lean</b> condition had lower peak anterior cruciate ligament forces (down arrow 24 %), strains (down arrow 16 %), and average anterior cruciate ligament forces and strains during knee flexion ranges of motion of 25 - 55 degrees (descent) and 35 - 55 degrees (ascent). A moderate vs. minimal <b>forward</b> trunk <b>lean</b> also produced 35 % higher hamstring forces throughout {{the majority of the}} squat, but lower quadriceps forces only at knee flexion angles greater than 65 degrees. Interpretation: Single-leg squats performed with a moderate <b>forward</b> trunk <b>lean</b> (similar to 40) can minimize anterior cruciate ligament loads. Mechanistically, trunk lean reduced anterior cruciate ligament forces and strains through concomitant modulations in hip flexion angle and biarticular thigh muscle forces. These findings are clinically relevant for anterior cruciate ligament rehabilitation as a common goal is to minimize anterior cruciate ligament forces and strains through enhancing hamstring and quadriceps co-contractions.

5000|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} types of body positioning to portray certain postures, including slouching, towering, legs spread, jaw thrust, shoulders forward, and arm crossing. The posture or bodily stance exhibited by individuals communicates a variety of messages whether good or bad. Posture can be used to determine a participant's degree of attention or involvement, the difference in status between communicators, and the level of fondness a person has for the other communicator, depending on body [...] "openness". Studies investigating the impact of posture on interpersonal relationships suggest that mirror-image congruent postures, where one person's left side is parallel to the other person's right side, leads to favorable perception of communicators and positive speech; a person who displays a <b>forward</b> <b>lean</b> or decreases a backward lean also signifies positive sentiment during communication.Posture can be situation-relative, that is, people will change their posture depending on the situation they are in.|$|E

5000|$|Born in Streatham {{in south}} London, Brown {{grew up as}} a fan of Barnet as {{his father was a}} keen fan of the club, {{regularly}} attending games at Underhill Stadium via the London Underground. At the age of 18, Brown joined his boyhood club as his father had local connections to the club and he was offered a contract by manager George Wheeler. On his arrival, club captain Alf D'Arcy described Brown as [...] "A very gifted centre <b>forward,</b> <b>lean</b> and so quick but unusually with a sharp brain to go with it! He would take a row with a centre half in his stride and yet out-think his opponent, and he was incredibly fit too". In his first season at the club, he scored 41 times in all competitions to help the club win the Athenian League in the 1958-59 season and reach the final of the FA Amateur Cup, losing 3-2 to Crook Town with Brown scoring both goals for the Bees. However, his appearances were limited during the following season due to injury and Brown finished the season with 17 goals. During his time at Barnet, Brown also worked as a fishmonger in Billingsgate Fish Market.|$|E
5000|$|The head, left arm, {{lower right}} arm, {{most of the}} wings and the feet are missing. Even so, it can be {{recognised}} that the left leg is slightly further forward, while the right leg {{seems to have been}} pulled back. This posture in connection with the <b>forward</b> <b>lean</b> of the figure as a whole is also a characteristic posture in later depictions of Nike like the Nike of Paionos. In the classical period this posture replaced the archaic [...] "kneeling run" [...] as the usual way of depicting Nike. The forward slope of the body's axis, which is created mainly by the straightness of the upper body and the strong incline of the lower body to the left, would have made the whole figure tilt slightly and would have shifted all weight off the left leg. The left arm must be reconstructed as having stretched upwards, when the figure was fixed in place. It is the resulting disregard for the rules of gravity which gave the Nike of Paros the appearance of floating. A transition takes place then in statuary from a sideways to a forward moving figure, {{as a result of the}} change in pose.|$|E
40|$|Motorcycling postures are generically speculated to be {{physical}} and physiologically demanding – which in-turn {{may lead to}} motorcycling fatigue, and then becoming a possible factor to road accident. The objective {{of this study was}} to measure the muscular activities of various motorcycling postures. High muscular activity reading will signifies that motorcycling is indeed physically and physiologically demanding to the motorcyclist. For this particular study, the following postures were tested: i) <b>forward</b> <b>lean,</b> ii) upright sitting, and iii) neutral sitting (as control). Surface electromyography (sEMG) measurement was conducted on the following muscles: i) extensor carpi radialis, ii) upper trapezius iii) latissimus dorsi, and iv) erector spinae. The results showed that for all test subjects, the muscular activities readings for the <b>forward</b> <b>lean</b> posture was actually close to neutral sitting’s. Whilst, the upright sitting had showed much higher muscular activities measurement instead. Conclusively, this study had proven that any types of discomforts associated with the <b>forward</b> <b>lean</b> posture is not originated from muscular activities. Whereas, confirming that any discomforts in regards to the upright sitting is indeed related to muscular activities. Further studies are warranted to discover the actual risk factors that causes {{physical and}} physiological discomforts for the <b>forward</b> <b>lean</b> motorcycling posture...|$|E
