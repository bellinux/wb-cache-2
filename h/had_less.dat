5|$|A new aft-loaded shape which {{produced}} lift across {{most of the}} upper wing surface, instead of a narrow band as in previous airfoil designs, {{was used for the}} 757's wings. The more efficient wings <b>had</b> <b>less</b> drag and greater fuel capacity, and were similar in configuration to those on the 767. A wider wingspan than the 727's produced less lift-induced drag, while larger wing roots increased undercarriage storage space and provided room for future stretched versions of the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Allied {{control of}} the Atlantic meant German meteorologists <b>had</b> <b>less</b> {{information}} than the Allies on incoming weather patterns. As the Luftwaffe meteorological centre in Paris was predicting two weeks of stormy weather, many Wehrmacht commanders left their posts to attend war games in Rennes, and men in many units were given leave. Field Marshal Erwin Rommel returned to Germany for his wife's birthday and to meet with Hitler to try to obtain more Panzers.|$|E

50|$|One {{problem for}} reverse-learning {{theory is that}} dreams are often {{organized}} into clear narratives (stories). It is unclear why dreams would be organized in a systematic way if they consisted only of disposable parasitic thoughts. It is also unclear why babies sleep so much, because it seems they would <b>have</b> <b>less</b> to forget. Additionally, the brain of the echidna <b>has</b> far <b>less</b> folding than the brains of other mammals, so <b>has</b> <b>less</b> surface area (the location of the neo-cortex). It may actually <b>have</b> <b>less</b> capacity for higher thought than that of other mammals, rather than more, as its greater mass suggests.|$|R

5|$|Due {{to their}} {{appearance}} in the 2008 Stanley Cup Finals, the Penguins <b>had</b> <b>less</b> than three weeks before free agency began to settle numerous contract decisions. The Penguins added nine free agents and lost ten to other teams. Head Coach Michel Therrien also signed a new three-year contract that replaced {{the last year of}} his existing contract, with an increase in salary. The new contract was projected to keep him with the Penguins through the 2010–11 season.|$|E
5|$|During {{the same}} period, the club changed its {{official}} language from Castilian to Catalan and gradually evolved into an important symbol of Catalan identity. For many fans, {{participating in the}} club <b>had</b> <b>less</b> {{to do with the}} game itself and more with being a part of the club's collective identity. On 4 February 1917, the club held its first testimonial match to honour Ramón Torralba who played from 1913 to 1928. The match was against local side Terrassa, which Barcelona won 6–2.|$|E

He lost in the qualifying event, although was selected by the Tripartite Commission to attend the Beijing Olympics to supplement the Grenada Olympic team, which historically had <b>had</b> <b>less</b> than six people and thus qualified for the aid.|$|E
5|$|Historian Katharine Glover {{argues that}} women <b>had</b> <b>less</b> means of public {{participation}} than men {{and that as}} a result piety and an active religious life may have been more important for women from the social elite. Church going played an important part in the lives of many women. Women were largely excluded from the administration of the kirk, but when heads of households voted on the appointment of a new minister some parishes allowed women in that position to participate.|$|E
30|$|It can be {{seen that}} the {{proposed}} canonic REFFTs/ROFFTs <b>have</b> <b>less</b> signals, less butterfly operations, and less twiddle factor operations. Due {{to the fact that the}} canonic ROFFT <b>has</b> <b>less</b> signal values at each stage compared to canonic REFFT, the canonic ROFFT also requires less butterfly operations.|$|R

In 1987 and 1989, horned dinosaur specialist Peter Dodson was invited to investigate the new ceratopsian finds. In 1990, the fossil material was seen by Dodson as strengthening the case for the validity of a separate Styracosaurus ovatus, to be distinguished from Styracosaurus albertensis.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{examination}} of daily moods in women with measuring ovarian hormones may indicate a less powerful connection. In comparison to levels of stress or physical health, the ovarian hormones <b>had</b> <b>less</b> of an impact on overall mood. This indicates that while changes of ovarian hormones may influence mood, on a day-to-day level it does not influence mood more than other stressors do.|$|E

5|$|Jair {{played on}} the same team as Diego, and was a slimmer, more {{technically}} able player, but <b>had</b> <b>less</b> focus; the two were often not fielded {{at the same time in}} order to prevent arguments.

5|$|Since David {{wrote about}} Mediterranean food in 1950, and indeed since dietary {{researchers}} {{showed in the}} 1950s that people around the Mediterranean <b>had</b> <b>less</b> coronary heart disease than the peoples of northern Europe, the traditional Mediterranean ways of life and of eating have changed. Increased wealth and busy lives have led people to eat more meat and less vegetables: their diet is becoming more northern European, with more convenience foods and with less of a preventative effect on cardiovascular disease.|$|E
5|$|The strike action led to {{a backlog}} of tens of {{millions}} of items of undelivered mail, with an estimated 30 million letters and parcels affected after the first wave of walkouts, and rising to in excess of 50 million following the second. Businesses in London were forced to lay off staff, or defer paying them, generally because they were unable to dispatch goods or couldn't receive payment for them. However, the strikes <b>had</b> <b>less</b> of an impact outside the capital.|$|E
5|$|As the Yorkists {{reformed}} {{their ranks}} {{to receive the}} Lancastrian charge, their left flank came under attack by the horsemen from Castle Hill Wood mentioned by Waurin. The Yorkist left wing fell into disarray and several men started to flee. Edward had to take command of the left wing to save the situation. By engaging in the fight and encouraging his followers, his example inspired many to stand their ground. The armies clashed and archers shot into the mass of men at short range. The Lancastrians continuously threw fresher men into the fray and gradually the numerically inferior Yorkist army was forced to give ground and retreat up the southern ridge. Gravett thought that the Lancastrian left <b>had</b> <b>less</b> momentum {{than the rest of}} its formation, skewing the line of battle such that its western end tilted towards Saxton.|$|E
