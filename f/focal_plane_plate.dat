40|$|A simple, yet general, {{formalism}} for the optimized {{linear combination}} of astrophysical images is constructed and demonstrated. The formalism allows {{the user to}} combine multiple undersampled images to provide oversampled output at high precision. The proposed method is general and {{may be used for}} any configuration of input pixels and point spread function; it also provides the noise covariance in the output image along with a powerful metric for describing undesired distortion to the image convolution kernel. The method explicitly provides knowledge and control of the inevitable compromise between noise and fidelity in the output image. We present a first prototype implementation of the method, outlining steps taken to generate an efficient algorithm. This implementation is then put to practical use in reconstructing fully-sampled output images using simulated, undersampled input exposures that are designed to mimic the proposed Wide Field InfraRed Survey Telescope (WFIRST). We examine results using randomly rotated and dithered input images, while also assessing better-known "ideal" dither patterns: comparing results we illustrate the use of the method as a survey design tool. Finally, we use the method to test the robustness of linear image combination when subject to practical realities such as missing input pixels and <b>focal</b> <b>plane</b> <b>plate</b> scale variations.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} techniques involved in using a fiber optic coupled spectrometer to do multiple object spectroscopy of astronomical objects. The Medusa spectrograph, with optical fibers fixed in a <b>focal</b> <b>plane</b> aperture <b>plate,</b> {{was used to}} study clusters of galaxies via velocity distributions. Some relevant problems {{in the study of}} the structure and dynamics of clusters of galaxies are outlined as motivation for building a multiple fiber spectrometer. The history of fiber optic spectroscopy in astronomy is presented along with an outlook for the future. The results and experience gained from the Medusa spectrograph are used to design a second generation instrument. The MX Spectrometer uses optical fibers which are positioned remotely under computer control. These fibers are optically matched to the telescope and spectrograph optics to achieve optimum performance. The transmission, flexibility, and image scrambling properties of step-index silica fibers allow efficient reformatting of multiple objects into the spectrometer entrance aperature. By allowing spectra of 32 objects to be obtained simultaneously, the MX Spectrometer will make an order of magnitude increase in the quantity of spectroscopic data that can be recorded with a large telescope. Mechanical, control, and optical elements of the MX design are discussed. Telescope and fiber parameters influencing the design of the fishermen-around-the-pond mobile fiber head are detailed. Results of testing the stepper motor driven fiber positioner probes are described. The algorithm for controlling the motion of 32 positioners in the telescope <b>focal</b> <b>plane</b> without collisions is outlined. Detector performance and spectrometer efficiency are considered for both the Medusa and MX systems. The use of a Charge Coupled Device (CCD) array detector provides increased quantum efficiency, dynamic range, and stability, as well as allowing digital sky subtraction. Microlenses and their use in correctly coupling optical fibers to the telescope and spectrograph are discussed. In particular, the pupil-imaging technique for microlens matching to fibers is introduced...|$|R
40|$|The next {{generation}} wide-field X-ray telescope (WFXT) will require an angular resolution of ~ 5 - 10 arcsec almost constant {{across a wide}} field of view (~ 1 deg 2 diameter). To achieve this goal, {{the design of the}} optical system has to be based on mirrors characterized by short length and polynomial profiles, as well as <b>focal</b> <b>plane</b> curvature and <b>plate</b> scale corrections. These concepts guarantee an improved angular resolution at large off-axis angle with respect to the normally used Wolter-I configuration. These telescopes are therefore optimal for survey purposes. A significant increase of effective area and grasp with respect to previous missions must also be achieved. This is possible with high precision {{but at the same time}} thin (2 - 3 mm thickness for mirror diameters of 30 - 110 cm) glass mirror shells. To achieve the goal of 5 arcsec and improve further the technology, we are considering different materials. Fused silica, a well-known material with good thermo-mechanical and polishability characteristics provide the best choice. To bring the mirror shells to the needed accuracy, we are adopting a deterministic direct polishing method (already used for past missions as Einstein, Rosat, Chandra). The technological challenge now is to apply it for almost ten times thinner shells...|$|R

30|$|From Eqs. (14) and (17), several {{important}} {{conclusions can be}} derived. First, movement of the camera will not produce equal movement of the <b>focal</b> <b>plane</b> unless n_m/n_ 0 = 1.
