This experiment used changes in physical and chemical composition <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> to predict it's ripening rate. Moisture content <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> was determined by using desiccation method and ripening stage <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> was determined by peel colour.

Applying moisture absorber in banana packaging supported my hypothesis that reducing relative humidity of packaging environment can speed up ripening process. However, moisture absorber is not able to absorb excess water droplet cause by sweeting of fruit. The results showed that moisture absorber and oxygen absorber were not suitable to be used in either promoting or delaying ripening process <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> because active packaging cannot solve sweating problem leading to deterioration <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> fruits. ...|$|R

40|$|In México, banana (Musa sp.) {{varieties}} {{are used for}} human consumption {{as well as for}} traditional medicine, but the literature lacks information on local diversity and functional justification for their use. Three varieties <b>of</b> dessert <b>bananas</b> (Valery, Morado, and Enano) and one cooking banana (Macho) were collected in a commercial farm in Tuxtepec, Oaxaca, México, at the agronomic maturity stage, and they were physically and chemically evaluated. A random sampling, ANOVA, and Tukey tests were used. As compared to the dessert bananas, the cooking banana (Macho) showed a lower number <b>of</b> <b>hands</b> per <b>banana</b> bunch (6) and <b>of</b> fingers per <b>hands</b> (6), one <b>of</b> the smallest bunch yields (about 12. 4 kg), a higher average finger weight (349 g), length (31. 7 cm), girth (17 cm), starch amount (75. 7 %, dry basis), resistant starch (59. 2 % db), and greater firmness (10. 2 N). Values of extractable polyphenols (EP), condensed tannins (CT), and hydrolysable tannins (HT) were higher for Morado variety, followed by Macho. The antioxidant capacity of EP, CT, and HT fluctuated among varieties. The Morado variety exhibited the lowest pasting temperature, lowest onset temperature, highest peak viscosity, and highest breakdown than those of the other varieties.

30|$|The {{proposed}} technique bears {{at least}} three advantages. First, it leverages a training process to extract automatically multi-scale image features combining both the global and local features <b>of</b> the <b>banana</b> image.

Second, as the samples <b>of</b> <b>bananas</b> with imperfections are also included in the experiments, the experimental results also validate that our method can be applied to fine-grained classification <b>of</b> <b>bananas</b> at different ripening stages no matter the banana peel bears defects or not. Third, different from some existing methods [32], our indicator does not combine any information from the physiochemical or biological changes during the ripening process <b>of</b> <b>banana.</b> However, it is still able to achieve competitive classification accuracy as validated by our experiments.|$|R
