5|$|Edwards is a far-right {{political}} activist <b>from</b> <b>Memphis,</b> Tennessee, {{described by the}} Southern Poverty Law Center as a rising star of the modern white-nationalist movement.

He attended Briarcrest Christian School, a private school in Memphis, and in ninth grade transferred into a Christian-nationalist homeschooling program, a decision that he said led him into political activism. In 2000 he volunteered for Pat Buchanan's presidential campaign, and in 2002 ran unsuccessfully for the Tennessee House of Representatives.

5|$|If Sheshi {{is to be}} {{equated with}} Salitis, then the seals of Sheshi {{discovered}} in Nubia suggest that the Hyksos allied themselves with the Nubians against the native Egyptian 13th Dynasty {{as soon as they}} arrived in the Nile Delta, an event which Grimal places c. 1720 BC. Grimal envisions Sheshi's kingdom as comprising the entire Nile Delta and the Nile valley north of Gebelein.

5|$|In Amenhotep I's ninth regnal year, a heliacal rise of Sothis was {{observed}} {{on the ninth}} day of the third month of summer. Modern astronomers have calculated that, if the observation was made <b>from</b> <b>Memphis</b> or Heliopolis, such an observation {{could only have been}} made on that day in 1537 BC. If the observation was made in Thebes, however, it could only have taken place in 1517 BC. The latter choice is usually accepted as correct since Thebes was the capital during the early 18th dynasty; hence, Amenhotep I is usually given an accession date in 1526 BC, although the possibility of 1546 BC is not entirely dismissed.|$|E
