500|$|The least {{expensive}} route for Kanae to Japan was through Russia. [...] He set off from Paris on 30 June 1916 via England, Norway, and Sweden. [...] In Moscow {{he met the}} Japanese consul and the social critic Noburu Katagami; the latter introduced him to proletarian art and encouraged him to visit Yasnaya Polyana, Leo Tolstoy's home which he had made into a farmers' school. [...] The experienced moved Kanae, who later was to write, [...] "While I was staying in Moscow {{in the summer of}} 1916, I felt that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>two</b> important missions. [...] One was promotion of children's free painting and the other was establishment of farmers' art." [...] Kanae visited the Moscow Kustar' Museum, which had exhibited peasant arts and crafts since 1885. [...] He praised its sturdy quality and ethnic design, and lamented that industrialization had brought about a degradation in its perceived value and was threatening its survival. [...] An exhibition of children's art impressed Kanae with its free expressiveness.|$|E

[...] Zombie is also quoted as saying [...] "I was getting very {{conceptual}} in my own mind with it. [...] A lot of times these movies would be made like, 'Well, you know, I've got a whole bunch of Nazi uniforms, but I got this Chinese set too. We'll put 'em together!'

He has written about the role that cricket played {{in the collapse of}} the relationship, comparing his circumstances with those of then England batsman Graham Thorpe. He also found that his job interfered with his relationship with his children: <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>two</b> young children, aged seven and five... it was quickly evident that for me to have custody of my daughters – or even to form a relationship with them – was made impossible by my job.

There was one occasion when I did not recognise my eldest, Jennifer, when I returned from one tour... my children continue to ask me why I did not resign and take a job that would have kept me in the country and allowed me to see them more often. I find that one especially hard to answer."

TV Squad's Jay Black said that Michael summed up [...] "Night Out" [...] perfectly when he said [...] "Best. Night. Ever." [...] Black went on to praise both of the storylines, and the ability of the show to achieve success both in as well as out of the Dunder Mifflin Scranton building. Similar to Black's statements, Gretchen Hansen of Entertainment Weekly stated that Best. Night. Ever.' Oh, so true, Michael." [...] She also stated that [...] "I guess I {{knew it was going to}} be a good episode of The Office when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>two</b> pages of scribbled notes before the first commercial break." [...] Hansen went on to praise both the acting and the writing of the episode as points that contributed to the success of the episode. Rachel Cericola, of TV Fodder, praised the writing of the episode by Mindy Kaling. She also praised the storyline of the episode that did not involve Michael and Dwight, saying [...] "The second plotline was its usual funny filler. However, it was Toby's revelation that made it all worthwhile." ...|$|E

A number of the characters were recast until {{one of the few}} remaining original actors, Jaime Lyn Bauer, who portrayed Lorie Brooks, decided to leave. When she announced her intention not to renew her contract, Bell decided to replace the original core families. [...] "As I studied the remaining cast, I realized <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>two</b> characters- Paul Williams, played by Doug Davidson, and Jack Abbott, played by Terry Lester- both of whom had a relatively insignificant presence on the show," [...] Bell said.

2500|$|The deep cabin of the Feiro <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>two</b> rows {{side-by-side}} seats; {{the front}} pair could both {{be equipped with}} flight controls or one of then {{could serve as a}} third passenger seat. Because the high engine fairing reached the underside of the wing leading edge, there was no central forward view from the controls; instead, there were deep openings on either side. [...] Access to the cabin was via a port side door. Behind the cabin the fuselage tapered to the tail where a short, broad fin carried a deep rudder. The tailplane was also mounted on the fin, just above the fuselage so that it could be used to trim the aircraft by altering its angle of incidence. It had swept leading edges, square tips and carried elevators with a cut-out for rudder movement. The fixed tail surfaces were ply skinned and the control surfaces fabric covered.|$|E

2500|$|In 1976, Guzzi {{released}} the 850 Le Mans, a cafe racer {{that was a}} stylistic masterpiece and still today {{considered one of the}} most iconic and sought-after of all Guzzis. A marketing success that would compete with other Italian superbikes, it spawned four later models from Mark II to its culmination in the 1990s, the Mark V. The initial model is known widely but incorrectly as the Mark I. Technically, it is simply the 850 Le Mans. It was named in homage to the 24-hour endurance race and circuit in France. The Mark <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>two</b> production runs with slight modifications. The first run, known as Series 1, used the roundish CEV stop/taillight used on many Italian bikes of the decade. Fewer than 2,000 of the round taillight bikes were made and they are the most desirable Guzzi of the era. The second production run, known as the Series 2 and totaling around 4,000 bikes, used a De Tomaso-designed rectangular taillight/reflector and modified rear guard. This was also used on the Mark II and SP models. The taillight and guard was the biggest change between Series 1 and 2 but other modifications included later inclusion of a tripmeter, black fork lowers, a more generous dual seat that replaced the split-prone original seat, exhaust pipe heel guards and inferior fuel taps. The extra cost compared to the [...] "cooking" [...] T3 model paid for performance items such as high-compression domed pistons, larger inlet and exhaust valves and Dell'Orto 36mm pumper carbs with filterless grey plastic velocity stacks. Most Mk I bikes were brilliant red although a very small number were painted in metallic ice blue. An exceedingly small number of Series 2 bikes were white.|$|E
2500|$|Israel (ranked 8th in the Davis Cup standings, with 5,394 points) hosted heavily favored Russia (which won in both 2002 and 2006, and was {{the top-ranked}} country in Davis Cup standings, with 27,897 points) in a Davis Cup quarterfinal tie in July 2009, on indoor hard courts at the Nokia Arena in Tel Aviv. [...] Israel was {{represented}} by Ram, Erlich, Dudi Sela, and Harel Levy. [...] Russia's lineup consisted of Marat Safin (# 24 in the world; former world # 1), Igor Andreev (26), Igor Kunitsyn (35), and Mikhail Youzhny (44; former world # 8). [...] The stage was set by Safin, who prior to the tie told the press: [...] "With all due respect, Israel was lucky {{to get to the}} quarterfinals." [...] The Israeli team's response was to beat the Russian team in each of their first three matches, thereby winning the tie. [...] Levy, world # 210, beat Russia's top player, Andreev, world # 24, 6–4, 6–2, 4–6, 6–2 in the opening match. [...] Sela (# 33) followed by beating Russian Youzhny 3–6, 6–1, 6–0, 7–5. [...] Israeli captain Eyal Ran likened his players to two fighter jets on court, saying: [...] "I felt as if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>two</b> F-16s out there today, they played amazingly well." [...] The 10,500 spectators were the largest crowd ever for a tennis match in Israel. [...] The next day Ram and Erlich beat Safin and Kunitsyn 6–3, 6–4, 6–7, 4–6, 6–4 in front of a boisterous crowd of over 10,000. [...] "I started to cry like a little boy", said Ram. [...] Even the Saudi Gazette described the doubles match as a [...] "thrilling" [...] win. [...] Captain Ran was carried shoulder-high around the Tel Aviv stadium, as the 10,000-strong crowd applauded. [...] With the tie clinched for Israel, the reverse singles rubbers were [...] "dead", and instead of best-of-five matches, best-of-three sets were played, with the outcomes of little to no importance. Israel wrapped up a 4–1 victory over Russia, as Levy defeated Kunitsyn 6–4, 4–6, 7–6, while Sela retired with a wrist injury while down 3–4 in the first set against Andreev. Ram said: [...] "We have all grown up together since the age of 14. The reason we are in the semis is because we are a united team." ...|$|E
