O primeiro capítulo apresentará a definição do IDH, suas particularidades, metodologia de cálculo e sua estruturação, através da observação das três variáveis, que compõem o indicador na atualidade: renda per capita, saúde e educação. No segundo capítulo, será elaborada uma análise comentada e comparada do IDH brasileiro em termos regionais (internos) para que se possam compreender as discrepâncias existentes dentro de um mesmo país, sendo útil, quando analisarmos o IDH brasileiro de forma geral. No terceiro e quarto capítulos, faremos a análise do IDH entre nações, demonstrando a evolução ou retrocesso que cada país obteve ao longo dos anos, suas deficiências em determinados setores sociais ou econômicos, as características e as razões dos países apresentarem variáveis otimizadoras de qualidade de vida em detrimento de nações que possuem índices medianos e outras em situações precárias. Serão analisadas, também, as divergências existentes entre as diversas regiões do globo, em especial os Estados Árabes, a África Subsaariana e a América Latina, dentre outros. No quarto capítulo, mostraremos o IDH de 2007, e mais um breve relato do IDH de 2008 (que possui seus dados relativos aos indicadores de 2006), a inserção do Brasil no contexto latino e mundial, a observação dos primeiros colocados, dos últimos, e as alterações nas posições relativas que levaram esses países a obterem essas classificações. No quinto capítulo, concluiremos apresentando as principais críticas feitas ao índice, em razão de o mesmo não retratar com fidelidade a condição de desenvolvimento que uma nação se encontra, ao mesmo tempo em que discutimos inclusões de outras variáveis, que poderiam fazer do IDH um índice mais preciso.
