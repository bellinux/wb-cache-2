The research objective was to evaluate the capabilities of specific actuator motor and <b>gearbox</b> <b>assemblies</b> under various design basis loading conditions. The testing was performed using the motor-operated valve load simulator, a test fixture that simulates the stem load profiles a valve actuator would experience when closing a valve against flow and pressure loadings. The authors tested five typical motors (four ac motors and one dc motor) with three <b>gearbox</b> <b>assemblies</b> at conditions a motor might experience in a power plant, including such off-normal conditions as operation at high temperature and reduced voltage. The authors also determined {{the efficiency of the}} actuator gearbox. The testing produced the following significant results: all five motors operated at or above their rated torque during tests at full voltage and ambient temperature; for all five motors (dc as well as ac), the actual torque loss due to voltage degradation was greater than the torque loss predicted using common methods; startup torques in locked rotor tests compared well with stall torques in dynamometer-type tests; the methods commonly used to predict torque losses due to elevated operating temperatures sometimes bounded the actual losses, but not in all cases; the greatest discrepancy involved the prediction for the dc motor; running efficiencies published by the manufacturer for actuator gearboxes were higher than the actual efficiencies determined from testing, in some instances, the published pullout efficiencies were also higher than the actual values; operation of the gearbox at elevated temperature did not affect the operating efficiency...|$|R

50|$|Fitted with {{coil spring}} {{suspension}} and drum brakes, the AML lacks hydraulic assist on either brakes or steering; only front wheels steer. Consequently, {{the steering wheel}} requires considerable strength to turn while the vehicle is in motion - while stationary it remains effectively locked. Much like the Ferret, rear wheel drive is transmitted directly to epicyclic hub reduction gears, also known as bevel boxes. The motor and gearbox have been harnessed via a centrifugal clutch with electromagnetic control, {{eliminating the need for}} a clutch pedal. This type of clutch is automatically engaged by gripping the knob of the gearshift lever, which is located behind the driver's seat in the hull floor. The <b>gearbox</b> <b>assembly</b> consists of two separate gearboxes, one for high and the other for low gear. The low-range gearbox is designed for off-road use and has a reverse gear and a top gear, while the high-range box is for operation on roads and has three low gears and one overdrive. There is a hydraulic dual-circuit handbrake operating on the gearbox output shaft.|$|E

50|$|The Imp was {{a massive}} and {{expensive}} leap of faith for Rootes. The company did not have recent experience building small cars, even though it started off as a car builder by offering the then small Hillman Minx back in 1931. However, the Minx had since grown larger, {{and by the time}} the Imp was introduced it was well established as a medium-size family car. For the Imp, Rootes pioneered the use of an aluminium engine in a mass-production car. This process proved to be more complicated than simply substituting an aluminium design for a familiar and well-understood cast-iron design. Rootes had to build a new, computerised assembly plant on the outskirts of Paisley, in Linwood, in which to assemble the Imp. The UK Government Regional Assistance policy provided financial grants to the Rootes Group to bring approximately 6,000 jobs to the area. Linwood had become an area of significant unemployment because of redundancies in the declining shipbuilding industry on the nearby River Clyde. The investment also included an advanced die-casting plant to manufacture the aluminium engine casings, and a stake in a brand new Pressed Steel Company motor pressings works, which manufactured all the new car's body panels. The location of the plant led to significant logistical issues for the manufacturing process. Linwood was over 300 mi away from Rootes' main factory at Ryton-on-Dunsmore, but the engine castings made in Linwood had to be sent to Ryton to be machined and assembled, then sent back up to be put on the cars - a 600 mi round trip. This was addressed by a complex schedule of trains shifting completed cars and raw castings south, and trains loaded with engine - <b>gearbox</b> <b>assemblies</b> and many other Ryton sourced goods running north. To aid with balancing the logistical costs of this operation, body pressings for the Hillman Avenger were also made at Linwood, but transported south to Ryton on the component trains. This schedule remained in operation for the duration of Linwood Imp production.|$|R

40|$|Helicopter {{manufacturers}} typically build each {{aircraft to}} order, {{and the lead}} time for make or buy parts and assemblies can be several months or more. The manufacturers generally have a backlog of orders at any given time, so customers in the helicopter market can expect to wait several months for delivery. However, due to the current economic conditions causing softened demand in the industry, some manufacturers have worked through most of their backlog and now have a finished goods inventory that allows for little or no wait for customer delivery, providing these companies a sales advantage. Between this effect of market conditions and recognition of the cost reduction benefits associated with shorter product lead times, successful helicopter companies with continued high demand and backlog, such as Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation, are seeking ways to deliver helicopters in a consistently shorter time frame. In the past, Sikorsky has approached the issue through speculative ordering and parts production prior to customer point of order. This approach has had limited success due to higher than forecasted variability in demand. In order {{to provide a more}} optimal means for speculative ordering and parts fabrication, the cause of demand variability was explored and implementation of a parts supermarket of critical, high lead time parts was considered. The solution proposed would be used as a pilot to ensure a consistent, shortened lead time for the main <b>gearbox</b> <b>assembly.</b> This methodology could then be applied to other sections of the helicopter. Analysis of the proposed supermarket reveals that by properly sizing the safety stock of 26 critical parts and using disciplined parts ordering, the objective lead time could be met. The calculated findings indicate large opportunities for cost savings in the implementation of this supermarket by offsetting original and spare parts demand to reduce variability, and by helping suppliers to establish reliable lead times through more consistent ordering patterns at Sikorsky. by Brendon Bielat.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a comprehensive methodology for predicting and minimising the noise radiated from a constant speed <b>gearbox</b> <b>assembly</b> {{by means of}} attaching optimally placed stiffening ribs on the casing. The procedure involves building an FE model of the gearbox, which is updated using modal parameters extracted from a modal test. This is followed by synthesis of the required FRFs {{with respect to the}} forcing degrees-of-freedom. The forces, which are assumed to act only at the bearings are identified from these FRFs and the measured operational velocities of the casing. The identified forces are then used to excite the updated FE model to re-calculate the vibration velocities. A boundary element method is used to calculate the final radiated sound power to be compared with that measured. The same forces are used later to excite the modified gearbox casing to determine the improvement given by optimised modification. The optimisation study minimises the vibration energy of the casing in 10 % bands around critical frequencies, in this case the first two harmonics of the gearmesh frequency. To allow for errors in the model, the excitation is by white noise, so as to produce wide stop bands, rather than minimising the response at particular frequencies. The vibration energy is weighted for radiation efficiency, A-weighting, and relative source strength in the bands. The final optimal stiffener layout is validated through a final vibration and acoustic calculation on the updated gearbox model using the forces identified in the earlier steps. The study of one particular gearbox concludes that i) the proposed hybrid optimisation scheme produces a theoretical effective noise reduction of 3 dBA for the total sound power. ii) Because the gearmesh harmonics were targeted, a further 5 dB improvement was effectively gained by eliminating the tonal penalty which otherwise applied. iii) From plate studies it was demonstrated that the stiffening ribs could be attached using epoxy cement (to avoid welding) and that the properties of the cemented joint could be determined by model updating after attaching one rib, so as to obtain a better prediction of the final optimised result...|$|E
40|$|The 3 -MW Alstom {{wind turbine}} was {{installed}} at NREL's NWTC in October 2010. Test {{data will be}} used to validate advanced turbine design and analysis tools. NREL signed a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with Alstom in 2010 to conduct certification testing on the company's 3 -MW ECO 100 wind turbine and to validate models of Alstom's unique drivetrain concept. The turbine was installed at NREL's National Wind Technology Center (NWTC) in October 2010 and engineers began certification testing in 2011. Tests to be conducted by NREL include a power quality test to finalize the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) requirements for type certification of the 60 -Hz unit. The successful outcome of this test will enable Alstom to begin commercial production of ECO 100 in the United States. NREL also will obtain additional measurements of power performance, acoustic noise, and system frequency to complement the 50 Hz results previously completed in Europe. After NREL completes the certification testing on the ECO 100, it will conduct long-term testing to validate gearbox performance {{to gain a better understanding}} of the machine's unique ALSTOM PURE TORQUE{trademark} drivetrain concept. In conventional wind turbines, the rotor is supported by the shaft-bearing <b>gearbox</b> <b>assembly.</b> Rotor loads are partially transmitted to the gearbox and may reduce gearbox reliability. In the ALSTOM PURE TORQUE concept, the rotor is supported by a cast frame running through the hub, which transfers bending loads directly to the tower. Torque is transmitted to the shaft through an elastic coupling at the front of the hub. According to Alstom, this system will increase wind turbine reliability and reduce operation and maintenance costs by isolating the gearbox from rotor loads. Gearbox reliability has challenged the wind energy industry for more than two decades. Gearbox failures require expensive and time-consuming replacement, significantly increasing the cost of wind plant operation while reducing the plant's power output and revenue. To solve gearbox reliability issues, NREL launched a Gearbox Reliability Collaborative (GRC) in 2006 and brought together the world's leading turbine manufacturers, consultants, and experts from more than 30 companies and organizations. GRC's goal was to validate the typical design process-from wind turbine system loads to bearing ratings-through a comprehensive dynamometer and field-test program. Design analyses will form a basis for improving reliability of future designs and retrofit packages. Through its study of Alstom's Eco 100 gearbox, NREL can compare its GRC model gearbox with Alstom's and add the results to the GRC database, which is helping to advance more reliable wind turbine technology...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} reveal and {{investigate}} important drivetrain dynamics {{in relation to}} offshore wind turbines. Emphasis is placed on drivetrains of the spar-type floating wind turbines (FWTs). FWTs are proposed {{to be used for}} offshore wind power extraction at the deeper-water sites where fixed foundations are economically infeasible. The FWT is a complex machine that is subjected to tough offshore environmental conditions and access for maintenance, repair and overhaul is limited and expensive. It is therefore important to understand the FWT drivetrain because gearbox failures have consistently plagued the wind energy industry and {{have not been able to}} reach the 20 year design life. Moreover, gearbox failures often result in massive downtime. Some industry players have even labelled the gearbox as the ’missing link’. There is a need for new insight into the understanding of drivetrain dynamics from an offshore perspective in order to improve its design and better predict its life. The findings in this thesis contribute to the de-risking process of offshore wind. The drivetrain and wind turbine from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s (NREL’s) Gearbox Reliability Collaborative (GRC) project are used as the case studies. There are three main topics in this thesis. In the first topic, the modelling of the planet carrier is investigated in detail. The study is performed in two parts. First, the influence of subcomponents mated to the planet carrier in the <b>gearbox</b> <b>assembly</b> is investigated in detail. These components consist of the planet pins, bearings and the main shaft. In the second part of the study, the flexible body modelling of the planet carrier for use in multi-body simulations is examined through the use of condensed finite element and multi-body simulation models. The second topic is the collaborative work with NREL which compared the multi-body models with the measurements taken from the GRC test campaigns. Data from the planetary stage is used to evaluate the accuracy and computation time of numerical models of the gearbox. A set of models that represent different levels of fidelity are established and compared to the measurement test results. The last topic, which is also the main topic, deals with the modelling and analysis of the FWT drivetrain. Various spar platforms with different drafts in the spar buoys and mooring line designs for the GRC wind turbine are specially designed for this purpose. A decoupled solution is used, i. e., the drivetrain is assumed to have no feedback on the rotor. Global aero-hydro-elastic-servo simulations are performed and the main shaft loads, generator speed and nacelle motions are calculated. These are used as inputs to a multi-body drivetrain model. Comparisons of the FWT and the land-based wind turbine (WT) are performed. Detailed sensitivity studies of the influences of the design parameters on the drivetrain loads and other wind turbine component loads are also performed.
