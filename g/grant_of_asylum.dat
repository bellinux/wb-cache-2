2500|$|The {{applicant}} has {{the burden}} of proving that he (or she) is eligible for asylum. To satisfy this burden, an applicant must show {{that she has a}} well-founded fear of persecution in her home country on account of either race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group. [...] The applicant can demonstrate her well-founded fear by demonstrating that she has a subjective fear (or apprehension) of future persecution in her home country that is objectively reasonable. [...] An applicant's claim for asylum is stronger where she can show past persecution, in which case she will receive a presumption that she has a well-founded fear of persecution in her home country. The government can rebut this presumption by demonstrating either that the applicant can relocate to another area within her home country in order to avoid persecution, or that conditions in the applicant's home country have changed such that the applicant's fear of persecution there is no longer objectively reasonable. Technically, an asylum applicant who has suffered past persecution meets the statutory criteria to receive a <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>asylum</b> even if the applicant does not fear future persecution. In practice, adjudicators will typically deny asylum status in the exercise of discretion in such cases, except where the past persecution was so severe as to warrant a humanitarian <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>asylum,</b> or where the applicant would face other serious harm if returned to his or her country of origin. In addition, applicants who, according to the US Government, participated in the persecution of others are not eligible for asylum.|$|E

5000|$|In 1980, Congress finally {{conformed}} U.S. {{statutory law}} to the U.N. protocol.

Other statutes dealing with the discretionary <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>asylum</b> referred to the well-founded-fear standard; the statutes dealing with withholding of deportation, by contrast, did not. The Court thus {{concluded that there was}} some higher standard required for the alien to receive the mandatory relief of withholding of removal.

40|$|The {{principle}} {{of due process}} requires that reasons be given for rejecting a non-national's request for asylum. One measure to achieve a faster, more efficient, {{and at the same}} time more uniform output of asylum decisions in Switzerland has been the introduction of so-called Textbausteine, standardized and computer-stored paragraphs, or textual elements, which can be combined with phrases and paragraphs drafted with specific reference to the individual case in negative decisions. Many such standardized paragraphs simply quote legal provisions, or contain introductory or closing phrases and sections common to many decisions. This article looks at those textual elements that do pose serious problem, in particular where they construe legal terms and provisions, and/or apply them to common factual situations. It is suggested that they are not just a helpful device to facilitate the drafting of negative decisions; any collection of standardized textual elements has to be well-balanced and complete, in order to be acceptable. This means that examples of positive criteria, sufficient for the <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>asylum,</b> must be included, as well as negative example...|$|E

40|$|Having {{left their}} home country, 18 million {{refugees}} and other protection seekers cannot exert {{their rights to}} democratic participation. As a consequence, they are deprived of all influence on a legal instrument of existential importance for them, namely the <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>asylum.</b> Can the exclusion of refugees from the framing of aliens legislation be justified?The analysis carried out in this text proceeds in three steps: First, an empirical exploration of international law reveals a tendency towards the emergence of universal implementation of the ideal of democracy. However, this tendency is clearly limited by the concept of citizenship as the crucial link between actor and political structure. The following inquiry into the conceptual roots of democracy and sovereignty identifies the theoretical foundation for the tendency towards universal implementation. Simultaneously, it emerges that insistence on a particularistic sovereignty concept solely professing national interest is logically incompatible with the rationale behind democratic statehood: to realise individual autonomy. Shifting perspective in the last approach, {{the possibility of a}} nexus between exclusionary norm creation and disrespect for refugee and immigration law is established by means of contemporary legitimacy theory...|$|E
40|$|Refugees {{increasingly}} encounter {{laws and}} policies which provide that their protection needs {{will be considered}} or addressed somewhere other than in {{the territory of the}} state where they have sought, or intend to seek, protection. Such policies-including 2 ̆ 2 country of first arrival, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 safe third country, 2 ̆ 2 and extraterritorial processing rules and practices-raise both opportunities and challenges for international refugee law.

30|$|Let us {{turn to the}} time-series {{cross-section}} analysis first. As was explained above, the dependent variable is the estimated number of protestors as reported in Monday newspapers. In order to measure the preconditions of migrant protest, i.e. war or discrimination in the sending state, we include the number <b>of</b> <b>asylum</b> seekers as an independent variable. This is a good indicator because war or discrimination in the sending state is a formal condition for the <b>granting</b> <b>of</b> <b>asylum</b> status. Also war and discrimination are strong predictors for the flows <b>of</b> <b>asylum</b> seekers (Neumayer, 2005). Finally, for the time-series analysis the number <b>of</b> <b>asylum</b> seekers is the best available indicator {{for the number of}} immigrants that migrated due to political reasons.

40|$|The right <b>of</b> <b>asylum</b> {{is rooted}} in the history of mankind (religious right <b>of</b> <b>asylum</b> (sanctuary)) and since the {{beginning}} of the modern State it has been rooted in the sovereignty of the State itself (the right <b>of</b> territorial <b>asylum).</b> The State retains the right to grant its protection to certain non-nationals or stateless persons, as a consequence of its territorial sovereignty, once the conditions laid down by the State have been complied with. In principle, it is the sovereign State itself which decides in which circumstances a person deserves such protection. 1 Refugee status, on the other hand, is a concept which arose in international law in the 20 th century and is defined through international agreements. It protects certain persons, especially when they have had to flee from the countries of their nationality or their habitual residence owing to a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons which concern their race, nationality, membership in a particular social group or their political opinions. 2 Despite the underlying humanitarian principles, there is no doubt that the <b>granting</b> <b>of</b> <b>asylum</b> is intimately connected with politics at all levels. 3 Therefore the term political asylum is also used. As far as refugee status is concerned, the treaty instruments are the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (further referred to as the 1951 Geneva Convention) 4 and the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees (further referred to as the 1967 New York Protocol). 5 Although there are references to asylum in the Preamble to the 1951 Geneva Convention, the <b>granting</b> <b>of</b> <b>asylum</b> (i. e. <b>granting</b> <b>of</b> full and lasting protection) is not dealt with further in the text of this convention or the 1967 New York Protocol. 6 The 1951 Geneva Convention was originally drafted to deal with the displacement of people as a result of the Second World War. It restricted the definition of refugees to those whose fear of persecution arose from events occurring in Europe before 1 January 1951. The 1967 New York Protocol removed the time restriction and promoted a gradual removal of the geographical restriction. However, the definition of refugee was not changed...|$|R
