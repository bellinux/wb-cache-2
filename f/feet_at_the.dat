5|$|The video {{begins with}} shots of several skyscrapers in New York, which are {{followed}} by scenes of the band performing in a warehouse that has {{been converted into a}} stage (similar to Vino's bar which is where the band used to regularly perform before they became popular). The crowd at the concert is seen singing along with the band. The video continually cuts the singer walking through Brooklyn in a dark dress and makeup. She walks through a train station, streets and the Brooklyn Bridge. During the bridge of the song, Lee runs through the Brooklyn Bridge and jumps on the other side, landing on her <b>feet.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> end of the video, the band meet up and walk to the beach where they walk into the sea. The final shot shows the band walking in the sea as the video fades out.|$|E

25|$|To {{attempt to}} reduce {{the effect of the}} Bushes Wind, the course was narrowed and pushed further to the centre of the river. The width was 135 feet in 1887, in 120 feet in 1888 and then {{progressively}} until by 1914 it was down to 100 <b>feet</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> start tapering to 80 <b>feet</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> finish. In 1899, floating booms secured between the pilings which mark the course were also introduced along part of its length in an attempt to keep spectators from obstructing races.|$|E
25|$|Faldo won {{his second}} major {{championship}} at the 1989 Masters. Starting his fourth round five shots off the lead held by Ben Crenshaw, Faldo's {{final round of}} 65 (consisting of eight birdies, nine pars and one bogey) was the low round of the tournament and enabled him {{to get into a}} playoff with Scott Hoch. Displaying some brilliant putting in his final round, Faldo holed a 50-foot birdie putt on the first hole and followed this up with birdies on the 2nd, 4th and 7th holes. On the back nine, Faldo holed birdie putts of 12 <b>feet</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 13th, 5 <b>feet</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 14th, 15 feet (with an 8-foot break) at the 16th, and 30 <b>feet</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 17th. On the first hole of the ensuing sudden-death playoff, Hoch missed a 2-foot par putt that would have won him the tournament. On the 2nd playoff hole, amid the growing evening darkness, Faldo holed a 25-foot birdie putt to win the tournament.|$|E

Breaching of the sandbar during late fall/early winter splits the beach in two sections. The northern section is protected by the Russian River flowing into the ocean and creates an ideal location for harbor seal pupping.|$|E

25|$|Tropical Storm Doria in 1971 and Hurricane Floyd in September 1999 brought record floods to {{the areas}} {{adjacent}} to the Millstone River, which is located along one edge of the Zarephath campus. Despite maintaining a twelve-foot-high flood levee, Zarephath was inundated with water from the nearby river and Delaware and Raritan canal. In 1999 the flood crest was a record one, over three feet higher than the previously recorded crest in the river basin. The water level in the Zarephath compound was seven <b>feet</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> height of the flood. The church's damage from Floyd was estimated at $2.5 million.|$|E

25|$|On June 17, 1965, {{fifty years}} before the 2015 flood, a similar flash flood had {{occurred}} at Philmont Scout Ranch. The 1965 flood, with water levels of up to 12.42 <b>feet</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> highest, was the largest recorded flood {{in the history of}} Philmont until the 2015 flood, with water levels in some areas higher than 20 feet. Both of these floods likely occurred due to El Niño seasons. However, the two floods had geographical differences, as Rayado Canyon and the Cimarron River had overflowed in 1965, and tributaries of Ponil Creek had overflowed in 2015.|$|E
25|$|More than 35 {{percent of}} the {{electric}} power generated in Iowa now comes from wind power. Iowa had over 6900 megawatts (MW) of generation capacity {{at the end of}} 2016. Electrical energy generated in Iowa by wind in 2014 amounted to over 16 million Megawatt-hours. Since Iowa adopted a renewable energy standard in 1983, the wind power industry has generated over $10 billion in investment. The second concrete wind turbine tower to be built in the U.S., and also the country's tallest (377 <b>feet)</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time built, is in Adams county. The tower was completed in the spring of 2016.|$|E
25|$|Shenandoah was {{powered by}} , eight-cylinder Packard {{gasoline}} engines. Six engines were originally installed, but in 1924 one engine (aft {{of the control}} car) was removed. The first frame of Shenandoah was erected by 24 June 1922; on 20 August 1923, the completed airship was floated free of the ground. Helium cost $55 per thousand cubic <b>feet</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, and was considered too expensive to simply vent to the atmosphere {{to compensate for the}} weight of fuel consumed by the gasoline engines. Neutral buoyancy was preserved by installing condensers to capture the water vapor in the engine exhaust.|$|E

Because the IBF did not consider Ferguson to be a legitimate contender, they would not sanction the defense for Bowe and only the WBA and lineal championships were on the line. Ferguson thought he had a legitimate chance to knock the champion out, but Bowe disregarded his boasts. Ferguson was knocked down toward the end of the first round and barely made it back to his <b>feet</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bell, then was dropped again as the second round began and knocked out.|$|E
25|$|Alice courageously {{faces the}} shame of bearing and rearing their illegitimate {{daughter}} Anna alone. This ordeal is the test of the title—of herself, her family, and her community. Her story is paralleled in a subplot involving Sallie, a sinner of a lower sort. Over the years Alice is supported by some, notably the senator, but vilified {{by most of the}} small-minded townsfolk, including her own mother. Her sister Gertrude, engaged to the priggish clergyman John Prescott, also suffers, her intended suddenly developing cold <b>feet</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> news of Alice's indiscretion. Perhaps the height of Alice's suffering is reached when Harriet, having lost her own child, importunes her to let her have Anna instead; persuaded {{it would be in the}} best interest of her daughter, Alice finally complies.|$|E
25|$|With its tall brick facade and towering bell tower, St. Peter's Church is {{the single}} largest and most {{distinctive}} building in Old Jaffa. The interior {{of the church is}} reminiscent of cathedrals in Europe, with a high vaulted ceiling, stained glass, and marble walls. The stained glass was manufactured in Munich by renowned artist Franz Xaver Zettler. The four panels in the interior of the church depict episodes from the life of St. Peter, including the miraculous catch of fishes, the giving of the keys, the transfiguration of Jesus on Mount Tabor and the washing of the <b>feet</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Last Supper. With the exception of depictions of Tabitha, Francis of Assisi, and the Immaculate Conception, all of the other windows in the church depict Spanish saints, which is unsurprising since the present building was erected by the Spanish Empire. Also of note is the pulpit which is carved {{in the shape of a}} lifelike tree.|$|E
