50|$|Through {{the use of}} a <b>DC-DC</b> <b>converter,</b> higher DC {{voltages}} such as 48 V to 72 V DC can be {{stepped down}} to 36 V, 24 V, 18 V, 12 V, or 5 V to supply different loads. In a telecommunications system operating at 48 V DC, it is generally more efficient to step voltage down to 12 V to 24 V DC with a <b>DC-DC</b> <b>converter</b> and power equipment loads directly at their native DC input voltages, versus operating a 48 V DC to 120 V AC inverter to provide power to equipment.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, coupled {{inductors}} {{have been}} applied to multiphase <b>DC-DC</b> <b>converters.</b> Detailed analysis {{has been done to}} investigate the benefits of directly coupled inductors and inversely coupled inductors, compared to conventional uncoupled inductors. In general, coupled inductors for multiphase <b>DC-DC</b> <b>converters</b> have inherent benefits such as excellent current sharing characteristics, immunity to component tolerance and reduction in current control complexity. Specifically, by employing directly coupled inductors for multiphase <b>DC-DC</b> <b>converters,</b> overall current ripple can be effectively reduced, compared to that of uncoupled inductors. For inversely coupled inductors, phase current ripple can be reduced if operating points and coupling coefficients are carefully chosen. As for small-signal characteristics, inversely coupled inductors have the advantages of broadening the bandwidth of multiphase <b>DC-DC</b> <b>converters</b> and being more immune to load variation at low frequencies. On the other hand, directly coupled inductors have the benefit of low sensitivity to input variation at high frequencies. In addition, the proposed new structure for multiphase <b>DC-DC</b> <b>converters</b> has excellent current sharing performance and reduced current ripple. Computer simulations have been done and hardware prototypes have been built to validate the concepts...|$|R

30|$|Energy storage systems (ESS) with {{bidirectional}} <b>DC-DC</b> <b>converters</b> {{are essential}} in renewable energy based micro-grids, electric vehicles (EVs), transportations, et al [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Bidirectional <b>DC-DC</b> <b>converters</b> {{play the role}} of converting and transferring the electrical energy of the storage elements, which conduct both charge and discharge operation. As a result, the bidirectional <b>DC-DC</b> <b>converters</b> are the key interfaces for efficient energy management. Generally, the voltage of the storage elements is relatively low due to safety issues. Meanwhile, the bus voltage of the DC-based micro-grid, electric EVs and plug-in hybrid EVs (PHEVs) is relatively high in order to improve the system power level. Consequently, a step-up and step-down bidirectional converter is required to link the low voltage storage elements and high voltage bus. How to derive high efficiency <b>DC-DC</b> <b>converters</b> with large conversion ratio is still challengeable in the power electronics community.|$|R
50|$|A system {{developed}} at Swinburne University of Technology used DC electromagnetic machines as damping elements to generate energy for storage in conventional batteries. This system utilized a device based on similar principals to a 'step-up' (boost) <b>DC-DC</b> <b>converter.</b> The design offered {{the ability to}} optimize the energy conversion efficiency {{of the system and}} also allow the ability to control the damping coefficient of the damper, such that the system could act as a semi-active damper.|$|E
50|$|However, the {{batteries}} {{have a fairly}} constant voltage, which also has a rather different value {{than that of the}} solar cells. So a voltage transformation is needed. A special type of <b>DC-DC</b> <b>converter</b> is used to ensure the load resistance presented to the solar cells is such that the solar cells give maximum power, so also {{at the top of the}} green line in the graph. This is called a Maximum power point tracker (MPPT). Here too, the goal is to have this conversion achieve maximum efficiency (>97%).|$|E
50|$|Some boards {{have built}} in DC-DC {{converters}} and converters {{have also been}} made to plug directly into the ATX connector (e.g. the PicoPSU), either of these options avoids the need to mount a separate <b>DC-DC</b> <b>converter</b> into the case, saving space and design effort. Boards using full-power Intel or AMD CPUs typically use ATX12V 2.x connections and require a case with appropriate power supply and cooling for these more power-hungry chips. Defined by the ATX specification, power supplies with ATX12V connector on a separate 12 volts rail must not idle that 12 volts rail.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Many {{applications}} {{call for}} high step-up <b>dc–dc</b> <b>converters</b> {{that do not}} require isolation. Some <b>dc–dc</b> <b>converters</b> can provide high step-up voltage gain, but with the penalty of either an extreme duty ratio or a large amount of circulating energy. <b>DC–DC</b> <b>converters</b> with coupled inductors can provide high voltage gain, but their efficiency is degraded by the losses associated with leakage inductors. Converters with active clamps recycle the leakage energy at the price of increasing topology com-plexity. A family of high-efficiency, high step-up <b>dc–dc</b> <b>converters</b> with simple topologies is proposed in this paper. The proposed converters, which use diodes and coupled windings instead of active switches to realize functions similar to those of active clamps, perform better than their active-clamp counterparts. High efficiency is achieved because the leakage energy is recycled and the output rectifier reverse-recovery problem is alleviated.

Because the voltage of the battery {{is proportional to the}} number of cells used the battery can therefore act as a very powerful <b>DC-DC</b> <b>converter.</b> In addition, if the number of cells is continuously changed (on the input and/or output side) power conversion can also be AC/DC, AC/AC, or DC-AC with the frequency limited by that of the switching gear.|$|E
50|$|The WM-DD2 was {{introduced}} in 1984, {{and appeared to be}} a WM-DD that was available in same colors and had the addition of Dolby B noise reduction. In marketing terms this is exactly what it was, though technically the change was far from trivial. The innovation that made this change possible was the introduction of miniature Dolby ICs that could run directly from the 3V battery supply without the need for a <b>DC-DC</b> <b>converter</b> (as had had to be employed in the WM-7, for example). Even with these devices the changes made between the WM-DD and the WM-DD2 were far reaching and only possible because the printed circuit board was made with track work on both sides.|$|E
