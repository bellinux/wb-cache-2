5|$|In February 2010, Pacific Hydro {{opened the}} 56.7 MW Clements Gap Wind Farm. The wind farm {{is located in}} South Australia’s mid-north. The project has 27 x 2.1 MW Suzlon wind turbines, which <b>generate</b> <b>enough</b> {{electricity}} for 30,000 homes.|$|E
5|$|In 2010 it was {{announced}} that 10 Hammerfest Strom HS1000 Norwegian turbines, capable of generating 1 MW each, could be installed in the Sound of Islay and that the BiFab yard at Arnish had won a £2 million contract to build some of the structures' components. The following March this project, which will become the largest tidal array in the world, was approved by the Scottish Government with 10 planned tidal turbines predicted to <b>generate</b> <b>enough</b> power for over 5,000 homes. The Sound of Islay offers both high currents and shelter from storms. A single 1 MW HS1000 was installed at EMEC off Eday, Orkney by the end of 2011.|$|E
5|$|In March 2011, the Park Service {{installed}} two webcams at the Sheep Rock Unit. Both transmit continuous real-time images; one {{shows the}} paleontology {{lab at the}} Condon Center and the other depicts Sheep Rock and nearby features. In June 2011, work was finished on a new ranger residence in the Painted Hills Unit that makes the unit almost carbon-neutral. Solar panels <b>generate</b> <b>enough</b> electricity to power the house {{as well as the}} ranger's electric vehicle, on loan from its manufacturer for a year. The project is part of ongoing efforts to make the whole park carbon-neutral.|$|E

50|$|On November 12, 2010, EnergyUnited officially debuted a {{solar farm}} in the Taylorsville area, <b>generating</b> <b>enough</b> power for 150-200 homes. The $6 million project was a joint effort with SunEdison, but Duke Energy took over, and EnergyUnited will buy the solar power from Duke. The company also {{purchased}} electricity from a biomass plant at Iredell County's landfill which <b>generated</b> <b>enough</b> power for 3000 homes.|$|R

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, if {{the center of}} mass height is behind or below the line, such as on most tandem {{bicycles}} or long-wheel-base recumbent bicycles, as well as cars, it is less likely that the front wheel can <b>generate</b> <b>enough</b> braking force to flip the bike. This means they can decelerate up to nearly the limit of adhesion of the tires to the road, which could reach 0.8 g if the coefficient of friction is 0.8, which is 40% more than an upright bicycle under even the best conditions. Bicycling Science author David Gordon Wilson points out that this puts upright bicyclists at particular risk of causing a rear-end collision if they tailgate cars.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{powerful}} motorcycles can <b>generate</b> <b>enough</b> torque at {{the rear}} wheel to lift the front wheel off {{the ground in a}} maneuver called a wheelie. A line similar to the one described above to analyze braking performance can be drawn from the rear wheel contact patch to predict if a wheelie is possible given the available friction, the center of mass location, and sufficient power. This can also happen on bicycles, although there is much less power available, if the center of mass is back or up far enough or the rider lurches back when applying power to the pedals.|$|E
5|$|In the Fourth Test at Adelaide Lindwall {{came the}} closest to a hat-trick in his entire Test career. He {{finished}} England's innings by clean bowling three batsmen in four deliveries, with the unsuccessful ball barely missing Doug Wright's stumps to end with 4/52. Lindwall took the last four wickets in two overs, conceding two runs. He took 2/60 and scored 20 in another drawn match. Lindwall came into the final Test on his home ground in Sydney with a match haul of 10/73 in a Shield match. He continued his productive series with 7/63 in the first innings on a flat pitch, managing to <b>generate</b> <b>enough</b> pace to knock the bat out of Denis Compton's hands. Lindwall took two further wickets in the second innings as Australia took a 3–0 series win with another innings victory. Lindwall topped the bowling averages on either side with 18 wickets at 20.38, {{in addition to his}} 160 runs at 32.00.|$|E

5|$|Determined {{to prove}} that he can become a scarer, Mike breaks into the school's door lab and enters a door to the human world that leads to a summer camp, but he is unable to scare a cabin full of children, and runs off into the woods. Meanwhile, Roar Omega Roar offers to {{reinstate}} Sulley, but he refuses, instead confessing to Hardscrabble that he cheated, just as she is alerted to Mike's break-in. Realizing what happened, Sulley defies Hardscrabble, and enters the same door to find Mike. After reconciling, they try to return, but are unable to exit after Hardscrabble deactivates the door while waiting for the authorities to arrive. Pursued by camp rangers, Mike realizes {{that the only way to}} escape is to <b>generate</b> <b>enough</b> scream energy to power the door from their side. Working together, Sulley and Mike terrify the camp rangers and generate an overwhelming amount of scream energy to return to the lab seconds before the device overloads and explodes in front of Hardscrabble.|$|E
5|$|Tagliani ran {{in sixth}} gear after his team {{ordered him to}} {{conserve}} fuel {{and was unable to}} <b>generate</b> <b>enough</b> heat into his tires to challenge Andretti on the restarts. On lap 87, Fittipaldi tried an overtaking manoevure on Junqueira around the outside of turn three which resulted in Fittipaldi and Junqueira making contact and both drivers slid into the outside tire barrier. Andretti's lead of 7.4 seconds was reduced to nothing when the eleventh (and final) caution was displayed on the next lap to allow course officials to extract Fittipaldi's and Junquiera's cars from the track. Racing resumed on lap 90 with Andretti retaining the first position and pulled away {{from the rest of the}} field. Fernández's radio had malfunctioned and was in another gear in an attempt to save fuel which allowed Tagliani to pass him for second. However, Tagliani was unable to close the gap to Andretti because of the presence of Junqueira's lapped car which cost him more than two seconds. He drove on the track's dirty side on the backstraight and his tires were cleaned in the next five turns on the track.|$|E
5|$|Wood {{shoots a}} film with Lugosi outside his home. When Wood and company attend the premiere for Bride of the Monster, an angry mob chases {{them out of}} the theater. Lugosi passes away, leaving Wood without a star. Wood convinces his landlord, a church leader named Reynolds, that funding Wood's script for Grave Robbers from Outer Space would result in a box office success, and <b>generate</b> <b>enough</b> money for Reynolds' dream project. Dr. Tom Mason, O'Hara's chiropractor, is chosen to be Lugosi's {{stand-in}} for resembling Lugosi. Wood and the Baptists have conflicts over the title and content of the script which they want to have changed to Plan 9 from Outer Space, along with Ed's B movie directing style, his casting decisions and his transvestism. Wood leaves the set to go to the nearest bar, where he encounters his idol, Orson Welles. Filming for Plan 9 finishes with Ed taking action against his producers. After attending the premiere of Plan 9, Wood and O'Hara go to Las Vegas to get married.|$|E

25|$|With {{such short}} wheelbase, {{motorcycles}} can <b>generate</b> <b>enough</b> torque {{at the rear}} wheel, and enough stopping force at the front wheel, to lift the opposite wheel off the road. These actions, if performed on purpose, are known as wheelies and stoppies (or endos) respectively.|$|E
25|$|The Perth {{desalination}} plant is powered partially by renewable {{energy from the}} Emu Downs Wind Farm. A wind farm at Bungendore in New South Wales was purpose-built to <b>generate</b> <b>enough</b> renewable energy to offset the Sydney plant's energy use, mitigating concerns about harmful greenhouse gas emissions.|$|E
25|$|Short-wheelbase or tall bicycles, when braking, can <b>generate</b> <b>enough</b> {{stopping}} {{force at}} the front wheel to flip longitudinally. The act of purposefully using this force to lift the rear wheel and balance on the front without tipping over is a trick known as a stoppie, endo, or front wheelie.|$|E

50|$|The station <b>generates</b> <b>enough</b> {{electricity}} to light 17 million 100-watt bulbs. The facility {{consists of two}} steam turbines, which began commercial operation in 1970 and 1971, and two cooling towers.|$|R
25|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, several people were {{instrumental}} {{in the establishment of}} the Boston Public Library. George Ticknor, a Harvard professor and trustee of the Boston Athenaeum, raised the possibility of establishing a public library in Boston beginning as early as 1826. At the time, Ticknor could not <b>generate</b> <b>enough</b> interest.|$|E
25|$|Physiological {{dormancy}} {{means the}} embryo, due to physiological causes, cannot <b>generate</b> <b>enough</b> power {{to break through}} the seed coat, endosperm or other covering structures. Dormancy is typically broken at cool wet, warm wet or warm dry conditions. Abscisic acid is usually the growth inhibitor in seeds, and its production can be affected by light.|$|E
25|$|Metabolic {{acidosis}} (due to {{accumulation of}} sulfates, phosphates, uric acid etc.) may cause altered enzyme activity by excess acid acting on enzymes; and also increased excitability of cardiac and neuronal membranes by {{the promotion of}} hyperkalemia due to excess acid (acidemia). Acidosis is also due to decreased capacity to <b>generate</b> <b>enough</b> ammonia from {{the cells of the}} proximal tubule.|$|E
5000|$|With a {{total of}} 38 {{turbines}} on five sites, Meentycat wind farm <b>generates</b> <b>enough</b> electricity to power the equivalent of approximately 45,000 homes a year, with CO2 savings approaching 200,000 tonnes per year.|$|R

25|$|Two of Scotland's Pool C matches {{were played}} at Murrayfield Stadium in Scotland. The Scottish Rugby Union was {{reportedly}} having doubts in early 2006 about hosting these games and whether Scotland would <b>generate</b> <b>enough</b> market demand, but confirmed in April 2006 that the games would be played at Murrayfield. In the end, the Scotland v. New Zealand match failed to sell out, and the stadium {{was less than}} half-full for the Scotland v. Romania match.|$|E
25|$|When the Marshall Plan {{went into}} effect in 1947, many European {{countries}} began receiving aid from other sources. Faced with this competition, the World Bank shifted its focus to non-European countries. Until 1968, its loans were earmarked for the construction of infrastructure works, such as seaports, highway systems, and power plants, that would <b>generate</b> <b>enough</b> income to enable a borrower country to repay the loan. In 1960, the International Development Association was formed (as opposed to a UN fund named SUNFED), providing soft loans to developing countries.|$|E
25|$|Brennan Mulwray (Victor Webster) is an Elemental Electrical {{with the}} ability to <b>generate</b> <b>enough</b> {{electricity}} from his body to power a small city. He can also shoot powerful electrical bolts from his palms which, if fired downward, are capable of launching him high into the air. His primary weakness is water. Before Adam Kane found Mulwray, he was a thief. Mason Eckhart captured him and used him to hunt down the other New Mutants. However, Mulwray escaped and managed to join Mutant X along with Emma DeLauro.|$|E
