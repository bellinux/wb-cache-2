5|$|Edinburgh {{had emerged}} as the capital <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century.</b> It was the wealthiest and largest city in the kingdom and held the central law courts, {{parliament}} and royal residence at Holyrood Palace. After James VI left for London at the Union of Crowns in 1603, it continued to be the centre of government. Even after the Acts of Union in 1707 removed the parliament, it retained the exchequer and law courts.|$|E
5|$|Government {{in medieval}} Scotland, {{includes}} {{all forms of}} politics and administration of the minor kingdoms that emerged after {{the departure of the}} Romans from central and southern Britain in the fifth century, through the development and growth of the combined Scottish and Pictish kingdom of Alba into the kingdom of Scotland, until the adoption of the reforms of the Renaissance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E
5|$|One {{effect of}} Jagiello's {{measures}} {{was to be}} the advancement of Catholics in Lithuania at the expense of Orthodox elements; in 1387 and 1413, for example, Lithuanian Catholic boyars were granted special judicial and political privileges denied to the Orthodox boyars. As this process gained momentum, it was accompanied by the rise of both Rus' and Lithuanian identity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E

50|$|Archbishop of Canterbury John Morton <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century</b> {{held that}} someone living {{modestly}} must be saving money and, therefore, could afford taxes, whereas someone living extravagantly obviously was rich and, therefore, could afford taxes.|$|R
5|$|Strand Inn, {{also called}} Chester Inn, was the {{shortest}} lived of the Inns of Chancery. Founded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century</b> it was pulled {{down in the}} 1540s by Lord Somerset {{in his role as}} Lord Protector so that he could build Somerset House. The students instead went to New Inn, and Strand Inn was absorbed into that Inn. Thomas Occleve was said to have studied at Strand Inn.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century</b> {{under the}} Stewart Dynasty, despite a {{turbulent}} political history, the crown gained greater political {{control at the}} expense of independent lords and regained most of its lost territory to approximately the modern borders of the country. However, the Auld Alliance with France led to the heavy defeat of a Scottish army at the Battle of Flodden in 1513 and the death of the king James IV, which would be followed by a long minority and a period of political instability.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{written record}} of Crewkerne {{is in the}} 899 will of Alfred the Great who left it to his youngest son Aethelweard. After the Norman conquest it was held by William the Conqueror and in the Domesday Survey of 1086 {{was described as a}} royal manor. Crewkerne Castle was possibly a Norman motte castle. The town grew up in the late mediaeval period around the textile industry, its wealth preserved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century</b> Church of St Bartholomew. During the 18th and 19th centuries the main industry was cloth making, including webbing, and sails for the Royal Navy.|$|E
50|$|Beggars' badges were badges {{and other}} {{identifying}} insignia worn by beggars beginning <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century</b> <b>in</b> Great Britain and Ireland.

25|$|The first {{commercial}} knitting guilds appear in Western Europe <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century</b> (Tournai <b>in</b> 1429, Barcelona <b>in</b> 1496). <b>The</b> Guild of Saint Fiacre {{was founded in}} Paris <b>in</b> 1527 but <b>the</b> archives mention an organization (not necessarily a guild) of knitters from 1268.|$|R
500|$|Navarre's queen Catherine de Foix (...) and her co-ruling husband John III had no {{interest}} in pursuing expulsion or forced conversions.

5|$|Arable farming {{grew in the}} High Middle Ages and {{agriculture}} entered a period of relative boom between the thirteenth century and late fifteenth century. Unlike England, Scotland had no towns dating from Roman occupation. From the twelfth century there are records of burghs, chartered towns, which became major centre of crafts and trade. There are also Scottish coins, although English coinage probably remained more significant in trade, and {{until the end of}} the period barter was probably the most common form of exchange. Craft and industry remained relatively undeveloped before the end of the Middle Ages and, although there were extensive trading networks based in Scotland, while the Scots exported largely raw materials, they imported increasing quantities of luxury goods, resulting in a bullion shortage and perhaps helping to create a financial crisis <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gedi's {{participation}} in trade {{is believed to}} be the contributing factor in its founding and its later development into a city supporting an estimated population of 2,500 inhabitants at its peak. Despite the absence of historical documents specifically mentioning Gedi, it is considered to be one of the most important sites along the coast. Prior to the construction of the outer wall <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century,</b> the city initially developed in the northern section of the modern site. The adoption of Islam by the inhabitants in the twelfth century is marked by the presence of three superimposed mosques in the northern area the city, which were constructed during the twelfth to the fourteenth century. The style of architecture and the absence of minarets characteristic of all of Gedi's mosques has been used to suggest that the locals were influenced by the Ibadite denomination.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century</b> {{continental}} {{builders are}} known to have been working in Scotland. French master-mason John Morrow was employed at the building of Glasgow Cathedral and the rebuilding of Melrose Abbey, both considered fine examples of Gothic architecture. Compared with after the Reformation, the interiors of churches were often elaborate, with highly decorated sacrament houses, like the ones surviving at Deskford and Kinkell. The carvings at Rosslyn Chapel, depicting the progression of the seven deadly sins, were created in the mid-fifteenth century. They are considered some of the finest in the Gothic style. Late Medieval Scottish churches also often contained elaborate burial monuments, like the Douglas tombs in the town of Douglas.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages the {{problems}} of schism in the Catholic Church allowed the Scottish Crown to gain greater influence over senior appointments and two archbishoprics had been established {{by the end of}} the fifteenth century. Historians have discerned a decline in traditional monastic life in the late Middle Ages, but the mendicant orders of friars grew, particularly in the expanding burghs, emphasised preaching and ministering to the population. New saints and cults of devotion also proliferated. Despite problems over the number and quality of clergy after the Black Death in the fourteenth century, and evidence of heresy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century,</b> the Church in Scotland remained stable before the Reformation in the sixteenth century.|$|E
5|$|In {{the thirteenth}} century, {{the east end}} of Elgin Cathedral {{incorporated}} typical European Gothic mouldings and tracery. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century</b> continental builders are known to have been working in Scotland. French master-mason John Morrow was employed at the building of Glasgow Cathedral and the rebuilding of Melrose Abbey, both considered fine examples of Gothic architecture. The interiors of churches were often elaborate before the Reformation, with highly decorated sacrament houses, like the ones surviving at Deskford and Kinkell.

Late Medieval Scottish churches also often contained elaborate burial monuments, like the Douglas tombs in the town of Douglas.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Æthelberht's life or reign, as very few East Anglian records have survived from this period. Mediaeval chroniclers have {{provided}} dubious accounts of his life, {{in the absence of}} any real details. According to Richard of Cirencester, writing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century,</b> Æthelberht's parents were Æthelred I of East Anglia and Leofrana of Mercia. Richard narrates in detail a story of Æthelberht's piety, election as king and wise rule. Urged to marry against his will, he apparently agreed to wed Eadburh, the daughter of Offa of Mercia, and set out to visit her, despite his mother's forebodings and his experiences of terrifying events (an earthquake, a solar eclipse and a vision).|$|E

25|$|Ferrara, {{under the}} Este, was {{expanded}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century,</b> with several new palaces being built {{such as the}} Palazzo dei Diamanti and Palazzo Schifanoia for Borso d'Este. <b>In</b> Milan, under <b>the</b> Visconti, the Certosa di Pavia was completed, and then later under the Sforza, the Castello Sforzesco was built.|$|R
5|$|The Renaissance in Scotland was a cultural, {{intellectual}} and artistic movement in Scotland, {{from the late}} fifteenth century {{to the beginning of}} the seventeenth century. It is associated with the pan-European Renaissance that is usually regarded as beginning in Italy in the late fourteenth century and reaching northern Europe as a Northern Renaissance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century.</b> It involved an attempt to revive the principles of the classical era, including humanism, a spirit of scholarly enquiry, scepticism, and concepts of balance and proportion. Since the twentieth century the uniqueness and unity of the Renaissance has been challenged by historians, but significant changes in Scotland can be seen to have taken place in education, intellectual life, literature, art, architecture, music and politics.|$|E
5|$|Unlike England, Scotland had no towns {{dating from}} Roman occupation. From {{the twelfth century}} there are records of burghs, {{chartered}} towns, which became major centres of crafts and trade. and {{there is evidence of}} 55 burghs by 1296. There are also Scottish coins, although English coinage probably remained more significant in trade and {{until the end of the}} period barter was probably the most common form of exchange.

5|$|A {{major source}} of income was the export of wool. However, the fourteenth century saw a change in fortunes: the Black Death, a {{worsening}} economic climate and poor administration left the abbey (like many others of its order) with sharply declining numbers of monks and saddled with major debt. The internal discipline and morals of the community declined too: in 1400–01 it was reported to the government that the abbot of Cleeve and three other monks were leading a group of 200 bandits and attacking travellers in the region. However, things improved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century</b> and despite the vast expense caused by the extravagant building projects of the last abbots, better management, access to new resources (for instance from the profits from the right to hold markets granted by the crown) and a general improvement in the circumstances facing the house meant that {{just prior to the}} dissolution Cleeve was enjoying an Indian Summer of comfortable stability.|$|E
50|$|Although the Three Castles briefly saw action {{during the}} {{rebellion}} of Owain Glyndŵr in 1404-05, they never again {{played a major}} role in military affairs.

5|$|As no {{description}} of the frieze survives from antiquity and many religious rituals involved secret symbolism and traditions left unspoken, so {{the question of the}} meaning of the sculpture has been a persistent and unresolved one. The first published attempt at interpretation belongs to Cyriac of Ancona <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century</b> AD who referred to it as the “victories of Athens in the time of Pericles”. What is now the more accepted view of the piece, however, namely that it depicts the Greater Panathenaic procession from the Leokoreion by the Dipylon gate, to the Acropolis, was mooted by Stuart and Revett in the second volume of their Antiquities of Athens, 1787. Subsequent interpretations have built largely on this theory, even if they disallow that a temple sculpture could represent a contemporary event rather than a mythological or historical one. It has only been in recent years that an alternative thesis in which the frieze depicts the founding myth of the city of Athens instead of the festival pompe has emerged.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of this period the boundaries of Alba contained only a small proportion of modern Scotland. Even when these lands were added to in the tenth and eleventh centuries, the term Scotia was applied in sources only to the region between the River Forth, the central Grampians and the River Spey and only began to be used to describe all of the lands under the authority of the Scottish crown from {{the second half of the}} twelfth century. By the late thirteenth century when the Treaty of York (1237) and Treaty of Perth (1266) had fixed the boundaries with the Kingdom of the Scots with England and Norway respectively, its borders were close to the modern boundaries. After this time both Berwick and the Isle of Man were lost to England, and Orkney and Shetland were gained from Norway <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century.</b>|$|E
5|$|From {{the end of}} the {{eleventh}} century universities had been founded across Europe, developing as semi-autonomous centres of learning, often teaching theology, mathematics, law and medicine. By the fifteenth century, beginning in northern Italy, universities had become strongly influenced by Humanist thinking. This put an emphasis on classical authors, questioned some of the accepted certainties of established thinking and manifested itself in the teaching of new subjects, particularly through the medium of the Greek language. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>fifteenth</b> <b>century</b> university colleges had been founded at St John's College, St Andrews (1418) and St Salvator's College was added in 1450. Glasgow was founded in 1451 and King's College, Aberdeen in 1495. St Leonard's College was added at St. Andrews in 1511. Initially, they were designed for the training of clerics, but they would increasingly be used by laymen who began to challenge the clerical monopoly of administrative posts in government and law.|$|E
