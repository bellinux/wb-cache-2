The hard part is manipulating the story and accenting the characters. In the beginning, when Todd is laying down the rules, there's a certain repetitive thematic idea you <b>hear.</b> <b>You</b> hear the same music when Dussander is turning the tables on Todd, which makes you remember the first scene... You hope people are subliminally making the connection that the tables are turning back and forth.|$|E

25|$|In a dark, private lair in a tower {{high above}} the park, the Phantom (now {{revealed}} as Phantasma's owner and mastermind) interacts with an automaton that resembles Christine ("The Aerie"). In spite of the years that have passed and his many successes, the Phantom still longs {{to be reunited with}} her ("Til I <b>Hear</b> <b>You</b> Sing"). Meg intrudes and presses the Phantom for feedback on her performance, but he is distracted by his thoughts of Christine and dismisses Meg as an annoyance. Madame Giry is irritated that the Phantom still seems to think only of Christine after all that she and Meg have done for him over the years. Giry recounts how she and Meg helped smuggle him out of Paris and to a ship departing from Calais, on which they escaped to America. Ignoring her, the Phantom summons Miss Fleck, who appears with two other freak show performers, Dr. Gangle and Mr. Squelch. The Phantom has them dispatch a letter to Christine, inviting her to come and perform at Phantasma ("Giry confronts The Phantom/Til' I <b>Hear</b> <b>You</b> Sing (Reprise)").|$|E

500|$|The first aria, [...] "" [...] (Mark and <b>hear,</b> <b>you</b> humans), is {{accompanied}} by the continuo alone.

500|$|... "I <b>Hear</b> <b>You,</b> I See You" [...] was {{directed}} by Lawrence Trilling and written by Jason Katims, one of the executive directors of Parenthood. It marked the first appearance of William Baldwin, who is set to appear in at least eight episodes {{in the first half}} of the second season in his recurring role as Gordon Flint. Trilling said the characters will serve not only as Adam's boss, but also an eventual love interest for Sarah, so they wanted an actor with both stature and comedic talent. Baldwin previously starred in the drama television series Dirty Sexy Money along with Parenthood co-star Peter Krause, and Trilling felt their past experience working together helped Krause and Baldwin develop a quick rapport on Parenthood. [...] "I <b>Hear</b> <b>You,</b> I See You" [...] also included the return of Minka Kelly, who previously appeared in first season episodes as Gaby, Max's therapist.|$|E
