5000|$|On 25 October 1958 Herbert J. Thomas {{deployed}} {{again with}} other {{units of the}} 7th Fleet to the Far East, serving with pride as a good-will ambassador for the United States. She trained with Japanese destroyers in antisubmarine exercises and operated again with fast carrier groups. On 4 July 1959 the Herbert J. Thomas represented the United States Navy by firing a twenty-one-gun salute at the Alaska statehood ceremony in Sitka. Upon entry to the harbor, the Thomas dropped anchor in waters at least one fathom greater than the length of its anchor chain. And, due to a <b>hang-fire,</b> the ship actually gave Alaska a twenty-two-gun salute. The ship deployed regularly to the Far East until 9 July 1963 when she entered Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Vallejo, California and remained in commission in reserve for a 12½-month modernization overhaul. During the FRAM I conversion, the destroyer received an entirely new superstructure [...] - [...] {{designed to protect the}} ship against biological and chemical agents as well as radioactive fallout [...] - [...] and the Antisubmarine Rocket (ASROC) system.|$|E
50|$|Operation of the Model 811 is by an {{external}} electric motor that drives a camshaft lying inside the receiver. This shaft has a spiral cam groove that engages with a lug on the bolt, so {{that as the}} shaft revolves, the bolt is moved back and forth. The shaft is also geared to the feed mechanism, so that feed is in strict synchronisation with the bolt's movements. A <b>hang-fire</b> safety device is provided. Fire modes are single shot, limited bursts or continuous bursts with a pre-selectable cyclic rate of fire at 125 or 400 rounds/min. The feed direction for the percussion-primed 25 × 137 ammunition can be either manually selected or remotely selected, through an electrical feeder selection device. The first round fired following selection comes from the belt that has just been selected. The external power feature {{can be used for}} maintenance and training using dummy rounds. The Model 811 can fire all NATO standard 25 × 137 ammunition. Current natures available from Nexter Munitions includes the following; High Explosive Incendiary Tracer (HEI-T), Target Practice (TP), Target Practice Tracer (TP-T), Armour-Piercing Discarding-Sabot Tracer (APDS-T) and Armour-Piercing Fin-Stabilised Discarding-Sabot Tracer (APFSDS-T). According to Nexter Systems, the accuracy of the Model 811 25 mm is such that all rounds fired will hit a 1.5 m diameter target at a range of 1,500 m.|$|E
50|$|All {{smokeless}} powders {{are somewhat}} difficult to ignite in a gun, {{so that in}} order to prevent <b>hang-fires</b> every cartridge has a primer or igniter, of ordinary fine grain gunpowder, placed so as to intercept the flash from the tube; the outside of the bag containing this igniter is made of shalloon, to allow the flash to penetrate with ease. The charge for heavy guns i.e. above 6 inches (150 mm), is made up in separate cartridges containing half or quarter charges, both for convenience of handling, and to allow a reduced charge to be used.|$|R
5000|$|Malfunctions {{associated}} with the firing pin of a firearm, or with the primer and/or powder within a cartridge include failures to discharge (misfires, [...] "duds"), delayed discharge (<b>hang-fires),</b> and incomplete or insufficient discharge (squibs). A misfire is when the cartridge does not fire after it is struck by the firing pin. A hangfire is when the firing pin strikes the cartridge, {{but there is a}} delay of some seconds before the cartridge finally fires. A squib is when an underpowered round is fired, perhaps with an insufficient amount of powder in the case, and the bullet lodges in the bore. If the firearm is fired again, the barrel can peel back, severely damaging the weapon and injuring the shooter.|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{development}} of solid rocket motor (SRM) need to predict the internal gas-dynamic phenomena that happen during the SRM operative life. The operative life of a SRM can be divided in a sequence of different phases: the first phase is the ignition transient during which the solid propellant is ignited; the second phase is the quasi-steady phase during which the SRM reaches the design operative conditions; finally there is the combustion-tail during which the combustion of solid propellant extinguishes. The phenomena happening during ignition transient are often more critical than those occurring in the subsequent phases; within {{a fraction of a}} second hot igniter gases flow in the combustion chamber reaching supersonic conditions; pressure jumps of tenths of atmospheres and temperature peaks of thousands of Kelvin degrees can occur. The ignition transient unsteady behaviour can cause net thrust and pressure transients, over-pressure peaks, <b>hang-fires</b> or misfires, propellant grain stresses, dynamic loads on the launch vehicle (and on its payload) and on the ground segment etc [...] . All the above phenomena can compromise the performances of the SRM and often the successful of the launch. The study of the SRM ignition transient is the research background of this Ph. D. dissertation. It is common and well confirmed practice in industry to analyze ignition transient using zero-dimensional, volume-filling or one-dimensional physical models, and only recently two-dimensional approaches can be found. Presently the increasing of the computational capabilities allows to a fully three-dimensional study. The reasons to develop a three-dimensional model are numerous: first of all the combustion chamber of a common SRM has often a three-dimensional geometry; second the igniter nozzles has a three-dimensional configuration with both axial and radial nozzles. Therefore the gas-dynamic phenomena generated by the igniter jets have strong three-dimensional behaviour that is impossible to study by means of a non fully three-dimensional model. The aim of this research is to present and provide suitable three-dimensional model and numerical tools able to describe the SRM ignition transient with particular interest to study the gasdynamical aspects of SRM ignition transient...|$|R

The report of this action, is submitted herewith in accordance with references (c) and (d). All times given are local, minus eleven zone time.2) In accordance with reference (a) and (b) Task Group 38.4 (Captain Rodger F. Simpson, U.S.N., Commander Destroyer Squadron TWELVE) composed of the U.S.S. FARENHOLT (CDS-12), U.S.S. BUCHANAN, U.S.S. LANSDOWNE (CDD-24), and U.S.S. LARDNER was directed to proceed from vicinity of Hathorn Sound, British Solomon Islands on the 17th of February 1944 in time to pass through a point 15 miles due west of Lat. 6°-28' Long. 154°-26' (Point Scrappy) at 1600, proceed at high speed to a point Lat. 5°-00' Long. 152°-42' (Point Rodger) to arrive at 2100, then up through St. George's Channel, around the west of Duke of York Island, pass into Blanche Bay, out south of Duke of York Island, down St. George's Channel to Point Rodger by 0330, then retire to Hathorn Sound. The principal assumption was that harassing the enemy would disrupt any of his aggressive plans and generally hasten his evacuation of that area. The U.S.S. WOODWORTH, at Purvis Bay {{in the early morning}} of 17 February, requested and obtained permission to rejoin the Squadron, which she did at about 1930, 17 February 1944.3) Intelligence reports indicated that the most probable points of enemy concentrations as first, the township of Rabaul, second, encampment area between Kokopo and Ulaved, north coast of Gazelle Peninsula, and third, shipping at anchor in Karavia Bay. Shore batteries were indicated at Praed Point, Raluana Point and Cape Gazelle. There was no information on probable mine fields except at the entrance to Simpson-Karavia Harbors. Intelligence could not furnish any navigational information in addition to that contained in H.O. chart 2970, edition of 1925. Information on probable size and location of shore batteries and radar detection units was obtained prior to the bombardment, but it is estimated, from the volume of fire delivered by the shore batteries, that they are actually of larger caliber and more numerous than reported.4) The state of the weather was definitely overcast enough for concealment of own forces. During the approach up St. George's Channel and until prior to commencing Phase I, surface visibility to approximately six miles, with a very low overcast. Sea calm; wind WNW, force 2. Moonrise was at 0050 the 18th of February 1944.Part 21) The approach was made with divisions in line of bearing, and was uneventful up to St. George's Channel (course 315° (T), speed 30 knots). At 2129 course was changed to 350° (T) at a point 5 miles north of Lat. 5°-00' S. Long. 152°-42' E. (Point Rodger). At 2207 course was changed to 345° (T). The intention was to stay about 5 miles {{to the west of the}} New Ireland coast. At 2230 course was changed to 005° (T). At 2240 the Squadron was brought into column. At 2304 changed course to 355° (T). Lights were sighted near Duke of York Island. They were identified as lighted sono buoy. At 2309 changed course to 315° (T). At 2345 course was changed to 270° (T) for anti-shipping sweep. The sweep proved negative. At 0017 course was changed to 120° (T) to return to the area of the Duke of York Islands. At 0046 course was changed to 160° (T) until leading ship reached Point Rooster (Lat. 4°-00' S. Long. 152°-21' E.) then at 0054 course was changed to 240° (T), ships in line of bearing 160° (T). Commenced making black (funnel) smoke on the approach. At 0104 Squadron was brought into column on course 160° (T) and speed was slowed to 20 knots. Several flashing sono buoys were observed around the approach to Karavia Bay. This ship was directed to fire counter battery. Opened fire on Praed Point shore batteries at 0107. At 0115 shifted counter battery fire to Raluana point to silence the shore battery there, the shore battery on Praed Point having been silenced with 141 rounds of ammunition. At 0116 changed course to 225° (T). At 0117 changed to 235° (T) and CIC commenced torpedo problem. At 0122 unmasked the starboard torpedo battery on course 180° (T). Checked gun fire at Raluana Point to fire torpedoes. Raluana Point battery silenced after this ship fired 56 rounds of ammunition at this battery. Heavy gunfire was observed inside Simpson Harbor-Karavia Bay, which was taken under fire by U.S.S. WOODWORTH and U.S.S. BUCHANAN on order of Commander Destroyer Squadron Twelve. It was determined later that this gunfire was from two enemy destroyers inside the bay. At 0124 fired low speed torpedoes on course 262° (T) into Karavia Bay, range 12,200 yards. The torpedoes were fired with a track to take them through the center of the mine field across the entrance to Karavia Bay (assumed to be the channel through the field) and directed to the spot reported as the most frequented anchorages inside Karavia Bay. At 0124 turned to 090° (T) to commence phase III shore bombardment. As the course was changed to the left, a salvo of what appeared to be 3" [...] or larger landed about 50 yards off the starboard bow. At the same time several torpedo tracks were observed running down the starboard side at a distance of about 50 yards. Opened fore at 0126 to the south into Vunapopo bivouac and supply area, range 7660 yards. At 0132 changed to 100° (T) to clear Credner Island. At 0134 changed course to 120° (T). At 0136 came to 090° (T). At 1136 our observation plane dropped a stick of bombs on Cape Gazelle shore batteries. At 0137 ceased firing Vunapopo area, having expended 244 rounds of ammunition, to shift to Cape Gazelle shore battery which at that time opened fire on the formation. Commenced laying FS smoke in addition to black smoke. At 0140 opened fire on Cape Gazelle shore batteries. At this time a salvo of heavy caliber was heard to pass overhead and succeeding salvos continued to go over intermittently until the shore battery was finally silenced. At 0145 changed course to 070° (T) in order to pass through the 200 fathom spot at the center of channel between Duke of York Island and Cape Gazelle, this force having previously been directed to stay in water of depth over 200 fathoms. At 0150 changed course to 090° (T). Salvos were observed to be landing in the water off Cape Gazelle from the fire of ships astern. Firing only with the after 5" [...] guns at 0152. At 0155, Cape Gazelle, approximately abeam to starboard, changed course to 120° (T), increased speed to 25 knots. At 0159 ceased firing, having expended 284 rounds of ammunition on the Cape Gazelle shore batteries. At 0200 a fire was reported on the fantail. The bloomer on the #4 gun had caught fire but was quickly extinguished. At 0200 increased speed to 30 knots. At 0202 ceased smoking on order from the Squadron Commander. Changed course to 165° (T). At 0205 a <b>hang-fire</b> was reported on gun #1. Gun #1 unloaded through the muzzle at 0210. At 0230 first unidentified plane reported. Until 0515, “bogies” were reported at intervals, singly and in groups (about four) (one dropped flares on starboard beam at about 0310). One “bogie” approached as close as 3 miles. Due to heavy overcast and rain squalls, the Squadron Commander felt reluctant to allow the ship to open fire and reveal our presence. At 0335 changed course to 135° (T) having cleared St. George's Channel." ...|$|E
40|$|The high firing {{rates of}} new and {{developing}} cannons create higher operating temperatures than projectiles experience. Higher temperatures in-bore bring the possibility of high explosive exudation from chambered shells during misfire, <b>hang-fire,</b> or hold-fire. The development of a finite element thermal model to predict high explosive exudation inside a hot gun tube brings an improved level of insight to existing physical test results. The MI 98 towed howitzer and M 107 155 -mm shell are modeled to compare to physical test results from Morales 1997 and Zimmerman 1980. During creation of the model special focus is taken to simulate the heat flow between the contact of the rotating band and cannon wall. A strong correlation between test results and model is seen with both reports and validates the model setup. Model results suggest that time to exudation predicted by Morales and Zimmerman may be too conservative...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of magneto rheological dampers for controlling {{the dynamics of}} a fire out-of-battery recoil system is examined, using a dynamic simulation of a 105 mm cannon. Upon providing a brief background on MR dampers and fire out-of-battery dynamics, we will describe the simulation model, {{along with some of}} the results obtained from the model. The simulation results show that although conventional hydraulic recoil dampers can be designed and tuned to control fire out-of-battery dynamics as effectively as MR dampers, they are not able to perform well when firing faults are encountered. The results show that MR dampers are able to adapt to the firing faults such as pre-fire, <b>hang-fire,</b> and misfire and provide "soft recoil" under all firing conditions. The inability of conventional hydraulic dampers to adapt to the firing faults can yield recoil dynamics that seriously jeopardize the performance of the gun. Therefore, the results presented here show that MR dampers may provide an enabling technology in achieving fire out-of-battery under all firing conditions...|$|E
40|$|This {{innovation}} {{consists of}} a pyrotechnic initiator and piezoelectric initiation system. The device will be capable of being initiated mechanically; resisting initiation by EMF, RF, and EMI (electromagnetic field, radio frequency, and electromagnetic interference, respectively); and initiating in water environments and space environments. Current devices of this nature are initiated by the mechanical action of a firing pin against a primer. Primers historically are prone to failure. These failures {{are commonly known as}} misfires or <b>hang-fires.</b> In many cases, the primer shows the dent where the firing pin struck the primer, but the primer failed to fire. In devices such as "T" handles, which are commonly used to initiate the blowout of canopies, loss of function of the device may result in loss of crew. In devices such as flares or smoke generators, failure can result in failure to spot a downed pilot. The piezoelectrically initiated ignition system {{consists of a}} pyrotechnic device that plugs into a mechanical system (activator), which on activation, generates a high-voltage spark. The activator, when released, will strike a stack of electrically linked piezo crystals, generating a high-voltage, low-amperage current that is then conducted to the pyro-initiator. Within the initiator, an electrode releases a spark that passes through a pyrotechnic first-fire mixture, causing it to combust. The combustion of the first-fire initiates a primary pyrotechnic or explosive powder. If used in a "T" handle, the primary would ramp the speed of burn up to the speed of sound, generating a shock wave that would cause a high explosive to go "high order. " In a flare or smoke generator, the secondary would produce the heat necessary to ignite the pyrotechnic mixture. The piezo activator subsystem is redundant in that a second stack of crystals would be struck at the same time with the same activation force, doubling the probability of a first strike spark generation. If the first activation fails to ignite, the device is capable of multiple attempts. Another unique aspect is {{in the design of the}} pyrotechnic device. There is an electrode that aids the generation of a directed spark and the use of a conductive matrix to support the first-fire material so that the spark will penetrate to the second electrode...|$|R
