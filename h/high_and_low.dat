40|$|We {{construct}} an empirical model for daily <b>highs</b> <b>and</b> daily <b>lows</b> of US stock indexes {{based on the}} intuition that <b>highs</b> <b>and</b> <b>lows</b> do not drift apart over time. Our empirical results show that daily <b>highs</b> <b>and</b> <b>lows</b> of three main US stock price indexes are cointegrated. Data on openings, closings, and trading volume are found to offer incremental explanatory power for variations in <b>highs</b> <b>and</b> <b>lows</b> within the VECM framework. With all these variables, the augmented VECM models explain 40 – 50 % of variations in daily <b>highs</b> <b>and</b> <b>lows.</b> The generalized impulse response analysis shows that the responses of daily <b>highs</b> <b>and</b> daily <b>lows</b> to the shocks depend on whether data on openings, closings, and trading volume {{are included in the}} analysis.

5|$|Kurosawa had {{meanwhile}} instructed Toho {{to purchase}} the film rights to King's Ransom, a novel about a kidnapping written by American author and screenwriter Evan Hunter, under his pseudonym of Ed McBain, {{as one of his}} 87th Precinct series of crime books. The director intended to create a work condemning kidnapping, which he considered one of the very worst crimes. The suspense film, titled <b>High</b> <b>and</b> <b>Low,</b> was shot during the latter half of 1962 and released in March 1963. It broke Kurosawa's box office record (the third film in a row to do so), became the highest grossing Japanese film of the year, and won glowing reviews. However, his triumph was somewhat tarnished when, ironically, the film was blamed for a wave of kidnappings which occurred in Japan about this time (he himself received kidnapping threats directed at his young daughter, Kazuko). <b>High</b> <b>and</b> <b>Low</b> is considered by many commentators to be among the director's strongest works.|$|E

5|$|Periyar {{stated that}} the caste system in south India is, due to Indo-Aryan influence, linked {{with the arrival of}} Brahmins from the north. Ancient Tamil Nadu (part of Tamilakkam) had a {{different}} stratification of society in four or five regions (Tinai), determined by natural surroundings and adequate means of living. Periyar also argued that birds, animals, and worms, which are considered to be devoid of rationalism do not create castes, or differences of <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> in their own species. But man, considered to be a rational being, was suffering from these because of religion and discrimination.|$|E

5|$|The {{indigenous}} {{people of the}} high desert region are the Northern Paiute people.

They make sandals, traps, and fishing nets, and weave baskets. Made out of sagebrush, willow, tule plant, Indian hemp, and sumac fibers, the baskets are tight enough to carry water.

5|$|Fauré {{was elected}} to the Institut de France in 1909, after his {{father-in-law}} and Saint-Saëns, both long-established members, had canvassed strongly on his behalf. He won the ballot by a narrow margin, with 18 votes against 16 for the other candidate, Widor. In the same year a group of young composers led by Ravel and Koechlin broke with the Société Nationale de Musique, which under the presidency of Vincent d'Indy had become a reactionary organisation, and formed a new group, the Société Musicale Indépendante. While Fauré accepted the presidency of this society, he also remained a member of the older one and continued on the best of terms with d'Indy; his sole concern was the fostering of new music. In 1911 he oversaw the Conservatoire's move to new premises in the rue de Madrid. During this time, Fauré developed serious problems with his hearing. Not only did he start to go deaf, but sounds became distorted, so that <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>low</b> notes sounded painfully out of tune to him.|$|E
