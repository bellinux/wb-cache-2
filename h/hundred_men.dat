5|$|According to {{government}} regulations concerning seagoing ships, the larger ones can carry several <b>hundred</b> <b>men,</b> {{and the smaller}} ones may {{have more than a}} <b>hundred</b> <b>men</b> on board. One of the most important merchants is chosen to be Leader (Gang Shou), another is Deputy Leader (Fu Gang Shou), and a third is Business Manager (Za Shi). The Superintendent of Merchant Shipping gives them an unofficially sealed red certificate permitting them to use the light bamboo for punishing their company when necessary. Should anyone die at sea, his property becomes forfeit to the government...The ship's pilots are acquainted with the configuration of the coasts; at night they steer by the stars, and in the day-time by the sun. In dark weather they look at the south-pointing needle (i.e. the magnetic compass). They also use a line a hundred feet long with a hook at the end which they let down to take samples of mud from the sea-bottom; by its (appearance and) smell they can determine their whereabouts.|$|E

One {{battalion}} of five <b>hundred</b> <b>men,</b> under Johnson's elder brother, James Johnson, engaged the British force of eight hundred regulars; simultaneously, Richard Johnson, with the other, now somewhat smaller battalion, attacked the fifteen hundred Indians led by Tecumseh. There was too much tree cover for the British volleys to be effective against James Johnson; three quarters of the regulars were killed or captured.|$|E

5|$|Ancient {{and modern}} historians {{provided}} different estimations {{for the number}} of ships and troops under the command of Basiliscus, {{as well as for the}} expenses of the expedition. Both were enormous; Nicephorus Gregoras speaks of one hundred thousand ships, the more reliable Cedrenus says that the fleet that attacked Carthage consisted of eleven hundred and thirteen ships, having each one <b>hundred</b> <b>men</b> on board. The most conservative estimation for expedition expenses is of 64,000pounds of gold, a sum that exceeded a whole year's revenue.|$|E

5|$|The Texian {{army was}} {{a force of}} 810 volunteers and staff at this point, but few had any {{military}} training and experience. Faced with past desertions, discipline flaws, and individual indecisiveness of volunteers in training, Houston knew they were {{not yet ready to}} engage the Mexican army. Compounding the situation were the civilian refugees dependent upon the army for their protection. The news of Fannin's capture, combined with his doubts about the readiness of the Texian army, led Houston to order a retreat on March 26. Some of the troops viewed the decision as cowardice with Sesma sitting just {{on the other side of}} the Colorado, and several <b>hundred</b> <b>men</b> deserted.|$|E
5|$|The {{destruction}} of the North Korean Army at Pusan made communist continuation of the war impossible with North Korean troops alone. The massive equipment and manpower losses rivaled those of the ROK Army in the first stages of the war. The North Koreans totally collapsed as a fighting force, and the remainder of their routed military retreated into North Korea offering very weak resistance against the UN force, which was now on the offensive with overwhelming superiority by land, air and sea. Many of the outmaneuvered North Korean units simply surrendered, having been reduced from units of thousands {{to just a few}} <b>hundred</b> <b>men.</b>|$|E

5|$|Thompson {{requested}} from Davis {{two days}} {{to work out the}} details of the surrender with his officers. The Confederates under the command of Thompson agreed to surrender all the troops in the area on May 11.

5|$|Although Cincinnati's African Americans were {{initially}} {{pressed into service}} at bayonet point, after the appointment of William Dickson as commander of the black troops their treatment improved significantly.

He then allowed them to return home to prepare for military service, with orders to report the next morning for duty. About four <b>hundred</b> <b>men</b> were released that day, September 4, and the next morning about seven hundred reported for duty. Among those men was Beaty, who served in Company Number 1 of the Brigade's 3rd Regiment. Despite the danger of Confederate attack, the unarmed unit was assigned to build defenses near the Licking River in Kentucky, far in advance of the Union lines. For the next fifteen days, they cleared forests, constructed forts, magazines and roads, and dug trenches and rifle pits. The brigade was disbanded on September 20, the threat of attack having receded.|$|E
