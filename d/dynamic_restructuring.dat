As an adaptive engineering approach todeveloping exible and reliable {{electronic commerce}} systems, we present the distributed transactional activity model (TAM) in this paper and report our experience in designing and implementing TAM. A distinct feature {{of this approach is}} the utilization of a family of <b>dynamic</b> activity <b>restructuring</b> operations that allow ongoing transactional activities to bypass some unexpected execution bottlenecks, and the notion of validity thatprovides correctness guarantees for the activity restructuring operations.

40|$|It {{has been}} broadly {{recognised}} that todayâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s manufacturing organisations face increasing pressures from continuous and unexpected {{changes in the}} business environment such as changes in product types, changes in demand pattern, changes in manufacturing technologies etc. To enable manufacturing organisations to rapidly and timely deal with these changes, operational decisions (e. g., process planning and production scheduling) have to be integrated with <b>dynamic</b> system <b>restructure</b> or reconfiguration so that manufacturing organisations do not only use the flexible resource utilisations {{to deal with these}} changes, but also can dynamically reconfigure their existing system structures in response these changes. A manufacturing system concept and implementation methodology is proposed by the Exeter Manufacturing Enterprise Centre (XMEC), which is called the Dynamically Integrated Manufacturing System (DIMS). The overall aim of DIMS is to provide a systematic modelling and control framework in which operational decisions can be integrated with the <b>dynamic</b> system <b>restructuring</b> decisions so as to help manufacturing systems to dynamically deal with changes in the business environment. This PhD research is a part of DIMS research, which focuses on the investigation on operational control in DIMS. Based on the established agent-based modelling architecture in DIMS, this research develops two agent bidding mechanisms for the hierarchical control of production planning and scheduling. These two mechanisms work together to assist manufacturing systems in making optimal and flexible operational decisions in response to changes in the business environment. The first mechanism is the iterative agent bidding mechanism based on a Genetic Algorithm (GA) which facilitates the determination of the optimal or near optimal allocation of a production job containing a set of sub-jobs to a pool of heterarchical resources. The second mechanism is the hierarchical agent bidding mechanism which enables product orders to be cost-efficiently and flexibly planned and scheduled to meet the ordersâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 due dates.

Here, we reveal that TAp 73 unexpectedly functions as an adhesion and maturation factor of the seminiferous epithelium orchestrating spermiogenesis. TAp 73 knockout (TAp 73 KO) and p 73 KO mice, but not ΔNp 73 KO mice, display a “near-empty seminiferous tubule” phenotype due to massive premature loss of immature germ cells. The cellular basis of this phenotype is defective cell–cell adhesions of developing germ cells to Sertoli nurse cells, with likely secondary degeneration of Sertoli cells, including the blood–testis barrier, which leads to disruption of the adhesive integrity and maturation of the germ epithelium. At the molecular level, TAp 73, which is produced in germ cells, controls a coordinated transcriptional program of adhesion- and migration-related proteins including peptidase inhibitors, proteases, receptors, and integrins required for germ–Sertoli cell adhesion and <b>dynamic</b> junctional <b>restructuring.</b> Thus, we propose the testis as a unique organ with strict division of labor among all family members: p 63 and p 53 safeguard germ line fidelity, whereas TAp 73 ensures fertility by enabling sperm maturation...|$|R
