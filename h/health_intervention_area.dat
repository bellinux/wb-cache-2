40|$|The {{health and}} diet impacts of a {{large-scale}} food retail development within a deprived area of Glasgow (Springburn) are reported. The study used a prospective quasi-experimental design which compared changes in diet and psychological health {{in an area}} where a new hypermarket was built (the <b>intervention</b> <b>area)</b> with a similarly deprived comparison area in Glasgow (Shettleston). A postal survey was undertaken both before and one year after the hypermarket was built, to assess changes in diet, self-reported health, and perceptions of neighbourhood. Changes in the retail structure of both areas were assessed through a ‘before-and-(repeated) -after’ intervention shop count survey. Qualitative data on diet, the neighbourhood, and the impact of the store were collected through focus groups. The quantitative study found limited improvements in diet and health. There was weak evidence for the impact of the hypermarket on population diet. There was weak evidence that poor psychological <b>health</b> in the <b>intervention</b> <b>area</b> reduced. Amongst those who ‘switched’ to the new hypermarket there was weak evidence of a small improvement in mean fruit and vegetable consumption but good evidence of psychological health improvement. Qualitative and retail survey results reinforce this, identifying perceptions of areal improvement through redevelopment and a small positive impact of the new store on the retail structure of the <b>intervention</b> <b>area.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Background: Detailed {{information}} regarding the spatial and/or spatial temporal distribution of mortality {{is required for the}} efficient implementation and targeting of public <b>health</b> <b>interventions.</b> Objectives: Identify high risk clusters of mortality within the Agincourt subdistrict for targeting of public <b>health</b> <b>interventions,</b> and highlight <b>areas</b> for further research. Design: Mortality data were extracted from the Agincourt health and socio-demographic surveillance system (HDSS) for the period 1992 2007. Mortality rates by age group and time were calculated assuming a Poisson distribution and using precise person-time contribution estimates. A spatial scan statistic (Kulldorff) was used to test for clusters of age group specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality both in space and time. Results: Many statistically significant clusters of higher all-cause and cause-specific mortality were identified both in space and time. Specific areas were consistently identified as high risk areas; namely, the east/southeast and upper east central regions. This corresponds to areas with higher mortality due to communicable causes (especially HIV/TB and diarrheal disease) and indicates a non-random element to the distribution of potential underlying causative factors e. g. settlements comprising former Mozambican refugees in east/southeast of the site, corresponding higher poverty areas, South African villages with higher HIV prevalence, etc. Clusters of older adult mortality were also observed indicating potential non-random distribution of noncommunicabl...|$|R

40|$|Background: There is a {{need for}} more studies that analyse {{evaluation}} methods in the context of maternal health promotion. These should assess the effectiveness of <b>health</b> promotion <b>interventions</b> on <b>health</b> outcomes, factors contributing to impact, and transferability. This thesis reports on an evaluation of one such intervention in Nepal targeting rural women to promote maternal health. Methods: A mixed-methods approach was used where, first, a Difference-in- Difference (DiD) estimation assessed the effects of the intervention on selected outcome variables while controlling for: 1) a constructed wealth index; and 2) women’s socio-economic characteristics in a five-year controlled, non-randomised, repeated cross-sectional study of a community-based <b>health</b> promotion <b>intervention</b> targeting maternal <b>health</b> in Nepal. Second, the qualitative data were analysed to explore the knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs of women post-intervention. Finally, the financial data were analysed to identify resources needed and estimate the cost of the <b>health</b> promotion <b>intervention.</b> Results: After five years, women in the <b>intervention</b> <b>area</b> were more likely to seek antenatal care at least once, to take iron/folic acid, and to attend postnatal care. The intervention did not influence women’s place of birth or likelihood of receiving care from a skilled birth attendant. However, it did improve attendance for the recommended four antenatal visits for the first two and a half years. The qualitative findings helped explain some of the changes or lack thereof, where in the <b>intervention</b> <b>area</b> women were perceived, by the researcher, as empowered, confident, and the family as supportive. The cost of providing the <b>health</b> promotion <b>intervention</b> per group/woman and the evaluation process consisted of only 10 % of the total programme cost. Conclusion: This is the first community-based <b>health</b> promotion <b>intervention</b> that has demonstrated a greater impact during pregnancy (i. e., uptake of antenatal care) than around birth (i. e., changes in delivery care). Other factors, not easily resolved through <b>health</b> promotion <b>interventions,</b> may influence birth outcomes, such as financial liquidity or geographical constraints. The evaluation showed that using mixed methods provided valuable information {{that would not have been}} extracted through one method alone. While DiD is a precise tool for measurement, the qualitative research provided insight into why the intervention had an impact in pregnancy but not at birth...|$|R

The primary objective of this review was to determine the current state of play on the use of social media as a <b>health</b> <b>intervention</b> in addressing the health of adolescents. Methods Six databases were searched: CINAHL, Medline, Scopus, ProQuest, Psych Info and Science Direct, from 2000 - 2013. The review process followed PRISMA guidelines with quality assessments of the selected articles undertaken. Results Three studies used social media as a <b>health</b> <b>intervention</b> in adolescent <b>health.</b> Facebook was the social media of choice. The way this social media tool was incorporated as the intervention varied. None of the social media interventions had a significant or sustained impact on the primary outcomes of the studies reviewed. Measures of social media process were limited and lacked meaning. Conclusions The selected papers provided insight into the beginning phase of using social media as a <b>health</b> <b>intervention</b> to address adolescent health. The review highlights three important areas for consideration when undertaking research on the use of social media as a <b>health</b> <b>intervention</b> for adolescents: the newness of using social media as a <b>health</b> <b>intervention,</b> the importance of the use of rigorous methodological processes when using social media as a <b>health</b> <b>intervention,</b> and the need to develop further knowledge on adolescents' use of social media, in particular their hidden world of social media.

40|$|Abstract Background Information {{on adult}} {{mortality}} is essentially non-existent in Ethiopia particularly {{from rural areas}} where access to health services is limited and most deaths occur at home. This {{study was conducted with}} the aim of identifying causes of adult death in a rural population of Ethiopia using a simplified verbal autopsy instrument. Methods All deaths in the age-group 15 – 49 years during the period of 1995 – 99 were taken from computerized demographic surveillance database maintained by the Butajira Rural Health Program. Data on the causes of death were collected from close relatives of the deceased persons by lay interviewers. Causes of death were diagnosed using "expert algorithm" programmed onto a computer. Results The major causes of death were acute febrile illnesses (25. 2 %), liver diseases (11. 3 %), diarrheal diseases (11. 1 %), tuberculosis (9. 7 %) and HIV/AIDS (7. 4 %). Overall communicable diseases accounted for 60. 8 % of the deaths. The high levels of mortality from communicable diseases reflect the poor socioeconomic development of the country, and the general poor coverage of health and education services in rural Ethiopia. The tools used in this study can easily be added-on to the numerous health surveys conducted in the country. Conclusion The simplified approach to verbal autopsy diagnosis can produce useful data that can effectively guide priority <b>health</b> <b>interventions</b> in rural <b>areas</b> where routine information system is either very weak or non-existent. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background This study {{aimed at}} {{providing}} information for priority {{setting in the}} health care sector of Zimbabwe as well as assessing the efficiency of resource use. A general approach proposed by the World Bank involving the estimation of the burden of disease measured in Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) and calculation of cost-effectiveness ratios for a large number of <b>health</b> <b>interventions</b> was followed. Methods Costs per DALY for a total of 65 <b>health</b> <b>interventions</b> were estimated. Costing data were collected through visits to health centres, hospitals and vertical programmes where a combination of step-down and micro-costing was applied. Effectiveness of <b>health</b> <b>interventions</b> was estimated based on published information on the efficacy adjusted for factors such as coverage and compliance. Results Very cost-effective interventions were available for the major health problems. Using estimates of the burden of disease, the present paper developed packages of <b>health</b> <b>interventions</b> using the estimated cost-effectiveness ratios. These packages could avert a quarter of the burden of disease at total costs corresponding to one tenth of the public health budget in the financial year 1997 / 98. In general, the analyses suggested that there was substantial potential for improving the efficiency of resource use in the public health care sector. Discussion The proposed World Bank approach applied to Zimbabwe was extremely data demanding and required extensive data collection in the field and substantial human resources. The most important limitation of the study was the scarcity of evidence on effectiveness of <b>health</b> <b>interventions</b> so that a range of important <b>health</b> <b>interventions</b> could not be included in the cost-effectiveness analysis. This and other limitations could in principle be overcome if more research resources were available. Conclusion The present study showed that it was feasible to conduct cost-effectiveness analyses for a large number of <b>health</b> <b>interventions</b> in a developing country like Zimbabwe using a consistent methodology. </p...|$|R
