5|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> {{the onset}} that Stephen's reign in Serbia would be short-lived. The Ottoman sultan Mehmed the Conqueror {{considered}} Stephen's enthronement an unwarranted violation {{of his own}} rights, for the Ottomans too considered Serbia their vassal state. Mehmed promptly launched an attack on Smederevo in June, {{and there was no}} serious consideration of trying to defend it. King Thomas rushed to his son's aid, trying to divert the Turks by laying siege to their fortress of Hodidjed, in the middle of Bosnia. Aware that Smederevo could not withstand Mehmed's attack, Stephen surrendered the fortress on 20 June. The Ottoman proceeded to annex the rest of the Serbian state to their empire within a year.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the poor}} {{response}} to the demand for the surrender of weapons, the deadline was extended several times until a date of 8 July was fixed. On 17 May, court-martials were established to try those that were arrested in possession of weapons, and those found guilty were immediately executed by firing squad. The precedent for this brutal repressive measure against Serbs had already been established by the Germans. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> the outset that the NDH weapons laws were not being enforced as strictly against Croats as they were against Serbs. Securing the border between eastern Herzegovina and Montenegro was considered a high priority due to concerns that the Montenegrin Federalist Party had revived Montenegrin claims to parts of the NDH that had been promised to the Kingdom of Montenegro in the 1915 Treaty of London.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> the {{beginning}} of the CryoSat programme that an extensive series of measurements would be needed, both to understand interaction of the radar waves with the surface of the ice caps and to relate the measured freeboard of floating sea ice with its thickness. This latter, in particular, would have to take account of snow loading. For sea ice, which moves as it is blown by the wind, it was also necessary to develop techniques which could give consistent results when measured from platforms travelling at different speed (scientists on the surface, helicopter-towed sounders, aircraft-borne radars and CryoSat itself). A number of campaigns were performed under a programme called CRYOVEX which aimed to address each of the identified areas of uncertainty. These campaigns continued through the development of the original CryoSat and were planned to continue after its launch.|$|E

5|$|The system {{originated}} {{from one of}} several powerful tropical waves that moved off {{the west coast of}} Africa {{in the second half of}} August. When the wave came off the African coast, it already had cyclonic rotation, although it was fairly disorganized. As the wave moved westward into open waters, it developed rapidly. Late on August 21, it formed a low-level circulation and was declared Tropical Depression Nine. The system quickly matured and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Humberto early on August 22. Beginning on a west-northwest track, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> the outset that Humberto would not affect land, due to a weakness in the subtropical ridge to the north which would eventually turn the storm northward. Favorable outflow and distinct banding pattern quickly formed in a very conducive environment, with warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear. Humberto intensified into a high-end tropical storm on the afternoon and evening of August 22. Early on August 23, the storm was upgraded to Hurricane Humberto.|$|E
5|$|There were {{professional}} {{musicians in}} the previous three generations of Holst's family and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> his early years that he would follow the same calling. He hoped to become a pianist, but was prevented by neuritis in his right arm. Despite his father's reservations, he pursued {{a career as a}} composer, studying at the Royal College of Music under Charles Villiers Stanford. Unable to support himself by his compositions, he played the trombone professionally and later became a teacher—a great one, according to his colleague Ralph Vaughan Williams. Among other teaching activities he built up a strong tradition of performance at Morley College, where he served as musical director from 1907 until 1924, and pioneered music education for women at St Paul's Girls' School, where he taught from 1905 until his death in 1934. He was the founder of a series of Whitsun music festivals, which ran from 1916 for the remainder of his life.|$|E

25|$|Early on 16 July, Nehring renewed his attack. Indian 5th Infantry Brigade {{pushed them}} back but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> intercepted radio traffic that a further attempt would be made. Accordingly, strenuous {{preparations}} {{to dig in}} anti-tank guns were made, artillery fire plans organised and a regiment from 22nd Armoured Brigade was sent to reinforce 2nd Armoured Brigade. When Nehring's renewed attack came late in the afternoon, it was repulsed. After the battle, the Indians counted 24 destroyed tanks, as well as armoured cars and numerous anti-tank guns left on the battlefield.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} he lived in Bath, and played once for Somerset in 1905, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> his failure then that {{he could no longer}} play serious cricket. His weight gain, {{combined}} with a congenital heart abnormality, resulted in a fatal heart attack at the age of 41, whilst on a summer walking holiday in Chambéry, France. According to a number of sources (including Herbert Strudwick), he had been in good health and spirits before leaving England. A widespread rumour that he had committed suicide was disproved by research carried out by Ralph Barker. Richardson was buried in Richmond Cemetery.|$|E

While the National Command invoked party rules and regulations against the Military Committee, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> the beginning that the initiative lay with the Military Committee. The reason for the Military Committee's success was its alliance with the Regionalists, a group of branches which had not adhered to Aflaq's 1958 orders to dissolve the Syrian Regional Branch. The Regionalists disliked Aflaq and opposed his leadership. Assad called the Regionalists the [...] "true cells of the party".|$|E

[...] The focus of the investigators and the public shifted to safety systems which could have prevented the crash and the design of the commuter rail cars themselves.|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{after the}} company was founded, {{production}} started in the SAT factory in Vallila, Helsinki. The Yhteissisu vehicles were built separately from SAT vehicles. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> the start that vehicles should be produced away from Helsinki; the company sought a suitable location close to good rail, road and waterway connections. The original idea was to build the factory inside caves mined into bedrock; the place {{would be required to}} have suitable geology. A suitable area was finally found in Vanaja next to Hämeenlinna. Yhteissisu bought [...] of land on 14 March 1944. A contract for factory construction was signed with a contractor on 30 March. The Railway Administration accepted Yhteissisu's plan to build a railway connection in the area. Quarrying work for the underground workshop began in July 1944. The expense and a shortage of time meant the plan had to be amended, and the entire production area was built above ground. The factory buildings were completed in early November 1944. Alvar Aalto's architectural office designed houses for the factory workers.|$|E

500|$|When Louis IX {{made his}} {{decision}} on 23 January 1264, {{it was entirely}} in favour of Henry III. The settlement starts out by reiterating the declarations of the two parties, where they place the decision fully {{in the hands of}} the French king. Louis invoked the difficulties England had suffered over the previous years, and stressed the importance of a resolution. Since the pope had already invalidated the provisions, Louis decided to [...] "...quash and invalidate all these provisions, ordinances, and obligations, or whatever else they may be called...", and absolved the king from any adherence to them. Castles that were handed over to the barons as part of the agreement were to be given back to the king, and Henry should be free to appoint his own ministers. The only concession made to the barons was a general pardon extended to those involved in the conflict. The financial demands of King Henry were not mentioned. Louis was a firm believer in the royal prerogative, and was never likely to embrace the precedents set by the barons' infringement of Henry's authority. There was also the papal annulment to take into account, which the deeply pious Louis was not going to ignore. At the same time, Henry's wife Eleanor of Provencewho was Louis' sister-in-lawhad worked hard to procure a favourable decision for her husband. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>clear</b> <b>from</b> the start though, that the French king had gone too far in his partisan decision, and that the settlement was little more than a dead letter.|$|E
