50|$|The bushes {{can suffer}} from pests such as <b>Gooseberry</b> <b>sawfly</b> and Birds.|$|E
5000|$|The English name <b>gooseberry</b> <b>sawfly</b> {{refers to}} at least three species of sawfly: ...|$|E
50|$|Nematus leucotrochus is {{a species}} of sawfly in the family Tenthredinidae, known as the pale-spotted <b>gooseberry</b> <b>sawfly.</b> Widespread {{throughout}} central and northern Europe, this insect {{is best known as}} a pest of gooseberries. The larvae feed on the foliage of the plant, defoliating it. Unlike Nematus ribesii, the common <b>gooseberry</b> <b>sawfly,</b> the species has a single brood. Adults appear in early May and larvae in May and June.|$|E
50|$|Nematus ribesii is {{a species}} of sawfly in the family Tenthredinidae. English names include common <b>gooseberry</b> <b>sawfly</b> and {{imported}} currantworm. This insect {{is best known as}} a pest of gooseberries. The larvae feed on the foliage of the plant, often defoliating it completely.|$|E
50|$|Other {{potential}} {{threats are}} V-moth (Macaria wauaria) and <b>Gooseberry</b> <b>sawfly</b> (Nematus ribesii). Nematus ribesii grubs will bury {{themselves in the}} ground to pupate; on hatching into adult form, they lay their eggs, which soon hatch into larvae, {{on the underside of}} gooseberry leaves. Insecticides used in the 19th-century against these included tar water, weak solutions of carbolic acid, and powdered hellebore, which worked against magpie moths and V-moths as well as gooseberry sawflies. (Foxglove and tobacco infusions were also sometimes used.) A 2008 study concluded that a solution of magnesium sulfate applied to a bush's leaves has a good residual action on the eggs and larvae of <b>gooseberry</b> <b>sawfly,</b> and also appears to deter egg-laying female sawflies. Careful removal of fallen leaves and tilling of the ground around the plant will also destroy most eggs and chrysalises of these insects.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} a hymenopteran, {{not a true}} fly. This insect can produce three generations per year, with larvae {{emerging}} between April and September. It differs in this respect from Nematus leucotrochus, the pale-spotted <b>gooseberry</b> <b>sawfly,</b> which has a single generation. The female sawfly lays eggs on the undersides of the leaves and the larvae work their way upwards, stripping the plant of foliage. The larva of this species of sawfly is up to 2 centimeters long and green in color with a black head and black spots along the body. The adult is yellowish with black markings, the females slightly larger than the males.|$|E
