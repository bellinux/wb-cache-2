5|$|In 1974, Mahathir was {{appointed}} as a Minister in Tun Razak's Cabinet. He became the Deputy Prime Minister <b>just</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> later, under Tun Hussein Onn, who had succeeded Tun Razak upon the latter's sudden death.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} five years, Haim played local venues but did not {{consider}} music as a professional career, because all three sisters were busy with other projects. Este was studying at UCLA and graduated in 2010 {{with a degree in}} Ethnomusicology (completed in <b>just</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> instead of the normal five), specializing in Bulgarian and Brazilian music.|$|E
5|$|Kenya {{has held}} three more ivory burns since 1989. The second was <b>just</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> later in 1991, {{destroying}} 6.8 tons. Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki held the country's third event in 2011, destroying another five tons of ivory.|$|E

5|$|Ross {{declined}} {{to become the}} first Texas governor to run for a third term, and left office on January 20, 1891. During his four years in office, he vetoed only ten bills, and pardoned 861 people. Compared to other Texas governors, these are small numbers; Governor Miriam A. Ferguson granted 1161 pardons in <b>just</b> <b>two</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2004, <b>just</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> {{before the}} release of the VE Commodore, Holden {{unveiled}} the Torana TT36 concept car at the Australian International Motor Show in Sydney. The TT36 served as a preview of the VE and allowed Holden to gauge public reaction to its styling. Much of the Torana's styling drew on the essence of the VE's design. Some production-ready components even carried over from the TT36 including the steering wheel, the window and rear-view mirror switch cluster and the handbrake lever.|$|E
5|$|In the 1993–94 season, the Bulls, without Jordan, {{achieved}} a 55–27 record, {{and lost to}} the New York Knicks {{in the second round}} of the playoffs. But the 1994–95 Bulls were a shell of the championship team of <b>just</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> earlier. Struggling at mid-season to ensure a spot in the playoffs, Chicago was 31–31 at one point in mid-March. The team received help, however, when Jordan decided to return to the NBA for the Bulls.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the AT-6, Textron will demonstrate the capabilities of their Scorpion twin-engine two-seat attack jet, expected to easily outperform the propeller planes. Textron secretly put together the Scorpion with off-the-shelf aircraft parts in <b>just</b> <b>two</b> <b>year’s</b> time, and presumably would require more {{time and money to}} put it into production than the AT-6 or A-29.|$|R

5|$|Most {{of these}} eleven fossils include {{impressions}} of feathers. Because these feathers are of an advanced form (flight feathers), these fossils are {{evidence that the}} evolution of feathers began before the Late Jurassic. The type specimen of Archaeopteryx was discovered <b>just</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> after Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species. Archaeopteryx seemed to confirm Darwin's theories and has since become a key piece of evidence for the origin of birds, the transitional fossils debate, and confirmation of evolution.|$|E
5|$|The last OE {{service to}} this station {{operated}} on June 19, 1931, {{after the company}} requested, and received, permission from the Interstate Commerce Commission to abandon that section of route because of declining ridership and worsening traffic congestion. The service was cut back to Front and Jefferson streets the following day, and OE moved its ticket office to that location. The tracks along 10th and Salmon streets were abandoned and soon removed. <b>Just</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> later, in May 1933, the Oregon Electric discontinued all its remaining passenger service, becoming exclusively a freight railroad.|$|E
5|$|Although the Chester Canal was not {{a success}} as traffic was sparse, this changed once it was {{connected}} to the Ellesmere Canal. The Ellesmere company expected to carry limestone from the quarries at Llanymynech and Trevor, iron from the ironworks at Ruabon and Bersham, and coal from mines at Chirk, Ruabon and Wrexham to Chester, Liverpool and Shrewsbury. The canal to Bersham and Wrexham was not built, and that to Shrewsbury was built much later on, but trade in coal, limestone, lime and building materials developed within the network of canals, and traffic between the canals and Liverpool increased steadily, much of it passing along the former Chester Canal. Receipts for the Ellesmere Canal were £12,568 in 1807 and £15,707 <b>just</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> later.|$|E

5|$|By 1976, both leagues {{were dealing}} with serious {{financial}} problems. The St. Louis Blues {{were on the verge}} of bankruptcy. Talk of a merger between the NHL and the WHA was growing. In 1976, for the first time in four decades, the NHL approved franchise relocations; the Scouts moved after <b>just</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> in Kansas City to Denver to become the Colorado Rockies, while the California Golden Seals became the Cleveland Barons. Two years later, after failed overtures about merging the Barons with Washington and Vancouver, the Barons merged with the Minnesota North Stars, reducing the NHL to 17 teams for 1978–79.|$|E
5|$|Dunstan also faced {{difficulties}} {{on policy}} issues. Factional cracks {{began to appear}} in Labor and the discovery of uranium deposits near the northern outback town of Roxby Downs put the premier in a bind. The uranium was seen as a valuable economic boost in difficult times, but a government ban on its mining on safety grounds was still in force. Dunstan was opposed to uranium mining but he was seen as lacking in conviction by environmentalists, as well as being criticised by industrialists. By May, his approval rating had fallen to 57%, down from 80% <b>just</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> earlier, while unemployment increased. It was also widely anticipated that a book named It's Grossly Improper would soon be released, containing embarrassing allegations about Dunstan's private life.|$|E
5|$|Hamm {{made her}} debut for the United States women's {{national}} soccer team in 1987 {{at the age}} of 15 — <b>just</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> after the team played its first international match. She was the youngest person ever to play for the team. She scored her first goal during her 17th appearance. She competed in four FIFA Women's World Cup tournaments: the inaugural 1991 in China, 1995 in Sweden, 1999 and 2003 in the United States. She led the team at three Olympic Games, including: 1996 in Atlanta (the first time women's soccer was played), 2000 in Sydney, and 2004 in Athens. In total, she played 42 matches and scored 14 goals in international tournaments.|$|E

5|$|In 1961 {{the synagogue}} began {{granting}} women some pulpit honors, giving the Sisterhood President gelila, and in 1966 granting married couples hagbaha and gelila (the honors of lifting and re-wrapping the Torah {{after it has}} been read). In the 1970s, women became more involved in the synagogue's political and religious activities: in 1972, the first woman was elected to the board of trustees, and in 1975, the congregation began calling women to the Torah and counting women in the minyan, the latter <b>just</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> after the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of the Rabbinical Assembly voted nine to four in favor of this innovation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Just</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> after Ruth's sale, {{he went on}} to have {{a record}} setting season—statistically, one of the {{greatest}} in major league history for a batter. This propelled the Yankees to capture their first pennant and face their rival Giants. On October 5, 1921, the Yankees appeared in and won their very first World Series game. Ruth got hurt during the Series, and the Yankees eventually dropped the last three games, losing the Series five games to three to the Giants in the last ever best-of-nine Series. Both the Yankees and Giants would play in the 1922 World Series as well, a series that would be the Yankees' last in the two teams' shared stadium at the Polo Grounds as the Giants served the Yankees an eviction notice after the 1921 season.|$|E
5|$|Schmid {{was named}} the first coach of the new {{expansion}} franchise, Seattle Sounders FC. In their 2009 inaugural season, Seattle defeated D.C. United to win the U.S. Open Cup. On October 24, 2009, Seattle defeated FC Dallas 2–1, giving Schmid his 125th career MLS regular season win; this win moved Schmid past Bob Bradley for the most wins in MLS history. He led Seattle to the playoffs where, in the first round, the Dynamo defeated the team 1–0 in overtime of the second leg. Seattle was the first expansion team {{to make the playoffs}} in an inaugural season since the 1998 Chicago Fire, when the league was <b>just</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> old.|$|E

5|$|Successful mining {{took time}} and capital, {{particularly}} once {{most of the}} timber around the Klondike had been cut down. A realistic mining operation required $1,500 ($1.2 million) for wood to be burned to melt the ground, along with around $1,000 ($800,000) to construct a dam, $1,500 ($1.2 million) for ditches and up to $600 ($480,000) for sluice boxes, a total of $4,600. The attraction of the Klondike to a prospector, however, was that when gold was found, it was often highly concentrated. Some of the creeks in the Klondike were fifteen times richer in gold than those in California, and richer still than those in South Africa. In <b>just</b> <b>two</b> <b>years,</b> for example, $230,000 ($184 million) worth of gold was brought up from claim 29 on the Eldorado Creek.|$|E
5|$|While Bolton {{finished}} 4th {{the following}} season, the next 20 years {{would prove to}} be a fallow period. The club suffered relegation to the Second Division in 1963–64, and were then relegated again to the Third Division {{for the first time in}} their history in 1970–71. This stay in the Third Division lasted <b>just</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> before the club were promoted as champions in 1972–73. Hopes were high at Burnden Park in May 1978 when Bolton sealed the Second Division title and gained promotion to the First Division. However, they only remained there for two seasons before being relegated.|$|E
5|$|Aigusta {{was baptized}} as Anastasia {{in order to}} marry Simeon of Russia in 1333; he became Grand Prince of Moscow in 1341. There is no direct {{evidence}} {{that she was a}} daughter of Gediminas, but because the marriage was high-profile, most historians have concluded that {{she was a member of}} Gediminas' family. The marriage had great potential because Lithuania and Moscow were fierce rivals for supremacy in Ruthenia, but conflicts broke out again in 1335, <b>just</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> after the marriage. Her two sons Vasilei and Konstantin did not survive infancy; her daughter Vasilisa married Mikhail Vasilevich of Kashin, a Tverite prince opposing Lithuania. Her brother Jaunutis sought her help when he was deposed by Algirdas in 1345. Immediately before her death on 11 March 1345 Aigusta became a nun. She was buried within the Moscow Kremlin at a monastic church whose construction she had sponsored.|$|E
