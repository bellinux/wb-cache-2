5|$|Charitable trusts in English law are {{a form of}} <b>express</b> <b>trust</b> {{dedicated}} to charitable goals. There {{are a variety of}} advantages to charitable trust status, including exception from most forms of tax and freedom for the trustees not found in other types of English trust. To be a valid charitable trust, the organisation must demonstrate both a charitable purpose and a public benefit. Applicable charitable purposes are normally divided into categories for public benefit including the relief of poverty, the promotion of education, the advancement of health and saving of lives, promotion of religion and all other types of trust recognised by the law. There is also a requirement that the trust's purposes benefit the public (or some section of the public), and not simply a group of private individuals.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{advantages}} to charity status. Within English trusts law, a standard <b>express</b> <b>trust</b> has a relationship between the trustees and the beneficiaries; this does not apply to charitable trusts, partially because of the special definition of trustee used and partially because there are no individual beneficiaries identified in a charitable trust. Instead, the Attorney General of England and Wales sues on behalf of beneficiaries to enforce a charitable trust. Because of this lack of a relationship, the trustees' powers are far wider-ranging, only being regulated by the Charity Commission and actions brought by the Attorney General; the beneficiaries have no direct control. Charitable trusts are also exempt from many formalities when being created, including the rule against perpetuities. The trustees are also not required to act unanimously, only with a majority.|$|E

40|$|The Uniform Trustee Act {{provides}} for the enforcement of certain non-charitable purpose trusts. This paper draws on that concept but extends it by recommending {{an expansion of the}} range of potential enforcement methods for all types of <b>express</b> <b>trusts</b> whether they are for non-charitable purposes, charitable purposes or for persons. In particular, it recommends that, for all types of <b>express</b> <b>trusts,</b> settlors be allowed to indicate possible enforcers. It also recommends that courts be allowed, unless the settlor indicates otherwise, to grant standing to persons to enforce <b>express</b> <b>trusts</b> whether for persons, non-charitable purposes or charitable purposes. It further recommends allowing for Crown enforcement of all types of <b>express</b> <b>trusts</b> (not just charitable purpose trusts) in statutorily specified situations and it recommends extending the availability of cypr√®s and administrative scheme orders to statutorily-identified non-charitable purpose trusts. The paper also argues that with Crown enforcement of all types of <b>express</b> <b>trusts</b> in statutorily specified situations, it is no longer necessary to retain several of the distinct features of charitable purpose trusts, such as exclusivity, public benefit and the invalidity of political purpose trusts. * Mark Gillen (B.

5|$|As {{a form of}} <b>express</b> <b>trust,</b> {{charitable}} trusts {{are subject}} to certain formalities, {{as well as the}} requirements of the three certainties, when being created. These vary depending on whether the gift that creates the trust is given in life, given after death, or includes land. If the gift is given after death through a will, the will must comply with Section 9 of the Wills Act 1837, which requires that the will be in writing and signed by the testator (or somebody else present, at the testator's instruction), {{it is clear that the}} testator intended to give effect to the will, and the signature is made or noted by two or more witnesses. If these are all carried out, the will is a valid document, and the gift made as part of it can create a charitable trust. If the gift is of land and made during the donor's lifetime, it must comply with Section 53(1)(b) of the Law of Property Act 1925, which requires that the agreement be a written document signed by the person giving it. If the gift is of personal property and made inter vivos, there are no formal requirements; it is enough that an oral declaration is made creating the trust. Once constituted properly, a charitable trust, like all express trusts, cannot be undone unless there is something allowing that within the trust instrument.|$|E
25|$|Implied trust: An implied trust, as {{distinct}} from an <b>express</b> <b>trust,</b> is created {{where some of the}} legal requirements for an <b>express</b> <b>trust</b> are not met, but an intention on behalf of the parties to create a trust can be presumed to exist. A resulting trust may be deemed to be present where a trust instrument is not properly drafted and a portion of the equitable title has not been provided for. In such a case, the law may raise a resulting trust {{for the benefit of the}} grantor (the creator of the trust). In other words, the grantor may be deemed to be a beneficiary of the portion of the equitable title that was not properly provided for in the trust document.|$|E
25|$|Express trust: An <b>express</b> <b>trust</b> arises where a settlor {{deliberately}} and consciously {{decides to}} create a trust, over their assets, either now, or upon his or her later death. In these cases this will be achieved by signing a trust instrument, which will either be a will or a trust deed. Almost all trusts {{dealt with in the}} trust industry are of this type. They contrast with resulting and constructive trusts. The intention of the parties to create the trust must be shown clearly by their language or conduct. For an <b>express</b> <b>trust</b> to exist, there must be certainty to the objects of the trust and the trust property. In the USA Statute of Frauds provisions require express trusts to be evidenced in writing if the trust property is above a certain value, or is real estate.|$|E

25|$|Trusts go by many {{different}} names, {{depending on the}} characteristics or {{the purpose of the}} trust. Because trusts often have multiple characteristics or purposes, a single trust might accurately be described in several ways.

500|$|... 53(1)(b) of the Law of Property Act 1925 {{requires}} that [...] "a {{declaration of trust}} respecting any land or any interest therein must be manifested and proved by some writing signed by some person {{who is able to}} declare such trust or by his will". section 53(1)(a) said [...] "no interest in land can be created or disposed of except by writing signed by the person creating or conveying the same, or by his agent thereunto lawfully authorised in writing, or by will, or by operation of law". [...] Two cases, [...] Re Baillie and Ottaway v Norman, have concerned secret trusts over land. In neither case the formality requirements are said to be neglected, but neither judgment expressly considered why 53(1)(a) and 53(1)(b) made an impact that an prima facie <b>express</b> <b>trust</b> could be set up. This has been used to be an argument that secret trusts are constructive but in light of both cases it appears not. However, an <b>express</b> <b>trust</b> may still be exempted from the requirements of 53(1)(a) and 53(1)(b) by a separate application of the equitable maxim [...] "equity will not allow a statute {{to be used as a}} cloak for fraud" [...] the fraud would be for the trustee to deny the existence of the secret trust, but this time the statute concerned would be the Law of Property Act, a line of reasoning dependent upon the case of Rochefoucauld v Boustead. Also, the correct interpretation of secret trust in light of [...] "au dehor" [...] theory strongly affirms that the secret trust can operate outside the Law of Property Act and still be an <b>express</b> <b>trust.</b>|$|E
500|$|For an <b>express</b> <b>trust</b> to be valid, {{the trust}} {{instrument}} must show certainty of intention, {{subject matter and}} object. Certainty of intention means {{that it must be}} clear that the settlor or testator wishes to create a trust; this is not dependent on any particular language used, and a trust can be created without the word [...] "trust" [...] being used, or even the settlor knowing he is creating a trust. Since the 1950s, the courts have been more willing to conclude that there was intention to create a trust, rather than hold that the trust is void. Certainty of subject matter means that it must be clear what property is part of the trust. Historically the property must have been segregated from non-trust property; more recently, the courts have drawn a line between tangible and intangible assets, holding that with intangible assets there is not always a need for segregation. Certainty of objects means that it must be clear who the beneficiaries, or objects, are. The test for determining this differs {{depending on the type of}} trust; it can be that all beneficiaries must be individually identified, or that the trustees must be able to say with certainty, if a claimant comes before them, whether he is or is not a beneficiary.|$|E
2500|$|Discretionary trusts {{and powers}} in English law are {{elements}} of the English law of <b>trusts,</b> specifically of <b>express</b> <b>trusts.</b> <b>Express</b> <b>trusts</b> are trusts expressly declared by the settlor; normally this is intended, although there are situations where the settlor's intentions create a <b>trust</b> accidentally. Normal <b>express</b> <b>trusts</b> are described as [...] "fixed" [...] trusts; the trustees are obliged to distribute property, with no discretion, to the fixed number of beneficiaries. Discretionary trusts, however, are where the trustee has discretion over his actions, although he is obliged to act. The advantages of discretionary trusts are that they provide flexibility, and that the beneficiaries hold no claim to the property; as such, they cannot seek to control it, and it cannot be claimed for their debts. A power, or [...] "mere power", on the other hand, is where {{not only does the}} holder have discretion over his actions, he has discretion over whether to act in the first place.|$|R

500|$|The first {{requirement}} of an <b>express</b> <b>trust</b> is capacity; the person creating the trust must be legally {{capable of doing}} so. Generally speaking, anyone capable of holding property can form a trust, although there are exceptions. A minor cannot hold land, and therefore cannot create a trust of land; in addition, unless they are soldiers or [...] "mariners at sea", they cannot form a valid will. Where a minor tries to create a trust, it will be held voidable, and can be repudiated by him when he reaches majority, or soon after. Where the trust is clearly of detriment to the minor, the courts may decide to take it as void; the individual, when he reaches majority, could alternately plead non est factum {{if he had been}} too young to appreciate the nature of forming a trust. People who are considered mentally disordered (under the Mental Health Act 1983) and have a receiver appointed cannot have trusts directly enforced against them, as they no longer have control over their property. Where there is no receiver, the mentally disordered person's trust will be held void, unless it was made during a lucid period when the person was capable of understanding their actions. Corporations and statutory bodies only have the powers granted to them by their memorandum of association or authorising statute; if these do not authorise the creation of trusts, any such trust will be held to be ultra vires.|$|E
500|$|It is {{possible}} to create an <b>express</b> <b>trust</b> without being aware that one is doing so, {{so long as the}} court can determine from the person's intention that a beneficial entitlement should be conferred which the law (or equity) will enforce. In the Constance case, Constance was described as a man of [...] "unsophisticated character" [...] who did not know he was creating a trust‚Äì nevertheless, the courts found that was what he had done. [...] In Re Kayford, the company involved took actions to protect its customers by moving their funds into a separate bank account. Even though they had never indicated a desire to create a trust, their intention had been in line with the purpose of a trust, and thus it was considered valid. Many trusts are formed through wills, which create additional issues when determining intention. In Re Hamilton, Lindley LJ set out the standard rule that to [...] "take the will you have to construe and see what it means, and if you {{come to the conclusion that}} no trust was intended you say so"; essentially that judges should not simply assume that there is a trust. This literal approach was followed until the 1950s; since then, the judiciary have been more willing to interpret trust documents in such a way as to make the trusts valid rather than void. According to Byrnes v Kendle, the question that needs to be answered in determining whether a certainty of intention exists is [...] "What is the meaning of what the parties have said?" [...] and not [...] "What did the parties mean to say?" ...|$|E

40|$|The {{possibility}} of resolving {{the tension between}} trust as a psychological condition and trust as a general organizing principle depends on assumptions about the convergence of <b>expressed</b> and perceived <b>trust</b> relations. In empirical organizational research these assumptions are frequently left implicit and only rarely modeled directly. Using data that we have collected on trust relations within the top management team of a multiunit industrial group we specify and estimate multivariate exponential random graph models (ERGMs) that reveal important differences in the structural logics underlying networks of <b>expressed</b> and perceived <b>trust</b> relations. Results confirm that trust induces awareness and produces expectations of reciprocity [...] features {{that are consistent with}} the view of trust as a general organizing principle. Results also show that networks of perceived trust relations are characterized by tendencies toward reciprocity and generalized giving of trust. When multivariate network effects are introduced, however, <b>expressed</b> <b>trust</b> relations no longer show a significant tendency toward reciprocation. Interpreted together these results suggest that: (i) the distribution of <b>expressed</b> and perceived <b>trust</b> relations differs; (ii) <b>expressed</b> <b>trust</b> relations in organizations are more hierarchical than are perceived trust relations, and (iii) <b>expressed</b> and perceived <b>trust</b> relations need to be modeled jointly. These findings suggest caution in the adoption and interpretation of trust only as a general organizing principle, and suggest that psychological mechanisms also {{play an important role in}} the making and breaking of trust relations within organizations...|$|R

2500|$|The {{creation}} of a discretionary trust {{is different from the}} {{creation of}} any other type of <b>express</b> <b>trust,</b> due to the requirement of certainty of objects. This doctrine is that, for an <b>express</b> <b>trust</b> to be valid, the trust document must say with certainty who the beneficiaries there are. This is a problem with discretionary trusts, which can contain a class of beneficiaries rather than a list of named ones. The leading test of certainty of objects here is the [...] "any given postulant test", laid down in Re Gulbenkian. This states that the trustees must be able to say with certainty, when a potential beneficiary comes before them, that he either is or is not a beneficiary. The test was applied to discretionary trusts in McPhail v Doulton. The courts attempted to mitigate this test in Re Baden (No. 2); however, all three judges of the Court of Appeal gave separate new tests and reasons. Stamp LJ had an approach based entirely on the facts, with no greater impact on certainty of objects. Sachs LJ took the approach that the burden of proof was on the claimants to prove they were beneficiaries, not on the trustees to prove the trust was valid. Megaw LJ, however, took the approach that a trust could be valid, even with uncertain beneficiaries, if there was a [...] "core number" [...] of beneficiaries who were certain.|$|E
2500|$|Automatic {{resulting}} trusts {{arise from}} a [...] "gap" [...] in the equitable title of property. The equitable maxim [...] "equity abhors a vacuum" [...] is followed; {{it is against}} principle {{for a piece of}} property to have no owner. As such, the courts assign the property to somebody in a resulting trust to avoid this becoming an issue. Automatic resulting trusts occur where an <b>express</b> <b>trust</b> fails. This includes where there is no valid declaration of trust, where there is surplus property, or upon the dissolution of an unincorporated association. Whatever the reason, when a trust fails the property must be passed to someone. This is an application of the equitable maxim that [...] "equity abhors a vacuum".|$|E
2500|$|When non-trustees {{interfere}} with the workings of an <b>express</b> <b>trust</b> {{to such an extent}} as to harm it, they can be deemed to be [...] "constructive trustees", or trustees de son tort. In Mara v Browne, Smith LJ stated that [...] "if one, not being a trustee and not having authority from a trustee, takes upon himself to intermeddle with trust matters or to do acts characteristic of the office of trustee, he may therefore make himself what is called in law trustee of his own wrong - ie, a trustee de son tort, or, as it is also termed, a constructive trustee". For someone to be made a constructive trustee, they must have had the property in their possession or control before the application, and have acted in a dishonest or reckless way. If found liable, the constructive trust will be held to account personally to repay any loss suffered by the trust fund, and will be responsible for maintaining that trust property in his possession.|$|E

2500|$|Constructive trust: Unlike an <b>express</b> <b>trust,</b> a {{constructive}} trust is not created by {{an agreement between}} a settlor and the trustee. A constructive trust is imposed by the law as an [...] "equitable remedy". This generally occurs due to some wrongdoing, where the wrongdoer has acquired legal title to some property and cannot in good conscience be allowed to benefit from it. A constructive trust is, essentially, a legal fiction. For example, a court of equity recognizing a plaintiff's request for the equitable remedy of {{a constructive}} trust may decide that a constructive trust has been created and simply order the person holding the assets to deliver them {{to the person who}} rightfully should have them. The constructive trustee is not necessarily the person who is guilty of the wrongdoing, and in practice it is often a bank or similar organization. The distinction may be finer than the preceding exposition in that there are also said to be two forms of constructive trust, the institutional constructive trust and the remedial constructive trust. The latter is an [...] "equitable remedy" [...] imposed by law being truly remedial; the former arising due to some defect in the transfer of property.|$|E
2500|$|Resulting trusts in English law are trusts created where {{property}} is not properly disposed of. It {{comes from the}} Latin resultare, meaning to spring back, and was defined by Megarry VC as [...] "essentially a property concept; any property that a man does not effectually dispose of remains his own". These trusts come in two forms: [...] automatic resulting trusts, and presumed resulting trusts. Automatic resulting trusts arise from a [...] "gap" [...] in the equitable title of property. The equitable maxim [...] "equity abhors a vacuum" [...] is followed: it is against principle {{for a piece of}} property to have no owner. As such, the courts assign the property to somebody in a resulting trust to avoid this becoming an issue. They occur in one of four situations: where there is no declaration of trust, where an <b>express</b> <b>trust</b> fails, where there is surplus property, or upon the dissolution of an unincorporated association. Rules differ depending on the situation and the type of original trust under dispute; failed charitable trusts, for example, have the property reapplied in a different way from other forms of trust.|$|E
2500|$|Trusts {{are usually}} {{created by a}} settlor, who gives assets {{to one or more}} {{trustees}} who undertake to use the assets for beneficiaries. Like in contract law no formality is required to make a trust, except where statute demands it (e.g. transfers of land, shares, for wills). To protect the settlor, English law demands a reasonable degree of certainty that a trust was intended. To be able to enforce the trust's terms, the courts also require reasonable certainty about which assets were entrusted, and which people were meant to be the trust's beneficiaries. Unlike some offshore tax havens and the United States, English law requires that a trust has at least one beneficiary if it is not charitable. The Charity Commission monitors how charity trustees perform their duties, and ensures charities serve the public interest. Pensions and investment trusts are closely regulated to protect people's savings and ensure that trustees or fund managers are accountable. Beyond these expressly created trusts, English law recognises [...] "resulting" [...] and [...] "constructive" [...] trusts that arise by automatic operation of law to prevent unjust enrichment, to correct wrongdoing or to create property rights where intentions are unclear. Although the word [...] "trust" [...] is used, resulting and constructive trusts are different because they mainly create property-based remedies to protect people's rights, and do not merely flow (like a contract or an <b>express</b> <b>trust)</b> from the consent of the parties. Generally speaking, however, trustees owe a range of duties to their beneficiaries. If a trust document is silent, trustees must avoid any possibility of a conflict of interest, manage the trust's affairs with reasonable care and skill, and only act for purposes consistent with the trust's terms. Some of these duties can be excluded, except where the statute makes duties compulsory, but all trustees must act in good faith {{in the best interests of}} the beneficiaries. If trustees breach their duties, the beneficiaries may make a claim for all property wrongfully paid away to be restored, and may trace and follow what was trust property and claim restitution from any third party who ought to have known of the breach of trust.|$|E
