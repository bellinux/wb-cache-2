5|$|Up to January 2011, {{market prices}} for NZ Units were largely {{set by the}} {{international}} price for Certified <b>Emission</b> <b>Reduction</b> (CER) units. In March 2011, European concerns over {{the implications of the}} Fukushima nuclear disaster for their nuclear reactors reduced atomic power generation and increased coal thermal generation. This caused extra demand for CERs in the European Union Emission Trading Scheme and CER prices exceeded $NZ25 a tonne, the effective price cap in the NZ ETS. NZ buyers switched from the more expensive CERS to cheaper NZUs which were traded at a record price of more than NZ$21 per tonne. In July 2011, concerns over the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis combined with the high volumes of CERS being issued caused international CER prices to fall to a range between 9 and 10 euros. NZU prices fell to $NZ16.|$|E

40|$|Current and {{prospective}} EU members have recently proposed {{a set of}} guidelines for trade with <b>emissions</b> <b>reductions</b> within the Kyoto Protocol.

We analyze the economic effects of the European proposal in the EDGE-model, a dynamic multi-region general equilibrium model. In the short run, the proposal drives up global prices for <b>emission</b> <b>reductions,</b> because the elimination of hot air reduces the supply of <b>emission</b> <b>reductions.</b> In the longer run, the proposal drives down global prices for <b>emission</b> <b>reductions,</b> because binding import ceilings on <b>emission</b> <b>reductions,</b> reduce the demand for <b>emission</b> <b>reductions.</b> Whether compared to free Annex B or global trade, the European proposal increases global welfare costs by approximately 15 bn € (or 0. 1 percent) per year.

25|$|The Berlin mandate was {{recognized}} in the Kyoto Protocol in that developing countries were not subject to <b>emission</b> <b>reduction</b> commitments in the first Kyoto commitment period. However, the large potential for growth in developing country emissions made negotiations on this issue tense. In the final agreement, the Clean Development Mechanism was designed to limit emissions in developing countries, but {{in such a way}} that developing countries do not bear the costs for limiting emissions. The general assumption was that developing countries would face quantitative commitments in later commitment periods, and at the same time, developed countries would meet their first round commitments.|$|E
