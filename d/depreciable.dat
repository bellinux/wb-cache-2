25|$|Taxable income {{includes}} capital gains. However, {{individuals are}} taxed {{at a lower}} rate on long term capital gains and qualifying dividends (see below). A capital gain is the excess of the sales price over the tax basis (usually, the cost) of capital assets, generally those assets not held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. Capital losses (where basis is more than sales price) are deductible, but deduction for long term capital losses {{is limited to the}} total capital gains for the year, plus for individuals up to $3,000 of ordinary income ($1,500 if married filing separately). An individual may exclude $250,000 ($500,000 for a married couple filing jointly) of capital gains on the sale of the individual's primary residence, subject to certain conditions and limitations. Gains on <b>depreciable</b> property used in a business are treated as ordinary income to the extent of depreciation previously claimed.|$|E
50|$|Other {{capital gains}} are taxed at the {{ordinary}} rate. If {{the total amount}} of sales is used for the purchase of <b>depreciable</b> fixed assets within 3 years, the taxation of the capital gains will be spread over the <b>depreciable</b> period of these assets.|$|E

5000|$|Certain {{property}} {{is subject to}} depreciation. Depreciation allows one to deduct {{a certain amount of}} the value or basis of <b>depreciable</b> property per taxable year. A person with <b>depreciable</b> property must know when to start depreciating his/her property. The tax code explains how to do this through, what is called, the applicable convention.|$|E

5000|$|Many systems {{allow an}} {{additional}} deduction for {{a portion of}} the cost of <b>depreciable</b> assets acquired in the current tax year. The UK system provides a first year capital allowance of £50,000. In the United States, two such deductions are available. A deduction for the full cost of <b>depreciable</b> tangible personal property is allowed up to $500,000 through 2013. This deduction is fully phased out for businesses acquiring over $2,000,000 of such property during the year. [...] In addition, additional first year depreciation of 50% of the cost of most other <b>depreciable</b> tangible personal property is allowed as a deduction. [...] Some other systems have similar first year or accelerated allowances.|$|E
50|$|However, this {{exclusion}} {{will only}} reduce {{the basis of}} the <b>depreciable</b> real property of the taxpayer.|$|E
5000|$|For taxpayers, the half-year {{convention}} {{does not}} require knowledge or proof of the date on which <b>depreciable</b> property is placed in service. <b>Depreciable</b> property {{is assumed to be}} placed into service on July 1 of the year in which it is placed into service. The Internal Revenue Service is fond of the rule because without it, taxpayers would be tempted to buy property {{in the second half of}} the year and claim full depreciation deductions as if the property were used for the entire year. Taxpayers like the rule because it {{does not require}} them to keep track of or prove exactly when <b>depreciable</b> property was placed into service. Nonetheless, the IRS is wary of abuse of the half-year convention. Under § 168(d)(3) of the Federal Income Tax Code, if a taxpayer purchases a lot of <b>depreciable</b> assets in the last three months of the taxable year, they may be forced to use the less beneficial [...] "mid-quarter convention". This convention treats such property as placed into service in the midpoint of the last quarter of the taxable year. See § 168(d)(4)(c).|$|E
50|$|Section 280F {{was enacted}} to limit certain {{deductions}} on <b>depreciable</b> assets. To put 280F in context a general understanding of 167(a) and 179 is useful.|$|E

50|$|Exchanges of {{personal}} property (vehicles, equipment, intellectual property rights) {{are subject to}} more restrictive rules than exchanges of real property, as set forth by Treasury Regulation § 1.1031(a)-2. <b>Depreciable</b> personal property is generally considered like-kind to other <b>depreciable</b> personal property that has the same “General Asset Class” in assigning class lives for purposes of depreciation. For intangible property (and personal property not subject to depreciation), the more general test of “nature or character” applies. While livestock can qualify for like-kind exchange treatment, livestock of different sexes will not qualify as like-kind.|$|E
50|$|Under {{a capital}} lease, the lessee does not record rent as an expense. Instead, the rent is {{reclassified}} as interest and obligation payments, similarly to a mortgage (with the interest calculated each rental period on the outstanding obligation balance). At the same time, the asset is depreciated. If the lease has an ownership transfer or bargain purchase option, the <b>depreciable</b> {{life is the}} asset's economic life; otherwise, the <b>depreciable</b> life is the lease term. Over {{the life of the}} lease, the interest and depreciation combined will be equal to the rent payments.|$|E
50|$|Many tax systems {{prescribe}} longer <b>depreciable</b> {{lives for}} buildings and land improvements. Such lives may vary {{by type of}} use. Many such systems, including the United States and Canada, permit depreciation for real property using only the straight line method, or a small fixed percentage of cost. Generally, no depreciation tax deduction is allowed for bare land. In the United States, residential rental buildings are <b>depreciable</b> over a 27.5 year or 40 year life, other buildings over a 39 or 40 year life, and land improvements over a 15 or 20 year life, all using the straight line method.|$|E

50|$|Sum-of-years-digits is a {{depreciation}} method {{that results in}} a more accelerated write-off than the straight line method, and typically also more accelerated than the declining balance method. Under this method the annual depreciation is determined by multiplying the <b>depreciable</b> cost by a schedule of fractions.|$|E
50|$|Accountants also {{distinguish}} {{personal property}} from real property because personal property can be depreciated faster than improvements (while land is not <b>depreciable</b> at all). It is an owner's {{right to get}} tax benefits for chattel, and there are businesses that specialize in appraising personal property, or chattel.|$|E

50|$|Under current law, small {{businesses}} may expense up to $100,000 of investments in <b>depreciable</b> assets. The deduction phases out dollar-for dollar {{to the extent}} the business's annual investments exceed $400,000. Without action, the expensing limit would have declined to $25,000 and the phase-out threshold would decline to $200,000 after 2007.|$|E
50|$|The {{bill would}} amend the Internal Revenue Code to extend through taxable years {{beginning}} before 2017: (1) the increase to $500,000 of the expensing allowance for business assets, including computer software; and (2) {{the treatment of}} qualified real property (i.e., leasehold improvement property, restaurant property, and retail improvement property) as <b>depreciable</b> business property.|$|E
50|$|Under Section 179, a {{taxpayer}} may elect to expense (deduct) all or {{a portion of}} the cost of the <b>depreciable</b> property purchased during the taxable year if it was intended to have a business use, despite generally having to capitalize this property. However, Section 280F was enacted to limit these deductions on certain listed property.|$|E
5000|$|In case of {{land and}} buildings, {{revaluation}} is desirable as their value generally increases over time, and is carried out every 3 to 5 years. In case of plant & machinery, revaluation is carried out only {{if there is a}} strong case for it. In case of <b>depreciable</b> assets such as vehicles, furniture & fittings or office equipment, revaluation is not carried out.|$|E
50|$|Frank Lyon Company v. United States, 435 U.S. 561 (1978), was a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court held that the title owner that {{acquired}} <b>depreciable</b> real estate as if the owner were a mere conduit or agent was indeed the owner and, for Federal income tax purposes, had the legal right to take tax deductions associated with depreciation on the building.|$|E
5000|$|An {{applicable}} convention, {{as presented}} in [...] of the United States Internal Revenue Code, is an assumption about when property is placed into service. It {{is used to}} determine when property depreciation begins. The purpose of applicable conventions is to simplify depreciation {{because they do not}} require a taxpayer to prove to the IRS when every piece of <b>depreciable</b> property was placed into service.|$|E
50|$|The {{composite}} {{method is}} applied to a collection of assets that are not similar, and have different service lives. For example, computers and printers are not similar, but both {{are part of the}} office equipment. Depreciation on all assets is determined by using the straight-line-depreciation method.Composite life equals the total <b>depreciable</b> cost divided by the total depreciation per year.$5,900 / $1,300 = 4.5 years.|$|E
50|$|In an {{economics}} context, land development is also sometimes advertised as land improvement or land amelioration. It refers to investments making land more usable by humans. For accounting purposes {{it refers to}} any variety of projects that increase {{the value of the}} property. Most are <b>depreciable,</b> but some land improvements are not able to be depreciated because a useful life cannot be determined. Home building and containment are two of the most common and the oldest types of development.|$|E
5000|$|... 1231 Property is a {{category}} of property defined in section 1231 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. 1231 property includes <b>depreciable</b> property and real property (e.g. buildings and equipment) used in a trade or business and held {{for more than one}} year. Some types of livestock, coal, timber and domestic iron ore are also included. It does not include: inventory; property held for sale in the ordinary course of business; artistic creations held by their creator; or, government publications.|$|E

50|$|Gain or loss may be {{deferred}} or recognized on {{retirement of}} assets under MACRS, at the taxpayer's election. Under default rules, proceeds from disposing of a <b>depreciable</b> asset in a multiple asset account {{are recognized as}} ordinary income, and depreciation on the account is unaffected by the retirement. An optional method allows the asset {{to be removed from}} the account {{at the start of the}} year from retirement, in which case gain or loss is on the asset is subject to regular rules.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Depreciable</b> {{property}} {{that is not}} eligible for a section 179 deduction is still deductible {{over a number of}} years through MACRS depreciation according to sections 167 and 168. The 179 election is optional, and the eligible property may be depreciated according to sections 167 and 168 if preferable for tax reasons. Further, the 179 election may be made only for the year the equipment is placed in use and is waived if not taken for that year. [...] However, if the election is made, it is irrevocable unless special permission is given.|$|E
