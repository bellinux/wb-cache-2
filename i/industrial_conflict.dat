25|$|The postwar years, however, saw renewed <b>industrial</b> <b>conflict,</b> {{culminating}} in the 1949 coal strike, largely fomented by the Communist Party of Australia, which crippled the state's industry. This contributed to {{the defeat of the}} Chifley government at the 1949 elections {{and the beginning of the}} long rule at a Federal level of Robert Menzies, a politician from Victoria, of the newly founded Liberal Party of Australia. The postwar years also saw massive immigration to Australia, begun by Chifley's Immigration Minister, Arthur Calwell, and continued under the Liberals. Sydney, hitherto an almost entirely British and Irish city by origin (apart from a small Chinese community), became increasingly multi-cultural, with many immigrants from Italy, Greece, Malta and eastern Europe (including many Jews), and later from Lebanon and Vietnam, permanently changing its character.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} {{motivated}} by {{the low level of}} intelligence of the remote factors responsible for conflicts and the nature of unorganized protests by individuals in the Nigerian banking sector. The dwindling government commitment to social services, anti-working class policies of the government, the nature of labour laws, failure to recognize good industrial relations practices, lack of trained personnel in Human resources management, relegation of the advice of trained personnel in industrial relations, the use of management prerogative as sword, threat to security of tenure, improper handling of intra-union disputes, physical environment of the work place, and separatist negotiation are some of the remote causes of <b>industrial</b> <b>conflicts.</b> There is a relationship between the remote causes of industrial action and unorganized protests by individuals. The identified remote causes of conflicts trigger unorganized protests by individuals. Managers are yet to acknowledge unorganized protests by individuals, like frauds, absenteeism, high labour turnover {{as an integral part of}} industrial action. The present failure by managers to focus on the remote causes of <b>industrial</b> <b>conflicts</b> and unorganized protests by individuals will not promote industrial peace. To achieve an enduring industrial peace, the remote factors which are responsible for <b>industrial</b> <b>conflicts</b> and unorganized protest by individuals must attract adequate attention...|$|R

2500|$|The Act {{followed}} the Report of the Royal Commission on Trade Unions and Employers’ Associations, led by Lord Donovan, {{which sought to}} reduce <b>industrial</b> <b>conflict</b> and introduce a claim for unfair dismissal.

25|$|The first Tanganyikan trade union, the Motor Drivers' Union, {{was founded}} in 1927. In 1937, Asian workers founded the Asiatic Labour Union, leading to the {{founding}} of numerous unions in the country. These early organizations were not, however, involved in many <b>industrial</b> <b>conflicts,</b> their primary activity being the organizing of mutual help among its members.|$|R
50|$|Each {{of these}} <b>industrial</b> <b>conflicts</b> {{was seen as}} a demoralising blow for the labour movement.

40|$|The study {{examined}} empirically {{the factors that}} influence <b>industrial</b> <b>conflicts</b> in Nigeria during the period 1980 - 2010. Earlier studies have isolated the economic and non-economic determinants of conflict in developing countries but the impacts of the identified factors have not been estimated The work attempted to bridge the gaps that exist between the theoretical and empirical analyses. The study employed simultaneous equation model techniques (SEMT) in which strikes and wage rates were made endogenous. As a descriptive study which made use of three research questions and three hypotheses, 400 staff across six selected companies in the six geo-political zones of Nigeria, after stratification, were chosen randomly through simple random techniques. Secondary data were obtained from the Federal Ministry of Labour, Employment and Productivity, Lagos and the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) Lagos. Results show that changes in wage rate, price expectation and union membership concentration influence <b>industrial</b> <b>conflicts</b> in Nigeria. Also the simultaneous equation model revealed that wages were significantly affected by strikes activity. Strike activities were not affected by wages only during the period under stud...|$|R
2500|$|In 1913 {{he became}} a {{full-time}} organiser with the Trade Union Federation and almost immediately was plunged into the greatest <b>industrial</b> <b>conflict</b> ever experienced in Southern Africa. From May to July 1913 {{as secretary of the}} Strike Committee he was the leader of the strike that started at the Kleinfontein Mine east of Johannesburg and soon escalated to a Transvaal-wide industrial revolt (of white workers). In June Bain led efforts to initiate sympathy strikes at various neighbouring mines and on the 20th was arrested on a charge of 'incitement to strike'. He was released on bail and on 29 June a general strike was called.|$|E
2500|$|These {{policies}} {{had a major}} structural {{effect on}} the city's economy. While government policy had limited success in preventing the growth of Birmingham's existing industries, {{it was much more}} successful in preventing new industries establishing themselves in the city. Birmingham's economic success over the previous two centuries had been built on its economic diversity and its ongoing ability to adapt and innovate – attracting new businesses and developing new industries with its large supply of skilled labour and dynamic entrepreneurial culture – but this was exactly the process that government industrial location policy sought to prevent. Birmingham's existing industries grew strongly and kept the economy buoyant, but growing local fears that the city's economy was becoming over-specialised were dismissed by central government, even though danger signs were growing by the early 1970s. In 1950 Birmingham's economy could still be described as [...] "more broadly based than that of any city of equivalent size in the world", but by 1973 the West Midlands had an above-average reliance on large firms for employment, and the small firms that remained were increasingly dependent as suppliers and sub-contractors to the few larger firms. The [...] "City of [...] Thousand Trades" [...] had become over-specialised on one industry – the motor trade – much of which by the 1970s had itself consolidated into a single company – British Leyland. Trade union organisation grew and the motor industry in particular saw industrial disputes from the 1950s onwards. A city that for most of its history had a reputation for weak trade unionism and strong cooperation between workers and management, developed a reputation for trade union militancy and <b>industrial</b> <b>conflict.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{was rarely}} unkind to Saxon; but, {{on the other}} hand he was rarely kind. His {{attitude}} toward her was growing negative. He was disinterested. Despite the fight for the union she was enduring with him, putting up with him shoulder to shoulder, she occupied but little space in his mind. When he acted toward her gently, she could see that it was merely mechanical, just as she was well aware that the endearing terms he used, the endearing caresses he gave, were only habitual. The spontaneity and warmth had gone out. Often, when he was not in liquor, flashes of the old Billy came back, but even such flashes dwindled in frequency. He was growing preoccupied, moody. Hard times and the bitter stresses of <b>industrial</b> <b>conflict</b> strained him. Especially was this apparent in his sleep, when he suffered paroxysms of lawless dreams, groaning and muttering, clenching his fists, grinding his teeth, twisting with muscular tensions, his face writhing with passions and violences, his throat guttering with terrible curses that rasped and aborted on his lips. And Saxon, lying beside him, afraid of this visitor to her bed whom she did not know, remembered what Mary had told her of Bert. He, too, had cursed and clenched his fists, in his nights fought out the battles of his days.|$|E
50|$|Despite its {{peripheral}} role in Australian {{politics and}} its ultimate failure, the Communist Party had an influence far beyond its numbers. From 1935 to the 1960s it occupied leadership positions {{in a number}} of important trade unions, and was at centre of many major <b>industrial</b> <b>conflicts.</b> Many of its members played leading roles in Australian cultural life, such as the novelists Katharine Susannah Prichard, Judah Waten, Frank Hardy, Eric Lambert and Alan Marshall, the painter Noel Counihan and the poet David Martin.|$|R

40|$|The {{debate over}} labour market {{regulations}} in India is highly polarised. Advocates of labour market deregulation {{suggest that the}} labour law framework in the country confers disproportionate powers on workers and trade unions in the formal sector of the economy, resulting in <b>industrial</b> <b>conflicts</b> and poor productivity. Using workplace union survey data {{from the state of}} Maharashtra, this paper examines the veracity of these claims. Maharashtra is recognised as a state with a broadly pro-worker labour law framework. We find that even pro-worker labour laws at best offer only weak protection to workers and unions in the formal sector establishments. Unions find themselves increasingly vulnerable to employer hostility. We discuss these findings {{in the context of the}} role of state and judiciary in employment relations and of union links with political parties...|$|R

40|$|During the Affaire Dreyfus, {{the socialist}} leader Alexandre Millerand was {{appointed}} Minister of Commerce. Between 1899 and 1902, he instigated crucial social reforms, {{such as the}} limitation of working day or the compulsory arbitration of <b>industrial</b> <b>conflicts.</b> However, his action has been under-estimated by historians of socialism and historians of social reform. On the one hand, Millerand’s governmental experience is considered as a pivotal break leading to {{the foundation of a}} unified socialist party, neglecting his intellectual coherence. On the other hand, his action is a mere step in the definition of the Third Republic social policy, ignoring the specificity of his socialist convictions. This article aims at examining the Minister’s ideas and practices, by understanding his conception of social reform in the contradicting intellectual and political context of Republican « nébuleuses réformatrices » and socialist reformism. These contradictions are at work in Millerand’s projects...|$|R
5000|$|In 1924, Campbell {{moved to}} London to become acting {{editor of the}} CPGB's Workers' Weekly newspaper.

5000|$|In this context, <b>industrial</b> <b>conflicts</b> in {{the early}} 1960s became more intense, {{especially}} in the south-west of Germany. Engineering industry employers began to professionalise their own confederations {{in order to be}} able to match the trades union organisations. Herbert van Hüllen took over at the head of the metal and electrical employers' confederation in 1961, representing a younger generation on the management side, eager to apply a more confrontational interpretation of the industrialists' interests. The same went for Hanns Martin Schleyer who in 1962 took over at the [...] "Association of Württemberger-Baden Metal-based Industrialists" [...] ("Verband WürttembergischBadischer Metallindustrieller" [...] / VMI). Schleyer, who would go on to lead the Confederation of German Employers' Associations ("Bundesvereinigung der Deutschen Arbeitgeberverbände" [...] / BDA), now found himself as Bleicher's counterpart on the management side for wage negotiations in the largest of the three wage zones in the south-west: North Württemberg / North Baden.|$|R
