40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the growth {{analysis}} of Johnsongrass susceptible and resistant to the ACCase and ALS inhibitors.

It tries to determinate the possible fitness cost that is linked to the resistance to a specific group of <b>weed</b> <b>killers</b> in Johnsongrass. As these plants came from different European countries, they grew in different environments and cultivations. 10 populations of Johsongrass have been used; they were studied from 2005 to 2009. Johnsongrass resistant to ACCasi inhibitors were treated with Fusilade Max; Johnsongrass resistant to ALS inhibitors were treated with Ghibli. On the other hand the susceptible plants were no treated. Steams, leafs, roots and ears were measured 4 times during their life cycles. The outcomes have been reported in graphics. Finally, the growth and allometric analysis have underlined the dissimilar productivity among the three different plants...|$|R
30|$|Thus, the {{activity}} of plant root, soil fauna and fungi increased following the long-term cessation of use of chemical fertiliser, pesticides and <b>weed</b> <b>killers</b> and deep tillage and the input mulch in UFs. These biological activities probably promote the development of soil structure from surface soil to subsoil and increase ESD. Therefore, these developments of soil structure and ESD improve the productivity of UFs on andosols in Japan.|$|R

It has a low permanence and because of employment of this herbicide for prevailing of weeds in agricultural fields, large quantities find their way into water bodies.
