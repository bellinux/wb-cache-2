6000|$|The only {{information}} that reaches us concerning outward events appears {{to pass through}} the avenue of our senses; and the more perceptive the senses are of difference, the larger is the field upon which our judgment and intelligence can act. Sensation mounts through a series of grades of [...] "just perceptible differences." [...] It starts from the zero of consciousness, and it becomes more intense as the stimulus increases (though at a slower rate) up to the point when the stimulus is so strong as to begin to damage the nerve apparatus. It then yields place to pain, which is another form of sensation, and which continues until the nerve apparatus is destroyed. Two persons may be equally able just to hear the same faint sound, and they may equally begin to be pained by the same loud sound, and yet they may differ as to the number of intermediate grades of sensation. The grades will be less numerous as the organisation is of a lower order, and the keenest sensation possible to it will in consequence be less intense. An artist who is capable of discriminating more differences of tint than another man is not necessarily more capable of seeing clearly in twilight, or more or less intolerant of sunshine. A musician is not necessarily able to hear very faint sounds, nor to be more startled by loud sounds than others are.

Approach: The samples used in research were 72 of seventh grade students in the first semester of academic year 2009 at Koratpittayakom School, Muang District, Nakhonratchasima Province. The sample groups were divided into two groups by assignment for socioscientific issues-based classroom and conventional classroom. The research instruments used in this research were twelve plans for organization learning activities using socioscientific issues-based instruction and conventional instruction, an achievement test with <b>discriminating</b> <b>powers</b> (B) its ranging was 0. 27 - 0. 68 and reliability was 0. 85, difficulty) P (ranging of analytical thinking test was 0. 53 - 0. 77 with <b>discriminating</b> <b>powers</b> ranging, 0. 78 - 0. 30 its reliability was 0. 78 and <b>discriminating</b> <b>powers)</b> B (ranging 0. 31 - 0. 58, moral reasoning test had reliability 0. 85.

Students were divided into 2 groups, 44 students each. The research instruments used in the study were lesson plans for organization of project-based and inquiry-based learning activities, 8 plans each; a 30 -item 4 -choice science learning achievement test with <b>discriminating</b> <b>powers</b> ranging 0. 28 - 0. 46 and a reliability of 0. 86; a 20 -item 4 -choice science process skill test with difficulties (P) ranging 0. 36 - 0. 68, <b>discriminating</b> <b>powers</b> ranging 0. 38 - 0. 72 and a reliability of 0. 82 and a 20 -item 4 -choice analytical thinking test with difficulties (P) ranging 0. 44 - 0. 67, <b>discriminating</b> <b>powers</b> ranging 0. 32 - 0. 81 and a reliability 0. 76. Hotelling T 2 was employed for testing hypotheses. Results: The plans for organization of project-based and inquiry-based learning activities in the science learning had efficiencies 89. 05 / 78. 79 of project-based learning and 87. 58 / 78. 64 of inquiry-based learning in respectively. The plans for organization of project-based and inquiry-based learning activities had effectiveness indices 0. 6774 of project-based learning and 0. 6781 of inquiry-based learning in respectively. Students who learned using the plans for organization of project-based learning activities and those who learned using the plans for organization of inquiry-based learning activities did not have different learning achievement, science process skills and analytical thinking (p> 0. 05). Conclusion: In conclusion, the plans for organization of project-based and inquiry-based learning activities were appropriately efficient and effective. The students in 2 groups did not show different learning achievement, science process skills and analytical thinking.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we propose several sets of new {{features}} for protein fold prediction. The first feature set consisting of 47 features uses only the sequence information. We also define four different sets of features based on hydrophobicity of amino acids. Each such set has 400 features which are motivated by folding energy modeling. To define these features we have considered pair-wise amino acids (AA) interaction potential. The effectiveness of the proposed feature sets is tested using multilayer perceptron and {{radial basis function networks}} to solve the 4 class (level 1) and 27 class (level 2) prediction problems as defined in the context of SCOP classification. Our investigation shows that such features have good <b>discriminating</b> <b>powers</b> in predicting protein folds. ...|$|R
40|$|Higher-order languages, whose {{paradigmatic}} {{example is}} the lambda-calculus, are languages with powerful operators {{that are capable of}} manipulating and exchanging programs themselves. This thesis studies behavioral equivalences for programs with higher-order and probabilistic features. Behavioral equivalence is formalized as a contextual, or testing, equivalence, and two main lines of research are pursued in the thesis. The first part of the thesis focuses on contextual equivalence as a way of investigating the expressiveness of different languages. The <b>discriminating</b> <b>powers</b> offered by higher-order concurrent languages (Higher-Order pi-calculi) are compared with those offered by higher-order sequential languages (à la lambda-calculus) and by first-order concurrent languages (à la CCS). The comparison is carried out by examining the contextual equivalences induced by the languages on two classes of first-order processes, namely nondeterministic and probabilistic processes. As a result, the spectrum of the <b>discriminating</b> <b>powers</b> of several varieties of higher-order and first-order languages is obtained, both in a nondeterministic and in a probabilistic setting. The second part of the thesis is devoted to proof techniques for contextual equivalence in probabilistic lambda-calculi. Bisimulation-based proof techniques are studied, with particular focus on deriving bisimulations that are fully abstract for contextual equivalence (i. e., coincide with it). As a first result, full abstraction of applicative bisimilarity and similarity are proved for a call-by-value probabilistic lambda-calculus with a parallel disjunction operator. Applicative bisimulations are however known not to scale to richer languages. Hence, more robust notions of bisimulations for probabilistic calculi are considered, in the form of environmental bisimulations. Environmental bisimulations are defined for pure call-by-name and call-by-value probabilistic lambda-calculi, and for a (call-by-value) probabilistic lambda-calculus extended with references (i. e., a store). In each case, full abstraction results are derived...|$|R
50|$|The gross body is {{equipped}} with five sense organs (viz. ears, skin, eyes, tongue and nose) to receive sensations of sound, touch, form, taste and odour and five organs of actions (viz. tongue, hands, feet, genital and anus) to perform the functions of speech, grasp, motion, reproduction and excretion. In addition, there are four inner organs, viz. mind, intellect, Chitta and ego. Of these fourteen organs mind is the most important, since it activates and controls all other organs it is the mind through which {{the consciousness of the}} soul flows in different organs of the body. The intellect is endowed with <b>discriminating</b> <b>power.</b> The memories of past actions and various desires and tendencies of the soul are impressed on the Chitta. The ego is responsible for the constant feeling of 'I am the doer' in all actions that one performs. To provide energy to the body and its various organs for their proper functioning, five life forces, called Pranas act incessantly in the body. These life forces are Prana (respiration), Vyana (blood circulation), Samana (digestion), Apana (excretion) and Udana. The last one provides the energy for transplanting the subtle body in the mother's womb and also for separating the, subtle body from the gross body at the end of life.

40|$|AbstractÐIn this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{approach}} to combine multiple features in handwriting recognition based on two ideas: feature selection-based combination and class-dependent features. A nonparametric method is used for feature evaluation, and {{the first part of this}} paper is devoted to the evaluation of features in terms of their class separation and recognition capabilities. In the second part, multiple feature vectors are combined to produce a new feature vector. Based on the fact that a feature has different <b>discriminating</b> <b>powers</b> for different classes, a new scheme of selecting and combining class-dependent features is proposed. In this scheme, a class is considered to have its own optimal feature vector for discriminating itself from the other classes. Using an architecture of modular neural networks as the classifier, a series of experiments were conducted on unconstrained handwritten numerals. The results indicate that the selected features are effective in separating pattern classes and the new feature vector derived from a combination of two types of such features further improves the recognition rate.

40|$|Summary: Galactosyl hydroxylysine and deoxypyridinoline are {{at present}} the most {{promising}} markers of bone resorption. Various studies have indeed shown that these two markers discriminate with high accuracy subjects with different rates of bone turnover and that their accuracies and <b>discriminate</b> <b>power</b> are very similar. The aim {{of this paper is}} to compare the practicality and the reproducibility of the HPLC galactosyl hydroxylysine and deoxypyridinoline assays. In summary, this review shows that the galactosyl hydroxylysine and deoxypyridinoline HPLC assays differ mainly in the need, in using deoxypyridinoline, for an acid hydrolysis and a preextraction of the urine samples. This implies two major problems for deoxypyridinoline: 1) more time is required due to the cumbersome preanalytical procedures; and 2) a lower reproducibility. Our data, in fact, show that both the intra-assay and inter-assay coefficient of variation of the deoxypyridinoline assay are almost 100 % higher than those of the galactosyl hydroxylysine assay.
