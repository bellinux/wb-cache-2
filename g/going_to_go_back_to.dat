[...] Whitney Pastorek of Entertainment Weekly did not care for Jack's flashbacks, but commended the scene in which Jack saved Charlie, stating [...] "even though I knew he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the CPR and save Charlie's life, I started crying.

500|$|Blumenauer {{referred}} to the Trump administration in his speech, saying, [...] "We have failed {{in the political process}} because they've made science partisan. They've undermined the credibility and confidence that people have, for example in science, dealing with climate." [...] He also spoke about the importance of evidence-based decision making. In her speech, Bonamici said science should not be a partisan issue, and told the crowd: [...] "We are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Washington, D.C., with all of you in our mind [...] this beautiful sea of science supporters, and fight for research, fight for science, fight for clean air, fight for clean water, and fight for our planet. So stay engaged, please. This is just the beginning." ...|$|E
500|$|Tubman {{also carried}} a revolver, {{and was not}} afraid to use it. The gun afforded some {{protection}} from the ever-present slave catchers and their dogs; however, she also purportedly threatened to shoot any escaped slave who tried to turn back on the journey since that would threaten {{the safety of the}} remaining group. Tubman told the tale of one man who insisted he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the plantation when morale got low among a group of fugitive slaves. She pointed the gun at his head and said, [...] "You go on or die." [...] Several days later, he was with the group as they entered the United Province of Canada.|$|E

500|$|It was '97 and I {{was leaving}} my {{marriage}} [...] which encompassed my life. I was writing the song 'Butterfly' wishing that that's {{what he would}} say to me. There's a part that goes, 'I have learned that beauty/has to flourish in the light/wild horses run unbridled/or their spirit dies/you have given me the courage/to be all that I can/and I truly feel ... and I truly feel your heart will lead you back to me when you're ready to land.' At that point I really believed that I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the marriage – I didn't think I was going to leave forever. But then the things that happened to me during that time caused me to not go back. Had it been, 'Go be yourself, you've been with me since you were a kid, let's separate for a while,' I probably would've." ...|$|E

500|$|Reactions to the {{transmissions}} were mixed, {{triggering a}} media debate concerning the ethical implications of mixing rock entertainment with human tragedy. The Edge said, [...] "A lot of nights {{it felt like}} quite an abrupt interruption that was probably not particularly welcomed {{by a lot of}} people in the audience. You were grabbed out of a rock concert and given a really strong dose of reality and it was quite hard sometimes to get back to something as frivolous as a show having watched five or ten minutes of real human suffering." [...] Mullen worried that the band were exploiting the Bosnians' suffering for entertainment. In 2002, he said, [...] "I can't remember anything more excruciating than those Sarajevo link-ups. It was like throwing a bucket of cold water over everybody. You could see your audience going, 'What the fuck are these guys doing?' But I'm proud to have been a part of a group who were trying to do something." [...] During a transmission for the band's concert at Wembley Stadium, three women in Sarajevo told Bono via satellite, [...] "We know you're not going to do anything for us. You're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> a rock show. You're going to forget that we even exist. And we're all going to die." [...] Some people close to the band joined the War Child charity project, including Brian Eno. Writer Bill Flanagan believes that the link-ups accomplished Bono's goal for Zoo TV of [...] "illustrating onstage the obscenity of idly flipping from a war on CNN to rock videos on MTV". U2 vowed to perform in Sarajevo someday, eventually fulfilling this commitment on their 1997 PopMart Tour.|$|E

500|$|Reactions to the {{transmissions}} were mixed. Many fans {{felt the}} transmissions disrupted {{the flow of}} the concerts. Most of the British press was highly critical. One writer for NME wrote, [...] "The Bosnian linkup was beyond bad taste. It was insulting." [...] Bono thought that they were bringing the public's attention to an important event, though he admitted that the link-ups were the most difficult thing the band had done in their career. Guitarist The Edge said, [...] "We don't normally see that kind of cold hard news. We get a very sanitized, editorialized take on everything... When you watch the television news, you are getting something palatable, whereas this was really quite unpalatable most of the time. And for that reason I think it affected people very much, including us." [...] Mullen worried that the band were exploiting the Bosnians' suffering for entertainment. During a transmission from the band's concert at Wembley Stadium, three women in Sarajevo asked what the band intended to do to help before telling Bono, [...] "We know you're {{not going to do anything}} for us. You're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> a rock show. You're going to forget that we even exist. And we're all going to die." [...] During a transmission to a Glasgow concert, a Bosnian woman told the concert audience, [...] "We would like to hear the music, too, but we hear only the screams of wounded and tortured people and raped women." [...] Some people were upset by the circumstances of Sarajevo and were motivated to join the War Child charity project, including U2 producer Brian Eno. Despite U2's obligation to the tour and their inability to perform in Sarajevo during the war, they vowed to play the city someday.|$|E
2500|$|... about {{claiming}} the passionate aspect of womanhood {{that the church}} teaches is wrong, [...] "the idea of speaking my truth, no censorship, {{in a place that}} did not honor anyone's truth unless it was the church's truth," [...] "so I figured if I was going to claim my womanhood, my passion, and sing this record - which, for me, was claiming fragments that I had suppressed for a long time - then I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> a church, back to the old world, to do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'm {{going to}} change, now," [...] said Newman. [...] "I don't mean that I {{am going to}} be indelicate; but I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> where I began. I AM back there. I have been all round the circle. Or rather, I have never been away from here. I have never ceased to want what I wanted then. Only now I am more sure of it, if possible; I am more sure of myself, and more sure of you. I know you better, though I don't know {{anything}} I didn't believe three months ago. You are everything--you are beyond everything--I can imagine or desire. You know me now; you MUST know me. I won't say that you have seen the best--but you have seen the worst. I hope you have been thinking all this while. You must have seen that I was only waiting; you can't suppose that I was changing. What will you say to me, now? Say that everything is clear and reasonable, and that I have been very patient and considerate, and deserve my reward. And then give me your hand. Madame de Cintre do that. Do it." ...|$|E

5000|$|According to {{campaign}} manager Rick Davis, Palin thought the questions would be softer than they were: [...] "She {{was under the}} impression the Couric thing was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be easier than it was. Everyone's guard was down for the Couric interview." [...] "I knew it didn't go well the first day, and then we gave her a couple of other segments after that," [...] Palin said in a retrospective with conservative filmmaker John Ziegler on the Couric interview. [...] "My question to the campaign was, after it didn't go well the first day, why were we <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> for more? Because of however it works in that upper echelon of power brokering, in the media and with spokespersons, it was told to me, yeah, we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> for more. And going back for more was not a wise decision, either." ...|$|R
6000|$|Saxton laughed. [...] "I've met {{quite a few}} Englishmen--of your kind--already," [...] he said. [...] "That's why I {{feel that}} when you've taken my dollars you're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> on me without giving me warning. Besides, Devine would be {{considerably}} more likely to fix you up in quite another way. Now, I want an answer. Is it a deal?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Outgoing Prime Minister Hubert Ingraham {{announced}} his retirement from politics following the defeat of his Free National Movement (FNM). He had served in Parliament for thirty-five years, winning re-election seven times, including 2012. Ingraham told supporters, [...] "I gave it the best I could and now I've been rejected by the public of the Bahamas...We had no indication from the general public they would go that way." [...] Ingraham then confirmed his retirement, saying, [...] "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my little law office and enjoy life with my family." ...|$|E
50|$|Following residency, Bowman {{served as}} chair of {{pathology}} at Provident Hospital. He was drafted again and spent 1953 to 1955 as chief of pathology for the Medical Nutrition Laboratory at Fitzsimons Army Hospital in Aurora, Colorado. After leaving the military Bowman decided to move overseas. “My wife and I decided {{that we were not}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> anything that smacked of segregation,” he recalled. He became chair of pathology at Nemazee Hospital in Shiraz, Iran. “We were recently married, so we took a chance,” he said. “It changed our lives completely.” Their daughter, Valerie, was born in Iran.|$|E
5000|$|Joel {{stated that}} people in Los Angeles, {{including}} former New Yorkers, were deriding New York for its troubles. Joel says he thought, [...] "If New York's {{going to go down}} the tubes, I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> New York." [...] He explains that the song depicts the apocalypse occurring in New York, [...] "the skyline tumbling down, this horrendous conflagration happening in New York City." [...] Joel stated that the song is titled [...] "Miami 2017" [...] because many New Yorkers retire to Miami and the narrator is telling his grandchildren in the year 2017 about what he saw in the destruction of New York.|$|E

5000|$|The tapes include conversations {{related to}} the issues of arrest quotas and investigations. Schoolcraft says an overemphasis on arrests leads to {{wrongful}} arrests and bad police work. A recording from 31 October 2009 includes precinct commander Steven Mauriello ordering a raid on 120 Chauncy St.: “Everybody goes. I don’t care. You’re on 120 Chauncey and they’re popping champagne? Yoke ’em. Put them through the system. They got bandannas on, arrest them. Everybody goes tonight. They’re underage? Fuck it.” He orders: [...] "Bring 'em in. Lodge them.

5000|$|The {{trial court}} refused to include Form 10-K {{as a part}} of the {{evidence}} citing its irrelevance as unnecessary in the case put against the jury.

They're confusing. I think to give context you have to give them more than they possibly need. The experts relied on them. They testified from them. So for the record, that evidence that you need, if you're talking about four pillars of whatever it is, it's all here anyway. So, I'm going to deny that." ...|$|E
