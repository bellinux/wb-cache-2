40|$|The rapid {{development}} and adoption {{of information and}} communication technologies (ICTs), especially the vast proliferation of Internet and Web 2. 0 paradigm in the recent years, have profoundly transformed the traditional ways of doing businesses worldwide. Going virtual has offered the companies many new possibilities, but it has also revealed many potential obstacles that have imposed new business strategies. Beyond any doubt, creating satisfied <b>e-Customers,</b> who will generate more <b>e-Customers,</b> is the best business strategy of all for online companies. Satisfied <b>e-Customers</b> are the key premise to attracting new <b>e-Customers</b> and then retaining them on a long term, the two most important aspects of doing business online. In that context, the paper highlights some results of an online survey, conducted among college students in the Republic of Macedonia, regarding their perceived levels of satisfaction vis-à-vis their B 2 C e-Commerce purchasing experiences. The statistical analysis of the survey results is based on the appliance of elements of descriptive and inferential statistics, as well as linear correlation and factor analysis. As such, the aim of the paper is to provide a profound knowledge and understanding of how Macedonian college students evaluate their online shopping experiences...|$|R
40|$|Contemporary ways {{of doing}} {{business}} are heavily dependent on the e-Commerce/e-Business paradigm. The highest priority of an e-Commerce Web site's management is to assure pertinent Quality-of-Service (QoS) levels of their Web services continually, {{in order to keep}} the potential <b>e-Customers</b> satisfied. Otherwise, it faces an immense possibility of losing both <b>e-Customers</b> and revenues, along with a big possibility of gaining bad reputation due to either poor performance or unavailability of the e-Commerce Web site. In order to avoid numerous unpleasant consequences, by designing and implementing e-Commerce Web sites that will always meet <b>e-Customer's</b> high expectations, a relevant performance models have to be utilized to obtain appropriate performance metrics. A continuous assessment of current performances and especially predicting future needs are the subjects of capacity planning methodologies. Within this paper, such a predictive model has been described and evaluated by using discrete-event simulation of both the client-side and server-side processes involved. In addition, the paper discusses the performance metrics obtained as a function of the intensity and quality of the workload parameters. Comment: 10 pages, 5 figures, 5 table...|$|R

40|$|The Internet and the World Wide Web {{have opened}} the door to new models linking the online {{customer}} (<b>e-customer)</b> to the online business (e-business). The key to this relationship is the e-business's Web site. The personal computer (PC) screen images or Web interfaces seen by the <b>e-customer</b> hold the key to enhancing this relationship. These Web interfaces can be dynamically manipulated to enhance user friendliness and satisfaction. From the e-business viewpoint this requires supply chain integration, knowledge management, intelligent agent software, the measurement of Web interface effectiveness and the ability to upgrade the Web site dynamically. The <b>e-customer</b> provides another dimension to this equation. Customer demographics must be captured and linked into the knowledge management, business intelligence systems and the supply chain. These equations then respond to the <b>e-customer</b> in a dynamic manner, providing an enhanced 'one-on-one' relationship between the <b>e-customer</b> and the e-business...|$|E

The research reported in this paper explored the perceptions of a group of New Zealand e-customers and e-users about <b>e-customer</b> service and the influence of their perceptions on their attitudes towards Internet shopping. The study findings strongly indicate e-customers are only moderately satisfied with current <b>e-customer</b> service. Conversely, New Zealand e-users (i. e. : not yet “customers”) are discouraged from using the Internet for shopping due to issues such as credit card security, resistance to change, lack of physicality, hard-totrust online vendors, and the perceived insecurity of payment systems. The study found that the motivators to Internet shopping are: goods returns and refunds policy, privacy protection, timely online service, ease of use, help and support facilities. Based on these findings, some recommendations on <b>e-customer</b> service for Internet shopping are presented...|$|E

The aim was to investigate how gender moderates the impact of delivery and return policies on purchase and return behavior in e-commerce. We ran the experiment in cooperation with nelly. com, a Nordic e-commerce site that specializes in fashion and beauty. The main conclusion is that gender to some extent moderates purchase and return behavior among <b>e-customers.</b> However, these effects seem too small and sometimes too complex {{in terms of their}} interaction with delivery and return conditions to be exploitable by e-tailers from a practical perspective. In other words, the statistically significant gender effects observed here are insignificant in practice.

40|$|As the Internet is posing revolutionary {{changes to}} {{customer}} service and the way customers interact and purchase from businesses, loyal e-customers are crucial for the long-term survival and profitability of a business. Driven by high connectivity, reach and richness of information in today's global business environment, the task of retaining and creating loyal e-customers calls for an appreciation of cultural factors {{and their impact on}} <b>e-customer</b> service and loyalty. Specifically, this study examines the impact of Confucian culture on <b>e-customer</b> loyalty in South Korea. Since no research has yet examined the link between Confucian values and <b>e-customer</b> loyalty, the study proposes a conceptual model for empirical analysis by drawing on insights from Hofstede's cultural dimensions and previous studies on <b>e-customer</b> loyalty in European contexts. The main results show that high power distance in Confucian culture is positively associated with affiliation. But this high power distance in Confucian culture is moderated by marketing activities that lead to lock-in. This indicates the profound influence of collectivism in Confucian culture and emphasises the importance of referral and community participation in increasing stickiness and hence loyal e-customers...|$|E

40|$|Advances in web-based {{oriented}} {{technologies and}} services are taking place with a considerable speed around the world. New technologies have significantly influenced trade, and converted traditional commerce to e-Commerce. Modern commerce enables people to conduct business in their offices or at homes, with minimal time, cost, error, and maximum efficiency. Customer trust, satisfaction and loyalty play vital roles in {{the success or failure}} of e-Commerce. It is also clear that loyal customers are one of the most important assets of firms, which results in long-term benefits. In this research, three problems were addressed. Firstly, companies easily lose their <b>e-Customers</b> in the competitive environment of today‘s business (Internet). Secondly, gaining loyal customers takes a long time, and is high in cost. Thirdly, there are inactive and nonprofitable customers in the database of online companies; converting inactive and nonprofitable customers to active and profitable customers by increasing their trust, satisfaction and loyalty. These three basic problems encourage us to study the nature of e-Loyalty formation in e-Commerce. The main aim of this study is to answer the question of how firms can increase Electronic Trust (e-Trust), Electronic Satisfaction (e-Satisfaction) and Electronic Loyalty (e-Loyalty) among their <b>e-Customers.</b> A review of literature and interviews with experts in this domain revealed that e-Satisfaction and e-Trust are two important factors that influence e-Loyalty. The significant aspect of this research is derived from the inclusion of a comprehensive conceptual framework with different aspects of technology, organization, and customers (three main entities in e-Commerce). Nine hypotheses display the relationships between technological, organizational, and customer factors with e-Satisfaction and e-Trust, which is significantly influence e- Loyalty. The data for this study were collected from <b>e-Customers</b> of the largest retail company in Iran in 2011, and statistical analyses were used to validate and ensure the reliability of the proposed model. The results showed the relationship between technological, organizational and customer factors with e-Satisfaction, e-Trust, and finally, e-Loyalty. The findings also revealed the fact that technological factor has the most effect on e-Satisfaction, e-Trust and e-Loyalty. Furthermore, Artificial Neural Fuzzy Interface System (ANFIS) was utilized to estimate e-Loyalty based on e- Satisfaction and e-Trust as assessment of the results. The outcomes showed a slight iii difference between the prediction of ANFIS and e-Loyalty data. The results of both methods (statistical analysis and ANFIS) confirm the reliability of the model.

In this paper we describe <b>e-customer</b> behavior in B 2 C relationships and then according to this behavior a new model for evaluating <b>e-customer</b> in B 2 C e-commerce relationships will be described. The most important thing in our e-CLV (Electronic Customer Lifetime Value) model is considering market's risks that are affecting customer cash flow in future. A lot of CLV models are based on simple NPV (simple net present value). However simple NPV can assess a good value for CLV, but simple NPV ignores two important aspects of B 2 C e-relationship which are market risks and big amount of customer data in e-commerce context. Therefore, simple NPV isn't enough for assessing e-CLV in high risk B 2 C markets. Instead of NPV, real option analyses could lead us to a better estimation for future cash flow of customers. With real option analyses, we predict all the future states with probability of each of them. And then calculate the more accurate of future customer cash flow. In this paper after a brief history of CLV, we explain customer behavior in B 2 C markets especially for e-retailers. Then with using real option analyses, we introduce our CLV model.

40|$|The {{development}} of e-commerce has caused an important {{change in the}} flows of goods. A lot of products are bought by means of electronic Business-to-Customer (B 2 C) transactions, nowadays. To and fro driving vans, delivering products to the end consumer or transporting returns are conquering the city; the consequences are an increased burdening of the logistic web and the environment. The control of the enormous amount of traffic in the cities is really becoming a serious problem. Besides, the costs of dealing with returns are disproportionate compared to forward logistics. An {{important part of the}} transport movements is caused by apparel returns and the amount of returns is still increasing. To deploy appropriate avoidance techniques, which can be utilized to decrease the amount of apparel returns, {{it is important to understand}} e-customers’ behavior. The main purpose of this investigation is to clarify if and how perceived return policy and perceived quality of information and customer support on websites in apparel e-commerce affect customers’ purchase and return behavior. E-retailers should know on which aspects of return policy <b>e-customers</b> set great store and which aspects of provided information and support on websites <b>e-customers</b> value most. This knowledge can help managers to develop and manage the most effective apparel return policy and website quality, in order to stimulate consumer demand, to increase sales and to reduce returns. The most feasible method of investigation here is doing a survey on consumers. A convenient sample of college students is requested to complete a questionnaire that contained measures of e-customers’ awareness of return policy, customers’ valuation of quality of information on websites, customers’ satisfaction, customers’ willingness to buy online and product return frequency. The students are an appropriate sample because they are likely to have had experiences with the Internet and are likely to vary widely in their e-purchase and e-return experiences. The most important empirical findings are that return policy has no influence on return behavior and return policy only affects purchase behavior of men. Purchase behavior of men and woman both predict their return behavior. Increased satisfaction and website quality don’t reduce, but increase apparel returns. Thus, purchase behavior, website quality and customers’ satisfaction all seem to have impact on apparel return behavior. The practical implication for managers of online shops therefore is the necessity of keeping focusing on and investing in the leniency and clarity of pursued return policy. And the necessity of keeping focusing on and investing in professional, optimal supporting website quality, to increase sales. To reduce returns, managers should focus on influencing purchase behavior by offering more guidance, by providing more caring and individualized information and attention on websites, leading customers to make purchase decisions more thoughtfully...|$|R
