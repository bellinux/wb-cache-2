5|$|Ganguli {{was born}} in a Bengali Hindu Brahmin family in Kolkata, West Bengal, India, {{reportedly}} the son of an art historian. Some sources state that one of his great-grandfathers was the private secretary to Rabindranath Tagore, the Bengali poet who was Asia's first Nobel laureate. As an infant, Ganguli was brought up by his grandmother. He claimed <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> his mother, and throughout his childhood was only visited by his art-historian father once a month. He grew up in Kolkata in a creative environment pursuing artistic interests.|$|E
5|$|Throughout all this, Lody's {{demeanour}} {{was relatively}} calm {{after the initial}} shock. Cheeseman observed that Lody only appeared uneasy when his notebook was being examined; the inspector later commented that Lody was not the usual class of man he was accustomed to dealing with, but admitted that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> a man under precisely similar circumstances. Cheeseman had been educated in Germany, knew the language and felt able to recognise a German accent; he noticed that Lody's American accent slipped from time to time, presumably due to stress, and became convinced {{that the man was}} German.|$|E
5|$|As the war progressed, Hitler's {{attention}} became {{focused on}} foreign affairs and {{the conduct of the}} war, to the exclusion of all else. Hess, not directly engaged in either of these endeavours, became increasingly sidelined from the affairs of the nation and from Hitler's attention; Bormann had successfully supplanted Hess in many of his duties and usurped his position at Hitler's side. Also concerned that Germany would face a war on two fronts as plans progressed for Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union scheduled to take place in 1941, Hess boldly decided to attempt to bring Britain to the negotiating table by travelling there himself to seek meetings with the British government. He asked the advice of Albrecht Haushofer, who suggested several potential contacts in Britain. Hess settled on fellow aviator Douglas Douglas-Hamilton, the Duke of Hamilton, whom <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>met.</b> On Hess's instructions, Haushofer wrote to Hamilton in September 1940, but the letter was intercepted by MI5 and Hamilton did not see it until March 1941. Hamilton was chosen in the mistaken belief {{that he was one of}} the leaders of an opposition party opposed to war with Germany, and because he was a friend of Haushofer.|$|E

5|$|In June 1976, Gravel was {{the focus}} of a federal {{investigation}} into allegations that he was involved in a sex-for-vote arrangement. Congressional staff clerk Elizabeth Ray (who was already the subject of a sex scandal that led to the downfall of Representative Wayne Hays) stated that in August 1972, she had sex with Gravel aboard a houseboat on the Potomac River, under the instruction of Representative Kenneth J. Gray, her boss at the time. Gray allegedly wanted to secure Gravel's support for further funding for construction of the National Visitor Center in Washington, a troubled project that was under the jurisdiction of subcommittees that both members chaired. Another Congressional staffer said she witnessed the boat encounter, but Gravel said at the time that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> either of the women. Both Gravel and Gray strongly denied that they had made any arrangement regarding legislation, and neither was ever charged with any wrongdoing. Decades later, Gravel wrote that he had indeed had sex with Ray, but had not changed any votes because of it.|$|E

An American counterterrorism {{official}} claimed that the CIA and MI5 suspected Begg had worked with Khalil Deek, who also lived in Peshawar at that time, to create a CD-ROM terrorist manual. Begg said in interviews that he had met Deek in Bosnia and later collaborated {{with him on a}} business enterprise to sell traditional Pakistani clothing, but said <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> Zubaydah. Pentagon officials said this conflicts with what he told interrogators.|$|E

25|$|Throughout {{his life}} as a scholar, Li Zhuan wrote commentaries, guides, annotations, etc., to a number of ancient texts, {{including}} the Yijing, Book of Documents, Mao Commentary, Etiquette and Ceremonial, Book of Rites, Rites of Zhou, Zuo Zhuan, and Taixuan Zhigui (太玄指歸). His writings followed the styles of Jia Kui and Ma Rong rather than that of Zheng Xuan. Although <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> his contemporary Wang Su before, his works and interpretations of Confucianism turned out to be similar to Wang Su's. He died {{in the middle of the}} Jingyao era (258–263) of Liu Shan's reign.|$|E
25|$|Thomas {{was a man}} of many contradictions. His {{good looks}} and noble comportment greatly {{impressed}} his contemporaries. The Italian condottiero Gaspare Broglio da Lavello (son of Angelo Tartaglia), whom he met in 1452, wrote that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> a prince more refined and dignified, surpassing even the intellectual humanist Federico da Montefeltro, Broglio's idol. At the same time, however, Thomas' inconstancy and lack of courage inspired disdain. He was capable of both great generosity and pettiness. His reputation abroad was damaged by his fickleness, while religious persecution and forced conversions caused disapproval at home; he was cursed {{in the early years of}} the Ottoman rule for robbing the indigenous Bosnian Church of its property.|$|E
25|$|In 1955, de Hory sold several forgeries to Chicago art dealer, Joseph W. Faulkner, {{who later}} {{discovered}} they were fakes.

He continued to work on a travel book about his Nyasaland adventures called Venture to the Interior, which became an immediate best-seller in the US and Europe on its publication in 1952.|$|E

Húrin's son, Túrin Turambar, was sent to Doriath, leaving his mother and unborn sister behind in his father's kingdom (which had been overrun by the enemy). Túrin achieved many great deeds of valour, the greatest being {{the defeat of the}} dragon Glaurung. Despite his heroism, however, Túrin was plagued by the curse of Melkor, which led him unwittingly to murder his friend Beleg and to marry and impregnate his sister Nienor, whom <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> before, and who had lost her memory through Glaurung's enchantment. Before their child was born, the bewitchment was lifted as the dragon lay dying. Nienor, realizing what grew within her, took her own life. Upon learning the truth, Túrin threw himself on his sword.|$|E

Lu Mao, who was from a more affluent family, often shared his wealth with them. Xu Yuan (徐原), who was also from Wu Commandery, moved to Kuaiji Commandery. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> Lu Mao before, but before his death, he wrote to Lu Mao and requested Lu to help him {{take care of his}} young son.

Serafín stated that the Federal Judicial Police commander Juan Benítez Ayala found Serafín guilty because he was related to Elio and Ovidio. He said he was not arrested at the ranch, but rather at Elio's in-law's house in Matamoros. He said he grew up in Houston and moved to Brownsville for college, and that he was in Matamoros visiting his family when he was taken by the police. Serafín said he had been tortured by the Mexican and U.S. police in Matamoros to confess his participation in Kilroy's murder and in the killings at Santa Elena. He said he was allegedly beaten and told that he and his family would be killed if he spoke English during his declaration. He said he was a student of Texas Southmost College and knew who Aldrete was, but had not a relationship with her. Serafín also stated that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> Constanzo and had no idea his family ranch was a gathering place for his cult. He said that he had never dug up the bodies and had been taken to the ranch after the bodies were already exhumed.|$|E

However, McWilliam cites the monumental study by Douglas Woodruff (1957), {{in which the}} author posits that the Claimant could just possibly have been Roger Tichborne. Woodruff's principal argument is the sheer improbability that anyone could conceive such an imposture from scratch, at such a distance, and then implement it: [...] "t was carrying effrontery {{beyond the bounds of}} sanity if Arthur Orton embarked with a wife and retinue and crossed the world, knowing that they would all be destitute if he did not succeed in convincing a woman <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>met</b> and knew nothing about first-hand, that he was her son".|$|E
