40|$|Abstract: Lettuce mosaic {{has been}} a {{long-term}} world wide problem. Resistance is available at a single locus. A single gene, partially dominant, for mild reaction, can be combined with an allele for resistance to produce {{a higher level of}} resistance. Breeding work is under way. An additional source of high level resistance has been tentatively identified. A new seed borne strain of LMV that overcomes resistance may become a problem. Big vein has also been a long-term problem. Moderate sources of resistance have been identified, based upon proportion of plants showing symptoms at harvest time. Pavane appears to have the highest level of the identified sources. The species Lactuca virosa appears to have complete resistance and is being used in a breeding program. Verticillium is a new disease in lettuce. No <b>iceberg</b> <b>type</b> <b>lettuce</b> cultivars tested are resistant.

40|$|When {{trade costs}} {{are of the}} <b>iceberg</b> <b>type</b> (Samuelson 1952) and markups are {{independent}} of trade costs, relative prices across markets are distorted, but relative prices within markets are not. When trade costs depart from the analytically convenient <b>iceberg</b> <b>type,</b> distortion will also occur within markets. In this paper we build a heterogeneous firm model of trade that allows for both iceberg and per-unit costs. An important theoretical finding is that these within-market distortions create an additional channel of gains from trade through within-industry reallocation. We fit the model to firm-level export data, by product and destination, using a novel minimum distance estimator and find that average per-unit costs, expressed relative to the consumer price, are 35 - 45 %, depending on the elasticity of substitution. The pure iceberg model is therefore rejected. Finally, we calibrate the model and quantify the costs of protectionism. Simulations indicate that the welfare costs are roughly 50 % higher when tariffs are per-unit compared to when they are iceberg. exports; intra-industry reallocation; trade costs; trade liberalization...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to evaluate the competitive ability of summer crisp and butterhead <b>lettuce</b> <b>types</b> in coexistence with populations of ryegrass. The experimental design was completely randomized in a factorial 2 x 7 scheme, with four replications. On the A factor the <b>lettuce</b> <b>types</b> (summer crisp and butterhead) were allocated and, on B, the densities of ryegrass (0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 plants per pot). The number of leaves, chlorophyll content, leaf area, green mass and dry mass of the <b>lettuce</b> <b>types</b> and ryegrass were evaluated, and the diameter of the culture stem and the tiller number of the weed were determined. Differences in competitive ability between the <b>lettuce</b> <b>types</b> in competition with ryegrass were found, and butterhead was the most competitive when compared with summer crisp for all variables studied. There was an average loss of leaf area in <b>lettuce</b> <b>types</b> of up to 80 % when it competed with ryegrass in the populations involved. Ryegrass is a very competitive weed to infect lettuce, and its handling is necessary, even at low densities to avoid productivity losses.

40|$|Many {{empirical}} {{studies have found}} both inter-industry and intra-industry externalities {{in the form of}} local knowledge spillovers in research. This paper makes some assumptions reflecting these empirical regularities in order to analyse their implications for the allocation of economic activities between two regions. The two main assumptions are that R&D guarantees a positive equilibrium rate of growth in the volume of output by increasing the marginal productivity of labour, and that it is characterised by geographically bounded intra-industry as well as inter-industry knowledge spillovers. The existence of an <b>iceberg</b> <b>type</b> cost in transporting consumption goods from one region to the other, together with increasing returns to scale in production, introduces a centripetal force; this is opposed by a centrifugal force associated with congestion costs: agents living in crowded areas suffer a reduction in their level of utility. In equilibrium, different locations of research and manufacturing firms can result. Where transport costs are higher (congestion costs lower), centripetal forces dominate and all economic activities end up concentrated in one region. As transport costs decrease (congestion costs increase), an equilibrium with activities in both regions becomes more likely. research and development, externalities, regional analysis...|$|R
40|$|Plant {{secondary}} metabolites {{are considered}} key bioactive compounds {{for a healthy}} diet. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) may interact with host plant metabolism, inducing the accumulation of health-promoting phytochemicals and antioxidant molecules. Lettuce is a largely consumed vegetable, which may interact with AMF to alter its content of secondary metabolites and natural antioxidants molecules, as previously shown in cultivars belonging to var. capitata or var. longifolia. In this study, the effects of red and green leaf Lactuca sativa var. crispa inoculation with different AMF species, Rhizoglomus irregulare and Funneliformis mosseae, were investigated, by assessing the total phenolics and anthocyanins content, and the antioxidant activity of leaf tissue. A significant increase of antioxidant activity and of phenolics were observed in plants of both cultivars inoculated with R. irregulare, compared to non inoculated plants. Likewise, anthocyanins (in red leaf lettuce) were more abundant in inoculated plants than in controls.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to formalize the notion of general trading costs in pure theory of {{international}} trade. We start from the basic Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson(HOS) model of trade and explicitly bring in a trading sector which processes trading or transaction in the economy. The trading cost is modeled as the typical <b>iceberg</b> <b>type</b> of cost whereby a fraction of the value of output to be transacted is lost in the process if there are no traders in the system. We highlight the total value of trade that is transacted in an economy which, by definition, must include total value of production in exportables and demand for the import competing good. Resources are needed to carry out trading and the lost value of trade goes towards compensating the traders. The general equilibrium approach we adopt identifies traders with potential workers and therefore in equilibrium with perfect intersectoral labor mobility, trading remuneration must coincide with the wage. The economy then divided into two segments, one where production takes place by using capital and labor a la the standard 2 x 2 model and the other where trading takes place by using labor alone. Such a system is related to the hybrid structure accommodating the HOS and the specific-factor model as analyzed in earlier works b...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that natural {{ultraviolet}} (UV) radiation increases secondary products such as phenolics but can significantly inhibit biomass accumulation in lettuce plants. In the work presented here, the effect of UV radiation on phenolic concentration and biomass accumulation was assessed in relation to photosynthetic performance in red and green <b>lettuce</b> <b>types.</b> <b>Lettuce</b> plants in polythene clad tunnels were exposed to either ambient (UV transparent film) or UV-free conditions (UV blocking film). The study tested whether growth reduction in lettuce plants exposed to natural UV radiation is because of inhibition of photosynthesis by direct damage to the photosynthetic apparatus or by internal shading by anthocyanins. Ambient levels of UV radiation did not limit the efficiency of photosynthesis suggesting that phenolic compounds may effectively protect the photosynthetic apparatus. Growth inhibition does, however, occur in red lettuce and {{could be explained by}} the high metabolic cost of phenolic compounds for UV protection. From a commercial perspective, UV transparent and UV blocking films offer opportunities because, in combination, they could increase plant quality as well as productivity. Growing plants continuously under a UV blocking film, and then 6 days before the final harvest transferring them to a UV transparent film, showed that high yields and high phytochemical content can be achieved complementarily...|$|R

In both models, my analysis suggests that firms are willing to invest in transport and communication technology when such a strategy turns out to be efficient, i. e. when it does not imply an excessive cost. More precisely, a variety of equilibria will arise as a result of different levels of TC r&D efficiency. If the cost is low the game has an equilibrium in dominant strategies where both firms invest in TC and maximize the aggregate profit. As the cost increases, the game becomes a prisoner`s dilemma; both firms still invest in Tc but they do not reach the Pareto-efficient solution. For even higher levels of the cost required, the game shows an equilibrium in dominant strategies where no firms finances TC R&D and the aggregate profit is maximized...|$|R

Our objectives were (1) to assess to what extent growing season influence growth and nutritional quality of the green-leaf Batavia Rubia Munguía (BRM) and the red-leaf Maravilla de Verano (MV) lettuce cultivars; (2) to test if the growing season affected the effectiveness of AMF as enhancers of the nutritional quality of the aforementioned cultivars; and (3) to check if inoculation with AMF allows extending the season to cultivate these two lettuce cultivars, without a loss of plant growth or nutritional quality. Results showed that winter was the most favourable growing season for both <b>types</b> of <b>lettuce</b> but mycorrhizal plants cultivated in other seasons different from winter achieved higher or similar shoot biomass than their respective non-inoculated controls in winter. AMF induced the accumulation of Fe, proteins, carotenoids and anthocyanins in both cultivars of lettuce in winter and spring.
