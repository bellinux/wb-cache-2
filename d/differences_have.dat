5|$|There are {{physical}} {{differences between}} the show strains and working strains in the UK. While the show strain is bred to the conformation standard, the working strain is bred for working ability and as such several physical <b>differences</b> <b>have</b> appeared. Working type dogs tend to be larger with flatter heads and shorter ears. The coat also tends to be shorter and finer than the show variety and have less feathering. The working strain {{seems to be more}} energetic than the show strain.|$|E
5|$|The common {{phenomenon}} amongst {{birds in}} which {{males and females}} {{of the same species}} exhibit different characteristics beyond the differences in their sexual organs. It can manifest in size or plumage differences. Sexual size dimorphism varies among taxa with males typically being larger, though this is not always the case i.e. in birds of prey, hummingbirds, and some species of flightless birds. Plumage dimorphism, in the form of ornamentation or colouration, also varies, though males are typically the more ornamented or brightly coloured sex. Such <b>differences</b> <b>have</b> been attributed to the unequal reproductive contributions of the sexes.|$|E

50|$|Deleuze {{paints a}} picture of {{philosophical}} history in which <b>difference</b> <b>has</b> long been subordinated to four pillars of reason: identity, opposition, analogy, and resemblance. He argues that <b>difference</b> <b>has</b> been treated as a secondary characteristic which emerges when one compares pre-existing things; these things can then be said to <b>have</b> <b>differences.</b> This network of direct relations between identities roughly overlays a much more subtle and involuted network of real differences: gradients, intensities, overlaps, and so forth (50).|$|R

5|$|The species breeds in North America and {{winters in}} the Caribbean. Some studies have {{observed}} {{significant differences in}} terms of migratory behavior and plumage color between northern and southern populations within the breeding range. The northern population mainly winters in the western Caribbean (Cuba and Jamaica) while the southern population usually spends the winter on eastern islands (Hispaniola and Puerto Rico). Moreover, males in the southern population have darker plumage {{than those in the}} northern population. These <b>differences</b> <b>have</b> led biologists to consider them as separate subspecies. However, a recent study in the United States reveals no significant genetic differentiation between northern (samples from Michigan, New Hampshire and New York states) and southern populations (sample from North Carolina). The study results actually show a recent population expansion from a single glacial refugium, therefore the current populations are homogeneous in terms of genetics. The differentiation that is observed between the northern and southern populations should have occurred quite recently.|$|E

40|$|The {{amino acid}} {{composition}} of the following variants of β-lactoglobulin has been determined: bovine A, B and C; ovine A and B; and caprid. Some of the amino acid <b>differences</b> within species <b>have</b> been characterized at the peptide level. The bovine A:Asp/B:Gly <b>difference</b> peptides <b>have</b> been located and studied. The peptides involving the assumed A:Val/B:Ala <b>difference</b> <b>have</b> not been detected. These observations are in essential agreement with those of Townend. Bovine B:Gln/C:His <b>difference</b> peptides <b>have</b> been isolated from the 2 ̆ 7 tryptic core 2 ̆ 7. The extra glutamic acid residue of B compared with C, occurs in the amide form, glutamine, in the protein. The ovine B:His <b>difference</b> <b>has</b> been related to Gln in ovine A.

25|$|The long {{trend of}} growth in living {{standards}} paired with diminishing differences between social classes was dramatically reversed during the 1990s. For {{the first time in}} the history of Finland income <b>differences</b> <b>have</b> sharply grown.

25|$|<b>Differences</b> <b>have</b> {{been found}} between the proteines {{expressed}} by patients and healthy subjects, and between attacks and remissions.

Under these classifications, two-rowed barley with shattering spikes (wild barley) is classified as Hordeum spontaneum K. Koch. Two-rowed barley with nonshattering spikes is classified as H. distichum L., six-row barley with nonshattering spikes as H. vulgare L. (or H. hexastichum L.), and six-row with shattering spikes as H. agriocrithon Åberg.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{cities are}} known for {{creating}} their own microclimates, due to concrete, asphalt, and other artificial surfaces, which heat up in sunlight and channel rainwater into underground ducts. The temperature in New York City exceeds nearby rural temperatures {{by an average of}} 2–3°C and at times 5–10°C <b>differences</b> <b>have</b> been recorded. This effect varies nonlinearly with population changes (independently of the city's physical size). Aerial particulates increase rainfall by 5–10%. Thus, urban areas experience unique climates, with earlier flowering and later leaf dropping than in nearby country.|$|E
25|$|Molecular genetic {{studies have}} defined {{at least two}} loci for TSC. In TSC1, the {{abnormality}} is localized on chromosome 9q34, but {{the nature of the}} gene protein, called hamartin, remains unclear. No missense mutations occur in TSC1. In TSC2, the gene abnormalities are on chromosome 16p13. This gene encodes tuberin, a guanosine triphosphatase–activating protein. The specific function of this protein is unknown. In TSC2, all types of mutations have been reported; new mutations occur frequently. Few <b>differences</b> <b>have</b> yet been observed in the clinical phenotypes of patients with mutation of one gene or the other.|$|E

Not only social, but also economic tensions between the Northern and Southern states were so severe that they eventually caused the South to declare itself an independent nation, the Confederate States of America; thus provoking the American Civil War. One example of regional variations is the attitude towards the discussion of sex, often sexual discussions would have less restrictions in the Northeastern United States, but yet is seen as taboo in the Southern United States.|$|E
