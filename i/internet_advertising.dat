The most common transplants are to close relatives, but people have given kidneys to other friends. The rarest type of donation is the undirected donation whereby a donor gives a kidney to a stranger. Less than a few hundred of such kidney donations have been performed. In recent years, searching for altruistic donors via the internet has also become a way to find life saving organs. However, <b>internet</b> <b>advertising</b> for organs is a highly controversial practice, as some scholars believe it undermines the traditional list-based allocation system.|$|E

2500|$|Many brands are now heavily {{using this}} mobile app {{to boost their}} {{marketing}} strategy. Instagram {{can be used to}} gain the necessary momentum needed to capture the attention of the market segment that has an interest in the product offering or services. As Instagram is supported by Apple and android system, it can be easily accessed by smartphone users. Moreover, it can be accessed by the Internet as well. Thus, the marketers see it as a potential platform to expand their brands exposure to the public, especially the younger target group. On top of this, marketers do not only use social media for traditional <b>Internet</b> <b>advertising,</b> but they also encourage users to create attention for a certain brand. This generally creates an opportunity for greater brand exposure. Furthermore, marketers are also using the platform to drive social shopping and inspire people to collect and share pictures of their favorite products. Many big names have already jumped on board: Starbucks, MTV, Nike, Marc Jacobs, and Red Bull are a few examples of multinationals that adopted the mobile photo app early. Fashion blogger Danielle Bernstein, who goes by @weworewhat on Instagram, collaborated with Harper's Bazaar to do a piece on how brands are using Instagram to market their products, and how bloggers make money from it. Bernstein, who currently has one and a half million followers on Instagram, and whose [...] "outfit of the day" [...] photos on Snapchat get tens of thousands of screenshots, explained that for a lot of her sponsored posts, she must feature the brand in a certain number of posts, and often cannot wear a competitor's product in the same picture. According to Harper's Bazaar, industry estimates say that brands are spending more than $1 billion per year on consumer-generated advertising. Founder of Instagram Kevin Systrom even went to Paris Fashion week, going to couture shows and meeting with designers to learn more about how style bloggers, editors, and designers are currently dominating much of the content on his application.|$|E

In an earlier paper, Lindst 4 dt & Budzinski (2011) argued from a theoretical viewpoint that industryspecific patterns exist that determine substitution or complementation effects between <b>internet</b> and newspaper <b>advertising.</b> It was argued that retail advertising, in particular, may offer a niche for regional/local newspapers that can be expected to present a sustainable segment of complementarity along with the otherwise mostly substitutional advertising markets. This paper empirically tests these hypotheses by analyzing advertising spending data for newspaper and <b>internet</b> display <b>advertising</b> of 13 different industries in the U.

Whereas some industries showed clear substitution effects between internet display and newspaper advertising, the majority of our hypotheses could be only partly rejected: newspaper substitution effects could be observed, however, in the direction to traditional media platforms instead of <b>internet</b> display <b>advertising.</b> For two retail-sub-industries, the hypotheses could not be rejected for the analyzed period...|$|R

40|$|<b>Internet</b> display <b>advertising</b> {{has grown}} into a multi-billion dollar a year global {{industry}} and direct response campaigns account for about three-quarters of all <b>Internet</b> display <b>advertising.</b> In such campaigns, advertisers reach out to a target audience via some form of a visual advertisement (hereinafter also called “ad”) to maximize short-term sales revenue. In this study, we formulate an advertiser’s revenue maximization problem in direct response Internet display advertisement campaigns as a mixed integer program via piecewise linear approximation of the revenue function. A novelty of our approach is that ad location and content issues are explicitly incorporated in the optimization model. Computational experiments on a large-scale actual campaign indicate that adopting the optimal media schedule can significantly increase advertising revenues without any budget changes, and reasonably sized instances of the problem can be solved within short execution times...|$|R
