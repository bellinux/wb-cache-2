50|$|Palpita vitrealis, the <b>jasmine</b> <b>moth,</b> is {{a species}} of moth of the family Crambidae. It occurs worldwide, {{including}} Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe and America. In Europe, it is found in southern Europe, but may be found further north due to its migratory nature.|$|E
40|$|<b>Jasmine</b> <b>moth</b> {{population}} was monitored in olive groves in Cova da Beira, using traps baited with three commercial formulations of pheromone: Russell (in tricoloured funnel traps), SEDQ and Suterra (both in delta traps). Counts {{were carried out}} weekly from March to November 2010 for SEDQ’s pheromone and from September to November for Russell’s and Suterra´s pheromones. The scouts ranged among 0 and 4 insects/trap/ week. A contaminant Lepidoptera species, not yet identified, was captured in the SEDQ traps. They were smaller, brownish and they were captured largely than the <b>jasmine</b> <b>moth.</b> Comparing these flight curves to the ones obtained from Castelo Branco, Ribatejo and Alentejo Stations (official Advisory Services), regions where this pest was monitored using the same methodology, a great disparity {{in the number of}} individuals captured was observed, which raises the possibility of the contamination found here may also occur in some of these region...|$|E

The observations were carried out in 2000, from April 5 to November 7 and the first symptoms were observed on July 7. ‘Cobrançosa’ was significantly less attacked throughout the observation period and {{no significant differences were}} detected between the remaining. In order to explain these differences, leaf thickness of the different cultivars were compared by histological cuts but no differences were detected. No other differences regarding the presence and abundance of trichomes were found...|$|E
40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Agronómica - Hortofruticultura e Viticultura - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaIn {{order to}} control the <b>Jasmine</b> <b>Moth,</b> Palpita vitrealis (Rossi), the {{population}} evolution was studied in several olive cultivars (‘Arbequina’, ‘Cobrançosa’, and ‘Galega Vulgar’) located in an olive grove in Quinta do Galvão in Cova da Beira. The young larvae feed on the leaf underside and as they grow consume whole leaves and shoots. The second generation feed on fruit and seeds if high levels of population are achieved (Grossley, 2000). The larvae development is not well synchronised and is temperature-dependent, resulting in the simultaneous presence of eggs, different larval stages, pupae, and adults throughout the season (López-Villalta, 1999). This grove was monitored from March to November 2010, registering catches by traps baited with sex pheromone and observing shoots attacked using the risk assessment {{according to the national}} standards of integrated pest management. These data were compared with catches in various regions in the country collected through similar methodology. It was requested data of catches of P. vitrealis in these three warning stations (Baixo Alentejo, Ribatejo, and Beira Interior-Sul), due to low catches recorded in the olive grove of Cova da Beira, in order to compare the pest flight curves from various regions of the country. In the olive grove of Cova da Beira {{it was found that the}} cultivar 'Cobrançosa' was the least attacked (90. 9 shoots attacked on average). Apparently, this value was not due, to differences in the cultivar leaf thickness. It was also observed low catches of <b>Jasmine</b> <b>Moth</b> (0 - 8 catches per week) in Cova da Beira, Beira Interior Sul, and Ribatejo, although in Baixo Alentejo it was referred high flight peaks (about 50 catches in some weeks) by the official agricultural advisory services. A contaminant morphotype was caught in the pheromone traps at Cova da Beira but a specific identification was not achieved yet. Three different brands of sex pheromones (Biosani, AT&F, and Russell) were used to test their efficacy and potential. It was concluded that the AT&F sex pheromone revealed some potential, since it was the only one that obtained pest catches at the beginning of autumn, with rather low temperatures...|$|E
30|$|Olive {{is one of}} the {{important}} economical crops in Egypt. Olive trees are attacked by insect pests that affect quality and quantity of the yield. On olive trees, populations of the fruit fly, Bacteracera (Dacus) oleae Gamel are suppressed by the braconid parasitoid, Opius concolor Szepl. (Ajjan 1962), and those of the olive scale insect Parasaissetia oleae by the pteromalid parasitoid Sautellistea cyanea Mols. (Hosny et al. 1966). The two stem borers, Phlocotribus scarabaeides Bern. and Zeuzera pyrina L. are parasitized by two pteromalids, Cheiropochus quadrum and Rhaphitelus maculatus, and two unidentified species belonging to the genera Euplemus and Eurytoma (Ismail et al. 1988). The shot-hole borer Scolytus amaygdali (Coleoptera: Scolytidae) of olive trees is parasitized during its larval stage by seven hymenopterous parasitoids, i.e., Cerocephala cornigera, Cheiropachus quadrum, Rhaphites maculatus (Pteromalidae), Cephalonoma sp. (Bethylidae), Eupelmus sp. (Eupelmidae), Eurytoma sp. (Eurytomidae), and Leptomastix trunctellus (Encyrtidae) (Ismail et al. 1988). In most recent studies, El-Khawas et al. (2000) presented a detail record concerning parasitoids on common olive pests in Egypt, in Alexandria, Fayoum, and North Sinai Governorates. Opius concolor Szeph. (Braconidae), Prigalio agraules Walker (Eulophidae), Eupelmus sp. and Macroneara sp. (Eurytomidae), Eurytoma martelli Masi and Eurytoma sp. (Eurytomidae), and Cryptoprymna latipes Ronaldi (Pteromalidae) were reported on larvae of Bacterocera (Dacus) oleae, and Prays oleae Bern that feed on leaves, flower buds, and fruits was subject to attack by Apanteles sp. and Bracon sp. (Braconidae), while the <b>Jasmine</b> <b>moth,</b> Palipta unionalis Hb., that feeds on buds was parasitized by Apanteles syleptae F. (Braconidae) and Brachymeria aegyptiaca Masi (Chalcididae). The armored scale insect Leucaspis riccae Targ was attacked by Aphytis sp., while the California red scale A. aurantii by Marietta sp. (Aphelinidae) and Habrolepis sp. (Encyrtidae). A recent survey on parasitoids of B. oleae carried out by El-Heneidy et al. (2001 b) in Alexandria and El-Fayoum Governorates included eight hymenopterous parasitoids namely Cyroptyx latipes R., Cyroptyx sp., Eupelmus sp., Eurytoma sp., Eurytoma martelli, Macroneura sp., Prigalio agraules W., and Opius concolor S. The first seven species were recorded {{for the first time in}} Egypt. The eighth parasitoid species was recorded in the fresh fruits, while only six were recorded from the fallen fruits. All species were recorded during the period from July to November. Mean percentages of parasitism reached 38.9 and 10.8 % by the two species; O. concolor and P. agraules, respectively.|$|E
