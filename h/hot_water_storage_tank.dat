25|$|In a solar {{water heating}} system, a solar <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> stores heat from solar thermal collectors. The tank has a {{built-in}} heat-exchanger to heat domestic cold water. In relatively mild climates, such as the Mediterranean, the (heavily insulated but metal-wrapped) storage tanks are often roof-mounted. All such tanks share the same problems as artificially-heated tanks including limestone deposit and corrosion, and suffer similar reductions in overall efficiency unless scrupulously maintained.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the problem of dynamic performance evaluation for sensible thermal energy storage (TES), with a specific focus on <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> <b>tanks.</b> Â We derive transient performance metrics from second law principles {{that can be used}} to guide real-time decision-making aimed toward improving demand response. Â We show how the transient nature of the metrics can be used not only to influence the values of control variables within the system, but also to mitigate adverse effects of disturbances during operation. Â To evaluate these metrics in the context of TES in <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> <b>tanks,</b> a thermal stratification model is needed. Â We derive a reduced order model which allows the simulation of tank thermal stratification during all modes of system operation. Â The proposed performance metrics are analyzed in simulation using the dynamic tank model. The results highlight key trade-offs captured by the metrics that can be incorporated into future optimal control design for sensible TES systems. Â...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method of}} characterising the performance of <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> {{in terms of their}} temperature distribution. The change in exergy from the stratified state to the delivery state depends on the stored energy and the stratification. lt can thus be used to define the storage efficiency for sensible heat storage devices. The effect of temperature distribution, delivery temperature and tank cross section on exergy is investigated. The advantage that stratification offers over a mixed tank is examined in terms of the storage efficiency and overall solar water heating system performance. Exergy is used to assess the operation of mantle heat exchangers in solar water heating systems and it is shown that an exergy, rather than energy, should be used to ascertain the performance of such heat exchangers. ...|$|R
