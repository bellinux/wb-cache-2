2500|$|In {{accordance}} with his reputation, Morgan held numerous prestigious positions in American science organizations. From 1927 to 1931 Morgan {{served as the}} President of the National Academy of Sciences; in 1930 he was the President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science; and in 1932 he chaired the Sixth International Congress of Genetics in Ithaca, New York. In 1933 Morgan was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine; he had been nominated in 1919 and 1930 for the same work. As an acknowledgement of the group nature of his discovery he gave his prize money to Bridges', Sturtevant's and his own children. Morgan declined to attend the awards ceremony in 1933, instead attending in 1934. The 1933 rediscovery of the giant polytene chromosomes in the salivary gland of Drosophila may have influenced his choice. Until that point, the lab's results had been inferred from phenotypic results, the visible polytene chromosome enabled them to confirm their results on a physical basis. Morgan's Nobel acceptance speech entitled [...] "The Contribution of Genetics to Physiology and Medicine" [...] downplayed the contribution genetics could make to medicine beyond <b>genetic</b> <b>counselling.</b> In 1939 {{he was awarded the}} Copley Medal by the Royal Society.|$|E

40|$|This article aims {{to examine}} whether there is {{continuity}} between eugenics as employed in Nazi Germany and modern-day medical genetics.

Finally, it addresses ethical issues that arise during <b>genetic</b> reproduction <b>counselling.</b> Namely, it reviews how genetic information during <b>genetic</b> reproduction <b>counselling</b> is presented to those being counselled and puts forward the idea on how to stay committed to the principle of non-directiveness...|$|R

40|$|Sjogren-Larsson {{syndrome}} (SLS) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal recessive}} disorder characterized by ichthyosis, spastic di- or tetraplegia and mental retardation due a defect of the fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH), related to mutations in the ALDH 3 A 2 gene. In this study, we screened a French cohort of patients with Sjogren-Larsson syndrome (SLS) for mutations in the ALDH 3 A 2 gene. The five unrelated patients with typical SLS all present mutations in this gene. Three novel mutations were identified whereas three other ones were previously described. We also realized functional analyses at the mRNA level for two splice site mutations to study their deleterious consequences. Two of the previously described mutations had already been identified in the same region of Europe, suggesting a putative founder effect. We suggest that, (1) when clinical and MR features are present, direct sequencing of the ALDH 3 A 2 gene in SLS {{is of particular interest}} without necessity of a skin biopsy for enzymatic assay in order to propose <b>genetic</b> <b>counsel</b> and (2) identification of mutations already described in the same population with putative founder effects may simplify genetic analysis in this context.

40|$|Research to {{date has}} mainly focused on the {{short-term}} psychological impact of <b>genetic</b> risk <b>counselling</b> for breast cancer. This study aimed to explore the long-term consequences for women of being informed about {{an increased risk of}} breast cancer in terms of: the effect on their everyday lives, their coping strategies and their unmet needs in terms of the current service. The participants were 25 women with a family history of breast cancer who had received <b>genetic</b> risk <b>counselling</b> and had consequently been receiving clinical surveillance for at least 2 years. They took part in one of seven telephone focus groups and subsequently completed a feedback questionnaire. Transcripts of the focus groups were qualitatively analysed by three independent researchers with inter-rater agreement between pairs of raters ranging from Kappa= 0. 61 - 0. 79. Six key issues emerged from the data, which provide an important insight into the long-term consequences of living with an increased risk of breast cancer concerning: (1) psychological adaptation, (2) behavioural adaptation, (3) family issues, (4) clinical surveillance, (5) provision of information, and (6) peer support. These findings, together with the quantitative results of the feedback questionnaire, have clinical implications that require further investigation in larger scale quantitative research.

40|$|Four {{principles}} are taken as {{basis for the}} ethical analysis: autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, and justice. Health is understood as a limited aspect of wellbeing. Food is understood as an aspect of wellbeing, not only an instrument for health. Modern society {{is characterized by a}} tendency to identify wellbeing with external rather than subjective circumstances, to identify wellbeing with health, and to create exaggerated health expectations. Based upon this understanding, aspects of personalized nutrition are discussed: <b>genetic</b> testing, <b>counselling,</b> and fabrication of special dietary products. Today the predictive value of genetic tests for personal nutrition is limited, and experimental at best. Recommendations for the future: Personalized nutrition must be based on solid knowledge. Phenotypic analyses should be used when adequate. When a genetic test can have a clear advantage, this should be preferred. Opportunistic screening should only be used when clearly beneficial. Information concerning <b>genetic</b> tests, and <b>counselling,</b> should be made on a personal basis by specially trained persons. Marketing of genetic tests directly sold to the public should be discouraged. Fabrication of special products for personalized nutrition may be necessary in some cases. However, this may also lead to a medicalization of diet...|$|R

40|$|Women’s {{perceptions}} {{of breast cancer}} risk are largely inaccurate and are often associated {{with high levels of}} anxiety about cancer.

Reasons for this are unclear, but may relate to personal beliefs about susceptibility and to problems or variations in risk communication. Research into the impact of demographic and psychological factors on risk perception has been inconclusive. An understanding of the process of developing a perception of risk would help to inform risk counselling strategies. This is important, because knowledge of risk is needed both for appropriate health care decision making and to reassure women who are not at increased risk...|$|R

50|$|In 1968, after {{experiencing}} Huntington's disease (HD) in his wife's family, Dr. Milton Wexler {{was inspired}} to start the Hereditary Disease Foundation, {{with the aim of}} curing genetic illnesses by co-ordinating and supporting research. At a workshop held by the HDF in 1979, participants proposed to map the human genome and find a marker for the gene which causes HD. The HDF, together with the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and Dr. Wexler's daughter, Nancy Wexler, organized the US-Venezuela Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research Project. This project studied a kindred with an unusually high prevalence of HD. In 1983, a marker for a gene was found, and in the next decade, with further HDF involvement, the exact gene (Huntingtin) was found. Many techniques developed in finding the Huntingtin gene were used to advance the Human Genome Project. The Huntingtin gene {{was also one of the}} first disease genes to be found. Its discovery and the debates raised have provided the framework for <b>genetic</b> testing, <b>counselling</b> and possible therapies for other genetic diseases that can be genetically tested.|$|R

30|$|The recent {{advances}} in genetics with regards to SDH mutations have implications for radiology. The radiological diagnosis of a paraganglioma or pheochromocytoma should result in a full genetic workup. Included in this is the imaging of susceptible family members for paragangliomas [7].

SDH mutation-positive patients need ongoing screening as they are at high risk for developing paragangliomas, pheochromocytomas and further multifocal extraganglial tumours.
