2500|$|A sliding knife is a knife {{that can}} be opened by sliding the knife blade out {{the front of the}} handle. One method of opening is where the blade exits out the front of the handle point-first and then is locked into place (an example of this is the <b>gravity</b> <b>knife).</b> Another form is an O-T-F (out-the-front) switchblade, which only {{requires}} the push of a button or spring to cause the blade to slide out of the handle and lock into place. To retract the blade back into the handle, a release lever or button, usually the same control as to open, is pressed. [...] A very common form of sliding knife is the sliding utility knife (commonly known as a stanley knife or boxcutter).|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, knives are {{regulated}} by federal, state, and municipal laws. Some jurisdictions prohibit the possession {{or use of}} pocket knives that feature locking blades. Others prohibit certain blade styles perceived by law enforcement and legal authorities as optimal for offensive fighting, transforming the pocket knife from a utility tool into a deadly weapon. These might include knives with dirk, dagger (double-edge), bowie, or stiletto blades. In some jurisdictions {{it is illegal to}} conceal knives larger than a certain size or with blades over a certain length, particularly when combined with locking blade mechanisms. The possession or carrying of a folding pocket knife with a quick-opening mechanism such as a <b>gravity</b> <b>knife,</b> butterfly knife/balisong, or switchblade may be prohibited. [...] Under U.S. federal law, switchblades and ballistic knives are banned from interstate shipment, sale, or importation, or possession on federal or Indian lands or U.S. possessions and may be prohibited entirely in some states. Knives of any size or configuration may be prohibited by federal or state laws in certain designated areas or places, such as schools, courthouses, jails, power plants, or airports.|$|E
50|$|Switchblades and <b>gravity</b> <b>knives</b> {{provide a}} great variety of {{different}} OTF mechanisms.|$|R
5000|$|In Poland, balisongs, switchblades and <b>gravity</b> <b>knives</b> {{are treated}} like normal knives. There are no {{restrictions}} on possession and carry.|$|R
50|$|OTF knives may {{be further}} {{subdivided}} into manual sliding knives, {{which are not}} restricted as inertia knives, and automatic OTF switchblade <b>knives</b> and <b>gravity</b> <b>knives,</b> which are restricted offensive weapons (white weapon).|$|R
50|$|A gravity OTF knife is {{also not}} {{considered}} a slider, because the blade extends outward by force of gravity or inertia, instead of finger pressure. The most famous <b>gravity</b> <b>knife</b> is the Fallschirmjaeger-Messer, or German paratrooper knife of World War II. The term <b>gravity</b> <b>knife</b> should primarily reference the Fallschirmjaeger-Messer as the archetypical example.|$|E
50|$|In a few jurisdictions, such as Colorado and New York City, {{courts have}} {{periodically}} attempted to classify ordinary lock-blade folding knives with a blade {{that may be}} opened by centrifugal force (normally, using a flicking motion of the wrist) as a <b>gravity</b> <b>knife,</b> thus making the knife's owner {{subject to the same}} criminal penalties imposed for illegal possession of a <b>gravity</b> <b>knife.</b>|$|E

50|$|German law {{prohibits the}} manufacture, importation, or sale of {{butterfly}} <b>knives,</b> <b>gravity</b> <b>knives,</b> and push daggers (palm knives), {{as well as}} knives designed to be disguised as another object, such as a sword cane or belt buckle knife.|$|R
50|$|Other knives {{commonly}} {{mistaken for}} <b>gravity</b> <b>knives</b> include the automatic OTF knife, the switchblade and the butterfly knife (or balisong), the sliding knife, penny knife, and occasionally even common folding hunting knives {{such as the}} Buck 110 Folding Hunter.|$|R
50|$|Luftwaffe Edged Weapons {{included}} 1st and 2nd Model daggers, Paratrooper <b>Gravity</b> <b>knives,</b> {{swords and}} bayonets. The Luftwaffe Officers’ 2nd Pattern dagger made by Eickhorn, Solingen. The second model of Luftwaffe dagger was adopted for wear by officers and certain high-ranking NCOs in 1937.|$|R
50|$|The {{so-called}} 'conversion' <b>gravity</b> <b>knife</b> {{consists of}} a standard folding knife fitted with after-market modifications. The knife at the right does not lock closed, and is thus classed as a 'false' <b>gravity</b> <b>knife.</b> It can still be opened manually without touching the toggle switch. The addition of the toggle, which is attached to an internal bellcrank-arm, will lift the lockback mechanism to allow the blade to swing more easily.|$|E
50|$|According to Cap 217 《Weapons Ordinance》, Laws of Hong Kong, {{any person}} who has {{possession}} of any prohibited items (including <b>Gravity</b> <b>Knife</b> and Flick Knife) commits an offence.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, {{attention}} was brought by many newspapers and media outlets to 1950s era legislation leading to many arrests and convictions {{for possession of}} the loosely defined <b>gravity</b> <b>knife.</b>|$|E
50|$|In Illinois: it {{is legal}} to own and carry a {{butterfly}} knife. In Chicago {{it is illegal to}} carry concealed a knife with a blade longer than 2.5 inches. Concealed carry of a double-edged knife is prohibited. Automatic (switchblade) and <b>gravity</b> <b>knives</b> are prohibited.|$|R
5000|$|As of 2011 in the Netherlands {{a new law}} prohibits {{ownership}} or {{possession of}} the following knives, whether kept at home or not: Stilettos, switchblades, folding knives {{with more than one}} cutting edge, throwing knives, folding knives with an overall length of more than 28 cm when open, butterfly (balisong) or <b>gravity</b> <b>knives,</b> disguised knives (belt knife, sword cane, etc.) and push daggers. [...] Also, it is illegal to carry a fixed-blade knife with more than one cutting edge, though such a knife may be kept at home for collector purposes.|$|R
5000|$|Illustrated {{above are}} four very small OTF knives. Figure A shows simple rocking jaw type button, and Figure B is a roll-lock design. Both figures depict <b>gravity</b> <b>knives</b> that fall open. The {{leading edge of}} the roll cap or jaw acts as a hole cover when closed, and rests in a groove milled across the open blade tang in order to lock open.|$|R
5000|$|In New York, the balisong {{has been}} {{determined}} {{not to be a}} <b>gravity</b> <b>knife,</b> and therefore not prohibited under the Penal Law People v. Zuniga, 303 A.D.2d 773 (2nd Dept. 2003) ...|$|E
50|$|This knife is {{also known}} as a paratrooper knife, {{although}} it was never issued as such. The mechanism includes a collar that travels up the blade. This looks similar to an OTF <b>gravity</b> <b>knife</b> used by German paratroopers.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>gravity</b> <b>knife</b> is a {{knife with}} a blade {{contained}} in its handle, and which opens its blade {{by the force}} of inertia or gravity. [...] As the <b>gravity</b> <b>knife</b> requires gravity or spinning motion to propel the blade out of the handle, it differs fundamentally from the switchblade, which opens its spring-propelled blade automatically upon the push of a button, switch, or fulcrum lever. The main purpose of this opening method is that it allows opening and closing to be done one handed, in situations where the other hand is occupied. A major historical use has been in issue to parachutists to cut off their parachutes when tangled in a tree or in similar situations.|$|E
50|$|Rathner gained {{additional}} notoriety {{following the}} April 12, 2015, death of Freddie Gray, an African American man {{who died in}} the custody of the Baltimore Police Department after being arrested for purportedly carrying an illegal knife. Rathner's efforts to overturn knife laws such as the one under which Gray was arrested quickly gained national attention. In June 2016 Rathner successfully lobbied the New York State Senate to pass S6483-A/A9042-A, revising the state's much-publicized and highly controversial law banning the possession of <b>gravity</b> <b>knives.</b>|$|R
50|$|In Australia, switchblades {{are banned}} by the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations as a Prohibited Import. Australian customs refer to the {{automatic}} knife or switchblade as a flick knife. Australian law defines a flick knife as a knife that has a blade which opens automatically by gravity or centripetal force or by any pressure applied to a button, spring or device in or attached to {{the handle of the}} knife, a definition that would cover not only switchblades and automatic-opening <b>knives</b> but also <b>gravity</b> <b>knives</b> and balisongs.|$|R
5000|$|... ===Fallschirmjäger-Messer=== One of {{the most}} {{recognizable}} <b>gravity</b> <b>knives</b> is the World War II Luftwaffe Fallschirmjäger-Messer or German air force paratrooper knife, which utilizes a four-inch (100 mm) telescoping (OTF), gravity-propelled locking blade. First produced in 1937, the FJM was issued to German flight crews and paratroops, primarily {{for the purpose of}} cutting a trapped parachutist from his rigging in case he landed with a tangled parachute, or became entangled in trees with the shroud lines. [...] Though not intended for use as a fighting knife, the FJM's blade could be and was used as a close combat weapon when necessary.|$|R
5000|$|In some countries, {{such as the}} United Kingdom, Canada, and {{in certain}} U.S. states, a <b>gravity</b> <b>knife</b> is defined under the law as a {{prohibited}} weapon, with attendant criminal penalties. Other laws may criminalize the ownership, sale, importation, or carrying of a <b>gravity</b> <b>knife</b> upon one's person, either concealed or unconcealed. In the United States, some state criminal codes prohibit either the ownership or the carrying of gravity knives, either by name or by including a functional description of their opening mechanisms. Other state criminal codes bar gravity knives by redefining them variously as switchblades or balisongs (butterfly knives). [...] Local jurisdictions including cities and counties may also restrict the ownership or carrying of gravity knives.|$|E
50|$|A {{deadly weapon}} per se is usually {{defined as a}} firearm and may include knives of a certain length (usually three inches or longer, {{depending}} on jurisdiction). Statutes list weapons such as switchblade, <b>gravity</b> <b>knife,</b> ballistic knife, stiletto, sword, dagger, blackjack, brass knuckles, nunchaku (fighting sticks), shuriken (throwing stars), among others.|$|E
5000|$|... (b) any knife {{which has}} a blade which is {{released}} from the handle or sheath thereof {{by the force of}} gravity or the application of centrifugal force and which, when released, is locked in place by means of a button, spring, lever, or other device, sometimes known as a <b>gravity</b> <b>knife,</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|The Arms Act defines {{weapons as}} [...] "objects that {{by their very}} nature are {{intended}} to reduce or eliminate the defensive ability of a person through direct impact", specifically including all firearms. Consequently, certain knives are considered [...] "weapons" [...] in accordance with this definition. Except for firearms, however, which are heavily regulated, such [...] "weapons", including automatic opening lock-blade knives (switchblades), OTF automatic <b>knives,</b> balisongs, and <b>gravity</b> <b>knives</b> are implicitly permitted under the Arms Act, and thus may be bought, possessed and carried by anyone over the age of 18 who has not been expressively banned from owning any weapon (Waffenverbot) by the civilian authorities.|$|R
50|$|Some {{civilian}} <b>gravity</b> OTF <b>knives</b> {{have a small}} {{helper spring}} to kick out the blade. This partial spring drive {{is not sufficient to}} classify this type of knife as a switchblade, because it does not drive the blade out to full lock.|$|R
50|$|All large side-opening switchblade knives (blade {{longer than}} 8.5 cm), OTF switchblades, balisongs or {{butterfly}} knives (blade longer than 4 cm), and <b>gravity</b> <b>knives</b> are illegal to own, {{import or export}} under German law. Side-opening switchblade knives with single-edged blades not longer than 8.5 cm and incorporating a continuous spine are legal to own. Legal switchblades may be carried both open and concealed on one's person {{if there is a}} justified need for it ("berechtigtes Bedürfnis") or if the weapon cannot be accessed with less than 3 moves ("Transport in verschlossenem Behältnis"). Other laws or regulations may still prohibit the carrying of otherwise legal automatic or switchblade knives, particularly in certain situations or places (gatherings on public ground, check-in areas of airports).|$|R
5000|$|The Restriction of Offensive Weapons Act 1959, {{which took}} effect 13 June 1959, {{specifies}} {{that anyone who}} [...] "manufactures, sells or hires or offers for sale or hire, or exposes or has in his possession {{for the purpose of}} sale or hire or lends or gives to any other person" [...] an automatic-opening knife (flick knife) or <b>gravity</b> <b>knife</b> in England, Wales and Scotland is guilty of an offence. Importation of such knives into the United Kingdom after 13 June 1959 is prohibited. Under a strict interpretation of the Act, it is legal to possess an automatic-opening or <b>gravity</b> <b>knife</b> made before 13 June 1959 if it is held by the original owner within the home or other private place and is not transferred to any other person. As the penalty provisions of the Act apply to the prior owner of the knife, and not to the inheritor or subsequent purchaser, it is possible that a person living in the UK could acquire an automatic-opening or <b>gravity</b> <b>knife</b> and keep it at home or on other private property without penalty to the new owner, though a zealous prosecutor might attempt to level a charge of abetting or facilitating an offence by the knife's former owner as a consequence of acquiring the knife in a prohibited post-1959 transaction.|$|E
50|$|A roll-lock knife {{is a type}} of sliding {{knife in}} which the blade rides on a track running the length of the scales, tilting into a detent to lock open or closed. Examples would be the Bench Mark Rollox, or its {{licensed}} derivative, the CRKT Rollock. Sliding knives like the Rollox are not considered inertia or <b>gravity</b> <b>knife.</b>|$|E
5000|$|An {{automatic}} OTF {{knife blade}} travels within an internal track or channel {{in the same}} manner as a manual slider or <b>gravity</b> <b>knife.</b> But the automatic main spring drive and button mechanism enclosed within requires a switchblade handle to be thicker or longer than a similar size gravity or sliding knife. The term [...] "Slider" [...] is usually not applied ...|$|E
40|$|This Article is {{the first}} {{scholarly}} analysis of knives and the Second Amendment. Under the Supreme Court’s standard in District of Columbia v. Heller, knives are Second Amendment “arms” because they are “typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes,” including self-defense. There is no knife that is more dangerous than a modern handgun; to the contrary, knives are much less dangerous. Therefore, restrictions on carrying handguns set the upper limit for restrictions on carrying knives. Prohibitions on carrying knives in general, or of particular knives, are unconstitutional. For example, bans of knives that open in a convenient way (e. g., switchblades, <b>gravity</b> <b>knives,</b> and butterfly knives) are unconstitutional. Likewise unconstitutional are bans on folding knives that, after being opened, have a safety lock to prevent inadvertent closure...|$|R

50|$|In Denmark, fixed-blade knives {{are legal}} to own if the blade {{is no longer}} than 12 cm (4.75 inches). Blades over this length may only be legally owned if the {{possessor}} has a legitimate reason for carrying the knife or a special collector's permit. However, such knives are still generally illegal to carry in public, whether on one's person or in a vehicle, unless transported {{in such a manner}} as to prevent ready access by the owner (lockbox, locked trunk, etc.) Folding, non-lock blade knives are legal to carry if the blade length does not exceed 7 cm (2.756 in). Locking knives and knives over 7 cm must be transported in public so as not to allow ready access by the owner. Knives with blades that may be opened with one hand (even if the one-hand opening mechanism has been removed), automatic-opening knives (switchblades), push daggers, <b>gravity</b> <b>knives,</b> disguised knives (belt-buckle knife, sword cane, etc.) and knives with ready access by the wearer (neck or belt knives, boot knives, etc.) are illegal to own or possess. Multi-tools featuring one-hand opening blades are also illegal to own or possess. Owning throwing knives and throwing in private or public is subject to permissions.|$|R
