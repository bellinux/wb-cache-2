5|$|Of {{the many}} studies on behavior-based early <b>intervention</b> <b>programs,</b> most are case reports {{of up to}} five {{participants}} and typically examine a few problem behaviors such as self-injury, aggression, noncompliance, stereotypies, or spontaneous language; unintended side effects are largely ignored. Despite the popularity of social skills training, its effectiveness is not firmly established. A randomized controlled study of a model for training parents in problem behaviors in their children with AS showed that parents attending a one-day workshop or six individual lessons reported fewer behavioral problems, while parents receiving the individual lessons reported less intense behavioral problems in their AS children. Vocational training is important to teach job interview etiquette and workplace behavior to older children and adults with AS, and organization software and personal data assistants can improve the work and life management of people with AS.|$|E

40|$|Background: Despite the {{emerging}} {{body of research}} on the potential of physical activity to improve learning and academic achievement, conclusive evidence regarding the effects of physical activity on academic achievement is lacking. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the impact of a physical activity <b>intervention</b> <b>program</b> on academic performance. Methods: A controlled cross-sectional design was used to investigate the hypothesis that the <b>intervention</b> <b>program</b> would increase the proportion of students in grade 5 who achieved the national learning goals in Swedish, mathematics, and English compared with 3 reference schools. Academic results from the years prior to and during the <b>intervention</b> <b>program</b> were analyzed. Logistic regression analyses assessed the odds of achieving the national learning goals when the <b>intervention</b> <b>program</b> was integrated into the elementary curricula. Results: Higher proportions of students in the intervention school achieved the national goals in all 3 subjects compared with the reference schools after initiation of the <b>intervention</b> <b>program.</b> The odds for achieving the national learning goals in the intervention school increased 2 -fold (p[*]<[*]. 05), whereas these odds either did not change or decreased in the reference schools.

25|$|Behavior {{therapy is}} a rich tradition. It is well {{researched}} with a strong evidence base. Its roots are in behaviorism. In behavior therapy, environmental events predict {{the way we think}} and feel. Our behavior sets up conditions for the environment to feedback back on it. Sometimes the feedback leads the behavior to increase- reinforcement and sometimes the behavior decreases- punishment. Oftentimes behavior therapists are called applied behavior analysis. They have studied many areas from developmental disabilities to depression and anxiety disorders. In the area of mental health and addictions a recent article looked at APA's list for well established and promising practices and found a considerable number of them based on the principles of operant and respondent conditioning. Multiple assessment techniques have come from this approach including functional analysis (psychology), which has found a strong focus in the school system. In addition, multiple <b>intervention</b> <b>programs</b> have come from this tradition including community reinforcement approach for treating addictions, acceptance and commitment therapy, functional analytic psychotherapy, including dialectic behavior therapy and behavioral activation. In addition, specific techniques such as contingency management and exposure therapy have come from this tradition.|$|E

The general aim of the study was to use psychological skills and psychological techniques to enhance the mental toughness of secondary school cricketers, within a psycho-educational framework. This general aim of the study was actualised by employing the following specific aims: • A literature review was conducted to explore the psycho-educational model. It was found that the psycho-educational model was an appropriate model to use as the framework of the <b>intervention</b> <b>program.</b> • The literature review investigated and evaluated different psychological skills and psychological techniques that influenced the mental toughness of cricketers positively. • A questionnaire was designed. This questionnaire (CMTQ) fulfilled the role of a psychological skills measuring tool. • A psycho-educational <b>intervention</b> <b>program</b> was designed around the findings of the literature study. • Guidelines were compiled to follow when coaching mental toughness to secondary school cricketers. • The <b>intervention</b> <b>program</b> was presented over a six week period. • An empirical study was conducted to evaluate the successfulness of the <b>intervention</b> <b>program.</b> The first phase of the empirical study was done before the presentation of the psycho-educational <b>intervention</b> <b>program.</b> The data suggest that Confidence and Motivation were the two main psychological skills that the participants employed in their mental game of cricket. The second phase of the empirical study was only done after the completion of the six week <b>intervention</b> <b>program.</b> The selected data analysis method employed to evaluate the effectiveness of the program was the t-test for dependant groups. v The results of the data analysis indicated that the participants in the experimental group improved in their mental toughness performance significantly.
