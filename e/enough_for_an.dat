The duo produced the tracks without plans to release an album. After working on projects that {{were intended to}} be separate singles over five months, they considered the material good <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> album.|$|E

Four stands (two at each terminal is size code D (large <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> Airbus A330 or a Boeing 757), while 20 are for size category C (large <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> Airbus A320 or Boeing 737). Domestic jets normally use the seven jetbridge stands (gates 30–37), while the five non-bridged gates at Terminal A (gates 25–29) {{are used for}} domestic regional aircraft. International flights all use the eight non-bridged gates at Terminal B (gates 42-49). The Air Force has six stands for military freight planes up {{to the size of}} a Lockheed C-5 Galaxy (code F), although one is permanently used for deicing.|$|E
5|$|Bushnell {{had also}} played Spacewar during the 1960s {{and wanted to}} make an arcade game version of it, but had gone in a {{different}} technological direction. He and Ted Dabney had initially started with a US$4,000 Data General Nova computer which they thought would be powerful enough to run multiple simultaneous games of Spacewar; when {{it turned out to}} not be, they had started investigating replacing the computer hardware with custom-built parts. They had soon discovered that while a general-purpose computer cheap <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> arcade game would not be powerful enough to run enough games of Spacewar to be profitable, a computer purpose-built for solely running one game could be made for as low as US$100. By August 1971 when Bushnell called Tuck and Pitts, he and Dabney had already displayed a prototype of their Computer Space game in a bar near Stanford and had found a commercial manufacturer for the game in Nutting Associates. They were curious about what Tuck and Pitts had done to make a commercially competitive version of the game, but were relieved, though also somewhat disappointed, to find that they had not solved that problem yet.|$|E

5|$|In 1846 the Mexican–American War began. Davis {{resigned}} his House seat {{in early}} June {{and raised a}} volunteer regiment, the 155th Infantry Regiment, becoming its colonel {{under the command of}} his former father-in-law, General Zachary Taylor. On July 21 the regiment sailed from New Orleans for Texas. Colonel Davis sought to arm his regiment with the M1841 Mississippi rifle. At this time, smoothbore muskets were still the primary infantry weapon, and any unit with rifles was considered special and designated as such. President James K. Polk had promised Davis the weapons if he would remain in Congress long <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> important vote on the Walker tariff. General Winfield Scott objected on the basis that the weapons were insufficiently tested. Davis insisted and called in his promise from Polk, and his regiment was armed with the rifles, making it particularly effective in combat. The regiment became known as the Mississippi Rifles {{because it was the first}} to be fully armed with these new weapons. The incident was the start of a lifelong feud between Davis and Scott.|$|E
5|$|Route S3 {{was defined}} in 1929 {{to run from}} Route 3 in East Rutherford west to Route 6 (US46) in Clifton, (this {{is now part of}} Route 3). In 1942, the state took over the {{alignment}} and made it an unnumbered state highway was defined to run from the intersection of Clifton Avenue and Van Houten Avenue southwest to Route S3, which then ran along Allwood Road. World War II delayed completion of Route S3 long <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> alternate freeway route to be selected, and the part of Allwood Road that was taken over is no longer a state highway. In 1948, the route was assigned the number Route S3 Spur. The number was changed to Route 161 in the 1953 state highway renumbering, and ever since then it has remained an isolated state highway.|$|E
5|$|With the CSBS the {{sighting}} system and calculator {{were the same}} device, which required the bombsight to be fairly large. With this restriction removed, the sight head was much smaller and lighter than the older versions. The resulting sight head was easy to mount on a stabilizer system, adapted from the same Sperry gyroscope as earlier experiments. With the sight head stabilized, the bomb aimer could continue to measure drift even as he indicated turns to the pilot, eliminating the need to correct, re-measure and correct again. The remote console and second operator eliminated {{the need for the}} bomb aimer to look away from the sights, to make adjustments while on the bomb run. As a result of these changes, short aiming periods of a few seconds would be <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> accurate drop.|$|E

5|$|The WAC preseason polls were {{released}} on October 29, and Louisiana Tech was predicted to finish {{sixth in the}} media poll and fifth in the coaches poll. Fellow senior Gibson {{was named to the}} preseason All-WAC second team, but Rolle was not honored by any preseason award. In the Bulldogs' home opener against Arkansas-Little Rock, Rolle was the leader in scoring with 23 points in crushing the Trojans 86–66. Gibson and Olu Ashaolu also scored more than 20 points to push Louisiana Tech to a 4–1 start, their best since 2001. Rolle's career high in points was 29, scored against Houston in a 99–94 defeat of the Cougars on December 29; Rolle also grabbed 10 boards. In the semifinal of the WAC tournament, against the #1 seeded Utah State Aggies, Rolle injured his ankle less than three minutes into the game, a factor in the Bulldogs' 30-point loss. They finished the regular season 23–10, including a 9–7 record in conference. That was good <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> invitation to the 2010 CollegeInsider.com Tournament (CIT), in which Louisiana Tech defeated Southern Miss in the first round despite missing Rolle. In Rolle's final collegiate game, he contributed nine points off the bench despite a 69–40 rout of the Bulldogs by Missouri State in the CIT's quarterfinals.|$|E

When the Tunku rejected this, many of Lim's supporters resigned, and ran in the election as independents, which cost the Alliance some seats.|$|E

Southern and London Midland stopping services generally use platforms 5 and 6 on the Slow lines but all can use either pair of platforms when needed since the four Main Line platforms were lengthened to take 12-coach trains. Platform 2 on the Up DC line has unusually been maintained at a length of 182m rather than the usual DC line length of around 125m, long <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> 8-coach train; on rare past occasions in recent years involving total closure of the Fast and Slow lines, main line trains have been diverted over the DC line between Watford Junction and Euston but without stopping at intermediate stations.|$|E
25|$|On 2 December, {{at about}} 4a.m., Achilles {{was in the}} {{latitude}} of San Domingo when lookouts saw a large vessel sailing towards them.

The French vessel thought that it was dealing with a lightly-manned merchant vessel and attempted to put boarders on Achilles. After about three-quarters of an hour Achilles was in a position for the Dutch soldiers hidden below deck to come out and board the French vessel. The Anglo-German boarding party quickly cleared the French deck and took command of the vessel.|$|E
