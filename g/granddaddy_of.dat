25|$|Työmies (The Worker) (July 1903 – August 1950) — The <b>granddaddy</b> <b>of</b> the Finnish-American radical {{press was}} Työmies, {{established}} in Worcester, Massachusetts in 1903 as Amerikan Suomalainen Työmies (The Finnish-American Worker). In June 1904 the publication {{was moved to}} the small town of Hancock, located in the sparsely populated Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The paper remained in that location for a decade before moving to the comparative metropolis of Superior, Wisconsin, a virtual twin city of Duluth, Minnesota. From its earliest days, Työmies was a Marxist publication, significantly more radical than its East Coast counterpart established in January 1905, Raivaaja (The Pioneer). The paper briefly published an English-language paper called Wage Slave, and was the source of a number of annual magazines in the Finnish language. During its Communist Party phase, which began in about 1920, the circulation of the daily fluctuated in the range of 13,000 to 15,000 copies, declining to around 5,000 in 1950, at which time it was consolidated with the CPUSA's East Coast Finnish-language newspaper, Eteenpäin, to form Työmies-Eteenpäin (see below).|$|E

Its use of colour graphics and individualised antagonists were considered [...] "strong evolutionary concepts" [...] among space ship games. That same year saw {{the release of}} SNK's debut shoot 'em up Ozma Wars, notable for being the first action game to feature a supply of energy, resembling a life bar, a mechanic that has now become common {{in the majority of}} modern action games. It also featured vertically scrolling backgrounds and enemies.|$|E
500|$|When it opened, {{the turnpike}} {{became the first}} long-distance limited-access road in the United States. It {{provided}} a direct link between the Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern states, and cut travel time between Pittsburgh and Harrisburg from nearly six to about two-and-a-half hours. The road was given the nicknames [...] "dream highway" [...] and [...] "the World's Greatest Highway" [...] by the turnpike commission, and was also known as [...] "the <b>Granddaddy</b> <b>of</b> the Pikes." [...] Postcards and other souvenirs promoted the original stretch's seven tunnels through the Appalachians.|$|E

40|$|Back in the 1970 s and 1980 s, Toyota Motor's {{image in}} the United States {{was one of a}} reliable, yet cheap, carmaker. If you had little money, but wanted minimal {{breakdowns}} with the vehicle that you drove to work every day, you bought a Toyota. Thanks to the introduction of the automaker's Lexus line in the 1990 s, that image has now changed. The Lexus brand is now synonymous with the world of luxury, even though car enthusiasts and purists would argue that Lexus is more of a middle-market luxury car line. However, Lexus sales surpassed Mercedes Benz and Cadillac sales-the two <b>granddaddies</b> <b>of</b> luxury cars-in the United States quite easily, thanks to Toyota's brilliant and methodical marketing strategy. The firm's philosophy of conducting meticulous research over much time and money has been widely admired and studied by other automakers and college students alike and has cemented Toyota's position {{as one of the most}} successful carmakers in the world. For a firm that entered the luxury car market late in the game, how did Toyota jump over its competition? What was the difference in strategy between its domestic rivals Honda and Nissan and its U. S. competitors, like Ford and General Motors? To answer these questions, the Center on Japanese Economy and Business of Columbia Business School invited Chester Dawson, editor at Business Week magazine and author of a new book, Lexus: The Relentless Pursuit to speak on September 22...|$|R
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1899, Calpurnia Virginia Tate is about to turn twelve and worries about the adult {{responsibilities}} that loom on the horizon. She would much rather swim in the river near her family's pecan plantation just outside {{the tiny town of}} Fentress, Texas than learn to cook, knit, and play the piano. One day, noticing two different types of grasshoppers in the lawn around the house, Callie decides to find a copy of Charles Darwin's infamous book The Origin of Species. After a disastrous encounter with a lady librarian, Callie is forced to search for the illicit book elsewhere. Little does she {{know that there is a}} copy in her very own house in the personal library <b>of</b> her <b>Granddaddy.</b> An imposing and distant figure, Callie must work up her courage to ask him about her grasshopper conundrum and relay her own theory about why the grasshoppers around the house are two different sizes. This begins an easy sort of friendship between granddaughter and grandfather. Soon Callie is spending most of her time with <b>Granddaddy,</b> catching specimens <b>of</b> wildlife for his collection and learning about natural sciences at his side.|$|R
500|$|The film also {{received}} mixed reviews from other critics. Ananda Vikatan said, [...] "Though {{this effort to}} improve the quality of Tamil cinema must be appreciated, we do not see the dignity of the epic and only see the dominance of the extravaganza." [...] In 2012, Baradwaj Rangan called the film [...] "a historical epic with little so-called relevance to contemporary life (unless you want to acknowledge the Duryodhana-Karna storyline as the <b>granddaddy</b> <b>of</b> today's bromances)" [...] and stated that Ganesan's performance [...] "isn't as all-consuming as his performance in, say, The Mahabharata, after all, is a tale with an ensemble cast, unlike The Ramayana with its solo hero", while calling Rama Rao's performance a [...] "sly, campy take on Krishna".|$|E

40|$|This {{is a short}} book of essays, some {{published}} {{before and}} some not, mostly on the pleasures and problems of the amateur historian. Taken together, the essays also reflect C. L. Sonnichsen 2 ̆ 7 s attempt to develop a definition of good historical writing. Unfortunately, {{while most of the}} book 2 ̆ 7 s pages are filled with good, common-sense advice for beginning researchers and writers, the whole is burdened by the author 2 ̆ 7 s jaundiced view of the academic historical profession. The essays introduce the neophyte to the editors, librarians, and reviewers who populate his new world, and gently point out that librarians do not have the leisure to do his research for him, that journal editors may rewrite his prose, and that Knopf is not likely to publish his account <b>of</b> <b>granddaddy</b> 2 ̆ 7 s ranch. All in all, the sections of the book on the amateur portray the. history buff as a conscientious, cooperative soul, interested mainly in entertaining by preserving the past. But even here, jarring notes intrude. There is a pervasive defensiveness, an expectation of rejection, expressed toward academics and publishers. This undertone becomes dominant whenever the author focuses on professional history. Sonnichsen begins with the proposition that professionals agree that 2 ̆ 2 their discipline is sick-perhaps unto death. 2 ̆ 2 This astounding statement is based on sometimes contradictory self-criticisms by various historians, ranging from Oscar Handlin 2 ̆ 7 s Mandarin traditionalism to James Henretta 2 ̆ 7 s call for interdisciplinary conceptualizations, but the main point the author extracts from his sources is that academic historians talk too much to the initiated and far too little to anyone else. He adds to the indictment by scoring the profession for a stifling commitment to objectivity and for refusing to cross disciplinary bounds. The latter is at the expense of depth of understanding, the former, {{at the expense of the}} 2 ̆ 2 poetry 2 ̆ 2. -the excitement, the emotion, the deep feeling for the past-the author sees as central to historical writing. So he comes up with a stereotype of the scholar: dull, pedantic, and narrow. Like many stereotypes, this one contains some truth, but Sonnichsen shows no understanding of the teaching component of published scholarship, no recognition that there may be little 2 ̆ 2 poetry 2 ̆ 2 in important discoveries about the past, no real grasp of the range of approaches used by academic historians, and no acknowledgement of the professional 2 ̆ 7 s role in clearing away the mythology that has contorted our view of the frontier West. It follows that the author 2 ̆ 7 s view of good history is the obverse of that he sees practiced by professionals. The ambidextrous historian of the title-identified by the jacket blurb with the author-is his ideal. Unfettered by disciplinary limitations, free of the shibboleths of scholarship, he is, presumably, able to pursue the poetry of history. If this ideal is construed to include respect for good writing, a willingness to use a variety of tools to uncover the past, and the belief that the whole process is important, then it is a good one and one that is pursued by professionals as well as amateurs. Unfortunately, people reading this book might lose sight of that fact...|$|R

Oklahoma was invited to the National Championship game. Because the Longhorns were not conference champions, their next bowl game would be arbitrarily picked, and the outcome heavily depended on the play of other teams. Texas would eventually gain an automatic bid to a BCS bowl game {{by virtue of its}} [...] #4 BCS ranking (the top four BCS teams are guaranteed spots in a BCS bowl game if the first three teams are conference champions).
