40|$|Cell-centered {{finite volume}} methods are {{prevailing}} in numerical simulation of flow in porous media. However, {{due to the}} lack of cell-centered finite volume methods for mechanics, coupled flow and deformation is usually treated either by coupled finite-volume-finite element discretizations, or within a finite element setting. The former approach is unfavorable as it introduces two separate grid structures, while the latter approach loses the advantages of finite volume methods for the flow equation. Recently, we proposed a cell-centered finite volume method for elasticity. Herein, we explore the applicability of this novel method to provide a compatible finite volume discretization for coupled <b>hydromechanic</b> flows in porous media. We detail in particular the issue of coupling terms, and show how this is naturally handled. Furthermore, we observe how the cell-centered finite volume framework naturally allows for modeling fractured and fracturing porous media through internal boundary conditions. We support the discussion with a set of numerical examples: the convergence properties of the coupled scheme are first investigated; second, we illustrate the practical applicability of the method both for fractured and heterogeneous media...|$|R

40|$|In this contribution, {{a finite}} element model for {{simulating}} coupled <b>hydromechanic</b> and electrokinetic flow in a multiphase domain is introduced. Emphasis is placed on modelling CO 2 flow in a deformed, unsaturated fractured geological formation and its associated streaming potential flow.

This scheme is formulated {{on the basis of}} the standard Galerkin finite element method (SG), the extended finite element method (XFEM), the level-set method (LS) and the Petrov–Galerkin method (PG). This technique is suitable for advective dominant flow, typically existing in fractured domains. The standard Galerkin finite element method is utilized to discretize the deformation and the diffusive dominant field equations, and the extended finite element method, together with the level-set method and the Petrov-Galerkin method, is utilized to discretize the advective dominant field equations [1].

50|$|While the TR-77 was developed, from 1974 the Romanian {{engineers}} continued work on {{a reverse}} engineered version of the 800-horsepower MTU Leopard 1 engine and transmission.

Also, the <b>hydromechanic</b> transmission was designed by the ICSITEM research institute from Bucharest based on an available model and produced by Hidromecanica Braşov factory, thus completing the T-block powerpack. The engine and transmission were designed between 1974 and 1982, using foreign technology.

Based on a configurable commercial grid generator, modules have been developed facilitating i) the import of standardised geometry from a CAD system, ii) easy and fast generation of standard BFC grids for ship hulls based on a comparatively small number of input paramters and iii) the generation of smooth contour fit surface meshes used as input to further 3 -d grid development for RANSE calculations as well as wave resistance codes based on potential theory. The project compares results obtained on several grids and indicates necessary improvements. (orig.)

50|$|The {{original}} TR-85 was {{powered by}} the 830 horsepower 8VS-A2T2, 4 stroke, 8-cylinder, liquid-cooled, turbo charged direct injection diesel engine, and a six speed (four forward, two reverse) THM-5800 <b>hydromechanic</b> transmission (engaging under load, one power flow in straight run and two power flows in turs with planetary final transmission), giving it a governed top speed of 50 km/h on paved roads. The TR-85M1 has an improved version of the original engine. The new 8VS-A2T2M provides 860 horsepower and has a top road speed of 60 km/h. However, because {{the weight of the}} tank increased from 42 tons to 50 tons, the power-to-weight ratio has been reduced from 19.7 to 17.2 hp/tonne.

40|$|Offshore wind {{turbines}} are growing significantly {{to become a}} cost-effective alternative for the offshore oil and gas market. This causes rapid growth of offshore wind turbine foundations (monopiles). Currently, monopiles are installed using jack-up vessels like Aeolus. However operations will be limited by crane capacity and its cost-effectiveness is subject to discussion. Therefore floating vessels are preferred for future monopile installation; although {{little is known about}} the interaction between ship and monopile during the pile driving process. This research focusses on the multi-body behaviour of a floating structure connected to a monopile which is partly penetrated in the seabed. Frequency domain calculations are performed in combination with spectral analyses to investigate floating monopile installation with HLV Svanen and a monohull concept. It is shown that the natural period of the multi-body system shifts towards the working conditions (wave period) of HLV Svanen. Therefore pile release is advised to avoid resonance during monopile installation. It is concluded that increasing scale of monopiles hardly affects the performance of HLV Svanen, while a monohull concept does not significantly improve the performance of floating monopile installation. However a new gripper design should be introduced to ensure structural integrity of the upscaling monopiles.

Therefore, intracorporeal energy harvesting {{has the potential}} {{to reduce the number of}} surgical interventions by extending the life cycle of active devices. Given the accumulated experience with intravascular devices such as stents, heart valves, and cardiac assist devices, the idea to harvest a small fraction of the hydraulic energy available in the cardiovascular circulation is revisited. The aim of this article is to explore the technical feasibility of harvesting 1 [*]mW electric power using a miniature hydrodynamic turbine powered by about 1 % of the cardiac output flow in a peripheral artery. To this end, numerical modelling of the fluid mechanics and experimental verification of the overall performance of a 1 : 1 scale friction turbine are performed in vitro. The numerical flow model is validated for a range of turbine configurations and flow conditions (up to 250 [*]mL/min) in terms of <b>hydromechanic</b> efficiency; up to 15 % could be achieved with the nonoptimized configurations of the study. Although this article does not entail the clinical feasibility of intravascular turbines in terms of hemocompatibility and impact on the circulatory system, the numerical model does provide first estimates of the mechanical shear forces relevant to blood trauma and platelet activation.

40|$|Pulsus paradoxus is {{an exaggeration}} {{of the normal}} inspiratory {{decrease}} in systolic blood pressure. Despite a century of attempts to explain this sign consensus is still lacking. To solve the controversy and reveal the exact mechanism, we reexamined the characteristic anatomic arrangement of the circulation system {{in the chest and}} designed these mechanical models based on related <b>hydromechanic</b> principles. Model 1 was designed to observe the primary influence of respiratory intrathoracic pressure change (RIPC) on systemic and pulmonary venous return systems (SVR and PVR) respectively. Model 2, as an equivalent mechanical model of septal swing, was to study the secondary influence of RIPC on the motion of the interventriclar septum (IVS), which might be the direct cause for pulsus paradoxus. Model 1 demonstrated that the simulated RIPC had different influence on the simulated SVR and PVR. It increased the volume of the simulated right ventricle (SRV) when the internal pressure was kept constant (8. 16 cmH 2 O), while it had the opposite effect on PVR. Model 2 revealed the three major factors determining the respiratory displacement of IVS in normal and different pathophysiological conditions: the magnitude of RIPC, the pressure difference between the two ventricles and the intrapericardial pressure. Our models demonstrate that the different anatomical arrangement of the two venous return systems leads to a different effect of RIPC on right and left ventricles, and thus a pressure gradient across IVS that tends to shift IVS left- and rightwards. When the leftward displacement of IVS reaches a considerable amplitude in some pathologic condition such as cardiac tamponade, the pulsus paradoxus occurs...|$|R
