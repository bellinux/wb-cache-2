40|$|ABSTRACT: Due to the {{industrial}} development in Taiwan, there is inconsistency between the university’s cultivation on highly-trained engineers and those demanded by the high-tech industry. In order to remain competitive, the implementation of <b>international</b> <b>accreditation</b> <b>standards</b> in Taiwan has become an urgent need, which will facilitate the acceptance of domestically-trained engineers on the global market. Through a careful literature review, this paper first summarizes the crucial events in engineering education {{that led to the}} evolution of engineering education in Taiwan. Next, this paper describes the formation and implementing processes of the <b>international</b> <b>accreditation</b> criteria in Taiwan. Such criteria are expected to be “substantially equivalent ” to those adopted by the international bodies, such as the Washington Accord Signatories.

40|$|Background Councils of Chiropractic Education (CCE) {{indirectly}} influence {{patient care}} and safety through their role of ensuring {{the standards of}} training delivered by chiropractic educational institutions. This is achieved by a process of accreditation where CCEs define and assess graduate competencies and educational standards. A previous study comparing CCE graduate competencies found variations between the CCE jurisdictions. It was proffered that variations in standards may potentially compromise patient care and safety and also inter-jurisdictional mutual recognition. This study continues the examination of CCEs by looking for similarities and differences in CCE <b>accreditation</b> <b>standards.</b> There were two purposes of this review. The first was to compare the <b>accreditation</b> <b>standards,</b> domains of <b>accreditation</b> <b>standards,</b> and components of the domains of <b>accreditation</b> <b>standards</b> as represented by the domains of “Mission, goals, vision, objectives”, “Resources”, “Faculty/Academic staff”, “Educational program/curriculum”. In addition, we compared the <b>accreditation</b> <b>standards</b> between CCEs {{and those of the}} widely accepted medical <b>accreditation</b> <b>standards</b> of the World Federation of Medical Education (WFME), in order to search for deficiencies and opportunities for improvements in these standards. The second purpose was to make recommendations, if significant deficiencies or variations were found. Method We undertook a systematic review of the similarities and differences between five CCEs’ definitions of an <b>accreditation</b> <b>standard</b> and the descriptive lists of <b>accreditation</b> <b>standards</b> they have adopted. CCE selection criteria and data selection method were undertaken in a systematic manner. This information was tabulated for a comparative analysis and took place in April 2016. Results Only two CCEs had a definition of the term “accreditation / educational standard”. At the domain level there was considerably more similarities than differences. The differences became more apparent when the comparisons were made at the component level. These included intended purposes of the mission statement, standards for faculty staff, requirements for clinical training by students, program budgetary autonomy and transparency, the inclusion of chiropractic philosophy and history, and which subjects should be taught in basic, behavioural and clinical sciences. Conclusions A series of recommendations were made. These included the need for an increased clarity of the required basic and clinical science subjects, teaching clinic student requirements, and faculty staff qualifications. These are proposed with the intention of creating uniform and high quality <b>international</b> <b>accreditation</b> <b>standards</b> for chiropractic education. Future research should compare the levels of CCEs inspection standards and processes to see if similarities and differences exist also there...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} local or {{regional}} undergraduate examination form – the synopsis-based oral examination (S-BOE), {{as it is}} deployed in {{both large and small}} international management education programs at a Scandinavian business school. The S-BOE format is designed to assess student cognitive achievement in light of specified learning objectives through a focused presentation and dialogue involving an examiner and qualified censor, the latter being formally present to ensure process fairness for both examiner and student. It affords the examiner and censor the opportunity to explore student cognitive skills over the known range: unistructural > multistructural > relational > extended abstract (Biggs, J. 1999). Individuals as well as student project groups may be assessed using this approach. Administrative costs do not significantly exceed that of other course assessment formats: written reports or in-class group examinations. There are also interesting learning efficiencies; practitioner experience, reflection, and dialogue with students suggest that all students experience this examination format as a learning experience in itself, over a range of course-related knowledge issues and interpersonal skilling. Exemplary students manifest “dramatic knowledge” in those instances when they creatively display a comprehensive, reflective, and reflexive understanding of course material in presentation and subsequent intersubjective dialogue. The authors discuss important features of this undergraduate examination format that remain largely overlooked and under-appreciated in terms that regionally and locally contextualize <b>international</b> <b>accreditation</b> <b>standards</b> and process. At a time when economic, efficiency, and standardization concerns increasingly pressure educational institutions to adopt testing methods that are psychologically “distant” in respect to the instructor-student relationship, the synopsis-based oral examination is an interesting alternative suitable for small as well as large academic programs...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the position of}} children who donate regenerative tissue to potentially {{save the life of}} another. The great good that can come about through their participation is at the cost of the donor child undergoing physically invasive and unnecessary medical procedures. The non-therapeutic element of a child’s involvement brings about legal and ethical issues that are the subject of this thesis. The central aim of this thesis is to determine if Australian child donors are treated appropriately and are sufficiently protected in acting as tissue donors, and whether a new regulatory response is needed for their benefit. The research engages with the ethical literature and legal analysis, and complements these theoretical perspectives with a qualitative analysis of interviews with medical professionals who are experienced in dealing with child donors. This research demonstrates that domestic regulation – in the form of law and professional guidelines – has had little influence on how donor children are treated in clinical practice. Until recently, the practical safeguards offered to protect donor children from physical and psychological harm also varied between hospitals and were often limited in nature. However, there has been a recent trend towards improved, standardised care for Australian donor children due, primarily, to a desire to conform to <b>international</b> <b>accreditation</b> <b>standards.</b> Two conclusions are reached: first, donor children have, to date, not been sufficiently protected – either theoretically in law or practically through consistent national treatment; and, second, existing domestic regulation has failed to effectively regulate this area. I recommend implementing a new domestic regulatory response to benefit Australian donor children. There is a need to provide donor children with more attention, to listen to them more and for them to be consistently treated around the country. To achieve this, engagement with the medical profession is essential. Access is restricted to staff and students of the University of Sydney. UniKey credentials are required.

Improving quality and safety in health care organizations is assured through accreditation. To evaluate patient safety in Farabi Eye Hospital by Joint Commission <b>International</b> (JCI) <b>accreditation</b> <b>standards</b> for quality improvement. Materials and Methods:This descriptive-analytical study was carried out in 2014. The data collection instrument was the translated version of JCI checklist, the validity of which was confirmed by a panel of Iranian experts. The data were obtained through interviews with all heads of departments (n= 80) and observation of documentation in each department by appraisers in Farabi Hospital. To analyze the data, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and Mann-Whitney U tests were run using SPSS Version 16. Results: The highest rate of compliance with JCI standards was 91. 1 %, pertaining to infection control and adopting an approach to reduce contamination. The lowest rate was associated with management monitoring of patients’ demographic information. In general, Farabi Eye Hospital observed the standards to a high level. Conclusion: Our findings exhibited that Farabi Eye Hospital is relatively efficient as to patient safety as a quality improvement factor. However, there were some shortcomings regarding some standards, which indicate deficient compliance with the JCI standards in this hospital.

Methods This descriptive research was conducted during year 2015. The population of the study included {{people involved in the}} establishment of <b>accreditation</b> <b>standards.</b> Sampling was conducted in the form of complete enumeration according to 36 <b>standards</b> of <b>accreditation.</b> The instrument used for data collection was the “Logical framework of Zachman”. Columns of framework consisted of people involved in conducting the work (Who), the purpose of the work (Why), strategy of the work (What), work time (When), and sub-system of doing work (Where) and way of doing work (How), and rows of framework included the view of hospital chief, director/assistants of hospital, officials and personnel. Test chi-square was used to compare between <b>accreditation</b> <b>standards</b> text and studied hospital gap. Descriptive statistical method was used for variables. Results People involved in doing work and sub-systems of doing work at the hospital were consistent with specified <b>accreditation</b> <b>standards.</b> In 27 % of the standards, time interval of doing work in the hospital was not conducted according to <b>accreditation</b> <b>standards.</b> In terms of way of doing work, 25 % of standards had not been established, and 26 % of them had been established incompletely.
