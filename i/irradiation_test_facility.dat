40|$|An {{artificial}} {{neural network}} {{has been used to}} model the irradiation hardening of lowactivation ferritic/martensitic steels. The data used to create the model span a range of displacement damage of 0 - 90 dpa, within a temperature range of 273 - 973 K and contain 1800 points. The trained model has been able to capture the non-linear dependence of yield strength on the chemical composition and irradiation parameters. The ability of the model to generalise on unseen data has been tested and regions within the input domain that are sparsely populated have been identified. These are the regions where future experiments could be focused. It is shown that this method of analysis, because of its ability to capture complex relationships between the many variables, could help in the design of maximally informative experiments on materials in future <b>irradiation</b> <b>test</b> <b>facilities.</b> This will accelerate the acquisition of the key missing knowledge to assist the materials choices in a future fusion power plant. ...|$|R

40|$|It is well {{established}} that the high fluences of fast neutrons likely to be encountered in the environments of fusion reactors or fusion materials <b>test</b> <b>facilities</b> will generate substantial quantities of helium (both {sup 4 }He and {sup 3 }He isotopes), and {{that the presence of}} this gas in bulk material can produce serious damage in engineering structures due to swelling. The present study was undertaken to survey the current status (as of early 2004) of the available fast neutron cross section information for helium production in several major structural elements of interest for the development of fusion energy systems. The scope of this study encompasses both compiled experimental cross section data and evaluated cross sections available from major nuclear data libraries used in the analysis of fusion systems. The main conclusion from this work is that the contemporary knowledge of those individual neutron reaction cross sections important for helium production is, in general, very inadequate for the purpose of producing reliable designs for fusion reactors (e. g., ITER) and materials <b>irradiation</b> <b>test</b> <b>facilities</b> (e. g., IFMIF). Since the number of distinct neutron reactions that must be considered is large, and the capabilities (both experimental and theoretical) of the nuclear physics community to adequately determine the cross sections for specific reactions is limited for various reasons, it is recommended, {{as a consequence of the}} present investigation, that an engineering approach be undertaken to provide the data needed for system design purposes. The suggested technical approach would involve irradiating small specimens of candidate materials in high fluence neutron fields whose spectra resemble as closely as possible those to be encountered in real fusion facilities, and that direct integrated yield measurements then be made of helium production in these samples, inclusive of all the contributing neutron reaction channels...|$|R

About 10, 000 sensors will be installed around the 26. 6 km LHC ring, and most of them will be exposed to high radiation doses during the accelerator lifetime.

For surface potential measurement, a small removable flat device based on the secondary electron spectrometer method has been developed and installed in the CEDRE <b>irradiation</b> <b>test</b> <b>facility</b> at ONERA (Toulouse, France). This technique was developed to get rid off specific issues inherent to the Kelvin Probe technique.

A calibration has been performed in order to validate this experimental setup. Furthermore, to optimise its efficiency, the physical behaviour of this device has been modelled and numerically simulated using Particle In Cell (PIC) model and a dedicated numerical code called SPIS (Spacecraft Plasma Interactions System). In a final step, electrical characterisations of a charged dielectric {{have been carried out}} under continuous electron irradiation with this new method.

40|$|Piezoelectric actuators, {{which are}} {{integrated}} into the cold tuning system and used to compensate the small mechanical deformations of the cavity wall induced by Lorentz forces due to the high electromagnetic surface field, may {{be located in the}} radiation environment during particle accelerator operation. In order to provide for a reliable operation of the accelerator, the performance and life time of piezoelectric actuators (~ 24. 000 units for ILC) should not show any significant degradation for long periods (i. e. machine life duration: ~ 20 years), even when subjected to intense radiation (i. e. gamma rays and fast neutrons). An experimental program, aimed at investigating the effect of fast neutrons radiation on the characteristics of piezoelectric actuators at liquid helium temperature (i. e. T~ 4. 2 K), was proposed for the working package WP# 8 devoted to tuners development in the frame of CARE project. A neutrons irradiation facility, already installed at the CERI cyclotron located at Orléans (France), was upgraded and adapted for actuators irradiations tests purpose. A deuterons beam (maximum energy and beam current: 25 MeV and 35 µA) collides with a thin (thickness: 3 mm) beryllium target producing a high neutrons flux with low gamma dose (~ 20 %) : a neutrons fluence of more than 1014 n/cm 2 is achieved in ~ 20 hours of exposure. A dedicated cryostat was developed at IPN Orsay and used previously for radiation hardness test of calibrated cryogenic thermometers and pressure transducers used in LHC superconducting magnets. This cryostat could be operated either with liquid helium or liquid argon. This irradiation facility was upgraded for allowing fast turn-over of experiments and a dedicated experimental set-up was designed, fabricated, installed at CERI and successfully operated for radiation hardness tests of several piezoelectric actuators at T~ 4. 2 K. This new apparatus allows on-line automatic measurements of actuators characteristics and the cryogenic parameters. Further, the test-cell and actuators are equipped with high purity Ni foils for measuring the total neutrons dose by an activation method.
