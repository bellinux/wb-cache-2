These systems require mathematical models of airplane performance in order to compute the optimal profiles.

This paper evaluates the cost and fuel penalties, trajectory variations, and flight control requirements associated with typical <b>idle</b> <b>engine</b> modeling errors for a twin-jet transport airplane.

40|$|Aircraft engine {{gearboxes}} represent one of {{the many}} critical systems/elements that require special attention for longer and safer operation. Reactive maintenance strategies are unsuitable as they usually imply higher repair costs when compared to condition based maintenance. This paper discusses the main prognostics and health management (PHM) approaches, describes a newly designed gearbox experimental facility and analyses preliminary data for gear prognosis. The test rig is designed to provide full capabilities of performing controlled experiments suitable for developing a reliable diagnostic and prognostic system. The rig is based on the accessory gearbox of the GE J 85 turbojet engine, which has been slightly modified and reconfigured to replicate real operating conditions such as speeds and loads. Defect to failure tests (DTFT) have been run to evaluate the performance of the rig as well as to assess prognostic metrics extracted from sensors installed on the gearbox casing (vibration and acoustic). The paper also details the main components of the rig and describes the various challenges encountered. Successful DTFT results were obtained during an <b>idle</b> <b>engine</b> performance test and prognostic metrics associated with the sensor suite were evaluated and discussed.

40|$|Imbalance in torque {{generation}} {{leads to}} engine speed fluctuation. To improve the <b>idle</b> <b>engine</b> speed performance, the torque balancing control problem is {{addressed in this}} paper for multi-cylinder SI engines. To evaluate cylinder-to-cylinder imbalance, the average torque in ignition-event scale is introduced as controlled output, which enables a feedback control to be performed without measurement of instantaneous torque, and the individual spark advances are chosen as control inputs. A linear discrete time model with single input and single output is proposed to represent {{the dynamics of the}} imbalance, where a sequentially switching function is introduced to describe the spark advance signals delivered to each cylinder and the differences in torque generation caused by the individual cylinder characteristics are equivalently modelled as unknown offset in the inputs. An estimation algorithm with the proof of convergence is presented to provide on-line estimation of the unknown offset under the passivity assumption of the system. Furthermore, a feedback control law which combines the unknown offset estimation and the model predictive control is proposed. Finally, the unknown offset estimation and the feedback control approach are validated based on the experimental results carried out on a six-cylinder gasoline engine test bench. 漏 Authors 2011...|$|E

40|$|Partially Premixed Combustion (PPC) {{is used to}} {{meet the}} {{increasing}} demands of emission legislation and to improve fuel efficiency. PPC with gasoline fuels {{have the advantage of}} a longer premixed duration of fuel/air mixture which prevents soot formation at higher loads. The objective {{of this paper is to}} investigate the degree of stratification for low load (towards <b>idle)</b> <b>engine</b> conditions using different injection strategies and negative valve overlap (NVO). The question is, how homogenous or stratified is the partially premixed combustion (PPC) for a given setting of NVO and fuel injection strategy. In this work PRF 55 has been used as PPC fuel. The experimental engine is a light duty (LD) diesel engine that has been modified to single cylinder operation to provide optical access into the combustion chamber, equipped with a fully variable valve train system. Hot residual gases were trapped by using NVO to dilute the cylinder mixture. Optical measurements were carried out for OH chemiluminescence imaging to track sequentially the combustion process and to analyse the degree of stratification. Initial results show that the combustion with triple injection is more homogenous compared to single and double injection. Furthermore the results show that the 55 octane number fuel can be operated at low load condition with the lowest NVO used, 60 CAD...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{potential}} of using a partial flow filter (PFF) to assist a wall flow diesel particulate filter (DPF) and {{reduce the need for}} active regeneration phases that increase engine fuel consumption. First, the filtration efficiency of the PFF was studied at several engine operating conditions, varying the filter space velocity (SV), through modification of the exhaust gas flow rate, and engine-out particulate matter (PM) concentration. The effects of these parameters were studied for the filtration of different particle size ranges (10 – 30 nm, 30 – 200 nm and 200 – 400 nm). For the various engine operating conditions, the PFF showed filtration efficiency over 25 % in terms of PM number and mass. The PFF filtration behaviour was also investigated at <b>idle</b> <b>engine</b> operation producing a high concentration of nuclei particulates for which the filter was able to maintain 60 % filtration efficiency. After a 14 hour soot loading phase, the filter trapping efficiency remained over 20 % and showed unexpectedly high small PM filtration efficiency. Finally, a system composed of a PFF placed upstream of a DPF was studied and the filtration efficiency, soot mass accumulated, as well as the pressure increase during a loading period of 7 hours were compared to the ones from a standalone DPF, in order to estimate the beneficial effects of using a PFF to assist the main DPF and reduce the regeneration duration and/or frequency...|$|E

50|$|There are {{a variety}} of reasons that bus drivers <b>idle</b> their <b>engines.</b> The {{majority}} of <b>engine</b> <b>idling</b> occurs in the morning, when drivers are warming up the engines and the passenger compartments. Part of the problem with excessive idling, other than the immense amount of fuel it uses, is driver mentality coming from lack of knowledge about the fuel consumption of an <b>idling</b> <b>engine.</b> Typically, a bus driver will turn on the bus when they wake up, then proceed {{to get ready for the}} day, creating a period of excessive idling of up to half an hour. The objective of fuel-operated heaters is to eliminate this specific need for idling, which in turn reduces fuel consumption and costs. This technology works by using the coolant system to warm the engine, and the “thermal energy gained is then distributed through the vehicle's own heat exchanger as forced hot air. This process heats the interior of the vehicle via existing air vents. The engine is also warmed up with the residual heat in the cooling water”. In general, coolant heaters burns eight times less fuel that an <b>idling</b> <b>engine</b> would, simultaneously emitting 1/20th of the emissions and directing heat significantly faster to the passenger compartment. Coolant heaters are also much more efficient than an engine. For example, according to the manufacturer, the Webasto TSL-17 is upwards of 82% efficient, whereas a diesel engine has no more than half that efficiency.|$|R

500|$|When not driving, {{truck drivers}} need to <b>idle</b> their <b>engines</b> to {{maintain}} climate control within the truck cab (interior), {{as well as}} provide electricity for appliances. <b>Engine</b> <b>idling</b> is inefficient and only adds to the problem of air pollution. This unnecessary idling can be remedied with shore power (which is a term and idea borrowed from the shipping industry), or Truck Stop Electrification. When ships are docked in a port, they connect to a land-based power supply to provide electricity and eliminate the need to <b>idle</b> their <b>engines.</b> The idea of shore power was transferred to the trucking industry, and now there are companies such as IdleAire and Shorepower which provide electricity to diesel trucks, which eliminates the need for the driver to <b>idle</b> the <b>engine.</b> IdleAire also provides access to the Internet, cable television, and land line phone services. IdleAire promises to eliminate one-eighth of nitrogen oxide pollution through [...] "electrified parking", however, particulate pollution may increase in those areas where the electricity is provided by coal burning power plants.

5000|$|Idle speed (idling, or idle) is the {{rotational}} speed {{the engine runs}} on when the engine is uncoupled to the drivetrain and the throttle pedal isn't depressed (generally measured in revolutions per minute, or rpm, of the crankshaft of a combustion <b>engine).</b> The <b>idle</b> differs in two ways <b>engine</b> <b>idle</b> and vehicle idle.

For a passenger-car <b>engine,</b> <b>idle</b> speed is customarily between 600 rpm and 1,000 rpm. For buses and trucks it is approximately 540 rpm.

40|$|In {{response}} to a United States Department of Energy (DOE) solicitation, the Maryland Energy Administration (MEA), in partnership with CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSXT), submitted a proposal to DOE to support the demonstration of Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) technology on fifty-six CSXT locomotives. The project purpose was to demonstrate the idle fuel savings, the Nitrous Oxide (NOX) emissions reduction and the noise reduction capabilities of the APU. Fifty-six CSXT Baltimore Division locomotives were equipped with APUs, Engine Run Managers (ERM) and communications equipment to permit GPS tracking and data collection from the locomotives. Throughout the report there is mention of the percent {{time spent in the}} State of Maryland. The fifty-six locomotives spent most of their time inside the borders of Maryland and some spent all their time inside the state borders. Usually when a locomotive traveled beyond the Maryland State border it was into an adjoining state. They were divided into four groups according to assignment: (1) Power Unit/Switcher Mate units, (2) Remote Control units, (3) SD 50 Pusher units and (4) Other units. The primary data of interest were idle data plus the status of the locomotive [...] stationary or moving. Also collected were main <b>engine</b> off, <b>idling</b> or working. Idle data were collected by county location, by locomotive status (stationary or moving) and type of idle (<b>Idle</b> 1, main <b>engine</b> <b>idling,</b> APU off; <b>Idle</b> 2, main <b>engine</b> off, APU on; <b>Idle</b> 3, main <b>engine</b> off, APU off; <b>Idle</b> 4, main <b>engine</b> <b>idle,</b> APU on). Desirable main <b>engine</b> <b>idle</b> states are main engine off and APU off or main engine off and APU on. Measuring the time the main engine spends in these desirable states versus the total time it could spend in an <b>engine</b> <b>idling</b> state allows the calculation of Percent Idle Management Effectiveness (%IME). IME {{is the result of the}} operation of the APU plus the implementation of CSXT's Warm Weather Shutdown Policy. It is difficult to separate the two. The units demonstrated an IME of 64 % at stationary idle for the test period. The data collected during calendar year 2004 demonstrated that 707, 600 gallons of fuel were saved and 285 tons of NOX were not emitted as a result of idle management in stationary idle, which translates to 12, 636 gallons and 5. 1 tons of NOx per unit respectively. The noise reduction capabilities of the APU demonstrated that at 150 feet from the locomotive the loaded APU with the main engine shut down generated noise that was only marginally above ambient noise level...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} cab comfort truck drivers have to <b>idle</b> their <b>engine</b> to obtain the required power for accessories, such as the air conditioner, heater, television, refrigerator, and lights. This <b>idling</b> of the <b>engine</b> has {{a major impact on}} its fuel consumption and exhaust emission. Idling emissions can be as high as 86. 4 g/h, 16, 500 g/h, 5130 g/h, 4 g/h, and 375 g/h for HC, CO 2, CO, PM, and NOx, respectively. Idling fuel consumption rate can be as high as 1. 85 gal/h. The accessory loading, truck model, fuel-injection system, ambient temperature, idling speed, etc., also affect significantly the emission levels and fuel consumption rate. An increase in accessory loading and ambient temperature increases the emissions and fuel consumption. During idling, electronic fuel-injection systems reduce HC, PM, and CO emission, but increase NOx emissions compared with a mechanical fuel-injection system. An increase of idling speed increases fuel consumption rate. There are many systems available on the market to reduce <b>engine</b> <b>idling</b> and improve air quality and fuel consumption rate, such as an auxiliary power unit (APU), truck stop electrification, thermal storage systems, fuel cells, and direct fire heaters. A direct fire heater reduces fuel consumption by 94 - 96 % and an APU reduces consumption by 60 - 87 %. Furthermore, these technologies increase air quality significantly by reducing idling emissions, which is the reason why they are considered as key alternatives to <b>engine</b> <b>idling.</b> (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
