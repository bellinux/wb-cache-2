5|$|Thunderstorms {{can form}} dense cirrus at their tops. As the {{cumulonimbus}} cloud in a thunderstorm grows vertically, the liquid water droplets freeze {{when the air}} temperature reaches the freezing point. The anvil cloud takes its shape because the temperature inversion at the tropopause prevents the warm, moist air forming the thunderstorm from rising any higher, thus creating the <b>flat</b> <b>top.</b> In the tropics, these thunderstorms occasionally produce copious amounts of cirrus from their anvils. High-altitude winds commonly push this dense mat out into an anvil shape that stretches downwind as much as several kilometers.|$|E
5|$|In France, {{his work}} {{inspired}} many French printers and punchcutters such as Robert Estienne and Claude Garamond from 1530 onwards, {{even though the}} typeface of De Aetna with its original capitals was apparently used in only about twelve books between 1496 and 1499. Historian Beatrice Warde suggested in the 1920s that its influence {{may have been due}} to the high quality of printing shown in the original De Aetna volume, perhaps created as a small pilot project. De Aetna was printed using a mixture of alternate characters, perhaps as an experiment, which included a lower-case p in the same style as the capital letter with a <b>flat</b> <b>top.</b> In 1499, Griffo recut the capitals, changing the appearance of the typeface slightly. This version was used to print Manutius' famous illustrated volume Hypnerotomachia Poliphili.|$|E
5|$|The {{vertebral}} column consisted of ten cervical (neck), twelve dorsal, six fused sacral and {{an unknown number}} of caudal (tail) vertebrae. The neck was nearly straight, rather than having the S-curve seen in other theropods, and also unusually wide, especially towards its base. The top of the neck's spinal column featured a double row of enlarged, upwardly directed bony processes called epipophyses, creating a smooth trough {{on the top of the}} neck vertebrae. These processes were the highest points of the spine, towering above the unusually low spinous processes. The epipophyses probably provided attachment areas for a markedly strong neck musculature. A similar double row was also present in the tail, formed there by highly modified caudal ribs, in front view protruding upwards in a V-shape, their inner sides creating a smooth, <b>flat,</b> <b>top</b> surface of the front tail vertebrae. The end of each caudal rib was furnished with a forward projecting hook-shaped expansion that connected to the caudal rib of the preceding vertebra.|$|E

25|$|A raft is a {{structure}} with a <b>flat</b> <b>top</b> that floats. It {{is the most}} basic boat design, characterised {{by the absence of}} a hull.

25|$|A speed table (or <b>flat</b> <b>top</b> hump or raised {{pedestrian}} crossing) {{is designed}} as a long speed hump with a flat section in the middle. Speed tables are generally {{long enough for the}} entire wheelbase of a passenger car to rest on top. The long, flat design allows cars to pass without slowing as significantly as with speed humps or cushions. Because they slow cars less than similar devices, speed tables are often used on roads with typical residential speed limits.|$|E
25|$|The second-highest {{mountain}} range is the Oquirrhs, reaching a maximum height of 10,620 feet (3,237 m) at <b>Flat</b> <b>Top.</b> The Traverse Mountains {{to the south}} extend to 6,000feet (1,830m), nearly connecting the Wasatch and Oquirrh Mountains.

25|$|Located in the Tijuca Range, Pedra da Gávea is 842m (2,762ft) tall, and is {{a granite}} dome. The <b>flat</b> <b>top</b> of the {{mountain}} is capped with a 150m tall layer of granite, whereas underneath, the mound {{is made up of}} gneiss. The former dates to around 450 million years ago, whereas the latter dates to 600 million years. The mountain, much like other stone outcroppings in and around the area, is the result of younger Neoproterozoic granitoid rocks and thin Cretaceous diabase dikes intruding the older Meso-Neoproterozoic high-grade metasedimentary rocks.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to size classification, icebergs {{can be classified}} {{on the basis of}} their shape. The two basic types of iceberg forms are tabular and non-tabular. Tabular icebergs have steep sides and a <b>flat</b> <b>top,</b> much like a plateau, with a length-to-height ratio of more than 5:1. This type of iceberg, also known as an ice island, can be quite large, as in the case of Pobeda Ice Island. Antarctic icebergs formed by breaking off from an ice shelf, such as the Ross Ice Shelf or Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf, are typically tabular. The largest icebergs in the world are formed this way.|$|E
25|$|Indian Mesa is a <b>flat</b> <b>top</b> hill whose {{sides are}} steep cliffs.

On top of the mesa there are ruins of a prehistoric Hohokam village which is monitored by the Arizona Site Stewards and considered an important archaeological site by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. There is a small, steep and narrow path which begins at the skirt {{of the hill and}} leads {{to the top of the}} mesa.|$|E
25|$|Built in {{receding}} tiers upon a rectangular, oval, or square platform, the ziggurat was a pyramidal {{structure with}} a <b>flat</b> <b>top.</b> Sun-baked bricks {{made up the}} core of the ziggurat with facings of fired bricks on the outside. The facings were often glazed in different colors and may have had astrological significance. Kings sometimes had their names engraved on these glazed bricks. The number of tiers ranged from two to seven. It is assumed that they had shrines at the top, but there is no archaeological evidence for this and the only textual evidence is from Herodotus. Access to the shrine would have been by a series of ramps {{on one side of the}} ziggurat or by a spiral ramp from base to summit.|$|E
