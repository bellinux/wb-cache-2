The Petrobras scandal hurt the economy by causing a slowdown in investment in energy and construction.|$|R
50|$|The lawsuit {{allegations}} claim Gabelli, {{by virtue}} of his role in publicly traded LICT Corp., was fraudulent because Gabelli had de facto control over the companies and had aggregate assets that far <b>exceeded</b> the <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> the small business criteria, which would disqualify an applicant from the small business discount auctions. Supposedly, many other participants, both individuals as well as corporations, in the wireless auctions, totally unrelated to Gabelli, also set up business arrangements {{to take advantage of the}} small business discount and succeeded, even though in reality they too could not pass the small business criteria. The government stood on the sideline and did not take up the suit for the American public.|$|R
50|$|The maximum {{unemployment}} benefit is (as of July 2016) SEK 980 per day. During the first 200 days the unemployed will receive 80 {{percent of his}} or her normal income during the last 12 months. From day 201-300 this goes down to 70 percent and from day 301-450 the insurance covers 65 percent of the normal income (only available for parents to {{children under the age of}} 18). In Sweden tax is paid on {{unemployment benefit}}s, so the unemployed will get a maximum of about SEK 10,000 per month during the first 100 days (depending on the municipality tax rate). In other currencies, as of June 2017, this means a maximum of approximately £900, $1,150, or €1,000, each month after tax. Private insurance is also available, mainly through professional organisations, to provide income related compensation that otherwise <b>exceeds</b> the <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> the scheme. The comprehensive scheme is funded by tax.|$|R

The villagers themselves are not permitted to truck in heavy supplies like flour, fodder and gas cylinders but are required by the Israeli military to carry them on foot through the checkpoint to their homes 1.5 kilometers away. The former UN Special Rapporteur Richard Falk has endorsed this description, calling the constrictive policies applied to the village an example of [...] "indirect forcible transfer."According to B'Tselem, behind the restrictions on Nuaman lie a government policy which aims to maintain the demographic balance of Jerusalem by encouraging refusing to allow Palestinians to <b>exceed</b> the <b>ceiling</b> <b>of</b> 30% of the city's population, with measures that include forced expulsions. Israeli officials deny there is any wish to expel the villagers. Lt. Col. Shlomo Dror that Nuaman's difficulties will eventually be smoothed out.

In buildings that suffered severe structural damage, ceilings and other non-structural components (rather expectedly) failed, but even in buildings with little damage to their structural systems, ceilings {{were found to be}} severely damaged. The extent <b>of</b> <b>ceiling</b> damage, where the ceilings were subject to severe shaking, depended on the type <b>of</b> the <b>ceiling</b> system, the size and weight <b>of</b> the <b>ceilings</b> and the interaction <b>of</b> <b>ceilings</b> with other elements.

In some buildings, collapse <b>of</b> <b>ceilings</b> could easily have resulted in severe injury to occupants. This paper summarizes the types <b>of</b> <b>ceiling</b> damage observed in the Canterbury earthquakes, and draws useful lessons from the observed performance of different types <b>of</b> <b>ceiling</b> systems. Existing ceiling manufacturing and installing practices/regulations in New Zealand are critically scrutinized to identify deficiencies, and measures are suggested to improve the practice so that the damage to ceilings and the resulting loss are minimized in future earthquakes...|$|R

Provided the ceiling fan is properly sized for the room {{in which it is}} operating, its efficiency of moving air far <b>exceeds</b> that <b>of</b> an air conditioning unit, therefore, for peak efficiency, the air conditioner should be set to a low fan setting and the ceiling fan should be used to circulate the air.|$|R

5000|$|An older, {{less common}} type <b>of</b> dropped <b>ceiling</b> is the {{concealed}} grid system. This type <b>of</b> dropped <b>ceiling</b> employs {{a method of}} interlocking panels into {{each other and the}} grid with the use of small strips of metal called 'splines', thus making it difficult to remove panels to gain access above the ceiling without damaging the installation or the panels. Normally, these type <b>of</b> <b>ceilings</b> will have a [...] "key panel" [...] (usually in the corner) which can be removed, allowing for the other panels to be slid out of the grid (a series of metal channels called 'z bars') one by one, until eventually removing the desired panel. This type <b>of</b> <b>ceiling</b> is more commonly found in older installations or installations where access to above the ceiling is generally considered unnecessary.|$|R
