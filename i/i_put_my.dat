5|$|I am {{excited to}} give my Australian fans the World Premiere of 'Love On Top'! Thank you for the amazing {{response}} to the song at radio. I have worked very hard on this video, this song is special to me and I had an idea for the video based on {{some of my favorite}} male groups. I remember seeing videos from New Edition, The Jackson 5 and the Temptations, bands I love for their beautiful harmonies, and precise choreography and I always wanted to make a video and be part of a boy group myself. It was so much fun. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> heart and soul into 'Love On Top' and I hope you love it.|$|E
5|$|We made it {{very clear}} we were not doing another record for TVT. But they made it pretty clear they weren't ready to sell. So I felt like, well, I've finally got this thing going but it's dead. Flood and I had to record Broken under a {{different}} band name, because if TVT found out we were recording, they could confiscate all our shit and release it. Jimmy Iovine got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn't my doing. I didn't know anything about Interscope. And I was real pissed off at him at first because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one. But Interscope went into it like they really wanted to know what I wanted. It was good, after <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> raving lunatic act on.|$|E
25|$|After {{this she}} was {{thrashing}} {{around on the}} ground. She was trying to scream but nothing was coming out. I think I kicked her because she wouldn't keep still. And then <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> foot on to her to keep her still. This didn't work so I stabbed her in the throat. I aimed and stabbed at the hard thing in her neck. I pushed the knife {{all the way in}} but she still wouldn't keep still so I worked out where her heart would be and I stabbed her {{on the left side of}} the chest.|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] said <b>I,</b> <b>putting</b> <b>my</b> {{fingers into}} my {{waistcoat}} pocket; [...] "but {{here is a}} sixpence for you, which you may keep, and never mind the change, if you'll walk along the streets with me a bit." ...|$|R
500|$|Jackson had {{previously}} expressed [...] interest {{in becoming a}} basketball administrator following retirement, saying that [...] "Where <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> time and energy is now crucial. [...] I {{want to get involved}} in the political side of sport rather than the media and I need to learn from the people who have been there before." [...] She now heads the women's division of Australian Basketball Alliance, [...] a new trade union for basketballers formed in 2015. A main pursuit of hers is getting tertiary education for all players. In May 2016, Jackson joined the new ownership group of the Melbourne Boomers, being named the team's commercial operations executive. Jackson also served as a colour commentator for Channel Seven's broadcast of the Olympic tournament.|$|E
500|$|Several {{artists have}} remixed or made a {{freestyle}} over the beat, including Eminem, B.o.B, Sean Kingston, Royce da 5'9", Trey Songz, Fat Joe, Teairra Marí, and Diggy Simmons. Simmons, {{the first to}} release a freestyle over the track told Vibe, “With that freestyle, I heard the track, loved it, then got the instrumental from {{a friend of mine}} and just did it on the whim. It wasn’t really anything I planned. I wasn’t even ready for this to be a big thing because I’ve had tracks out before. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> all into everything, but sometimes some tracks come out better than others. It got such a big buzz maybe because it came out the day after and people enjoyed it.” ...|$|E
500|$|The parade scene took {{multiple}} days of filming; Broderick {{spent some}} time practicing the dance moves. [...] "I was very scared", Broderick said. [...] "Fortunately, the sequence was carefully choreographed beforehand. We worked out all the moves by rehearsing in a little studio. It was shot on two Saturdays {{in the heart of}} downtown Chicago. The first day was during a real parade, and John got some very long shots. Then radio stations carried announcements inviting people to take part in 'a John Hughes movie'. The word got around fast and 10,000 people showed up! For the final shot, I turned around and saw a river of people. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> hands {{up at the end of}} the number and heard this huge roar. I can understand how rock stars feel. That kind of reaction feeds you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{broke the}} Law," [...] said <b>I,</b> <b>putting</b> <b>my</b> {{foot on the}} Sayer of the Law. [...] "They have been slain,--even the Sayer of the Law; even the Other with the Whip. Great is the Law! Come and see." ...|$|R

500|$|On October 24, {{the band}} {{mentioned}} {{that they had}} nearly finishing recording the album and would start the mixing process shortly afterwards. On November 6, the band announced they were [...] "still putting the finshing [...] touches on the album". The recordings were mixed by Tom Lord-Alge with Fernio Hernandez at South Beach Studios in Miami, Florida. Ted Jensen mastered the recordings at Sterling Sound in New York City. In retrospect, Lazzara called Kahne [...] "a good producer," [...] but didn't think he was [...] "the right fit" [...] for the group. He added that what the group aimed to accomplish was [...] "just different than what he had envisioned both sonically and {{with all of that}} stuff". Reyes said he was [...] "pre-warned about working with him and I didn't listen to that. ... It was kind of very blank. I think <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> guitar tracks on and then I flew back home and that was it." ...|$|E
500|$|Richard Marshall (Ian Ogilvy) {{is a young}} Roundhead. After {{surviving}} a brief skirmish {{and killing}} his first enemy soldier (and thus saving the life of his Captain), he rides home to Brandeston, Suffolk, to visit his lover Sara (Hilary Dwyer). Sara is the niece of the village priest, John Lowes (Rupert Davies). Lowes gives his permission to Marshall to marry Sara, telling him there is trouble coming to the village and he wants Sara far away before it arrives. Marshall asks Sara why the old man is frightened. She tells him they have been threatened and become outcasts in their own village. Marshall vows to Sara, [...] "rest easy and no-one shall harm you. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> oath to that." [...] At {{the end of his}} army leave, Marshall rides back to join his regiment, and chances upon Hopkins and Stearne on the path. Marshall gives the two men directions to Brandeston then rides on.|$|E
500|$|When {{he signed}} a {{professional}} football contract with the New York Giants, Timberlake stated {{that he intended to}} take ministerial training at Princeton Theological Seminary during the off-season. [...] He noted, [...] "I don't really want to play professional football, because there is no privacy and no time to be alone when you're a famous athlete." [...] He emphasized that, if he were ever forced to choose between professional football or studying for the ministry, he would give up football: [...] "I see no reason why I can't do both, but if I have to give up pro ball, I'll certainly do it." [...] Timberlake said the thing he would always remember about playing football was the 20 minutes before kickoff. [...] He recalled that those 20 minutes were [...] "horrible." [...] "You want to go home. [...] You want to quit football. [...] It is times like these when something happens to me. [...] I can't explain it. [...] <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> face in my hands and ask God to come into my heart and give me courage. He gives me peace." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do not ask me," [...] cried <b>I,</b> <b>putting</b> <b>my</b> {{hands before}} my eyes, for I thought I saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room; [...] "HE can tell. Oh, save me!

500|$|In interviews, Hendrix usually gave {{different}} {{answers about}} the development of the song's lyrics. [...] Biographer Harry Shapiro points out that [...] "Purple Haze" [...] is most likely [...] "a pot-pourri of ideas" [...] which Hendrix developed over time. [...] As a fan of science fiction, he frequently incorporated its imagery in his songwriting. [...] Hendrix read Night of Light, a 1966 novel by Philip Jose Farmer, that expanded on a short story published in 1957. [...] In the story set on a distant planet, sunspots produce a [...] "purplish haze" [...] which has a disorienting effect on the inhabitants. [...] An early handwritten draft by Hendrix, titled [...] "Purple Haze – Jesus Saves", uses dream-like imagery where the sense of direction and time is distorted. [...] In an interview on January 28, 1967, before the song was completed, Hendrix was asked how he wrote songs; he responded, [...] "I dream a lot and <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> dreams down as songs. I wrote one called 'First Look Around the Corner' and another called 'The Purple Haze,' which was about a dream I had that I was walking under the sea." [...] He later expressed frustration that he was unable to more fully develop his ideas for the song: ...|$|E
500|$|O'Reilly {{explained}} that Naomi's style was {{harder to get}} right and she worked with the producers, costume and make-up departments {{to find the right}} look. The actress said, [...] "she has {{to have a sense of}} sass and sexuality about her, but she's not cheap and she has worked very hard to shake off her trashy past. What we've come up with is amazing. Some days <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> costume on for a scene and think, 'Oh Naomi, you're outrageous! I could never wear this! Oh well. Go get 'em girl!'" [...] O'Reilly thought some of Naomi's outfits complimented her [...] "quite sexual" [...] nature, especially the six-inch heels and small tops. O'Reilly admitted that she did not have too much in common with Naomi, but they could both be [...] "goofy and funny". She thought Naomi was definitely not as level-headed as she was in real life. She also said that she enjoyed playing a character who was different from herself. Executive producer Jason Herbison told Sarah Ellis from Inside Soap that he thought Naomi's type of character – a [...] "classic, troublemaking vixen, who underneath it all is just deeply insecure" [...] – had been missing from Neighbours for a few years.|$|E
500|$|Some of the album's {{songs were}} {{recorded}} by Saadiq with his live band, which included drummer Lemar Carter, bassist Calvin Turner, and guitarist Rob Bacon. Bacon, {{who had played}} with Saadiq since 2002, said of their grittier approach to guitar, [...] "I have relative pitch, as opposed to perfect pitch, so there'd be times when I'd spend 15 or 20 minutes tuning my instrument. Then he'd come in and pick up his guitar and just start playing it however it was left the day before. On one of the tracks I had to play over all this stuff {{that was out of}} tune. Raphael was like, 'That's what makes it funky!'". Musical guests such as vocalist Yukimi Nagano, keyboardist Larry Dunn, bass player Larry Graham, keyboardist Amp Fiddler, and pedal steel guitarist Robert Randolph also contributed to the album's recording sessions, with Saadiq selecting their parts for certain tracks. The song [...] "Go to Hell" [...] was conceived from one of Amp Fiddler's Mellotron ideas. Saadiq recorded a duet with Graham called [...] "The Perfect Storm", included as a hidden track on the album: [...] "I played bass, but <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> bass down [...] The first day I tried to play bass for him, I couldn't even play. I froze three times. He's my all-time idol!".|$|E

500|$|Like Ice-T's {{gangsta rap}} albums, Body Counts {{material}} focused on various {{social and political}} issues, with songs focusing on topics ranging from police brutality to drug abuse. According to Ernie C, [...] "Everybody writes about whatever they learned growing up, and we were no exception. Like The Beach Boys sing about the beach, we sing {{about the way we}} grew up." [...] Ice-T states that [...] "Body Count was an angry record. It {{was meant to be a}} protest record. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> anger in it, while lacing it with dark humor." [...] The spoken introduction, [...] "Smoked Pork" [...] features Ice-T taking on the roles of a gangster pretending to be seemingly stranded motorist and a police officer who refuses to aid. The track begins with Mooseman and Ice-T driving their car towards a police car, and then Ice-T asks for the gun Mooseman has and tells Mooseman to stay in the car, much to Mooseman's chagrin, as Mooseman wanted to kill the cop in this round. Ice-T then walks up to the policeman, pretending to be a stranded motorist, asking for help, but the policeman refuses, saying: [...] "Nah, that's not my job! My job's not to help your fuckin' ass out!", then telling him that [...] "my job is eatin' these doughnuts". When the officer recognizes Ice-T, gunshots are heard. The final voice on the track is Ice-T confirming his identity.|$|E

2500|$|Long {{before the}} NTSB issued its final report, Western media began to {{speculate}} {{about the meaning of}} the recorded cockpit conversations and about possible motives – including suicide and terrorism – behind Al-Batouti's actions on the flight.

Upon breaking it open, Fox noted its lack of contents and remarked, [...] "Empty. Totally Empty. He doesn't have any brains." [...] Discussing the event during a subsequent interview with GQ, Fox expanded, [...] "I had such a joy in my heart by doing that, because in Mexico, piñatas are very meaningful. Piñatas are a celebration. Piñatas let you send messages. And the message is: Trump is empty inside. He's empty in his head. That's why <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> hand into his head.
