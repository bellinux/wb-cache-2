40|$|The {{kinetics}} of hydrolysis of trimethylamine- and of triethylaminesulphur trioxide addition compounds {{have been}} studied in water and in aqueous acetone. Reaction occurs according to the equation, formula presented. The solvolysis reactions are first-order and are not catalyzed by acids. The halide ions, Cl’, Br’, and I’, show only a normal salt effect on the rate of hydrolysis of formula presented but {{in the presence of}} fluoride ions, the rate constant for the production of acid from formula presented in water at 95 °C is about one-seventh of that in the absence of fluoride under the same conditions. It is suggested that the <b>fluorosulphonate</b> ion is formed rapidly, and that this ion then undergoes slow hydrolysis: Formula presented. In the presence of alkali, using water as the solvent, second-order kinetics are observed, the equation for the reaction being, formula presented. Assuming the reaction with water is bimolecular, the ratio of the (bimolecular) rate constants at 35 °C, kOH/kHO is approximately 10 for each complex. In aqueous acetone, at low water concentrations, the hydrolysis reactions of the trialkylaminesulphur trioxide complexes show second-order kinetics. At 35 °C for the hydrolysis of formula presented the ratio of the second-order rate constant in aqueous acetone to the (calculated) second-order rate constant in water is approximately 550; formula presented the same ratio is 6900. It is considered that hydrolysis occurs in water and in aqueous acetone via a bi- molecular attack at sulphur...|$|E
