5|$|Immediately {{after the}} sinkhole's collapse, there were plans {{to fill it}} in with a soil cement made from cement, limestone, and water known locally as lodocreto ("mudcrete"). This {{substance}} was also used {{to fill in the}} 2007 Guatemala City sinkhole. However, another technique, which geologists call the graded-filter technique, in which the sinkhole is filled with successive layers of boulders, smaller rocks, and gravel, could possibly be a better solution. This is because filling the hole in with cement <b>diverts</b> water runoff to other areas, potentially increasing the risk of sinkholes occurring {{in other parts of the}} city. The graded-filter technique, on the other hand, allows water to seep through.|$|E

5|$|The {{interaction}} of the Jovian magnetosphere with Ganymede, which has an intrinsic magnetic moment, differs from its interaction with the non-magnetized moons. Ganymede's internal magnetic field carves a cavity inside Jupiter's magnetosphere with a diameter of approximately two Ganymede diameters, creating a mini-magnetosphere within Jupiter's magnetosphere. Ganymede's magnetic field <b>diverts</b> the co-rotating plasma flow around its magnetosphere. It also protects the moon's equatorial regions, where the field lines are closed, from energetic particles. The latter can still freely strike Ganymede's poles, where the field lines are open. Some of the energetic particles are trapped near the equator of Ganymede, creating mini-radiation belts.

5|$|During El Niño events, {{increased}} precipitation {{is expected}} in California due to a more southerly, zonal, storm track. During the Niño portion of ENSO, increased precipitation falls along the Gulf coast and Southeast due to a stronger than normal, and more southerly, polar jet stream. Snowfall is greater than average across the southern Rockies and Sierra Nevada mountain range, and is well below normal across the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes states. The northern tier of the lower 48 exhibits above normal temperatures during the fall and winter, while the Gulf coast experiences below normal temperatures during the winter season. The subtropical jet stream across the deep tropics of the Northern Hemisphere is enhanced due to increased convection in the equatorial Pacific, which decreases tropical cyclogenesis within the Atlantic tropics below what is normal, and increases tropical cyclone activity across the eastern Pacific. In the Southern Hemisphere, the subtropical jet stream is displaced equatorward, or north, of its normal position, which <b>diverts</b> frontal systems and thunderstorm complexes from reaching central portions of the continent.|$|E
5|$|Hydrocephalus is an {{abnormal}} accumulation of CSF in the ventricles of the brain. Hydrocephalus can occur because {{of obstruction of}} the passage of CSF, such as from an infection, injury, mass, or congenital abnormality. Hydrocephalus without obstruction associated with normal CSF pressure may also occur. Symptoms can include problems with gait and coordination, urinary incontinence, nausea and vomiting, and progressively impaired thinking. In infants, hydrocephalus can cause an enlarged head, as {{the bones of the}} skull have not yet fused, seizures, irritability and drowsiness. A CT scan or MRI scan may reveal enlargement of one or both lateral ventricles, or causative masses or lesions, and lumbar puncture may be used to demonstrate and in some circumstances relieve high intracranial pressure.

40|$|Purpose: A <b>diverting</b> stoma {{is known}} to reduce the {{consequences}} of distal anastomotic failure following colorectal sur-gery. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the efficacy of a <b>diverting</b> stoma after an ultra-low anterior resection (uLAR) for rectal cancer. Methods: Between 2000 and 2007, 836 patients who underwent an uLAR were divided into two groups, depending on the fecal diversion: 246 received fecal diversion, and 590 had no diversion. Patient- and disease-related variables were com-pared between the two groups. Results: Thirty-two of the 836 patients (3. 8 %) had immediate anastomosis-related complications and required reopera-tion. Anastomosis leakage comprised 72 % of the complications (23 / 32). The overall immediate complication rate was sig-nificantly lower in patients with a <b>diverting</b> stoma (0. 8 %, 2 / 246) compared to those without a <b>diverting</b> stoma (5. 1 %, 30 / 590; P = 0. 005). The fecal diversion group had lower tumor location, lower anastomosis level, and more preoperative chemo-radiation therapy (P < 0. 001). In total, 12 % of patients in the <b>diverting</b> stoma group had complications either in making or reversing the stoma (30 / 246). Conclusion: The <b>diverting</b> stoma decreased the rate of immediate anastomosis-related complications. However, the rate of complications associated with the <b>diverting</b> stoma was non-negligible, so strict criteria should be applied when deciding whether to use a <b>diverting</b> stoma...|$|R

5|$|Trinity River Division is {{the second}} large CVP {{department}} for the northern Sacramento Valley. The {{primary purpose of the}} division is to divert water from the Trinity River into the Sacramento River drainage downstream of Shasta Dam in order to provide more flow in the Sacramento River and generating peaking power in the process. Trinity Dam forms Trinity Lake, the second largest CVP water-storage reservoir, with just over half the capacity of Shasta and a generating capacity of 140 MW. Lewiston Dam, downstream of Trinity Dam, <b>diverts</b> water into the Clear Creek Tunnel, which travels to empty into a third reservoir, Whiskeytown Lake on Clear Creek, a tributary of the Sacramento River, generating 154 MW of power in the process. Whiskeytown Lake (formed by Clair.

From there the water from the Trinity River empties into Keswick Reservoir and the Sacramento River. In 1963, the Spring Creek Debris Dam was constructed just upstream of the outlet of the Spring Creek Tunnel, to prevent acid mine drainage from the Iron Mountain Mine from continuing downstream and contaminating the river.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} {{the use of}} diversion mechanism in matrix acidizing to increase the flow resistance in highly permeable regions due {{to the presence of}} polymer temporary plugs. In this study, three polymers, namely hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), hydroxypropyl guar (HPG), and xanthan gum were evaluated in the laboratory to determine the best <b>diverting</b> agent to enhance the performance of matrix acidizing. An acidizing system was set-up using coreflooding techniques where Berea sandstone cores saturated with Sarapar were damaged by oil-based mud. Treatment fluids used were mud acid (3 % HF – 12 % HCl), HCl, polymer gels, and ethylene glycol monobutyl ether (EGMBE) as the mutual solvent. Polymer solutions were prepared at 40 lb/Mgal (4793 ppm) as per field formulation. The experimental results revealed that at low injection pressure, mud acid without <b>diverting</b> agents furnished the best performance where the improvement ratio achieved was 4. 88 at 50 psi (344. 7 kPa), compared with improvement ratio of 2. 42 for HEC, 2. 66 for HPG, and 1. 35 for xanthan gum. However, at higher injection pressure, mud acid with <b>diverting</b> agents gave better results, where at injection pressure of 100 psi (689. 5 kPa), mud acid with HEC <b>diverting</b> agent produced the best result with improvement ratio of 4. 88 compared to 1. 80 for mud acid without <b>diverting</b> agents. Generally, at low injection pressure, mud acid is found to stay longer in the core and has sufficient time to dissolve mud particles. Nevertheless, low injection pressure produces insufficient force to push acid deeper into the formation and fails to dissolve the viscous <b>diverting</b> agents completely. At high injection pressure, there is sufficient force for the acid to dissolve mud particles and viscous <b>diverting</b> agents, hence the <b>diverting</b> agents served its purpose by <b>diverting</b> the mud acid into low permeability zone...|$|R
