5|$|Mulder and Scully {{discover}} {{remains of}} normal human babies in Betsy's yard where Weinsider was digging. When seeing the evidence, Mulder deduces that Betsy is another demon who {{is unable to}} have a baby demon unless another demon impregnates her. Unlike Weinsider, she has been terminating pregnancies that resulted in non-demonic fetuses: the very type Weinsider has been so desperate to father. As a demon, she could recognize her husband as a demon in her dream and stop him extracting her baby. However, it becomes apparent that she never lost her baby; it was merely a trick to frame her demon husband. At the end of the narrative, Betsy Monroe drives away with her new demon baby. Her eyes flash with a red <b>gleam</b> before returning to normal.|$|E

25|$|A term may be {{omitted from}} a {{well-known}} kenning: val-teigs Hildr “hawk-ground’s valkyrie/goddess” (Haraldr Harðráði: Lausavísa 19). The full expression implied here is “goddess of gleam/fire/adornment of ground/land/seat/perch of hawk” = “goddess of <b>gleam</b> of arm” = “goddess of gold” = “lady” (characterised according to convention as wearing golden jewellery, the arm-kenning being a reference to falconry).

25|$|Sometimes {{there is}} a kind of {{redundancy}} whereby the referent of the whole kenning, or a kenning for it, is embedded: barmi dólg-svölu “brother of hostility-swallow” = “brother of raven” = “raven” (Oddr breiðfirðingr: Illugadrápa 1); blik-meiðendr bauga láðs “gleam-harmers of the land of rings” = “harmers of <b>gleam</b> of arm” = “harmers of ring” = “leaders, nobles, men of social standing (conceived of as generously destroying gold, i.e. giving it away freely)” (Anon.: Líknarbraut 42).|$|E

25|$|There are {{legends of}} him (Khidr) in which, like Osiris, he is dismembered and reborn; and prophecies {{connecting}} him, like the Green Man, {{with the end}} of time. His name means the Green One or Verdant One, he is the voice of inspiration to the aspirant and committed artist. He can come as a white light or the <b>gleam</b> on a blade of grass, but more often as an inner mood. The sign of his presence is the ability to work or experience with tireless enthusiasm beyond one's normal capacities. In this there may be a link across cultures, …one reason for the enthusiasm of the medieval sculptors for the Green Man may be that he was the source of every inspiration.|$|E

25|$|Near that temple is a {{very large}} tree with {{widespread}} branches which are always green both in winter and summer. What kind of tree it is nobody knows. There is also a spring there where the pagan are accustomed to perform sacrifices and to immerse a human being alive. As long as his body is not found, the request of the people will be fulfilled. A golden chain encircles that temple and hangs over the gables of the building. Those who approach see its <b>gleam</b> from afar off because the shrine, which is located on a plain, is encircled by mountains so situated as to give the effect of a theatre. For nine days feasts and sacrifices of this kind are celebrated. Every day they sacrifice one human being in addition to other animals, so that in nine days there are 72 victims which are sacrificed. This sacrifice takes place about the time of the vernal equinox.|$|E
500|$|He was {{a member}} of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce from October 1888. [...] His first two books {{promoted}} California. In California of the South (1888), described by David Fine as [...] "one of the earliest booster tracts" [...] Widney and Walter Lindley wrote: [...] "The health-seeker who, after suffering in both mind and body, after vainly trying the cold climate of Minnesota and the warm climate of Florida, after visiting Mentone, Cannes, and Nice, after traveling to Cuba and Algiers, and noticing that he is losing ounce upon ounce of flesh, and his cheeks have grown more sunken, his appetite more capricious, his breath more hurried, that his temperature is no longer normal,... turns with a <b>gleam</b> of hope toward the Occident"—by which they meant Southern California. Many people followed that <b>gleam</b> and found it something more than hope".|$|E

500|$|Pomp, {{ritual and}} luxury were discarded. These caused Pedro II {{to be viewed}} as [...] "a great citizen" [...] in the popular imagination, {{but at the same time}} his image as a monarch, as a living symbol and {{authority}} figure diminished. As a German journalist remarked in 1883: [...] "It is a rare thing, in the Emperor's situation: he has no personal fortune and his civil list, already by itself insufficient, is almost all expended on charity, in a way that he cannot afford any pomp in the court, nor do anything to give any <b>gleam</b> to his residences [...] It undoubtedly does great honor to the man, but contributes little to the necessary prestige of the Emperor." [...] But the society in which the Emperor lived put great store in ceremonials and customs, and the Emperor had discarded much of the symbolism and aura with which the Imperial system was imbued.|$|E
500|$|When {{the torch}} was {{illuminated}} {{on the evening}} of the statue's dedication, it produced only a faint <b>gleam,</b> barely visible from Manhattan. The World characterized it as [...] "more like a glowworm than a beacon." [...] Bartholdi suggested gilding the statue to increase its ability to reflect light, but this proved too expensive. The United States Lighthouse Board took over the Statue of Liberty in 1887 and pledged to install equipment to enhance the torch's effect; in spite of its efforts, the statue remained virtually invisible at night. When Bartholdi returned to the United States in 1893, he made additional suggestions, all of which proved ineffective. He did successfully lobby for improved lighting within the statue, allowing visitors to better appreciate Eiffel's design. In 1901, President Theodore Roosevelt, once a member of the New York committee, ordered the statue's transfer to the War Department, as it had proved useless as a lighthouse. A unit of the Army Signal Corps was stationed on Bedloe's Island until 1923, after which military police remained there while the island was under military jurisdiction.|$|E

500|$|Burroughs {{continued}} to publicly disagree with Long and his allies, {{and a number}} of his essays dedicated to [...] "sham nature history" [...] were collected in the volume Ways of Nature, published in late 1905. Admitting that his authorial tone had changed since 1903, he wrote in the preface that [...] "My readers will find this volume quite a departure in certain ways from the tone and spirit of my previous books, especially in regard to the subject of animal intelligence. Heretofore I have made the most of every <b>gleam</b> of intelligence of bird or four-footed beast that came under my observation, often, I fancy, making too much of it, and giving the wild creatures credit for more 'sense' than they really possessed." [...] Mabel Osgood Wright weighed in on the debate in a 1905 essay titled [...] "Nature as a Field for Fiction", in which she criticized both sides. Believing that nature writing could imbue animal characters with human qualities in order to better connect with the reader on an emotional level, Wright argued that nature writing should nonetheless strive to be factual and not fantastical.|$|E
500|$|By {{the late}} 1860s the railroads had {{extended}} their rails to Minneapolis/St. Paul {{and they began}} to actively advertise Minnesota as a tourist destination. [...] The 1878 Chicago, Burlington & Quincy railway promotional booklet, A Guide to the Summer Resorts of Minnesota, told of the delights and health benefits of travel to Minnesota: [...] "The scenery is unequaled and the invigorating air is so rich in oxygen and ozone that it is unsurpassed anywhere in the world and is sure to offer to the tourist and the invalid a hearty welcome, confident that the one will surely find rest and enjoyment, and the other that much coveted of earthly blessings — health." [...] The booklet describes the coach ride from Minneapolis to Minnehaha Falls: [...] "One of the famous trips that few tourists miss taking is that from Minneapolis to St. Paul by carriage. [...] Starting from the former place {{on the west side of}} the river, a pleasant drive of four miles over a level prairie, brings the traveler to Where the Falls of Minnehaha Flash and <b>gleam</b> among the oak trees.

500|$|Eidelman {{stated that}} he finds science fiction the most {{interesting}} and exciting genre to compose for, and that Meyer told him to treat the film as a fresh start, rather than drawing on old Star Trek themes. Eidelman wanted the music to aid the visuals; for Rura Penthe, he strove to create an atmosphere that reflected the alien and dangerous setting, introducing exotic instruments for color. Besides using percussion from around the world, Eidelman treated the choir as percussion, with the Klingon language translation for [...] "to be, or not to be" [...] ("taH pagh, taHbe") being repeated in the background. Spock's theme {{was designed to be}} an ethereal counterpart to the motif for Kirk and the Enterprise, aimed at capturing [...] "the emotional <b>gleam</b> in the captain's eye". Kirk's internal dilemma about what the future holds was echoed in the main theme: [...] "It's Kirk taking control one last time and as he looks out into the stars he has the spark again [...] But there's an unresolved note, because it's very important that he doesn't trust the Klingons. He doesn't want to go on this trip even though the spark is there that overtook him." [...] For the climactic battle, Eidelman starts the music quietly, building the intensity as the battle progresses.|$|E
