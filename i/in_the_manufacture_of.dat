5|$|Only about 6% of {{the salt}} {{manufactured}} {{in the world is}} used in food. Of the remainder, 12% is used in water conditioning processes, 8% goes for de-icing highways and 6% is used in agriculture. The rest (68%) is used for manufacturing and other industrial processes, and sodium chloride {{is one of the largest}} inorganic raw materials used by volume. Its major chemical products are caustic soda and chlorine, which are separated by the electrolysis of a pure brine solution. These are used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> PVC, plastics, paper pulp and many other inorganic and organic compounds. Salt is also used as a flux in the production of aluminium. For this purpose, a layer of melted salt floats on top of the molten metal and removes iron and other metal contaminants. It is also used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> soaps and glycerine, where it is added to the vat to precipitate out the saponified products. As an emulsifier, salt is used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> synthetic rubber, and another use is in the firing of pottery, when salt added to the furnace vaporises before condensing onto the surface of the ceramic material, forming a strong glaze.|$|E
5|$|Quantitatively, of all {{elemental}} chlorine produced, about 63% is used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> organic compounds, and 18% <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>manufacture</b> <b>of</b> inorganic chlorine compounds. About 15,000 chlorine compounds are used commercially. The remaining 19% of chlorine produced {{is used for}} bleaches and disinfection products. The most significant of organic compounds in terms of production volume are 1,2-dichloroethane and vinyl chloride, intermediates {{in the production of}} PVC. Other particularly important organochlorines are methyl chloride, methylene chloride, chloroform, vinylidene chloride, trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, allyl chloride, epichlorohydrin, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzenes, and trichlorobenzenes. The major inorganic compounds include HCl, Cl2O, HOCl, NaClO3, chlorinated isocyanurates, AlCl3, SiCl4, SnCl4, PCl3, PCl5, POCl3, AsCl3, SbCl3, SbCl5, BiCl3, S2Cl2, SCl2, SOCI2, ClF3, ICl, ICl3, TiCl3, TiCl4, MoCl5, FeCl3, ZnCl2, and so on.|$|E
