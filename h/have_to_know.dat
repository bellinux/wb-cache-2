Patty, Maxene, and LaVerne were his most frequent collaborators on disc from 1939 to 1952—a partnership that produced four million-selling singles: Pistol Packin' Mama, Jingle Bells, Don't Fence Me In, and South America, Take it Away. They made one film appearance together in Road to Rio singing You Don't <b>Have</b> <b>to</b> <b>Know</b> the Language, and sang together countless times on radio shows throughout the 1940s and 1950s. They appeared as guests on each other's shows quite often, {{as well as on}} many shows for the Armed Forces Radio Service during and after World War II. The quartet's Top-10 Billboard hits from 1943 to 1945 including The Vict'ry Polka, There'll Be a Hot Time in the Town of Berlin (When the Yanks Go Marching In), and Is You Is or Is You Ain't (Ma' Baby?) were major morale-boosters for the American public during the war years.|$|E

Nobody {{was going to go to}} Hell by mistake." ...|$|E

In 2013 he said on Polish {{television}} that homosexual people have no right to a prominent role in politics, [...] "They <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that they are a minority and must adjust to smaller things". He also said homosexual MPs should sit [...] "behind a wall" [...] in a parliament. Despite sharp international criticism and a legal complaint of [...] "propaganda of hate against a sexual minority", Wałęsa refused to apologize for his comments. At a political rally in 2000, he described gay people as [...] "sick" [...] and said, [...] "I believe those people need medical treatment". During the drawing up of a new Polish Constitution in 1995, President Wałęsa argued against the inclusion of gay rights provisions. In 2014 City authorities of San Francisco renamed Walesa Street because of his [...] "anti-gay remarks". A deputy speaker of the Polish Parliament said Wałęsa's anti-gay position could jeopardize his international career as a human rights speaker.|$|E

500|$|Yeats {{was raised}} {{a member of}} the Protestant Ascendancy, which was at the time {{undergoing}} a crisis of identity. While his family was broadly supportive of the changes Ireland was experiencing, the nationalist revival of the late 19th century directly disadvantaged his heritage, and informed his outlook for the remainder of his life. In 1997, his biographer R. F. Foster observed that Napoleon's dictum that to understand the man you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> {{what was happening in the}} world when he was twenty [...] "is manifestly true of W.B.Y." [...] Yeats's childhood and young adulthood were shadowed by the power-shift away from the minority Protestant Ascendancy. The 1880s saw the rise of Charles Stewart Parnell and the home rule movement; the 1890s saw the momentum of nationalism, while the Catholics became prominent around the turn of the century. These developments had a profound effect on his poetry, and his subsequent explorations of Irish identity had a significant influence on the creation of his country's biography.|$|E
500|$|Sesame Street {{has used}} many writers in its long history. As Dave Connell, one of Sesame Streets {{original}} producers, has stated, {{it was difficult}} to find adults who could identify a preschooler's interest level. Fifteen writers a year worked on the show's scripts, but very few lasted longer than one season. Norman Stiles, head writer in 1987, reported that most writers would [...] "burn out" [...] after writing about a dozen scripts. According to Gikow, Sesame Street went against the convention of hiring teachers to write for the show, as most educational television programs did at the time. Instead, Cooney and the producers felt that {{it would be easier to}} teach writers how to interpret curriculum than to teach educators how to write comedy. As Stone stated, [...] "Writing for children is not so easy". Long-time writer Tony Geiss agreed, stating in 2009, [...] "It's not an easy show to write. You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the characters and the format and how to teach and be funny at the same time, which is a big, ambidextrous stunt".|$|E
500|$|Co-creator J. J. Abrams' {{inspiration}} for Fringe {{came from a}} range of sources, including the writings of Michael Crichton, the Ken Russell film Altered States, and the television series The X-Files and The Twilight Zone. The specific story for Fringe was developed during long conversations between series creators Abrams, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman. The team was discussing several different options, and the idea behind Fringe appealed to them most because it contained a long-term story and characters' backstories which were not [...] "evident but alluded to in the pilot". The team {{spent a lot of time}} thinking about the [...] "trifecta of characters" [...] that they needed to have in the series, and why there were uniquely interesting. The creators decided on the idea of a father-son story because it was compelling and accessible, [...] "you don't necessarily <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> anything about science, because everyone has a parent and everyone has issues with a parent. And I think for us it's always about coming into it through character". Orci stated that the series is a combination of a procedural and an [...] "extremely serialized and very culty" [...] series, quoting as examples of each, Law & Order and Lost.|$|E

500|$|VA Deputy Undersecretary for Health Administrative Operations William Schoenhard wrote a memo on March 15, 2013 {{indicating}} that the VA was changing its performance measure for appointment wait times. The new goal involved measuring {{the number of days}} between a veteran's desired appointment date and the actual date of the appointment. A VA Office of the Medical Inspector report from December 2013 showed a dramatic change in March 2013 of the number of appointments booked within the 14-day window for the Ft. Collins, Colorado outpatient clinic. When investigators asked VA employees to explain [...] "what occurred in March 2013" [...] the employees said that [...] "they were instructed by Business office staff to access the appointment schedule, review it for capacity, inform the Veteran of schedule availability, and then enter the Desired Date as the patient appointment date" [...] and [...] "By entering the Desired Date as the appointment date, the wait time … appears to be zero days." [...] The Ft. Collins clinic is overseen by the Cheyenne, Wyoming, Veterans Affairs office. A coordinator at the Cheyenne office sent an email on June 19, 2013 with instructions on how to manipulate the appointment dates. The coordinator wrote, [...] "Yes, it is gaming the system a bit, but you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> {{the rules of the game}} you are playing.” ...|$|E
500|$|Although the Mr. Hankey {{short film}} was never made, Parker and Stone made two Christmas-related {{animated}} short films called The Spirit of Christmas, {{which served as}} precursors to the South Park series. When the shorts began to generate interest for a possible television series, Parker and Stone originally conceived {{the idea of a}} South Park-like show with four children characters, but with a talking stool named Mr. Hankey as the show's main protagonist; they planned to call it [...] "The Mr. Hankey Show". They pitched the idea to friend Brian Graden, then a television executive with the Fox Broadcasting Company, but he rejected it and said, according to Matt Stone, [...] "I'm not putting poo on my network". Parker and Stone adapted their original idea into a show revolving around the South Park town and four children without Mr. Hankey as a protagonist, but they planned to revive the character as a minor supporting role in a future episode. Later, when Comedy Central expressed interest in the series, Parker and Stone brought up the idea of a Mr. Hankey episode during negotiations with the network executives. Parker claimed during a meeting, he said, [...] "One thing we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> before we really go any further: {{how do you feel about}} talking poo?" [...] The executives were receptive to the idea, which Parker said was one of the main reasons he and Stone decided to sign on with the channel.|$|E
500|$|Although Salman Khan was {{initially}} signed {{for the lead}} role, he later withdrew due to creative differences with the director. Shah Rukh Khan (who had originally declined due to a scheduling conflict with Karan Johar's Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna) was later confirmed as Kabir Khan. Khan accepted the role partly because he used to play hockey in college: [...] "I feel hockey as a sport has been monstrously neglected in our country. I used {{to play the game}} during college. In fact, I was quite a good hockey player. So the role was a lot like going back to my past." [...] Some media sources called the actor's role offbeat, since it departed from his usual romantic image and included neither lip synched songs nor a single female lead. Casting of the 16 actresses as the hockey players took over six months. Amin described the process as [...] "very, very difficult" [...] and [...] "very strenuous because the requirement was they had to play – and act". A four-month training camp was held where the girls learned the rules of the game, took acting lessons and followed a strict diet; safety precautions were also taken. According to Amin, [...] "Learning hockey is very tricky unlike, say, football. You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how to hold the stick, how to manoeuvre it, so it doesn't look fake on screen ... For those who were originally players, we had {{to make sure they were}} able to act as well. The dialogue was weighty; it isn't frivolous. It has to be delivered with a certain tone, in a certain manner". The actors, including Khan and the rest of the supporting cast, participated in a number of rehearsals and script readings before principal photography began.|$|E
