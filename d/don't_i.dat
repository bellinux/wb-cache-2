And I wasn't really well, as in health; I couldn't move freely. And then I {{was tired of}} playing a game, for {{instance}} playing this beautiful young woman, and I was heavy and uncomfortable to move around. In any case, it was uncomfortable and I didn't like it. So I felt now if I'm going to do things right—I've studied all my life to put things right musically, so why <b>don't</b> <b>I</b> diet and put myself into a certain condition where I'm presentable.|$|E

In his next start, Zito struggled. He went six innings but allowed eight earned runs against the Los Angeles Dodgers.

The Colts' scouts initially favored Leaf, but the team's management and coaches were gradually won over by Manning's attitude, particularly as Manning showed up prepared to a scheduled interview meeting with the Colts' staff while Leaf arrived late. Colts general manager Bill Polian who had the final say on the draft selection recalled Manning saying [...] "I'll leave you with this thought.

500|$|Etty {{landed in}} Dieppe, {{and made his}} way to Paris via Rouen. Although he {{admitted}} to finding France a beautiful country, he was unhappy throughout his stay there, suffering from severe homesickness; shortly after his arrival in Paris he wrote to his cousin Martha Bodley that [...] "I hope I shall like Italy better than Paris, or I think I shall not feel resolution to stop a year. If I <b>don't,</b> <b>I</b> shall content myself with seeing what I think worth while; and then return." [...] He travelled onwards via Geneva, but found Switzerland frustrating; although he had brought his own tea-making equipment with him, in the remoter mountain villages he found it difficult to obtain milk for his tea. Travelling through the Simplon Pass to Piedmont revived his spirits somewhat; he found the variety of colour in the landscapes of northern Italy fascinating, and in late September arrived in Florence.|$|E
500|$|This classic {{scene was}} born {{when the film}} started to focus too much on Harry.

[...] Ryan suggested that the scene take place in a restaurant, and it was Crystal who came up with the scene's classic punchline – [...] "I'll have what she's having." [...] In 2005, the quote was listed 33rd on the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes list of memorable movie lines.

However, {{by the time}} of his final tour in 2009—the year he died—he had stopped receiving requests for it. In an October 2009 interview, Howard commented on his relationship with the song, and its position in his setlists, stating: [...] "I have just tried, perhaps finally successfully, to divorce myself from the song. It's impossible for me to recreate what I was trying to do when I wrote that song so whilst I can see that people have an attachment to it, I <b>don't.</b> <b>I</b> feel like, when I did use to do it in shows, I was doing a cover of some song that had been around forever.

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] was {{directed}} by Alex De Rakoff in early November 2004. Clarkson told MTV that she conceived {{the idea of the}} video after assuming that revenge is what every girl wants to do when their boyfriend cheats on them. She added, [...] "You know, 'Why <b>don't</b> <b>I</b> just go trash her house? [...] And so I do it in the video. All I do is break stuff. It's a cool job. I could get used to this." [...] Clarkson expressed that in the music video, viewers would get to see her act out of character. She explained, [...] "In the beginning, I'm like tipping things over and smearing mud all over the walls and it seems like my apartment, but it ends up being the other girl's that he's with, so it's a humorous video." [...] The music video premiered on Total Request Live on November 16, 2004.|$|E
500|$|Rinder {{told the}} Tampa Bay Times that interrogations [...] "would {{be carried out}} by whoever {{happened}} to be there– 20 people, 30 people, 50 people, all standing up and screaming at you, and ultimately it sort of devolved into physical violence, torture, to extricate these 'confessions' out of people." [...] According to Rinder, the confessions were sometimes dictated by Miscavige, but more usually the inmates of the Hole would force each other to confess: [...] "The 50 people there are all screaming at me, telling me I've got to confess– I've done that, why <b>don't</b> <b>I</b> just admit it? I stole money, I had affairs– people would just literally dream up bullshit and start screaming it out, and then the mob goes crazy: 'Oh yeah, it must have been that!'" [...] Tom De Vocht, who was also in the Hole, recalled that [...] "everybody in that damned room— people are wild and out of control, I punched somebody. Everybody was punched. And screaming and yelling. It just got like, 'What {{the hell is going on}} here?'" [...] De Vocht rationalized his own involvement on the grounds of self-defense: [...] "If I don't attack I'm going to be attacked. It's a survival instinct in a weird situation that no one should be in." ...|$|E
500|$|Spears's manager Adam Leber {{responded in}} his Twitter account, saying, [...] "It's unfortunate that one {{journalist}} in Perth didn't enjoy the show last night. Fortunately the other 18,272 fans in attendance did". Spears's official website also posted {{a list of}} positive reviews {{from a number of}} fans. Burswood Dome also issued a statament reading, [...] "Last night's concert (Friday) saw record crowds turn out for her first performance in Perth and from Burswood's perspective the event was a huge success. Early media reports that hundreds of fans left the concert early cannot be substantiated and Burswood has received no complaints about the concert". Finally, Spears addressed the situation according to BBC Online. She was quoted as saying, [...] "I hear {{there is a lot of}} controversy in the media about my show. Some reporters have said they love it and some <b>don't.</b> <b>I</b> came to Australia for my fans". The negative media attention continued after her show in Melbourne when it was alleged that fans had placed tickets for the remaining Australian shows on sale on the online shopping website eBay, for as little as 99 cents. However, Dainty said that the holders of the tickets were not Spears's fans, stating [...] "They're just profiteers. They buy tickets for $200 and think they that when the concerts sell-out they will offload them for $500".|$|E

500|$|Many {{people within}} Major League Baseball spoke out {{in support of}} Joyce, {{offering}} their sympathies and noting his exceptional reputation. New York Yankees pitcher Mariano Rivera said, [...] "It happened to the best umpire {{we have in our}} game. The best. And a perfect gentleman. ... It's a shame for both of them, for the pitcher and for the umpire. But I'm telling you he is the best baseball has, and a great guy. It's just a shame." [...] Former Chicago Cubs pitcher Milt Pappas said, [...] "I would tell , 'I feel for you. There have been only 20 perfect games in the history of baseball. The umpire situation was the same one I had—they blew it. At least I had the satisfaction of getting the no-hitter. You <b>don't.</b> <b>I</b> feel for you. You pitched a tremendous game. At least you have the satisfaction of the umpire saying he was sorry. But that doesn't help your situation as far as a perfect game." [...] Pappas' own bid for a perfect game on September 2, 1972, was spoiled when umpire Bruce Froemming called a borderline 3-and-2 pitch to 27th-batter Larry Stahl a ball, issuing a walk to the pinch-hitter. Former Yankees pitcher Don Larsen—who threw the fourth perfect game of the modern era and the only one in World Series history on October 8, 1956—said, [...] "I feel sorry for the umpire, and I just feel real badly for the kid. He's probably wondering right now whose side God is on." ...|$|E
