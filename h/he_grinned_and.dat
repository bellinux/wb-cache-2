500|$|Nesbitt {{returned}} to theatre acting in June 2005 {{when he appeared}} in David Nicholls' After Sun, a ten-minute-play performed {{as part of the}} Old Vic's 24-Hour Play season. Nesbitt and Catherine Tate starred as a married couple who meet a pair of newlyweds returning from their honeymoon. Later that year, he appeared in his first full-length play in 11 years, in Owen McCafferty's Shoot the Crow. He enjoyed the stimulation of learning his lines and rehearsing with the cast and director. The play opened at the Trafalgar Studios in September 2005 and his role as Socrates gained mixed reviews. In The Independent, Michael Coveney suggested the role did not fit the actor: [...] "Nesbitt is cool. But I never felt that he was inside his role of a chap called Socrates [...] <b>He</b> <b>grinned</b> <b>and</b> shrugged through the evening which steadily became less about grouting on tiles and more about grating on nerves." [...] In The Daily Telegraph, Charles Spencer described Nesbitt's acting as [...] "outstanding".|$|E
2500|$|Greig {{was born}} to a Scottish {{immigrant}} father and a South African-born mother, and was educated at Queen's College, Queenstown, South Africa. Many former Sussex players had been recruited to coach the cricket team at Queen's Collegeâ€”during Greig's schooldays, Jack Oakes, Alan Oakman, Ian Thomson, Ron Bell, Richard Langridge and Mike Buss all came from overseas for off-season work. All of them noticed Greig's developing abilities which, after a first-class debut for Border Province in the Currie Cup, led to a trial at Sussex when Greig was 19. Greig's father helped him decide between university study or pursuit of the Sussex offer. [...] "He used to slam into me for not reading enough, for being generally immature. He {{would look at me}} sometimes and say 'Boy, when I was your age I was fighting a war', but in the end <b>he</b> <b>grinned</b> <b>and</b> said: 'Go over to England for one year, one year mind, and see what you can do'".|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>grinned,</b> <b>and</b> {{said that}} it was an {{establishment}} without dogs.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Felix, [...] "he IS like a dog--very honest; <b>he</b> <b>grins</b> <b>and</b> {{runs about}} the city, {{and might be}} {{inclined}} to bay the moon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Vanine, {{that looked}} {{on all the}} danger past, [...] Because he 'scaped so long, is seized at last; [...] By p----, by hunger, and by Dryden bit, [...] <b>He</b> <b>grins</b> <b>and</b> snarls, and, in his dogged fit, [...] Froths at the mouth, a certain sign of wit." ...|$|R
60|$|Spike looked {{somewhat}} embarrassed. <b>He</b> <b>grinned</b> apologetically, <b>and</b> shuffled his feet.|$|R
60|$|His pause was significant. <b>He</b> <b>grinned,</b> <b>and</b> {{his brown}} eyes danced {{with a kind of}} wild humor.|$|E
60|$|But <b>he</b> <b>grinned</b> <b>and</b> {{shook his}} head, and though I {{had made a}} good bargain, I was unpleasantly aware {{that he had made}} a better one.|$|E
6000|$|Cy Bogart covered Fern's nervous {{hand with}} his red paw, {{and when she}} bounced with half-anger and shrieked, [...] "Let go, I tell you!" [...] <b>he</b> <b>grinned</b> <b>and</b> waved his pipe--a gangling twenty-year-old satyr.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>grinned</b> vindictively, <b>and</b> the {{correspondent}} {{seemed to}} lose all interest.|$|R
6000|$|But now for authors nobler palms remain; Room for my lord! three jockeys in his train; Six huntsmen with a shout precede his chair: <b>He</b> <b>grins,</b> <b>and</b> looks broad {{nonsense}} with a stare. His honour's meaning Dulness thus express'd, 'He {{wins this}} patron, who can tickle best.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Rose, Dennel and Robsen {{find that}} their station is moving faster now that it's {{out of the trees}} and {{approaching}} the building, so they decide to jump out. They see the Doctor and Flowers emerge from it, and when Rose jumps, the Doctor catches her, but they both fall. <b>He</b> <b>grins</b> <b>and</b> says 'Found you.' ...|$|R
60|$|The braves quieted {{down after}} that, and soon lapsed into slumber, leaving the big fellow, {{to whom the}} chief had {{addressed}} his brief command, acting, as guard. Observing Joe watching him as he puffed on his new pipe, <b>he</b> <b>grinned,</b> <b>and</b> spoke in broken English that was intelligible, and much of a surprise to the young man.|$|E
6000|$|Very proud looked Peter as {{he stood}} under a bramble-bush with Mrs. Peter by his side and {{introduced}} her to his many friends, and very sweet and modest and retiring looked little Mrs. Peter as she sat beside him. Everybody {{said that she was}} [...] "too sweet for anything", and when Reddy Fox overheard that remark <b>he</b> <b>grinned</b> <b>and</b> said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] said he, {{with his}} clumsy and {{ponderous}} sarcasm, [...] "Professor Summerlee {{will understand that}} when I speak of a pterodactyl I mean a stork--only {{it is the kind}} of stork which has no feathers, a leathery skin, membranous wings, and teeth in its jaws." [...] <b>He</b> <b>grinned</b> <b>and</b> blinked and bowed until his colleague turned and walked away.|$|E
60|$|The man {{once more}} {{gazed at her}} with such evident bewilderment that Muriel broke into a little half-audible laugh. Then <b>he</b> <b>grinned</b> suddenly, <b>and</b> touched his {{battered}} cap.|$|R
60|$|Turning {{his head}} slowly and with a gesture of ineffable contempt, Good swept his hand across his mouth. Then <b>he</b> <b>grinned</b> again, <b>and</b> lo, there were two rows of lovely teeth.|$|R
60|$|I peeped into Charles Davis's room. It was terrible. <b>He</b> <b>grinned</b> to me <b>and</b> {{nodded his}} head.|$|R
60|$|The old monkey {{would hardly}} have been troubled {{if they had not}} got their faces washed for the next month to come; but <b>he</b> <b>grinned</b> <b>and</b> talked as Toby trudged along, {{attempting}} to catch hold of the leaves as they were passed, and in various other ways impeding his master's progress, until Toby was obliged to give him a most severe scolding in order to make him behave himself in anything like a decent manner.|$|E
6000|$|I {{had faced}} about so {{abruptly}} that I had not telegraphed to my servant. He was therefore {{not at the}} station to meet me, but he poked out his head from an upper window when I reached the house. [...] "They have put her into the earth, la vecchia," [...] {{he said to me}} in the lower hall, while he shouldered my valise; and <b>he</b> <b>grinned</b> <b>and</b> almost winked, as if he knew I should be pleased at the news.|$|E
60|$|Ralph laughed aloud {{and began}} to climb the pinnacle. He might have waited till Jan, who was {{struggling}} up the pass after them, arrived with his gun, {{but he would not}} wait. He had no fear of the man above and he was certain of the issue of the fray, for he knew that God is just. As for that man above, <b>he</b> <b>grinned</b> <b>and</b> gibbered in his disappointed rage and the agony of his dread; yes, he stood there by the painted corpse and gibbered like an ape.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure enough. If I {{only had}} {{you for a}} mother-in-law-that's why I'm so poor. Nobody to keep me moving. If I had someone to do the talking for me, I'd work." [...] <b>He</b> <b>grinned</b> broadly <b>and</b> drove out.|$|R
60|$|Grandfather Frog {{saw them}} coming, and he guessed {{right away that}} they were coming for a story. <b>He</b> <b>grinned</b> to himself <b>and</b> pretended to go to sleep.|$|R
6000|$|But to Mr. Pynsent the {{transaction}} appeared perfectly simple--there {{was no reason}} present to his mind why people should not drink tea at six if they were minded, {{as well as at}} any other hour; and he asked of Mr. Wagg, when they went away, [...] "What the devil <b>he</b> was <b>grinning</b> <b>and</b> winking at, and what amused him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|One {{day he had}} ventured as far as {{halfway up}} the Crooked Little Path. He was {{thinking}} so hard of a surprise he was planning for little Mrs. Peter that he forgot to watch out and almost ran into Old Man Coyote before he saw him. There was a hungry look, such a hungry look in Old Man Coyote's eyes as <b>he</b> <b>grinned</b> <b>and</b> said [...] "Good morning" [...] that Peter didn't even stop to be polite. He remembered that Jimmy Skunk's old house was near, and he reached it just one jump ahead of Old Man Coyote.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, Madame,' said Osbert; 'it did my {{very heart}} {{good to see}} him writhing there like a crushed viper. M. le Baron's bullet was mortal, and his own people thought him not worth the moving, so there he lies on the ground howling and cursing. I would have given him {{the coup de grace}} myself, but that I thought M. le Baron might have some family matters to settle with him; so I only asked what he thought now of {{clapping}} guiltless folk into dungeons, and shooting innocent children like sparrows; but <b>he</b> <b>grinned</b> <b>and</b> cursed like a demon, and I left him.' ...|$|E
60|$|He {{had been}} {{tramping}} through the Green Forest {{late in the}} afternoon and just by chance happened across Granny's footprints. Just for fun he followed them and so came to the sunny knoll. Granny had left some time before, but of course she couldn't take the print of her body with her. That remained in the snow, and Farmer Brown's boy saw it and knew instantly what it meant. <b>He</b> <b>grinned,</b> <b>and</b> could Granny Fox have seen that grin, she would have been uncomfortable. You see, he knew that he had found the place where Granny was in the habit of taking a sun-nap.|$|E
60|$|Santos, looking immensely {{relieved}} and grateful, though {{a little surprised}} at my confident tone, was hurrying out when I pointed to the saddle-bags. <b>He</b> nodded, <b>grinned,</b> <b>and,</b> snatching them up, left the room. Poor old Ramona threw herself on to her knees, sobbing and pouring out farewell blessings on her mistress, kissing her hands and hair with sorrowful devotion.|$|R
6000|$|... "Fewer {{than there}} used to be?--I see what you mean," [...] said Mitchy. [...] "But if it has struck you so, that's awfully interesting." [...] <b>He</b> glared <b>and</b> <b>grinned</b> <b>and</b> mused. [...] "I wonder." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{never was}} afraid to speak my mind," [...] went on Smith. Here <b>he</b> lost his <b>grin</b> <b>and</b> his coarse mouth grew hard. [...] "Gulden {{will have to be}} killed if we're goin' to last!" ...|$|R
6000|$|The fellow {{looked at}} me for a while in a puzzled sort of way; then <b>he</b> <b>grinned,</b> <b>and</b> {{swinging}} on his heel strode away, I following close behind him with the pistol ready cocked in my hand. We went onward in this way for about half a mile, until we came to a little hut that stood by itself beyond the rest of the town. My guide stopped short about fifty paces away from the hut. [...] "There's where you'll find Ned England," [...] said he, [...] "and I'll go no farther for ten guineas, for I've no notion of catching the black tongue; and if you'll hearken to a bit of advice, shipmate, you'll give it a wide berth yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{stare at}} me as though you never saw me out of a garret before," [...] she went on, a little sharply. [...] "Your friend Miss Dalstan is a lady who understands things. When I arrived at the theatre this morning I {{found that it was}} to be a {{permanent}} job all right, and there was a little advance for me waiting in an envelope. That fat old Mr. Fink began to cough and look at my clothes, so I got one in first. 'This is for me to make myself look smart enough for your theatre, I suppose?' I said. 'Give me an hour off, and I'll do it.' So <b>he</b> <b>grinned,</b> <b>and</b> here I am. Done a good day's work, too, copying the parts of your play for a road company, and answering letters. What's wrong with you?" ...|$|E
60|$|Thus far {{not very}} many pennies had been given him, and, used at last to his strange looks, the less polite {{passengers}} of those {{in that part of}} the boat began to get their fill of him as a curious object; when suddenly the negro more than revived their first interest by an expedient which, whether by chance or design, was a singular temptation at once to diversion and charity, though, even more than his crippled limbs, it put him on a canine footing. In short, as in appearance he seemed a dog, so now, in a merry way, like a dog he began to be treated. Still shuffling among the crowd, now and then he would pause, throwing back his head and, opening his mouth like an elephant for tossed apples at a menagerie; when, making a space before him, people would have a bout at a strange sort of pitch-penny game, the cripple's mouth being at once target and purse, and he hailing each expertly-caught copper with a cracked bravura from his tambourine. To be the subject of alms-giving is trying, and to feel in duty bound to appear cheerfully grateful under the trial, must be still more so; but whatever his secret emotions, he swallowed them, while still retaining each copper this side the oesophagus. And nearly always <b>he</b> <b>grinned,</b> <b>and</b> only once or twice did he wince, which was when certain coins, tossed by more playful almoners, came inconveniently nigh to his teeth, an accident whose unwelcomeness was not unedged by the circumstance that the pennies thus thrown proved buttons.|$|E
60|$|Mr Browdie was not {{a gentleman}} of great {{conversational}} powers, so <b>he</b> <b>grinned</b> twice more, <b>and</b> having now bestowed his customary mark of recognition on every person in company, grinned at nothing in particular, and helped himself to food.|$|R
60|$|After a long, long time, Spotty the Turtle came to {{a little}} pool where the {{sunshine}} lay warm and inviting. There, {{in the middle of}} it, on a mossy stone, sat Grandfather Frog fast asleep. He had thought that he was so far ahead of Spotty that he could safely rest his tired legs. Spotty wanted to climb right up beside him and take a nap too, but he didn't. <b>He</b> just <b>grinned</b> <b>and</b> kept right on going.|$|R
60|$|At length <b>he</b> {{came back}} <b>grinning</b> <b>and</b> washing {{the blade of}} his knife in the water. I spoke {{fiercely}} to him in my own language, <b>and</b> still <b>he</b> <b>grinned</b> on, making no answer. When we were mounted again and riding away from that horrible boat with its groaning prisoner, watching Bes whose behaviour and silence I could not understand, I saw him sweep his hand across his great mouth and thrust it swiftly into his bosom. After this he spoke readily enough, though {{in a low voice}} lest someone who understood Egyptian should overhear him.|$|R
