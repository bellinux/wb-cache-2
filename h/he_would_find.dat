5|$|Kukunoor had not visited Rajasthan or Himachal Pradesh before, but he {{felt that}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>find</b> great {{locations}} there. Salooni in Chamba district is considered for shooting in Himachal Pradesh. In spite of this geographical inexperience, all went as per the plans while shooting in Rajasthan. However, minor modifications in the script were allowed for the surroundings. Though Panag had been in Rajasthan, she felt the scorching summer heat unbearable at times. She liked the only continuous shooting schedule and said that it provided consistency in look and performance. In Himachal, it was slightly different when the crew had hard time framing the mountains correctly. On seeing the captured frames, they shifted all the interior shots to outside.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 17th century, much of North America had been claimed by European countries. Spain had claimed Florida {{as well as}} modern-day Mexico {{and much of the}} southwestern part of the continent. The {{northern}} and central Atlantic coast was claimed by Britain, and New France comprised much of what is now eastern Canada as well as the central Illinois Country. The French feared that their territory was vulnerable to the expansionist aims of its neighbors. In 1681, French nobleman Robert Cavelier de La Salle launched an expedition down the Mississippi River from New France, at first believing <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>find</b> a path to the Pacific Ocean. Instead, La Salle found a route to the Gulf of Mexico. Although Hernando De Soto had explored and claimed this area for Spain 140years before, on April 9, 1682, La Salle claimed the Mississippi River valley for French king Louis XIV, naming the territory Louisiana in his honor.|$|E
5|$|In the {{economic}} austerity of post-war Britain, Larwood's business made little money. He was persuaded, largely by his erstwhile opponent Jack Fingleton, that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>find</b> better prospects {{and a warm}} welcome in Australia, {{and he decided to}} emigrate there with his family, which by then included five daughters. On 1 April 1950 the Larwoods sailed on SS Orontes—the ship that had carried Jardine's party 18 years previously. On arrival in Australia the welcome was warm and immediate. During their initial weeks in a Sydney hotel, unbeknown to them half their bills were paid by the former prime minister Ben Chifley. Despite a housing shortage, the family was soon settled in a bungalow in the Sydney suburb of Kingsford, and Larwood found steady employment with a soft drinks firm. Fingleton later arranged a meeting between Larwood and Chifley; their respective broad Nottinghamshire and Australian accents meant that neither could understand the other, and Fingleton had to act as an interpreter.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, the Caliph {{was brought}} to Raqqa for greater safety, while Husayn ibn Sa'id tried to secure control over {{northern}} Syria and pre-empt Egypt's ruler Muhammad ibn Tughj al-Ikhshid {{taking control of the}} region. The attempt failed, as al-Ikhshid himself advanced into Syria, took Aleppo and marched to Raqqa, where he met the Caliph. Al-Ikhshid tried to persuade al-Muttaqi to come to Egypt under his protection, but the Caliph refused, and al-Ikhsid returned to Egypt. Instead, al-Muttaqi, persuaded by Tuzun's assurances of loyalty and safety, returned to Baghdad, where Tuzun deposed and blinded him, replacing him with al-Mustakfi (r. 944–946). At the news of this crime, Nasir al-Dawla again refused payment of tribute, but Tuzun marched against him and forced his compliance. Henceforth, Nasir al-Dawla would be tributary to Baghdad, but <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>find</b> it difficult to resign himself to his loss of power over the city he once ruled, and the subsequent years would feature several attempts to regain it.|$|E
5|$|While the Japanese {{were able}} to launch 108 {{aircraft}} in just seven minutes, it took Enterprise and Hornet over an hour to launch 117. Spruance judged that the need to throw something at the enemy {{as soon as possible}} was greater than the need to coordinate the attack by aircraft of different types and speeds (fighters, bombers, and torpedo bombers). Accordingly, American squadrons were launched piecemeal and proceeded to the target in several different groups. It was accepted that the lack of coordination would diminish the impact of the American attacks and increase their casualties, but Spruance calculated that this was worthwhile, since keeping the Japanese under aerial attack impaired their ability to launch a counterstrike (Japanese tactics preferred fully constituted attacks), and he gambled that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>find</b> Nagumo with his flight decks at their most vulnerable.|$|E
25|$|He assumed <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>find</b> {{a team of}} {{officers}} there, but {{when he reached the}} 27th floor he found only Cowan, Crum, and Day.|$|E
50|$|In {{his search}} for quotes, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> read eight daily newspapers, seven weekly magazines, and a dozen monthlies. In any given day, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> usually <b>find</b> about eight or ten quotes of {{interest}} that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> choose to save.|$|R
60|$|When after a long, long hunt {{he found}} Jimmy Skunk, Jimmy {{was very much}} out of sorts. In fact Jimmy Skunk was {{positively}} cross. You see, he hadn't had any breakfast, for hunt as <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>he</b> couldn't <b>find</b> a single beetle.|$|R

25|$|In his lifetime, King {{had been}} an avid {{supporter}} of Hamilton and his Fiscal programs and unsurprisingly that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>find</b> himself also {{become one of the}} directors of the Hamilton-sponsored First Bank of the United States. Among other prominent things that occurred in King's life, he was first elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1805, and was also elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1814.|$|E
25|$|During the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy Harmison's form {{came under}} scrutiny, {{and he was}} dropped from England's final match against the West Indies. In November 2006, Harmison bowled the first ball of the eagerly awaited 2006-07 Ashes series at the Gabba in Brisbane, but erred by bowling a wide {{straight}} to Andrew Flintoff at second slip. After another below par performance in Adelaide <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>find</b> some form in Perth with 4/48 in the 1st innings.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Direck {{took his}} leave of Mrs. Britling, and went very slowly towards the little cottage. But {{he did not}} go to the cottage. <b>He</b> felt <b>he</b> <b>would</b> only <b>find</b> another soul in torment there.|$|R

25|$|Next, Chaloner {{proposed}} that Thomas Coppinger (or Matthew Coppinger), an unscrupulous thief taker specializing in coining offences, should write a treasonable satire, and <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>find</b> a Jacobite printer whom they would jointly denounce to the authorities. However, in May 1694 Coppinger denounced Chaloner for coining and Lord Mayor Sir Thomas Stampe {{sent him to}} Newgate. Chaloner then turned the tables and testified against Coppinger, who was executed on 27 February 1695 (or 22 February 1695).|$|E
25|$|During World War II, {{for seven}} months of each year, the trio's filming {{schedule}} would go on hiatus, allowing them to make personal appearances. The Stooges entertained servicemen constantly, and the intense work schedule took its toll on Curly. He never drank while performing in film or on stage; Moe would not allow it. But once away from Moe's watchful eye, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>find</b> the nearest nightclub, down a few drinks, and enjoy himself. His drinking, eating, and carousing increased. He had difficulties managing his finances, often spending his money on wine, food, women, homes, cars, and especially dogs, and was often near bankruptcy. Moe eventually helped him manage his money and even filled out his income tax returns.|$|E
25|$|After Johnson quit {{attending}} school, {{he began}} a job working at the local docks, soon discovering that he hated it. He made several other attempts at working other jobs around town, until one day {{he made his way}} to Dallas, finding work at the race track exercising horses. Jack stuck with this job until <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>find</b> a new apprenticeship for a carriage painter by the name of Walter Lewis. Lewis, who had a passion for boxing, enjoyed watching friends spar, and although boxing was somewhat new to Johnson, he began to learn how to hit hard and strong. Johnson later claimed that it was thanks to Lewis that he would become a boxer.|$|E

50|$|During his career, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> often <b>find</b> himself {{embroiled in}} semi-comical {{situations}} inadvertently initiated by Winky, Blinky, and Noddy, {{a trio of}} tramps known as the Three Dimwits, who tried their hand at one job after another, and never successfully.|$|R
25|$|After leaving Carolus-Duran's atelier, Sargent visited Spain. There {{he studied}} the {{paintings}} of Velázquez with a passion, absorbing the master's technique, and in his travels gathered ideas for future works. He was entranced with Spanish music and dance. The trip also re-awakened his own talent for music (which was nearly equal to his artistic talent), and which found visual expression in his early masterpiece El Jaleo (1882). Music would {{continue to play a}} major part in his social life as well, as he was a skillful accompanist of both amateur and professional musicians. Sargent became a strong advocate for modern composers, especially Gabriel Fauré. Trips to Italy provided sketches and ideas for several Venetian street scenes genre paintings, which effectively captured gestures and postures <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>find</b> useful in later portraiture.|$|E
25|$|Born in 1863 {{in an area}} later {{incorporated}} into the Canadian province of Ontario, Day completed his education, and took up {{a job as a}} stagecoach driver. Soon after, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>find</b> employment at the Massey-Harris company, an agricultural equipment manufacturer. During this time, Day first surveyed the land that he would eventually settle later on in his life. After briefly working as a loan company, Day moved to the west, after having aspirations of doing so since his youth. As the Canadian Pacific Railway gained entitlement to a portion of land in the prairies, Day became interested in purchasing a large portion, and did so in 1904. He then completed plans for what would later become the town that bears his name, Daysland, in present-day Flagstaff County, Alberta.|$|E
25|$|Fairbridge {{applied to}} the Rhodes {{trustees}} for a scholarship, feeling that once in England <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>find</b> ways of developing his scheme. He was informed by the Rhodes trustees that if he passed the Oxford entrance examination his application would be favourably considered, and in 1906 he went to England to be privately coached. After his fourth attempt, he succeeded in passing the required examination. In October 1908 Fairbridge entered Exeter College, Oxford, with a Rhodes Scholarship. In 1909 he published an anthology of poetry entitled Veld Verse and Other Lines. He began to write on child emigration until he was advised by a friend that speaking would be more effective. Fairbridge was rebuffed by the British South Africa Company, which informed him that they considered Rhodesia too young {{a country in which}} to start child emigration. The Premier of Newfoundland, however, provided support for the concept.|$|E
6000|$|Our Scotsman {{went off}} without delay in {{response}} to the message, and was thus prevented from carrying out his [...] "fixed resolve" [...] just then. However, he wouldn't give in, not <b>he!</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> soon <b>find</b> a more convenient opportunity.|$|R
50|$|When not ring announcing or commentating, McGuirk's job was {{producing}} promos back stage. She explained {{in an interview}} that Vince McMahon would not let his employees just sit around back stage, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> always <b>find</b> something for them to do while being paid.|$|R
60|$|His heart thumped violently {{against his}} ribs. He {{looked for the}} {{revolver}} everywhere. He hunted in the chairs and in the drawers. He looked desperately, {{and all the time}} <b>he</b> knew <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>find</b> it. Suddenly he heard Walker's gruff, hearty voice.|$|R
25|$|In {{its heyday}} of the 1930s through the 1950s, CCNY became known for its {{political}} radicalism. It was said that the old CCNY cafeteria {{in the basement of}} Shepard Hall, particularly in alcove 1, was {{the only place in the}} world where a fair debate between Trotskyists and Stalinists could take place. Being part of a political debate that began in the morning in alcove 1, Irving Howe reported that after some time had passed he would leave his place among the arguing students in order to attend class. When he returned to the cafeteria late in the day, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>find</b> that the same debate had continued but with an entirely different cast of students. Alumni who were at City College in the mid-20th century said that City College in those days made the famously radicalism three decades later at the University of California at Berkeley in the 1960s look like a school of conformity.|$|E
25|$|When Hall {{agreed to}} the design role and was {{appointed}} in April 1966, he imagined <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>find</b> the design and documentation for the Stage III well advanced. What he found was {{an enormous amount of}} work ahead of him with many aspects completely unresolved by Utzon in relation to seating capacity, acoustics and structure. In addition Hall found the project had proceeded for nine years without the development of a concise client brief. To bring himself up to speed, Hall investigated concert and opera venues overseas and engaged stage consultant Ben Schlange and acoustic consultant Wilhelm Jordan, while establishing his team. In consultation with all the potential building users the first Review of Program was completed in January 1967. The most significant conclusion reached by Hall was that concert and opera were incompatible in the same hall. Although Utzon had sketched ideas using plywood for the great enclosing glass walls their structural viability was unresolved when Hall took on the design role. With the ability to delegate tasks and effectively coordinate the work of consultants, Hall guided the project for over five years until the opening day in 1973.|$|E
25|$|An {{exchange}} of telegrams ensued between the War Office in London and Gordon in Bombay about just what exactly {{he was planning}} on doing in China, and when Gordon replied that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>find</b> out when he got there, Gordon was ordered to stay. Gordon disobeyed orders and left on the first ship to China, an action that very much angered the Army's commander, the Duke of Cambridge. Gordon arrived in Shanghai in July and met Li Hongzhang, and learned that there was risk of war with Russia. After meeting his old friend, Gordon assured Li that if Russia should attack he would resign his commission in the British Army {{to take up a}} commission in the Chinese Army, an action that if taken risked prosecution under the Foreign Enlistments Act. Gordon informed the Foreign Office that he willing to renounce his British citizenship and take Chinese citizenship as he would not abandon Li and his other Chinese friends should a Sino-Russian war begin. Gordon's willingness to renounce his British citizenship in order to fight with China in the event of war did much to raise his prestige in China.|$|E
