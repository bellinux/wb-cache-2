5|$|In {{addition}} to entertainment and artistic merit, LARP <b>events</b> <b>may</b> be designed for educational or political purposes. For example, the Danish secondary school Østerskov Efterskole uses LARP to teach {{most of its}} classes. Language classes can be taught by immersing students in a role-playing scenario {{in which they are}} forced to improvise speech or writing in the language they are learning. Politically themed LARP <b>events</b> <b>may</b> attempt to awaken or shape political thinking within a culture.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the comic}} book series Haunted, Adam was once a human member of the Initiative tasked with {{protecting}} Professor Walsh. The ghost of Mayor Richard Wilkins, however, took over {{the body of a}} vampire, which was then captured by the Initiative. Desperate to escape, the Mayor moved to the body of a dead demon and killed Adam. Having been one of her favorite agents, Professor Walsh vowed to bring him back to life and placed his body in her 314 Project. However, due to the complex nature of the Buffyverse, this chain of <b>events</b> <b>may</b> not, in fact, be canonical.|$|E
5|$|Brawl {{contains}} 41selectable stages, 29 {{of which}} are initially available. Many stages undergo elaborate changes while battles take place, such as a cycling day-to-night system and changing seasons. A stage based on the Animal Crossing series features a live events system in which special <b>events</b> <b>may</b> occur depending on the date and time. Environmental gameplay mechanics are featured in this installment, such as destructible terrain {{and the ability to}} float. Unlike its predecessors, Brawl includes stages based on third-party games such as the Metal Gear Solid-inspired Shadow Moses Island. The game also includes stages taken from its predecessor, Super Smash Bros. Melee.|$|E
5|$|Differentiating {{the various}} periods {{of human history}} {{involved}} is a complex task. The Paleolithic lasted until the retreat of the ice, the Mesolithic until the adoption of farming and the Neolithic until metalworking commenced. These <b>events</b> <b>may</b> have begun at different times {{in different parts of}} the country. A number of the sites span very long periods of time and in particular the distinctions between the Neolithic and the later periods are not clear cut.|$|E

5|$|Furry {{conventions}} {{are usually}} run and staffed by volunteers, though venues may require certain activities to be contracted out. Event funding typically relies on convention registrations. Many {{of the larger}} conventions are incorporated as non-profit organizations, usually to achieve tax-exempt status and safeguard the organizers' personal assets - in the US, some are 501(c)(3) charities, while others are registered as recreational clubs. The largest <b>events</b> <b>may</b> require up to a hundred volunteers, not including gofers. Volunteers are thanked for their participation during the closing ceremonies, which are usually well-attended, and often receive T-shirts or other benefits.|$|E
5|$|Tectonics-based {{events will}} {{continue}} to occur well into {{the future and the}} surface will be steadily reshaped by tectonic uplift, extrusions, and erosion. Mount Vesuvius can be expected to erupt about 40 times over the next 1,000 years. During the same period, about five to seven earthquakes of magnitude 8 or greater should occur along the San Andreas Fault, while about 50 magnitude 9 <b>events</b> <b>may</b> be expected worldwide. Mauna Loa should experience about 200 eruptions over the next 1,000 years, and the Old Faithful Geyser will likely cease to operate. The Niagara Falls {{will continue to}} retreat upstream, reaching Buffalo in about 30,00050,000 years.|$|E

In addition, traditional and popular sports throughout the Americas {{which are not}} contested at the Olympic Games are also contested such as bowling and baseball. As of 2015, the Pan American Games included 36 sports with 51 disciplines and 364 events. The number and kinds of <b>events</b> <b>may</b> change slightly from one Pan American Games to another.|$|E

5|$|The {{procedure}} is high risk as a diver suffering from DCS may become paralysed, unconscious or stop breathing whilst under water. Any {{one of these}} <b>events</b> <b>may</b> result in the diver drowning or further injury to the diver during a subsequent rescue to the surface. These risks can be mitigated to some extent by using a helmet or full-face mask with voice communications on the diver, and suspending the diver from the surface so that depth is positively controlled, and by having an in-water standby diver attend the diver undergoing the treatment at all times.|$|E
5|$|Though the extinctions {{occurred}} {{at the same time}} as the Chicxulub asteroid impact strongly supports the impact hypothesis of extinction, some scientists continue to dispute the role of the Chicxulub impact in driving the extinction, and suggest that other <b>events</b> <b>may</b> have contributed to the end-Cretaceous mass extinction. In particular, volcanic eruptions, climate change, sea level change, and other impact events have been suggested to play a role in driving the K–Pg extinction.|$|E
5|$|While {{it may be}} {{uncertain}} when cultivation began it {{is still}} {{considered one of the}} oldest domesticated crops. Remains of charred cowpeas from rock shelters in Central Ghana have been dated to the second millennium BCE. In 2300 BC the cowpea is believed to have made its way into South East Asia where secondary domestication <b>events</b> <b>may</b> have occurred. From there they traveled north to the Mediterranean, where they were used by the Greeks and Romans. The first written references to the cowpea were in 300 BC and they probably reached Central and North America during the slave trade through the 17th to early 19th centuries.|$|E

5|$|Folding@home is {{assisting}} in research towards preventing some viruses, such as influenza and HIV, from recognizing and entering biological cells. In 2011, Folding@home began simulations {{of the dynamics}} of the enzyme RNase H, a key component of HIV, to try to design drugs to deactivate it. Folding@home has also been used to study membrane fusion, an essential event for viral infection and a wide range of biological functions. This fusion involves conformational changes of viral fusion proteins and protein docking, but the exact molecular mechanisms behind fusion remain largely unknown. Fusion <b>events</b> <b>may</b> consist of over a half million atoms interacting for hundreds of microseconds. This complexity limits typical computer simulations to about ten thousand atoms over tens of nanoseconds: a difference of several orders of magnitude. The development of models to predict the mechanisms of membrane fusion will assist in the scientific understanding of how to target the process with antiviral drugs. In 2006, scientists applied Markov state models and the Folding@home network to discover two pathways for fusion and gain other mechanistic insights.|$|E
5|$|Investors on Wall Street {{were putting}} their money into Marconi's system {{and some in}} the press began turning against Tesla's project, {{claiming}} it was a hoax, AuthorHouse, page 35 The project {{came to a halt}} in 1905 and in 1906, the financial problems and other <b>events</b> <b>may</b> have led to what Tesla biographer Marc J. Seifer suspects was a nervous breakdown on Tesla's part. Tesla mortgaged the Wardenclyffe property to cover his debts at the Waldorf-Astoria, which eventually mounted to $20,000 ($ in today's dollars). He lost the property in foreclosure in 1915 and in 1917 the Tower was demolished by the new owner to make the land a more viable real estate asset.|$|E
5|$|Resident Evil 6 allows {{players to}} select between four {{scenarios}} with interwoven storylines. Each scenario follows {{one of four}} main protagonists: Leon S. Kennedy, Chris Redfield, Jake Muller and Ada Wong. The player-characters from each scenario will have their own partners whom are controlled by either artificial intelligence (AI) or another player via local or online multiplayer. In addition, each scenario features a different play-style; for example, some player-characters are more vulnerable to attacks whereas others are more resilient. Each central character has unique abilities, which vary from increased reload times and carrying more ammunition. Resident Evil 6 presents new innovations and gameplay mechanics such as rolling in any direction and running whilst shooting and sliding. The game also features a four-player co-operative mode. When playing in single player mode, the player can allow another player to join in online at any time. While performing certain actions, quick time <b>events</b> <b>may</b> occur, in which the player must follow onscreen prompts by pressing buttons or manipulating joysticks within {{a limited amount of}} time.|$|E

5|$|The game {{features}} {{about fifty}} 18th-century factions; however, only eleven {{of the most}} powerful and influential are playable. In western Europe, these are Great Britain, France, the United Dutch Provinces, Spain and Sweden, and in central and eastern Europe, Prussia, Austria, Russia and Poland–Lithuania. In the Balkans and Middle East, the Ottoman Empire is the principal faction, while the Maratha Confederacy and Mughal Empire are the major powers on the Indian subcontinent. The New World colonies of the major powers are represented as protectorates of their home nation. The establishment of new nations during the era, such as Revolutionary France and the United States, and the fall of native states to the larger empires, is reflected in the game, although these major <b>events</b> <b>may</b> be averted by player actions. Smaller factions, such as the German and Italian states, Native American tribes, and North African countries, are also represented.|$|E
5|$|There are {{multiple}} scenarios for known risks {{that can have}} a global impact on the planet. From the perspective of humanity, these can be subdivided into survivable risks and terminal risks. Risks that humanity pose to itself include climate change, the misuse of nanotechnology, a nuclear holocaust, warfare with a programmed superintelligence, a genetically engineered disease, or a disaster caused by a physics experiment. Similarly, several natural <b>events</b> <b>may</b> pose a doomsday threat, including a highly virulent disease, the impact of an asteroid or comet, runaway greenhouse effect, and resource depletion. There {{may also be the}} possibility of an infestation by an extraterrestrial lifeform. The actual odds of these scenarios are difficult if not impossible to deduce.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} usually require {{very warm}} water to depth, generally above 26.5°C (80°F) extending {{to a depth}} of 50meters (160ft). However, the waters off California are cold even in summer. They rarely rise above 24°C (75°F) in near-shore southern California, and usually remain below 17°C (63°F) along {{most of the rest of}} the coast and outer coastal waters, although El Niño <b>events</b> <b>may</b> warm the waters somewhat. This is due primarily to the extensive upwelling of colder sub-surface waters caused by the prevailing northwesterly winds acting through the Ekman Effect. The winds drive surface water to the right of the wind flow, that is offshore, which draws water up from below to replace it. The upwelling further cools the already cool California Current which runs north to south along coastal California and even much of coastal Baja California. This is the same mechanism which produces coastal California's characteristic fog.|$|E
