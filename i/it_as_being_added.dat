5000|$|There {{are several}} {{phenomena}} that are confusing {{when considering the}} sequence of events in constructing this book.

It is even reasonable to consider the addendum <b>as</b> <b>being</b> <b>added</b> <b>as</b> an afterthought, following the second version of Matthew's manuscript. This is suggested by the colophon in that third instalment which mentions the material that was included to date. Additionally, the new material is not integral to the appendix that precedes it, nor does it merge with the appendix where it appears in the Contents. All this points towards the vital exposition of positive natural selection <b>being</b> <b>added</b> along with the errata, as an afterthought, and almost not making it into the book! ...|$|R
