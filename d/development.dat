40|$|Public housing {{has long}} been a {{contentious}} issue for cities and regions. While there is a great need for affordable housing in many communities, neighbors of low-income housing <b>developments</b> fret about neighborhood decay. This paper evaluates the notion that low-income housing <b>developments</b> damage the communities in which they are placed. The focus is on the evaluation of low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) financed <b>developments,</b> and the neighborhood indicator of interest is the physical condition of nearby properties. The results of the empirical analysis suggest that proximity to LIHTC <b>developments</b> generally has a positive impact on neighborhood property conditions. However, extended analysis that separates LIHTC <b>developments</b> by type and size suggests that only small new construction <b>developments</b> and large rehab <b>developments</b> impact neighborhood property conditions. Further analysis reveals that when the model does not control for crime, the effect of proximity to LIHTC <b>developments</b> on property conditions is negative. ...|$|R
