Commercial rearings of crickets in Europe are frequently decimated by this pathogen. Mortality was predominant {{in the last}} larval stage and young adults. Infected A. domesticus were smaller, less active, did not jump as high, and the adult females seldom lived more than 10 - 14 days. The most obvious pathological change was the completely empty digestive caecae. Infected tissues included adipose tissue, midgut, epidermis, and Malpighian tubules. Sudden AdDNV epizootics have decimated commercial mass rearings in widely separated parts of North America since the autumn of 2009. Facilities that are producing disease-free crickets have avoided the importation of crickets and other non-cricket species (or nonliving material). Five isolates from different areas in North America contained identical sequences as did AdDNV present in non-cricket species collected from these facilities. The North American AdDNVs differed slightly from sequences of European AdDNV isolates obtained in 1977, 2004, 2006, 2007 and 2009 and an American isolate from 1988. The substitution rate of the 1977 AdDNV 5 kb genome was about two nucleotides per year, {{about half of the}} substitutions being synonymous. The American and European AdDNV strains are estimated to have diverged in 2006. The lepidopterans Spodoptera littoralis and Galleria mellonella could not be infected with AdDNV. The Jamaican cricket, Gryllus assimilis, and the <b>European</b> <b>field</b> <b>cricket,</b> Gryllus bimaculatus, were also found to be resistant to AdDNV...|$|E
40|$|Because of call {{frequency}} overlap and masking interference, the airborne sound channel represents a limited resource for communication in a species-rich cricket community like the tropical rainforest. Here we studied the frequency tuning of an auditory neuron mediating phonotaxis in the rainforest cricket Paroecanthus podagrosus, suffering from strong competition, {{in comparison with}} the same homologous neuron in two species of <b>European</b> <b>field</b> <b>crickets,</b> where such competition does not exist. As predicted, the rainforest species exhibited a more selective tuning compared with the European counterparts. The filter reduced background nocturnal noise levels by 26 dB, compared with only 16 and 10 dB in the two European species. We also quantified the performance of the sensory filter under the different filter regimes by examining the representation of the species-specific amplitude modulation of the male calling song, when embedded in background noise. Again, the filter of the rainforest cricket performed significantly better in terms of representing this important signal parameter. The neuronal representation of the calling song pattern within receivers was maintained {{for a wide range of}} signal-to-noise ratios because of the more sharply tuned sensory system and selective attention mechanisms. Finally, the rainforest cricket also showed an almost perfect match between the filter for sensitivity and the peripheral filter for directional hearing, in contrast to its European counterparts. We discuss the consequences of these adaptations for intraspecific acoustic communication and reproductive isolation between species...|$|R

50|$|Gryllus veletis, {{commonly}} known as the spring <b>field</b> <b>cricket,</b> is abundant throughout eastern North America. G. veletis is a solitary, aggressive, omnivorous, burrow-inhabiting species of <b>field</b> <b>cricket.</b> This species is commonly confused with Gryllus pennsylvanicus (fall <b>field</b> <b>cricket),</b> as they inhabit the same geographical area. However, the two species are easily distinguished through examination of life history, ovipositor and behavioural differences. Predators of G. veletis, and most <b>field</b> <b>crickets,</b> include American toads, wild turkeys, red-tailed hawks, wolf spiders and red-backed salamanders.|$|R

50|$|The {{chirping}} of {{the more}} common <b>field</b> <b>crickets</b> is not as reliably correlated to temperature—their chirping rate varies depending on other factors such as age and mating success.

5000|$|Unlike house <b>crickets</b> (Acheta domesticus), <b>field</b> <b>crickets</b> are {{not able}} to adapt to a {{residential}} environment due to constraints in their life history traits and consequently, the insect will not live through the winter. Though <b>field</b> <b>crickets</b> are not normally found in home environments, they may invade a home to seek refuge from poor weather, attraction to light, or in search of foodstuffs (i.e. grains, seeds, etc.). Entrance can be gained through small cracks and crevices leading into a building. Once inside, damage to nylon, wool, plastic and leather fabrics may occur. The <b>field</b> <b>cricket</b> does not consume these materials, but [...] "cuts out" [...] a path through which it may pass. The human inhabitant may be aggravated by the <b>field</b> <b>cricket's</b> nocturnal chirping.|$|R

50|$|<b>Field</b> <b>crickets,</b> {{including}} G.veletis, {{are generally}} omnivorous scavengers. Their diet normally consists of plants, both fresh and decaying, other dead insects {{and in some}} cases predation of other <b>field</b> <b>crickets</b> or live insects may occur. An example of <b>field</b> <b>cricket</b> predation is seen in the consumption of fly pupae, which helps reduce the population of flies, often viewed as pests by humans. Consumption of plant matter helps ensure that fallen leaves and other material does not accumulate. Along with other scavengers (i.e. earthworm, beetles, etc.) decomposition of plants into fertile soil helps maintain a balanced ecosystem in forests and fields.|$|R

40|$|Animal {{personality}} can {{be defined}} as a set of physiological and behavioral characteristics that differ between individuals, but are consistent over time and across situations. The evolution of individual differences in behavior that are consistent over time and situations is still not clear. Our understanding of why animals have personality can be improved by investigating the underlying physiological mechanisms of animal behavior. Serotonin is a key monoamine that serves as a physiological modulator of animal behavior. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are a group of chemicals that increase levels of serotonin in the brain. Fluoxetine is one such chemical and is used to treat depression in humans. In the <b>field</b> <b>cricket</b> (Gryllus bimaculatus), increased levels of serotonin have been linked to higher activity and boldness, which are both personality traits. In the current study, the effects of induced serotonin on activity, exploration, boldness and aggression was investigated. My results show that injecting fluoxetine causes substantial changes in behavioral traits used to describe personality in <b>field</b> <b>crickets.</b> This result is opposite to previous studies, as serotonin induced individuals were less active, less explorative, and won less fights, compared to control individuals. This could be due to serotonin existing naturally within the circulatory system of the <b>field</b> <b>cricket,</b> whereas fluoxetine is a manufactured chemical intended for human receptors, or that fluoxetine has a similar effect in modulating personality in <b>field</b> <b>crickets</b> as in humans. Since fluoxetine acts similarly in <b>field</b> <b>crickets</b> as in humans, an increased understanding of the effects of induced serotonin on different behaviors in <b>field</b> <b>crickets</b> could be beneficial for treating psychological illnesses...|$|R
