40|$|Properties of cellobiose:quinone {{oxidoreductase}} (CBQ), cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH), glyoxal <b>oxidase</b> (GLOX), <b>glucose</b> <b>oxidases</b> and veratryl {{alcohol oxidase}} (VAO) are reviewed. There is {{strong evidence that}} CDH reduces quinones, phenoxy and cation radicals. <b>Glucose</b> <b>oxidases</b> (<b>glucose</b> 1 -oxidase and pyranose 2 -oxidase) and VAO have been less investigated but evidence for reduction of the above compounds is accumulating. Pyranose oxidase, glyoxal oxidase and VAO are very important for hydrogen peroxide production by white-rot fungi. CDH is only produced on cellulose or on wood, whereas pyranose oxidase and VAO are produced both on wood and on rich glucose media suggesting that the lignin degrading white-rot fungi may use different quinone and radical reducing enzymes to regulate lignin polymerization/depolymerization depending on the substrate and cultivation conditions. Intracellular quinone reductases are also produced. Whether brown-rot fungi in general produce CBQ/CDH or VAO is not clear. The Fe(III) reducing ability of both CDH and certain phenolate compounds agree with the rapid depolymerization of cellulose by brown-rot fungi. The interaction of Fe(III) reduction with the hydrogen peroxide producing system in white-rot and brown-rot fungi requires more investigation. © 1997 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|R

GOX exists as a homodimer, with each subunit binding one FAD molecule. Crystal structures show that FAD binds {{in a deep}} pocket of the enzyme near the dimer interface. Studies showed that upon replacement of FAD with 8-hydroxy-5-carba-5-deaza FAD, the stereochemistry of the reaction was determined by reacting with the re face of the flavin.

The ADP-binding site and the signature 1 and 2 consensus sequences of glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductases are present in PEGDH.

The catalytically important active sites were assigned to His- 467 and Asn- 511. One disulfide bridge between Cys- 379 and Cys- 382 existed in PEGDH and seemed to play roles in both substrate binding and electron mediation. The Cys- 297 mutant showed decreased activity, suggesting the residue's importance in both substrate binding and electron mediation, as well as Cys- 379 and Cys- 382. PEGDH also contains a motif of a ubiquinone-binding site, and coenzyme Q 10 was utilized as an electron acceptor.

Highly ordered titania nanotube array with inner diameter of 60 nm and total length of 540 nm was formed by anodizing titanium foils. The functionalization modification was achieved by embedding <b>glucose</b> <b>oxidases</b> inside tubule channels and electropolymerizing pyrrole for interfacial immobilization.

A biosensor based on the glucose oxidase-titania/titanium electrode was constructed for amperometric detection and quantitative determination of glucose in a phosphate buffer solution (pH 6. 8) under a potentiostatic condition (- 0. 4 V versus SCE). The resulting glucose biosensor showed an excellent performance with a response time below 5. 6 s and a detection limit of 2. 0 × 10 - 3 mM.

30|$|In the {{previous}} studies about assisted thrombolysis, the researchers {{had used a}} variety of methods to try to carry the encapsuled drugs to reach the thrombus site, such as liposomes and magnetic nanoparticles (NPs). But as described in some reports, the use of liposomes was limited by poor repeatability and low encapsulation efficiency and enzyme inactivity, while magnetic NPs was limited by sizes and complicated controllability [28 – 30]. In this work, we used F 0 F 1 -ATPase as a mechanical rotation motor. We separated all the subunits from it first, then reassembled and optimized, and obtained a new relatively complicated nanomachine at last. Under the condition of light driving, the new nanomachine can produce proton gradient, which provides energy for the nanomachine, and makes it rotate smoothly and easily without the limitation of the δ-subunit. Although the assembled process of the δ-subunit-free F 0 F 1 -ATPase is relatively complicated, it has good repeatability, stability, and activity according to our previous studies [14, 15, 22]. However, the proton gradient formed by the light driving may be not the only selection. Li et al. entrapped <b>glucose</b> <b>oxidases</b> (GODs) into the cavity of polymeric hollow spheres of biomimetic nanocapsules, which can hydrolyze glucose in the suspension and produce proton gradient, thus supply power for ATPase.

The recent study of the [i]Pycnoporus cinnabarinus[/i] CIRM BRFM 137 genome combined with its secretome revealed that four AA 3 _ 2 enzymes are secreted during biomass degradation. One of these AA 3 _ 2 enzymes, scf 184803. g 17, has recently been produced heterologously in [i]Aspergillus niger[/i]. Based on the enzyme's activity and specificity, it was assigned to the glucose dehydrogenases ([i]P. cinnabarinus[/i] GDH [PcGDH]).

These proteins showed the highest homology with aryl alcohol oxidase from [i]Pleurotus eryngii[/i]. Biochemical characterization demonstrated that they were also flavoenzymes harboring flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) as a cofactor and able to oxidize a wide variety of phenolic and nonphenolic aryl alcohols and one aliphatic polyunsaturated primary alcohol. Though presenting homology with fungal AAOs, these enzymes exhibited greater efficiency in reducing electron acceptors (quinones and one artificial acceptor) than molecular oxygen and so were defined as aryl-alcohol:quinone oxidoreductases (AAQOs) with two enzymes possessing residual oxidase activity (PcAAQO 2 and PcAAQO 3). Structural comparison of PcAAQO homology models with P. eryngii AAO demonstrated a wider substrate access channel connecting the active-site cavity to the solvent, explaining the absence of activity with molecular oxygen. Finally, the ability of PcAAQOs to reduce radical intermediates generated by laccase from P. cinnabarinus was demonstrated, shedding light on the ligninolytic system of this fungus...|$|R

30|$|In our {{previous}} study, a biosynthetic pathway to an antibiotic nectrisine in T. discophora was proposed via d-xylulose 5 -phosphate and 4 -amino- 4 -deoxyarabinitol, {{and it was}} found that the crude enzyme converted 4 -amino- 4 -deoxyarabinitol to nectrisine (Miyauchi et al. 2015). In the current study, we aimed to characterize the enzyme responsible for the conversion of 4 -amino- 4 -deoxyarabinitol to nectrisine. A novel oxidase, NecC, was first purified and showed characteristics of an FAD-dependent GMC oxidoreductase family. Ammonium sulfate fractionation was effective for the enzyme purification and excellent recovery of the enzyme activity. Subsequent anion exchange chromatography increased the protein purity of NecC based on SDS–PAGE analysis, however, slightly decreased its specific activity. This may have been caused by the partial release of its cofactor at the chromatography step. Washing the column to which the enzyme bound could have resulted in the partial release of the cofactor from the enzyme since the cofactor was indicated to be non-covalently bound to the enzyme (Fig.  4). In general, GMC oxidoreductases form oligomers, such as <b>glucose</b> <b>oxidases</b> of homodimer (Frederick et al. 1990; Kiess et al. 1998), alcohol oxidases of eight identical subunits (Kato et al. 1976; Vonck and van Bruggen 1990; Boteva et al. 1999; Soldevila et al. 2000; Ozimek et al. 2005), and pyranose oxidases of four identical subunits (Giffhorn 2000; Wongnate and Chaiyen 2013). These reports suggested that these oxidases under native conditions were virtually uniform in size. However, several size variants were detected of NecC produced by T. discophora under native conditions. On the other hand, under denaturing conditions, NecC showed double bands at around 60  kDa in SDS–PAGE. This was probably due to partial glycosylation which is known to migrate bands and affect molecular weight determinations in SDS–PAGE (Segrest and Jackson 1972), since potential N-glycosylation sites were found in the sequence. Moreover, bacterially expressed NecC had the activity and exhibited a single band in SDS–PAGE (data not shown) which indicated that NecC protein could be derived from the homogeneous sequence. Therefore, the oligomer of NecC could be composed of identical subunits in terms of the amino acid sequence.|$|R

The high-dose infusion test showed no differences between the anomers of either blood glucose or serum insulin levels. However, at the lower dose, the alpha-glucose anomer stimulated a significantly greater insulin release than did beta-glucose. It is concluded that the alpha-glucose anomer stimulates a greater insulin release than the beta-glucose anomer in human subjects at low but not at high doses intravenously and that this response is not apparently related to approximations {{of the degree of}} mutarotation. These results suggest that a steric specific glucose receptor site exists on the beta-cell as a rapid insulin release trigger, although the alpha-anomer does not exclusively produce this stimulation...|$|R
