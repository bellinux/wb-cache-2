25|$|Honorific {{speech is}} a type of social <b>deixis,</b> as an {{understanding}} of the context—in this case, the social status of the speaker relative to the other participants or bystanders—is crucial to its use.|$|E
25|$|Malagasy has {{a complex}} system of <b>deixis</b> (these, those, here, there, etc.), with seven degrees of {{distance}} {{as well as}} evidentiality across all seven. The evidential dimension is prototypically visible vs. non-visible referents; however, the non-visible forms {{may be used for}} visible referents which are only vaguely identified or have unclear boundaries, whereas the visible forms are used for non-visible referents when these are topical to the conversation.|$|E
500|$|The {{semantic}} {{study of}} meaning assumes that meaning {{is located in}} a relation between signs and meanings that are firmly established through social convention. However, semantics does not study the way in which social conventions are made and affect language. Rather, when studying the way in which words and signs are used, it is often the case that words have different meanings, depending on the social context of use. An important example of this is the process called <b>deixis,</b> which describes the way in which certain words refer to entities through their relation between a specific point in time and space when the word is uttered. Such words are, for example, the word, [...] "I" [...] (which designates the person speaking), [...] "now" [...] (which designates the moment of speaking), and [...] "here" [...] (which designates the position of speaking). Signs also change their meanings over time, as the conventions governing their usage gradually change. The study of how the meaning of linguistic expressions changes depending on context is called pragmatics. <b>Deixis</b> {{is an important part of}} the way that we use language to point out entities in the world. Pragmatics is concerned with the ways in which language use is patterned and how these patterns contribute to meaning. For example, in all languages, linguistic expressions can be used not just to transmit information, but to perform actions. Certain actions are made only through language, but nonetheless have tangible effects, e.g. the act of [...] "naming", which creates a new name for some entity, or the act of [...] "pronouncing someone man and wife", which creates a social contract of marriage. These types of acts are called speech acts, although they can of course also be carried out through writing or hand signing.|$|E
500|$|However, many {{languages}} {{also have}} grammatical conventions that signal the social {{position of the}} speaker in relation to others {{through the use of}} registers that are related to social hierarchies or divisions. In many languages, there are stylistic or even grammatical differences between the ways men and women speak, between age groups, or between social classes, just as some languages employ different words depending on who is listening. For example, in the Australian language Dyirbal, a married man must use a special set of words to refer to everyday items when speaking in the presence of his mother-in-law. Some cultures, for example, have elaborate systems of [...] "social deixis", or systems of signalling social distance through linguistic means. In English, social <b>deixis</b> is shown mostly through distinguishing between addressing some people by first name and others by surname, and in titles such as [...] "Mrs.", [...] "boy", [...] "Doctor", or [...] "Your Honor", but in other languages, such systems may be highly complex and codified in the entire grammar and vocabulary of the language. For instance, in languages of east Asia such as Thai, Burmese, and Javanese, different words are used according to whether a speaker is addressing someone of higher or lower rank than oneself in a ranking system with animals and children ranking the lowest and gods and members of royalty as the highest.|$|E
2500|$|Klingon nouns take suffixes to {{indicate}} grammatical number. There are three noun classes, {{two levels of}} <b>deixis,</b> and a possession and syntactic function. In all, twenty-nine noun suffixes from five classes may be employed: jupoypu’na’wI’vaD [...] "for my beloved true friends". A word may carry {{no more than one}} suffix from each class, and the classes have a specific order of appearance.|$|E
2500|$|Communication in niches such as {{role-playing}} games (RPG) of Multi-User domains (MUDs) {{and virtual}} worlds is highly interactive, {{with emphasis on}} speed, brevity and spontaneity. [...] As a result, CMC is generally more vibrant, volatile, unstructured and open. There are often complex organization of sequences and exchange structures evident in the connection of conversational strands and short turns. Some of the CMC strategies used include capitalization for words such as EMPHASIS, usage of symbols such as the asterisk to enclose words as seen in *stress* and the creative use of punctuation like ???!?!?!?. Symbols are also used for discourse functions, such as the asterisk as a conversational repair marker and arrows and carats as <b>deixis</b> and referent markers. Besides contributing to these new forms in language, virtual worlds are also being used to teach languages. Virtual world language learning provides students with simulations of real-life environments, allowing them to find creative ways to improve their language skills. Virtual worlds are good tools for language learning among the younger learners because they already see such places as a [...] "natural place to learn and play".|$|E
2500|$|Despite this, on most simple test {{questions}} such as [...] "Who is the girl pulling?" [...] or [...] "What is the red box on?" [...] Genie did not react or reply to test questions at all. When she did respond she clearly had no understanding of the sentence and gave completely ungrammatical and nonsensical answers, either stating the answer in the question, attempting to fuse two separate questions into one, or attempting to state a declarative sentence as a question. She also remained entirely unable to ask an interrogative question in conversation, only ever attempting to upon specific request, and efforts during mid-1973 to help her memorize interrogative questions were completely unsuccessful. Curtiss theorized this inability was because Genie had no <b>deixis</b> or linguistic movement in her speech, and in 1975 the scientists speculated emotional difficulties may have made her unwilling to attempt them in spontaneous speech. Curtiss attributed Genie's failure to memorize them to being generally unable to remember sentences using grammar she had not mastered, which is typical of young children. After seeing how much trouble the tests gave Genie Curtiss ended them, and after approximately a year people stopped asking her to produce these questions.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{language}} {{versions of}} Jacques Brel songs {{have been recorded}} by {{a wide variety of}} artists throughout the world. The most frequently recorded song in other languages is [...] "Ne me quitte pas" [...] (Don't leave me), with at least 400 different recorded versions in 22 different languages. Most English versions use the freely translated [...] "If You Go Away" [...] by Rod McKuen, sung by Frank Sinatra and Barbra Streisand. Marlene Dietrich recorded the German version [...] "Bitte geh' nicht fort" [...] in 1963. Paris-based Colombian salsa singer Yuri Buenaventura performed the Spanish version, [...] "No me dejes mas". Slovak chanteuse Hana Hegerová made the Czech version [...] "Lásko prokletá" [...] one of the pillars of her repertoire. Russian rock group Mumiy Troll recorded the Russian version, [...] "Когда ты уйдёшь". Slovenian actor and songwriter Jure Ivanušič released the CD [...] "Srce v kovčku" [...] with his 16 authorial translations of Brel's songs into Slovenian in 2011. Armenian poet Slavik Chiloyan, who met Brel in Yerevan in 1968, translated a number of Brel's songs into Armenian. In 1968 singer Salome recorded the Catalan version [...] "No em <b>deixis</b> mai". In 1970 Patty Pravo published the Italian version, [...] "Non andare via", as a single, Gino Paoli had published the same version in 1962 as the B side of his [...] "Devi sapere" [...] single.|$|E
2500|$|The {{difference}} between languages does not consist only in differences in pronunciation, vocabulary or grammar, {{but also in}} different [...] "cultures of speaking". Some cultures for example have elaborate systems of [...] "social deixis", systems of signalling social distance through linguistic means. In English, social <b>deixis</b> is shown mostly though distinguishing between addressing some people by first name and others by surname, but also in titles such as [...] "Mrs.", [...] "boy", [...] "Doctor" [...] or [...] "Your Honor", but in other languages such systems may be highly complex and codified in the entire grammar and vocabulary of the language. In several languages of east Asia, for example Thai, Burmese and Javanese, different words are used according to whether a speaker is addressing someone of higher or lower rank than oneself in a ranking system with animals and children ranking the lowest and gods and members of royalty as the highest. Other languages may use different forms of address when speaking to speakers of the opposite gender or in-law relatives and many languages have special ways of speaking to infants and children. Among other groups, the culture of speaking may entail not speaking to particular people, for example many indigenous cultures of Australia have a taboo against talking to one's in-law relatives, and in some cultures speech is not addressed directly to children. Some languages also require different ways of speaking for different social classes of speakers, and often such a system is based on gender differences, as in Japanese and Koasati.|$|E

50|$|Possibly {{the most}} common {{categories}} of contextual information referred to by <b>deixis</b> are those of person, place, and time - what Fillmore calls the “major grammaticalized types” of <b>deixis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Place <b>deixis,</b> {{also known}} as space <b>deixis,</b> {{concerns}} itself with the spatial locations relevant to an utterance. Similarly to person <b>deixis,</b> the locations may be either those of the speaker and addressee or those of persons or objects being referred to. The most salient English examples are the adverbs “here” and “there” and the demonstratives “this” and “that” - although those are {{far from being the}} only deictic words.|$|E
50|$|The terms <b>deixis</b> and indexicality are {{frequently}} used almost interchangeably, and both deal with {{essentially the same}} idea: contextually dependent references.

5000|$|The term “deixis” {{refers to}} the ways in which {{language}} encodes contextual information into its grammatical system. More broadly, <b>deixis</b> {{refers to the}} inherent ambiguity of certain linguistic expressions and the interpretive processes that communicants must perform in order to disambiguate these words and phrases. Such ambiguity can only be resolved by analyzing the context in which the utterance occurs.  To understand <b>deixis,</b> one must first understand that language grammaticalizes context-dependent features such as person, space, and time. When language is oriented toward its context, certain expressions in speech emerge that differentiate the “here” and “now” (proximal <b>deixis)</b> from the “then” and “there” (distal <b>deixis).</b> According to Karl Buhler, an Austrian psychologist who was one of the earliest to present a theory of <b>deixis,</b> “When philosophers, linguists, and narrative theorists attempt to understand the role of subjectivity in language and conversely, the role of language in subjectivity, they invariably notice a certain aspect of language which seems to depend on extralinguistic, subjective, occasion-specific considerations.” Within the context of narrative, <b>deixis</b> reflects those aspects of storytelling by which the audience is pragmatically directed to understand the perspective of the narrator or the perspective of the story’s characters in relation to their own story-external vantage point. Essentially, deictic expressions help form the layers of narrative that direct the audience to either the narratorial discourse or to the story world. “Deixis (adjectival form, deictic) is a psycholinguistic term for those aspects of meaning associated with self-world orientation”. [...] <b>Deixis</b> is an integral component of the lens by which the audience perceives the narrative.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} degrees of <b>deixis,</b> here/this, there/that, yonder/yon.|$|E
5000|$|Bernard Comrie classifies the pluperfect as an absolute-relative tense, {{because it}} {{absolutely}} (not by context) establishes a <b>deixis</b> (the past event) and places the action {{relative to the}} <b>deixis</b> (before it).Examples of the English pluperfect (past perfect) {{are found in the}} following sentence (from Viktor Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning): ...|$|E
5000|$|In linguistics, <b>deixis</b> (...) {{refers to}} words and phrases, such as “me” or “here”, that cannot be fully {{understood}} without additional contextual information -- in this case, {{the identity of}} the speaker (“me”) and the speaker's location (“here”). Words are deictic if their semantic meaning is fixed but their denotational meaning varies depending on time and/or place. Words or phrases that require contextual information to convey any meaning - for example, English pronouns - are deictic. <b>Deixis</b> is closely related to anaphora, as will be further explained below. Although this article deals primarily with <b>deixis</b> in spoken language, the concept is sometimes applied to written language, gestures, and communication media as well. In linguistic anthropology, <b>deixis</b> is treated as a particular subclass of the more general semiotic phenomenon of indexicality, a sign [...] "pointing to" [...] some aspect of its context of occurrence.|$|E
