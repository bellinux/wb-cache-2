5|$|Nanda and Hiranandani {{proved to}} be {{instrumental}} in taking Vikrant to war. There were objections that the ship might have severe operational difficulties that would expose the carrier to <b>increased</b> <b>danger</b> on operations. In addition, the three s acquired by the Pakistan Navy posed a significant risk to the carrier. In June, extensive deep sea trials were carried out, with steel safety harnesses around the three boilers still operational. Observation windows were fitted as a precautionary measure, to detect any steam leaks. By the end of June, the trials were complete and Vikrant was cleared to participate on operations, with its speed restricted to 14 knots.|$|E
5|$|The Americans {{continued}} to receive armaments from Ticonderoga, with guns arriving on September 21 {{and also on}} October 5. However, the artillery were positioned {{too far away to}} do much damage to the fort. With the arrival of the new guns, Montgomery planned to move the emphasis of the bombardment from {{the east side of the}} fort to the north side, where they would be closer. However, his officers unanimously rejected this plan, fearing that many men would desert due to the <b>increased</b> <b>danger.</b> Montgomery ordered that a new battery be built where the Royal Savage could be threatened. On October 14, the battery was completed and then used to sink the British ship.|$|E

25|$|A. ocellaris feed on {{plankton}} and algae, {{thus they}} are considered omnivores. Feeding is also affected by the hierarchy in A. ocellaris groups. Since the smaller, less dominant fish face aggression from the more aggressive fish, they have less energy to forage for food. Thus, they usually do not eat {{as much as the}} dominant fish do, because of reduced energy, but also because of the <b>increased</b> <b>danger</b> they face when they leave their anemone since they are smaller. In other words, the larger fish will usually travel farther than the smaller fish. Generally, the A. ocellaris feed on algae, copepods, and zooplankton.|$|E
25|$|When {{the reading}} {{audience}} of superhero comic books became predominately young {{boys in the}} mid to late 1950s, the focus of Superman stories shifted toward science fiction inspired plots involving extraterrestrials, fantasy creatures, and bizarre plots. Lois' main interests in various late 1950s and 1960s stories became vying with her rival Lana Lang for Superman's affections, attempting to prove Clark Kent and Superman were one and the same or otherwise getting Superman into marriage. Superman's rationale for resisting her matrimonial desires was that marrying her would put her in <b>increased</b> <b>danger</b> from his enemies and that she could not keep his secret identity hidden. Regardless, Lois married several times in the Superman stories of this era, including to Superman imposter from Kandor, the villainous Zak-Kul and a man from the future. All these marriages were either annulled or otherwise forgotten.|$|E
25|$|The general {{short-term}} {{effect of}} nitrogen fertilization on coniferous seedlings is to stimulate shoot growth {{more so than}} root growth (Armson and Carman 1961). Over a longer period, root growth is also stimulated. Many nursery managers were long reluctant to apply nitrogenous fertilizers late in the growing season, for fear of <b>increased</b> <b>danger</b> of frost damage to succulent tissues. A presentation at the North American Forest Tree Nursery Soils Workshop at Syracuse in 1980 provided strong contrary evidence: Bob Eastman, President of the Western Maine Forest Nursery Co. stated that for 15 years he {{has been successful in}} avoiding winter “burn” to Norway spruce and white spruce in his nursery operation by fertilizing with 50-80lb/ac (56–90kg/ha) nitrogen in September, whereas previously winter burn had been experienced annually, often severely. Eastman also stated that the overwintering storage capacity of stock thus treated was much improved (Eastman 1980).|$|E

500|$|The rammerman's {{position}} was of special concern, as ramming {{was considered the}} most dangerous part of loading the gun. The ram was used to first thrust the projectile and then the powder bags into the gun's breech. The ram speed used for the projectile was much faster ( [...] per second) than that used for the lighter powder bags ( [...] per second), {{but there was no}} safety device on the ram piston to prevent the rammerman from accidentally pushing the powder bags at the faster speed. Overramming the powder bags into the gun could subject the highly flammable powder to excessive friction and compression, with a resulting <b>increased</b> <b>danger</b> of premature combustion. Also, if the bags were pushed too far into the gun, a gap between the last bag and the primer might prevent the powder from igniting when the gun was fired, causing a misfire. None of Iowas rammermen had any training or experience in ramming nonstandard five-bag loads into the guns. Complicating the task, as the rammerman was shoving the powder bags, he was also supposed to simultaneously operate a lever to shut the powder hoist door and lower the powder hoist car. Iowa crewmen later stated that Turret Two's center gun rammer would sometimes [...] "take off" [...] uncontrollably on its own at high speed. Furthermore, Backherms had never operated the ram before during a live fire shoot.|$|E
500|$|Rylands v Fletcher {{contained}} {{the principle that}} [...] "the person who for his own purposes brings on his lands and collects and keeps there anything likely to do mischief if it escapes, must keep it at his peril, and, {{if he does not}} do so, is prima facie answerable for all the damage which is the natural consequence of its escape", with a requirement that this use of land be [...] "non-natural". On the Cambridge Water Company's third claim, Kennedy was forced to consider the meaning of [...] "non-natural" [...] in this setting. He held that the use of industrial chemicals was not [...] "non-natural", given that it was on an industrial site, and that for a claim to succeed under Rylands the use must be [...] "some special use bringing <b>increased</b> <b>danger</b> to others, and must not merely be the ordinary use of the land or such a use as is proper for the general benefit of the community"; Eastern Counties Leather created jobs in Sawston, and was thus providing a benefit for the community. As such, the Company's claim under Rylands was not valid. Kennedy also chose to consider foreseeability of harm a factor in cases brought under Rylands, and stated the fact that harm was not foreseeable was a factor in his decision.|$|E
2500|$|The {{requirement}} of [...] "non-natural use", {{which was created}} when the case went to the House of Lords, was described by Lord Moulton, in Rickards v Lothian, as [...] "some special use bringing with it <b>increased</b> <b>danger</b> to others". Because the idea of something being [...] "non-natural" [...] is a subjective one, the interpretation of this principle has varied over the years. In Musgrove v Pandelis, a car filled with petrol was considered [...] "non-natural", while in Rainham Chemical Works Ltd v Belvedere Fish Guano Co Ltd, so was the operation of a munitions factory during war-time. There is no single concrete test to define what is [...] "non-natural", for reasons given by Lord Bingham in Transco plc v Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council; [...] " [...] is not a test to be inflexibly applied. A use may be extraordinary and unusual {{at one time or}} in one place but not so at another time or in another place...I also doubt whether a test of reasonable use is helpful, since a use may well bye quite out of the ordinary but not unreasonable".|$|E

60|$|When Miss Peyton and {{her niece}} first learned the escape of Captain Wharton, {{it was with}} {{difficulty}} they could credit their senses. They both relied so implicitly {{on the success of}} Dunwoodie's exertions, that they thought the act, on the part of their relative, extremely imprudent; but it was now too late to mend it. While listening to the conversation of the officers, both were struck with the <b>increased</b> <b>danger</b> of Henry's situation, if recaptured, and they trembled to think of the great exertions that would be made to accomplish this object. Miss Peyton consoled herself, and endeavored to cheer her niece, with the probability that the fugitives would pursue their course with unremitting diligence, so that they might reach the neutral ground before the horse would carry down the tidings of their flight. The absence of Dunwoodie seemed to her all-important, and the artless lady was anxiously devising some project that might detain her kinsman, and thus give her nephew the longest possible time. But very different were the reflections of Frances. She could no longer doubt that the figure she had seen on the hill was Birch, and she felt certain that, instead of flying to the friendly forces below, her brother would be taken to the mysterious hut to pass the night.|$|E

But although I stuck out my heels and tried to thrust the handle of my shovel into the ground, it was of no use. On we went, and the inequalities of the surface gave an irregularity of motion which was uncomfortable and alarming. We turned to this side and that, we bounced and bumped, and the rawhide ropes, which must have been greatly frayed and cut by the snow crust, now gave way in several places, and I knew that the mattress would soon separate into its original cushions, if indeed they still could be called cushions. Fearing <b>increased</b> <b>danger</b> should we now continue bound together in a bunch, I jerked apart the shawl-knot under my arms, and the next moment, it seemed to me, there was a general dissolution of our connection with each other.

I had just succeeded in stopping myself, when down upon me came the rest of the company, all prostrate in some position or other.|$|E

60|$|Most male {{birds are}} highly pugnacious during the breeding-season, and some possess weapons adapted for {{fighting}} with their rivals.

From the curiously diversified means for producing various sounds, we gain a high idea of the importance of this means of courtship. Many birds endeavour to charm the females by love- dances or antics, performed on the ground or in the air, and sometimes at prepared places. But ornaments of many kinds, the most brilliant tints, combs and wattles, beautiful plumes, elongated feathers, top-knots, and so forth, are by far the commonest means. In some cases mere novelty appears to have acted as a charm. The ornaments of the males must be highly important to them, for they have been acquired in not a few cases at the cost of <b>increased</b> <b>danger</b> from enemies, and even at some loss of power in fighting with their rivals. The males of very many species do not assume their ornamental dress until they arrive at maturity, or they assume it only during the breeding-season, or the tints then become more vivid.

As superstitious beliefs died out, people became less cautious of destroying the field monuments such as raths and stone circles, which hitherto had been avoided in cultivation of the land.
