The consumer's {{right of withdrawal}} in case of hire purchase was strengthened in March 1974, and fixed prices for branded products were abolished by law in January that same year, which meant that manufacturers' recommended prices were not binding for retailers. In addition, a progressive anticartel law was passed. A 1969 law on <b>explosive</b> <b>materials</b> was supplemented by two orders; the first (made in November 1969) establishing a committee of experts for <b>explosive</b> <b>materials,</b> while the second order (made the following month) included details {{for the implementation of}} the law on <b>explosive</b> <b>materials.</b> An Act of December 1959 on the peaceful use of nuclear energy and protection against its dangers was amended by an Act of June 1970 that established a tax levied for the costs for permissions and surveillance measures. The Law on Compensation for Measures of Criminal Prosecution and Penalties, passed in March 1971, provided for standardized compensation in certain situations. In addition, the budget for communications was increased.|$|E

The utility of gunpowder lies in its ability to accelerate a projectile by the explosive expansion of gas. The development of new <b>explosive</b> <b>materials</b> in the 19th century naturally led to improvements in the rate and magnitude of pressure rise as well as new means for ignition of the charge.|$|E

25|$|Additional {{precautions}} must {{be taken}} to prevent side-flashes between conductive objects on or in the structure and the lightning protection system. The surge of lightning current through a lightning protection conductor will create a voltage difference between it and any conductive objects that are near it. This voltage difference can be large enough to cause a dangerous side-flash (spark) between the two that can cause significant damage, especially on structures housing flammable or <b>explosive</b> <b>materials.</b> The most effective way to prevent this potential damage is to ensure the electrical continuity between the lightning protection system and any objects susceptible to a side-flash. Effective bonding will allow the voltage potential of the two objects to rise and fall simultaneously, thereby eliminating any risk of a side-flash.|$|E
25|$|Since many {{countries}} heavily restrict the civilian possession of ammunition and ammunition components, including primers and smokeless powder, handloading may be explicitly or implicitly illegal in certain countries. Even without specific restrictions on powder and primers, {{they may be}} covered under other laws governing <b>explosive</b> <b>materials.</b> Handloading may require study and passing an exam to acquire a handloading permit prior to being allowed to handload ammunition in some jurisdictions. This is done to avoid catastrophic accidents caused by lack of knowledge/skill as much as possible, and also allows the government to maintain information on who reloads their own cartridges. The standards organization C.I.P. rules that the products of handloaders that do not comply with the C.I.P. ammunition approval rules for commercial ammunition manufacturers cannot be legally sold in C.I.P. member states.|$|E

25|$|Following the oil spill, Queensland Premier Anna Bligh {{declared}} two {{islands and}} parts of the Sunshine coast as disaster areas. Cleanup efforts were reportedly going to cost at least $100,000 a day and last more than a week as the oil continued to spread. The company in charge of the cargo ship is faced with a possible $1.5million in fines for the incident. Several search parties have been sent to the spill area to attempt to find the potentially <b>explosive</b> <b>materials</b> that were in the 31 containers. Press reports stated that if the ammonium nitrate were to mix with the heavy fuel, it could ignite the ammonium nitrate and cause a large explosion. If the chemical did not react with the fuel, but still leaked out, marine life could be threatened by large blooms in algae. A team of 88 people were sent out to begin the cleanup process and another 58 were expected to join within the following days. On Moreton Island, a total of 290 people are working to clean up the oil with most of them focusing on Middle Creek and Cape Moreton. Even though hundreds of people were working on cleaning the spill, the average amount cleaned each day was 1km2 (0.6mi2). It was not until May of that year that Moreton Island was finally cleared of oil. The cleanup effort was undertaken by 2,500 people and led to the removal of roughly 3,000 tonnes of contaminated sand.|$|E
500|$|While Christmas Island was {{the main}} base, the area around Malden Island [...] to the south {{was to be the}} site for the bomber-dropped tests, and Penrhyn Island, [...] farther south was used as a {{technical}} monitoring site and as a weather station. A USAF special weapons monitoring team was based here, and the airstrip was improved to allow its supporting Douglas C-124 Globemaster II to use it. The Task Force received generous support from the United States Army, Navy and USAF. RAF aircraft were allowed to overfly the United States, even when carrying radioactive or <b>explosive</b> <b>materials,</b> thereby obviating the need for winterisation for the more northerly journey over Canada. RAF ground crews were accommodated at Hickham and Travis Air Force Base in California, and a regular aerial courier service operated from Hickham to Christmas Island. Warrior had repairs made at Pearl Harbor, and the US Army base at Fort DeRussy gave Woollett use of its facilities.|$|E

2500|$|There is {{only one}} supermax prison in the United States federal system, ADX Florence in Florence, Colorado. [...] It houses several inmates who {{have a history of}} violent {{behavior}} in other prisons, with the goal of moving them from solitary confinement for 23 hours a day to a less restrictive prison within three years. [...] However, it is best known for housing several inmates who have been deemed either too dangerous, too high-profile or too great a national security risk for even a maximum-security prison. [...] Residents include Timothy McVeigh, perpetrator of the Oklahoma City Bombing who was executed by lethal injection at the Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute on June 11, 2001; Theodore Kaczynski, a domestic terrorist otherwise known as the Unabomber, who once attacked via mail bombs; Robert Hanssen, an American FBI agent turned Soviet spy; Terry Nichols, McVeigh's accomplice in the Oklahoma City Bombing; Richard Reid, known as the [...] "Shoe Bomber", who was jailed for life for attempting to detonate <b>explosive</b> <b>materials</b> in his shoes while on board an aircraft; Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the underwear bomber; Richard Lee McNair, a persistent prison escapee; Charles Harrelson, a hitman who was convicted in 1979 of killing Federal Judge John H.

The maximum security facility in Colorado is the only federal Super Max in the United States. It is reserved for federal crimes. The Boston Marathon Bomber was housed there. Deprivation of social contact and the isolation of inmates has some unintended positive and negative effects. Inmates are safer being in isolation, and prisons create more jobs for their local communities. Super max prisons however are extremely expensive to run and can cost about three times the national average for a maximum security facility.|$|E

6000|$|Of this diseased {{epidemic}} influence {{there are}} two forms especially preclusive of tragic worth. The first is the necessary growth of a sense and love of the ludicrous, and a morbid sensibility of the assimilative power,--an inflammation produced by cold and weakness,--which in the boldest bursts of passion will lie in wait for a jeer at any phrase, that may have an accidental coincidence in the mere words with something base or trivial. For instance,--to express woods, not on a plain, but clothing a hill, which overlooks a valley, or dell, or river, or the sea,--the trees rising one above another, as the spectators in an ancient theatre,--I know no other word in our language, (bookish and pedantic terms out of the question,) but 'hanging' woods, the 'sylvæ superimpendentes' of Catullus [2]; yet let some wit call out in a slang tone,--"the gallows!" [...] and a peal of laughter would damn the play. Hence it {{is that so many}} dull pieces have had a decent run, only because nothing unusual above, or absurd below, mediocrity furnished an occasion,--a spark for the <b>explosive</b> <b>materials</b> collected behind the orchestra. But it would take a volume of no ordinary size, however laconically the sense were expressed, if it were meant to instance the effects, and unfold all the causes, of this disposition upon the moral, intellectual, and even physical character of a people, with its influences on domestic life and individual deportment. A good document upon this subject would be the history of Paris society and of French, that is, Parisian, literature from the commencement of {{the latter half of the}} reign of Louis XIV. to that of Buonaparte, compared with the preceding philosophy and poetry even of Frenchmen themselves.|$|E
