30|$|Figure 6 b {{shows the}} {{coagulation}} of Ag nanoparticles, which was likely {{a result of}} three potential processes. First, agglomeration may <b>have</b> <b>occurred</b> during handling or processing due to the high specific surface area of the nanoparticles.

5|$|Triple-doubles in NCAA tournament history: The NCAA began {{keeping track}} of assists for men's {{basketball}} in 1984, then blocks and steals in 1986, so officially this <b>has</b> <b>occurred</b> eight times. However, many tournaments had included assists, steals and blocks in their official boxscores prior to that time, so unofficially this <b>has</b> <b>occurred</b> sixteen times. Only three pre-1986 triple-doubles are included below.|$|E

5|$|Amanita muscaria {{poisoning}} <b>has</b> <b>occurred</b> {{in young}} children and in people who ingested the mushrooms for a hallucinogenic experience.

5|$|Hyperoxic myopia <b>has</b> <b>occurred</b> {{in closed}} circuit oxygen rebreather divers with {{prolonged}} exposures. It also occurs frequently in those undergoing repeated hyperbaric oxygen therapy. This {{is due to}} an increase in the refractive power of the lens, since axial length and keratometry readings do not reveal a corneal or length basis for a myopic shift. It is usually reversible with time.|$|E

5|$|Mercury {{was used}} inside wobbler lures. Its heavy, liquid form made it useful since the lures made an {{attractive}} irregular movement when the mercury moved inside the plug.
