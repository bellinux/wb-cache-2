40|$|The present paper {{focuses on}} the mixing {{improvement}} in a generic supersonic combustion chamber for a fixed combustion chamber height with wall injection. On the one hand, internal shocks are employed to increase mixing and penetration, on the other <b>hand</b> <b>injector</b> design and spacing are investigated to achieve good penetration and mixing. With sonic hole injectors, a reduction of the injector spacing improves the mixing efficiency almost proportionally due to the reduced required massflow per injector. At very high aspect ratios, the relative penetration is reduced and {{the air in the}} upper part of the duct does not mix properly with the fuel. Penetration improvement due to the internal shock system, and tilted, supersonic inline injectors are presented to improve the mixing efficiency...|$|E

The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the chemical composition mineral and cholesterol content of the different cuts (breast, drumstick and thigh) of raw guinea fowl meat. The study also aimed at establishing the effect of cooking method on guinea fowl quality attributes by investigating the effect of different cooking methods on the chemical composition and sensory attributes of the different cuts. The effect of injecting a brine solution on the chemical composition and sensory attributes were also investigated. There were no differences in terms of moisture content of the various cuts raw guinea fowl meat The breast had significantly higher protein content when compared to drumstick and thigh (P 0. 05). Whilst the drumstick had significantly the lowest value for ash content when compared to the thigh. Saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and total unsaturated fatty acids (TUFAs) were not different (P> 0. 05) in all the cuts. Drumstick had significantly higher monounsaturated fatty acids compared to other cuts (P 0. 05). This effect was significant for the breast, which had lost the most moisture (P 0. 05), but the cuts’ natural fat content was reflected especially in the open–roasting method (P 0. 4 Polyunsaturated:Saturated fatty acids (P:S) ratio, ranging from 0. 91 to 1. 42 between cuts and treatments. The n- 6 :n- 3 ratio was below the recommended beneficial value, namely 0. 05). Foil-wrap produced a more tender and juicier product (P 0. 05) between the injected and the control samples for any of the sensory attributes of aroma, tenderness, initial juiciness, sustained juiciness and flavour. Judge:treatment variations were observed for all the attributes, and samples differed for all attributes except for aroma. It is proposed that the use of the <b>hand</b> <b>injector</b> could not effectively distribute the brine solution, hence the recommendation to repeat the experiment using an electronic multineedle-injector. No effect was observed for the proximate composition (P> 0. 05). Further research pertaining to cooking methods of meat of free-range guinea fowl is recommended to address certain issues that have been highlighted...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The demand {{for the protection of}} the environment from air pollution and reduction of carbon dioxide has resulted in worldwide exhaust emissions regulations imposed on the diesel engines. Fortunately, diesel engine offers the best fuel economy and low emissions of carbon dioxide of most engines currently available. However, the engine's inherent drawbacks are that the engine is heavy, noisy, and expensive, in addition to producing significant level of particulates and nitrogen oxides emissions. The present research attempts to understand the combustion characteristics and emissions trade-off by experimental investigations of the diesel engine using a production Lister Petter 2. 97 litres, four-cylinder, high-speed, direct injection diesel engine. The investigation involved the analysis of the in-cylinder pressure data, heat release rate calculation and exhaust gas measurements of various injectors having different nozzle geometry. The engine experiments cover both the investigation of the fuel injection and the engine operating parameters such as injection rate, nozzle geometry, the engine load and speed. The effects of each parameter on ignition delay, heat release rate, nitrogen oxides emissions, smoke density, and total hydrocarbon levels were investigated. Two complementary diagnostic techniques were employed in order to assist in understanding the injection characteristics. The first technique involved the imaging of the fuel sprays from the different injectors in a constant volume spray chamber using a CCD camera. The images were than process using a dedicated image processing software. The second technique involved the measurements of the fuel injection rates from the injectors using the Bosch Tube meter. A three-zone model was developed to determine the heat release rate of combustion. The cylinder pressure data was used to validate the model written in Matlab computer programme. The model is based on the principles of the First Law of Thermodynamics applied to the three zones, formed due to the fuel injection into the combustion chamber. The heat release rate profiles produced by the model were used to analyse the formation of pollutants that were measured in the exhaust gas. The results showed that injectors with large nozzle hole diameters produced high smoke levels, especially at high engine load conditions with small increase in NOx. These injectors also caused the sprays to impinged on the combustion chamber walls at high load conditions. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>injectors</b> having small nozzle hole diameters produced high levels of NOx while the smoke emission levels were low.

40|$|SUMMARY: Endovascular {{surgical}} neuroradiologists {{can receive}} {{a substantial amount}} of occupational radiation exposure. We evaluated the amount of radiation exposure that results from the practice of performing hand injections during digital subtraction angiography (DSA). The primary operator can significantly decrease the radiation dose by leaving the room for DSA procedures. However, the total radiation dose for the primary operator is relatively low and is certainly within allowable regulatory limits when extrapolated to a yearly dose. Out of sight, out of mind {{can be applied to the}} scatteredradiation present during angiography. Angiographers can receive significant occupational exposures if safeguards are not instituted to limit their risk. Endovascular surgical neuro-radiology sessions are often long and can span several hours in difficult cases. The concept of limiting radiation exposure to as low as reasonably achievable mandates that physicians who use ionizing radiation in their practice limit unnecessary ex-posure to patients, ancillary staff, and themselves. 1 Several variables with a wide variation in use have a direct influence on operator radiation exposure. One such variable is the perfor-mance of hand injections during digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in lieuofusing apower <b>injector.</b> <b>Hand</b> injection technique requires that the primary operator stay near the patient to inject the contrast, whereas the power injector procedures allow the operator to stepaway fromthe table, therefore reducinghisorher exposure to scattered radiation. We attempted to measure the additional radiation exposure to a primary operator during en-dovascular head and neck sessions that results from standing at the table during DSA acquisitions...|$|R
40|$|One {{problem in}} the design of TeV hadron {{colliders}} arises from the choice of the radio frequency. To produce economically the short bunches needed during collision, a high frequency (400 MHz or more) is essential. On the other <b>hand,</b> in the <b>injector</b> chain at lower energies, lower frequencies are generally preferred to alleviate space charge and instability problems and, partially also, for historical reasons. The classical solution is to transform the bunch structure by passing via a debunched beam state, during which the whole machine circumference becomes filled with particles and the beam is subjected to induced parasitic fields and is often prone to microwave instabilities. Bunch merging and bunch splitting have therefore been developed as alternative methods that allow the number of bunches to be changed without passing via that state. Bunch merging has been used in the CERN-PS since 1989 for the anti-proton production beam. The reverse process of bunch splitting was first proposed in the frame of the CERN injector complex for LHC, as a means of quasi-adiabatically changing the time structure of the beam, increasing the number of bunches from four at low energy in the PS Booster to 16 at high energy in the PS. When the CERN accelerator complex re-started in March 1998, this technique became a routine operation. New plans are now being considered to replace the debunching-rebunching process that is still needed at 26 GeV/c in the PS to generate the train of 84 bunches required by the SPS and LHC. The experience gained in the application of bunch merging and splitting techniques is reviewed in this paper together with the extensions now envisaged and the analysis of the expected advantages with respect to the more classical process of debunching-rebunching...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{reproducibility}} and pitfalls of intracoronary and aortic root sonicated albumin injections, using time-intensity curves, in a large sample of normal dogs. Background. The utility of a new myocardial contrast echocar-diographic agent, sonicated serum albumin (Albunex), is currently under investigation. However, the reproducibility, injection techniques and general pitfalls of this contrast agent have not been well characterized. Methods. We administered sequential intracoronary and aortic root injections (518 injections) of sonicated albumin in 25 closed chest normal dogs to measure the effectiveness and reproducibility of this product. Time-intensity curves, as a measure of myocardial perfusion, were derived and quantified using an on-line videodensitometric analysis system and two-dimensional echocardiography. Measurements included peak intensity, area under the curve, half-time of descent, alpha-parameter and transit time within a 31 - × 31 -pixel “region of interest” in the anterior septum. Analyses provided 80 % power and a type I error protection of 95 %. Results. The best reproducibility of the variables was half-time of descent for aortic root injections (coefficient of variation [CV] 20 %) and peak intensity for intracoronary injections (CV 25 %), whereas aortic root area under the curve showed the most variability (CV 41 %). Analysis of variance for repeated measures of serial intracoronary and aortic root injections showed no significant systematic variability within subjects for the measured variables. In a comparison between intracoronary and aortic root injection sites, paired ttests showed no significant difference for mean values between these two techniques. There was also no statistically significant difference between manual versus power intracoronary injections. Finally, there was no significant difference among three injection rates (1, 2 and 3 ml/s) in paired intracoronary injections, nor was there a difference among injection rates in paired aortic root injections, except for a lower peak intensity with a 1 -ml/s injection rate compared with a 2 -ml/s injection rate (p = 0. 01). Potential pitfalls include preparation of sonicated albumin, delivery techniques and measurement variables. Conclusions. We conclude that the results of serial injections of sonicated albumin show no systematic change or trend in normal dogs. Both intracoronary and aortic root injections at standard injection rates by <b>hand</b> or power <b>injector</b> can be used to quantify time-intensity curves, as measure of myocardial perfusion, with similar variability ranging from 20 % to 41 %. These results are important in the human model, especially after coronary interventions...|$|R
