5|$|The recoil {{momentum}} of the produced mendelevium-256 atoms is used to bring them physically {{far away from the}} einsteinium target from which they are produced, bringing them onto a thin foil of metal (usually beryllium, aluminium, platinum, or gold) just behind the target in a vacuum. This eliminates the need for immediate chemical separation, which is both costly and prevents reusing of the expensive einsteinium target. The mendelevium atoms are then trapped in a gas atmosphere (frequently helium), and a <b>gas</b> <b>jet</b> from a small opening in the reaction chamber carries the mendelevium along. Using a long capillary tube, and including potassium chloride aerosols in the helium gas, the mendelevium atoms can be transported over tens of meters to be chemically analyzed and have their quantity determined. The mendelevium can then be separated from the foil material and other fission products by applying acid to the foil and then coprecipitating the mendelevium with lanthanum fluoride, then using a cation-exchange resin column with a 10% ethanol solution saturated with hydrochloric acid, acting as an eluant. However, if the foil is made of gold and thin enough, it is enough to simply dissolve the gold in aqua regia before separating the trivalent actinides from the gold using anion-exchange chromatography, the eluant being 6Mhydrochloric acid.|$|E

His British patent, No. 1636 of 1864, contains points of interest. He realized that the high velocity of the <b>gas</b> <b>jet</b> exiting his combustion chamber nozzle offered a practical difficulty, and proposed to remedy this by the use of successive induced jets of increasing volume and consequently lower velocity. This was shown in his drawing, with gases being delivered through collinear nozzles of increasing diameter, with the outer nozzles operating at increased gas volumes with reduced velocities, similar to the exhaust of a high-bypass turbofan jet engine.|$|E

500|$|At the 1934 party, Tesla {{told reporters}} he had {{designed}} a superweapon he claimed would end all war. He {{would call it}} [...] "teleforce", but was usually referred to as his death ray.

Tesla never revealed detailed plans of how the weapon worked during his lifetime but in 1984, they surfaced at the Nikola Tesla Museum archive in Belgrade. The treatise, The New Art of Projecting Concentrated Non-dispersive Energy through the Natural Media, described an open-ended vacuum tube with a <b>gas</b> <b>jet</b> seal that allows particles to exit, a method of charging slugs of tungsten or mercury to millions of volts, and directing them in streams (through electrostatic repulsion). Tesla tried to interest the US War Department, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia in the device.|$|E
500|$|Once the nobelium-255 is produced, {{it can be}} {{separated}} out {{in a similar way}} as used to purify the neighboring actinide mendelevium. The recoil momentum of the produced nobelium-255 atoms is used to bring them physically far away from the target from which they are produced, bringing them onto a thin foil of metal (usually beryllium, aluminium, platinum, or gold) just behind the target in a vacuum: this is usually combined by trapping the nobelium atoms in a gas atmosphere (frequently helium), and carrying them along with a <b>gas</b> <b>jet</b> from a small opening in the reaction chamber. Using a long capillary tube, and including potassium chloride aerosols in the helium gas, the nobelium atoms can be transported over tens of meters. The thin layer of nobelium collected on the foil can then be removed with dilute acid without completely dissolving the foil. The nobelium can then be isolated by exploiting its tendency to form the divalent state, unlike the other trivalent actinides: under typically used elution conditions (bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (HDEHP) as stationary organic phase and 0.05Mhydrochloric acid as mobile aqueous phase, or using 3Mhydrochloric acid as an eluant from cation-exchange resin columns), nobelium will pass through the column and elute while the other trivalent actinides remain on the column. However, if a direct [...] "catcher" [...] gold foil is used, the process is complicated by the need to separate out the gold using anion-exchange chromatography before isolating the nobelium by elution from chromatographic extraction columns using HDEHP.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{this article}} the authors present {{theoretical}} and {{experimental studies of}} gas-burning devices with the chordal feed of <b>gas</b> <b>jets.</b> The optimum diameter of the nozzles providing for the necessary range of <b>gas</b> <b>jets</b> for a high-quality mixing of fuel gas and air in the mixing chamber of minimum length is determined by calculation. The analysis of {{the parameters of the}} flame indirectly proves the reliability of the calculated data. The chordal flow of the <b>gas</b> <b>jets</b> and optimization of their range will significantly reduce the overall structural dimensions of the gas burner units. Short-flame gas-burning devices formed the basis for the creation of the Autonomous heat gun intended for repair and maintenance of engineering networks. Obtaining of a good heat gun is ensured by the motor fan capable of generating a high-pressure jet without connection to an external electrical network. Using of the autonomous heat gun in the housing and communal services is very promising in comparison with similar devices...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{the mixture}} {{formation}} processes of high pressure hydrogen jets were investigated using a constant-volume vessel. The mixture formations of steady <b>gas</b> <b>jets</b> injected into atmospheric pressure ambient are well known. However, {{there are few}} works about the mixture formations of high pressure hydrogen jets injected into high pressure ambient. Also, in gas releases having a pressure ratio of exit pressure to ambient pressure greater than 1. 89, underexpanded jet will be formed. So the mixture formations of high pressure <b>gas</b> <b>jets</b> {{are different from those}} of steady <b>gas</b> <b>jets.</b> Therefore, in this study, the jet flows near the nozzle exit and developing process of high pressure hydrogen jets were observed by shadowgraph photography with changing conditions of injection, ambient, and orifice diameter. In addition, the fuel distributions of unsteady jets were analyzed with Rayleigh scattering measurements. The conclusions of this study are shown as follows: (1) The pressure ratio has significant effects on underexpanded jet structures. (2) The jet penetration predicted by the modified momentum theory was in reasonable agreement with the experimental results for various condition of orifice diameter. (3) In the case of the smaller orifice, comparatively uniform mixtures distributed in the downstream region...|$|R
