25|$|After {{approximately}} {{two hours of}} captivity, Norris killed Ledford by strangling her with a wire coat hanger, which he tightened with pliers. Ledford did not react much to the act of strangulation, although she died with <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>open.</b> Bittaker then opted to discard her body on a random lawn in order to view the reaction from the press. The pair drove to a randomly selected house in Sunland and discarded Ledford's body in a bed of ivy upon the front lawn.|$|E
25|$|A tale {{explains}} {{her name}} Yamuna: Sanjna {{was unable to}} bear her husband, the sun's heat and light {{and closed her eyes}} in his presence. Surya felt insulted and said that their son will be known as Yama ("restraint"), due to the restraint she showed. Thereafter, Sanjna tried her best to keep <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>open,</b> however she flickered them angering Surya again who proclaimed that her daughter would be Yamuna. Since Sanjna had tried to keep the eyes open, Yamuna was blessed that she would worshipped as a goddess and remembered throughout time.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to praising Gellar's often under-appreciated acting, Buffy scholar Ian Shuttleworth {{comments on the}} cast and the nuanced numbness and confusion of the characters, paired with the moments of silence in the episode: [...] "It is simply {{one of the finest}} pieces of television drama, and the single finest depiction of bereavement in any medium, that I have ever seen." [...] Nikki Stafford, author of Bite Me! The Unofficial Guide to Buffy the Vampire Slayer, calls [...] "The Body" [...] "an absolute masterpiece", explaining that it is [...] "hands down the single most terrifying, heart-breaking, painful, and amazing hour of television I have ever seen". She praises the entire cast equally, but highlights Gellar, Alyson Hannigan, and Emma Caulfield. Stafford also praised Kristine Sutherland—as did Whedon—for having to lie motionless with <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> for hours upon hours over eight days of filming.|$|E
60|$|Dolores {{stood still}} {{and looked at}} him with <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>opened</b> in horror.|$|R
60|$|When <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>opened</b> again, Montalvo, officer, notary, and soldiers, all had vanished.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>opened</b> and a {{flash of}} her old manner returned. She smiled at him, feebly but derisively.|$|R
60|$|She {{laid her}} head down {{accordingly}} upon a mossy mound, and notwithstanding her resolution to keep <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>open,</b> in ten minutes she was fast asleep.|$|E
60|$|She {{pulled herself}} together, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> frightfully wide now. The {{tropical}} afternoon was lengthening the {{shadows on the}} hot, weary earth, the abode of obscure desires, of extravagant hopes, of unimaginable terrors.|$|E
6000|$|MRS. BRENNAN (nudging Carmody {{with her}} elbow--in a harsh whisper). She don't see us. It's a dream she's in with <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>open.</b> Glory be, it's bad she's lookin'. The {{look on her}} face'd frighten you. Speak to her, you! ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>opened</b> {{to their}} widest, so {{surprised}} that the lashes {{had no time for}} their usual play.|$|R
60|$|After a while, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>opened.</b> Joan drew <b>her</b> chair nearer {{and slipped}} her arm in under <b>her,</b> and their <b>eyes</b> met.|$|R
60|$|The air {{of mystery}} which enveloped and {{transformed}} {{the man had}} {{its effect on the}} woman. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>opened</b> wide.|$|R
60|$|Accustomed {{to sleep}} {{for two or three}} hours during the heat of the day, Madame Duchesne was indeed feeling so drowsy that she could with {{difficulty}} keep <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>open,</b> and she now {{in the course of a}} few minutes was breathing quietly and regularly.|$|E
60|$|The servants, {{answering}} {{the call for}} help, carry her into the house. They lay her insensible on her bed. After {{half an hour or}} more, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> again--this time with the light of life in them--open, and rest languidly on the friend sitting by the bedside.|$|E
60|$|Henry Seyton bowed, and Catherine and Lady Fleming {{attended}} the Queen to her apartment; where, acknowledging {{to them that}} she should have found it difficult in that moment to keep her promise of holding <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>open,</b> she resigned herself to repose, and awakened not till the morning was advanced.|$|E
60|$|Captain Horton began cursing her again; {{but just}} then Fan's bosom moved, she drew a long breath, and {{presently}} <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>opened.</b>|$|R
60|$|Frances Freeland, who during Felix's long speech {{had almost}} closed <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>opened</b> them, and looked piercingly {{at the top}} of his head.|$|R
60|$|Roger {{took the}} girl's hand. As he did so, a slight tremor ran through her, {{as if she}} {{recognized}} his touch. Then <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>opened.</b>|$|R
60|$|Once {{more she}} had betrayed her husband {{into the hands}} of those who would not let him escape a second time. And now she had done it with <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>open,</b> with loving, passionate heart which ached for self-sacrifice, and only succeeded in imperilling the loved one more hopelessly than before.|$|E
60|$|Leaping on {{his back}} he shook the reins, and his daughter, who {{knew what to expect}} and had <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>open,</b> saw the horse start forward, and in the {{twinkling}} of an eye changed her own steed into a cell, the prince into a hermit, and herself into a nun.|$|E
6000|$|... "I’ve {{asked the}} landlady to keep <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> a bit," [...] said the Chief. [...] "My wife {{was brought up}} in the country, and she’s very young and simple, so that it is quite right and proper for her to have a motherly old body to look after her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess I'm {{acting like}} a frightened rabbit, but I can't help it. If they caught me now they'd----" [...] <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>opened</b> wide and staring.|$|R
60|$|Fay's long lashes fluttered; <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>opened.</b> At {{first they}} seemed glazed over. They looked dazed by pain. Then they quickened, darkened, to shine with intelligence--bewilderment--memory--and sudden {{wonderful}} joy.|$|R
60|$|Into {{her hand}} {{something}} was laid {{that was very}} heavy and very cold, and when <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>opened</b> she saw it was a stack of fifteen twenty-dollar gold pieces.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sure it will, Ben. I {{can tell}} you that it is as much as I can do, sometimes, not to burst out crying when I see her sitting, by the hour, with <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>open,</b> but not seeing anything, or moving as much as a finger--just thinking, and thinking, and thinking.|$|E
60|$|And so she had. Even {{before she}} saw John the fever had been upon her, and that awful revelation had brought it out {{suddenly}} in full force. She lay unconscious upon the bed, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>open,</b> staring ghastlily, {{but not a}} trace of colour in her cheek nor a sign of life upon her face.|$|E
60|$|She did not faint, {{she did not}} scream; one faint, low, wailing cry {{broke from}} her, and then she stood, rigid and immovable, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>open</b> and staring, her lips parted, and every vestige of colour gone from her face. One hand clasped her throat; the other, clenched and rigid, rested on the table.|$|E
60|$|Sally did {{not like}} his tone. He seemed to be criticizing her, and she resented {{criticism}} from a stranger. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>opened</b> wide and she looked dangerously across the table.|$|R
6000|$|Regina started: <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>opened</b> widely, {{and rested}} on Amelius with an {{expression}} of incredulous wonder. [...] "Married in a fortnight?" [...] she repeated. [...] "What would my uncle and aunt say?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Give me to drink," [...] she moaned, and I did so, pouring {{the water}} down her throat, which was ridged and black like a dog's palate. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>opened</b> {{and she knew}} me.|$|R
60|$|Out {{went all}} {{the lights in the}} new palace, and {{everything}} was as silent as death and as black as ink. The door opened, and in came the nine men in red, with torches burning as red as blood. They took Selim the Fisherman by the arms and led him to the beautiful statue, and there she was with <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>open.</b>|$|E
60|$|She sat {{perfectly}} listless, with {{a vacant}} yet steadfast {{expression on her}} thin features, {{as if she were}} dreaming with <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>open.</b> The view before her was such as might indeed arouse the admiration of the most stolid; but it was evident that she took no notice of it, for her eyes were fixed on the clouds above the horizon.|$|E
6000|$|It {{must have}} been that she grew very sleepy--probably the heat weighed her eyelids down--certainly she found it {{impossible}} to keep <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>open,</b> and Maurice apparently thought that she felt faint. Always in the same vague way she heard him making suggestions for her comfort: [...] "Could he get her some wine?" [...] or [...] "Should he try and find Madame la Duchesse?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quick as thought, {{the girl}} stooped after the {{fluttering}} slip. Holding it {{spread out in}} both hands, she looked at it; then, without raising <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>opened</b> <b>her</b> fingers slowly and let it fall.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>opened.</b> They {{gazed at}} Mr. Wells on one side, at Edwards {{standing}} {{at the foot of}} the bed, at Heckewelder leaning over her, but there was no recognition or interest in her look.|$|R
60|$|The {{tables were}} turned at this point. The man's {{appearance}} proved {{too much for}} the girl. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>opened</b> wide, <b>her</b> brilliant teeth appeared, and, standing erect, she burst into a fit of merry laughter.|$|R
