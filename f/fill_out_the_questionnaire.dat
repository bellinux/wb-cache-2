2500|$|The leave {{clearance}} registration process, {{dubbed the}} [...] "loyalty questionnaire" [...] by inmates, was another {{significant source of}} discontent among incarcerated Japanese Americans. Originally drafted as a War Department recruiting tool, the 28 questions were hastily, and poorly, revised for their new purpose of assessing inmate loyalty. The form was largely devoted to determining whether the respondent was a [...] "real" [...] American — baseball or judo, Boy Scouts or Japanese school — {{but most of the}} ire was directed at two questions that asked inmates to volunteer for combat duty and forswear their allegiance to the Emperor of Japan. Many were offended at being asked to risk their lives for a country that had imprisoned them, and believed the question of allegiance was an implicit accusation that they had been disloyal to the United States. Although most answered in the affirmative to both, 15 percent of the total inmate population refused to <b>fill</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>questionnaire</b> or answered [...] "no" [...] to one or both questions.

50|$|Self-report {{studies have}} many advantages, {{but they also}} suffer from {{specific}} disadvantages due to the way that subjects generally behave. Self-reported answers may be exaggerated; respondents may be too embarrassed to reveal private details; various biases may affect the results, like social desirability bias. Subjects may also forget pertinent details. Self-report studies are inherently biased by the person's feelings {{at the time they}} filled out the questionnaire. If a person feels bad at the time they <b>fill</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>questionnaire,</b> for example, their answers will be more negative. If the person feels good at the time, then the answers will be more positive.|$|E

30|$|In {{face-to-face}} interviews with head teachers, {{we explained the}} aims of the study, the procedures to be followed and the instrument to be used. Once a school had agreed to participate, the conditions were set for the students’ families to receive the informed consent documents. Those families that allowed their children to take part returned the informed consent forms to the school, and we then proceeded to apply the instruments, which were applied in group format by members of the research team. <b>The</b> instructions for <b>filling</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>questionnaires</b> were read aloud in the classroom and <b>the</b> students <b>filled</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>questionnaires</b> in normal lesson time.|$|R

Participants were told that the psychologists were studying the [...] "Quality of Life" [...] in North America. These participants included men and women that had attended Werner Erhard and Associates' [...] "The Forum" [...] seminar in 1985, in a large city in the northeastern United States. Participants in the study were split into Group 1 and Group 2. Group 1 was told to fill out a questionnaire both prior to and after completing their [...] "Forum".

TAPPS responded by asking Iman to complete a questionnaire with questions like [...] "Historically, {{there is nothing in}} the Koran that fully embraces Christianity or Judaism in the way a Christian and/or a Jew understands his religion.

30|$|Questionnaires were {{individually}} {{filled in}} {{during or after}} a group training session at the sports venue. Informed consent was arranged orally on the spot and confirmed in writing. The researcher explained {{the purpose of the}} study at each session. Both the researcher and trained assistants helped respondents who had difficulty <b>filling</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>questionnaire</b> by giving instructions or by adopting an interview style. The number of assistants varied with group composition: from one for groups with only Dutch native speakers to a maximum of five in groups with migrant respondents. Dutch was the working language, since ethnic diversity within groups was large (> 10 countries of origin). Interpretation, if needed, was provided by an assistant or a fellow group member from a similar background, sufficiently proficient in Dutch.

Because outliers may bias the mean and influence the normal distribution (Field and Hole 2003), participants who were unable to <b>fill</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>questionnaire</b> completely {{were removed from the}} dataset prior to the data analysis. To locate outliers, we used descriptive statistics, box plots (Byrne 2001). Our study yielded a total of 487 complete and usable responses.|$|E
