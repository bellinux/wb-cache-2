25|$|All 567 engines utilize forced induction, {{with either}} a Roots blower or a {{turbocharger}}. The turbocharger (a combination turbo-compressor system) follows EMD's innovative design that uses a gear train and over-running clutch to drive the compressor rotor during low engine speed, when exhaust <b>gas</b> <b>temperature</b> (and, correspondingly, heat energy) alone is insufficient to drive the turbine. At higher engine speeds, increased exhaust <b>gas</b> <b>temperature</b> is sufficient to drive the turbine and the clutch disengages, turning the turbo-compressor system into a true turbocharger. The turbo-compressor can revert to compressor mode momentarily during demands for large increases in engine output power. While more expensive to maintain than Roots blowers, the turbocharger significantly reduces fuel consumption and emissions, while improving high-altitude performance. Additionally, EMD's turbo-compressor can provide a 50 percent increase in maximum rated horsepower over Roots-blown engines for the same engine displacement.|$|E

The EMS then uses the collected data to precisely determine how much fuel to deliver and when and how far to advance the ignition timing. With electronic ignition systems, individual cylinders can have their own individual timing so that timing can be as aggressive as possible per cylinder without fuel detonation.

2500|$|A {{condenser}} is {{an apparatus}} or {{item of equipment}} used to condense (change the physical state of a substance from its gaseous to its liquid state). In the laboratory, condensers are generally used in procedures involving organic liquids brought into the gaseous state through heating, with or without lowering the pressure (applying vacuum)—though applications in inorganic and other chemistry areas exist. While condensers can be applied at various scales, in the research, training, or discovery laboratory, one most often uses glassware designed to pass a vapor flow over an adjacent cooled chamber. In simplest form, such a condenser consists of a single glass tube with outside air providing cooling. A further simple form, the Liebig-type of condenser, involves concentric glass tubes, an inner one through which the hot gases pass, and an outer, [...] "ported" [...] chamber through which a cooling fluid passes, to reduce the <b>gas</b> <b>temperature</b> in the inner, to afford the condensation.|$|E
2500|$|Since the Stirling {{engine is}} a closed cycle, it {{contains}} a fixed mass of gas called the [...] "working fluid", most commonly air, hydrogen or helium. In normal operation the engine is sealed and no gas enters or leaves the engine. No valves are required, unlike other types of piston engines. The Stirling engine, like most heat engines, cycles through four main processes: cooling, compression, heating and expansion. This is accomplished by moving the gas {{back and forth between}} hot and cold heat exchangers, often with a regenerator between the heater and cooler. The hot heat exchanger is in thermal contact with an external heat source, such as a fuel burner, and the cold heat exchanger is in thermal contact with an external heat sink, such as air fins. A change in <b>gas</b> <b>temperature</b> causes a corresponding change in gas pressure, while the motion of the piston causes the gas to be alternately expanded and compressed.|$|E
