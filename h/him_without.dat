5|$|In 1915 Marquis' {{marriage}} {{began to}} fail. His {{family moved to}} Bozeman, leaving <b>him</b> <b>without</b> a receptionist, a role previously filled by his wife. At the same time, another practice had opened in Clyde Park, drawing away some of his business. In November 1916 Marquis closed his Clyde Park practice and moved to Livingston to share an office with the city health official.|$|E

5|$|Sarah's {{concern for}} her grandchildren briefly {{came to a}} halt, however, when in 1716 her husband had two strokes, the second of which left <b>him</b> <b>without</b> the ability to speak. Sarah {{spent much of her}} time with him, {{accompanying}} him to Tunbridge Wells and Bath, and he recovered shortly afterwards. Even after his recovery, Sarah opened his correspondence and filtered the letters Marlborough received, lest their contents precipitate another stroke.|$|E
5|$|When Emeric's son, Ladislaus, {{was born}} around 1200, Andrew's hopes to succeed his brother as king were shattered. Pope Innocent {{confirmed}} the child's position as {{heir to the}} crown, declaring that Andrew's future sons would only inherit Andrew's duchy. Andrew planned a new rebellion against his brother, but King Emeric captured <b>him</b> <b>without</b> resistance near Varaždin in October 1203.|$|E

5|$|As a character, Spencer {{has been}} seen as an everyman figure, his blank {{expression}} and plain dress keeping him a simple archetype. Spencer displays a pacifistic and fatalistic inactivity throughout the film, simply allowing events to unfold around <b>him</b> <b>without</b> taking control. This passive behavior culminates in his sole act of instigation at the film's climax; his apparent act of infanticide is driven by his life of being domineered and controlled. Spencer's inactivity has also been seen by film critics Colin Odell and Michelle Le Blanc as a precursor to Lynch's 1983–92 comic strip The Angriest Dog in the World.|$|E
5|$|At Horace Mann Elementary School in Seattle {{during the}} mid-1950s, Hendrix's habit of {{carrying}} a broom {{with him to}} emulate a guitar gained {{the attention of the}} school's social worker. After {{more than a year of}} his clinging to a broom like a security blanket, she wrote a letter requesting school funding intended for underprivileged children, insisting that leaving <b>him</b> <b>without</b> a guitar might result in psychological damage. Her efforts failed, and Al refused to buy him a guitar.|$|E
5|$|His half-brother, Muhammad Kam Bakhsh, {{marched to}} Bijapur in March 1707 with his soldiers. When {{the news of}} Aurangzeb's death spread through the city, the city's monarch, King Sayyid Niyaz Khan {{surrendered}} the fort to <b>him</b> <b>without</b> a fight. Ascending the throne, Kam Bakhsh made Ahsan Khan, {{who served in the}} army as the bakshi (general of the armed forces), and made his advisor Taqarrub Khan as chief minister and gave himself the title of Padshah Kam Bakhsh-i-Dinpanah (Emperor Kam Bakhsh, Protector of Faith). He then conquered Kulbarga and Wakinkhera.|$|E

5|$|His public enemies, {{even the}} men who {{directed}} the fatal shot, ne'er spoke or wrote of <b>him</b> <b>without</b> expressions of marked respect; those whom he commanded loved him even to idolatry; and I, his associate and commander, fail in words adequate to express my opinion of his great worth. I feel assured that every patriot in America, on hearing this sad news, will {{feel a sense of}} personal loss, and the country generally will realize that we have lost, not only an able military leader, but a man who, had he survived, was qualified to heal the national strife which has been raised by designing and ambitious men.|$|E
5|$|Meredith had to {{deal with}} {{extremely}} physical defences, and was often boxed into the corner of the pitch by as many as four players. As his talents became widely regarded, more well organised defences would designate him with a man-marker, to try and isolate him from his teammates. This often left him reliant on an unselfish inside-right partner willing to fetch and carry the ball for <b>him</b> <b>without</b> expecting much in terms of goals or glory in return. A hard-working wing-half would also improve Meredith's effectiveness by winning the ball and sending him a pass down the flank. The best teams he played in also had a centre-forward able {{to make the most of}} his accurate crosses.|$|E
5|$|Republican Foster A. Dunlap had won {{the office}} in 1953, {{making it one of}} the few his party {{controlled}} in the city. The party renominated <b>him</b> <b>without</b> opposition. Democrat Alexander Hemphill was the organization-backed candidate, and he defeated political outsider George Glick without difficulty. Hemphill, who had worked with reformers in the campaigns that ultimately defeated the Republican organization in 1951, was a lawyer with a long history of involvement in Democratic politics. Unlike in the district attorney's race, the Democrats were united on the choice for city controller and Clark and Dilworth both publicly endorsed Hemphill. The result was a solid victory for the Democrats as Hemphill was elected by a thirteen-point margin.|$|E

5|$|The Danish statesman Hannibal Sehested was {{instructed}} by Frederick III {{to negotiate with}} the Swedes, and the resulting peace treaty can largely be credited to <b>him.</b> <b>Without</b> any direct involvement by foreign powers, the Danes and Swedes managed to negotiate the Treaty of Copenhagen within weeks, much to the surprise of both parties. A bone of contention was the islands of Hven and Bornholm, the latter having received the Danish king's personal promise of protection. In the end, Bornholm remained under Danish control in exchange for a number of estates in the south of present-day Sweden.|$|E
5|$|The Grenztruppen {{were closely}} watched {{to ensure that}} they could not take {{advantage}} of their inside knowledge to escape across the border. Patrols, watchtowers and observation posts were always manned by two or three guards at a time. They were not allowed to go out of each other's sight in any circumstances. If a guard attempted to escape, his colleagues were under instructions to shoot <b>him</b> <b>without</b> hesitation or prior warning; 2,500 did escape to the West, 5,500 more were caught and imprisoned for up to five years, and a number were shot and killed or injured in the attempt.|$|E
5|$|There were {{calls for}} Diefenbaker's retirement, {{especially}} from the Bay Street {{wing of the party}} as early as 1964. Diefenbaker initially beat back attempts to remove <b>him</b> <b>without</b> trouble. When Pearson called an election in 1965 in the expectation of receiving a majority, Diefenbaker ran an aggressive campaign. The Liberals fell two seats short of a majority, and the Tories improved their position slightly {{at the expense of the}} smaller parties. After the election, some Tories, led by party president Dalton Camp, began a quiet campaign to oust Diefenbaker.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} from Kyoto, Keitarō and Naru decide to retake the exams. After a while, Mutsumi moves to Tokyo, {{and the three}} begin to study together. During this period, Naru becomes convinced that Mutsumi is Keitarō's promised girl, but Mutsumi states that she made a childhood promise with Naru, not Keitarō. During {{the next round of}} Tokyo University exams, Keitarō believes he has failed them once again and runs away before finding out his results. After learning of this, Naru chases after <b>him</b> <b>without</b> checking her exam results either, and they are followed {{by the rest of the}} residents of Hinata House who announce that Keitarō and Naru both passed the exams along with Mutsumi. Unfortunately for him, Keitarō has an accident at the Tokyo University opening ceremony and is unable to attend classes for three months. After recovering from his injuries, Keitarō decides to study overseas with Noriyasu Seta. As Keitarō is about to leave, Naru finally confesses her feelings to him at the airport and decides to wait for him to return.|$|E

Having waited six months for Mike to wake up, she reluctantly enters a {{relationship}} with Ian Hainsworth (Dougray Scott), a British man whose wife, Jane (Cecily Gambrell), has been in a coma for years.

Meanwhile, Susan is suspicious of Orson, who has married Bree and is accused of killing his missing ex-wife, Alma (Valerie Mahaffey). When Mike is arrested for the murder of Monique Polier (Kathleen York), Orson's former mistress, Edie breaks up with him, leaving <b>him</b> <b>without</b> bail. Susan defends Mike, which frustrates Ian. He promises to pay for Mike's bail if Susan breaks off all contact with him. Mike is eventually acquitted for the crime. Following Jane's death, Susan accepts Ian's marriage proposal.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{tries to}} trick Blofeld into leaving Switzerland so that MI6 can arrest <b>him</b> <b>without</b> violating Swiss sovereignty. Blofeld refuses and Bond is {{eventually}} caught by henchwoman Irma Bunt. Blofeld reveals that he identified Bond after {{his attempt to}} lure him out of Switzerland, and tells his henchmen to take the agent away. Bond eventually makes his escape by skiing down Piz Gloria while Blofeld and his men give chase. Arriving at the village of Lauterbrunnen, Bond finds Tracy and they escape Bunt and her men after a car chase. A blizzard forces them to a remote barn, where Bond professes his love to Tracy and proposes marriage to her, which she accepts. The next morning, as the flight resumes, Blofeld sets off an avalanche; Tracy is captured, while Bond is buried but manages to escape.|$|E
