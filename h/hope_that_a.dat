5|$|Although heavily outnumbered, the Greek Allies were {{persuaded by}} the Athenian general Themistocles {{to bring the}} Persian fleet to battle again, in the <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> victory would prevent naval {{operations}} against the Peloponnese. The Persian king Xerxes was also eager for a decisive battle. As a result of subterfuge {{on the part of}} Themistocles, the Persian navy rowed into the Straits of Salamis and tried to block both entrances. In the cramped conditions of the Straits, the great Persian numbers were an active hindrance, as ships struggled to maneuver and became disorganized. Seizing the opportunity, the Greek fleet formed in line and scored a decisive victory.|$|E
5|$|In July 2010, RA {{organizers}} {{announced that}} the film festival would move from October 2010 to April 2011 because of funding shortfalls. One news source reported that RA organizers had intended to hold an October film festival, but a community fundraiser brought in only $5,000—far less than hoped, and not enough to allow an October festival to occur. The move to April was prompted, in part, by the <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> $75,000 D.C. government grant would allow the festival to occur. However, on March 8, 2011, RA officials cancelled the April event because of continuing heavy debt and because several grants had not been awarded to the organization. Festival organizers scheduled the 20th Reel Affirmations LGBTQ film festival for October 13–22, 2011.|$|E

5|$|Terang Boelan is {{considered}} lost, as are most domestic productions from the era. The Filipino film historian and director Nick Deocampo noted that productions made with nitrate film– such as Terang Boelan– burned easily and were thus easily lost, but suggested that {{copies of the}} film may have survived until the 1970s. In a 1991 publication Said, Heider, and the American translator John H. McGlynn expressed <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> copy of the film might be lying around in someone's attic or closet in Indonesia or the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|At S.H.I.E.L.D. base, the {{infected}} May starts seeing ghoulish images {{around her and}} begins attacking her fellow agents. She is subdued by the agency’s new director, Jeffrey Mace, a super-strong Inhuman who has her sent to a secret facility for treatment. He refuses to give this location to Phil Coulson, the former director who had stepped down with the <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> new powered director could help calm human-Inhuman relations. With Mace planning to announce S.H.I.E.L.D. {{to the world as}} a legitimate agency, he has had Coulson helping him with public relations. Mack asks Johnson to return to S.H.I.E.L.D. with them, as she was an agent and friend of theirs before leaving to become Quake. She refuses, and instead joins with Reyes in a partnership—he believes Momentum and the ghosts are connected to him.|$|E

5|$|Debate {{on church}} {{officers}} began on 19 October. The Assembly {{began with the}} issue of ordination, as many of the divines were concerned about the rise of various sectarian movements and the lack of any mechanism for ordination of ministers of the established church. While some members did not seem to think ordination necessary for preachers (though they should not administer the sacraments without it), a majority of the divines thought any regular preaching without ordination unacceptable and wished to erect a provisional presbytery for purposes of ordination. There was also debate at this early stage over the nature of the visible church. The congregationalists considered a church to be a single local congregation, while the majority considered the national church to be a unity and were alarmed at the prospect of a disintegrated English church. Despite these debates, up until the end of 1643 there was <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> common church government could be framed that would be satisfactory to all parties involved.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the fall}} of Steeple Tree Hill, the Japanese were less {{inclined}} to engage the Australian forces, nevertheless the advance continued to be frustratingly slow for the Australian commanders. The terrain over which the final part of the advance was undertaken was particularly taxing on the troops involved. Many of the slopes up which {{they were required to}} advance had gradients of at least 45 degrees, which meant that even reasonably short distances took considerable time To make matters worse, near the junction of the Siki Creek, a landslide caused by the Allied bombing, coupled with a number of land mines that the Japanese had planted, blocked the main road to Sattelberg, meaning that the soldiers from the 2/48th would have to make the final attack on Sattelberg without armoured support. In an effort to counter this problem, Whitehead determined that the tanks would be re-allocated to the 2/23rd, in the <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> new route would be opened up by the engineers.|$|E
5|$|On a {{hard pitch}} in very cold weather, Small Heath had already conceded twice at Blackburn Rovers before Billy Ollis was injured {{midway through the}} first half and played no further part. The {{visitors}} put up a fight, but the numerical disavantage was too much for them and the final score of 9–1 remains the club's joint-record losing margin. With no competitive fixture scheduled for the next two weeks, the club undertook a tour. Their opening match, in Plymouth, was the first visit of a professional club to the south-west of England. The Home Park club had ambitions to bring professional league football to the region, and in front of a crowd of 4,000 their team performed well before conceding three second-half goals. Small Heath's tour ended with a 2–1 defeat at Manchester City, and they returned to a celebratory dinner in honour of the club's promotion to the First Division. The chairman presented medals to the players, congratulated them on their showing thus far, and proposed a toast to their health, in the <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> full-strength team might be available by the next League match in ten days time.|$|E

25|$|Early road {{construction}} was both hindered and helped by rail transport {{during the first}} half century of European settlement. Authorities were reluctant to expend large amounts of capital on more difficult sections of a route where there was a <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> railway might instead be built. However, where railways were constructed, roads often either preceded them for construction or quickly followed it when the newly accessible land started to be settled more closely.|$|E
25|$|One {{example of}} this is necrotizing {{enterocolitis}} (NEC), which is a devastating disease that affects the bowels of premature infants. The symptoms of NEC are very similar to those of sepsis, and many infants die awaiting diagnosis and treatment. MALDI/TOF was used to quickly analyze fecal samples and find differences between the mutant and the functional protein responsible for NEC. There is <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> similar technique {{could be used as a}} quick, diagnostic tool that would not require sequencing.|$|E
25|$|Winand Wigger {{was born}} in New York City to John Joseph and Elizabeth (née Strucke) Wigger, who immigrated to the United States from Westphalia in the late 1830s.

He was a sickly child and the family {{returned}} to Germany in December 1843 in the <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> sea voyage might better his health.

25|$|As a compromise, {{an act of}} the Canadian {{parliament}} {{introduced the}} gold standard into Canada, based on both the British gold sovereign and the American Gold Eagle coins. The gold sovereign was legal tender at a rating of $US4.86⅔. No coinage was provided for under the 1853 act. Sterling coinage was made legal tender, and all other silver coins were demonetized. Dollar transactions were legalized. The Government in London agreed in principle to a decimal coinage but held out the <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> sterling unit would be adopted under the name 'Royal'. However, the Canadian authorities were determined to align with the US dollar and in 1857 {{the decision was made}} to introduce a decimal coinage into Canada in conjunction with the American unit.|$|E
25|$|In October 1912 the {{publisher}} of Rhythm, Charles Granville (sometimes known as Stephen Swift), absconded to Europe and left Murry responsible for the debts the magazine had accumulated. Mansfield pledged her father's allowance towards the magazine, but it was discontinued, being reorganised as The Blue Review in 1913 and folding after three issues. Mansfield and Murry were persuaded by their friend Gilbert Cannan to rent a cottage next to his windmill in Cholesbury, Buckinghamshire in 1913, {{in an attempt to}} alleviate Mansfield's ill health. In January 1914 the couple moved to Paris, in the <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> change of setting would make writing easier for both of them.
