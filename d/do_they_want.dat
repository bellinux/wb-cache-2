500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1894, Crane offered the {{finished}} manuscript of The Red Badge of Courage to McClure's Magazine, which had become the foremost magazine for Civil War literature. [...] While McClure's delayed giving him an answer on his novel, they offered him an assignment writing about the Pennsylvania coal mines. [...] "In the Depths of a Coal Mine", a story with pictures by Linson, was syndicated by McClure's {{in a number of}} newspapers, heavily edited. [...] Crane was reportedly disgusted by the cuts, asking Linson: [...] "Why the hell did they send me up there then? <b>Do</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> the public to think the coal mines gilded ball-rooms with the miners eating ice-cream in boiled shirt-fronts?" ...|$|E
500|$|During oral arguments, Chief Justice John Roberts {{noted that}} the case was a [...] "very {{familiar}} situation of an apprentice who is both an employee and a student," [...] {{and that the only}} way that one could draw a line between the two [...] "is to have somebody say: This {{is going to be the}} line." [...] He was of the opinion that if anyone should draw the line, the Internal Revenue Service should be the one. Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor, on the other hand, felt that residents were employees, as evidenced by her statement [...] "You don't think receiving $50,000 or $60,000 a year is enough to make you an employee of someone?" [...] According to The Wall Street Journal, Associate Justice Samuel Alito appeared to be more favorable to the medical schools, asking the Justice Department's lawyer at one point [...] "in general, why do medical students become residents? Are they enrolled in the program to make money...or <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> additional education?" ...|$|E

The Professor became suddenly so stern, that if the twins could have seen his expression--which, owing to the fading light, they couldn't--they would have been too frightened to answer.|$|R

500|$|Xbox One X is {{compatible}} with all existing Xbox One software and accessories. Games marketed as Xbox One X Enhanced have specific optimizations for graphical fidelity on the console's hardware, while separate iconography {{is being used to}} denote games that natively run at 4K resolution, or support HDR. Existing games may receive updates to provide enhancements or additional 4K support for Xbox One X. Though Xbox Games marketing head Aaron Greenberg stated that Xbox One X will have no exclusive titles, general manager of game publishing Shannon Loftis remarked in a follow-up interview that he was not sure on this point, and exclusivity would be [...] "up to the game development community what <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to do." [...] Spencer also touted that Xbox One X's hardware could also be used to support virtual reality, noting that especially at a console price point, [...] "having something at six teraflops that will get millions of people buying it is very attractive to some of the VR companies that are out there already, and we've architected it such that something will be able to plug right in and work." [...] However, Microsoft has not yet announced any official plans for VR support on Xbox One X, stating that it wished to prioritize wireless VR efforts on console, and Windows Mixed Reality on PC.|$|E

2500|$|The {{bidding process}} is {{designed}} to create competition. [...] When multiple parties want the same thing, pit them against one another.

[...] Her reaction was echoed in the screenplay when Norma Desmond declares, [...] "Without me there wouldn't be any Paramount." [...] In her memoir, Swanson recalled asking Cukor if it was unreasonable to refuse the screen test. He replied that since Norma Desmond was the role for which she would be remembered, [...] "If they ask you to do ten screen tests, do ten screen tests, or I will personally shoot you." [...] His enthusiasm convinced Swanson to participate, and she signed a contract for $50,000. In a 1975 interview, Wilder recalled Swanson's reaction with the observation, [...] "There was a lot of Norma in her, you know." ...|$|E
