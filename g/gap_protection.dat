Thus, if the vehicle is damaged beyond economical repair at this point, the owner will still owe potentially thousands of dollars on the loan. The escalating price of cars, longer-term auto loans, and the increasing popularity of leasing gave birth to <b>GAP</b> <b>protection.</b> GAP waivers provide protection for consumers when a [...] "gap" [...] exists between the actual value of their vehicle and the amount of money owed to the bank or leasing company.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{strategy}} for producing multi-qubit gates that promise high fidelity with minimal tuning requirements. Our strategy combines <b>gap</b> <b>protection</b> from the adiabatic theorem with dynamical decoupling in a complementary manner. To avoid degenerate states and maximize {{the benefit of the}} <b>gap</b> <b>protection,</b> the scheme is best suited when there are two different kinds of qubits (not mutually resonant). Furthermore, we require a robust operating point in control space where the qubits interact with little sensitivity to noise. This allows us to circumvent a No-Go theorem that prevents block-box dynamically corrected gates [Phys. Rev. A 80, 032314 (2009) ]. We show how to apply our strategy to an architecture in Si with P donors where we assume we can shuttle electrons between different donors. Electron spins act as mobile ancillary qubits and P nuclear spins act as long-lived data qubits. This system can have a very robust operating point where the electron spin is bound to a donor in the quadratic Stark shift regime. High fidelity single qubit gates may be performed using well-established global magnetic resonance pulse sequences. Single electron spin preparation and measurement has also been demonstrated. Putting this all together, we present a robust universal gate set for quantum computation. Comment: Added noise sensitivity figures (matching published version...|$|E
40|$|Laser cooled and quantum {{degenerate}} atoms {{are widely}} being pursued as quantum simulators {{that may explain}} the behavior of strongly correlated material systems, and {{as the basis of}} today's most precise sensors. A key challenge towards these goals is to understand and control coherent interactions between the atoms. Here, we observe long-range exchange interactions mediated by an optical cavity, which manifest as tunable spin-spin interactions on the pseudo spin- 1 / 2 system composed of the millihertz linewidth clock transition in strontium. We observe the so-called one axis twisting dynamics, the emergence of a many-body energy gap, and signatures of <b>gap</b> <b>protection</b> of the optical coherence against certain sources of decoherence. These effects manifest in the output of a pulsed, superradiant laser operating on the millihertz linewidth transition. Our observations will aid in the future design of versatile quantum simulators that take advantage of the unique control and probing capabilities of cavity QED and the rich internal structure of long-lived Sr atoms. They also open a route {{for the next generation of}} atomic clocks that utilize quantum correlations for enhanced metrology. Comment: 7 pages, 4 figures plus supplemen...|$|E

40|$|While {{adiabatic}} {{quantum computation}} (AQC) possesses some intrinsic robustness to noise, {{it is expected}} that a form of error control will be necessary for large scale computations. Error control ideas developed for circuit-model quantum computation do not transfer easily to the AQC model and to date there have been two main proposals to suppress errors during an AQC implementation: energy <b>gap</b> <b>protection</b> and dynamical decoupling. Here we show that these two methods are fundamentally related and may be analyzed within the same formalism. We analyze the effectiveness of such error suppression techniques and identify critical constraints on the performance of error suppression in AQC, suggesting that error suppression by itself is insufficient for fault-tolerant, large-scale AQC and that a form of error correction is needed.

40|$|Adiabatic quantum {{computation}} (AQC) {{is known to}} possess some intrinsic robustness, though {{it is likely that}} some form of error correction will be necessary for large scale computations. Error handling routines developed for circuit-model {{quantum computation}} do not transfer easily to the AQC model since these routines typically require high-quality quantum gates, a resource not generally allowed in AQC. There are two main techniques known to suppress errors during an AQC implementation: energy <b>gap</b> <b>protection</b> and dynamical decoupling. Here we show that both these methods are intimately related and can be analyzed within the same formalism. We analyze the effectiveness of such error suppression techniques and identify critical constraints on the performance of error suppression in AQC, suggesting that error suppression by itself is insufficient for large-scale, fault-tolerant AQC and that a form of error correction is needed. We discuss progress towards implementing error correction in AQC and enumerate several key outstanding problems. This work is a companion paper to "Error suppression and error correction in adiabatic quantum computation II: non-equilibrium dynamics"', which provides a dynamical model perspective on the techniques and limitations of error suppression and error correction in AQC.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the current system}} regulating state and corporate behavior with regards to human rights. As such it contributes to the debate on a global treaty on business and human rights through an interdisciplinary, human rights approach. The analysis takes a threefold approach to how one can best regulate corporations to secure an increased protection of rights. First, it asks {{whether there is a}} regulatory <b>gap</b> in <b>protection</b> in the current system. Reflecting on existing theories the hypothesis {{is that there is a}} <b>protection</b> <b>gap.</b> To assess the hypothesis the paper takes an empirical approach, building on data from a newly constructed database holding information on 82 global standards. Through a quantitative analysis of the standards, it concludes that there is a <b>gap</b> in <b>protection</b> that has to be addressed. Second, having established a gap, the analysis further examines corporate and sectorial standards as alternatives to a global treaty. Relying on the same data, it quantitatively analyses the alternatives. Taking a human rights approach, it compares standards on human rights language, inclusion of human rights treaties, strength, parties, and enforcement mechanisms. It concludes that while neither corporate nor sectorial standards appear to have the potential to close the gap, a combination between sectorial standards and a global treaty may be a good solution. Third, given the conclusion that a global treaty may be the best option, the final chapter asks if treaties have an impact. To answer the question, the paper {{examines the}} legislative impact of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FWCTC) on domestic legislation. Building on existing research and showing a clear link based on a newly constructed dataset, the analysis concludes that the FWCTC appears to have had a significant impact on the development of new regulation. Based on the theoretical discussions and empirical findings, the paper concludes that the best way to regulate corporations and states, to increase the protection of human rights, appears to be through a global framework convention; perhaps preferably supplemented by sectorial treaties...|$|R
