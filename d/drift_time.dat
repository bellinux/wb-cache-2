50|$|Multiwire {{proportional}} counters or solid-state counters {{are often}} used as detection medium, because they provide signals with pulse heights proportional to the ionization strength. An avalanche effect {{in the vicinity of}} the anode wires strung in the readout chambers, gives the necessary signal amplification. The positive ions created in the avalanche induce a positive current signal on the pad plane. The readout is performed by the 557 568 pads that form the cathode plane of the multi-wire proportional chambers (MWPC) located at the end plates. This gives the radial distance to the beam and the azimuth. The last coordinate, z along the beam direction, is given by the <b>drift</b> <b>time.</b> Since energy-loss fluctuations can be considerable, in general many pulse-height measurements are performed along the particle track in order to optimize the resolution of the ionization measurement.|$|E

Ambient pressure methods allow for higher resolving power and greater separation selectivity {{due to a}} higher rate of ion-molecule interactions and is typically used for stand-alone devices, as well as for detectors for gas, liquid, and supercriticial fluid chromatography. As shown above, the resolving power depends on the total voltage drop the ion traverses. Using a drift voltage of 25 kV in a 15 cm long atmospheric pressure drift tube, a resolving power above 250 is achievable even for small, single charged ions. This is sufficient to achieve separation of some isotopologues based on their difference in reduced mass μ.|$|E
40|$|One {{difficulty}} in using ion mobility (IM) mass spectrometry (MS) {{to improve the}} specificity of peptide ion assignments is that IM separations are performed using a range of pressures, gas compositions, temperatures, and modes of separation, which makes it challenging to rapidly extract accurate shape parameters.

These peptide ions have masses ranging from 231 to 2969 Da, Ω(He) of 89 - 616 Å(2), and Ω(N(2)) of 151 - 801 Å(2); thus, they are ideal for calibrating results from proteomics experiments. These results were used to quantify the errors associated with traveling-wave Ω measurements of peptide ions and the errors concomitant with using <b>drift</b> <b>times</b> measured in N(2) gas to estimate Ω(He).

50|$|A time {{projection}} chamber {{consists of}} a gas-filled detection volume in an electric field with a position-sensitive electron collection system. The original design (and the one most commonly used) is a cylindrical chamber with multi-wire proportional chambers (MWPC) as endplates. Along its length, the chamber is divided into halves {{by means of a}} central high-voltage electrode disc, which establishes an electric field between the center and the end plates. Furthermore, a magnetic field is often applied {{along the length of the}} cylinder, parallel to the electric field, in order to minimize the diffusion of the electrons coming from the ionization of the gas. On passing through the detector gas, a particle will produce primary ionization along its track. The z coordinate (along the cylinder axis) is determined by measuring the <b>drift</b> <b>time</b> from the ionization event to the MWPC at the end. This is done using the usual technique of a drift chamber. The MWPC at the end is arranged with the anode wires in the azimuthal direction, &theta;, which provides information on the radial coordinate, r. To obtain the azimuthal direction, each cathode plane is divided into strips along the radial direction.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background There is an {{increasing}} usage of ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IMMS) in proteomics. IMMS combines the features of ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) and mass spectrometry (MS). It separates and detects peptide ions on a millisecond time-scale. IMS separates peptide ions based on <b>drift</b> <b>time</b> that {{is determined by the}} collision cross-section of each peptide ion in a given experiment condition. A peptide ion's collision cross-section is related to the ion size and shape resulted from the peptide amino acid sequence and their modifications. This inherent relation between the <b>drift</b> <b>time</b> of peptide ion and peptide sequence indicates that the <b>drift</b> <b>time</b> of peptide ions can be used to infer peptide sequence and therefore, for peptide identification. Results This paper describes an artificial neural networks (ANNs) regression model for the prediction of peptide ion <b>drift</b> <b>time</b> in IMMS. Each peptide in this work was represented using three descriptors (i. e., molecular weight, sequence length and a two-dimensional sequence index). An ANN predictor consisting of four input nodes, three hidden nodes and one output node was constructed for peptide ion <b>drift</b> <b>time</b> prediction. For the model training and testing, a 10 -fold cross-validation strategy was employed for three datasets each containing different charge states. Dataset one contains 212 singly-charged peptide ions, dataset two has 306 doubly-charged peptide ions, and dataset three has 77 triply-charged peptide ions. Our proposed method achieved 94. 4 %, 93. 6 % and 74. 2 % prediction accuracy for singly-, doubly- and triply-charged peptide ions, respectively. Conclusions An ANN-based method has been developed for predicting the <b>drift</b> <b>time</b> of peptide ions in IMMS. The results achieved here demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the prediction model. This work can enhance the confidence of protein identification by combining with current database search approaches for protein identification. </p...|$|E

To explore the prospects for such experiments, <b>drift</b> <b>time</b> measurements of 243 Am + and 239 Pu + were performed in an off-line buffer-gas cell. Am and Pu atoms were evaporated from an electrically-heated filament containing both elements and were subsequently ionized by laser resonance ionization [1].

40|$|A {{detailed}} study of charge collection efficiency has been performed on the Silicon Drift Detectors (SDD) of the ALICE experiment. Three different methods to study the collected charge {{as a function of}} the <b>drift</b> <b>time</b> have been implemented. The first approach consists in measuring the charge at different injection distances moving an infrared laser by means of micrometric step motors. The second method is based on the measurement of the charge injected by the laser at fixed drift distance and varying the drift field, thus changing the <b>drift</b> <b>time.</b> In the last method, the measurement of the charge deposited by atmospheric muons is used to study the charge collection efficiency {{as a function of the}} <b>drift</b> <b>time.</b> The three methods gave consistent results and indicated that no charge loss during the drift is observed for the sensor types used in 99 % of the SDD modules mounted on the ALICE Inner Tracking System. The atmospheric muons have also been used to test the effect of the zero-suppression applied to reduce the data size by erasing the counts in cells not passing the thresholds for noise removal. As expected, the zero suppression introduces a dependence of the reconstructed charge as a function of <b>drift</b> <b>time</b> because it cuts the signal in the tails of the electron clouds enlarged by diffusion effects.

40|$|Ion {{mobility}} spectrometry (IMS) is a {{gas phase}} separation technique which relies on differences in collision cross section (CCS) of ions. Ionic clouds of unresolved conformers overlap if the CCS difference {{is below the}} instrumental resolution expressed as CCS/ΔCCS. The experimental arrival time distribution (ATD) peak is then a superimposition of the various contributions weighted by their relative intensities. This paper introduces a strategy for accurate <b>drift</b> <b>time</b> determination using traveling wave ion mobility spectrometry (TWIMS) of poorly resolved or unresolved conformers. This method implements through a calibration procedure {{the link between the}} peak full width at half maximum (FWHM) and the <b>drift</b> <b>time</b> of model compounds for wide range of settings for wave heights and velocities. We modified a Gaussian equation which achieves the deconvolution of ATD peaks where the FWHM is fixed according to our calibration procedure. The new fitting Gaussian equation only depends on two parameters: The apex of the peak (A) and the mean <b>drift</b> <b>time</b> value (μ). The standard deviation parameter (correlated to FWHM) becomes a function of the <b>drift</b> <b>time.</b> This correlation function between μ and FWHM is obtained using the TWIMS calibration procedure which determines the maximum instrumental ion beam diffusion under limited and controlled space charge effect using ionic compounds which are detected as single conformers in the gas phase.
