40|$|At {{the request}} of Fresenius Kabi an {{emulsion}} preparation system was designed with a maximum production capacity of  15 L and minimum of 3 L emulsion. The system was required to consist of one oil-tank, one pre-emulsion tank, two storage tanks and one homogenizer. The storage tanks were positioned on a movable carriage {{on the left side}} of the homogenizer and the pre-emulsion tank and oil tank was placed on a separate <b>frame</b> on the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> of the homogenizer. All tanks were equipped with individual temperature control and a stand-alone parallel cleaning system was designed. The system also had to be optimized for the specific process and extensive calculations were done.   The emulsion system was designed using CAD-software and produced a detailed 3 D-model. The tanks were designed from scratch and all other parts of the system consist of standardized components readily available. A list of the components in the system with manufacturer article number of all components was also produced. Actual drawings for the tanks were also made. The 3 D-model and the list of components provide a good base for future construction of the system...|$|R

50|$|Of {{the three}} {{surviving}} woodcuts on the {{copies of the}} Titus ballad, only one clearly depicts scenes narrated within the ballad. The ballad facsimile in the Roxburghe collection, for instance, shows a crowd watching a homecoming procession of some kind; however, while a homecoming moment is certainly one Titus narrates, nothing in the woodcut distinctly proves that the homecoming is that of Titus Andronicus. Similarly, the woodcut on the Huntington's broadside facsimile illustrates a scene which is delineated as a moment, not from Titus's tale, but from classical epic. This woodcut portrays a duel between two men, and it labels the two men as Hector and Ajax, both characters from Homer's Iliad. One of the woodcuts from the Pepys collection, however, does depict various scenes that are clearly moments from Titus's narrative. This woodcut illustrates three distinct moments from the ballad: 1. In the foreground, the woodcut depicts Titus killing the Queen's sons and draining their blood into a basin that Lavinia holds. Next to Titus's revenge act, the woodcut shows the Moor to the side as having been half-buried, standing up in the ground. 2. In the background, the woodcut illustrates Lavinia writing the names of her rapists/mutilators in the dirt with a stick balanced between the stumps of her arms. 3. And, in a <b>frame</b> on the <b>right</b> <b>side</b> of the woodcut, the broadside displays the Queen and the Emperor about to eat a pie.|$|R
