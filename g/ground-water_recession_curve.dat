40|$|The {{study of}} {{recession}} flows offers fundamental insights into basin hydrological processes and, in particular, into the collective {{behavior of the}} governing dominant subsurface flows and properties. We use here an existing geomorphological interpretation of recession dynamics, which links the exponent in the classic <b>recession</b> <b>curve</b> -dQ / dt = kQα to the geometric properties of the time-varying drainage network to study the general properties of <b>recession</b> <b>curves</b> across {{a wide variety of}} river basins.

40|$|Abstract <b>Recession</b> <b>curves</b> {{of daily}} streamflow hydrographs are {{analysed}} by a probabilistic approach. Flow {{of a day}} on a <b>recession</b> <b>curve</b> is calculated by multiplying the previous day's flow with a value of K smaller than one; K, defined as {{the ratio of the}} flows of successive days on the <b>recession</b> <b>curve,</b> was determined from observed daily flow time series. The range of K is divided into three class intervals. A procedure using the concept of gradually increasing values of K is adopted. For this, transition probabilities and average values of K are determined for each class interval and each month of the year. A <b>recession</b> <b>curve</b> can be generated, once the peak flow is known, by the probabilistic approach. The procedure allows nonlinear, seasonal and stochastic effects in flow recession of a river to be considered.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the signatures of catchment geomorphology on base flow <b>recession</b> <b>curves.</b> Its relevance {{relates to the}} implied predictability of base flow features, which are central to catchment-scale transport processes and to ecohydrological function. Moving from the classical <b>recession</b> <b>curve</b> analysis method, originally applied in the Finger Lakes Region of New York, a large set of <b>recession</b> <b>curves</b> has been analyzed from Swiss streamflow data. For these catchments, digital elevation models have been precisely analyzed and a method aimed at the geomorphic origins of <b>recession</b> <b>curves</b> {{has been applied to}} the Swiss data set. The method links river network morphology, epitomized by time-varying distribution of contributing channel sites, with the classic parameterization of recession events. This is done by assimilating two scaling exponents, β and bG, with |dQ/dt| ∝ Qβ where Q is at-a-station gauged flow rate and N(l) ∝ inline image where l is the downstream distance from the channel heads receding in time, N(l) is the number of draining channel reaches located at distance l from their heads, and G(l) is the total drainage network length at a distance greater or equal to l, the active drainage network. We find that the method provides good results in catchments where drainage density can be regarded as spatially constant. A correction to the method is proposed which accounts for arbitrary local drainage densities affecting the local drainage inflow per unit channel length. Such corrections properly vanish when the drainage density become spatially constant. Overall, definite geomorphic signatures are recognizable for <b>recession</b> <b>curves,</b> with notable theoretical and practical implications...|$|R

40|$|Hydrograph {{analysis}} {{techniques have}} been well developed for hydrographs obtained from streams and springs, where data are cast in terms of total discharge. The data obtained from well hydrographs provide water level versus time; hence, a method of hydrograph analysis is required for situations in which only water level data are available. It is hypothesized here that three segments on a <b>recession</b> <b>curve</b> from wells in a karst aquifer represent drainage from three types of storage: conduit (C), fracture (F), and matrix (M). Hydrographs from several wells in a karst aquifer at the U. S. Department of Energy Oak Ridge Y- 12 Plant are used to estimate the specific yields (S{sub y}) associated with each portion of the aquifer (C, F, M), as well as continuum transmissivities (T). Data from three short injection tests at one well indicate continuum T at this well bore is {approximately} 5 m{sup 2 }/d, and tests at numerous other wells in the aquifer yield results between 1 and 7 M{sup 2 }/d. The T estimated with well hydrographs from two storm events indicates a T of 9. 8 m{sup 2 } 2 /d. Well developed conduit systems in which water levels in wells show a flashy response typically show S{sub y} values of 1 {times} 10 {sup - 4 }, 1 {times} 10 {sup - 3 }, and 3 {times} 10 {sup - 3 }, for C, F, and M.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{becomes part of}} the {{mathematical}} modeling of hydrological processes at the catchment scale. The main objective of this work is {{to examine the relationship between}} the hydrological response of a basin during the recession and its geomorphological characteristics. The <b>recession</b> <b>curves</b> represent the power law relationship between the discharge and the streamflow decline rate -dQ/dt = kQ^b. Recently it has been developed the geomorphological theory of recession hydrological response. The basic idea of this theory is that che power law relationship -dQ/dt = kQ^b originates from the power law relationship between the number of the channel heads of active drainage network (ADN) N(t) and its total length G(t) at time t. This study contributes to the validation of the geomorphological recession theory. The thesis work actually started from the examination of the catchment morphological properties obtained wid GIS tools, with the purpose to analyze the recessions of some mountain basins (Vermigliana, Fersina creeks). This analysis was carried out following the approach proposed by[Brutsaert and Nieber, 1977]. For one of test cases the spatial interpolation of precipitations was performed in order to examine eventual dependencies of the <b>recession</b> <b>curve</b> parameters on the heterogeneous spatial distribution of precipitations. Then, several numerical experiments were carried out in order to understand the dynamics of active drainage networks during the recession phase and to evaluate experimentally the factors of the links between "traditional" and "geomorphological" <b>recession</b> <b>curves</b> and relative parameters. The tool adopted in this work is the distributed hydrological model CATchment HYdrology (CATHY), which couples the subsurface flow in porous media with the surface flow. This model was applied to both a synthetic catchment (V-catchment) and some natural basins. The thesis work had positive feedback on some of the assumptions relative to <b>recession</b> <b>curves.</b> Also, the dependence of the <b>recession</b> <b>curve</b> parameters on the heterogeneity of the spatial rainfall distribution was investigated. The modeling of dynamic active drainage network with CATHY showed that the relationship between the flow rate and the ADN length is a power law with exponents less than one. The flow rate per unit length is variable in time, with a tendency to the stabilization for a long recession times. This finding is significant as the recent theory implies the constant flow rate per unit length. The simulated discharge drained into ADN is closed to the simulated discharge at the basin outlet. Therefore, it allows as to deduce that the method of analysis adopted in the present work is suitable tool for understanding of the complexity of the processes that determine the recession hydrologic response at the catchment scale. The obtained results will allow the improvements in the analysis of the relationships between geomorphological catchment properties and recession response processes...|$|R

40|$|Storage {{of water}} within a river basin is often {{estimated}} by analyzing <b>recession</b> flow <b>curves</b> as it cannot be `instantly' estimated {{with the aid}} of available technologies. In this study we explicitly deal with the issue of estimation of `drainable' storage, which is equal to the area under the `complete' <b>recession</b> flow <b>curve</b> (i. e. a discharge vs. time curve where discharge continuously decreases till it approaches zero). But a major challenge in this regard is that <b>recession</b> <b>curves</b> are rarely `complete' due to short inter-storm time intervals. Therefore, it is essential to analyze and model recession flows meaningfully. We adopt the wellknown Brutsaert and Nieber analytical method that expresses time derivative of discharge (dQ/dt) as a power law function of Q : -dQ/dt = kQ(alpha). However, the problem with dQ/dt-Q analysis {{is that it is not}} suitable for late recession flows. Traditional studies often compute alpha considering early recession flows and assume that its value is constant for the whole recession event. But this approach gives unrealistic results when alpha >= 2, a common case. We address this issue here by using the recently proposed geomorphological recession flow model (GRFM) that exploits the dynamics of active drainage networks. According to the model, alpha is close to 2 for early recession flows and 0 for late recession flows. We then derive a simple expression for drainable storage in terms the power law coefficient k, obtained by considering early recession flows only, and basin area. Using 121 complete <b>recession</b> <b>curves</b> from 27 USGS basins we show that predicted drainable storage matches well with observed drainable storage, indicating that the model can also reliably estimate drainable storage for `incomplete' recession events to address many challenges related to water resources.

The long-term mean daily stream-flow records of Al-Khazir River (1969 – 1981) were used to estimate groundwater discharge by base-flow hydrograph separation and displacement <b>recession</b> <b>curve</b> methods. Four base-flow separation methods were used; one is the graphical separation method, and three are automated separation methods included in the web-based Hydrograph Analysis Tool. The annual recharge estimated by WTF was 111. 6 mm/y, and the average annual recharge estimated by the four base-flow separation methods was 125. 8 mm/y. Estimating recharge by the water table fluctuation method does not incorporate spatial variability contained in the whole watershed, because the specific yield did not represent the entire basin. However, the hydrograph analysis method can give a comprehensive estimation of the net integrated recharge for the entire watershed, which includes different recharge mechanisms. The displacement <b>recession</b> <b>curve</b> method deviates a lot (> 30 mm/y) from the other methods, which indicates that this method may not be suitable to apply in such large watersheds...|$|R

40|$|Currently, {{sampling}} regimes rely on predetermined time or flow-weighted intervals {{at which}} to collect samples. During periods of high flow, such as storm events, automated samplers may {{run out of}} sample bottles {{before the end of}} the hydrograph, resulting in the loss of data and inaccurate load calculations. In this research, real-time monitoring sensor networks with automated samplers were used to monitor the flowrate in agricultural tile-drains and ditches. By characterizing site specific hydrographs, a model was developed that enabled the datalogger to create storm-specific sampling regimes, resulting in approximately 20 samples for each storm event that resulted in a significant hydrograph. The model uses a power-law relationship for defining each hydrograph’s <b>recession</b> <b>curve</b> and spaces sampling events at flow-weighted intervals over the expected recession. The model’s performance was found to be satisfactory when either average or best-fit values of the two model parameters were used to predict the <b>recession</b> <b>curves.</b> The average error in the cumulative flow represented by each recession sample in the six hydrographs analyzed was less than 10 %. The use of this model to create a storm-specific sampling regime eliminated the uncertainty in determining the flow-weighted sampling interval and led to the optimal usage of the sample bottles available in the automated sampler. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} it is {{shown that the}} annual runoff series of those Italian basins, for which the {{variation}} in storage volume {{from one year to}} the next is negligible are appropriately represented as an essentially uncorrelated white noise process. For basins with non negligible contributions from deep aquifers, a correlated AR(1) component added to the white noise gives an ARMA (1, 1) process. The cubic root transformation simulateously achieves normality and constant varince of the series. Therefore for ungauged rivers, to identify the white noise component it is sufficient to estimate the mean annual runoff, while the AR(1) component may be identified from the flow <b>recession</b> <b>curve.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop a model procedure for predicting low flows for a large set of gauged basins located in the Rhine-Meuse area. The methodology is primarily based on the analysis of <b>recession</b> <b>curves,</b> river discharges being essentially provided by groundwater flow during drought period. Our objective is to use recession coefficients in order to calibrate base flow predictions coming out from a groundwater reservoir. Problems related to the temporal variability of recession coefficients are discussed. We come to the conclusion that lows flows prediction can be improved by implementing a new groundwater reservoir into the RR model based on our knowledge of low flow processes...|$|R
40|$|In {{hydrology}} {{the term}} »low-flows« indicates a flow which is followed after {{longer periods of}} dry weather. As such low flows are {{an essential part of}} any stream flow regime and their understanding {{is an important part of}} effective water management. In this graduate thesis we presented an overview of main low-flow indices, such as low-flow statistics, base flow index, <b>recession</b> <b>curve</b> and stream flow deficit analysis, flow duration curve and seasonality indices such as seasonality index and ratio. The calculations of analysed indices were carried out in a software environment R inside a package for low-flow analysis lfstat. The indices were calculated on a case study of the Kokra I gauging station in order to explain the low-flow regime of the Kokra river. Appropriate initial parameters were set when analysing stream flow deficit and the <b>recession</b> <b>curve.</b> Flow duration curves were drawn on a yearly basis as well as separately for different seasons. In seasonality analysis the winter regime of lowflows was found to be the case for the Kokra river based on seasonality ratio and index values. Furthermore the analysis of low flows was expanded on another 55 gauging stations across Slovenia with each one of them being assigned the stream flow regime. Stream flows were compared based on calculated statistics, such as QMF, Q 70, Q 90, Q 95, MAM 1 and MAM 7, base flow index, seasonality index and ratio and different indices of recession analysis and stream flow deficit analysis. The correlation of the calculated indices was analysed and graphical presentations of seasonality indices were made...|$|R
