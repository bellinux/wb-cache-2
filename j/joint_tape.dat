50|$|Mudding {{is usually}} done in three layers {{and it is}} {{important}} to use the correct type of mud for the first and last layer though a multi-purpose compound may be adequate for all coats: Bedding coat or taping coat where the mud is applied to seams and corners and paper <b>joint</b> <b>tape</b> is pressed into the mud (if using a fiberglass mesh tape the self-adhering tape is applied to the joints first and the mud pressed through the tape). The mud used here needs to adhere well and be strong and is called a taping compound; filler coat where the tape is covered and roughly smoothed; and the finish coat or topping coat which is very smooth. A topping compound is soft, smooth and easy to sand. Some sanding of the finish coat is usually required to get a smooth surface. Sheets of drywall usually have tapered edges to provide space for the thickness of the tape and mud at the seams.|$|E
30|$|No {{previous}} studies have clarified {{the role of the}} scapula in sprint running. Noninvasively, mechanical and physiologic roles of a partial body position can be examined according to acute reduction by using <b>joint</b> <b>taping</b> (Koyama et al. 2014), a gripping tool (Grant et al. 2003; Wdowski and Gittoes 2013), or hypothermic anesthesia (Meyer et al. 2004). Many polyarticular muscles are attached around the shoulder joint, which is proximally located relative to the hand and foot. Therefore, based on the available methods, scapulothoracic <b>joint</b> <b>taping</b> can be considered the best valid method to restrict scapular behavior of the runner, and we compared the kinematics in first accelerated running between the scapula constrained condition and normal condition.|$|R

INTRODUCTION: Ankle injuries are amongst the most common injuries sustained by sports people. There are various methods of treatment. The practice of prophylactic ankle taping in reducing the incidence of ankle injury and preventing re-injury is controversial.

50|$|Taping {{can also}} help relieve pain in the shoulder. According to the {{textbook}} “Essentials of athletic injury management” by prentice and Arnheim, Athletic tape helps to alleviate pain by increasing circulation to affected area, provide support, provides a means for stabilizing the arm, and allows for pressure reduction. When pain is cause from it being in a constant raise position. A technique where tape is applied to drop the shoulder {{can be used to}} get rid of the pain and strain by adding more space in the joint. For example, for the acromioclavicular <b>joint</b> <b>taping</b> can be applied to relieve pain in the top of the shoulder from a collision or as a result of the joint becoming separated because of damage to ligament. The way the shoulder is positioned can cause pain and retracting the shoulder by tapping can relieve the pain. See figure 3 for an illustration on shoulder tapping.|$|R

This setting has far less shrinkage than the air-dry compounds normally used in drywall, so it only requires one coat. Blueboard also has square edges rather than the tapered-edge drywall boards. The tapered drywall boards are used to countersink the <b>tape</b> in <b>taped</b> <b>jointing</b> whereas the <b>tape</b> in veneer plastering is buried beneath a level surface.

40|$|Abstract This study {{aimed to}} examine the effects of {{different}} taping pressures with or without external force on the maximum dorsal flexion angle (DFA). Twenty-two healthy male university students with> 5 years of athletic experience participated. A qualified trainer wound a rigid tape thrice around subject’s wrist <b>joint.</b> <b>Taping</b> pressure was measured using the pressure measuring system AMI 3037 -SB. Independent variables were five experimental conditions (5 hPa, 30 hPa, 60 hPa, and 90 hPa, and control) and two measurement conditions for the wrist joint DFA with non-external and external forces. In the former, the subject flexed the wrist joint himself (active DFA), while in the latter, a trainer helped in flexion (passive DFA). The dependent variable was the maximum DFA. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA (taping pressure × different DFA measurement) and multiple comparison tests showed that passive DFA was significantly larger than active DFA under all taping pressure conditions. Active DFA was smaller under 30 -hPa condition than under the 5 -hPa condition, and was smaller under 60 -hPa conditions than under control and 5 -hPa conditions, and was smaller under 90 -hPa condition than under the other conditions. Passive DFA was smaller under 30 - and 60 -hPa conditions than under control and 5 -hPa conditions, and was smaller under 90 -hPa condition than under control, 5 -, and 30 -hPa conditions.

40|$|The <b>joint</b> process between <b>tapes</b> of coated {{conductors}} is {{a critical}} issue for {{the most of the}} applications of high temperature superconductors (HTS). Using different fabrication techniques joints of YBCO coated superconductors were prepared and characterized through electrical measurements. For soldering material low melting point eutectic alloys, such as In-Sn (m. p. 116 degrees C) and Sn-Pb (m. p. 189 degrees C) were selected to prepare lap joints with effective length between 1 to 20 cm. The splice resistance and the critical current of the joints were evaluated by I-V curve measurements with the maximum current strength above the critical current, in order to evaluate the degree of degradation for each joint method. Pressed lap <b>joints</b> prepared with <b>tapes</b> without external reinforcement presented low resistance lap joint nevertheless some critical current degradation occurs when strong pressing is applied. When mechanical pressure is applied during the soldering process we can reduce the thickness of the solder alloy and a residual resistance arises from contributions of high resistivity matrix and external reinforcement. The lap <b>joints</b> for reinforced <b>tape</b> were prepared using two methods: the first, using ""as-supplied"" tape and the other after reinforcement-removal; in the latter case, the tapes were resoldered using Sn-Pb alloy. The results using several joint geometries, distinct surface preparation processes and different soldering materials are presented and analysed.

40|$|Background and Purpose. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of patellar taping on the onset of activity of the vastus medialis obliquus muscle (VMO) and the vastus lateralis muscle (VL). Subjects and Methods. Fourteen female subjects with patellar pain walked up and down stairs in two conditions: (1) with the patellofemoral joint of the painful lower extremity taped so that the pain was reduced by at least 50 % on a pain provocation test and (2) without patellar taping. Results. When the patellofemoral <b>joint</b> was not <b>taped,</b> there was no difference in the onset of activity between the VMO and the VL during the step-up and step-down tasks. During the step-up task, the onset of VMO activity occurred earlier with taping but there was no change in the onset of VL activity with taping. During the step-down task, the onset of VMO activity occurred earlier and the onset of VL activity was delayed with taping. When the patellofemoral <b>joint</b> was <b>taped,</b> the VMO was activated earlier than the VL during the step-up and step-down tasks. Conclusion and Discussion. Taping of the patellofemoral joint in the manner used in this study changed the timing of VMO and VL activity in subjects with patellofemoral pain during step-up and step-down tasks. The earlier activation of the VMO may alter the movement of the patella, and further research is needed to determine whether this occurs and whether it is beneficial...|$|R
