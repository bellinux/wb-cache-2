50|$|Economic {{diversification}} may {{be delayed}} or neglected {{by the authorities}} {{in the light of}} the temporarily high profits that can be obtained from limited natural resources. The attempts at diversification that do occur are often grand public works projects which may be misguided or mismanaged. However, even when the authorities attempt diversification in the economy, this is made difficult because resource extraction is vastly more lucrative and out-competes other industries. Successful natural-resource-exporting countries often become increasingly dependent on extractive industries over time. The abundant revenue from natural resource extraction discourages the long-term investment in infrastructure that would support a more diverse economy. This lack of investment exacerbates the negative impact of sudden drops in the resource's price. While resource sectors tend to produce large <b>financial</b> <b>revenues,</b> they often add few jobs to the economy, and tend to operate as enclaves with few forward and backward connections to the rest of the economy.|$|E
