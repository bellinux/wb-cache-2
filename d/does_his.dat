5|$|The melodic lines' wide {{leaps and}} arpeggios are not {{far removed from}} those in the Short Symphony, written 30 years earlier, and the {{prevalence}} of the interval of the minor ninth hearkens back to his Orchestral Variations, as <b>does</b> <b>his</b> use of alternating fast and slow sections.|$|E

5|$|Offa's Dyke, most {{of which}} was {{probably}} built in his reign, is a testimony to the extensive resources Offa had at his command {{and his ability to}} organise them. Other surviving sources include a problematic document known as the Tribal Hidage, which may provide further evidence of Offa's scope as a ruler, though its attribution to his reign is disputed. A significant corpus of letters dates from the period, especially from Alcuin, an English deacon and scholar who spent over a decade at Charlemagne's court as one of his chief advisors, and corresponded with kings, nobles and ecclesiastics throughout England. These letters in particular reveal Offa's relations with the continent, as <b>does</b> <b>his</b> coinage, which was based on Carolingian examples.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} {{had trouble}} with the censors over several segments in this episode. The opening segment of the episode, which features a Fox censor named Fox Censor (pictured on the left) being stabbed to death, was pitched by David Mirkin and {{had a difficult time}} getting through the real-life censors. They had issues with the size of the knife and the sound effects used. Originally, the TV-rating was supposed to stab Censor with a dagger, but Fox objected because it was too gruesome and was changed to a cutlass. The censors also objected to an unaired scene where Homer <b>does</b> <b>his</b> naked church dance on an altar. The scene was reanimated so that Homer was dancing naked in the front row.|$|E

5|$|In the 1998 storyline {{where he}} fakes dissociative {{identity}} disorder (split personalities) to avoid a prison sentence for hostage and threat charges, he is given four personalities that represent his core being: A childlike personality named Tom, Italian playboy Rod, parental figure Miss Perkins, and the abusive Pete (the personality responsible for his worst misdeeds). The revelation that he is faking the personalities devastates Viki, who had actually suffered from the disorder; it also brings out remorse in Todd, and causes him to reflect on his mistakes. The storyline ends with the implication that the personalities {{may not have been}} as fabricated as Todd believed them to be. The writers also made it so that his difficulties are manifested in his nightmares, which give him insomnia and are designed as a look into his psyche; at multiple points within the series, TÃ©a attempts to help Todd by encouraging him to open up to her about them, which he eventually <b>does.</b> <b>His</b> opinions on his enemies are conveyed clearly; he remains one step ahead of them, and consistently out-smarts police, family, and others he targets, sometimes using weapons.|$|E
