40|$|ABSTRACT: The energy {{absorption}} of an aluminum foam sandwich structure and a conventional polymer foam sandwich structure is similar for impacts ranging from 5 to 25 J. The polymer <b>foam-based</b> samples exhibit localized {{damage in the}} form of skin fracture and core crushing, but with negligible permanent out-of-plane deformation.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a number of}} novel active fasteners developed to significantly lower disassembly costs during reconditioning, remanufacturing, and recycling of products. In the initial stage of the fastener development process, the applicability of distinct trigger signals for active disassembly (AD) is evaluated. Based on this evaluation, the high robustness of using a pressure increase or decrease as a nondestructive trigger for AD is demonstrated. Since previously proposed pressure-sensitive fasteners face considerable drawbacks upon implementation in electronic products due to the ongoing trend of miniaturization, a second generation of pressure-based active fasteners is developed. Evaluation of these fasteners by means of axiomatic design techniques and prototyping demonstrates that the presented snap-fits, which make use of a closed-cell elastomer foam, are most robust. Subsequently, the contraction forces that closed-celled foams can exert {{as a function of}} an increase in ambient air pressure are experimentally determined. Furthermore, the implementation of pressure-sensitive <b>foam-based</b> snap-fits in both a modem and a payment terminal is described.

40|$|From the {{beginning}} of the early 1960 s helicopter seats underwent a deep evolution. They {{play a key role in}} survivability during emergency landings. The rotorcraft structure must be, in fact, designed to give to each occupant every reasonable chance of avoiding severe injury in crash landings. To reach this result several improvements in the design of crashworthy seats with special emphasis on the energy absorption systems were introduced during development of rotorcrafts. This paper, based on previous experiments on carbon foam modelling under high strain rate evolution, will show their potential application for an energy absorption system based on a constant load response. This solution would allow easy manufacturing, lightweight structures, as well as possible further development into variable load energy absorbers.

30|$|The extreme {{heterogeneity}} of carbonate reservoirs {{in the form}} of fracture corridors and super-permeability thief zones present challenges to the efficient sweep of oil in both secondary and tertiary recovery operations. In such reservoirs, conformance control is crucial to ensure injected water and any EOR chemicals optimally contact the remaining oil with minimal throughput. <b>Foam-based</b> conformance control is a relatively new technology especially its use for deep diversion in high-salinity and high-temperature conditions. In this work, a laboratory study was conducted to develop and evaluate a <b>foam-based</b> conformance control technology for application in a high-salinity and high-temperature carbonate. Foaming agents (surfactants) were first screened for their suitability with regard to reservoir temperature and salinity where properties such as foamability and foam stability were measured. The best performing surfactants were then used to study the foam-induced mobility reduction across a core composite. The experiments were conducted at reservoir conditions. Foam stability and decay were also investigated in those permeability reduction experiments. Brine and crude oil were injected after foam formation where observed pressure drops allowed quantification of foam stability and decay; hence, the sustainability of mobility reduction. Finally, the potential improvement in reservoir contact and hence oil recovery were examined by oil displacement experiments conducted in specially prepared heterogeneous composites. For the studied conditions of high salinity and high temperature, foaming agents of the amphoteric family as well as one manufacturer proprietary surfactants blend were found suitable in terms of salt tolerance and foam stability. Using the proprietary blend and without oil in core, the generated foam reduced fluids mobility by a factor of 12. The attained mobility reduction was lower in presence of oil but was still acceptable for flow diversion purposes. Using the proprietary blend and with oil in core, the generated foam reduced fluids mobility by a factor of 6 (compared to 12 without oil in core). Oil recovery improvement with foam placement was also found to be significant. These results demonstrate the potential of foams for carbonates with harsh salinity and temperature conditions.|$|E
