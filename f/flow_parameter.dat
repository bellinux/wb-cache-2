However MFI takes no account of the shear, shear rate or shear history and as such is not a good measure of the processing window of a polymer. It is a single-point viscosity measurement at a relatively low shear rate and temperature. Earlier, it was often said that MFI give a ‘dot’ when actually what is needed is a ‘plot’ for the polymer processors. However, this is not true now because of a unique approach developed for estimating the rheogram merely from the knowledge of the MFI.|$|E

It provides software setups with appropriate default systems for different countries, allows the users to prepare customised software setups, provides a sensitivity analysis facility to allow {{testing of the}} effect of variations in values of various key parameters, and describes various calibration techniques (including survey methods) in the User Guide. In particular, the US HCM (Customary and Metric) software setups of SIDRA INTERSECTION are calibrated using model parameters based on the US Highway Capacity Manual (see the section titled [...] Highway Capacity Manual). Among many model parameters, the saturation <b>flow</b> <b>parameter</b> for signalized intersections and the critical gap and follow-up headway parameters for unsignalised roundabouts and sign-controlled intersections [...] are identified as key parameters for calibration to match real-life traffic conditions.

The results indicate that the <b>flow</b> <b>parameters</b> affect the probability of fracture of a gas turbine disk since they can change the distribution of stress and temperature of the disk. The failure probability of the disk rises with increasing rotation Reynolds number and Chebyshev number, but descends with increasing inlet Reynolds number. In addition, a sampling based sensitivity analysis with finite difference method is conducted to determine the sensitivities of the safety with respect to the <b>flow</b> <b>parameters.</b> The sensitivity estimates show that the rotation Reynolds number is the dominant variable in safety analysis of a rotor-stator cavity among the <b>flow</b> <b>parameters...</b>|$|R

In the range pT 3 GeV/c, v 3 (PP) is found to be about 50 – 75 % of v 2 (PP) and for pT > 3 GeV/c the two anisotropy parameters become comparable. The value of v 3 is driven by local density fluctuations both directly via the creation of triangular geometry and indirectly via additional flow. As expected, the triangular <b>flow</b> <b>parameter</b> calculated {{with respect to the}} reaction plane v 3 (RP) is found to be close to zero. We show that v 3 (PP) strongly depends on the spatial size of fluctuations, especially in the higher pT (3 GeV/c) region where a larger value of σ results in a smaller v 3 (PP).
