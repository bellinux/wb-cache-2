5|$|This {{was by far}} {{the biggest}} {{challenge}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> taken on in my career, and I could not be more honored {{to be a part of}} such an amazing and historical event. Nothing could ever come close to working with Madonna on this Super Bowl performance, her attention to detail and commitment to all of her projects is truly inspiring and life changing.|$|E
5|$|He gave a {{magnificent}} speech. He {{is one of}} the cleverest speakers <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> heard. The questions on the Mundt-Nixon bill, his views on the loyalty oath, and the problem of international communism were just what he was waiting for. Indeed, he was so skillful—and, I might add, cagey—that those who came indifferent were sold, and even many of those who came to heckle went away with doubts... If he is only a fraction as effective as he was here you have a formidable opponent on your hands.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the best}} sermons <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> been privileged to hear was by the late Bishop of Winchester. Social exclusion? He said {{virtually}} that if one sheep from a flock of 100 goes missing, the good shepherd worries frantically about that single sheep until it is safely found. There are too many sheep, men, women and children, being marginalised. John the Baptist had the answer: why do we not? I remain concerned in these turbulent times, but {{thank you for your}} patience. It has been my privilege to be able to speak in your Lordships' House.|$|E

60|$|My under-study looked troubled,--more troubled than <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> {{seen him}} before.|$|R
60|$|I {{was obliged}} to say that I did not think <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> heard it.|$|R
5|$|That {{first night}} of my {{imprisonment}} was the longest night <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> passed in my life; {{it seemed as though}} the dawn of day would never come. I found in my bag a small Book of Common Prayer according to the ritual of the Episcopal Church. It was a great comfort to me, and before retiring to rest Mrs. Clark and I spent a few minutes in the devotions appropriate to the evening. Here, perhaps, I may say, that although I had been a regular attendant on the Presbyterian worship since my childhood, a constant contributor to all the missionary societies, and had helped to build their churches and ornament the walls, giving my time and my musical ability freely to make their meetings attractive to my people, yet none of these pious church members or clergymen remembered me in my prison. To this (Christian ?) conduct I contrast that of the Anglican bishop, Rt. Rev. Alfred Willis, who visited me {{from time to time in}} my house, and in whose church I have since been confirmed as a communicant. But he was not allowed to see me at the palace.|$|E
25|$|At Brisbane, on a wicket {{that was}} the worst that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> seen, the Yorkshireman was superb. The head-high bouncer was safely ignored. The chest-high {{deliveries}} of both the pace men and the spinners were played safely to the ground, {{out of the way of}} the many grasping hands in the leg-trap, and Hutton's display was a perfect lesson in the art of batsmanship...that will long remain in my memory, being by far the best innings <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> seen played.|$|E
25|$|The {{movie is}} 126 minutes long, and I {{would guess that}} at least 100 of those minutes, maybe more, are {{concerned}} specifically and graphically with {{the details of the}} torture and death of Jesus. This is the most violent film <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> seen.|$|E
60|$|But neither father nor {{mother could}} {{remember}} that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> seen a magic lantern.|$|R
60|$|I {{reminded}} the gentleman {{that this was}} the first <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> heard of the lady's death.|$|R
60|$|That was {{the first}} time <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> seen Wright come into Hoden's. He called for tobacco.|$|R
25|$|Stallard had {{the most}} {{abrasive}} nature that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> met. He could never believe {{that he could have}} a bad idea or make a bad decision. And sometimes he'd go berserk with those who disagreed with him. He didn't have, let us say, the delicacies of negotiation.|$|E
25|$|In 1915, {{while she}} was living with her parents, the {{superintendent}} of city schools of Marion, Ohio wrote that {{she is one of}} the best qualified art teachers <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> known. She teaches art in a manner that arouses and develops the child’s observation and enlarges his aesthetic nature.|$|E
25|$|Ted Dexter {{elected to}} {{lead from the}} front. We had a {{disastrous}} start, with Charlie Griffith blasting out both our openers very cheaply, and Ted unleashing one of his finest displays of controlled aggression <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> witnessed. His 70 was electrifying. He stood up and hit the quick bowlers all over the show for an hour.|$|E
60|$|Bickley murmured {{something}} about force of habit, and looked smaller than <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> seen him do before.|$|R
60|$|We sat {{in silence}} for some minutes, Holmes more {{depressed}} and shaken than <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> seen him.|$|R
60|$|It was a ruby, {{the most}} {{beautiful}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> seen, and about the bigness of a pigeon's egg.|$|R
25|$|In one {{department}} {{however the}} 1974–75 combination excelled any other that I have seen. They {{were the best}} fielding combination <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> witnessed on the cricket field... everyone chased like demons, caught like angels, and, unfortunately, occasionally swore like troopers. Looking back at the Perth Test , I still {{find it difficult to}} believe that some of the catches that were taken were even in the bounds of possibility.|$|E
25|$|I am {{genuinely}} humbled to be {{lifting the}} award {{when there are}} so many other players I have either played with or against that would have been extremely worthy recipients. To receive an award from a panel representing all the key football figures in the game, including the Professional Footballers' Association, the League Managers Association and the media is one of the highest accolades <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> had.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, {{her work}} Everyone <b>I</b> <b>Have</b> <b>Ever</b> Slept With 1963–1995, a tent appliquéd {{with the names}} of {{everyone}} the artist had ever shared a bed with was shown at Charles Saatchi's Sensation exhibition held at the Royal Academy in London. The same year, she gained considerable media exposure when she swore repeatedly in a state of drunkenness on a live discussion programme called The Death of Painting on British television.|$|E
60|$|Mother Anastasia {{was more}} {{animated}} than <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> seen her before {{when in the}} uniform of the house.|$|R
6000|$|... "Auguste! cher Auguste!" [...] exclaimed {{the lovely}} Chatterissa, in the prettiest Parisian accent <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> heard--"Pour moi!" ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was some}} semi-public place of opulent entertainment; and far surpassed any {{thing of the}} kind <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> seen before.|$|R
25|$|Cause of {{the dead}} Brisbane wicket when Australia batted was the drought which had been {{suffered}} in Queensland {{for such a long}} period...People who were praying for water were among those to give the tourists a tremendous Brisbane welcome. Rain had fallen in every match in which the Englishmen had played and the record was maintained {{until the end of the}} tour, and the Test storm at Brisbane, the second of the match, was the worst <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> witnessed.|$|E
25|$|As far as Lange is concerned, he was {{the biggest}} murderer <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> known. To {{write a book about}} him would {{definitely}} not be enough. As he is dead, it is no use talking about him. I would, however, mention {{that he was one of}} the most notorious anti-Semites in the 20th century. He hated Jews so much that he could not look at them; one never wanted to pass him either in the motor pool or anywhere else.|$|E
25|$|Its {{purpose is}} to plant the seeds of devilment and trouble-breeding {{in the days to}} come in the mind and heart of every American Negro.... It is the dirtiest, filthiest, lousiest, most obscene piece of writing that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> seen in print. I would hate to have a son or {{daughter}} of mine permitted to read it; it is so filthy and so dirty. But it comes from a Negro, and you cannot expect any better from a person of his type.|$|E
60|$|Her {{lips parted}} slowly, and she laughed--a bitter, hysterical laugh, {{which seemed to}} me the most awful sound <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> heard.|$|R
60|$|I could {{but thank}} him for the present, which was of more value than {{anything}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> owned in my life.|$|R
60|$|It was {{the longest}} speech <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> heard the man make, {{and it seemed to}} impress Bill. He was quite humble.|$|R
25|$|The First Test was, I {{honestly}} think, the dullest {{and most}} depressing <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> watched...Even at this range of time one finds the gorge rising at the recollection {{of a piece}} of cricket for which there was no tactical or technical justification whatever. Did England think the pitch was going to go? Did they hope to bat out a draw? The answer is that the pitch at the end was perfect, and Australia's eight wicket win was gained with a day and a bit to spare.|$|E
25|$|Bing Crosby {{served as}} an honorary {{director}} of the festival from 1949 to 1951. Charles Laughton visited in 1961, saying “I have just seen the four best productions of Shakespeare that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> seen in my life.” Laughton begged to play King Lear, but died in 1962 before he could fulfill the dream. Hollywood gossip columnist Hedda Hopper visited in 1962, attending two plays. Stacy Keach was a cast member in 1962 and 1963. Duke Ellington and his orchestra presented a benefit concert in 1966 that brought many luminaries to Ashland.|$|E
25|$|The {{audience}} {{broke into}} applause... John Philip Sousa : ', {{that is a}} band. This {{is the first time}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> heard music with any soul to it produced by a mechanical talking machine'... The new instrument is a feat of mathematics and physics. It is not the result of innumerable experiments, but was worked out on paper in advance of being built in the laboratory... The new machine has a range of from 100 to 5,000 , or five and a half octaves... The 'phonograph tone' is eliminated by the new recording and reproducing process.|$|E
60|$|More {{agitated}} for {{a moment}} than <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> seen her, she took her hands from me, and moved a step back.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'm sure,' {{said the}} Good Sport, languishingly, like a sentimental siege-gun, 'that if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> met Mr Chalmers before <b>I</b> shouldn't <b>have</b> {{forgotten}} him.' ...|$|R
60|$|The {{difficult}} breathing, haggard countenance, {{and broken}} utterance {{of my father}} struck me with awe. This was the first death-bed by which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> stood; and the admonishing picture of time passing into eternity was indelibly stamped on my memory. It {{was not only a}} death-bed scene, but it was a family death-bed scene. I know not how it was, but I thought my ancestor looked more like the Goldencalfs than <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> seen him look before.|$|R
