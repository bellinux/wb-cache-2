Kecal agrees, and rushes off to prepare the contract.

Wagner's autobiography 'Mein Leben', circulated amongst his friends (and published openly in 1911), contains constant sniping at Meyerbeer and concludes with Wagner receiving the news of Meyerbeer's death, and his companions' gratification at the news.

Betjeman, a champion of Victorian Gothic Revival architecture, was an early admirer of Burges. In 1957 the Tower House had featured in the fifth episode of his BBC television series, An Englishman's Castle. In a radio interview of 1952 about Cardiff Castle Betjeman spoke of the architect and his foremost work: [...] "a great brain has made this place.

That week, there was no number 1 hit in Britain, according to Lydon, et al. in The Filth and The Fury; the top spot was empty, because so many radio stations, the BBC, and individuals protested the song's content.

500|$|Lemmings {{has also}} been called a {{predecessor}} of the modern real-time strategy (RTS) video game genre. A 1991 Amiga Power article claimed that Lemmings [...] "was the first major game to introduce the 'indirect-control' concept," [...] an element that is now common in many RTS games. Blizzard Entertainment developer Bob Fitch said {{that part of the}} inspiration for the first Warcraft game, , was based on developing a competitive multiplayer RTS that combined elements of The Lost Vikings (which he had worked on) and Lemmings; Fitch said [...] "We just went, 'Oh it's so cool when you see lots of Lemmings all over the place. Why don't we have lots of Vikings all over instead, and then the Vikings can fight each other." [...] Lemmings introduction of RTS elements has been noted by fantasy author Terry Pratchett; in his novel Interesting Times, an army of golems is controlled in a fashion reminiscent of the Lemmings user interface. When readers asked if this was deliberate, Pratchett responded: [...] "Merely because the red army can fight, dig, march and climb and is controlled by little icons?

Barry Garron of The Hollywood Reporter said that the pilot was [...] "so cleverly constructed, the hero so engaging and complicated and the story so filled with great dialogue that I wonder <b>how</b> <b>anyone</b> can sustain this level of accomplishment." [...] He said that the protagonist [...] "has all the sass, strength, resolve and ingenuity of any of literature's classic detectives [...] and Bell is so convincing in the role that it all somehow makes perfect sense." [...] He praised the pilot and Thomas' writing, saying it had [...] "comedy, deathly serious drama, parody and danger, ingredients not typically mixed together", and said that [...] "if future episodes are half as good, this still will be one of TV's bright spots". Kay McFadden of The Seattle Times felt that Veronica Mars was the best new series on UPN, and that the title character was potentially [...] "this season's most interesting character creation".

500|$|While {{establishing}} {{herself as}} an artist and working her way up through the New York underground club scene, Gaga released her debut studio album, The Fame. Speaking about the title and concept of the album, Gaga explained: [...] "The Fame is about <b>how</b> <b>anyone</b> can feel famous. [...] Pop culture is art. It doesn't make you cool to hate pop culture, so I embraced it and you hear it all over The Fame. But, it's a sharable fame. I want to invite you all to the party.

[...] Gaga stated in an interview with MTV UK that she had been working on the album {{for two and a half}} years and completed half of it during the first week of January 2008. As well as writing the lyrics, Gaga worked on the melodies and synth work of the album, with record producer RedOne. According to Gaga, the first track [...] "Just Dance" [...] is a joyous, heart-themed song, which appeals to people going through tough times in their life. [...] "LoveGame", the second track, was inspired by Gaga's sexual crush on a stranger in a night club to whom she said, [...] "I wanna ride on your disco stick". It was written in four minutes based on the disco stick hook. [...] "Paparazzi" [...] has been interpreted with different meanings. However Gaga explained in an interview with About.com, that the song was inspired by her struggles and hunger for fame and love. Essentially a love song, [...] "Paparazzi" [...] dealt with enticing the media and asked the question, whether one can have both fame and love.|$|E

50|$|An {{injection}} of promicin has a 50% chance of either killing the person taking the injection (by way of an aneurysm) or {{giving them a}} 4400 ability. In the fourth season, Dr. Burkhoff claims to have discovered how promicin interacts with the body, thus being able to predict whether a person will survive the shot or not. It is explained that {{nine out of ten}} left-handed people who take the shot survive. In the brain there is a small part called the corpus callosum. It is essentially a bundle of neural fibres that connects the two hemispheres and it is usually slightly larger in left-handed people than it is in right-handed people. That is why left-handed people survive; the size of that part of the brain helps determine whether or not a person will be able to integrate a new neurotransmitter. With further research, Dr. Burkhoff believes a simple CAT scan will be able to tell <b>how</b> <b>anyone's</b> body will react to a promicin shot.|$|R
