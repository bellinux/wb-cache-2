5|$|Since {{the race}} was {{abandoned}} after twelve total laps, it did not reach official status; IndyCar does not consider a race official unless it reaches the halfway mark. As such, no points were awarded and the series championship went to Franchitti by default. If the race had continued and reached official status, Franchitti {{would have been the}} series champion anyway as he had avoided the accident. Power's car, meanwhile, was heavily damaged <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lap</b> 11 crash {{to the point where he}} would not have been able to continue racing.|$|E
5|$|All drivers made pit {{stops by}} the end of lap nine. The race order was Häkkinen, Michael Schumacher, Ralf Schumacher, Alesi, Button, Villeneuve, Barrichello, Frentzen, Coulthard, Diniz, Herbert, Irvine, Zonta, Salo, Gené, Verstappen, de la Rosa, Heidfeld, Wurz and Mazzacane. During that lap Barrichello overtook Frentzen for seventh, whilst Verstappen and Fisichella {{collided}} after Verstappen tried to pass the slowing Benetton at the Bus Stop chicane. Verstappen had front-wing damage, and Fisichella later retired with an electrical problem. By the beginning of lap 13, Michael Schumacher closed his gap from Häkkinen to about 4.6 seconds after four consecutive fastest laps. Later <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lap,</b> Häkkinen touched a kerb at Stavelot corner and was sent spinning sideways into the grass; Michael Schumacher took the lead. Nick Heidfeld was the race's third retirement when his car developed a mechanical problem during that lap.|$|E
40|$|This paper reviews three {{methods used}} to {{evaluate}} <b>the</b> uniformity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lapping</b> process. <b>The</b> first one evaluates <b>the</b> uniformity <b>in</b> <b>lapping</b> process according to studying <b>the</b> uniformity of <b>lapping</b> trajectory. <b>The</b> second one, compared with the measurement pattern based on polar coordinate, explains the advantages of Cartesian-based coordinate pattern <b>in</b> evaluating <b>the</b> <b>lapping</b> uniformity. <b>The</b> last one develops a model to calculate material removal <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lapping</b> process and indicates the uniformity by calculating the material removal.

5|$|In Q3, both Mercedes drivers set two {{consecutive}} fast laps {{at the beginning}} of the session, with Rosberg coming out on top, 0.188 seconds ahead of his teammate. All drivers had problems in improving on their times during the second run of timed laps on fresher tyres. While Hamilton did improve early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lap,</b> his effort was stopped when he made a mistake at turn twelve. This meant that he was unable to challenge Rosberg for pole position, who qualified first for the fourth race in a row. The two Mercedes drivers were closely followed by Vettel, ahead of the two Red Bulls of Kvyat and Ricciardo, both Williams cars and Verstappen in eighth. On the fifth row of the grid, local favourite Sergio Pérez edged out teammate Nico Hülkenberg for ninth.|$|E
5|$|By lap 13, Häkkinen's gap to Coulthard was two seconds, who in {{turn was}} a further ten seconds in front of de la Rosa. Barrichello, who had damage to his car, was a further six seconds behind de la Rosa, but was drawing ahead of Salo in fifth. Verstappen {{suffered}} an gearbox failure and became the fifth retirement of the race on lap 14. On lap 17, Diniz and Zonta were given ten-second stop-go penalties, both for their roles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lap</b> one accidents. They took their penalties immediately. Ralf Schumacher emerged from his garage to rejoin the race on the same lap. Häkkinen had extended his already comfortable lead over Coulthard to 10 seconds by lap 24. Alesi, who was on a two-stop strategy, became the first driver to make a scheduled pit stop on the same lap and exited in thirteenth place. On lap 25, Zonta was involved in another collision when he attempted to overtake Minardi driver Gastón Mazzacane at turn 1 which allowed Diniz to move into fourteenth position.|$|E
5|$|Hotchkiss driver Elliott Shepard, who {{finished}} {{the first day}} in fourth, less than four minutes behind Nazzaro, spent half-an-hour working on his car {{at the start of}} the second day, fitting new tyres and changing liquids. On the eighth lap, he ran off the wooden planking at Saint-Calais but was able to resume; a wheel failure later <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lap</b> caused him to run into a bank of earth and forced him to retire. Panhard driver Georges Teste crashed early in the day and retired, as did Claude Richez of Renault; the sole Gobron-Brillié of Rigolly suffered radiator damage on lap seven and was forced out of the race. After two laps' running on the second day, second-placed Clément had established a 23-minute lead over Nazzaro, but this was reduced to three minutes on the following lap. Despite Nazzaro passing Clément on lap ten, a refuelling stop for the FIAT soon after put Clément back in front. Nazzaro passed again, and led Clément into the last lap of the race by less than a minute.|$|E

5|$|Nelson Piquet was {{the only}} driver not {{to start with the}} softer {{compound}} dry-weather tyres on a track which was still drying from morning rain, with the Brazilian opting for the harder tyre available. There was a strong chance of showers predicted during the race. Several cars were slow away on the slippery track, most notably Kovalainen. The main beneficiaries off the line were Piquet and Trulli, who each gained five places. Trulli was hit from behind at the first corner by Bourdais, who also had a quick start. The Toyota suffered diffuser and gearbox damage from the incident, spinning later <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lap.</b> Kovalainen and Heidfeld also collided at the start. This allowed Alonso to gain several places. Sebastian Vettel locked his brakes and ran wide, losing two places. Fisichella collided with Nakajima on the first lap and had to pit to fix a broken front wing and punctures. Hamilton led from Räikkönen who managed to pass his Ferrari teammate Felipe Massa on the Kemmel straight.|$|E
5|$|The {{race was}} {{restarted}} on lap 26, {{and on the}} approach to the hairpin later <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lap</b> Robert Kubica hit the back of Jarno Trulli's Toyota. The impact forced Kubica onto the grass {{at the edge of}} the track, where a bump launched his car into and along the concrete wall just before the hairpin. After losing three wheels, the nose and suffering major damage to the sidepods in the initial impact, the BMW flipped back across the track and came to rest against the barrier in the run-off area on the other side of the track. Although initial reports said that he had broken his leg, Kubica only suffered a sprained ankle and concussion. The safety car was deployed again after this crash. The safety car was also deployed on lap 50, due to debris from a crash involving Christijan Albers on the previous lap, and on lap 55 due to Vitantonio Liuzzi crashing into the wall of champions once again.|$|E
5|$|The safety {{car pulled}} into the pit-lane {{at the end of}} the secondlap. Vettel {{retained}} his lead into the firstcorner, followed by Kovalainen, Webber, Rosberg and Massa. Kubica passed Heidfeld at the first chicane; Glock passed Alonso later <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lap.</b> Vettel immediately opened a lead of twoseconds over Kovalainen; the McLaren driver experienced visibility problems as a result of the spray off the back of the Toro Rosso. Alonso regained seventh from Glock when he passed him at the first chicane on lapfour as the track began to dry. Räikkönen and Hamilton passed Coulthard on the same lap to take 12th and 13thpositions, respectively. The next lap, Hamilton attempted to pass Räikkönen at the third corner, but overshot, cutting the chicane. Emerging ahead of the Ferrari, he gave the place back, returning the advantage and avoiding a penalty. Glock spun on lapseven, losing oneplace to Kubica.|$|E

25|$|Like the harpsichord, the virginals has {{its origins}} in the medieval psaltery to which a {{keyboard}} was applied, probably in the 15th century. The first mention of the word is in Paulus Paulirinus of Prague's (1413–1471) Tractatus de musica of around 1460 where he writes: The virginal is an instrument {{in the shape of}} a clavichord, having metal strings which give it the timbre of a clavicembalo. It has 32 courses of strings set in motion by striking the fingers on projecting keys, giving a dulcet tone in both whole and half steps. It is called a virginal because, like a virgin, it sounds with a gentle and undisturbed voice. The OED records its first mention in English in 1530, when King Henry VIII purchased five instruments so named. Small early virginals were played either <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>lap,</b> or more commonly, rested on a table, but nearly all later examples were provided with their own stands.|$|E
