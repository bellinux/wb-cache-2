50|$|Using {{experience}} gained building license-built FG-1 series Corsairs, in early 1944 Goodyear extensively modified a standard FG-1 airframe, designated the XF2G-1, {{to take advantage}} of the 50% increase in take-off power provided by the R-4360 engine. In addition, an all-round vision bubble-type canopy was installed. In March 1944, Goodyear was awarded a contract to deliver 418 F2G-1 and 10 F2G-2 aircraft. The F2G-1 was a land-based version with manually folding wings, and the F2G-2, a carrier version with <b>hydraulically</b> <b>folding</b> wings and arrestor hook.Armament provisions included alternative wing-mounted installations for four or six 0.5-inch (12.7 mm) machine guns and eight 5-inch (127 mm) rockets or two 1,000 or 1,600 lb (450 or 725 kg) bombs. The internal fuel capacity was increased greatly over that of the FG-1, and provisions were provided to carry two droppable external tanks.|$|R

2500|$|The XTBD Devastator, which flew for {{the first}} time on 15 April 1935, marked a large number of [...] "firsts" [...] for the US Navy. It was the first widely used carrier-based {{monoplane}} as well as the first all-metal naval aircraft, the first with a totally enclosed cockpit, the first with power-actuated (<b>hydraulically)</b> <b>folding</b> wings and in these respects the TBD was revolutionary. A semi-retractable landing gear was fitted, with the wheels designed to protrude [...] below the wings to permit a [...] "wheels-up" [...] landing which might limit damage to the aircraft. A crew of three was normally carried beneath a large [...] "greenhouse" [...] canopy almost half the length of the aircraft. The pilot sat in front; a rear gunner/radio operator took the rearmost position, while the bombardier occupied the middle seat. During a bombing run, the bombardier lay prone, sliding into position under the pilot to sight through a window in the bottom of the fuselage, using the Norden Bombsight.|$|R
30|$|More precisely, {{sensitivity}} analyses {{have shown that}} the average temperature values in the Molasse Basin are strongly influenced by the hydraulic conductivity of the Folded and Foreland Molasse Sediments (Fig.  9). <b>Hydraulically</b> less conductive <b>Folded</b> Molasse Sediments would lead to higher deep temperatures at the Alpine front, but lower temperatures {{in the rest of the}} basin. <b>Hydraulically</b> more conductive <b>Folded</b> Molasse Sediments would lead more cold water to larger depths causing an overall cooling of the system. A similar effect would be caused by hydraulically more conductive Foreland Molasse Sediments, whereas a lower hydraulic conductivity of the Foreland Molasse Sediments would lead to an overall warming of the system.|$|R
500|$|The new design, {{given the}} company {{designation}} B-48, was known unofficially by Blackburn as the [...] "Firecrest" [...] but was always {{known by its}} specification number by the Air Ministry and Navy. It was a low-winged, single-seat, all-metal monoplane. Aft of the cockpit the fuselage was an oval-shaped stressed-skin semi-monocoque, but forward it had a circular-section, tubular-steel frame. The cockpit of the Firecrest was moved forward and raised the pilot's position so that he now looked over the wing leading edge, and down the nose. The canopy was adapted from the Hawker Tempest fighter. In the rear fuselage was a single [...] fuel tank with two [...] fuel tanks in the centre wing section. The aircraft had a redesigned, thinner, inverted gull wing of laminar flow aerofoil section. The wing consisted of a two-spar centre section with just over 6.5 degrees of anhedral and outer panels with 9 degrees of dihedral. It could be <b>hydraulically</b> <b>folded</b> in two places to allow more compact storage in the hangar decks of aircraft carriers. Four Fowler flaps were fitted to give good low-speed handling for landing and the wing had retractable dive brakes on both surfaces. In {{the course of the}} redesign the structure was simplified which reduced weight by 1,400lb (635kg) and even after the fuel capacity was increased by [...] the gross weight was still [...] less than that of the Firebrand.|$|R
2500|$|The Seiran's wings rotated 90 {{degrees and}} <b>folded</b> <b>hydraulically</b> against the aircraft's {{fuselage}} (with the tail also folding down) {{to allow for}} storage within the submarine's [...] diameter cylindrical hangar.

25|$|Hawker Aircraft {{continued}} {{to develop and}} refine the Sea Fury Mk X, resulting in the more capable Sea Fury Mk 11, otherwise known as the Sea Fury FB 11. This upgraded model had several improvements, most notable being the <b>hydraulically</b> powered wing <b>folding</b> mechanism which eased flight deck operations and the adoption of new weapons for performing air-to-ground combat. Iraq ordered a two-seat Sea Fury model and the British Admiralty followed suit. During testing, the rear canopy collapsed, leading to a redesign of the type's two-seat cockpit prior to entering service. Designated as the Sea Fury T 20, a total of 60 trainers were manufactured for the Fleet Air Arm between 1950 and 1952. The Royal Navy bought a total of 615 Sea Furies, mostly of the Mk 11 standard.|$|R
5000|$|Aichi's final design, {{designated}} AM-24 by Aichi {{and given}} the military designation M6A1, was a two-seat, low-winged monoplane powered by a [...] Aichi AE1P Atsuta 30 engine (a licence-built copy of the Daimler-Benz DB 601 liquid-cooled V12 engine). The original specification dispensed with a traditional undercarriage but it was later decided to fit the aircraft with detachable twin floats to increase its versatility. If conditions permitted, these would allow the aircraft to alight next to the submarine, be recovered by crane and then re-used. The floats could be jettisoned in flight to increase performance or left off altogether for one-way missions.The Seiran's wings rotated 90 degrees and <b>folded</b> <b>hydraulically</b> against the aircraft's fuselage (with the tail also folding down) to allow for storage within the submarine's 3.5 m diameter cylindrical hangar. Armament was a single 850 kg torpedo or an equivalent weight in bombs. One 13 mm Type 2 machine gun was mounted on a flexible mounting {{for use by the}} observer.|$|R
2500|$|Grumman {{had been}} working on a {{successor}} to the F4F Wildcat since 1938 and the contract for the prototype XF6F-1 was signed on 30 June 1941. The aircraft was originally designed to use the Wright R-2600 Twin Cyclone two-row, 14-cylinder radial engine of 1,700hp (1,268kW) driving a three-bladed Curtiss Electric propeller. Instead of the Wildcat's narrow-track, hand-cranked main landing gear retracting into the fuselage that it had inherited, little changed in design from the 1931-debuted Grumman FF-1 fighter biplane, the Hellcat had wide-set, hydraulically actuated landing gear struts which rotated through 90° while retracting backwards into the wings, much like that of the earlier Chance Vought F4U Corsair, but with full wheel doors fitted to the struts that covered the entire strut and the upper half of the main wheel when retracted, and twisted with the main gear struts during retraction. [...] The wing was mounted lower on the fuselage and was able to be <b>hydraulically</b> or manually <b>folded,</b> with each panel outboard of the undercarriage bay folding backwards from pivoting on a specially oriented, Grumman-patented Sto-Wing diagonal axis pivoting system much like the earlier F4F, with a folded stowage position parallel to the fuselage with the leading edges pointing diagonally down.|$|R
5000|$|The {{final version}} of the Seafire was the Seafire F Mk 47 and FR Mk 47. There was no true prototype, instead the first {{production}} aircraft PS944 and PS945 served as trials aircraft. As the [...] "definitive" [...] carrier based Seafire, the Mk 47 incorporated several refinements over earlier variants. After the first four aircraft, with manually folded wings, the Mk 47 incorporated <b>hydraulically</b> powered wing <b>folding,</b> the outer wings folding upwards in one piece, without the folding wingtips of earlier marks. All Mk 47s adopted the Rotol contra-rotating propellers. The Mk 47 also featured a long supercharger air-duct, the intake of which started just behind the spinner and a modified curved windscreen, similar to that used on the Mk XVII. Other features unique to the Mk 47s were spring-loaded elevator tabs, a large inertia weight in the elevator control system and beading on the trailing edges of the elevators. These changes improved longitudinal stability, especially when the aircraft was fully loaded. The modified windscreen proved to be unpopular with pilots because of continual problems with misting and the thicker, repositioned frames obstructed visibility during deck landings. In spite of recommendations to change the windscreen back to a standard Spitfire 24 unit, this was never done. Performance tests showed that the Mk 47 was slightly slower than the Mk 46 in maximum and climbing speeds, mainly due to the long supercharger air intake, which was less efficient than the shorter type fitted to earlier Seafires. The Seafire 47 saw action with 800 Squadron on board [...] during the Malayan Emergency of 1949 and during the Korean War in 1950. However, in 1951 all Seafires were withdrawn from front-line service. In all 90 F Mk 47s and FR Mk 47s were built, all by Supermarine. VR971, the last of the 22,000 aircraft built under the Spitfire/Seafire program, left the production line at Supermarine on 28 January 1949.|$|R
