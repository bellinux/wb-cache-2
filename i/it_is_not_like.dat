25|$|Othering plays a {{fundamental}} {{role in the}} history and continuation of racism. To objectify a culture as something different, exotic or underdeveloped is to generalize that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> 'normal' society. Europe's colonial attitude towards the Orient exemplifies this as it was thought that the East was the opposite of the West; feminine where the West was masculine, weak where the West was strong and traditional where the West was progressive. By making these generalizations and othering the East, Europe was simultaneously defining herself as the norm, further entrenching the gap.|$|E
25|$|On November 1, 2005, Germany {{enacted the}} “Act on Model Case Proceedings in Disputes under Capital Markets Law (Capital Markets Model Case Act)” {{allowing}} sample proceedings {{to be brought}} before the courts in litigation arising from mass capital markets transactions. It {{does not apply to}} any other civil law proceeding. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> class actions in the United Statesit only applies to parties who have already filed suit and does not allow a claim to be brought in the name of an unknown group of claimants. The effects of the new law will be monitored over the next five years. It contains a ‘sunset clause’, and it will automatically cease to have effect on November 1, 2010, unless the legislature decides to prolong the law, or extend it to other mass civil case proceedings.|$|E
500|$|According to Barrales, {{beyond the}} name, Bonded by Blood {{borrowed}} from Exodus for inspiration everything. [...] "From the guitars being razor-sharp to the drums, the speed. We {{wanted to do}} something that resemble that. Something that is gonna be fast and in-your-face. And what better band than Exodus to be inspired by?" [...] Exodus' lead guitarist Gary Holt says that is a compliment that the band has named themselves after Bonded by Blood. [...] "Could I have imagined that all these years later a band was going to name themselves after our first album? Probably not. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> that convention—naming bands after songs—is something new, but I think it is great." ...|$|E

500|$|Jones, {{who played}} Les, {{revealed}} that the runaway storyline was tough on him and he began crying when he read the script. He continued [...] "The four {{of us in the}} Battersby family read our scripts together to work out how we are going to play our parts. On this occasion, all four of us were sobbing. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> a normal Coronation Street story, it's more like a Taggart or a Cracker." [...] Jones thought the [...] "scrapes" [...] that Toyah found herself in were frightening and hoped that if the storyline could stop one teenager from running away from home, then it would be worthwhile. The storyline attracted the attention of the Independent Television Commission, who believed that the episode featuring Toyah's abduction should have carried a warning before it was broadcast.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} {{struggled to}} cast Jessie Bannon. Peter Lawrence ultimately chose Jesse Douglas, who he felt reflected Jessie's energy and intelligence—" [...] has immense energy, huge energy, {{and is the}} kind of woman who could do all the kind of things Jessie could do—you know, athletic, smart, so and so forth [...]" [...] Douglas impressed Lawrence with her active lifestyle, including ballet, equestrianism, and tennis. When asked about the character's inclusion, Douglas stated, [...] "I'd be bummed if I upset anybody. Jessie is pretty cool. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> she is a girl who is whining all the time. If anything, she is a really good springboard {{for the rest of the}} storyline." [...] Roth supported her, claiming that [...] "Jonny hasn't discovered girls yet but when he does Jessie would be the type of girl he'd like to be with... I think something will happen between them but right now Jess is his best friend." [...] H-B Chief Fred Seibert agreed, hinting that as adults [...] "there might be a Tracy/Hepburn thing going on." [...] Turner approached George Segal to audition for the part of Dr. Quest. Segal described the show as having [...] "a real family feeling about it... I'd never seen this stuff before. That was quite remarkable." ...|$|E
500|$|Accompanying Duff's {{new musical}} style, the record label began {{promoting}} {{her with a}} more mature image. Duff dyed her hair dark and [...] "sexed-up" [...] her image. According to Duff, she wanted to [...] "try new things", but the image change [...] "just happened. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> a conscious change. People think it is so different because they have watched me grow up but that is just what happens in life." [...] Entertainment Weekly described Duff's new look as comprising [...] "dark mane, dental veneers, luxe and vampy fashions". In mid-2007, concurrent to {{the preparation of the}} radio release of [...] "Stranger", Duff was featured on the July covers of the magazines Us Weekly and Shape in a bikini, and on the August cover of Maxim accompanied by the declaration that she had gone [...] "from the queen of teen to breakout sex symbol". The Associated Press wrote that Duff's more provocative image would help her singles to garner mainstream radio play. Guy Zapoleon, a radio consultant and former programmer for Top 40 radio, explained that [...] "radio has a stigma about playing [...] acts, considering them teen and preteen in their appeal", and that Duff's provocative image would [...] "definitely {{have a positive effect on}} the attitude of programmers, who are mostly male, as Disney tries to mature her image". A bonus EP containing five bonus remixes was released exclusively to US WalMart stores as a package with the album.|$|E

2500|$|Domestic partner {{registration}} is an uncomplicated process, more simple and less costly than entering into a marriage. Both parties must sign a declaration listing {{their names and}} address. [...] Both signatures must be notarized. The declaration must then be transmitted to the Secretary of State along with a $10 filing fee (plus an additional $23 fee for same-sex couples to help fund LGBT-specific domestic violence training and services). In this regard <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> a marriage or civil union. Those unions require a ceremony, solemnized by either religious clergy or civil officials, to be deemed valid.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his book}} Sensing the World, Moreland Perkins argues that qualia {{need not be}} {{identified}} with their objective sources: a smell, for instance, bears no direct resemblance to the molecular shape that gives rise to it, nor is a toothache actually in the tooth. He is also like Hobbes {{in being able to}} view the process of sensing as being something complete in itself; as he puts it, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> [...] "kicking a football" [...] where an external object is required—it is more like [...] "kicking a kick", an explanation which entirely avoids the familiar Homunculus Objection, as adhered to, for example, by Gilbert Ryle. Ryle was quite unable even to entertain this possibility, protesting that [...] "in effect it explained the having of sensations as the not having of sensations." [...] However, A.J. Ayer in a rejoinder identified this objection as [...] "very weak" [...] as it betrayed an inability to detach the notion of eyes, indeed any sensory organ, from the neural sensory experience.|$|E

2500|$|Disjunction resembles {{conjunction}} in that {{it forms}} a proposition out of two simpler propositions. [...] We write it , and it is read [...] " [...] or [...] ". [...] It expresses that either [...] or [...] is true. [...] Thus, in the cases listed above, the disjunction of [...] with [...] is true in all cases except case 4. [...] Using the example above, the disjunction expresses that it is either raining outside or there is a cold front over Kansas. [...] (Note, this use of disjunction is supposed to resemble {{the use of the}} English word [...] "or". [...] However, it is most like the English inclusive [...] "or", which can be used to express the truth of at least one of two propositions. [...] <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> the English exclusive [...] "or", which expresses the truth of exactly one of two propositions. [...] That is to say, the exclusive [...] "or" [...] is false when both [...] and [...] are true (case 1). [...] An example of the exclusive or is: [...] You may have a bagel or a pastry, but not both. Often in natural language, given the appropriate context, the addendum [...] "but not both" [...] is omitted but implied. In mathematics, however, [...] "or" [...] is always inclusive or; if exclusive or is meant it will be specified, possibly by [...] "xor".) ...|$|E
