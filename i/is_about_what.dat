The agenda of the meeting <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> {{will be seen as}} dangerous imbalances in the global economy. The United States has run up massive accounts and budget deficits, export-led surpluses are developing in Asia. It also marks the debut to the G7 meetings, that is United States Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, who was formerly the {{chairman and chief executive officer}} of Goldman Sachs. The United States wants the fight against terrorism and nuclear proliferation to be included on the agenda. The Program of Seminars opens on this day and runs for two days. The G24 ministers meeting will be held at SSICEC as well as the Program of Seminars.|$|E

[...] She identified with the stories in Love, Loss, and What I Wore because the book [...] "is not about fashion; it <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> clothes really are to us, those moments when we are constantly trying to find our identity through them". [...] Soon after its publication, Ephron gave the book to eight of her friends for Christmas. She became interested in writing her {{own version of the}} book.

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Swift revealed that [...] "Mine" [...] was inspired by an unnamed crush in mind, saying [...] "I was reflecting back on a boy I liked at a certain time." [...] She also told MTV that the song <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> {{it would be like}} if she actually let her guard down. During a live Ustream chat with fans on July 20, 2010, Swift explained that the song is about [...] "her tendency to run from love" [...] after seeing many relationships end in goodbye and breakups. She continued, [...] "I think I've developed this pattern of sort of running away {{when it comes time to}} fall in love and to stay in a relationship. The song is sort of about finding the exception to that and finding someone who would make you believe in love and realize that it could work out." ...|$|E
500|$|Up to this point, {{soap operas}} used rape and its related archetypes to, like their nineteenth-century melodrama counterparts, [...] "critique power relationships, {{especially}} {{the oppression of}} the poor by the rich and of women by men". [...] Hayward believes that the storyline was initially flawed because two of the rapists, Todd and Zach, were demonized, which oversimplified rape and [...] "failed to capture the complex power relations underlying... violence towards women". [...] The perpetrators were [...] "simply evil or out control", so they and their mindsets they represented could be rejected. [...] The three characters represented three archetypes of the rapist: [...] "the evil instigator" [...] (Todd); [...] "the good resister" [...] (Powell), and [...] "the mediator between these polarized figures" [...] (Zach), but also represented a departure from how rape was treated in soap operas. [...] Brooks called the rapists [...] "a complicated alternative to the standard soap opera rapist", {{because they had a}} different relationship with their victim than in previous rape narratives and because they were multiple. Todd, whom Brooks called the [...] "evil 'other, was the leader and most villainous of the group and had a previous physical relationship with Marty. [...] Hayward said, [...] "What becomes especially clear is that for these characters the act of rape is not about sex, about women, or even about Marty. It <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> takes place... between men." ...|$|E
500|$|Swift {{commenced}} composing [...] "White Horse" [...] {{almost a}} year before the release of Fearless, weeks after composing Fearless lead single [...] "Love Story", songs which are quite disparate lyrically. Swift first solely wrote the first verse. She then made a phone call to Liz Rose, co-writer of most tracks on Swift's eponymous debut studio album, Taylor Swift (2006), asking for her aid in finishing the song; the two completed writing the song in approximately forty-five minutes. The song was inspired by a boyfriend of Swift's who she perceived to be a Prince Charming and, in the downfall of the relationship, then realized he was not. She said he was the person who triggered the song, but, once in the midst of writing it, drifted in direction. It focused on the initial moment where she recognized the relationship was over. She said everything after that particular moment centered on recuperation and, because of that, considered it the most solemn aspect of a breakup: [...] "To me, 'White Horse' <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>what,</b> in my opinion, is the most heart-breaking part of a break-up – that moment when you realize that all the dreams you had, all those visions you had of being with this person, all that disappears." [...] About the difference in themes between [...] "White Horse" [...] and [...] "Love Story", Swift explained that in divergent scenarios, she regarded fairytales in different manners. She attributed the fact that because she did not expect to go through the event, then she became more inclined to come in terms with reality.|$|E

500|$|When {{asked about}} {{possible}} hints {{made in the}} season two finale towards an adaptation of Secret Warriors, Bell noted that the series does share the character Daisy Johnson with that comic, and [...] "the idea {{of a team of}} powered people is something we've seen in the show ... I think there's a world down the road where we do our version." [...] Elaborating on this and the series dealing with the many powered people introduced in season two, Bell said, [...] "People seem to respond to powered people on the show and while it's not going to take over and become what the show's about, as a texture and flavor of the stories, we really enjoy that. The fact that Inhumans are now out there is something I think we need to investigate". He later clarified that characters would not have to be Inhuman to join the Secret Warriors, just powered, and that not just any powered character would be allowed to join, given that Johnson had to go through years of training on top of getting powers to join the team, and so similar rules would apply to other potential members. Executive producers Maurissa Tancharoen and Jed Whedon also discussed the Secret Warriors, the former cautioning [...] "a very slow build" [...] to the team, and the latter explaining, [...] "We feel a duty to the Cinematic Universe to not hyper-accelerate how many people have powers ... We don't want it to be there's a thousand people with powers with a show that at its heart <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> it's like to not have powers in a world with powers." ...|$|E
500|$|For each mission, {{a player}} {{is given a}} {{briefing}} in regards to it, which details relevant information on what the mission <b>is</b> <b>about,</b> <b>what</b> to expect, and what objectives {{are expected to be}} completed, although not all actual situations and objectives are detailed. In between some missions, players are also given a command briefing, stating the current situation of the campaign, as well as information on any new ships and weapons being released for use. Before flying out on a mission, players can modify the ship and weapons load-outs for their own starfighter and those of their own wingmen and other wings for the mission; for some missions, the load-out is either fixed for the mission, or is whatever the player set up in the previous one, while what ships and weapons are available depend on the progress on the mission, with stronger weapons and ships becoming available only in later missions. The level of control over load-outs prior to committing to a mission adds an element of strategy to the campaign. The results of a mission can often affect how later missions play out; for example, an enemy capital ship allowed to flee in a particular mission may return in a later mission. Completing a mission and leaving when given authorisation, leads to a debriefing screen which outlays what was achieved by the player and any aspects that could have been done better; players can get a hint, defined as [...] "recommendations", to see what they could have done better, and can restart a mission to play the mission out differently. Player's can earn medals after some missions, either for completing a specific mission, or achieving certain hidden criteria/bonus objectives, receive promotions depending on the kills and types of alongside the difficulty being played at, and badges for overall total of kills made by them. Furthermore, players can replay any single player mission they complete through the in-game mission simulator.|$|E

[...] While the series was not to be a political piece according to Kemp, he did consider the Iraq invasion was [...] "a mistake", but believed the British involvement in Afghanistan to be a just war.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} forms of ethical subjectivism are also forms of moral relativism, with moral {{standards}} {{held to be}} relative to each culture or society (c.f. cultural relativism), or even to every individual. The latter view, as put forward by Protagoras, holds that {{there are as many}} distinct scales of good and evil as there are subjects in the world. However, there are also universalist forms of subjectivism such as ideal observer theory (which claims that moral propositions <b>are</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> attitudes a hypothetical ideal observer would hold) and divine command theory (which claims that moral propositions <b>are</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> attitudes God holds).|$|R
