50|$|Fellowship alumni Eytan Rubinstein, Karan Magu, and Phil Hayes founded an incubator-like {{platform}} in India where students from U.S. and Israeli universities collaborate with students from Indian universities (such as Indian Institutes of Technology) in creating ventures {{with a social}} impact focus. This is the only official platform that exists which facilitates venture building between Indian, American, and Israeli university students. Following an <b>ingnition</b> trip in 2017 which included 40 meetings across New Delhi, Bangalore, and Mumbai, the official launch is set for summer 2018.|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{reports on}} <b>ingnition</b> studies {{performed}} at EMI-AFB investigating the electrical ignition of the hydroxylammonium nitrate (HAN) based liquid gun propellant LP 1846. The {{goal is to}} develop an ingiter system suitable for regenerative liquid propellant guns. Several ingiter configurations, designed by the Ballistic Research Laboratory (BRL) and the Ernst-Mach-Institute EMI-AFB, have been tested. Voltage and current {{as well as the}} pressure histories were measured for each discharge. A theoretical analysis yielded improved electrode designs for furture testing...|$|E
40|$|Resins {{used for}} {{injection}} into walls of coal mines must not fulfill fire standard DIN 22100, part 1 - 7, as the injected resin {{is supposed to}} be locked totally in the rock. Hithertoo, limit of resin cure temperature is 150 Cel. However, different fire hazards in coal mines using PUR resins for rock injection caused revision of Standard fire tests for injection resins. Investigations have been carried out with PUR resins BEVEDAN/BEVEDON S, MARITHAN, HEFIX K, nad ERKADOL/ERKADUR, and problems due to self-ignition of coal dust and influence of water on resin curing have been studied in detail. The results are: <b>Ingnition</b> point of the resin must be greater than 55 Cel; Maximum cure temperature of pure PUR resin should not exceed 110 Cel, and 130 Cel with water-containing resin; Foaming factor should not exceed factor 2; Self-ignition of coal dust must be prevented by pre-testing in a special apparatus.

40|$|In a {{test program}} {{consisting}} {{of a series of}} 17 tests, experimental studies of the combustion of "pancake-shaped" free clouds of near-stoichiometric methane/ethane/air and propane/air mixtures of a volume of up to 13. 000 cubicmeter under different test conditions were carried out. The parameters were the geometry and size of the cloud, geometry of the source of <b>ingnition</b> (are, line, and point ignition), geometry and arrangement of obstacles (cubic and/or cylindrical), and generation of different turbulence fields. The flame propagation and the pressure/time course of the pressure waves produced by the flame were measured. In undisturbed clouds the maximum flame speeds did not exceed 6 - 8 m/s and the maximum overpressures were 1 - 2 mbar. The results indicate a slight increase in flame speed {{as a function of the}} distance traveled by the flamed front due to flame-induced turbulence. Additional turbulence and obstacles increase the flame speed significantly. For a rms turbulent velocity of u ' = 0, 56 m/s (20 % turbulence level), typical flame speeds of up to 20 m/s and corresponding overpressures of about 5 mbar were measured. At obstacles, gaps, and entries and exits of lanes, higher turbulence levels were generated, resulting in local increases in flame speeds and overpressures of up to 80 m/s and 80 mbar, respectively. The peak overpressures were found to be approximately proportional to the square of the flame speed...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} study {{describes an}} on-board fuel tailoring process {{based on a}} novel and compact catalytic fuel evaporator, capable of optimizing Homogenous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) combustion. Evaporation tests with conventional diesel were performed revealing {{a significant amount of}} long-chain alkane cracking. As a consequence of these cracking reactions, the presented experiments demonstrate that the produced fuel vapor has altered combustion properties as compared to the feeding diesel stream. Further tests using a constant volume chamber at 30 bar, over the temperature range 500 to 1120 K, indicated that ignition delay time and auto ignition temperature of this fuel vapor can be shifted from diesel to gasoline. Thus, by performing dynamic on-board adjustment of the fuel properties, it is possible therefore to increase HCCI combustion to high loads. Complimentary to experiments with the fuel evaporator, GT-Power Simulations were also performed, with the aim to predict the boundary conditions to be used in subsequent engine tests. Engine tests were performed with the evaporator device mounted directly at the intake manifold of a one cylinder diesel research-engine, acting as a port injection. Compared to conventional diesel operation, a considerable reduction of NOx was observed, whilst Particulate Matter (PM) emissions were below the limit of detection. Significantly, the presented work demonstrates that <b>ingnition</b> timing is also controllable. By adjusting the fuel vapor composition, the combustion phase can be shifted without Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) to the After Top Dead Center (ATDC) ...|$|E
