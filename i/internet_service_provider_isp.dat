2500|$|However, in 2007 the U.S. District Court {{struck down}} even the reauthorized NSLs because the gag power was unconstitutional as courts could still {{not engage in}} {{meaningful}} judicial review of these gags. On August 28, 2015, Judge Victor Marrero of the federal district court in Manhattan ruled the gag order of Nicholas Merrill was unjustified. In his decision, Judge Marrero described the FBI's position as, [...] "extreme and overly broad," [...] affirming that [...] "courts consistent with the First Amendment, simple accept the Government's assertions that disclosure would implicate and create a risk." [...] He {{also found that the}} FBI's gag order on Mr. Merrill [...] "implicates serious issues, both with respect to the First Amendment and accountability of the government to the people." [...] Initially, the ruling was released in redaction by Judge Marrero. The FBI was given 90 days to pursue any other alternative course of action, but elected not to do so. Upon release of the unredacted ruling on November 30, 2015, it was revealed {{for the first time the}} extent to which the FBI's NSL accompanied by a gag order sought to collect information. Through the court documents, it was revealed for the first time that through an NSL, the FBI believes it can legally obtain information including an individual's complete web browsing history, the IP addresses of everyone a person has corresponded with, and all the records of all online purchases within the last 180 days. The FBI also claims via the extension of a NSL, it can obtain cell site location information. In the landmark case of Nicholas Merrill the FBI in specific sought to seek the following information on an account: DSL account information, radius log, subscriber name and related subscriber information, account number, date the account opened or closed, addresses associated with the account, subscriber day/evening telephone numbers, screen names or other on-line names associated with the account, order forms, records relating to merchandise orders/shipping information for the last 180 days, all billing related to the account, <b>internet</b> <b>service</b> <b>provider</b> (<b>ISP),</b> all email addresses associated with the account, internet protocol address assigned to the account, all website information registered to the account, uniform resource locator address assigned to the account, any other information which you consider to be an electronic communication transactional record.
