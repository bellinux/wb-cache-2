5|$|Little {{is known}} of Jogaila's early life, and <b>even</b> <b>his</b> year of birth is uncertain. Previously historians assumed {{he was born in}} 1352, but some recent {{research}} suggests a later date—about 1362. He was a descendant of the Gediminid dynasty and was probably born in Vilnius. His parents were Algirdas, Grand Duke of Lithuania, and his second wife, Uliana, daughter of Alexander I, Grand Prince of Tver.|$|E
5|$|There {{also exist}} hatt-ı hümayuns expressing the sultan's {{opinions}} or <b>even</b> <b>his</b> feelings on certain matters. For example, after the successful defense of Mosul against {{the forces of}} Nadir Shah, in 1743, Sultan Mahmud I sent a hatt-ı hümayun to the governor Haj Husayn Pasha, which praised in verse the heroic exploits of the governor and the warriors of Mosul.|$|E
5|$|UEFA Euro 1996 {{was a more}} {{positive}} experience for both Shearer and England. With England not required to qualify as hosts, Shearer had not scored in 12 games in the 21 months prior, and <b>even</b> <b>his</b> overall goalscoring record for England did not look too impressive so far; five goals in 23 games.|$|E

5|$|All {{members of}} the Junta Grande {{assisted}} to Alberti's funeral, <b>even</b> <b>his</b> political enemy Gregorio Funes. Domingo Matheu was the most affected one by his death, {{to the point of}} crying for it. Alberti was replaced in the Junta by Nicolás Rodríguez Peña, a decided morenist. Saavedra and Funes did not like him, but with the social commotion generated by Alberti's death, they avoided to offer resistance to his nomination.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from his}} death, remarkably {{little is known}} of Cooke's circumstances. <b>Even</b> <b>his</b> date of birth is unclear, and unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however well {{respected}} in his profession and following his death {{was the subject of}} tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in St Paul's Cathedral and his local church in Wiltshire.|$|E
5|$|Boone's adventures, {{real and}} mythical, {{formed the basis}} of the archetypal hero of the American West, popular in 19th-century novels and 20th-century films. The main {{character}} of James Fenimore Cooper's Leatherstocking Tales, the first of which was published in 1823, bore striking similarities to Boone; <b>even</b> <b>his</b> name, Nathaniel Bumppo, echoed Daniel Boone's name. As mentioned above, The Last of the Mohicans (1826), Cooper's second Leatherstocking novel, featured a fictionalized version of Boone's rescue of his daughter. After Cooper, other writers developed the Western hero, an iconic figure which began as a variation of Daniel Boone.|$|E

5|$|Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) {{returns to}} his team in {{spectacular}} fashion, walking {{into the middle of}} a hostage situation involving his team and an alien Blowfish, shooting the intoxicated Blowfish in the head. At the Hub, his team question why he left them, and he simply responds that he had found his Doctor and that he belongs at Torchwood. The team is then alerted to a death near a multi-storey car park, where the team detect energy from the Rift on the corpse. Jack, to <b>even</b> <b>his</b> surprise, gets a hologram message on his vortex manipulator from a person he recognises, and leaves the team to talk to him.|$|E
5|$|Compared to his two fellow protagonists, C.T. Smith was {{considered}} more novel. Anime News Network {{said he was}} one of the few fresh points of the series and had the most distinctive design among the cast, though <b>even</b> <b>his</b> role as an unassuming businessman who is actually an expert gunman felt as if it must be borrowed from somewhere else. MangaCast's reviewer, on the other hand, found his role mostly extraneous, due to being overshadowed by Gamma. Animemaniacs Magazine Online noted that Smith's physical appearance was later echoed by Bleachs central antagonist, Sōsuke Aizen.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the game}} was handled {{by a team of}} seven people over the course of ten months. It was {{directed}} and written by Shu Takumi, and was originally planned to be a Game Boy Color game about a private investigator. The game was designed to be simple, as Takumi wanted it to be easy enough for <b>even</b> <b>his</b> mother to play. While the original version {{of the game}} takes place in Japan, the localization is set in the United States; this became an issue when localizing later games, where the Japanese setting was more obvious.|$|E

Before they can depart for Wolfe's lab in New Marais, the Beast attacks Empire City. Cole tries to fight him off, but <b>even</b> <b>his</b> most powerful attack proves useless. The group is subsequently forced to flee as Empire City is completely and utterly destroyed.|$|E
5|$|He {{also built}} the Temple of Caesar, the Baths of Agrippa, and the Forum of Augustus with its Temple of Mars Ultor. Other {{projects}} were either encouraged by him, {{such as the}} Theatre of Balbus, and Agrippa's construction of the Pantheon, or funded by him {{in the name of}} others, often relations (e.g. Portico of Octavia, Theatre of Marcellus). <b>Even</b> <b>his</b> Mausoleum of Augustus was built before his death to house members of his family.|$|E
5|$|In May 2008, Obama asked Lu {{to begin}} {{planning}} for a possible presidential transition. Obama warned him to tell no one about the nascent operation, <b>even</b> <b>his</b> own wife, so Lu quietly rented a small office in D.C. and secretly met with people who had worked on previous Democratic presidential transition efforts. The planning efforts produced policy options {{on a wide range}} of topics, compiled names of and began vetting potential political appointees for top jobs, arranged over 100 security clearances, and managed the logistics for expanding the operations after Election Day.|$|E

5|$|In the 2005 civic election, he {{was again}} elected, though his Richmond First party only won {{three of the}} eight seats. He unsuccessfully lobbied his fellow councillors to appoint him to fill one of Richmond's two seats at Metro Vancouver. With not <b>even</b> <b>his</b> own party members {{supporting}} him for the Metro Vancouver seat and finding himself being alone {{in a number of}} issues, such as supporting the SkyTrain line being elevated, opposing the tree preservation bylaw, and wanting to hire more police officers, Howard left the Richmond First party in February 2006 to be an independent.|$|E
5|$|Josephine, who was of Jewish heritage, had Earp's body cremated and {{secretly}} buried his {{remains in the}} Marcus family plot at the Hills of Eternity, a Jewish cemetery in Colma, California. When she died in 1944, her remains were interred alongside his. In 1957, the Tombstone Restoration Commission looked for Wyatt's ashes {{with the goal of}} having them moved to Tombstone. They contacted family members seeking permission and the location of his ashes, but no one could tell them where Wyatt was buried, not <b>even</b> <b>his</b> closest living relative, George Earp. Arthur King, a deputy to Earp from 1910 to 1912, finally revealed that Josephine had buried Wyatt's cremated remains in Colma, California, and the Tombstone Commission cancelled its plans to relocate his ashes.|$|E
5|$|Norreis {{has been}} {{described}} by modern historians as being unsuited for the religious positions to which he was appointed and by one of being completely unsuitable to hold any kind of spiritual role. Nevertheless, <b>even</b> <b>his</b> most severe contemporary critic, Thomas of Marlborough, one of his own monks at Evesham, conceded that Norreis was energetic, entertaining, and enterprising; during his time as abbot of Evesham Abbey he managed to complete the crossing tower of the monastic church. Roger Norreis died between 1223 and 1225.|$|E

5|$|Prokofiev's latest opera projects, {{among them}} his {{desperate attempt to}} appease the {{cultural}} authorities, The Story of a Real Man, were quickly cancelled by the Kirov Theatre. The snub, in combination with his declining health, caused Prokofiev to progressively withdraw from public life and from various activities, <b>even</b> <b>his</b> beloved chess, and increasingly devote himself to his own work. After a serious relapse in 1949, his doctors ordered him to limit his composing to an hour a day.|$|E
5|$|Robert Kurrle (February 2, 1890 – October 27, 1932), {{also known}} as Robert B. Kurrle, was an American cinematographer during the silent and early talking film eras. Prior to {{entering}} the film industry, he was already experimenting with aerial photography. Considered a very prominent cinematographer, <b>even</b> <b>his</b> early work received notice and praise from both critics and other industry professionals. The advent of sound film did not abate his continued rise, and he became the top director of photography at Warner Brothers by 1932.|$|E
5|$|Rojhaz {{is in fact}} Steve Rogers, {{the future}} costumed superhero known as Captain America. After {{fighting}} against a future fascist government dictatorship of the 21st century run by the President-For-Life, Rogers was captured. Wanting to dispose of Rogers so completely that not <b>even</b> <b>his</b> ashes would remain to inspire future rebellion, the President-for-Life had Rogers placed into a machine which should have killed him but instead sent him into the 1602 timeline. His presence not only brought about a rift that will destroy the universe, but it also caused the heroes {{of the twentieth century}} to appear centuries earlier to counter the Forerunner's negative effects.|$|E
