5|$|Before the Mexican–American War, {{when this}} area was ceded to the United States, the main trade route through this part of Mexico was the Old Spanish Trail. This trail {{extended}} from Santa Fe, New Mexico to Los Angeles. The trail had multiple routes; however, the main route proceeded north towards Moab, Utah, one of the <b>few</b> <b>places</b> <b>where</b> the Colorado River can be crossed without having to traverse steep cliffs. The modern US491 roughly correlates with the main route of the Old Spanish Trail between Cortez, Colorado and its northern terminus.|$|E
5|$|The {{rocks are}} home to over 70 species of animals and 340 species of plants, which {{includes}} over 200 species of wildflowers. Vernal pools atop the plateaus fill {{during the rainy season}} in winter and spring because the andesite is impermeable. The dwarf woolly meadowfoam, a species of wildflower, grows around these pools, and is endemic to the rocks. The pools are also one of only a <b>few</b> <b>places</b> <b>where</b> the federally threatened species of fairy shrimp, Branchinecta lynchi, can be found. To protect these and other threatened species, the Bureau of Land Management has listed the rocks as an Area of Critical Environmental Concern since 1984.|$|E

50|$|The manor was {{previously}} owned by William the Conquer of 1066. William gave {{the house to}} Walter De Turberville and his family stayed for 145 years. Turberville granted the manor to the Knights Hospitaller of Saint John of Jerusalem in 1210-1211. At that time Ansty {{would have been one}} of only a handful <b>few</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> the holy observances were still celebrated, since the Knights Hospitallers, who answered directly to Rome, were excluded from Pope Innocent III's interdict (1208-1214).|$|R

It is here that Capt. Messick was killed, Capt. W. B. Farrell mortally wounded, and then command fell to Capt. Henry C. Coates.|$|E
25|$|The {{new state}} set itself up as best it could. Its Governor-General was {{installed}} in the former Viceregal Lodge, residence of the British Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, because it {{was thought to be}} one of the <b>few</b> <b>places</b> <b>where</b> he was not in danger from republican assassins. Parliament was set up temporarily in the Duke of Leinster's old palace, Leinster House, where it has remained ever since. Over time, the GPO, Custom House and Four Courts were rebuilt.

25|$|The Teatro Principal {{was built}} at the city’s height when {{the wealth of the}} mines {{attracted}} entertainers. It was the first theater in the city, built in Neoclassical style and one of the <b>few</b> <b>places</b> <b>where</b> people of different social strata could enter. The theater closed periodically during its early history due to sociopolitical upheavals. After the Mexican Revolution, it was converted into a movie theater. Shortly after this, it suffered a fire and closed for 30 years. Today, it is reconstructed and run by the University of Guanajuato as one of the main venues of the Festival Cervantino.|$|E
25|$|That {{interchange}} {{marked a}} change in the parkway's design reflecting an evolution within the engineering community. Previously the parkway had been mostly undivided, with medians only in a <b>few</b> <b>places</b> <b>where</b> necessary. This, a practice of the WSPC, had helped save land acquisition costs. But increasingly medians proved to be safer and more scenic. The segment between routes 52 and 82 at Arthursburg was the first designed as a fully divided parkway, with a continuous median. For the rest of the Taconic's construction, the roadways would come together only when necessary, at bridges and grade intersections.|$|E

25|$|At one time, {{the region}} also had {{numerous}} passenger rail services, including both interurban streetcar systems and interstate rail. Due to {{the width of the}} river at points further south, the Minneapolis–Saint Paul area was briefly one of the <b>few</b> <b>places</b> <b>where</b> the Mississippi could be crossed by railroad. A great amount of commercial rail traffic also ran through the area, often carrying grain to be processed at mills in Minneapolis or delivering other goods to Saint Paul to be transported along the Mississippi. Saint Paul had long been at the head of navigation on the river, prior to a new lock and dam facility being added upriver in Minneapolis.|$|E

In the second half of his career he never made an effort which did not pay off 100 per cent. He reduced a race to a few simple calculations, a few danger men and a <b>few</b> <b>places</b> <b>where</b> it was necessary to make an effort.

25|$|A {{high quality}} {{traditional}} shirt has long tails, extending {{almost to the}} knees at the back, and so has seven or eight buttons. The vertical strip of fabric running down the front opening is called the placket, and gives a more symmetrical appearance to the joint between the left side, on top, and the right. This left over right order is also seen in waistcoat and coat fastenings, though women's clothing buttons the other way (right over left). The buttonholes, aligned vertically, are placed on the placket, though the top button and buttons {{at the bottom of}} stiff fronts are aligned horizontally. The buttonholes are one of the <b>few</b> <b>places</b> <b>where</b> the difference between hand and machine stitching can be observed while the shirt is being worn, and fashion designers sometimes use contrasting thread here or on the buttons themselves for extra impact.|$|E

25|$|Due {{in part to}} the {{richness}} of Pacific Northwest Coast and river fisheries, some of the indigenous peoples developed complex sedentary societies while remaining hunter-gatherers. The Pacific Northwest Coast is one of the <b>few</b> <b>places</b> <b>where</b> politically complex hunter-gatherers evolved and survived to historic contacts, and therefore has been vital for anthropologists and archaeologists seeking to understand how complex hunter and gatherer societies function. When Europeans first arrived on the Northwest Coast, they found one of the world's most complex hunting and fishing societies, with large sedentary villages, large houses, systems of social rank and prestige, extensive trade networks, and many other factors more commonly associated with societies based on domesticated agriculture. In the interior of the Pacific Northwest, the indigenous peoples, at the time of European contact, had a diversity of cultures and societies. Some areas were home to mobile and egalitarian societies. Others, especially along major rivers such as the Columbia and Fraser, had very complex, affluent, sedentary societies rivaling those of the coast.|$|E
500|$|Echinoderms first {{appeared}} in the fossil record in the Cambrian. [...] The first known asterozoans were the Somasteroidea, which exhibit characteristics of both groups. Modern starfish and brittle stars probably had a common somasteroid ancestor. Starfish are infrequently found as fossils, possibly because their hard skeletal components separate as the animal decays. Despite this, there are a <b>few</b> <b>places</b> <b>where</b> accumulations of complete skeletal structures occur, fossilized in place in Lagerstätten — so-called [...] "starfish beds".|$|E

500|$|One of {{the most}} {{noteworthy}} aspects of Newfoundland geology {{is a result of}} the constant movement of tectonic plates. Approximately 500million years ago the action of these plates forced parts of the oceanic crust beneath the Iapetus Ocean up and over the eastern margin of the North American plate. [...] Sections of oceanic crust which overlie continental crust are known as ophiolites. Gros Morne National Park was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site because it is one of the best places in the world to see the effects of plate tectonics and one of the <b>few</b> <b>places</b> <b>where</b> rocks formed at the Mohorovicic Discontinuity between the crust and the upper mantle of the Earth can be seen.|$|E
500|$|Zelda's name {{served as}} {{inspiration}} for Princess Zelda, the eponymous character of The Legend of Zelda series of video games. Series co-creator Shigeru Miyamoto explained, [...] " [...] {{was a famous}} and beautiful woman from all accounts, and I liked {{the sound of her}} name. So I took the liberty of using her name for the very first Zelda title." [...] New York City's borough of Manhattan's Battery Park's resident wild turkey Zelda (d. 2014) was also named after her, because according to legend during one of Fitzgerald's nervous breakdowns, she went missing and was found in Battery Park, apparently having walked several miles downtown. Of Zelda's legacy in popular culture, biographer Cline wrote, [...] "Recently myth has likened Zelda to those other twentieth-century icons, Marilyn Monroe and Princess Diana. With each she shares a defiance of convention, intense vulnerability, doomed beauty, unceasing struggle for a serious identity, short tragic life and quite impossible nature." [...] In 1989, the F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald museum opened in Montgomery, Alabama. The museum is in a house they briefly rented in 1931 and 1932. It is one of the <b>few</b> <b>places</b> <b>where</b> some of Zelda's paintings are kept on display.|$|E

[...] Allrovi reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that [...] "There isn't a single moment that establishes a distinct musical identity, and the whole thing is rather embarrassing." [...] Primus bassist Les Claypool stated in response to Ice's cannabis-oriented lyrics: [...] "That's all fine and dandy and cute, but it could be misconstrued and manipulated by the wrong people." [...] When asked about the drug oriented sound years later, Vanilla Ice said [...] "A lot of the record is drug oriented because I was doing a lot of drugs at the time".
