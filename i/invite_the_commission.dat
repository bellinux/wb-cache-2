50|$|Citizen {{initiatives}} are democratic mechanisms that let citizens propose and vote on laws and policies. By gathering {{a certain number}} of signatures, citizens can demand a binding vote on a proposed policy or legislation. With the European Citizens’ Initiative, citizens can <b>invite</b> <b>the</b> <b>Commission</b> to look at the proposed policy or legislation; it is not obliged to act. Citizen initiatives differ from referendums in which citizens only can accept or reject a law or policy proposed by parliament. Also, it has been stated by the European Commission that an ECI can only be the subject of the acceptation/creation of a law, but it cannot ask to reject a law.|$|E
40|$|The European Citizens’ Initiative is the {{expression}} of participatory democracy within the European Union, where one million citizens of it, who have their domicile {{in at least one}} quarter of the Member States, have the right to <b>invite</b> <b>the</b> <b>Commission,</b> to submit a proposal for a legal act in the application of treaties. The Citizens Initiative has its source in the concept of European Union Citizenship, first governed by the Treaty of Maastricht (Treaty on European Union/TEU). At present, the European Citizens’ Initiative has its legal basis in the TEU, TFEU, Regulation (EU) No. 211 / 2011 and in the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament. Regulation (EU) No. 211 / 2011, establishes detailed procedures and conditions for the Commission to make such an initiative. Since the implementation of the EU Injunction, three initiatives have been submitted to the Commission, which have proved viable...|$|E
40|$|Within the {{framework}} of its Digital Single Market (DSM) agenda, the European Union proposes the adoption of new legislative proposals aimed at removing remaining obstacles to digital transactions. Proposals relate to the abolition of geo-blocking as well as data and copyright portability. Complementing competition law provisions, those initiatives would seek to create the conditions for a competitive e-commerce environment within the EU internal market. In doing so, the Commission implicitly but clearly seeks to replicate a regulatory and policy approach it had taken already from the 1990 s onwards when liberalising the energy and electronic communication sectors. It can be submitted that the European Commission, in proposing its DSM regulation strategy and in setting the terms of its e-commerce sector inquiry, has paid insufficient attention so far to the various and complementary roles competition law can play in a more strictly regulated market environment. In an attempt to clarify the scope and role of EU competition law and its enforcement in a digital single market environment and to guarantee its coherent application with the proposed DSM regulations, this paper will reflect on the roles competition law can our should still play in this context. Proceeding in three parts, {{the first part of}} the paper will chart the interaction between competition law and market regulation proposals in the EU’s DSM context. Using examples from the geo-blocking, data portability and copyright proposals made, this part highlights how the EU institutions perceive the interaction between competition law provisions and market regulation in this context. On the basis of that analysis, the second part will frame the interaction between competition law and market regulation as perceived in the DSM strategy, by comparing it with earlier examples in the realm of energy and electronic communications. In doing so, this part will identify two important similarities (breaking up barriers to trade and facilitating cross-border competition) as well as two fundamental differences (absence of natural monopolies and of intensely state regulated sectors). Acknowledging those similarities and differences, it will be submitted, allows better to conceptualise the role of competition law in the particular DSM context. To that extent, the third part will present and analyse the tenability of three possible roles competition law can still play against this background. Assessing the advantages and limits of each approach, that part will <b>invite</b> <b>the</b> <b>Commission</b> to take a clearer stance regarding the choice of one of them. Peer reviewe...|$|E
