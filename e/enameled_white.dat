500|$|The sash of the Order was poppy red moire {{with narrow}} green borders, {{but under the}} knot, {{at the ends of}} this sash, these green borders as well as the ends of the sash were covered with gold {{metallic}} ribbon. Like the sash of the Order of the Garter this sash was worn from the left shoulder to the right hip. [...] The cross worn with this sash was a Maltese cross with narrow arms also <b>enameled</b> <b>white</b> strewn with numerous golden flames, with three straight rays between each arm, each point of the cross being tipped with a small gold ball. Between the two gold balls on the top arm of the cross was a three-dimensional gold representation of the Bavarian crown, by which the cross hung from its sash. In the center of the cross was a large round medallion consisting of a small golden representation of the conversion of Saint Hubert against a green enamel background and surrounded by a wide border in red enamel with the motto the order In trau vast in Gothic letters set with small diamonds.

After approval of the Ethics Committee, the parents signed an informed consent form and were interviewed about their educational level, economic classification of the family, nursing habits, use of toothpaste, access to dental service and other information. The children were clinically examined using the same codes and criteria established by the WHO (World Health Organization) and ADA (American Dental Association). The data were processed and analyzed with the Epi-info software program, version 3. 2, and Microsoft Excel. Fisher’s exact test (p < 0. 05) was applied to assess the association among the variables. The <b>enamel</b> <b>white</b> spot prevalence was 30. 8 % and the age group, duration of the bedtime milk feeding habit, age of initial practice of oral hygiene and presence of caries lesions with cavitation were considered statistically significant with regard to <b>enamel</b> <b>white</b> spot prevalence (p < 0. 05).

40|$|The damage {{promoted}} on {{two different}} kinds of enamelled specimens was evaluated. One was coated with a single layer of pyrolytic electrostatic powder enamel (referred to as black enamel), {{and the other was}} coated with ground coat wet <b>enamel</b> (<b>white</b> <b>enamel).</b> Specimens were cyclically subjected to the action of an oven cleaner and temperatures of about 250 °C. After a few cycles the surfaces lost their smooth, shiny appearance, revealing that some damage was induced during the treatment. Roughness measurements and electrochemical tests showed that the degradation of the coating was rather superficial and that the metal substrate was still very well protected. Further tests showed different performances {{depending on the type of}} coating. While the black enamel revealed some pits with brown corrosion products across the surface, indicating the onset of attack of the base metal, the <b>white</b> <b>enamel</b> displayed a surface that was highly porous compared with the untreated specimens. Potentiodynamic polarisation curves showed the presence of a pitting potential together with a hysteresis loop for the black enamel, indicating the presence of small pores providing access for electrolyte (chloride) to corrode the metal base. Conversely, polarisation curves for the <b>white</b> <b>enamel</b> only displayed higher values of passive current density, suggesting a difference in the dielectric properties of the enamels.
