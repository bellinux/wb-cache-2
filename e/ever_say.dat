[...] Montgomery chided the video for [...] "not making much sense" [...] but noted [...] "that hardly matters" [...] as [...] "Kesha has stumbled on a perfect formula for pop success: Don't think too big, or too much. Sometimes an elephant ride is just an elephant ride". His conclusion of the video and of Kesha herself was, [...] "It's {{a lot harder than}} you'd think to make something seem this effortless. Like I said, you can accuse Kesha of many things— but don't <b>ever</b> <b>say</b> she's not smart." ...|$|E
500|$|Strang never {{claimed to}} be the king of Beaver Island itself, nor of any other {{geographical}} entity. Rather, he {{claimed to be}} king over his church, which he saw as the true [...] "Kingdom of God" [...] prophesied in Scripture and destined to spread over all the earth. [...] Nor did Strang <b>ever</b> <b>say</b> that his [...] "kingdom" [...] supplanted United States sovereignty over Beaver Island. [...] However, since his sect was the main religious body on the isle, claiming the allegiance of most of its inhabitants, Strang often asserted authority even over non-Strangites on Beaver—which ultimately caused him and his followers a great deal of grief. [...] Furthermore, he and many of his disciples were accused of forcibly appropriating property and revenue on the island, which made him few friends among the non-Mormon [...] "gentiles." ...|$|E
500|$|On February 5, 2017, Gaga was the {{headliner}} of Super Bowl LI halftime {{show and}} [...] "Born This Way" [...] {{was part of}} the performance. Nico Lang from Salon noted that compared to other songs performed during the event, which were mostly shortened into a medley, Gaga chose to perform the biggest part of [...] "Born This Way", and [...] "her singing its lyrics made Gaga the first person to <b>ever</b> <b>say</b> the words 'lesbian', 'gay', 'bi', or 'transgender' at the Super Bowl." [...] Many other journalists highlighted the significance of singing the song at the Super Bowl, calling it a subtle political statement. In April 2017, Gaga performed [...] "Born This Way" [...] during both weeks of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. The song is also part of her current Joanne World Tour. After singing songs on the piano, she straps on a long white skirt for the performance of [...] "Born This Way".|$|E

500|$|... "Bye Bye" [...] {{served as}} the album's thirteenth track, and also {{composed}} by Carey and Stargate. An [...] "inspirational power ballad", it is influenced by R and pop music genres. The song is built on an understated and simple piano-driven melody, that is decorated with a soft bass-line. Lyrically, the song was described by critics as a [...] "larger than life anthem", and an [...] "inspirational lighter-in-the-air ballad", and finds Carey remembering both her father, {{as well as any}} lost loved ones. While the verses are dedicated to him, the chorus was written in a third-person point of view, for her fans: [...] "This is for my peoples who just lost somebody / Your best friend, your baby, your man or your lady / Put your hand way up high / We will never say bye / Mamas, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends and cousins / This is for my peoples who lost their grandmothers / Lift your hands to the sky / Because we won't <b>ever</b> <b>say</b> bye bye". While listing several forms of loss, Carey encourages to never let go, and always live with their memory, and put their hands up if they ever lost someone, 'cause we won't <b>ever</b> <b>say</b> bye bye'. Serving as the album's closing number, [...] "I Wish You Well" [...] was compared to the closing number on Mimi, [...] "Fly Like a Bird". Similarly, [...] "I Wish You Well" [...] incorporates gospel influence into its melody of [...] "rousing piano waltz", that [...] "extends forgiveness to those who have wronged her in the past and is pretty much interchangeable with its predecessors." [...] Extensively making use of the whistle register, she references Mottola in another light than [...] "Side Effects": [...] "'I Wish You Well's' message to Mottola is similarly striking. Accompanied by a piano and some multi-tracked backing vocals, Carey sings: [...] "Still bruised, still walk on eggshells / Same frightened child, hide to protect myself / But you can't manipulate me like before." [...] She then prescribes Bible study and says, [...] "I wish you well." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{the verses}} are {{dedicated}} to him, the chorus was written in a third-person point of view, for her fans: [...] "This is for my peoples who just lost somebody / Your best friend, your baby, your man or your lady / Put your hand way up high / We will never say bye / Mamas, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends and cousins / This is for my peoples who lost their grandmothers / Lift your hands to the sky / Because we won't <b>ever</b> <b>say</b> bye bye". As Carey sings the second chorus, she reverts to the singular conversation with her deceased father, however now revisiting 2005, [...] "And you {{never got a chance}} to see how good I've done / And you never got to see me back at No. 1", referencing her return to the top of music with The Emancipation of Mimi. The song does not feature a bridge, instead repeating the chorus twice, once in the same key as the rest of the song, while the other in a raised octave. During the last chorus, Carey's voice is doubled, with her regular tone voice singing softly over the piano chords, while her more prominent and higher pitched vocals are laid over it.|$|E
500|$|Debbage comments, [...] "One {{strength}} of Bradley Joseph {{as an artist}} has been his keen ability to write inspiring music with appropriately titled songs that express that thought non-verbally". [...] Joseph explained to Janus that, [...] "Through instrumental music, I'm allowed {{to come up with}} musical ideas that allow the listener to create their own impression of my song. If you add lyrics about a girl in the song, the listener doesn't have a choice of what the song is about, it's told to them. My musical writings allow me to express anything. [...] It's easier for me to tell a story of something I've encountered this way than to verbalize it. [...] And my feelings are explored more in my compositions compared to what I could <b>ever</b> <b>say</b> in a few sentences." [...] He believes that [...] "music allows a person to express their deepest thoughts, thoughts that cannot be expressed with just words." [...] He also believes that the spiritual aspect of creating is to [...] "find something deep within yourself that can only be created by you"..."Your spiritual self cannot be copied and that's why it's so significant in life and music", he says. [...] Parsons goes on to say, [...] "The influence of years of touring with Yanni is apparent in the richness of Joseph's sound, but his musical voice is his own." [...] Yanni once said, [...] "Bradley, your extreme sensitivity is your greatest gift". Joseph later realized what Yanni meant was that he needed that as a composer, that it was a crucial component [...] "to be sensitive to what you see {{and to be able to}} apply that to music".|$|E

2500|$|In {{terms of}} global {{interpretation}} of the council, Luciani wrote: [...] "The physiognomy {{and structure of the}} Catholic Church have been determined once and for all by the Lord and cannot be touched. If anything, superstructures can. Things that have not been determined by Christ, but were introduced by popes or councils or the faithful, can be changed, or eliminated today or tomorrow. Yesterday they might have introduced a certain number of dioceses, a certain way to lead missions, to educate priests, they might have chosen to follow certain cultural trends. Well, this can be changed and one can say [...] "the Church that comes out of the Council is still {{the same as it was}} yesterday, but renewed". No one can <b>ever</b> <b>say</b> [...] "We have a new Church, different from what it was".|$|E

I wish they had have." [...] Referring to the [...] "great economic storm" [...] currently under way in Ireland, he warned against excessive pessimism: [...] "Some gains have been lost, but in truth many remain. I dearly wish there was no crisis. I realise {{that it would have been}} better if some things had been done differently, but I will not denigrate the good that has been done," [...] he added.|$|E
