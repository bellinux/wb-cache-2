25|$|<b>I</b> <b>propose</b> <b>that</b> the {{government}} {{should get out of}} the business of marrying people and, instead, only give legal status to civil unions. The government should do this for both gay couples and straight couples and, leave marriage {{in the hands of the}} Church and other religious entities.|$|E

2500|$|Later, on December 7, 2005, Lieberman said, [...] "It is {{time for}} Democrats who {{distrust}} President Bush to acknowledge {{that he will be}} Commander-in-Chief for three more critical years, and that in matters of war we undermine Presidential credibility at our nationâ€™s peril. It {{is time for}} Republicans in the White House and Congress who distrust Democrats to acknowledge that greater Democratic involvement and support in the war in Iraq is critical to rebuilding the support of the American people that is essential to our success in that war. It is time for Americans and we their leaders to start working together again on the war on terrorism. To encourage that new American partnership, <b>I</b> <b>propose</b> <b>that</b> the President and the leadership of Congress establish a bipartisan Victory in Iraq Working Group, composed of members of both parties in Congress and high ranking national security officials of the Bush Administration." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{seemed as}} if our own safety demanded that we give some especial {{attention}} to the traitor, and <b>I</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> we consult with Darius at once.|$|R
60|$|Then Jacob {{suggested}} {{that the old man}} might have been detained against his will at headquarters, and <b>I</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> the lad go at once to learn if such was the case.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} so, {{if you were}} to make him a beetle and wedge, because he was a bad boy; but <b>I</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> you should make it for another reason, that is, to please him." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "'The Englishman {{is going}} to leave us, {{in a day or}} two. I have not {{forgotten}} what I owe him, and should like to make him a present. <b>I</b> <b>propose</b> <b>that</b> we search all the party thoroughly, today. From what we heard, some of them come from the ruby country, and are pretty sure to have gems concealed about them, or in their baggage. <b>I</b> <b>propose</b> <b>that</b> all the stones we find we will give to our friend.' ...|$|E
40|$|In this study, I {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} sleep deprivation on cheating behavior. <b>I</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> sleep deprivation results in cognitive depletion. Cognitive depletion should impair an individual's ability to reason against unethical impulses such as cheating. In addition, <b>I</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> moral disengagement as a personality trait affects {{the extent to which}} sleep deprivation is linked to cheating. Results from a laboratory study show that sleep deprivation is indeed associated with higher rates of cheating behavior. Additionally, this relationship is stronger among individuals who are higher in moral disengagement. These findings provide support towards the interactionist and person-situation models of ethical decision making. Both of these theoretical models state that situational antecedents and individual differences interact to influence outcomes of ethical behavior...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> she be {{anchored}} {{lest the}} wind set {{her on the}} beach; but Darius claimed {{that it was necessary}} for us to be ready to leave at a moment's notice, and promised to have an eye on the craft all the while we were absent.|$|R
60|$|It was {{the tone}} to take if I would be respected. Had <b>I</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> we should journey in company I {{should not have}} earned me the half of the {{deference}} which was accorded to my haughtily granted leave that they might follow me if they so chose.|$|R
60|$|VENABLES. Really, Comtesse, {{you make}} {{conversation}} difficult. To show that my intentions are innocent, Mrs. Shand, <b>I</b> <b>propose</b> <b>that</b> {{you choose the}} subject.|$|E

40|$|Welcome to {{this special}} edition of ITALICS, the journal of the HEA-ICS. I am honoured to have been asked to be guest editor of this issue.

6000|$|We {{felt that}} we had done enough for one afternoon, when we had done the House of Pansa, and <b>I</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> we should go and sit down in Congress Park {{and listen to the}} Troy band. I was not without the hope that it would play [...] "Washington Post." ...|$|R
5000|$|He added: [...] "After {{prayer and}} reflection, I summoned {{the courage to}} call up Chief Justice Hilario Davide Jr. about 5:30 a.m. {{to explain to him}} my apprehensions. <b>I</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>that,</b> to save the Constitution, he should swear in GMA (Arroyo) by 12 noon of that day."

6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} you what my idea is," [...] Reuben said. [...] "The horses are already worn out and, by the end of another day, they will be half mad with thirst. <b>I</b> <b>propose</b> <b>that</b> we take two days' supply for ourselves, in our water bottles; and that we push forward on foot, sending two of the constables back to the stream, with our horses. <b>I</b> <b>propose</b> <b>that</b> we should push forward tonight. I expect the track we are {{following}} is the true one, and the stars will do as a guide.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have made}} no insinuations," [...] Julian replied. [...] "At the same time, before we proceed to extremities, <b>I</b> <b>propose</b> <b>that</b> we spend half an hour {{studying}} the originals." ...|$|E
60|$|As {{it was now}} pretty late in the afternoon, <b>I</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> Pomona should {{postpone}} {{the rest of her}} narrative until evening. She said that {{there was nothing else to}} tell that was very particular; and I did not feel as if I could stand anything more just now, even if it was very particular.|$|R
60|$|The {{officer and}} the sailors {{went over the}} rail on being told {{that they were to}} change quarters; but it was {{necessary}} that the traitors be brought from the hold, and <b>I</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> Darius and Jim Freeman attend to such duty, for I had no desire to set eyes on Elias Macomber again.|$|R
40|$|About {{a decade}} ago, <b>I</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> t-loops, the lariat {{structures}} adopted by many eukaryotic telomeres, could {{explain how the}} transition from circular to linear chromosomes was successfully negotiated by early eukaryotes.

6000|$|... "Oh, no!" [...] replied Glynn. [...] "We must be up {{and away}} in an hour at farthest. So, as I see you're about done with your luxurious supper, <b>I</b> <b>propose</b> <b>that</b> you lie down to rest." ...|$|E
40|$|Few studies {{examine how}} {{institutional}} logics evolve {{over time in}} fields where the entry and behaviour of actors is heavily regulated. Building on {{a case study of}} the US drug industry, <b>I</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> regulatory logics evolve through a process of endogenously-driven change and suggest how this model may be helpful in understanding processes of institutional change...|$|R
60|$|When he was {{come to an}} end of the story, and Simon Kenton was not one to {{use more}} words than were necessary, <b>I</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> he go with me to my home, for by this time it was near to noon, and I had {{suddenly}} lost all desire to continue the work of setting traps.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not wish}} to {{interfere}} with your movements," [...] Maraton said calmly. [...] "Where you are is nothing to me. <b>I</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> you should remain away from London simply because I fancied that it would be easier for you to observe the conditions which exist between us. So long as you remember them, however, your whereabouts are indifferent to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come," [...] he said, [...] "the affair is {{not worth}} a quarrel. I ask you no questions. Only since we are here <b>I</b> <b>propose</b> <b>that</b> we test the cooking of the good Annette. We will lunch together." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Thorny used to 'confound!' every thing, so <b>I</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> {{he should}} whistle instead; {{and now he}} {{sometimes}} pipes up so suddenly and shrilly that it makes me jump. How would that do, instead of swearing?" [...] proposed Miss Celia, not the least surprised at the habit of profanity, which the boy could hardly help learning among his former associates.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> Hiram Griffin {{should remain}} at my home {{until we were}} done with {{this part of the}} business; but he, having found us so readily, was not willing we should give him the slip even for a moment, and {{therefore}} it was we doubled the danger of being brought to an accounting by the patrol, in taking him across to Hull street.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> {{we should}} {{walk to the}} other end of the line, using the profaned name, not only without gusto, but with {{positive}} distaste.
