40|$|<b>In</b> <b>our</b> <b>previous</b> <b>study</b> we {{have shown}} that the female connectomes have {{significantly}} better, deep graph-theoretical parameters, related to superior "connectivity", than the connectome of the males. Since the average female brain is smaller than the average male brain, one cannot rule out that the significant advantages are due to the size- and not to the sex-differences in the data. To filter out the possible brain-volume related artifacts, we have chosen 36 small male and 36 large female brains such that all the brains in the female set are larger than all the brains in the male set. For the sets, we have computed the corresponding braingraphs and computed numerous graph-theoretical parameters. We have found that (i) the small male brains lack the better connectivity advantages shown <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>previous</b> <b>study</b> for female brains in general; (ii) in numerous parameters, the connectomes computed from the large-brain females, still have the significant, deep connectivity advantages, demonstrated <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>previous</b> <b>study.</b> Comment: arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv: 1501. 0072...|$|R
