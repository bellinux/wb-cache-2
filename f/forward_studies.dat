A threshold of two moderate exacerbations or one hospitalization is used to define high-risk patients. The <b>FORWARD</b> <b>study</b> was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial that compared 48 weeks’ treatment with extrafine beclomethasone dipropionate plus formoterol fumarate (BDP-FF) versus FF in severe COPD patients with a history of one or more exacerbations in the previous year. The new GOLD 2017 recommendations mean that many patients in the <b>FORWARD</b> <b>study</b> are now reclassified as GOLD B. We conducted a post hoc analysis of the <b>FORWARD</b> <b>study,</b> in order to investigate the effects of extrafine BDP/FF in patients with one exacerbation in the previous year, focusing on those categorized as group B using the GOLD 2017 definition. The analysis showed a 35 % reduction in exacerbation rate with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) + long-acting β-agonist (LABA) versus LABA. We propose that ICS-LABA treatment is a therapeutic option for COPD patients with one exacerbation in the previous year. Keywords: COPD, GOLD B, GOLD 2017, exacerbations, corticosteroi...|$|R

50|$|In 1993, the The European Commission {{published}} a White Paper on « Growth, Competitiveness, employment: The {{challenges of the}} 21st century». The <b>Forward</b> <b>Studies</b> Unit coordinated this study. It was announcing a shift to a post-industrial information society and was proposing very daring reforms in taxation, education, and of the European development model itself. This new vision proposed by Jacques Delors himself, has been politely refused by the EU Head of State, in the European Council of December 1993.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} the 18th century, {{law studies}} were added (with the {{creation}} of the School of Law and Social Sciences), and from this time <b>forward</b> <b>studies</b> at the university were no longer exclusively theological. Following a conflict between the Franciscans and the secular clergy over the direction of the university, the house of study was renamed (by royal decree) to Royal University of Saint Charles and Our Lady of Monserrat. With this new name the university acquired the double title of Royal and Pontifical, and Monsignor Gregorio Funes was appointed president. With these changes, the Franciscans were replaced by the secular clergy as leaders of the university.|$|E
5000|$|Since the mid-1990s, Olivier De Schutter {{has been}} {{involved}} in various capacities in the debates on improving governance in the EU, and on fundamental rights in the EU. In 1995-1997, he co-organized a seminar on reforming governance in the EU with the <b>Forward</b> <b>Studies</b> Unit of the European Commission, a seminar that later, following the fall of the Santer Commission, was influential in shaping the White Paper on Governance published in July 2001 by the European Commission. Between 2002 and 2007, he coordinated the EU Network of Independent Experts on Fundamental Rights, a high-level group of experts established {{at the request of the}} European Parliament to provide recommendations to the EU institutions on the implementation of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and to report on the situation of fundamental rights in the EU. In 2013, he was appointed a member of the EU's Fundamental Rights Agency's Scientific Committee.|$|E

He {{lives with his}} wife Isabelle near Brussels.Initially, he studied mathematics, {{philosophy}} and theology (Ph.D.) and became a Catholic priest. He presented a doctorate in Rome (Pontifical Oriental Institute), in Russian and Greek theology, on Nikolai Berdyaev’s early writings in Russian, since his discovery of Marxism until his conversion to orthodoxy" [...] (Pontifical Oriental Institute, Rome).After his marriage, he was for ten years (1990-1999), member of the <b>Forward</b> <b>Studies</b> Unit of the European Commission, created by Jacques Delors, where he focused on the meaning of European integration and created the programme The soul of Europe. He had the opportunity to travel a lot and meet worldwide government officials and advisors in Europe, the U.S., China, Japan, or in India. Some were aware of the shift of civilization in which we are engaged globally, but these visionaries were a minority.|$|E
5000|$|As {{a member}} of the <b>Forward</b> <b>Studies</b> Unit, I had the great honour to meet with a genius thinker in the Silicon Valley: Willis Harman. According to Willis Harman in the late Middle Ages, the civilization shifted to the Renaissance because Copernicus {{proposed}} a new way of conceiving the Earth and the sky. Similarly today, the culture shift is happening around a new definition of consciousness and matter. We are leaving metaphysics [...] "M1", which says that matter exists and that consciousness emanates from matter and some quantic scientists are already in a new metaphysics [...] "M3" [...] who discovers that consciousness is first and allows the emergence of matter. According to Harman, this conceptual earthquake, transforms the scientific method itself. And the [...] "new science" [...] is increasingly similar to the latest developments in quantum physics. Harman considers that this transmodern science resembles the vision of Humanity’s Perennial Wisdom and that opposition between science and philosophy will disappear slowly.|$|E
50|$|Maria João Rodrigues {{remained}} {{close to}} Prime Minister Guterres, and was appointed special adviser and Head of the Prime Minister's <b>Forward</b> <b>Studies</b> Unit in 1998. In this capacity, {{she played a}} dramatic role during the Portuguese Presidency of the European Union, in the first semester of 2000. The Portuguese Presidency notably succeeded in securing a compromise on the so-called Lisbon Strategy, a comprehensive plan that was aimed at boosting growth and employment level in the EU. The strategy was adopted at an extraordinary European Council meeting in Lisbon in March 2000, a meeting in which Maria João Rodrigues acted as a sherpa for the Prime Minister. She notably contributed to build a compromise between the delegations of the British and French governments, by resorting to the open method of coordination.Maria João Rodrigues continued to monitor closely the developments of the Lisbon Strategy, in particular as Special Advisor to the Luxembourg Presidency of the European Union for the Mid-term Review of the Lisbon Strategy (2005) and special advisor to the European Commission and Jean-Claude Juncker on the Lisbon strategy.|$|E

30|$|In 1989, the Commission {{established}} a <b>Forward</b> <b>Studies</b> Unit, a small ‘think tank’ staffed with EU officials and reporting {{directly to the}} President, Jacques Delors. This was run along traditional French lines as a cellule de prospective. It {{was attached to the}} President’s private office and produced a series of forward-looking reflections on policies of a general nature. They are not restricted to science and technology developments and included for example scenarios for Russia or East Asia. Delors’ successor, Romano Prodi, converted the cellule into a ‘policy advisory group’ without foresight activities.|$|E
40|$|Original title: De toekomst van de mantelzorg Like earlier {{reports of}} <b>forward</b> <b>studies</b> of {{informal}} care, this report once again {{shows that there}} {{is unlikely to be}} a serious discrepancy in the future (up to 2030) between the numbers of recipients and providers of informal care. Earlier SCP reports on informal care have drawn attention to the often problematic issue of combining paid work with providing informal care. Those reports have highlighted the potential conflict between two policy objectives, namely 'more people in work for longer' and 'more responsibility for citizens for looking after members of their networks'. This study quantifies that dichotomy. The figures show that the rising labour participation rate - which the government regards as necessary to counteract the shrinking labour force - comes with a price in the form of loss of informal support. That loss can lead to greater demands being placed on professional care, unless leave arrangements are improved...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} tools in phenomenological studies is the {{identification}} of correlations among different processes. This is essentially effected in retrospective with the specific aim of finding a positive result, and {{that leads to a}} parameter optimization which introduces a bias, so far only marginally considered, in the significance level of the results. If the correlation can be validated in a forward study in which parameters are kept fixed, such a bias is irrelevant. Unfortunately, <b>forward</b> <b>studies</b> are often infeasible for either cost or intrinsic reasons. This is the case of geophysics, due to the comparatively long time scale of recurrence of the phenomena. Unbiased estimates can be obtained in retrospective if each of the optimal choices is properly identified and accounted for. An estimate of the bias is made in a specific case, which can be written in closed form. While simulation confirms its good performance, the latter shows that apparently highly significant retrospective correlations may be insignificant...|$|E
30|$|The results paint {{a picture}} of clear water {{infrastructure}} preferences against a backdrop of highly inadequate pre-earthquake water access conditions. Though most of the study participants relied on decentralized sources prior to the earthquake, more than four fifths of the survey respondents expressed a preference for a centralized water system going <b>forward.</b> <b>Study</b> participants specifically cited a piped water system for cooking, clothes washing, hygienic purposes and drinking. However, and despite the clear preference among survey participants for piped water systems, the interviews and the workshop suggest that local stakeholders see this piped water system as part of a broader, integrated solution to the region’s water problems.|$|R

40|$|Background Clinical {{outcomes}} in large patient populations from real-world clinical practice with a next-generation self-expanding transcatheter aortic valve are lacking. Objectives This {{study sought to}} document the clinical and device performance outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with a next-generation, self-expanding transcatheter heart valve (THV) system in patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) in routine clinical practice. Methods The FORWARD (CoreValve Evolut R <b>FORWARD)</b> <b>study</b> is a prospective, single-arm, multinational, multicenter, observational study. An independent clinical events committee adjudicated safety endpoints based on Valve Academic Research Consortium- 2 definitions. An independent echocardiographic core laboratory evaluated all echocardiograms. From January 2016 to December 2016, TAVR with the next-generation self-expanding THV was attempted in 1, 038 patients with symptomatic, severe AS at 53 centers on 4 continents. Results Mean age was 81. 8 Â± 6. 2 years, 64. 9 % were women, the mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality was 5. 5 Â± 4. 5 %, and 33. 9 % of patients were deemed frail. The repositioning feature of the THV was applied in 25. 8 % of patients. A single valve was implanted in the proper anatomic location in 98. 9 % of patients. The mean aortic valve gradient was 8. 5 Â± 5. 6 mm Hg, and moderate or severe aortic regurgitation was 1. 9 % at discharge. All-cause mortality was 1. 9 %, and disabling stroke occurred in 1. 8 % at 30 days. The expected-to-observed early surgical mortality ratio was 0. 35. A pacemaker was implanted in 17. 5 % of patients. Conclusions TAVR using the next-generation THV is clinically safe and effective for treating older patients with severe AS at increased operative risk.
