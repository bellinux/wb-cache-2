40|$|The inflationary {{implications}} of the <b>Euro-currency</b> market {{continue to be a}} source of contention and misunderstanding. One view on the matter is that the market, having some potential for net credit creation, adds dangerously to the rate of world credit expansion.

The author sides with the latter argument, arguing that considerable evidence can be found to show that the growth of the <b>Euro-currency</b> market represents to a significant extent a substitution for, rather than an addition to, credit expansion in other forms. <b>Euro-currency</b> credits appear to be substitutes for four alternative types of accommodation: domestic credit to non-banks, domestic “monetary base” creation, foreign money markets and forward exchange markets.   JEL: E 31, E 44, E 51 </p...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse the {{implications}} of the euro for the international reserves in the Eurosystem. Two conceptually different effects of the changeover have to be distinguished: a technical effect that largely arises as a matter of accounting, and a behavioural effect that {{stems from the fact that}} the optimal demand of the aggregate Eurosystem is not equal to the sum of the optimal country levels. The technical effect arises from two main sources: the abolishment of the ECU-creating mechanism, and the redefinition of international reserves which precludes (former) reserves that were denominated in <b>euro-currencies.</b> As a result the average reserves of the Eurosystem in 1999 amounted to $ 287 billion, considerably less than in 1998 ($ 345 billion). We then derive a reserve demand function for the aggregate Eurosystem using panel data estimation techniques and simulate reserve demand for the situation after the regime shift. The optimal aggregate level of reserves turns out to be some $ 188 billion, which implies excess reserves in the Eurosystem amounting to approximately $ 100 billion in the year 1999. We go on by proposing a key by which this excess could be allocated to the individual countries taking the asymmetric distribution of reserves in the Eurosystem into account. Finally we classify and enumerate the proposals for making use of the estimated reserve overhang. (author's abstract) Series: EI Working Papers / Europainstitu...|$|R

This paper {{presents}} a coherent nonlinear interest rate model that incorporates {{the dynamics of}} the error correction specification into the traditional term structure model.

40|$|BIS {{statistics}} on international bank lending, collected by central banks {{under the auspices}} of the <b>Euro-currency</b> Standing Committee at the BIS since the late 1970 s, have long been used to monitor risk exposures in the international financial system. For instance, these statistics provided clear and timely warnings about the scale and nature of external bank debt accumulation before al intermediation has evolved over the years, the scope of these statistics has been gradually broadened beyond bank lending to cover debt securities, syndicated credit facilities, and derivatives. These statistics are being used increasingly in economic research on questions related to global financial stability. However, it had been clear to us for some time that different researchers using these statistics were not always aware of each other's work. The BIS's Committee on the Global Financial System (the successor to the <b>Euro-currency</b> Standing Committee) therefore decided to sponsor a workshop of research based on the BIS international financial statistics.

40|$|Preface This volume {{contains}} papers {{produced for}} the <b>Euro-currency</b> Standing Committee {{in a joint}} effort by researchers at several central banks. The papers address measurement of market risk, market dynamics, market liquidity, and the role that information plays in determining market outcomes in unsettled circumstances. The Committee believes that the research undertaken will {{be of interest to}} a wider audience, including market participants and the academic community. In publishing the papers, the Committee hopes to stimulate further research in these areas. The papers represent the views of the authors and not necessarily those of the central banks with which they are affiliated nor that of the <b>Euro-currency</b> Standing Committee. In July 1996, the BIS published a report of a working group of the Committee, chaired by Shinichi Yoshikuni of the Bank of Japan, which recommended the establishment of a reporting system on activities in global derivatives markets. That reporting system is to be implemented in 1998. The Report recognised that data on derivatives positions, while indispensable for tracking changes in the size and structure of derivatives markets over time, would shed limited light on how overall portfolio values and market conditions might change in the face of price shocks. The behaviour of markets in the face of shocks has long been an area of fundamental central bank interest and responsibility. When the papers in this volume were discussed by the Committee in May 1997, the Committee accepted the researchers' conclusion that this research did not establish an adequate technical basis or adequate justification for collecting aggregate market risk data. However, the Committee decided to encourage continuing work on other aspects of market behaviour addressed in these papers. In particular, in line with its mandate to monitor sources of potential instability in financial markets, the Committee will continue to encourage and review research on market functioning and price dynamics under stress.

40|$|Preface The Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS), known until 1999 as the <b>Euro-Currency</b> Standing Committee, {{serves as}} a {{discussion}} forum for the central bank community on financial stability questions. The CGFS has frequently been asked to examine the potential implications of innovations in global financial market practices. Recent projects by CGFS working groups have concerned the functioning of international interbank markets, financial derivatives and the systemic consequences of standard risk management practices. Last year, the CGFS decided to organise a working group to take a preliminary look at the possible implications {{of the use of}} electronic trading platforms for the functioning of global financial markets. The migration of financial trading to electronic platforms merits monitoring because of possible system-wide consequences. The Working Group was chaired by Jos Heuvelman of De Nederlandsche Bank. The Committee was most grateful to Mr Heuvelman and his colleagues for their careful work. The publication of this report is intended to contribute to the general understanding of developments in global financial markets.

40|$|ABSTRACT This {{report is}} the result of a coordinated {{research}} effort by the central banks of Canada, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States and the Bank for International Settlements on the determinants of market liquidity and on how central banks and other public authorities influence these determinants. Following a decision by the <b>Euro-currency</b> Standing Committee (now the Committee on the Global Financial System) in December 1997, a group of central bank economists and market analysts, under the chairmanship of the Bank of Japan, conducted this research from February 1998 to March 1999. As part of the study, staff from the central banks and/or government debt offices of all of the G- 10 countries participated in a survey on the structure of government securities markets. The report consists of an overview note (Part 1) and eighteen individual papers on various aspects of market liquidity (Part 2). The overview note {{is the result}} of extensive discussions among the members of the study group, taking into account insights obtained from the individual papers. An appendix to Part 1 summarises the results of the government securities market survey. The individual papers provide the theoretical and empirical bases for the discussions of the study group. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{overseas}} {{assets and}} liabilities of UK banks account for over 50 % of the overseas {{assets and liabilities}} of all UK residents and almost 50 % of UK banks' total assets and liabilities. They are {{much larger than the}} overseas assets of banks in other developed countries. This paper adopts an institutional, theoretical and empirical approach to explain the large size of these overseas assets. We find that over 80 % of these assets and liabilities are accounted for by foreign-owned UK banks and their large size may be traced {{to the development of the}} <b>Euro-currency</b> markets in London in the late 1950 s and 1960 s. Although net overseas bank assets can, in principle, be explained, the gross assets are more problematic. The theoretical literature is quite limited and the most appropriate macroeconomic framework would be complex and difficult to apply. We therefore examine some simpler empirical hypotheses about the size of these assets and liabilities but find that they are rejected by the data. We conclude that while an institutional and theoretical approach reveals the nature of UK banks' overseas assets and liabilities and suggests some of their determinants, developing a satisfactory empirical model is quite difficult.

40|$|Luxembourg {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} financial centers in the world. Initially associated with international syndicated loans, euro-bonds and <b>euro-currency</b> markets, Luxembourg has developed as a center for private banking and is currently the second largest center for the domiciliation of investment funds in the world after the US - with a portfolio equivalent to about sixty times the country’s GDP -, and the first captive reinsurance market in the European Union. As in many other financial centers, the interbank market plays an important role. This partly reflects intra-group operations of foreign banks using their Luxembourg branches and subsidiaries to adjust their liquidity position. More generally, Luxembourg has attracted foreign banks seeking to benefit from its favorable regulatory framework, political stability, language skills of the local workforce and the agglomeration of specialized skills in accounting and legal services. The importance of the financial sector in Luxembourg implies that a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model with explicit modeling of the financial sector is indispensable in order to properly take into account the interaction between the financial and the real sector in the economy and the interconnectedness between different financial institutional sectors (e. g. commercial banks and investment funds). Explicit modeling of the financial sector also allows for an analysis of how the economy might respond to financial shocks.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} order of {{integration}} of EuroSterling interest rates by employing techniques that can allow for a structural break under the null and/or alternative hypothesis of the unit-root tests. In light of these results, we investigate the cointegrating relationship implied by the single, linear expectations hypothesis of the term structure of interest rates employing two techniques, one of which allows {{for the possibility of}} a break in the mean of the cointegrating relationship. The aim of the paper is to investigate whether or not the interest rate series can be viewed as I(1) processes and furthermore, to consider whether there has been a structural break in the series. We also determine whether, if we allow for a break in the cointegration analysis, the results are consistent with those obtained when a break is not allowed for. The main results reported in this paper support the conjecture that the ‘short’ <b>Euro-currency</b> rates are characterised as I(1) series that exhibit a structural break on or near Black Wednesday, 16 September 1992, whereas the ‘long’ rates are I(1) series that do not support the presence of a structural break. The evidence from the cointegration analysis suggests that tests of the expectations hypothesis based on data sets that include the ERM crisis period, or a period that includes a structural break, might be problematic if the structural break is not explicitly taken into account in the testing framework. ...|$|E
40|$|State countercyclical {{financial}} interventionism {{is conceived}} {{here as a}} permanenet intervention of a state into the economy of a country by means of financial instruments directed at preventing economic fluctuations. In a market economy financial instruments are easier to assimilate than administrative and regulative instruments. The Italian State tries to improve the economic balance of the country by manipulating the financial flows. Thus it prevents business fluctuations of national economy. The possibilities of the State exerting influence on {{the economy of the}} country depend on social and economic doctrines adopted by the governing elites and on institutional and administrative infrastructure. In the article the Italian economy has been divided into two basic markets: money and short-term credit market and capital and long-term credit market. The policy of direct refinancing, the regulation of obligatory reserve, the policy of open market and the control of foreign financial relations have been analyzed. The analyses of empirical data justifies the conclusion that financial instruments at the State disposal played small role in moderating the business fluctuations of national economy. Competition among banks, internationalization of bank systems, widening the specialization of banks, the emergence of <b>Euro-currency</b> market are among the most important factors reducing the effectiveness of the State financial policy aimed at preventing business fluctuations of economy. Such a policy is more efficient in times of economic expansion than during depression.

40|$|Adapting the <b>euro-currency</b> implies {{transmitting}} {{the national}} monetary policy to European Central Bank. This implies that a nation {{can no longer}} use the monetary policy to dampen or to stimulate the economy. A high rate of inflation is destructive to an economy while a low rate of inflation can be beneficial to a limited extent. EMU has a task to ensure the stable rate of inflation at two percent; hence the inflation levels of its member states have to converge. If the inflation of the EMU member state is at target level then the credibility of ECB will be achieved. And the inflation expectations will be low. But since the adaption of euro as the single currency, inflation levels have diverged from each other. And this is worsened by the financial crisis in 2008.   Aside from that, what other factors affect the differences in inflation level and {{what might be the}} economic consequences waiting for the future of Euro-countries? The data used in this study ranges from year 1993 to 2015.

These countries are Austria, Belgium, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. By using the method Ordinary least squares, I identify that debt problems of Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain were one of the responsible to this inflation differential problem. The effect of this on countries with high level of inflation might be a strict fiscal policy, meaning budget cuts and increased tax rate. ...|$|E

First, it was to coordinate a survey of OTC derivatives dealers designed to develop a clear and comprehensive understanding of existing policies and procedures for documenting, processing and settling OTC transactions and for managing the associated counterparty risks. Secondly, it was to identify any weaknesses in practices that appear to exacerbate counterparty risks significantly or even possibly pose risks to the financial system generally, and to consider changes in practices, including new services, that could mitigate those risks. The study group coordinated interviews with 30 leading dealers in OTC derivatives, including two or more from each of the G- 10 countries. Overall, the results of the interviews indicate that practices for processing trades and managing counterparty risks are broadly similar in all the G- 10 countries. Standard legal agreements and confirmation templates are used to document most transactions. Transaction processing, from data capture through to confirmation and settlement, is increasingly automated, although the more structured transactions still usually require manual intervention. Netting and, to a growing extent, collateral agreements are used to mitigate counterparty credit risks. Finally, the vast majority of OTC transactions are settled bilaterally between the counterparties, rather than through clearing houses. A potential weakness in practices that was identified in the interviews was the existence of significant backlogs of unsigned master agreements and outstanding confirmations. The degree to which risks are exacerbated by these practices cannot be reliably assessed {{on the basis of the}} interview results. Given the size of some of the reported backlogs, this clearly deserves further attention. The study group recommends that both derivatives counterparties and prudential supervisors review the backlogs, assess the risks entailed and take appropriate steps to ensure that the risks are adequately controlled. A development that the study group believes could significantly mitigate risks in OTC derivatives transactions is the rapidly expanding use of collateral. However, to ensure that the benefits concerned are realised, counterparties must effectively manage the liquidity, legal, custody and operational risks of using collateral. The study group recommends that counterparties carefully assess these risks and that prudential supervisors consider developing supervisory guidance in this area. The expansion of clearing houses for OTC derivatives may also reduce counterparty risks. The study group recommends that counterparties assess the benefits of clearing, taking into account the effectiveness of the clearing house's risk management procedures and the effects of clearing on credit risks on uncleared contracts. National authorities should ensure that there are no unnecessary legal or regulatory impediments to clearing and that clearing houses adopt effective risk management safeguards.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is comprised}} of three essays. The first essay is an empirical examination into determining which spot rate processes are well suited to capturing {{the dynamics of the}} term structure of interest rates. The second essay explores a relatively new 2 ̆ 7 Price Deflator 2 ̆ 7 approach to modeling the term structure of interest rates. The final essay shows how one can recover the market 2 ̆ 7 s attitude towards risk from the prices of S 2 ̆ 6 P 500 options. ^ In the first essay, a one factor partial equilibrium model of the term structure is presented. The model shows that changes in the short-term rate are a function of the yield curve at the origin, the market price of risk, and a diffusion coefficient equal to the change in volatility of bond returns. The results for the U. S. using <b>Euro-currency</b> yield data show that the square root volatility process is the best model. Also, it appears that the market price of risk should be allowed to vary with the level of interest rates. ^ The second essay shows that any model of the term structure is in essence a model of the behavior of the marginal utility of consumption of the representative investor, which we refer to as the price deflator. Here, the instantaneous risk-free interest rate is shown to be equal to the expected growth rate of the price deflator. We also obtain solutions for price deflators that are implied by some common spot rate processes and demonstrate how the approach can be used within a Monte Carlo framework to price an interest rate contingent claim. ^ In the third essay, the insights of Varian (1988) are used to derive the Pratt-Arrow measures of absolute and relative risk aversion. The results indicate that during the sample period option traders displayed increasing absolute risk aversion and increasing relative risk aversion. We also track the markets risk aversion over time by creating a 2 ̆ 2 Risk Aversion Index. 2 ̆ 2 For the six month period between June and November 1995 we find that the market 2 ̆ 7 s risk appetite gradually increased. ...|$|E

As a follow-up to previous efforts relating to issues of risk measurement and management, the CGFS decided, in March 2000, {{to set up a}} Task Force to organise a global census of stress tests in use at major financial institutions. The findings of the Task Force, as detailed in this report, were discussed at the March 2001 meeting of the CGFS. The publication of the report is intended to contribute to the general understanding of the use of stress tests as a market risk management tool. For individual financial institutions, the survey data are expected to provide a useful benchmark for assessing their own stress test programmes against those of all surveyed firms, a sampling of financial firms including internationally active and global financial institutions. In addition, the Committee recognised the potential usefulness of survey information collected over time for the market-monitoring programme that it conducts {{at the request of the}} Governors of the G 10 central banks. In this connection, it was noted that survey results could provide useful insights into market participants' views on the sources and nature of potential future stress for global financial markets. In the future, having such information could assist the development of profiles of risk taking in financial markets. The Task Force was chaired by Alain Duchateau of the Banque de France/Commission Bancaire. He joins with the Committee in expressing appreciation for the co-operation of the surveyed banks with the Task Force. The Committee believes that the census is an excellent example of a co-operative effort between central banks and market participants. The survey responses can provide information that is valuable for the firms' own risk management purposes. They also can be used to usefully supplement standard sources of market information. The CGFS continues to be interested in this topic. Consequently, I would like to invite comments both on the findings of the report, as well as on the likely costs and benefits of possible follow-up survey efforts.

40|$|The {{collection}} of comprehensive and reliable statistics on derivatives markets was advocated by central banks in October 1992, when the Governors {{of the central}} banks of the Group of Ten (G- 10) countries released the report entitled "Recent Developments in International Interbank Relations" (the Promisel Report). This {{was followed by a}} report on "Issues of Measurement Related to Market Size and Macroprudential Risks in Derivatives Markets" (the Brockmeijer Report), which was published in February 1995. The latter report identified central banks' information requirements with regard to derivatives markets and proposed two initiatives towards addressing them: a comprehensive survey of derivatives markets conducted relatively infrequently, and a system for collecting statistics more regularly from a small number of leading international dealers. The proposal in the Brockmeijer Report for a comprehensive survey culminated in the April 1995 Central Bank Survey Of Derivatives Market Activity. The survey was conducted by central banks and monetary authorities in 26 countries, in conjunction with the Bank for International Settlements and with the cooperation of the international financial community. The results of the survey, which are described in detail in "Central Bank Survey of Foreign Exchange and Derivatives Market Activity" (BIS, May 1996), provided information on several important aspects of these markets which had previously been unavailable. Nevertheless, in view of the rapid development of global financial markets, it must be concluded that infrequent surveys are not sufficient to provide a timely picture of many aspects of derivatives activity. Against this background, the <b>Euro-currency</b> Standing Committee of the central banks of the G- 10 countries (ECSC) last year asked a Working Group to develop a proposal for the more regular {{collection of}} derivatives statistics. The Group, which was chaired by Shinichi Yoshikuni of the Bank of Japan, delivered its report to the G- 10 Governors in July 1996. The present report summarises the group's principal findings and recommendations. It is being released in order to finalise, with the input of market participants and supervisors, a framework for the regular collection of derivatives market data to be implemented at the end of 1997. It also recommends that central bank experts examine whether it is desirable to conduct another global survey of derivatives markets in conjunction with the next foreign exchange market survey, envisaged in 1998. In addition, the report provides an initial discussion of possible routes to monitoring price risks and exposures in international financial markets in a broader context than derivative alone. These systemic aspects of financial markets have long been a concern of central banks, but techniques for monitoring them have not been explored in detail either theoretically or quantitatively. After an introductory section, Part II of the report reviews the results of the April 1995 survey and assesses the implications of the survey results and participants' experiences for the regular reporting effort. Part III describes the Working Group's proposed reporting framework for derivatives activity and presents motivations for the specific components of the framework. Part IV attempts to address some of the broader issues relating to central bank monitoring of the financial system, and is intended to stimulate research and discussion on these topics in the financial community as well as in central bank and supervisory circles. Each of these sections is meant to serve as a self-contained unit. ...|$|E
40|$|Executive Summary The Asian crisis {{highlighted}} {{deficiencies in}} the availability of information relating to the on and off-balance-sheet foreign currency activities of central banks and other public sector entities. This led the G- 10 Governors to ask the <b>Euro-currency</b> Standing Committee to establish a working group to develop a disclosure framework to address these shortcomings. Specifically, the group was asked to identify the statistical information that would enable markets to better assess the authorities' foreign currency liquidity position. This position comprises the foreign exchange resources {{at the disposal of}} the authorities that are easily mobilisable in times of need and the potential drains on those resources associated with the authorities' short-term foreign currency liabilities. The group was also asked to report on the most suitable framework for public disclosure, the specific form and content of the information to be released and the additional practical steps necessary to implement the chosen strategy. In its deliberations the group recognised that improvements in disclosure practices by G- 10 countries could help to encourage similar behaviour in emerging market countries. The analysis and recommendations of the working group should be assessed in the context of initiatives relating to disclosure currently under way in other forums. These include the work of a working party on transparency and accountability commissioned by a group of finance ministers and central bank governors from 22 economies (the "Willard Group") and planned steps by the IMF Executive Board to strengthen the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). In recognition of these initiatives, an IMF representative was {{invited to participate in the}} working group and information on disclosure practices was shared with the Willard Group working party. A representative from the European Central Bank (ECB) was also asked to participate in the group. The working group is of the opinion that a significant move towards enhanced disclosure is justified as regards both the content and the timeliness of the information. This conclusion was reached on the basis of a review of current disclosure practices in relation to the liquidity concept outlined in previous discussions among Governors and a cost/benefit analysis of such a step. Prevailing practices generally fall well short of providing the relevant information, particularly as concerns the potential short-term drains on reserves. As most recently highlighted by the Asian crisis, the failure to disclose the forward book of the monetary authorities is one important example. The main benefits of enhanced disclosure would be to improve the accountability of the authorities and the scope for markets to exercise financial discipline. This, in turn, could help to induce an earlier correction of unsustainable policies and allow market participants to form a more accurate view of the condition of individual countries, thereby also possibly limiting contagion. It was noted that effective market discipline mechanisms also require an appropriate framework for disclosure and reporting by private sector entities. Differing views were expressed in this regard and the group acknowledged that this issue deserved further analysis. The group weighed the possible benefits of greater transparency against some potential costs. These were seen as being primarily associated with reduced operational flexibility to intervene covertly in order to counteract exchange market pressures, with the uncertainties involved in the transition towards a more demanding disclosure standard and with the logistical burdens of implementation. The specific recommendations of the group take the form of: a "disclosure template" outlining the content of the information to be disclosed; prescribed standards of timeliness, including both periodicity and disclosure lags; a timetable for implementation; and a proposal for further work on disclosure standards for private market participants. The disclosure template, summarised below, has three distinguishing features. Firstly, it aims to be as comprehensive as possible with respect to the coverage of both institutions and financial instruments. As regards institutions, conceptually the template is intended to apply to all the public sector entities that would be responsible for, or involved in, counteracting currency crises. In practice, this should at least include the monetary authorities, defined here to include both the central bank and the central government (excluding social security), but depending on institutional arrangements could extend to other public sector entities. As regards financial instruments, the template attempts to cover all the relevant on and off-balance-sheet liquid assets and short-term liabilities. Comprehensiveness is designed to provide a meaningful picture and to limit the scope for shifting components of the liquidity position to undisclosed items. Secondly, the template seeks to be sufficiently detailed to allow market participants to reach informed judgements about both reserves and drains on them. Detail is provided in several respects. These include, inter alia: a sectoral breakdown (notably as between the monetary authorities and other public sector entities); the separate identification of financial instruments that might vary in terms of liquidity (e. g., gold, deposits with banks headquartered in the reporting country) or cash flow characteristics (e. g., contingent vs. predetermined; time profiles, as captured by a residual maturity breakdown of the fixed-term liabilities); and complementary memorandum items (e. g., undrawn unconditional lines of credit, debt indexed to foreign currency). Finally, the template prescribes valuation principles that are consistent with the focus on liquidity. This suggests reporting, as far as possible, mobilisable foreign exchange resources at (approximate) market values and the future profile of drains on these resources in nominal terms (the cash flow value when the drain occurs). The group recommends endorsement of the template. At the same time, it recognises that improvements are possible. A review by technical experts of the details of the presentation would be helpful in identifying improvements in the way some of the information is portrayed and in accomplishing effective implementation. The issues to be addressed include, in particular, the treatment of derivatives positions and the clarification of the relationship between the definitions used in the report and those adopted in the balance-of-payments conventions, which are largely based on the residence criterion. It is recommended that technical experts be asked to report on these issues as soon as possible. The working group devoted much attention to the issue of timeliness, particularly in the light of the substantial element of judgement called for in examining this question. There are two features of information disclosure that affect timeliness: the disclosure lag, which determines how out-of-date the information is when released; and the frequency or periodicity of the disclosure, which determines the extent to which the information ages between releases and affects the incremental "news" content of the release. The group agreed that a common frequency and disclosure lag should apply to all the items of the template (except one memorandum item, viz. the currency composition by group of currencies). To do otherwise could greatly undermine the template's usefulness as it would provide an avenue for concealing changes in liquidity through whatever items are reported in the least timely fashion. The group also agreed that it is technically feasible to set a very high frequency and short lag. At the same time, the concomitant gains in terms of market discipline had to be weighed against the possible need for flexibility in exchange market operations, either for reserve management purposes or for covert intervention. In order to preserve flexibility in reserve management, the group decided to allow for less frequent and less detailed disclosure of the currency composition of the portfolio. Furthermore, forward positions should be reported only insofar as the domestic currency is involved, since only those transactions imply a future change in total official reserves. As concerns covert intervention, views regarding the true extent and value of such flexibility varied somewhat within the group. This reflected several factors, notably differing experiences with exchange rate regimes, institutional settings and opinions about the range and likelihood of circumstances in which it was regarded as useful to retain market uncertainty about the occurrence and/or size of the authorities' operations. Two further considerations argued against a rapid move to the highest feasible frequency and shortest feasible lag: implementation costs (especially in the context of efforts to address the "Year 2000 problem" and the introduction of the euro); and, given the residual uncertainties involved, concerns that such a step, once taken, would be costly to reverse if it proved unwarranted. In the light of these concerns, the group recommends that a first step would be to adopt a standard of a one-month frequency and a disclosure lag certainly not exceeding one month, to be implemented on or before end-June 1999. Since the frequency and disclosure lag would apply to all the categories of the template - except one memorandum item - this would already represent a significant improvement compared with current practices. In addition, the group notes that central banks are not the only holders of foreign currency reserves or liabilities, so that the full implementation of its recommendations would also require endorsement and corresponding action by other public sector entities, in particular finance ministries or treasuries. The group also considered the benefits associated with similar transparency about the risk positions, including foreign currency positions, of all private financial intermediaries. The group was of the opinion that further parallel work is needed in this area. It noted that an initial analysis had been carried out by the <b>Euro-currency</b> Standing Committee in 1994, as published in the report on "public disclosure of market and credit risks by financial intermediaries" (the "Fisher Report"). In connection with the enhanced disclosure proposed for the official sector, the group recommends that the ECSC now revisit the question of the appropriate disclosure standards for all market participants with a view to elaborating a set of good practices. ...|$|E
40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The {{purpose of}} this report is to enhance central banks’ {{understanding}} {{of the economic and}} monetary policy role of repo markets and the policy issues surrounding the development of sound and efficient repo markets. The report is divided into three chapters. The first chapter, on the economics of repo markets, explains how they are used by private market participants for such activities as hedging and leverage. The second chapter focuses on the use of repos by central banks, both as a monetary policy instrument and as a source of information on market participants’ near-term monetary policy expectations. In light of the benefits and the risks inherent in repo markets, the third chapter identifies those structural features (such as the legal framework and settlement systems) and market practices (such as adequate margining) that support sound and efficient repo markets. In repo transactions, securities are exchanged for cash with an agreement to repurchase the securities at a future date. The securities serve as collateral for what is effectively a cash loan and, conversely, the cash serves as collateral for a securities loan. There are several types of transactions with essentially equivalent economic functions - standard repurchase agreements, sell/buy-backs and securities lending - that are defined as repos {{for the purposes of the}} report. A key distinguishing feature of repos is that they can be used either to obtain funds or to obtain securities. This latter feature is valuable to market participants because it allows them to obtain the securities they need to meet other contractual obligations, such as to make delivery for a futures contract. In addition, repos can be used for leverage, to fund long positions in securities and to fund short positions for hedging interest rate risks. As repos are short-maturity collateralised instruments, repo markets have strong linkages with securities markets, derivatives markets and other short-term markets such as interbank and money markets. Repos are useful to central banks both as a monetary policy instrument and as a source of information on market expectations. Repos are attractive as a monetary policy instrument because they carry a low credit risk while serving as a flexible instrument for liquidity management. In addition, they can serve as an effective mechanism for signalling the stance of monetary policy. Repos have been widely used as a monetary policy instrument among European central banks and with the start of EMU in January 1999, the Eurosystem adopted repos as a key instrument. Repo markets can also provide central banks with information on very short-term interest rate expectations that is relatively accurate since the credit risk premium in repo rates is typically small. In this respect, they complement information on expectations over a longer horizon derived from securities with longer maturities. An assessment of the risks faced by repo market participants can help identify the conditions necessary for sound repo markets. Like other financial markets, repo markets are subject to some credit risk, operational risk and liquidity risk. However, what distinguishes the credit risk on repos from that associated with uncollateralised instruments is that repo credit exposures arise from volatility (or market risk) in the value of collateral. For example, a decline in the price of securities serving as collateral can result in an under-collateralisation of the repo. Liquidity risk arises from the possibility that a loss of liquidity in collateral markets will force liquidation of collateral at a discount in the event of a counterparty default. Leverage that is built up using repos can increase these risks. While leverage facilitates the efficient operation of financial markets, rigorous risk management by market participants using leverage is important to maintain these risks at prudent levels. Repo markets have offsetting effects on systemic risk. They are likely to be more resilient than uncollateralised markets to shocks that increase uncertainty about the credit standing of counterparties, limiting the transmission of shocks. However, this benefit could be somewhat reduced by the fact that the use of collateral in repos withdraws securities from the pool of assets that would be available to unsecured creditors in the event of a bankruptcy. Another concern is that the close linkage of repo markets to securities markets means they may help transmit shocks originating from this source. Finally, repos allow institutions to use leverage to take larger positions in financial markets, which could add to systemic risk. There are a number of structural features and market practices that support sound and efficient repo markets. Some, such as an adequate legal framework and settlement system and good margining practices, are essential to limit risks and to ensure the efficient and sound operation of markets, while others are probably less crucial. In addition to promoting these features and practices, authorities may want to conduct market surveillance of repo markets to help ensure that such practices are respected and to help detect instances of market manipulation or abuse. A number of features and market practices are especially important for sound and efficient repo markets: An adequate and efficient legal framework. There should be a clear legal definition of the repo contract (including buy/sell-back and securities lending agreements), an essential feature being unambiguous certainty as to legal rights vis-à-vis the counterparty in the event of a default. The legal framework should be complemented by well-structured legal documentation, such as master agreements. Secure and efficient settlement systems. Since the securities leg of a repo serves as collateral for the cash leg, the failure to settle simultaneously opens up a credit exposure. This risk can be contained using safe settlement procedures based on delivery-versus-payment (DVP) arrangements. Appropriate haircuts and margin call practices. While the use of collateral reduces credit risk, market participants remain exposed to credit risk arising from volatility in the value of collateral, counterparty default and liquidity risk. Haircuts and margin call practices limit these risks provided they are set at levels commensurate with risks and adjustments are implemented promptly when appropriate. Adequate transparency. To effectively manage their risk in repo markets, creditors need to have sufficient comprehensive and relevant information to assess the risks they face on an ongoing basis. However, provision of such information need not compromise proprietary information. The work on this report was initiated in December 1997 when the <b>Euro-currency</b> Standing Committee decided that interested member central banks should form a working group on repo markets based on a proposal in a pilot study by the National Bank of Belgium. The working group, under the chairmanship of the National Bank of Belgium, included the Bank of Canada, Bank of England, Bank of France, Bank of Italy, Bank of Japan, Deutsche Bundesbank, European Central Bank, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Netherlands Bank and the Bank of Sweden. In preparing its report, the working group obtained information from repo market participants using a questionnaire (in cooperation with IOSCO and the CPSS), through bilateral contacts and as a group during meetings in London and New York. ...|$|E
