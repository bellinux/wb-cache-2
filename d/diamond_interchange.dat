5|$|In early Fall 2014 VDOT {{will start}} work at Route 37's {{southern}} terminus' exit at I-81. They will extend Route 37 north {{to a new}} <b>diamond</b> <b>interchange</b> with Front Royal Pike (US 522). Then Route 37 will continue northward to Millwood Pike (US 50/ US 17) and have another <b>diamond</b> <b>interchange.</b> The next exit will be at Senseny Road (State Route 657) with another <b>diamond</b> <b>interchange.</b> The next and final exit will be a half cloverleaf interchange with VA 7, {{but it is not}} final {{that it will be a}} half cloverleaf because of Valley Mill Road (State Route 659). The problem with this is that the intersection with Valley Mill Road is where the southbound exit for Route 37 is to come into Route 7.|$|E

50|$|Finally, {{single point}} urban {{interchanges}} are reportedly safer than other space-efficient interchange forms such as (standard) <b>diamond</b> <b>interchanges.</b> Research suggests that, although {{there may not}} be {{a significant difference between the}} two types of interchanges in terms of total collisions, the injury and fatality rates are notably lower for SPUIs than <b>diamond</b> <b>interchanges.</b>|$|R
5|$|As of 2016, {{only two}} {{interchanges}} {{of the former}} SR 275 remain: a <b>diamond</b> <b>interchange</b> at Jefferson Boulevard (SR 84) and the split at Business Loop 80 / US 50.|$|E
5|$|Eastbound SR56 {{begins as}} a ramp from the {{northbound}} I-5's local bypass lanes. The interchange is not complete; southbound I-5 traffic must exit to Carmel Valley Road before entering SR56. Westbound traffic on SR56 merges into the southbound I-5 local bypass lanes, which provide access to I-805. Continuing east, the route then has a <b>diamond</b> <b>interchange</b> at Carmel Creek Road, which provides access to the nearby San Diego Jewish Academy, and proceeds eastward through a residential area. After passing milepost 2, the freeway has another <b>diamond</b> <b>interchange</b> with Carmel Country Road south {{of the community of}} Torrey Hills.|$|E
5|$|In 2010 an {{environmental}} study into building a freeway to freeway interchange in Gila Bend from SR 85 to I-8 {{was completed by}} ADOT and the Federal Highway Administration. The study found no {{significant impact on the}} local environment and outlined a finalized full freeway standard design, bypassing the I-8 Business/Maricopa Road intersection SR 85 currently traverses through. A <b>diamond</b> <b>interchange</b> Exit 121 is planned at Maricopa Road/I-8 Business along with a second <b>diamond</b> <b>interchange</b> slightly northeast of the proposed Exit 121.|$|E
50|$|The {{interchange}} is {{a complex}} of six distinct smaller interchanges, containing three Y <b>interchanges,</b> two <b>diamond</b> <b>interchanges</b> and one Parclo.|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Most signalized interchanges in Texas are tight urban <b>diamond</b> <b>interchanges</b> of freeways having one-way frontage roads. At these interchanges, traffic actuated control with improper location of detectors may result in inefficient traffic operations. Further, the signal designer usually does not have published guidelines on the optimal location of detectors at <b>diamond</b> <b>interchanges</b> based on traffic conditions. Therefore, application guidelines on the placement of detectors at <b>diamond</b> <b>interchanges</b> are needed which would result in efficient traffic operations. This research addressed the problem of determining the effective placement of inductive loop detectors on frontage roads at <b>diamond</b> <b>interchanges</b> to minimize total interchange delay. TEXAS Model for <b>diamond</b> <b>interchanges</b> was used to perform simulation studies to determine the optimal location of loop detectors on the frontage roads of <b>diamond</b> <b>interchanges.</b> "Figure 3 and Figure 4 " signal operations were the two phasing strategies considered for study. This research developed a set of detector application guidelines which were shown by TEXAS Model to provide efficient traffic operations. When a 40 -foot long stop line detector and a 6 -foot long advance detector are used on the frontage roads, it appears that a 100 -foot setback distance for the advance detector results in the lowest interchange delay for both "Figure 3 and Figure 4 " phasing sequences. The I 00 -foot setback distance produces less delay than detector layouts having longer advance detector setback distances. In addition, total interchange delay appears to be very sensitive to increase in U-turn volume for the "Figure 4 " phasing sequence...|$|R

5|$|In 2012, a {{diverging}} <b>diamond</b> <b>interchange</b> {{was added}} {{at the intersection}} of I-590 and Winton Road in the Brighton suburb of Rochester.|$|E
5|$|MD32's {{interchange}} with I-70 will {{be transformed}} from a <b>diamond</b> <b>interchange</b> to a partial cloverleaf interchange with free-flowing ramps from MD32 to I-70.|$|E
5|$|The nearby Hurontario Street {{interchange}} was upgraded from a cloverleaf to a parclo A4 on {{the south}} side and a <b>diamond</b> <b>interchange</b> on the north side. Work was completed in 2010.|$|E
50|$|Many of the 100-series {{highways}} in Nova Scotia and arterial highways in New Brunswick are two-lane freeways, with <b>diamond</b> <b>interchanges</b> {{and grade}} separations with many intersecting roads.|$|R
50|$|Full <b>diamond</b> <b>interchanges</b> are large, {{multi-level}} interchanges {{that use}} flyover/under ramps to handle both {{right and left}} turns. One example is the junction of Interstate 40 and I-44 in Oklahoma City.|$|R
50|$|Interstate 90 Business is a {{business}} loop of Interstate 90 in Sundance. It runs from <b>diamond</b> <b>interchanges</b> at exit 185 and at exit 195. The route also carries US 14 and includes West Street and East Cleveland Street.|$|R
5|$|As {{part of the}} project, Tonkin Highway was {{expanded}} from two to three lanes in both directions, between Great Eastern Highway and Roe Highway, with the existing intersections in this section becoming grade separated. A new <b>diamond</b> <b>interchange</b> was constructed with Dunreath Drive {{to provide access to}} the domestic terminal precinct, replacing Brearley Avenue as the main access to the precinct. International terminal access was provided via a new freeway-to-freeway cloverstack interchange at Leach Highway, and a single-point urban interchange at the intersection with Horrie Miller Drive and Kewdale Road. The existing <b>diamond</b> <b>interchange</b> with Roe Highway was upgraded to a partial freeway-to-freeway interchange, but with plans to further upgrade it to a completely free-flowing interchange in the future.|$|E
5|$|Exit6 on the Adirondack Northway was {{originally}} a <b>diamond</b> <b>interchange.</b> Construction {{to convert the}} junction into a single-point urban interchange began in mid-2008 and was completed on September 12, 2010. The {{total cost of the}} project was $41.9million.|$|E
5|$|The turnpike's first exit in {{the city}} is Exit 414, a <b>diamond</b> <b>interchange</b> with 78th Street. Next, the highway curves {{slightly}} to the northeast and intersects the Turner Diagonal at Exit 415, an interchange consisting of a half-cloverleaf for the western ramps and a Y-connection for the eastern ramps that intersects the Turner Diagonal at a trumpet interchange north of the turnpike. East of here, the route has a <b>diamond</b> <b>interchange</b> with 57th Street at Exit 417. Directly east of 57th Street, the turnpike crosses Brenner Heights Creek. After this, the turnpike continues due east to a fully directional interchange with I-635 at Exit 418.|$|E
50|$|The freeway portion {{starts as}} the loop curves towards the {{northeast}} {{at the junction}} with SH 151. Loop 1604 has <b>diamond</b> <b>interchanges</b> at FM 471 (Culebra Road), Shaenfield Road, New Guilbeau Road, Braun Road, and SH 16 (Bandera Road).|$|R
50|$|Interstate 90 Business was a 0.5 mi {{business}} spur of Interstate 90 in White Lake. It {{ran from}} a <b>diamond</b> <b>interchanges</b> at exit 296 north along 374th Street (South Main Street) until the intersection with Aurora CR 34 (Old Highway 16).|$|R

5|$|In 2018, WSDOT {{plans to}} begin {{construction}} of a replacement interchange at I-5 and SR 510. A diverging <b>diamond</b> <b>interchange</b> {{was selected as the}} preferred design, and could become the first to be constructed in Washington; the $72 million project will be funded by the 2015 Connecting Washington package and is scheduled to be completed in 2020.|$|E
5|$|MD295 {{is planned}} to be widened to six lanes between MD100 and I-195 with a new {{interchange}} is {{planned to be}} constructed at Hanover Road. The type of interchange {{has not yet been}} decided upon with choices including a <b>diamond</b> <b>interchange,</b> a single-point urban interchange, and a modified cloverleaf interchange. Planning for the $24million project concluded in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 2007, BL-80 was {{the only}} {{connection}} {{to the city of}} Wendover from Utah. However, a new partial <b>diamond</b> <b>interchange,</b> which allows traffic from I-80 to exit going westbound and for traffic to enter I-80 eastbound, at Aria Boulevard was constructed. The Aria Boulevard interchange was first planned in 2005, and was completed without using any federal funding.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diamond</b> <b>interchanges</b> {{are much}} more {{economical}} in use of materials and land than other interchange designs, as the junction does not normally require more than one bridge to be constructed. However, their capacity is lower than other interchanges and when traffic volumes are high they can easily become congested.|$|R
50|$|The Federal and State {{governments are}} trying to improve their {{national}} highway systems by repaving highways, widening highways, replacing bridges, and reconstructing some interchanges. Many cloverleaf interchanges are being converted to parclo <b>interchanges.</b> Busy <b>Diamond</b> <b>interchanges</b> are also being converted to SPUIs (single-point-urban interchange) or to parclos to reduce interchange congestion.|$|R
50|$|At Greeley, SH 257 has two {{interchanges}} with US 34 and US 34 Business. Because {{the intersection}} {{is so close}} to the terminus of Business Route 34, the two interchanges are just 0.3 miles apart. Both are <b>diamond</b> <b>interchanges,</b> but at US 34 there are only entrance ramps from the east side.|$|R
5|$|The turnpike {{continues}} east along I-70 {{and crosses}} Tecumseh Creek. The Topeka Service Area {{is located on}} the north side of the road east of here at mile 188. It is accessed by ramps on the right side of the highway in both directions. Just east of the service area, the turnpike enters Douglas County while passing over US-40 without an interchange. The route then curves to the southeast and runs roughly parallel to US-40. A series of curves takes the turnpike farther east as it reaches Exit 197 (Lecompton), a folded <b>diamond</b> <b>interchange</b> with the western terminus of K-10. After this, the highway continues farther east and enters the city of Lawrence, where it shares a <b>diamond</b> <b>interchange</b> with McDonald Drive at Exit 202 (West Lawrence). McDonald Drive leads to US-59 south of the turnpike. East of here, the highway bends east-northeasterly, crosses the Kansas River, and then intersects US-40 and US-59, which run concurrently, at Exit 204 (East Lawrence).|$|E
5|$|Future {{projects}} {{will result in}} numerous changes. A full interchange will be constructed between Wellington County Road34 and Maltby Road; the intersection with the former will become an overpass while the latter will be closed, with Maltby Road terminating at a cul-de-sac {{on both sides of}} the expressway. Further north, a partial-access <b>diamond</b> <b>interchange</b> will be built at Downey Road/ Kortright Road West, with ramps from the northbound lanes and to the southbound lanes and the crossroad run beneath the expressway.|$|E
5|$|In October 2012 {{the state}} {{government}} announced that the freeway's <b>diamond</b> <b>interchange</b> with Reid Highway will be upgraded with the installation of extra turning lanes and traffic lights. The project is an interim solution to lower congestion and reduce the volume of traffic using local roads to avoid the interchange. The longer term plan is to upgrade Reid Highway to a dual carriageway near the freeway interchange, including a second overpass bridge. The dual carriageway works are scheduled for construction in 2014–15.|$|E
50|$|In 2011, the highway's traffic-light intersections at Alexander Drive and Mirrabooka Avenue {{were both}} {{upgraded}} to <b>diamond</b> <b>interchanges,</b> with bridges being constructed to carry highway traffic. Along with the similarly grade-separated Wanneroo Road interchange, this completed an 8 kilometre section of grade-separated, free traffic flow between the industrial estates of Balcatta and Malaga.|$|R
50|$|Interstate 15 Business is a Business loop of Interstate 15 in Conrad. It {{runs along}} Old Highway 91 from <b>diamond</b> <b>interchanges</b> at Exit 335 and Exit 339.
