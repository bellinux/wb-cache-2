Psoriasis in the scalp, palms and soles, and <b>intertriginous</b> <b>areas</b> differ from disease on other body parts, and treatment regimens must be tailored to these areas. The presence of hair, along with the frequent, thick scale of psoriasis makes the scalp a challenge to treat. Skin in the body’s <b>intertriginous</b> <b>areas</b> is often thin, limiting treatment options for inverse psoriasis.

40|$|Introduction. Psoriasis and {{lichen planus}} are common {{dermatological}} conditions, whose coexistence is rarely described. Although the exact etiopathogenesis of both diseases is still unknown, autoimmune factors {{play an important}} role in their development.

To present a patient with oral lichen planus, in whom psoriasis developed. Case report. A 75 -year-old patient, with a 3 -year history of oral lichen planus, presented itchy erythematous skin lesions initially located in the <b>intertriginous</b> <b>area.</b> Outpatient treatment consisting of topical and oral antifungal medications did not bring significant improvement.

50|$|General skin atrophy {{consists}} of a reduction in epidermal and dermal thickness, regression of the sebaceous glands, subcutaneous fat loss, and muscle-layer atrophy. These changes are typically observed following 2 to 3 weeks of moderate- to high-potency topical corticosteroid use. A single application of a very potent topical steroid can cause an ultrasonographically detectable decrease in skin thickness that lasts up to 3 days. Even low-potency topical steroids can cause slight skin atrophy that often reverses upon discontinuation of the drugs. Atrophy and striae are of concern on areas of the skin with high permeability, such as the face and <b>intertriginous</b> <b>areas,</b> but these adverse events can occur anywhere, especially after long-term use of moderate- or high-potency topical corticosteroids. While mild atrophy and telangiectasia might be reversible upon discontinuation of corticosteroids, overtly visible changes in skin texture and striae are considered permanent manifestations of corticosteroid-induced atrophy and are resistant to treatment.|$|R
