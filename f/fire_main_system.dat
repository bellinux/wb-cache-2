40|$|Installation of the AGS in USS THORN can be {{accomplished}} while retaining most of the baseline capabilities of the platform. The outcome of the analysis of alternatives indicated that placement of AGS mount aft, in place of Mount 52 and the NATO Sea Sparrow Missile system, as the preferred alternative. Among the reasons for its selection was the 304 round capacity of its magazine, the retention of more major war-fighting capabilities, and the minimization of cost and baseline ship impact. This configuration results in degradation of the AAW self-defense capability of the modified USS THORN, due {{to the loss of}} the NSSMS. However, with the full preservation of the baseline strike and anti-submarine capabilities, the ship remains a viable war-fighting platform. The modified USS THORN exhibits structural characteristics largely unaffected by the installation of AGS. Electrical and auxiliary systems are seen to be capable of accommodating the gun system, although slight doctrine changes such as placing additional pumps online or splitting the electrical bus may be necessary. The electrical system will experience an increase of 719 kW under battle conditions, best configured by splitting the bus to prevent the electrical draw of the gun from tripping other systems offline. The <b>fire</b> <b>main</b> <b>system</b> experiences an increased demand of 2438 gpm, mostly due to a very high flow magazine sprinkling system, with the installation of the AGS.

5000|$|The <b>fire</b> {{protection}} <b>system's</b> <b>main</b> {{goal should}} be to detect and alert of fire in the early stages, then bring fire under control without disrupting the flow of business and without threatening the personnel in the facility.Server room fire suppression technology has been around for as long as there have been server rooms. Traditionally, most computer rooms used Halon gas, but this {{has been shown to be}} environmentally unfriendly (ozone depleting) and unsafe for humans. Modern computer rooms use combinations of inert gases such as Nitrogen, Argon and CO2. Other solutions include clean chemical agents such as FM200 and also hypoxic air solutions that keep oxygen levels down. To prevent fires from spreading due to data cable and cord heat generation, organizations have also used those that are coated with FEP tubing. This plastic reduces heat generation and safeguards material metal efficiently.|$|R

40|$|A tuned {{mass damper}} (TMD) is a device {{consisting}} of small damped spring-mass system attached to a vibrating <b>main</b> <b>system</b> in order to attenuate any undesirable vibrations. In this paper, optimum parameters of TMD system attached to a viscously damped single degree-of-freedom <b>main</b> <b>system</b> are derived for various combinations of excitation and response parameters. The excitation applied to the <b>main</b> <b>system</b> consists of external force and base acceleration modelled as Gaussian white-noise random process. Using numerical searching technique, the optimum damping and tuning frequency ratio of the TMD are obtained for minimization of various mean square responses such as relative displacement, velocity of main mass and force transmitted to the support. The optimum parameters of the TMD system and the corresponding response quantities are obtained for different damping ratios of the <b>main</b> <b>system</b> and the mass ratios of the TMD system. Explicit formulae for damper damping, tuning frequency and the corresponding minimized response are then derived using curve-fitting technique that can be conveniently used for applications in dynamical systems. The error in these expressions {{is found to be}} negligible and hence these expressions are convenient for use in damped single degree-of-freedom <b>main</b> <b>system.</b> The optimum damping ratio of the TMD is not much influenced by the damping of the <b>main</b> <b>system.</b> However, the optimum tuning frequency of TMD is significantly affected by the damping of <b>main</b> <b>system.</b> Lastly, a comparison of the optimum damping and tuning frequency of the TMD under filtered white-noise and white-noise excitation is also made.
