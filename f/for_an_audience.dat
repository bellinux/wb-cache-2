5|$|Stage {{magic is}} {{performed}} <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> {{in a variety}} of media and locations: on stage, on television, in the street, and live at parties or events. It is often combined with other forms of entertainment, such as comedy or music and showmanship is often an essential part of magic performances. Performance magic relies on deception, psychological manipulation, sleight of hand and other forms of trickery to give an audience the illusion that a performer can achieve the impossible. Audiences amazed at the stunt performances and escape acts of Harry Houdini, for example, regarded him as a magician.|$|E
5|$|The tenth {{play and}} new {{companion}} piece to The Tragedy of Tragedies, The Welsh Opera, ran many times {{until it was}} expanded into The Grub-Street Opera. The expanded version of the play, The Grub-Street Opera, was not put on <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>audience,</b> which provoked E. Rayner to print The Welsh Opera without Fielding's consent. The play serves both {{as a tribute to}} the Scriblerians, especially Gay and Gay's The Beggar's Opera, and to put forth a political allegory that satirises Walpole's government and the British monarchy. In particular, it mocked the feud between Walpole and Pulteney, a Privy Councillor.|$|E

5|$|Four years later, Kapoor {{returned}} to the stage with six other Bollywood celebrities in the successful Rockstars Concert world tour. The concert was originally scheduled to commence in April 2006, but was postponed due {{to the arrest of}} Salman Khan. It later began the following month and was staged in 19 cities across the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada. In 2008, Kapoor performed in Shah Rukh Khan's Temptation Reloaded 2008, a series of concerts in a number of countries. The show (which also featured Arjun Rampal, Katrina Kaif, Ganesh Hegde, Javed Ali and Anusha Dandekar) debuted at the Ahoy Rotterdam venue in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Several months later she again joined Khan, Rampal and Kaif to perform <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> of 15,000 at Dubai's Festival City Arena.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Demi Moore was {{a budding}} A-list film star {{who had been}} married to Bruce Willis since 1987. The couple had had their first child Rumer Willis in 1988, and they had hired three photographers <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> of six friends for the delivery. In 1990, she had starred in that year's highest-grossing film, Ghost, for which she was paid $750,000, and she had earned $2.5 million for 1991 roles in The Butcher's Wife and Mortal Thoughts. Following the photo, she would earn $3 million for her 1992 role in A Few Good Men and $5 million apiece for roles in Indecent Proposal (1993), Disclosure (1994) and The Scarlet Letter (1995).|$|E
5|$|Into Temptation was optioned in Hollywood, but Coyle was displeased when {{industry}} officials {{wanted him to}} change the ending and make the sex scenes more risque. Due to complications from the financial crisis of 2007–2010, the Hollywood discussions eventually collapsed. It did not receive a national release, but played at theaters in New York City, Los Angeles, Fargo, North Dakota, and several cities throughout Minnesota, including Minneapolis and Duluth. Coyle first publicly showed the film on December 26, 2008, at the Omaha hospice where his father Jim was staying <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> of about 15 people. Jim Coyle, who died {{a few weeks after}} the screening, loved the film, describing it as very powerful and truthful. It officially premiered on April 26, 2009, at the Newport Beach Film Festival in Newport Beach, California.|$|E

5|$|Once Adrienne was {{released}} from prison in France, she, with the help of U.S. Minister to France James Monroe, obtained passports for her and her daughters from Connecticut, which had granted the entire Lafayette family citizenship. Her son Georges Washington had been smuggled out of France and taken to the United States. Adrienne and her two daughters journeyed to Vienna <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> with Emperor Francis, who granted permission for the three women to live with Lafayette in captivity. Lafayette, who had endured harsh solitary confinement since his escape attempt a year before, was astounded when soldiers opened his prison door to usher in his wife and daughters on 15 October 1795. The family spent the next two years in confinement together.|$|E
5|$|The {{stage and}} the spaces set {{out in front of}} it <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> create a theatre. All types of stage are used with all types of seating for the audience, {{including}} the impromptu or improvised (2, 3, 6); the temporary (2); the elaborate (9); or the traditional and permanent (5, 7). They are erected indoors (3, 5, 9) or outdoors (2, 4, 6). The skill of managing, organising and preparing the stage for a performance is known as stagecraft (10). The audience's experience of the entertainment is affected by their expectations, the stagecraft, the type of stage, and the type and standard of seating provided.|$|E
5|$|Although written {{during the}} Twelfth dynasty, Ipuwer only survives from a Nineteenth dynasty papyrus. However, A {{man and his}} Ba is found on an {{original}} Twelfth dynasty papyrus, Papyrus Berlin 3024. These two texts resemble other discourses in style, tone, and subject matter, although they are unique in that the fictional audiences are given very active roles in the exchange of dialogue. In Ipuwer, a sage addresses an unnamed king and his attendants, describing the miserable state of the land, which he blames on the king's inability to uphold royal virtues. This can be seen either {{as a warning to}} kings or as a legitimization of the current dynasty, contrasting it with the supposedly turbulent period that preceded it. In A man and his Ba, a man recounts <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> a conversation with his ba (a component of the Egyptian soul) on whether to continue living in despair or to seek death as an escape from misery.|$|E

5|$|On December 11, 2013, {{a second}} European leg through 2014 was {{announced}} {{bringing the total}} number of shows to 132, thus becoming Beyoncé's longest running tour to date. Similar to the first European leg, a frenzied rush for tickets, further enhanced by the release of the singer's self-titled fifth studio album three days before ticket sales began, resulted in extra dates being added for all United Kingdom shows, Dublin, Cologne, Amsterdam and Antwerp. For the second European leg, Beyoncé had beaten the record she herself had set earlier in the year, by selling 40,000 tickets in under one hour for the two 2014 concerts at Antwerp. Pollstar ranked The Mrs. Carter Show at number 2 on its year-end chart of the top twenty grossing worldwide tours with a gross of $188.6 million from the 2013 shows. Tickets were sold with an average gross of $2,449,248 per city. In April 2014, Billboard reported that Beyoncé's 2014 European shows grossed $41.1 million and played <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> of 384,730. This brought The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour's total gross to $229.7 million when combined with the 107 shows performed in 2013, and the total attendance to 2,082,848, averaging 15,779 attendance and $1.74 million gross per night. The tour is Beyoncé's highest grossing to date before being surpassed by The Formation World Tour which grossed over $256 million, and one of the highest grossing tours of the decade.|$|E
5|$|On February 6, 2007, {{the day of}} the album's release, Fall Out Boy played three free shows, each in a {{different}} city in the United States. The day started with a morning performance in Times Square in New York City, followed by a gig in the band's hometown of Chicago, and then a late-night show in Los Angeles. In March 2008, Fall Out Boy attempted to enter The Guinness Book of World Records for being the only band to perform in all seven continents in nine months, planning to perform in Antarctica <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> of scientists while working with Greenpeace to raise awareness about global warming. However, the group was unable to make the flight from Punta Arenas, Chile to Antarctica due to poor weather. Instead, Wentz and Stump went on to break the world record for the most interviews conducted by a duo in a 24-hour period, setting the mark at seventy-four.|$|E
5|$|On March 15, 2007, the Japanese {{television}} station BS-i announced a Clannad anime series via a short 30-second teaser trailer that was featured {{at the end}} of the final episode of the second Kanon anime series. Clannad is produced by Kyoto Animation and directed by Tatsuya Ishihara, who also worked on other adaptations of Key's visual novels Air, and Kanon. The anime aired between October 4, 2007 and March 27, 2008, containing 23 aired episodes out of a planned 24; the broadcast time was first announced on August 11, 2007 at the TBS festival Anime Festa, which is also when the first episode was showcased. The anime series was released in a set of eight DVD compilations released between December 19, 2007 and July 16, 2008 by Pony Canyon, with each compilation containing three episodes. Of the 24 episodes, 23 were aired on television with the first 22 being regular episodes, followed by an additional extra episode. The last episode was released as an original video animation (OVA) on the eighth DVD on July 16, 2008 and is set in an alternate universe from the anime series where Tomoya and Tomoyo are dating, which is based on Tomoyo's scenario in the game. The OVA episode was previewed on May 31, 2008 <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> of four-hundred people picked via a mail-in postcard campaign. A Blu-ray Disc (BD) box set of Clannad was released on April 30, 2010.|$|E

25|$|The theatre was a hub of {{activity}} in Sakata during the early 1970s and welcomed many patrons; {{at the time it}} was one of five active cinemas in the city. It would often screen films while their Tokyo runs were still ongoing, which was a source of pride to the Sakata populace. In 1976 the harbour area around Minato-za burned to the ground, consuming Green House and two other competing cinemas. Minato-za, however, survived. The cinema soon had three screens of varying sizes: one <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> of 180, one <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> of 80, and one <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>audience</b> of 30 people. Over the following decades a diversification in available entertainment venues, such as television and multiplex theatres with large parking lots, led to a decline in patronage. In 2002 the Sakata Minato-za, the last cinema in the city, was closed.|$|E
