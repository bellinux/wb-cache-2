40|$|The {{current study}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate the effects of zinc supplementation on endocrine outcomes, biomarkers of inflammation, and oxidative stress in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This study was a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Forty-eight women (18 â�� 40 Â years) with PCOS diagnosed according to Rotterdam criteria were randomly assigned to receive either 220 Â mg zinc sulfate (containing 50 Â mg zinc) (group 1; nÂ =Â 24) and/or placebo (group 2; nÂ =Â 24) for 8 Â weeks. <b>Hormonal</b> <b>profiles,</b> biomarkers of inflammation, and oxidative stress were measured at study baseline and after 8 -week intervention. After 8 Â weeks of intervention, alopecia (41. 7 vs. 12. 5 Â, PÂ =Â 0. 02) decreased compared with the placebo. Additionally, patients who received zinc supplements had significantly decreased hirsutism (modified Ferriman-Gallwey scores) (â�� 1. 71 Â Â±Â 0. 99 vs. â�� 0. 29 Â Â±Â 0. 95, PÂ <Â 0. 001) and plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) levels (â�� 0. 09 Â Â±Â 1. 31 vs. + 2. 34 Â Â±Â 5. 53 Â Î¼mol/L, PÂ =Â 0. 04) compared with the placebo.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{study the}} effects of green tea on body weight, and {{biochemical}} and <b>hormonal</b> <b>profiles</b> in obese Chinese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). METHODS: Thirty-four obese Chinese women with PCOS were randomized into either treatment with green tea capsules or placebo for 3 months. The anthropometric measurements, and biochemical and <b>hormonal</b> <b>profiles</b> before and after treatment in each group were compared. RESULTS: The body weight of the green tea group decreased by a nonsignificant 2. 4 % after treatment; whereas the body weight, body mass index (BMI), and body fat content of the control group were significantly higher after 3 months. There were no differences in any of the hormone levels measured in either group. The biochemical profiles of the two groups were also similar except that there was a small but significant rise in the triglyceride level in the green tea group. Fewer patients in the green tea group remained amenorrhoeic, but this was not significantly different from the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Green tea supplementation did not significantly reduce body weight in obese women with PCOS, nor did it alter the glucose or lipid metabolism.

40|$|This {{model has}} been {{developed}} within a multi-disciplinary project bringing together physiologists, veterinarians, modellers, and breeding industry experts with the aim to develop a realistic representation of bovine reproductive physiology able to accommodate the effects of known nutritional factors on reproduction. Three related modules have been developed: The first represents the axis of reproductive biology structures namely the hypoythalamus, pituitary gland, ovary (follicle, oocyte and corpus luteum), and uterus together with the associated dynamic patterns of the major hormonal signals (GnRH, FSH, LH, oestrogen, progesterone, prostaglandins, and interferon tau). This model successfully recreates <b>hormonal</b> <b>profiles</b> through the different reproductive stages (postpartum anoestrus, oestrus cycling, and pregnancy). An example of an LH profile simulated by the model through 2 successive oestrus cycles is presented in Figure 1, relative to an observed profile. This module also simulates follicule waves with selection and ovulation (or not) of the dominant follicle. It also models the cross talk between the corpus luteum and uterus with respect to length of the luteal phase and embryonic loss (early or late) or maintenance of pregnancy. In the second module, oestrus expression behaviour is simulated. This {{is based on the}} <b>hormonal</b> <b>profiles</b> from the first module (mainly oestrogen) and incorporating other factors such as number of herd mates in oestrus. The third module represents reproductive management. In this module a wide range of reproductive management strategies can be represented in terms of their temporal structure both within day as time windows of oestrus observation and across lactation or calendar time as time windows of different reproductive actions. This module is designed to allow the impact of different reproductive management strategies on herd reproductive performance to be tested. At present, the reproductive physiology {{model has been}} shown to provide a realistic representation of <b>hormonal</b> <b>profiles,</b> follicle and corpus luteum dynamics, and hence normal reproductive performance measures. The next phase of this work (which will be carried out in a European Union funded project) will use the model to develop improved reproductive management tools that are urgently needed by the cattle industry...|$|R

Case ReportA 32 -year-old, unmarried woman without sexual experience had undergone a total hysterectomy and accidental bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for huge uterine fibroids and dense pelvic adhesion. A fresh autologous right normal hemi-ovary was transplanted into the adipose tissue {{on the right side}} of the Pfannenstiel incision site. During the 51 -month follow-up after transplantation, a series of <b>hormonal</b> <b>profiles</b> for serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol (E 2) and progesterone were carried out, together with ultrasound detection of the presence of subcutaneous follicles and an analysis of menopausal symptoms. Postoperative hormone levels at months 14, 18, 22, 30 and 51 were as follows: (1) FSH, 17. 06, 11. 33, 51. 44, 28. 6 and 61. 41 mIU/mL, respectively; (2) LH, 15. 1, 6. 7, 20. 1, 15. 7 and 28. 9 mIU/mL, respectively; (3) E 2, 79. 7, 128, 55. 9, 18. 6 and < 10 pg/mL, respectively; and (4) progesterone, 4. 52, 9. 51, 0. 67, 0. 45 and 0. 25 ng/mL, respectively.
