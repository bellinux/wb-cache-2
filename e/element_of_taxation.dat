The thesis aims to give a comprehensive overview of the issues concluding treaties for the avoidance <b>of</b> double <b>taxation</b> and show what influence they can have on individual provisions of the cross-border effects of economic entities. I start from the hypothesis that the actual provisions of individual contracts can affect decision-making bodies, whether in the country to do business or not. In conclusion, this hypothesis is confirmed. The first chapter of this thesis deals with the taxation generally. Formulates double taxation in general, the various essential <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> as subject to tax, the tax rate. It also deals with the sources of the Czech tax law, the emergence <b>of</b> double <b>taxation</b> and the method of its solution.

The aim of our account is to show how class and gender inequalities intersect to exclude the non-employed and low-paid workers (in both of which categories women are over-represented) from many of the benefits of fiscal welfare. Our objectives are threefold: firstly, to show how women as low-paid workers are largely excluded from the system of fiscal welfare; secondly, to show how the low-paid regardless of gender are excluded from the major benefits provided in the tax system; and thirdly, to show how assumptions about the domestic division of labour in the family and about intra-family income transfers are embedded in the taxation and social security policies which have been developed to take account of family dependencies...|$|R

This definition is very broad and group taxation could be better understood when considering the more common forms <b>of</b> group <b>taxation</b> such as the group relief regime and the consolidation regime. The consolidation regime generally involves each company with{{in a group of}} companies computing its own income after which the income is consolidated at the holding company-level for tax purposes.

40|$|The {{paper is}} devoted {{to the study of the}} current state <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> system in the period of its reform and to further designs in the field of {{fundamental}} bases <b>of</b> <b>taxation.</b> The purpose <b>of</b> writing this article is an in–depth study of the nature, the essence of risks in the sphere <b>of</b> <b>taxation,</b> consideration <b>of</b> the content of the system of the risk management and substantiation of conceptual bases of the efficiency <b>of</b> the <b>taxation</b> risk management by introducing a systematic approach under conditions of a large share of the shadow economy. The study was conducted with the use of the methods of deduction and induction, system approach, analysis and synthesis on the basis of the legislative framework of Ukraine, data by the state fiscal service of Ukraine, data by the state statistics service of Ukraine, papers by domestic and foreign economists, materials of the authors’ research. The nature and position <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> risks in the system of their management were studied. It is proven that the taxation, as well as economic, risks are usually too overestimated, because as far as the cost is concerned, the measures to improve the performance results of human capital are very vague and formed under imperfect information conditions. The need for a systematic approach to managing taxation risks was identified. The main <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> the management system <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> risks were considered. The influence of human capital and information on the efficiency <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> risks management was proven. Special attention is paid to the feasibility study <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> risks in the system of their management and to minimization of countermeasures. It is proven that such a system can be described as a set of certain methods, procedures and measures that makes it possible to forecast the deficit of tax payments and to take measures in regard to minimizing abuses in the taxation field. The main <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> the <b>taxation</b> risks management system were considered. This system is a set of interconnected and interrelated elements such as: 1) the essence and the original sources of risk; 2) analysis, evaluation and description of the risk; 3) methods of minimizing risks; 4) monitoring of measures of prevention and counteraction of risk. It is proven that the method of systematization of the taxpayers is applied according to the standards for determining the taxation risks in the system of their management. This approach will allow implementing into practice a new strategy of organization of the control and revision work with significant reduction in the cost of implementation of planned inspections. It is stressed that the taxation risks should be considered as a scientific basis for the design of the criterion of the efficiency of creating systems <b>of</b> national <b>taxation</b> security. Like any risk, taxation risks must not be identified only, but kept to a minimum. To do this, it is advisable to apply a taxation risks management system as a set of certain methods, procedures and activities. The use of human capital and information software will provide for reaching the necessary level of efficiency. The application of a systematic approach in the theory and practice <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> will help to anticipate the negative consequences of the impact of the external environment; will contribute to the efficient monitoring of the risks and their practical management. The fiscal service may increase the amount of tax revenue to the budget by reducing tax abuses (tax evasion). This, in turn, will promote the exit of the economy out of the shadow. Scientific novelty of the research is in the deepening and determining the nature and the essence <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> risks, as well as the substantiation of conceptual bases of the efficiency of their management through the implementation of a systematic approach. Adopting a systemic approach will allow fiscal services to efficiently manage taxation risks. A promising area of research is to review regulating documentation of the state fiscal service on the basis of a systematic approach and consideration <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> risk as a measurement of results of human capital performance and imperfect information provision...|$|R

The main aim {{of this article is to}} examine the impact of personal income tax reliefs on Lithuanian public finances. To achieve this aim, statistical information was systemized; Monte Carlo method was used to group data by horizontal rows and logical links analysed, which helped to evaluate the influence of tax reliefs on public finances.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{describe}} {{the current state of}} tax system in the Netherlands. This system is interesting because it combines <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> high progressive <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> income of individuals with large tax savings for a holding company based in the Netherlands. The paper describes the design of income tax of individuals and legal persons in the Netherlands and compares them with the Czech legislation. Description of these two taxes is held according to design of tax in this order: subject of tax, object of tax, expenditures, tax base, deductions from the tax base, tax rate, tax credits, tax collection and administration. Further, there are also described other taxes of tax mix of the Netherlands. The Dutch tax system in comparison with the Czech is characteristic of higher clarity. This is due to the reduced number of exclusions and exemptions from the subject of taxes and greater harmonization of tax rates in individual Boxes. This creates a basis for effective administration and tax collection, thereby reducing opportunities not only for tax evasion, but tax avoidance...|$|R

That is why I found it very interesting to make a deeper insight into this topic and deal with one partial issue <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> personal income providing the taxpayers with an important opportunity to lower their calculated tax obligation. This opportunity is represented by the above- mentioned tax discounts.
