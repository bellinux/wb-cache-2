50|$|The party {{raising a}} dispute of fact in motion proceedings, the court found, must seriously and {{unambiguously}} address that fact. This will {{indicate that the}} dispute is real, genuine or bona fide. If the <b>disputing</b> <b>party</b> necessarily possesses the knowledge and ability to show the facts in question to be untrue or inaccurate, but nonetheless fails to do so, instead resting on a bare or ambiguous denial, there is no bona fide dispute of fact.|$|E
5000|$|A real, {{genuine and}} bona fide dispute of fact can exist only where {{the court is}} {{satisfied}} that the party who purports to raise the dispute has in his affidavit seriously and unambiguously addressed the fact said to be disputed. There will of course be instances where a bare denial meets the requirement {{because there is no}} other way open to the <b>disputing</b> <b>party</b> and nothing more can therefore be expected of him. But even that may not be sufficient if the fact averred lies purely within the knowledge of the averring party and no basis is laid for disputing the veracity or accuracy of the averment. When the facts averred are such that the <b>disputing</b> <b>party</b> must necessarily possess knowledge of them and be able to provide an answer (or countervailing evidence) if they be not true or accurate but, instead of doing so, rests his case on a bare or ambiguous denial the court will generally have difficulty in finding that the test is satisfied. I say I [...] "generally" [...] because factual averments seldom stand apart from a broader matrix of circumstances all of which needs to be borne in mind when arriving at a decision. A litigant may not necessarily recognise or understand the nuances of a bare or general denial as against a real attempt to grapple with all relevant factual allegations made by the other party. But when he signs the answering affidavit, he commits himself to its contents, inadequate as they may be, and will only in exceptional circumstances be permitted to disavow them.|$|E

In response, critics make the point that any judge, whether domestic or international, who is part of a legal system not shown to be systematically biased or unreliable, has a greater claim to independence than an arbitrator because they are insulated from conflicts of interest that arise when arbitrators work on the side as lawyers, and is assigned cases in an objective manner rather than by the discretion of a <b>disputing</b> <b>party</b> or an executive official.

40|$|Previous {{research}} on mediation has not examined {{the influence that}} disputant affect state may have on perceptions of mediators and proposals for resolving the conflict. This influence may be particularly important in situations where a mediator has similar interests, or is aligned, with one particular <b>disputing</b> <b>party.</b> The present study attempted to examine how affect states influence the evaluations of mediators with unfavorable and favorable alignment. Hypotheses were that, compared to neutrals, negative and positive affect states would lead to increased reliance on heuristics such as mediator alignment for determining perceptions of the mediation situation. One hundred twenty-one participants wrote essays designed to induce angry, neutral, or happy affect states, and then participated in a mediation task. Results indicated no support for the hypotheses.

40|$|The North American Free Trade Agreement (2 ̆ 2 NAFTA 2 ̆ 2) {{entered into}} force in January 1994. For Mexico, {{this was an}} {{important}} step. Before NAFTA, all foreign investor disputes were resolved in domestic administrative tribunals and judicial courts because Mexico did not recognize international claims by foreign investors. Since NAFTA, however, Mexico has changed its policy and now allows investors of the other NAFTA Party to submit a claim against it before an international tribunal for breach of its obligations under NAFTA Chapter 11. NAFTA Chapter Eleven is divided in two sections: Section A contains the substantive rules such as National Treatment, Minimum Standards of Treatment, Performance Requirements, Transfers and Expropriation, and Compensation. Section B contains the dispute settlement rules for investor-State arbitrations. The <b>disputing</b> <b>party</b> is able to choose among three different arbitration rules: the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (2 ̆ 2 ICSID Convention 2 ̆ 2), the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (2 ̆ 2 ICSID 2 ̆ 2) Additional Facility Arbitration Rules, or the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (2 ̆ 2 UNCITRAL 2 ̆ 2) arbitration rules. NAFTA Chapter 11 {{is similar to the}} Bilateral Investment Treaties (2 ̆ 2 BITs 2 ̆ 2) signed by the United States. The investor-State mechanism has been used by investors to claim damages for alleged breach of their investments. This mechanism allows the investor of one Party to bring a claim against another Party for alleged breaches of Section A of NAFTA Chapter 11. Given the importance of this chapter for both investments and investors in the North American region, I will proceed to make a general overview of some issues regarding Minimum Standards of Treatment and Expropriation principles. I will also comment on the recent decision in the Metalclad case and on the acceptance of amicus curiae briefs in investor-State arbitrations...|$|E

Isprave pokazuju da se težilo prijateljskom razrješavanju sukoba preko arbitara ili medijatora, koji su umjesto stranaka u sporu morali pregovarati za konačno rješenje. Ipak, prava uloga i mjesto arbitraže problematična je zbog nejasnoća u izvorima te je njihove ovlasti teško razlikovati od onih sudaca. Sve su te dužnosti imale jedinstveni cilj, nagodbu među sukobljenim stranama, a postizanje pomirbe smatralo se vrjednijim ciljem i od potrage za istinom u sudskim i izvansudskim postupcima. The {{judicial}} {{settlement of disputes}} was not the only, and probably also not the most common, way of solving disputes in Árpádian Hungary. Despite {{the fact that in}} the cases of amicable settlement no written report on settlement was necessarily drawn up, still there is plenty of evidence of alternative means of dispute resolution, more than of judicial conflict resolution. The problem is, however, the conceptual distinction between judicial decision-making on the one hand and arbitration and mediation on the other. The distinction between judicial and extra-judicial dispute resolution is very vague. Disputes decided before arbitrators were essentially the same as those solved by judges. On the other hand, judges also decided cases that would probably not be eligible to end up before an arbitrator, either because they were directed against the king, or because they harmed the public order, or because they had an impact that was wider than local. Otherwise, research into primary sources makes it clear that the task of judges was, as in the case of an arbitrator or mediator, only to allow for a settlement between the parties, and only where necessary to impose a binding decision by virtue of their official competence. The final decision did not differ much from the settlement reached by the parties on their own or through an intermediary (arbitrator or mediator). Judges, just like arbitrators, invoked no legal standards (such as the laws of the first kings of Hungary) in the proceedings, and their decisions in most cases involved only granting financial compensation in favour of one of the parties, without imposing any other punishment. Their only particularity is the rarely reported use of power to impose death sentences, enslavement and some publicly humiliating sentences, such as the cutting of the hair, which seem not to be applicable within the framework of an amicable out-of-court settlement. The principal feature of conflict resolution in Árpádian Hungary, a feature that was common both to judicial and extra-judicial dispute resolution, was thus the participation of a third, essentially unbiased person. From the many sources that we examined, it appears that the aim of the dispute resolution in this period was, more than finding the real truth, to settle the case to the mutual satisfaction of the litigants. Therefore, in many proceedings, the search for truth might be given up for the sake of reconciliation. Thus the means of evidence could in the contemporary context play a completely different role. Neither the evidence in the form of written documents nor the testimony of parties or witnesses could have had the power of absolute evidence, since all the evidence was often followed by an oath or other type of ordeal. Such a relativisation of rational evidence and its isolation by a transfer into the world of the supernatural could under some specific circumstances be an intentional act aiming to leave the notions of truth and lies behind, and rather to resolve the latent issue between the parties. The “evidence” thus did not serve to reveal the truth, but rather served only as a means of establishing a compromise between the litigants with the aim of reconciliation of the parties and restoration of peace and justice, rather than mere punishment of a <b>disputing</b> <b>party...</b>|$|E
40|$|Excerpt] Although the United States has {{complied}} with adverse rulings in many past World Trade Organization (WTO) disputes, {{there are currently}} 11 cases in which rulings {{have not yet been}} implemented or the United States has taken action and the dispute has not been fully resolved. Under WTO dispute settlement rules, a WTO Member will generally be given a reasonable period of time to comply with an adverse WTO decision. While the Member is expected to remove the offending measure {{by the end of this}} period, compensation and temporary retaliation are available if the Member has not acted or taken sufficient action by this time. Either <b>disputing</b> <b>party</b> may request a compliance panel if there is disagreement over whether a Member has complied. Remaining unsettled are long-standing disputes with the European Union (EU) regarding a music copyright statute (DS 160) and a statutory trademark provision affecting property confiscated by Cuba (DS 176), as well as a dispute with Japan over a provision of U. S. antidumping law (DS 184). The Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act of 2000 (“Byrd Amendment”), which was held WTO-inconsistent in January 2003 and repealed effective October 2005, remains the target of sanctions by complainants EU and Japan due to continued payments to U. S. firms authorized under the repeal legislation (P. L. 109 - 171) (DS 217 /DS 234). Congress placed limits on funds that are available for these distributions in December 2010 (P. L. 111 - 291, § 822). In addition, the United States and Antigua have been consulting on the resolution of outstanding issues in Antigua’s challenge of U. S. online gambling restrictions (DS 285). Compensation agreements entered into by the United States with various WTO Members in exchange for the withdrawal by the United States of its WTO gambling commitments, an action taken by the United States to resolve the case, will not enter into effect until issues with Antigua are resolved. Congress repealed a WTO-inconsistent cotton program at issue in Brazil’s 2002 complaint over U. S. cotton subsidies in P. L. 109 - 171, but other programs were also successfully challenged and the United States was later found not to have fully complied (DS 267). The United States since made statutory and administrative changes affecting the export credit guarantee program faulted in the case. While Brazil obtained authorization from the WTO to retaliate in the case, the two countries entered into a preliminary agreement in April 2010 that forestalled the imposition of sanctions and signed a framework agreement in June 2010 aimed at permanently resolving the dispute. The latter includes Brazil’s pledge not to impose sanctions during the life of the agreement and contemplates possible legislative resolution of the dispute in the 2012 farm bill. Brazil had earlier announced that it was entitled to impose $ 829. 3 million in annual retaliation, $ 591 million of which would consist of import surcharges on U. S. goods. Five pending cases involve the U. S. practice of “zeroing,” under which the Department of Commerce (DOC), in calculating dumping margins in antidumping (AD) proceedings, disregards non-dumped sales. The U. S. practice was successfully challenged by the EU (DS 294 /DS 350), Japan (DS 322), Mexico (DS 344), and South Korea (DS 402), resulting in broad WTO prohibitions on U. S. use of the practice. The United States took administrative action to resolve one aspect of DS 294 by abandoning zeroing in original AD investigations as of 2007. It has yet to fully comply, however, either in this case or in DS 350, DS 322, or DS 344. While the EU and Japan requested the WTO to authorize sanctions, each agreed to suspend U. S. -requested arbitration of their proposals in 2010 on the understanding that the United States would resolve outstanding issues in a timely fashion. To this end, DOC in December 2010 proposed to eliminate the use of zeroing in later stages of U. S. AD proceedings. A compliance panel proceeding is currently under way in the dispute with Mexico (DS 344). An adverse panel report was adopted in Korea’s challenge (DS 402) on February 24, 2011...|$|E
