2500|$|On December 31, 2007, at age 77, Moore was {{released}} from prison on parole after serving 32 years of her life sentence. Ford had died from natural causes on December 26, 2006, one year and five days before her release. Moore has stated that she regrets the assassination attempt, saying she was [...] "blinded by her radical political views". Moore {{was released}} under a federal law that makes parole mandatory for inmates who have served at least 30 years of a life sentence and have maintained a satisfactory disciplinary record. When asked about her crime in an interview, Moore stated, [...] "I am very glad I did not succeed. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> I was wrong to try." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Mother, <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>now,</b> <b>that</b> I am reformed--and permanently. Permanently--and {{beyond the}} reach of any human temptation." ...|$|E
60|$|Madame la Vicomtesse had {{an answer}} {{on the tip of}} her tongue. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> she spared me.|$|E
60|$|I {{felt that}} the time of action was approaching, but <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> the first signal and {{movement}} would come from the woman, and so watched her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Talkee talkee," [...] I {{answered}} bitterly, for <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> he {{had understood}} all that passed between George and me. [...] "What for talkee talkee? You no sabbe talkee talkee." ...|$|R
60|$|And as I listened {{the sense}} of triumph filled my bitter heart, for <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> by my own hand should this ruined woman die and the justice of the Gods be done.|$|R
60|$|PRICE. Oh no ma'm. The {{windows of}} eaven av bin opened to me. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> the rich {{man is a}} sinner like myself.|$|E
60|$|THE GENERAL. Only {{that she}} wonders when I {{am going to}} grow out of it. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> I shall never grow out of it.|$|E
6000|$|... “No, came in fourth, {{the most}} irritating thing a horse can do when you’ve backed it win or place. Anyhow, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> I’m not Lady Befnal.” ...|$|E
60|$|After that I haunted {{the spot}} every time I could get away, {{creeping}} {{down to the}} river bank and lying in hiding hours long at a stretch; for <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> the otters lived there, and they gave me many glimpses of a life I had never seen before.|$|R
6000|$|... "General, I cannot," [...] I said. I {{had seen}} from the first the {{futility}} of trying to dissuade him from the expedition, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> it would never come off. I was willing to make almost any sacrifice rather than offend him, but this I could not allow. The General drew himself up {{in his chair and}} stared at me with a flash of his old look.|$|R
6000|$|... “I didn’t {{understand}} before {{only because}} <b>I</b> didn’t <b>know.</b> <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> see what I’ve {{been living with}} for years,” Stransom went on very gently.|$|R
6000|$|... "I did {{not know}} him. Kala {{told me he was}} a white ape, and hairless like myself. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> he must have been a white man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have always}} loved him," [...] Joan answered. [...] "It was he didn't love me, for a time, as I thought. But <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> he does." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{used to try}} {{to force}} {{consolation}} on people," [...] said Dr. May, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>now,</b> <b>that</b> it can only be done by following their bent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Having {{left the}} house, I {{proceeded}} {{to do what}} Gregson had neglected. I telegraphed {{to the head of}} the police at Cleveland, limiting my enquiry to the circumstances connected with the marriage of Enoch Drebber. The answer was conclusive. It told me that Drebber had already applied for the protection of the law against an old rival in love, named Jefferson Hope, and that this same Hope was at present in Europe. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> held the clue to the mystery in my hand, and all that remained was to secure the murderer.|$|R
60|$|One of {{them came}} to see her two or three times--once when {{she seemed to be}} at the point of death, and twice afterwards, reading prayers with her, to her great comfort. He spoke of her as an angel of goodness, {{spending}} all the means allowed her by her husband among her poor exiled countrymen and women. And as she used no concealment, and only took what was supplied to her for her own 'menus plaisirs,' her husband might grumble, but did not forbid. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> my brother had loved in her something more than the lovely face.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What if I {{had found}} out one who knew your brother's secret; who knew the manner of his flight, who knew where he and the {{companion}} of his flight were gone? What if I had made him utter all his knowledge, word by word, before his enemy, concealed to hear it? What if I had sat by at the time, looking into this enemy's face, and seeing it change till it was scarcely human? What if I had seen him rush away, mad, in pursuit? What if <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> <b>now,</b> <b>that</b> {{he was on his}} road, more fiend than man, and must, in so many hours, come up with him?' ...|$|R
60|$|LADY UTTERWORD. So I thought, Mr Dunn. But <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> it {{was only}} the last of my influenza. I found that I was not remembered and not wanted.|$|E
6000|$|... "The sign is sufficient. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> these Voices are of God. They {{have said}} true in this matter; {{if they have}} said more, tell it meI will believe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You ARE {{unlike other}} people," [...] she said softly, [...] "and {{that is why}} I love you. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> I must have loved you ever since I saw you." ...|$|E
60|$|Six ladies {{leaned forward}} in their places, {{and looked at me}} with {{flashing}} eyes. It was a suitable triumph for Mr. de Valentin. And yet <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>now</b> all <b>that</b> <b>I</b> desired. Dimly I began to understand the great plot, and all that it meant.|$|R
6000|$|... "There are few public {{men with}} the strain upon their time and {{energies}} which he had particularly (and which <b>I</b> <b>know</b> better <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have read his life), who would have spared the time to have written such a long courteous letter.|$|R
5000|$|Caldecott came {{to realize}} that the stories which had {{informed}} his early youth, stories of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, the Quest of the Holy Grail, and the Narnia books of C.S. Lewis and Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings reflected a Christian worldview. [...] "All along, my imagination had been built on a Christian foundation, and I had never noticed it before. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> in some sense, on some level, I was already a Christian." [...] His reading the turned to Gilson, Maritain and Aquinas. In 1980 he was baptised into the Catholic Church. This was not well-received by his father, who viewed Catholicism as [...] "worse than apartheid".|$|R
6000|$|... "Do I wish I did not?" [...] {{she said}} helplessly. [...] "I don't know. Perhaps {{that is what}} I do wish. Ah, but what are wishes! <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> they don't matter at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am not crying, Robert, because I {{have lost}} the fortune--I am crying because I am so happy. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> you love me quite for my own sake, and not for my money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do you mean? But I {{know you}} are angry with me. And yet you cannot think that I {{intended}} those words for you. Of course <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> there was nothing rude in what passed." ...|$|E
60|$|The wondrous green {{transparency}} {{had almost}} gone, the dew touched the wheat, and we stood {{alone in the}} emptiness, under the hush that crept up with the dimness from the east, and through which one {{could almost hear the}} thirsty grasses drink. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had never loved Beatrice Haldane as a man usually loves a woman, but had offered an empty homage to an unreality. Still, the semblance had once been real enough to me, and I could not wholly hold my peace and let her go. Furthermore, both she and her sister possessed the gift of forcing one's inmost thoughts, and there was a power in the quiet voice stronger than my will.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not when I see Mr. Maddox. Oh, please <b>now</b> you <b>know</b> why, don't make me walk without you. <b>I</b> do <b>know</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> {{he could}} not do {{anything}} to me, but I can't help feeling the fright. And, oh! if he was to speak to me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|There seemed such a {{stubborn}} purpose {{in her face}} and manner. It was like the look in a dog's eyes that says: 'Master, you thought to shut me up away from you; <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now</b> what <b>that</b> is like. Do what you will, I mean in future to be near you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is better}} as it is. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> I was not fit for it. When your sister came to me, I {{never thought of}} remonstrating. I knew then that I had seen it for the last time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was condescension, nevertheless," [...] said Eustacia vehemently. [...] "And if I {{had known}} then what <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now,</b> <b>that</b> I should {{be living in}} this wild heath a month after my marriage, I--I should have thought twice before agreeing." ...|$|E
60|$|I did {{not know}} then, as <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>now,</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Ranson had spoken of me, and that in {{consequence}} Captain Hannock was rather alarmed over the prospects should I get ashore. Kidnapping (as Mr. Ranson had put it) is no light crime.|$|E
60|$|We steamed on northward. At Newcastle, {{the same}} detective strolled, {{with his hands}} in his pockets, along the train once more, and puffed a cigar with the nonchalant air of a {{sporting}} gentleman. But I was certain now, from the studious unconcern he was anxious to exhibit, that he must be a spy upon us. He overdid his mood of careless observation. It was too obvious an assumption. Precisely the same thing happened again when we pulled up at Berwick. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> we were watched. It would be impossible for us to get married at Edinburgh if we were thus closely pursued. There was but one chance open; we must leave the train abruptly at the first Scotch stopping station.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{no right}} to hinder you from doing {{anything}} that may be necessary to your own comfort, but pray do not do it for my sake. Dr. Grantly never thought well of me, and never will. <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am even anxious that he should do so." ...|$|R
5000|$|Allie X {{describes}} the album's tracks as representing pieces of her. [...] "Whether it'd be a dream, a fantasy or my interpretation of reality," [...] she {{said about the}} tracks. [...] "Paper Love" [...] {{and many of the}} other songs are about that part of myself that is kind of impulsive and self-destructive, and the kind of guys I dated for a while. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>now</b> <b>that</b> I'm older a lot of that I've grown out of, but other parts I haven't out of so much. It definitely is a piece of the me that I am now." ...|$|R
