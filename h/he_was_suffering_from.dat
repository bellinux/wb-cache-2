5|$|After {{a one-day}} tournament in South Africa, West Indies {{returned}} home for Test and ODI series against Pakistan. The ODI series was drawn, but the West Indies defeated Pakistan 2–0 in the Tests. Ambrose took nine wickets at 23.11 to be {{fifth in the}} team bowling averages. The Wisden report suggested that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> fatigue after his team's busy schedule, but although not at his best, he continued to take important wickets. For Northamptonshire in 1993, Ambrose was second in the team first-class bowling averages with 59 wickets at 20.45.|$|E

5|$|Cranston {{was given}} the harshest penalty of all five senators. In November 1991, the Senate Ethics Committee voted {{unanimously}} to reprimand Cranston, instead of the more severe measure that was under consideration: censure by the full Senate. Extenuating circumstances that helped to save Cranston from censure included the fact that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> cancer, {{and that he had}} decided to not seek reelection, according to Heflin. The Ethics Committee took the unusual step of delivering its reprimand to Cranston during a formal session of the full Senate, with almost all 100 Senators present.|$|E
5|$|In 1120, the English {{political}} landscape changed dramatically. Three hundred passengers embarked on the White Ship {{to travel from}} Barfleur in Normandy to England, including {{the heir to the}} throne, William Adelin, and many other senior nobles. Stephen had intended to sail on the same ship but changed his mind at the last moment and got off to await another vessel, either out of concern for overcrowding on board the ship, or because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> diarrhoea. The ship foundered en route, and all but two of the passengers died, including William Adelin.|$|E
5|$|In January 2014, Knut's full autopsy {{results were}} {{published}} by the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in the Journal of Comparative Pathology. It was the most in-depth post-mortem ever carried out on an animal. The autopsy revealed that {{the damage to the}} bear’s brain was so severe that even if he had not fallen into the water and drowned he would have died anyway. Experts hypothesized that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> a virus that caused the encephalitis.|$|E

5|$|Soon after, Thorpe {{announced}} his {{withdrawal from the}} Commonwealth Games due to a bout of bronchitis, which had stopped him from training. Thorpe's illness was later diagnosed as a strain of glandular fever, and after a further delay caused by a broken hand, {{he moved to the}} United States in July to work with Dave Salo. Further disruption followed when the Australian switched coaches, citing excessive and ongoing media attention. Thorpe's stay was constantly surrounded by rumours that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> ill discipline; this fuelled speculation that his international career was on the decline.|$|E
5|$|After {{qualifying}} as a barrister, {{he moved}} to Birmingham in 1914, choosing the city because he had some connections there thanks to his association with Cadbury, and began work at the chambers of John Hurst. His career was aided by the outbreak of World War I; many of the younger and fitter barristers were called up for war service, whilst Birkett himself, who was thirty {{when he joined the}} bar, avoided conscription as he was declared medically unfit. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> tuberculosis, and he returned to Ulverston for six months to recover. During his time in Birmingham, he continued his work as a minister, regularly preaching at the Baptist People's Chapel.|$|E
5|$|As he neared his {{eleventh}} birthday, Gloucester {{was assigned}} the rooms in Kensington Palace {{that had been}} used by his aunt, Queen Mary, who died in 1694. At his birthday party at Windsor, on 24 July 1700, he complained of a sudden fatigue, but was initially thought to have overheated himself while dancing. By nightfall, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> a sore throat and chills, followed by a severe headache and a high fever the next day. A physician, Hannes, did not arrive until 27 July. Gloucester was immediately bled, but his condition continued to deteriorate. Over the next day, he developed a rash and suffered a bout of diarrhoea. A second physician, Gibbons, arrived early on 28 July, followed by Radcliffe that evening.|$|E

5|$|H.D. and Aldington {{attempted}} to salvage their relationship during this time, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> {{the effects of}} his participation in the war, possibly post-traumatic stress disorder, and they became estranged, living completely separate lives, but not divorcing until 1938. They remained friends, however, {{for the rest of}} their lives. From 1920, her relationship with Bryher became closer, and the pair travelled in Egypt, Greece and the United States before eventually settling in Switzerland. Bryher entered a marriage of convenience in 1921 with Robert McAlmon, which allowed him to fund his publishing ventures in Paris by utilising some of her personal wealth for his Contact Press. Both Bryher and H.D. slept with McAlmon during this time. Bryher and McAlmon divorced in 1927.|$|E
5|$|Luoyang, {{the region}} of his birthplace, was {{recovered}} by government forces {{in the winter of}} 762, and in the spring of 765 Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze, apparently with the intention of making their way there. They traveled slowly, held up by his ill-health (by this time <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> poor eyesight, deafness and general old age in addition to his previous ailments). They stayed in Kuizhou (in what is now Baidicheng, Chongqing) {{at the entrance to the}} Three Gorges for almost two years from late spring 766. This period was Du Fu's last great poetic flowering, and here he wrote 400 poems in his dense, late style.|$|E
5|$|O'Sullivan won the pro–am Pink Ribbon {{tournament in}} July 2015, {{defeating}} Darryn Walker 4–2 in the final, but took a hiatus from the professional tour for almost eight months.

5|$|Reimer {{began the}} 2011–12 {{season as the}} starter going 4–0–1. He {{suffered}} an injury on October 22 {{in a game against}} the Montreal Canadiens. During the game Reimer was run into by Brian Gionta, he finished the first period, but did not return after the intermission. The team called the injury whiplash despite rumors that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> a concussion. Reimer missed 19 games with the injury, and struggled upon his return, yielding some starts to Gustavsson. After recording two back-to-back shutouts on February 1 and February 4, Reimer seemed to have solidified the starting position once again.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{returned}} to the United States in March 1949. Truman offered him the post of Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs but General Smith declined the appointment, preferring to return to military duty. He was appointed as {{the commander of the}} First Army at Fort Jay, New York, his first command since 1918. Throughout the war, Smith had been troubled by a recurring stomach ulcer. The problem became severe in 1949. He was no longer able eat a normal diet, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> malnutrition. Smith was admitted to the Walter Reed Army Hospital, where the surgeons decided to remove most of his stomach. This did cure his ulcer, but Smith remained malnourished and thin.|$|E
5|$|Although {{dismissive of}} Young's work {{even before he}} had read it, Champollion {{obtained}} {{a copy of the}} Encyclopedia article. Even though <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> a failing health, and the chicanery of the Ultras kept him struggling to maintain his job, it motivated him to return in earnest {{to the study of the}} hieroglyphs. When he was eventually removed from his professorship by the Royalist faction, he finally had the time to work on it exclusively. While he awaited trial for treason, he produced a short manuscript, De l'écriture hiératique des anciens Égyptiens, in which he argued that the hieratic script was simply a modified form of hieroglyphic writing. Young had already anonymously published an argument to the same effect several years earlier in an obscure journal, but Champollion, having been cut off from academia, had probably not read it. In addition Champollion made the fatal error of claiming that the hieratic script was entirely ideographic. Champollion himself was never proud of this work and reportedly actively tried to suppress it by buying the copies and destroying them.|$|E

5|$|He {{was still}} {{suffering}} from the shoulder injury in June 2004, and under new manager Russell Slade, Young endured a frustrating spell. A cold <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> in August 2004 required treatment from physio Dave Moore as it put him out of action. Young joined Conference National club Northwich Victoria on 7 October 2004 on a one-month loan, having made five appearances for Grimsby {{up to that point}} in 2004–05. He made his debut two days later in a 0–0 away draw with Crawley Town. On 23 October 2014, he scored his first goal for Northwich in a 3–1 away victory over Forest Green Rovers with a close-range shot. He was recalled by Grimsby later that month due to injuries after making three appearances for Northwich. He rejoined Northwich on 3 December 2004 on another one-month loan, with injury restricting him to three appearances before returning to Grimsby on 6 January 2005.|$|E
5|$|Kirchherr and Sutcliffe went to Liverpool in {{the summer}} of 1961, as Kirchherr wanted to meet Sutcliffe's family (and to see Liverpool) before their marriage. Everybody was expecting a strange beatnik artist from Hamburg, but Kirchherr turned up at the Sutcliffe's house at 37 Aigburth Drive, Liverpool, bearing a single long-stemmed orchid in her hand as a present, and dressed in a round-necked {{cashmere}} sweater and tailored skirt. In 1962, Sutcliffe collapsed {{in the middle of an}} art class in Hamburg. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> intense headaches, and Kirchherr's mother had German doctors perform various checks on him, although they were unable to determine exactly what was causing the headaches. While living at the Kirchherrs' house in Hamburg his condition got worse. On 10 April 1962, Kirchherr's mother phoned her daughter at work and told her Sutcliffe was not feeling well, had been brought back to the house, and an ambulance had been called for. Kirchherr rushed home and rode with Sutcliffe in the ambulance, but he died in her arms before it reached the hospital.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald {{continued}} {{to expand his}} practice while being appointed director of many companies, mainly in Kingston. Macdonald became both a director of and {{a lawyer for the}} new Commercial Bank of the Midland District. Throughout the 1840s, Macdonald invested heavily in real estate, including commercial properties in downtown Toronto. Meanwhile, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>suffering</b> <b>from</b> some illness, and in 1841, his father died. Sick and grieving, he decided to take a lengthy holiday in Britain in early 1842. He left for the journey well supplied with money, as he spent the last three days before his departure gambling at the card game loo and winning substantially. Sometime during his two months in Britain, he met his first cousin, Isabella Clark. As Macdonald did not mention her in his letters home, the circumstances of their meeting are not known. In late 1842, Isabella journeyed to Kingston to visit with a sister. The visit stretched for nearly a year before John and Isabella Macdonald married on 1 September 1843.|$|E
