5|$|The {{scale of}} Our Friends in the North {{required}} BBC Two controller Michael Jackson to devote {{a budget of}} £8 million to the production, which was half of his channel's drama serials budget for the entire year. Producer Charles Pattinson attempted to gain co-production funding from overseas broadcasters, but none was interested. Pattinson believed <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> story was so much about Britain and had limited appeal to other countries. BBC Worldwide, the corporation's commercial arm which sells its programmes overseas, offered only £20,000 of funding towards the production. The speaking cast of Our Friends in the North numbered 160; more than 3,000 extras were used, and filming took place across 40 weeks, from November 1994 until September 1995.|$|E
25|$|The NCU's championships were {{considered}} the unofficial championships of the world. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> sport needed world championships independent of any national body that Henry Sturmey {{of the magazine}} The Cyclist and later founder of the Sturmey-Archer gear company proposed an International Cyclists Association in 1892. Having secured the co-operation of British officials and writers such as George Lacy Hillier, he approached other countries' national associations through the NCU.|$|E
25|$|Many {{lifeboats}} only carried half {{of their}} maximum capacity; there are many versions as to the reasoning behind half-filled lifeboats. Some sources claimed {{they were afraid of}} the lifeboat buckling under the weight, others suggested <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> crew were following strict maritime tradition to evacuate women and children first. Additionally, doors and hatches were locked to prevent passengers on the lower decks from easily gaining access to and swamping the boats. Few men were allowed into the lifeboats on the port side, while the starboard side only allowed many men into boats after women and children boarded. Some of the final lifeboats were overfilled, and passengers noticed the seawater line was near the rim on some of the lifeboats.|$|E

500|$|A {{specialist}} in Catholic social doctrine argues, circa 1994, that [...] "the words 'bank' and 'banking' are almost nonexistent {{in the documents}} of modern Catholic social teaching. Perhaps because the medieval teaching was never formally retracted that money was unproductive and therefore money lending at interest was therefore immoral, yet the church itself became an active investor.... Or perhaps <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> church was deeply involved in financial matters {{at the highest levels}} that it was in no position to criticise." ...|$|E
500|$|In May 2011, Gaga {{said her}} [...] "emotional connection" [...] {{with the song}} was difficult. When she was asked if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> song was {{originally}} written for Britney Spears, she answered: [...] "Well that’s not exactly what happened, but I don’t want to delve into that. I could delve into it if you turn that (motions to recorder) off... But ultimately the mix {{and the process of}} getting the production finished was very stressful for me. So when I say it’s my worst song {{it has nothing to do}} with the song, just my emotional connection to it." ...|$|E

However, historical records indicate the words to be [...] "Watson, come here, I want you." [...] The error was not present in Paul Cornell's original script, but crept in {{at some point during}} production. Producer Phil Collinson speculated that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> line was rerecorded; it was originally recorded by someone who the production team felt put on too false of a Scottish accent, and so it was rerecorded with a real Scot.|$|E

500|$|Houston stated {{he had not}} lobbied the Treasury for the coin, and Perkins, before {{promising}} {{to find out more}} information, speculated that perhaps <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> coins were to be issued far from the continental United States. [...] Houston told the committee that the coin was [...] "something that may be kept by those who attend the celebration as a memorial of it and will be available to foreigners who come there, as well as our own people who celebrate the occasion". [...] Kvale stated he would vote for the bill. Mississippi's Bill G. Lowrey noted that as he had said before, he would not vote for any coin bill; Perkins agreed that Lowrey had made his position clear. Perkins issued a report on February 1, 1928, recounting the history behind the proposed coin and indicating his committee's support.|$|E
500|$|Observing Wenger's {{transfer}} policy in 2009, Sir Alex Ferguson commented that it lacked balance and needed defensive players to solidfy the Arsenal team. The players Wenger recruits {{have often been}} criticised for their character and leadership capabilities; footballer Joey Barton suggested <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> manager discouraged them from commanding: [...] "Sometimes you need someone to galvanise and {{that might be a}} shouter and bawler. It may not be Arsene's way, but I think they lack that". Wenger is perceived as frugal given his inactivity in transfer windows, but he has denied the stereotype: [...] "Of course people say always to buy but you cannot make careers [...] buy every time you have an injured player. You know I have the wrong reputation. I'm not scared to spend money. The job of a manager is not to spend as much money".|$|E

[...] On September 27, 2010, Obama released a statement commenting on his religious views saying [...] "I'm a Christian by choice. My family didn't – frankly, they weren't folks who went to church every week. And my mother {{was one of the}} most spiritual people I knew, but she didn't raise me in the church. So I came to my Christian faith later in life, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead – being my brothers' and sisters' keeper, treating others as they would treat me." ...|$|E

500|$|In a {{behind the}} scenes video, Beyoncé {{revealed}} the reason behind naming the fragrance Heat. According to her, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> scent comes off as [...] "infectious", further elaborating: [...] "It's like something you can't get enough of. It's hot, it's sexy, it definitely {{makes you feel like}} you caught the fever." [...] She additionally stated that her favorite fragrance notes are red vanilla orchid, due to its [...] "sexy" [...] and [...] "spicy" [...] smell, and honeysuckle, due to its [...] "sensual" [...] and [...] "sweet" [...] smell. She concluded: [...] "It was a lot of work but I was really really happy and I think it's something I'll be proud of 20 years from now." [...] During an interview with Teen Vogue, Beyoncé stated that she loved the perfume because it featured notes of orchid, her favorite flower. She further said that it was suitable for her alter ego Sasha Fierce as it was [...] "fiery".|$|E
500|$|Mercedes-Benz withdrew {{entirely from}} motor racing {{at the start}} of 1932 {{in the face of the}} {{economic}} crisis, so Caracciola moved to Alfa Romeo with a promise to return to Mercedes if they resumed racing. His contract stipulated he would begin racing for the Italian team as a semi-independent. Caracciola later wrote that the Alfa Romeo manager was defensive when he questioned him about this clause; Caracciola believed <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> firm's Italian drivers did not believe he could change from the huge Mercedes cars to the much smaller Alfa Romeos. His first race for his new team was at the Mille Miglia; he led early in the race, but retired when a valve connection broke. Caracciola later wrote, [...] "I can still see the expression on [...] Campari's face when I arrived back at the factory. He smiled to himself as if to say, Well, didn't I tell you that one wasn't going to make it?" ...|$|E
500|$|Lee Garlington {{was cast}} as Claire the Waitress, who {{in an earlier}} draft of the episode was called [...] "Meg". Though {{initially}} cast as a series regular, the character was replaced with Elaine Benes when the series was picked up for a first season. Accounts differ on {{the reason why the}} character was replaced. Warren Littlefield has said that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> character's occupation: [...] "I thought that as a waitress she'd never be one of the gang. She'd be relegated to pouring coffee, catching up. So I insisted they create a female character they wanted to spend time with". Dennis Bjorklund of Seinfeld Reference has suggested that the character was dropped in favor of a female character with more sex appeal. However, Alexander said that Garlington was written out of the series because she had re-written her scene and given it to David, who was not happy with this. Seinfeld has, however, stated that this was not the reason the character was removed from the show, but rather that the producers were looking for [...] "someone who was more involved". Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who would go on to replace Garlington, has stated that she was not aware of the pilot before becoming a regular on the show, and she will never watch it out of superstition.|$|E

500|$|Modern Life Is Rubbish was {{released}} in the United States by Blur's American record label SBK in December 1993—seven months after the album's UK release. This delay was because SBK's alternative-music department had closed down; Blur manager Chris Morrison later quipped, [...] "When I asked [...] why, they said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> girl had left." [...] Despite fears that Modern Lifes overt Englishness would be lost on the American market, SBK insisted on marketing the album to MOR stations and aimed for Top 40 airplay. The label largely ignored Morrison's arguments that Blur's best chance of exposure in America would be to court college radio-stations. SBK's strategy was to list the album at a developing-artist price (around three dollars less than standard), send the band on an intensive tour in 1994 and to target modern rock airplay with debut single [...] "Chemical World". The record company believed this would help expand on the base audience who bought Leisure, and eventually open Blur to Top 40 radio. Further, to lessen the anglocentric feel of the record, SBK added additional songs to the track-listing—including [...] "Popscene". The plan fared rather poorly, as Modern Life barely had any impact in the US; the album didn't chart on the US Billboard 200 and sold only 19,000 copies, a sharp decline compared to the 87,000 units that Leisure shifted.|$|E
500|$|The {{death of}} Luna, the most {{brilliant}} and capable of the Filipino generals at the time, was a decisive factor {{in the fight against}} the American forces. Despite mixed reactions on both the Filipino and American sides on the death of Luna, there are people from both sides who nevertheless developed an admiration for him. General Frederick Funston, who received the credit of capturing Aguinaldo at Palanan, Isabela, stated that Luna was the [...] "ablest and most aggressive leader of the Filipino Republic." [...] For General James Franklin Bell, Luna [...] "was the only general the Filipino army had." [...] General Robert Hughes remarked that [...] "with the death of General Luna, the Filipino army lost the only General it had." [...] Meanwhile, Apolinario Mabini, former Prime Minister and Secretary of Foreign Affairs, had this to say: [...] "If he was sometimes hasty and even cruel in his resolution, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> army had been brought to a desperate situation by the demoralization of the soldiers and the lack of ammunitions: nothing but action of rash courage and extraordinary energy could hinder its dissolution." [...] Of the Filipino armed forces organized during Luna's service in the army, Major General Henry Ware Lawton commented, [...] "Filipinos are a very fine set of soldiers, far better than the Indians... Inferior in every particular equipment and supplies, they are the bravest men I have ever seen... I'm very well impressed with the Filipinos!" [...] This statement Lawton later recanted.|$|E
500|$|The three coinage bills—Maine Centennial, Alabama Centennial, and Pilgrim Tercentenary—were {{considered}} {{in that order}} by the House of Representatives on April 21, 1920. As the Maine and Alabama pieces were considered, Ohio's Warren Gard asked {{a number of questions}} about various matters, including regarding the wisdom of having so many half dollar designs issued, though he did not object to the passage of either bill. After the Pilgrim bill came to the floor, Gard asked Walsh why the bill provided for 500,000 half dollars, so much more than for the state coins; Walsh responded that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> coin was for a 300th anniversary rather than just a 100th. [...] Gard followed up this point, asking {{if it had been a}} 400th anniversary, whether even more coins would be justified, and Walsh agreed. Both Walsh and Vestal were asked by Gard how many half dollars were in circulation, but neither legislator knew. Washington Representative John Franklin Miller asked whether the coin was to commemorate the original landing of the Pilgrims at Provincetown or their subsequent landing at Plymouth, but Walsh did not answer the question definitively. Congressman James W. Dunbar of Indiana noted that the price of silver had risen so high that the Mint might be out of pocket in striking the coins, and asked if the federal government would cover any losses; Vestal responded that Massachusetts would. Vestal then moved the committee amendment to reduce the authorized mintage from 500,000 to 300,000, attracting the attention of Gard, who asked the reason for the change and was told the original bill had a typographical error. Walsh had told the committee that he had selected the figure of 500,000 since the Pilgrim anniversary was more important than the Maine state centennial. Gard enquired if the amendment had been approved by the committee, and when he was told it had, asked if the Pilgrim half dollars would buy more than ordinary half dollars to which Walsh replied, [...] "why, I think very likely, especially on Cape Cod." [...] Gard indicated his hope that he could spend a few days there that summer, and Vestal stated that Gard would be welcome to obtain and spend half dollars in any of the three states celebrating anniversaries. The bill passed the House without recorded opposition.|$|E

40|$|Interest in {{essential}} dimension problems {{has been}} growing over the past decade. In part, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> idea of essential dimension captures quite elegantly the problem of parametrizing {{a wide range of}} algebraic objects. But perhaps more, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> study of essential dimension requires most of the algebraic arsenal. What began as a problem in Galois cohomology and representation theory now has connections to versal torsors, stacks, motives, birational geometry, and invariant theory. This exposition will focus on just a small bit of this theory: algebraic tori and how they can be used to help us calculate the essential p-dimension for PGLn...|$|R
