40|$|Turbulent {{structures}} {{near the}} wall and the the surface have been studied in open channel flows using oxygen bubble visualization techniques. Experiments indicate that the flow is dominated by the generation of wall ejections and interactions of such structures with the free surface. The ejections are seen to evolve near the wall, reach the free surface, form surface patches, roll back and mix into the bulk flow. Furthermore, there are evidence of ``horseshoe`` and ``hockeystick`` type vortices in relation to the bursting events. Measurements of surface characteristics show that the ejection-inflow events are associated with deformation of the free surface. It is seen that as ejections reach the free surface, the surface goes through a rise, whereas the surface falls when the <b>inflowing</b> <b>fluid</b> returns toward the wall. These effects are enhanced as the flow Reynolds number is increased...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} model for Diffusive Shock Acceleration (DSA) in which {{stochastic}} magnetic fields in the shock precursor are generated through purely fluid mechanisms of a so-called small-scale dynamo. This contrasts with previous DSA models that considered magnetic fields amplified through cosmic ray streaming instabilities; i. e., either by way of individual particles resonant scattering in the magnetic fields, or by macroscopic electric currents associated with large-scale cosmic ray streaming. Instead, in our picture, the solenoidal velocity perturbations that are required for the dynamo to work are produced through the interactions of the pressure gradient of the cosmic ray precursor and density perturbations in the <b>inflowing</b> <b>fluid.</b> Our estimates show that this mechanism provides fast growth of magnetic field and is very generic. We argue that for supernovae shocks the mechanism is capable of generating upstream magnetic fields that are sufficiently strong for accelerating cosmic rays up to around 10 ^ 16 eV. No action of any other mechanism is necessary. Comment: 10 pages, 5 figures, ApJ accepte...|$|E
40|$|Appendices to {{this thesis}} are {{available}} at [URL] study considers the motion of river water flowing into a lake. The study has two parts: field observations of an interflowing river in Lake Iseo (Italy); and laboratory experiments on basins fed by an underflow. In both, observations are compared to existing and new models. There is significant uncertainty in predicting contaminant transport from inflows to lakes. Reducing the uncertainty contributes both to understanding lake ecosystems and protecting water resources. In field observations, the progressive stages of the inflow were interpreted as a laterally falling plunge region with little mixing, an underflow region with substantial mixing, and finally an intrusion. A simple theory for a laterally falling plunge region was developed, giving the ratio of offshore extent of the plunge region to river width as equal to the initial densimetric Froude number. This theory agreed with the observed plunge location better than existing models. In laboratory experiments, the evolving density stratification in a basin fed by underflowing gravity currents was measured. The transport pathway of the <b>inflowing</b> <b>fluid</b> was visualised with dyes. Gravity currents underflowing uniform ambient uid over an intermediate range of source Reynolds number (Re_s) at constant Richardson number (Ri) had entrainment coefficients (E) that varied linearly with Res. The values for E were within the previously observed range, but were lower than previously observed for the Ri used here, because Re_s was lower here than in previous studies. Dye pulses showed that gravity currents in stratified ambients did not only entrain, as occurs when in uniform ambient fluid, but also effluxed fluid over the whole depth of the stratified ambient. Analytical expressions were developed for the evolving stratification generated by efflux from the gravity current. The new efflux model predicted the observed stratifications more closely than existing entrainment models. The efflux model could better match observations by including the continued mixing that occurs within the stratified ambient and including the undiluted sublayer observed within the gravity current. Future work should quantify efflux from gravity currents and incorporate the efflux mechanism into full lake basin simulations. Given the deviation of existing entrainment models from observations shown here, a better model of gravity current efflux would improve modelling of lakes {{and a variety of}} buoyancy driven flows, from building ventilation to ocean circulation...|$|E

30|$|To {{overcome}} {{the limitations of}} manual measurement a variety of automated systems have been developed. These will continuously calculate the fluid deficit by measuring the weight difference between the <b>inflow</b> <b>fluid</b> bags and the reservoirs collecting the outflow fluid. Some {{are also designed to}} give an alarm if there is a suspected perforation and the fluid loss is more than 300  ml/min or give automated alerts at every 250  ml of fluid deficit. Automated systems also compensate for the discrepancy in the actual volume of fluid in the bags. The theatre team should be cautious to ensure there is no fluid escaping from the drapes, as this can overestimate the fluid deficit. The costs of automated systems have precluded widespread usage but they appear to be beneficial in prolonged cases where fluid absorption is anticipated e.g., TCRE, TCRF, adhesiolysis and septoplasty.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, cavity aspect {{ratios and}} <b>fluid</b> <b>inflow</b> {{velocities}} of an idealized perfusion cavity micro-bioreactor for embryos were examined using {{computational fluid dynamics}} simulations. Changes to aspect ratios led to altered flow structures and concentration distributions of fluid solutes within the cavity. When cavity aspect ratios were decreased to less than unity, the resulting transport of solutes was impaired, but relatively low shear stresses {{were found to be}} imposed on the enclosed embryo. Conversely, when aspect ratios were greater to than unity, more efficient solute transport was observed, however detrimentally increased levels of shear stresses were imposed on the embryo. Variation in solute concentrations within the cavity became very small as cavity aspect ratios were increased to larger than four. Changes of <b>inflow</b> velocities of <b>fluid</b> (culture medium) into the bioreactor were also found to have substantial impact on the flow structures and solute concentration distributions within the cavity. With low <b>inflow</b> velocities, <b>fluid</b> movement in the bioreactor were dominated by diffusion, with impaired solute transport within the cavity and relatively low shear stresses imposed on the embryo. Conversely, high <b>inflow</b> velocities caused <b>fluid</b> flow in the bioreactor to be dominated by advection, promoting solute transport but leading to relatively high shear stresses. The flow Peclet number (Pe) can be used to distinguish whether the flow is advection dominant (Pe > 1) or diffusion dominant (Pe < 1). Overall, both parametric studies provided information that would be highly useful to the design of an optimized perfusion micro-bioreactor for early embryos. For example, one could select the optimum cavity shape to breed certain types of embryo based on the findings from the cavity aspect ratio study or make an informed choice in setting the suitable flow rates based on the findings from the <b>fluid</b> <b>inflow</b> velocity study...|$|R

30|$|Since tendon grafts become {{anchored}} into bone with Sharpey-like fibers (Oguma et al. 2001; Tomita et al. 2001), a {{close fit}} to the bone tunnel may be advantageous in graft anchoring by avoiding the <b>inflow</b> of joint <b>fluid.</b> Because the semitendinosus tendon is soft tissue, it is generally thought that a semitendinosus tendon graft can change the cross sectional shape to {{fit to the}} round tunnel and prevent the <b>inflow</b> of joint <b>fluid</b> (Toritsuka et al. 2003). The present study {{showed that even though}} the cross-sectional areas of cadavers 1 to 5 were larger than that of the aluminum tunnels (52.3  mm 2), the grafts could be inserted to the aluminum tunnel. Therefore, we speculate that there was some pressure registered by each sensor. However, in the round tunnel, no pressure was detected at the vertical sensor. Fujii showed that the center of the graft shifted more than 1  mm inside a simulated 7.0 -mm diameter round tunnel with 30  N at a graft angle of 75 ° (Fujii et al. 2014). In their observations, the initial shift occurred when the graft was bent in the vertical direction. Our results showed less vertical contact versus bilateral contact in the round tunnel, which indicates that the bending direction may be a reason for the initial graft shift. This finding, when considered with the results of the Fujii’s study, suggests that there is an invisible space in a round tunnel that may not be presented in a rectangular tunnel.|$|R

40|$|Highlights • Magmatic chlorine-excess is {{a highly}} {{sensitive}} tracer of hydrothermal contamination. • Red Sea magmas show Cl-excess more extreme than even fast spreading ridges. • High-Cl Red Sea environment produces high-Cl hydrothermally altered crust and magmatic Cl-excess. • (Ultra) slow-spreading ridge magmas can assimilate hydrothermally altered crust. • Magmatic Cl-excess can guide hydrothermal prospection in the Red Sea. Abstract Newly formed oceanic crust is initially cooled by circulating seawater, although where this occurs and over what regions fluids enter the crust is still unclear. Differences in the chlorine (Cl) concentrations between mid-ocean ridge basalt and seawater potentially make Cl a sensitive tracer for this hydrothermal circulation, allowing assimilation of hydrothermal fluids or hydrothermally altered crust by rising magma to be traced by measuring excess Cl in erupted lavas. Such excess Cl {{has been found in}} basalts from fast-spreading ridges (Cl concentrations up to 1200 ppm), but not so far on ultraslow- and slow-spreading ridges, where lower Cl values in the basalts (50 – 200 ppm) make variations harder to measure. The Red Sea, with its relatively saline bottom water (40 – 42 ‰, cf. 35 ‰ salinity in open ocean water), the presence of axial brine pools (up to 270 ‰ salinity) and thick evaporite sequences flanking the young rift provides an ideal opportunity to study the incorporation of hydrothermal Cl at an ultraslow- to slow-spreading ridge (max. 1. 6 cm/yr). Both absolute Cl concentrations (up to 1300 ppm) and ratios of Cl to elements of similar mantle incompatibility (e. g. K, Nb) are much higher in Red Sea basalts than for average ultraslow- and slow-spreading ridges. An origin of these Cl-excesses by seafloor weathering or syn-eruptive contamination can be excluded, as can mineral/melt fractionation during melting or crystallisation, based on trace element data. Instead, the incorporation of Cl at depth derived from hydrothermal circulation either by direct assimilation of hydrothermal fluids or through mixing of magma with partial melts of the hydrothermally altered crust is indicated. We see no influence of local spreading rate, the intensity of seafloor fracturing or the calculated depth of last crystal fractionation on Cl-excess. Seafloor areas with clear evidence of present or recent hydrothermal activity (brine pool temperatures above ambient, presence of hydrothermal sediments) always show Cl-excess in the local basalts and there is a positive correlation between Cl-excess and intensity of local volcanism (as determined by the percentage of local seafloor showing volcanic bathymetric forms). From this we conclude that Cl-excess in basalts is related to high crustal temperatures and hydrothermal circulation and so can be used to prospect for active or recently extinct hydrothermal systems. Samples recovered within 5 km of a seafloor evaporite outcrop show particularly high Cl-excesses, suggesting addition of Cl from the evaporites to the <b>inflow</b> <b>fluids</b> and that this may be the length scale over which hydrothermal recharge occurs...|$|R
30|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the possible pathways for <b>fluid</b> <b>inflow</b> into the Soultz and adjacent geothermal fields (e.g. the Rittershoffen field). On a graben-wide scale, Illies and Greiner ([1979]) stated that convective heat transport occurs along N-S-striking fracture zones, because they are favourably oriented with respect to the present-day stress field to be reactivated. On a local scale, Bächler et al. ([2003]) have shown that these graben-parallel faults are capable of hosting hydrothermal convection organized into cells. Additionally, on intermediate scale between Speyer and Soultz, Schill et al. ([2009]) pointed out that major thermal anomalies are related to horst structures. Internally in the Soultz horst, an electrical conductivity anomaly indicating hydrothermal circulation is observed at the western horst boundary fault, only (Geiermann and Schill [2010]). Thus, it may be concluded that only part of the faults is capable of hosting fluid circulation.|$|R

40|$|Well {{control is}} needed during {{drilling}} operations {{to maintain a}} stable and safe well. Moving towards deeper wells with higher pressures and temperatures makes the operational working window smaller and more complicated than for conventional wells. In this work some of the challenges when dealing with a HPHT well environment are identified. During conventional well operations it is desirable to keep the well pressures above the pore pressure and below the fracture pressure in the formation. This is to avoid <b>inflow</b> of formation <b>fluids</b> into the wellbore or the flow of drilling mud into the formation. The pore pressure prognosis is therefore very important in the casing and drilling mud design. The well control aspects are described focusing on kick causes, kick detection and the well kill procedures. The simulation set up {{was based on a}} constructed HPHT well case. The simulations and analysis in this work is focused on pressure and volume development in the well during a kick circulation, focusing on the differences when circulating out a kick in OBM, where the gas will dissolve in the mud, and a WBM, where gas migration will occur. A comparison between a kick circulated out in an OBM and in a WBM shows that in general the well pressures and gas volumes in the well will be higher when the kick is taken in a WBM Simulations were also done looking at the pressure effect experienced when performing connections and swabbing operations. Here it was shown that the pressure drop experienced during connections can lead to an underbalanced situation where we get an <b>inflow</b> of formation <b>fluids.</b> It is also seen that the pressure drop during connections increases in smaller hole section and it is also seen that the swabbing effect during tripping out of the well can be reduced by pumping out of the hole.

The swabbing effect also gets worse in smaller hole sections...|$|R
40|$|In two {{different}} experimental environments the isolated turtle ventricle {{was found to}} fill and eject blood {{in the absence of}} a positive filling pressure. It is concluded that the ventricle can "suck" fluid using energy liberated from its wall during diastole. THE question of ventricular "suction,"that is "Does energy derived from theventricle contribute to its filling in diastole? " has been debated from the time Erasistratus to the present and has recently been critically reviewed by Brecher. 1 A recent film and abstract by Bloom 2 offer support of the "suction " concept. The ultimate proof of suction as a physio-logic aid to filling should rest on a demonstra-tion that, {{in the absence of a}} filling head, the ventricle develops a drop in intraventricular pressure which is sufficient to and actually does produce inflow. Because of the very low resistance of the A-V orifice the pressure dif-ference necessary for inflow is very small and has not been measurable directly with existing apparatus except when inflow is impeded artificially. The pressure difference, then, must be inferred from the fact of flow. A positive filling head can be eliminated by the total immersion of the ventricle in fluid at any depth. In this way the filling head at any point within the heart chambers is exactly counter-balanced by the external pressure at that depth. In this way any inflow indicates that the heart wall has been instrumental in producing a lowering of intracardiac pressure and the consequent <b>inflow</b> of <b>fluid.</b> Two series of experiments on the excised ventricle of the turtle are here presented to throw light on this question...|$|R
