40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two essays on diversification benefits, return characteristics, {{and the performance of}} U. S. -based <b>global</b> government <b>bond</b> mutual funds. The first essay examines: (i) the performance of U. S. -based <b>global</b> government <b>bond</b> funds, (ii) the benefits of inclusion of U.

The second essay studies: (i) the usefulness of style analysis on <b>global</b> <b>bond</b> funds, (ii) the style-adjusted performance of U. S. -based <b>global</b> <b>bond</b> funds, and (iii) the investment behavior of <b>global</b> <b>bond</b> fund managers. This study is important because it is the first to provide a complete study of diversification benefits, return characteristics, and style-adjusted performance measurement and performance evaluation of a large sample of U. S. -based <b>global</b> government <b>bond</b> funds. It is also first in casting U. S. -based <b>global</b> government <b>bond</b> funds investment as an alternative investment to U.

40|$|We {{test for}} the {{existence}} of a moral hazard effect attributable to official crisis lending by analyzing the evolution of sovereign bond spreads in emerging markets before and after the Russian crisis. The nonbailout of Russia in August 1998 is interpreted as an event that decreased the perceived probability of future crisis lending to emerging markets. In the presence of moral hazard, such an event should raise not only the level of spreads, but also the sensitivity with which spreads reflect fundamentals as well as their cross-country dispersion.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the roles of}} U. S. financial innovation, financial globalization, and the savings glut hypothesis in explaining the rise in U.

Perhaps surprisingly, financial deepening and falling home bias in industrialized countries explain {{a large share of}} external financing. The savings glut hypothesis (including difficult-to-track petrodollar recycling) and U. S. financial innovation are also important, in part as a cause of declining home bias in industrialized countries. The latter underscores the importance of not looking at these factors in isolation, but rather as a constellation of forces that can be self-reinforcing.

All announcements affect market volatility. Data and policy announcements reduce uncertainty and stabilize the trading environment, while rating actions cause greater volatility. Results are broadly robust to country-specific and panel analyses, assuming conditional variance and controlling for the surprise content of news. In subsamples, announcements are found to matter less for countries with more transparent policies and higher credit ratings. In a crisis, rating actions become less important, and investors focus more on simple and timely indicators, like CPI.

40|$|The use of {{collateral}} {{has become}} one of the most widespread risk mitigation techniques. While it brings stabilizing effects to the individual lender we argue that it may exacerbate systemic risk through margin call activation. We show how a liquidity shock to the cash lender may propagate as a solvency shock via liquidity hoarding even if the cash lender remains solvent in all states of nature. Albeit a cost-effective response of the cash lender to a liquidity shock, liquidity hoarding may lead to the bankruptcy of its repo counterparties triggering contagion across asset classes. To buttress the resilience of the financial system, we lay out a menu of macroprudential policies that deactivate this channel of financial contagion.

5000|$|The {{final report}} of the CIAC was {{presented}} in November 2008; among its arguments were the declaration of [...] "illegitimacy" [...] to the commercial tranches and the need of recognizing the joint responsibly comprehended in managing the debt, the annulment of illegitimate obligations and the compensation for the damages caused. President, Rafael Correa, declared on 12 December the moratorium of the external debt, on the tranche of <b>Global</b> <b>bonds</b> 2012 and 2030. <b>Global</b> <b>bonds</b> 2010 represented a capital of 510 million dollars. In February 2009, he likewise declared the moratorium on <b>Global</b> <b>bonds</b> 2030; they added up to a capital of 2,700 million dollars. With this declaration, Correa undertook {{the definition of a}} proposal directed to creditors, despite the warnings from the market analysts that the country would suffer the terrible consequences of having refused to pay the debt when it had all the necessary resources in order to do so.The market speculated on the scope of Ecuador’s plan. Options revolved around the renegotiation, restructuration, repurchase, exchange of documents, among others. The official proposal was presented on 20 April 2009; it consisted on repurchasing the bonds in circulation for up to 35 cents of their nominal values (price ceiling), appealing to an inverse reverse auction mechanism, by which the owed amount reduced just as the due date for closing the operation got closer. Ecuador finally announced, on June of the same year, that through the operation it had repurchased the bonds with a discount of up to 70 per cent. According to reports from the Minister of Finance of that time, Elsa Viteri, the net savings that came from this operation were 2,000 million dollars. However, when adding the savings concerning the service of the bonds, if their original settlement due date had arrived, the country saved 7,500 million dollars, according to Viteri. Ecuador, buy means of the repurchase and other actions concerning the management of its public debt, succeeded in lowering the service of its external obligations from almost the 40% to the 22% of the General Budget of the State. The balance of the debt reduced, in net terms, by more than 3,000 million and the service by 331.2 million dollars a year. With these achievements, during the last five years, social investment grew significantly from 1,980 to 5,197 million dollars between 2006 and 2011. Poverty, at national scale, decreased from 37.6% to 28.6%, during the same years. Rural poverty was reduced from 60.6 to 50.9 per cent.

50|$|The WCU was {{proposed}} by Lok Sang Ho of Lingnan University, Hong Kong. The WCU was first {{intended to be}} the basis for denominating <b>global</b> <b>bonds,</b> a debt instrument that is issued globally and is subscribable by people and institutions around the world. Simply put, it is a GDP-weighted basket of key currencies each of which is indexed against inflation for the relevant countries. The WCU is defined with respect to a base year, so that each unit represents the same global purchasing power as at that base year. The unindexed basket, called the benchmark basket of key currencies, is the basis for the derivation of effective exchange rate indices that has been demonstrated to be both easy to compile and superior to most official effective exchange rate indices.|$|E
50|$|The World Currency Unit (WCU) is an indexed {{unit of account}} (unit of account) {{that stands}} for a unit of real global {{purchasing}} power. Proposed by Lok Sang Ho of Lingnan University, Hong Kong, it was first intended to {{be the basis for}} denominating <b>global</b> <b>bonds,</b> a debt instrument that is issued globally and subscribable by people and institutions around the world. Since each unit by design represents a stable unit of purchasing power, the stipulated interest rate on WCU-denominated bonds represents a real interest rate. In principle, the common denomination of bonds by issuers from {{different parts of the world}} using the WCU, as well as the greater transparency of real interest rates, will produce more efficient capital markets, as savers and borrowers around the world converge in their understanding of what each basis point of interest means and are protected against two key sources of uncertainty, namely inflation and exchange loss risks.|$|E
