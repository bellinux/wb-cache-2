40|$|International audienceA {{methodology}} for obtaining a nanocrystalline Al 91 -Mn 6 -Nd 3 alloy and characterizing its mechanical properties is presented. The fabrication procedure, {{based on the}} melt spinning method, allowed the preparation of thin ribbons of not, vert, similar 30 μm in thickness. The hardness and elastic modulus have been determined by classical and instrumented indentation tests considering {{the influence of the}} ribbon thickness on the indentation measurements. The Martens hardness has been calculated by means of instrumented indentation tests, for which the <b>fixing</b> <b>support</b> of the sample has no influence on the indentation measurement. The results have been subsequently compared with those obtained from classical Vickers hardness measurements, for which some composite hardness models have been applied in order to separate the contribution of the <b>fixing</b> <b>support</b> to the hardness measurement. It has been concluded that both methodologies lead to similar values for the mechanical properties of the alloy, i. e. not, vert, similar 3. 4 GPa for the macrohardness and not, vert, similar 3. 8 MPa m 1 / 2 for the hardness length-scale factor of the material. The elastic modulus of the material, resulting from the analysis of the unloading indentation curves, {{has been found to be}} not, vert, similar 131 GPa...|$|E
40|$|Mangrove {{vegetation}} includes plants {{ranging from}} herbs, shrubs to tall trees. In favourable conditions the mangrove trees can form dense forests in intertidal habitats. However; {{only a few}} species form a massive canopy. The main characteristic features of these special type of plants are the tidal amplitude, defined by the species, {{and their ability to}} tolerate high salinity and stress. The majority of the plant groups have adaptations like prop and stilt roots for <b>fixing</b> <b>support</b> and the pneumatophores otherwise called the breathing roots for exchanging gases and the viviparous germination. In addition to these, the plants have leathery, dark, ever green leaves with deeply embeded stomata and aquous tissues...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Mining user {{profiles}} is {{a crucial}} task for Web usage mining, and {{can be accomplished by}} mining frequent patterns. However, in the Web usage domain, sessions tend to be very sparse, and mining the right user profiles tends to be difficult. Either too few or too many profiles tend to be mined, partly because of problems in <b>fixing</b> <b>support</b> thresholds and intolerant matching. Also, in the Web usage mining domain, there is often a need for post-processing and validation of the results of mining. In this paper, we use criterion guided optimization to mine localized and error-tolerant transaction patterns, instead of using exact counting based method, and explore the effect of different post-processing options on their quality. Experiments with real Web transaction data are presented. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{target of}} this {{research}} is to study the property of the assumptions in the yield line theory and to give practical design method to be used in design. This work is meant to cover an investigation of six slabs. The support condition of these slabs were simply <b>supported,</b> simply and <b>fixed</b> <b>supported,</b> and <b>fixed.</b> The reinforcement arrangement used is isotropic reinforcement. The yield line theory was used as the method of solution to obtain the ultimate load. To verify the analytical results, experimentally the six rectangular two- way slabs subjected to uniformly distributed load are simulated by 16 point loads with various combinations of the possible boundary conditions (simply supported at all edges, <b>fixed</b> <b>supported</b> at one short edge and simply supported at the remaining edges, <b>fixed</b> <b>supported</b> at one long edge and simply supported at the remaining edges, <b>fixed</b> <b>supported</b> at two short edges and simply supported at the other edges, <b>fixed</b> <b>supported</b> at two long edges and simply supported at the two short edges, and the last slab was <b>fixed</b> <b>supported</b> at all edges. Data of the experimental work including deflection readings, and yield line patterns are presented.) Experimental results are discussed and comparisons are made between the theoretical and experimental result. Finally conclusions are drawn and recommendations are presented. It can be concluded that the difference between the experimental and theoretical failure loads were small and mainly on the conservative side. Significant increase in load carrying capacity of isotropically reinforced <b>fixed</b> <b>supported</b> slabs is due to compressive membrane action imposed by horizontal restraints. Also similar yield line patterns for theoretical and experimental cases were observed...|$|R

40|$|The {{long period}} and {{conditions}} of operation are the cause of various types of severe damage to cranes used in the steelworks industry. Among the more dangerous and difficult to eliminate crane damage types, there is excess durable deflection of its supports from vertical axis. The object {{of the study is}} the semi-portal grab bridge-crane with steel lattice structure, for which deflection of a <b>fixed</b> <b>support</b> was detected that several times exceeded permissible values. For this crane, rectification was performed aimed at bringing <b>fixed</b> <b>supports</b> to the vertical line by stabilisation of the corrected location of the bearing structure of the crane using additional angle braces. The analysis of periodical geodetic measurements of the crane structure showed insufficient effect of the rectification, whereas loss of stability of some rods in the <b>fixed</b> <b>support</b> was detected. The study involved the FEM strength analysis of the crane, which revealed that the applied rectification method caused redistribution of forces in the rods of the <b>fixed</b> <b>support,</b> resulting in the loss of stability of some rods of the support, thus questioning the effectiveness of the rectification method applied...|$|R

A finite element model was created that incorporates realistic constitutive and surface interaction models. These models allow for a good prediction of the soil/structure interaction and the structural response. Three critical model responses were identified...|$|R
