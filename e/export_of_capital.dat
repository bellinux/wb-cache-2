25|$|Recklessness, greed, and overoptimism {{played a}} part in the early-20th-century {{financial}} crisis on the Canadian wheat frontier. Beginning in 1916, the Palliser Triangle, a semiarid region in Alberta and Saskatchewan, suffered a decade of dry years and crop failures that culminated in financial ruin for many of the region's wheat farmers. Overconfidence on the part of farmers, financiers, the Canadian Pacific, and the Canadian government led to land investments and development in the Palliser on an unprecedented and dangerous scale. A large share of this expansion was funded by mortgage and loan companies in Britain eager to make overseas investments.

50|$|Near {{the start}} of the 20th century, Vladimir Lenin claimed that state use of {{military}} power to defend capitalist interests abroad was an inevitable corollary of monopoly capitalism.

5000|$|Around {{the time}} that Trotsky settled in Vienna as a {{journalist}} in exile, after escaping from Siberia a second time, the Austro-Marxist Rudolf Hilferding wrote his famous book Finance Capital (first published in 1910) in which Hilferding mentions an idea very similar to Trotsky's. The passage occurs in chapter 22 on [...] "the <b>export</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> and the struggle for economic territory". It has never been proved whether Hilferding was influenced in any way by what Trotsky had written, although it is known they corresponded with each other, but Hilferding's own analysis of [...] "the latest phase of capitalist development" [...] certainly influenced {{a whole generation of}} socialist leaders. Among other things, Hilferding states:The <b>export</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital,</b> especially since it has assumed the form of industrial and finance capital, has enormously accelerated the overthrow of all the old social relations, and the involvement of the whole world in capitalism. Capitalist development did not take place independently in each individual country, but instead capitalist relations of production and exploitation were imported along with capital from abroad, and indeed imported at the level already attained in the most advanced country. Just as a newly established industry today does not develop from handicraft beginnings and techniques into a modern giant concern, but is established from the outset as an advanced capitalist enterprise, so capitalism is now imported into a new country in its most advanced form and exerts its revolutionary effects far more strongly and in a much shorter time than was the case, for instance, in the capitalist development of Holland and England.Hilferding's insight was rarely noticed by English-speaking Marxists. His book Finance Capital, which went out of print several times, was never translated into English until 1981 (i.e. 70 years later). After the publication of Lenin's classic interpretation of imperialism as the highest (and final) stage of capitalism in 1917, most Marxist writers based their analyses of imperialism on Lenin's book. Even though, on several occasions throughout the book, Lenin cites Hilferding approvingly, by {{the time that}} Hilferding became Finance Minister in Germany in 1923, the Marxist-Leninists regarded him as a reformist renegade, and his analyses were no longer trusted or taken seriously.|$|E

40|$|The carbon {{emissions}} abatement, undertaken by some countries, may induce {{other countries to}} increase their own emissions. This effect, known as "carbon leakage", {{may be due to}} rather different mechanisms. The simplest case is when outside countries do not change their environmental policies and world prices are fixed. Unilateral policies may then induce a substitution of domestic production, generating emissions, with imports. This paper analyses the carbon leakage generated under the "small open economy" assumption, illustrating some findings through a numerical, dynamic, general equilibrium model of the Italian economy. The analysis highlights two main points. First, in a general equilibrium setting, the carbon leakage depends on both the substitution and income effects. Income effects, in turn, crucially depend on how carbon tax revenues are recycled, or pollution rights rents are assigned. Different recycling schemes have rather different impacts on the national income and on the trade-induced leakage. Second, carbon leakage may be significantly affected by the degree <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> mobility in international markets, because capital services enter the balance <b>of</b> trade. <b>Capital</b> outflows amount to <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> services, possibly financing the import of carbon-intensive goods. This result suggests that, in a world of increasingly integrated financial markets, unilateral environmental policies are becoming less effective, because of the existence of policy spill-overs...|$|R
