40|$|This thesis was {{developed}} {{with the main}} objective to manufacture briquettes to improve the Urea application and to fill the necessity that the rice crops has. Nowadays, the Urea is spread over the rice plantations; this process causes a huge waste. Therefore the application of briquettes in this soils of rice crops is proposed. This will reduce the big amount of waste, so in this way, its consumption will be reduce. The briquettes will be manufactured by a briquette machine, that is the main objective of this thesis and it is detailed as continues. In order to start designing, first I searched for all the theoretical knowledge of the briquettes machine, then the materials {{that are going to}} be use into the briquettes and finally the main parameters to be used for starting design this machine. Then, I made the machine's design and each one of its components like: structure, alveolus cylinders, the feeding's hopper, etc; once designed the machine's shape, I proceed with the calculation of components such as: the straight teeth Gear, the alveolus cylinders, the cylinders shaft, etc. Also, with the calculations results, I proceed with the accessories selection; like the driving pulley, speed reducer pulley, V bands, bearings case, electrical motor, etc. These selections were carried out based on tables, mechanical pieces catalogues and the mine own experience, obtaining a final result. Then the blue print of the machine and the parts for its construction. Also, a construction program {{was developed}}. In this program I included a process work <b>plan</b> and a <b>GANTT</b> <b>plan.</b> Then according the cost, I made an estimated budget for the machine's construction. Considering, special attention for all accessories and materials that are available in the local market. Finally, I approach conclusions and recommendations about this work...|$|R
40|$|Software {{development}} projects require {{the translation of}} good abstract ideas into clear design specifications. Subsequent delivery of the software product in moderate-to-large scale projects requires effective project planning and assignments for a team of software engineers to meet deadlines {{in the presence of}} resource constraints. This paper explores the hypothesis that axiomatic design may be integrated into the process of project planning and task assignment for software development teams. An approach to mapping functional requirements and design parameters into tasks of a project <b>plan</b> <b>Gantt</b> chart is described. Effects of transferring the relationships of design matrices to task links are discussed. The result is considered by the authors to be a productive integration facilitating the rapid delivery of product by software engineering teams...|$|R

After three years of engineering education, the fourth year is devoted to a free-form project in which students must learn to manage from start to finish a full-scale engineering project. Students must either invent a new product, or add value to an existing product. Before the project starts, students complete a full patent search, and must pick a project which is different from any existing products. Students are required to give regular progress reports and must give between five and ten presentations per quarter, including seminar presentations on topics related to their projects. Accurate <b>Gantt</b> chart-type progress <b>plans</b> must be maintained alongside a full patent-ready documentation folder including an engineering notebook which must be dated, signed, and witnessed.|$|R
40|$|For decades, Army Engineers have {{utilized}} the {{systems of the}} Critical Path Method (CPM) and multi-level <b>Gantt</b> chart <b>planning</b> system for its construction projects. While these methods are well accepted, they are not without their flaws. Research and literature in project management has given weight to several viable alternative options to planning projects. One such option, Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM), was developed to address the flaws of CPM by offering a holistic approach to project management based on strict resource control {{and the use of}} time buffers. This method attempts to eliminate multitasking and procrastination that can plague efficiency and offer managers more flexibly on tasks that otherwise had no leeway. CCPM may give project managers more flexibility and control {{while at the same time}} shortening the overall length of a project, saving time and money. The purpose of this thesis was to address the time saving and resource management benefits of utilizing CCPM over CPM and analyze the viability of those benefits being applied to U. S. Army Corps of Engineers construction project planning. Through the use of surveys of Army Engineer project supervisors, several key factors that cause delays because of CPM were identified and rated. The validity of CCPM based solutions to the same issues were also assessed by Army project supervisors in the survey. Analysis of the survey results indicated that CCPM may offer solutions to major issues that Army project supervisors face...|$|R

This project has two aims: In one hand tries to determine the prognosis of corporate traf&# 64257;c for the airport in an average horizon of design following the indications of the pertinent aeronautical organisms. In the other, use the data obtained to project {{an extension of the}} currentterminalbuildingthatfollowful&# 64257;llingalltheaeronauticalrulesandthatitcanabsorb the new traf&# 64257;c, as well as place the of&# 64257;ces of the companies that operate in the building. Tocarryoutthe&# 64257;rstpoint, theprognosisandthepertinentdiagnostic, asearchofthemost extended methods for the forecast calculation is done. Then which is better for the horizon proposed is chosen and the projection is done. Once we have the results, following the percentages of use of the terminal, the new percentages of use expected for the future are calculated. We analyze if the current building will be able to house all the traf&# 64257;c, and we obtain that it is not, so we propose the extension. In the second part, the part of design of the extension, we analyse the two terrain options available. Once chosen the terrain, we project a smaller continuation of the current terminal. As now there are two terminals joined, we propose to do a separation of &# 64258;uxes to do even more exclusive the terminal, {{due to the fact that}} the passengers will use only the existent terminal, and the new will house new of&# 64257;ces where the companies and/or AENA will work. We then design the new spaces to ful&# 64257;l the new needs. Once done the design, we calculate the structure and the foundation. We opt for a metallic structure. Later on we calculate the cover. Also we calculate the closings because they ful&# 64257;l the thermal requirements. Finally we do the planning of the work with the use of <b>Gantt's</b> Diagram.

40|$|The {{water quality}} at the beachfront of Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, is {{currently}} insufficient {{to meet the}} Blue Flag standard, leading to health issues for the beach users. Since Durban can be recognised by its busy port and attractive beachfront, {{it is a major}} centre for tourism. This means that research on the source of this poor water quality and the distribution of the pollution along the beachfront is of major importance for Durban to remain an attractive destination. It is very important to emphasize that to tackle the water quality problem at source technical, social and management aspect need to be considered simultaneously. It is inevitable to have a positive outcome for this project without finding a properly working combination between a technical design, the organizational structure, waste management and social issues for example since implementing a first world solution in a third world country is unrealistic at the moment. The scope area of this project consists of some catchment areas with their outfalls (of the storm water drainage system through which rainfall flows) at the beachfront of Durban between the uMgeni River and the port of Durban. Hence, an investigation of these areas onshore and a data study on the rainfall and the principle of the first flush has been performed. The first flush plays a big role in this project, since it is expexted that the first flush contains 80 % of the total pollution load that enters the storm water system and hence the beachfront. The critical zones, those areas that are in urgent need of water quality improvement, are indicated by a technical analysis. Besides that a social and management analysis was carried out to identify the organisational structure of the eThekwini Municipality and present all social issues that help deteriorate the water quality and which can be disturbing when generating the final solution. Eventually, one critical zone, Addington Beach, has been elaborated on. A diversion chamber has been designed on a conceptual level that diverts almost all pollutants to the sewage system instead of the beachfront. Hence, it is expected that the sewage system and the waste water treatment plant are both capable of handling the additional volume of water due the implementation of this chamber. To increase the feasibility of this project a phasing plan has been written containing a responsibility chart and a <b>Gantt</b> chart. This <b>plan</b> has been based on both a project and process management approach...|$|R

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2011 Son yıllarda proje yönetimi iş yaşamının vazgeçilmezi haline gelmiştir. Proje yönetiminin öneminin artması ile proje yöneticiliği de çok önemli bir meslek dalı olmuştur. Astronomik rakamlarla yürütülen mega projelerde, işi takip eden şirket ya da kurumların işten kazançlı çıkmaması gibi bir durum elbette düşünülemez. Ancak maksimum kazanç ve kısa zamanda projenin planlaması ve yapılan tahminlerin proje ile örtüşmesi projeyi daha başarılı kılar. Dahası, ihalelere en optimum maliyet ve zamana dayalı teklif verebilmek ancak ve ancak önceden yapılmış doğru bir planlama ile mümkündür. Planlama, proje yönetiminin temelini oluşturan bir unsurdur. Planlamada öncelikle yapılacak işler belirlenir, tanıtılır, işlemler adım adım sıraya konulur ve gerekli metaryeller saptanır. Proje yönetiminde her şey planlanabilir; süre, maliyet, kalite, üretim… vb. Özellikle, proje yönetiminde süre planlaması ve buna bağlı olarak ortaya çıkacak minimum maliyet konuları üzerinde durulmaktadır. Süre planlamasında önemli olan işlemlerin yapılma sürelerinin ya tecrübeye bağlı olarak yapılan kesin çıkarımlarla ya da tahminlerle ortaya konulması, sıralanması ve çakışan işlemlerin belirlenmesidir. Süresel planlamada birçok metod ortaya konmuştur. Bunun ilki ve en eskisi Gantt Diyagramı’ dır. Bu metod basit işlemler için ideal bir metodtur, ayrıca karmaşık işlemlerde ve diyagrama ya da programa yeni eklemeler yapıldığında oldukça hantal bir metod olduğundan çalışmaların hepsini ya da bir kısmını baştan almak gerekebilir. İkinci ve yine eski bir süresel planlama yöntemi devre metodudur ve bu yöntem de tercih edilen bir yöntem değildir. En yaygın planlama yöntemleri CPM ve PERT metodlarıdır. Burada CPM kesin çıkarımlara, PERT de birtakım tahminlere dayanır, bu iki yöntem birbiri ile ilişkili olduğundan bir arada kullanılabilir. Bu yöntemlerin kullanımı gerek zamanlama ve gerekse maliyet planlaması açısından oldukça avantajlıdır ve hantal yöntemler değildirler. Hata oranları da nispeten yok denilecek kadar küçüktür. Harita üretim sektörü açısından düşünüldüğünde CPM ve PERT yöntemleri en uygun yöntemlerdir, çünkü harita projelerinde de birtakım olasılık ve parametre tahminleri söz konusudur. Mevcut tez çalışmasında, Yalova Hacımehmed- 1 mevkiinde yapılacak 3194 / 18. madde uygulaması projesine ait veriler derlenerek CPM ve PERT metodları kullanılarak süre planlaması yapılması ve en düşük maliyet hesaplanması üzerine bir çalışma gerçekleştirilmiştir. Bu tez çalışmasının amacı, projelerde bu başarıyı elde etmek adına proje planlama ve yönetimini irdeleyerek geomatik mühendisliğinde uygulanışının bir avantaj sağlayacağını göstermektir. Project {{management}} {{is the art}} of coordinating human and sources throughout the life of a project by using modern management techniques to achieve predetermined objectives of scope, cost, time, quality and participation satisfaction. Project {{management is}} a systematic proces used to initiate, plan, execute, control and close a project to meet defined objectives. The science and art of project management provides a roadmap for efficient and successful project completion. Project planning is part of project management, which relates to the use of schedules such as <b>Gantt</b> charts to <b>plan</b> and subsequently report progress within the project environment. Project management has been the most important step in business life nowadays. The job which is called as project manager is getting popular by increasing importance of the project management. A project is successful when the needs of the stakeholders have been met. A stakeholder is anybody directly or indirectly impacted by the project. As a first step, it is important to identify the stakeholders in the project. It is not always easy to identify the stakeholders of a project, particularly those impacted indirectly. The science and art of project management provides a proven methodology for accurate and efficient project complement of any size. Thorough and detailed project planning results in a bought-into, approved, realistic, and formalized project plan. Such careful planning saves time and money by proactively addressing risks before they occur, as well as by eliminating the need for changes late in the project. Studies have shown that changes made late in a project could cost up to 100 times as much as if they were made early in project planning. The projects which is called as mega projects are finished by huge amount of money. In those projects project management should be used for more succes. The another important issue is the time of the projects. The time which is between the beginnin {{and the end of the}} project is called project time. In addition, if the project time is as short as possible, the project cost will be decrease. So, the money which is earned from the project will be more. Furthermore, the success of such projects is important for the companies. If the companies have a good project management plan, being unsuccesful is impossible. A project can not be thought without a planning technique of project management. The projects without a plan are always unsuccessful. If a project has a good plan, the predictions will be almost the same as the real. Those predictions are about the time, sources, staff and cost. Depends on time predictions, project manager will decide the beginning, the end and empty time of the project. Also, the cost prediction of the project gives an opportunity of finding the money which is earned from that project. When companies recognize the need to begin developing processes for project management, the starting point is normally the stage-gate process. The stages are managed by cross-functional teams. The gates are structured decision points at the end of each stage. In a good project management, project team focuses too much attention on prepearing for the gate reviews rather than on the actual management of the project. Project management is used to manage the stages between the gates and shorten the time between the gates. That is a critical success factor if the stage-gate process is to be used fort he development and new products. A perfect methodology for project management will provide checklists, forms and guidelines to make sure that critical steps are not omitted. The approximate total cost of the project is determined, a cost-benefit analysis should be made to determine if the estimated value of the information which is obtained. That analysis is included as part of a feasibility study. The project manager is a profession of project management. Project managers may have the responsibility of the project planning relating to construction industry, engineering, architecture and communication techniques. A project manager is the person who creates clear and attainable project objectives showing the project requirements. The project manager aims to create an atmosphere of a cooperative and effective team. A successful Project Manager must effectively manage the resources assigned to the project. That includes the labor hours of the designers, the builders, the testers and the inspectors on the project team. It also include managing any labor subcontracts. However, managing project resources frequently involves more than people management. The project manager must also manage the equipment used for the project and the material needed by the people and equipment assigned to the project. Project management is developed from civil construction and engineering. The father of planning and control of the projects is called Hanry Gantt, who is the Gantt Chart as a project management tool. The another forefather of project management is Hanry Fayol. Both Gantt and Fayol were students of Frederick Winslow Taylor’s Theories Of Scientific Management. In the United States, from the beginning 1950 s, Gantt Charts and other informal techniques were using but after, two mathematical project-scheduling models were developed. The (CPM) ‘‘Critical Path Method’’ was developed from Du Pont Corporation and Remington Rand Corporation for managing plan maintenance projects. The ‘‘Program Evaluation and Review Technique’’ or PERT was developed by Hamilton as a part of a submarine program of USA Navy which is called Polaris. The project planning is a part of project management which is for schedules such as Gantt Charts. Firstly, the project scope should be defined and planning methods for completing the project will be determined. After, the logical dependencies between tasks are defined using a diagram which is giving the total cost of the project. The progress of the project will be analized against the baseline throughout the life of the project. Analyzing progress compared to the baseline is known as earned value management. For management of activities and a project schedule, developing procedures involve giving a detailed schedule at the project definition stage. There are a range of project management techniques which are used to track time and manage resources in a project. When the scope of the project is defined, the project manager with the help of the client requirements capture team proposes the budget and the recources in the project at the beginning of the project. There are lots of different planning types such as time planning, source planning, quality planning, staff planning… etc. Time management encompasses the work required to create realistic time estimates, andultimately an approved schedule for the completion of project activities in the most timely manner possible. It also involves managing the project to ensure adherence to the schedule. Cost management encompasses the work required to create realistic cost estimates, and ultimately an approved budget for the completion of project activities in the most cost effective manner possible. It also involves managing the project to ensure adherence to the budget. No one is happy when work exceeds the budget allocated for it, which is why creating a realistic budget is imperative. In that thesis project we insist on time planning in project management. There are time planning methods such as Gantt Diagrams, PERT and CPM Methods. Gantt Diagrams are widely used in Millitary Applications. Althought, Gantt is a classical method. CPM and PERT Methods are new, usable and widely used methods. Any change in the diagrams of CPM and PERT methods are really easy. These methods are arranged by time intervals of works in the projects. Depends of that time plan, the source plan should be made. Furthermore, a project that is about reconstruction aplication was planned by CPM and PERT methods and I have showed the advanteges and disadvanteges of these methods. That project consists of the application of CPM and PERT Methods about 3194 / 18. artical of the reconstruction law. Aplication of Yalova Hacı Mehmet- 1 Region. Microsoft Office Project Manager is a program which is used for project management and that program has been used for ‘‘Project Management and Planning In Geomatics Engineering’’ project. At the begining of the application, the works are selected and the time intervals for each application are predicted depends on knowledge of the previous projects. Then, the works, the time and critical works are entered into the programme. After that, Gantt Diagram of the project is drawn and CPM Diagram is drawn. Anyway, CPM showed us the beginning and the end of the project and also, the time intervals of each work of the project. Also, it gives an a opportunity of management of the time depends on CPM method. That time management is a programme of cost plan, the cost plan is for both the source management and prediction of the money which is earned from the project. Project management provides significant benefits to companies and to managers when the principles and methodologies are consistently applied. First, project management helps managers identify ill-conceived and directionless projects. After, project management promotes teamwork and communication across departments. Also, project management enables managers to predict costs and make more informed decisions. Shortly, the science and art of project management provides a roadmap for perfect andmore and more successful project completion. Project planning is the most important part of project management, which relates to the use of schedules and report progress within the project environment. Projects can not be successful without using project management techniques. Those techniques are for the perfect plan of each project. As I showed, in that project CPM Technique gives an important opportunity for time and cost planning and cost management is around the work required to create realistic cost predictions, and ultimately an approved budget for the completion of project activities in the most cost effective manner possible. Anyway, projects can not be thought without a good management plan and a project manager. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R
