5000|$|Learning styles also impact {{business}} {{education in}} the classroom. Kolb transposes four learning styles, <b>Diverger,</b> Assimilator, Accommodator [...] and Converger, atop the Experiential Learning Model, using the four experiential learning stages to carve out [...] "four quadrants", one for each learning style. An individual’s dominant learning style can be identified by taking Kolb’s Learning Style Inventory (LSI). Robert Loo (2002) undertook a meta-analysis of 8 studies which revealed that Kolb’s learning styles were not equally distributed among business majors in the sample. More specifically, results indicated that {{there appears to be}} a high proportion of assimilators and a lower proportion of accommodators than expected for business majors. Not surprisingly, within the accounting sub-sample there was a higher proportion of convergers and a lower proportion of accommodates. Similarly, in the finance sub-sample, a higher proportion of assimilators and lower proportion of divergers was apparent. Within the marketing sub-sample there was an equal distribution of styles. This would provide some evidence to suggest that while it is useful for educators to be aware of common learning styles within business and accounting programs, they should be encouraging students to use all four learning styles appropriately and students should use a wide range of learning methods.|$|E

In this study, the participants (n= 80) are grouped to the LS of <b>Diverger,</b> Assimilator, Converger or Accommodator using the Kolb's Learning Style Inventory (KLSI). Subsequently, their brain signals were then recorded using EEG at resting baseline state of Open Eyes and Closed Eyes. A statistical tool of SPSS 16 was used for data analysis purposes. Using the Two Step Cluster analysis, the participants’ EEG datasets were 100 % classified to the corresponding LS. Then, EEG Alpha band was selected to link between LS, IQ and Stress.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} whether a relationship existed between student learning styles and their preferences toward the various activities associated with the Problem-Based Learning (PBL) approach in the first-year pharmacy curriculum at the University of British Columbia. These PBL activities comprise group discussions, independent research, in-class critical-thinking and group report writing. In the fall semester of the 2000 - 2001 academic year, first-year pharmacy students completed Kolb's Learning Styles Inventory. Student preferences toward the various activities associated with the PBL tutorials were evaluated based upon the results of student surveys. Results from these surveys revealed that <b>Divergers</b> indicated the lowest preference overall for the activities associated with the PBL program in the first-year pharmacy curriculum compared to the other three learning style groups. Convergers showed strong preferences for these activities. While the Convergers and <b>Divergers</b> indicated opposing preferences overall for the activities associated with the PBL, the Assimilators and Accommodators indicated overall positive responses to the PBL activities. These findings may be used in future studies to evaluate whether student preferences for certain learning environments are correlated to their academic success as measured by grades...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the association between adult learners' preferred learning style and preference for delivery mode. The subjects (n= 61) were technical and billing support call center employees from an Internet company in Dallas, Texas. The participants were randomly assigned to one of six groups and given Kolb's Learning Style Inventory to assess their preference for learning style. They received training on three modules of &# 8220;Influencing Others Positively,&# 8221; with each module delivered via one of three methods (web-based, classroom, and blended). Participants were also administered two surveys. The first survey collected demographic information and asked which method that they expected they would prefer. The second survey was administered after the course and asked them to rank their preferences for delivery method. It was hypothesized that learning style would be significantly associated with preference for delivery method. The data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and a chi-square test of independence for the variables learning style and preferred mode of delivery. Although the chi-square test of independence did not produce statistical significance, some interesting trends were identified in the data. Specifically, a majority of the participants preferred a blended approach to training delivery (a combination of self-paced web-based training and classroom group exercises). No <b>Divergers</b> preferred classroom training and no Accommodators preferred web-based training. Additionally, a logistic regression analysis indicated that Assimilators were six times more likely than <b>Divergers</b> to prefer a blended approach to training (p=. 10). Further studies should utilize other learning style theories, explore different types of learning outcomes and delivery methods, and include a larger sample from different organizations.

40|$|Background: Most {{students}} {{admitted to}} medical school are abstract-passive learners. However, as they progress through the program, active learning and concrete interpersonal interactions become crucial for the acquisition of professional competencies. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine if and how medical students' learning styles change during the course of their undergraduate program. Methods: All students admitted to the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile (PUC) medical school between 2000 and 2011 (n = 1, 290) took the Kolb’s Learning Style Inventory at school entrance. Two years later 627 students took it again, and in the seventh and last year of the program 104 students took it for a third time. The distribution of styles at years 1, 3 and 7, and the mobility of students between styles were analyzed with Bayesian models. Results: Most freshmen (54 %) were classified as assimilators (abstract-passive learners); convergers (abstract-active) followed with 26 %, whereas <b>divergers</b> (concrete-passive) and accommodators (concrete-active) accounted for 11 % and 9 %, respectively. By year 3, the styles' distribution remained unchanged but in year 7 convergers outnumbered assimilators (49 % vs. 33 %). In general, there were no gender-related differences.
