[...] In an attempt to accomplish both of these at once, he offered his collection of negatives to the Nebraska State Historical Society. [...] To Addison Sheldon, head of the Society's Legislative Reference Bureau, he wrote, [...] "Now {{is the time to}} buy me cheap, when <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>the</b> money so badly." [...] In November 1911, he and Sheldon signed a contract for the sale of the negatives for $1000. [...] Butcher was to receive $100 down; the rest would be paid after the Nebraska legislature passed a bill appropriating funds for the purchase.|$|E

2500|$|On March 31, 2004, the United States {{closed its}} Roosevelt Roads Naval Station on {{mainland}} Puerto Rico. A skeleton staff of 200, down from approximately 1,200 civilian and 700 military personnel, stayed {{on at the}} facility until {{the transfer of the}} property was completed. The closure of the base at Roosevelt Roads resulted in a substantial financial loss to the economy of Puerto Rico that the Navy estimates at $250 to $300 million a year. Admiral Robert J. Natter, commander of the Atlantic Fleet, is on record as saying: [...] "Without Vieques there is no way <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>the</b> Navy facilities at Roosevelt Roads — none.

We're not trying to replace Layne. We want to play these songs one more time, and if it seems like the right thing to do, it'll happen. I don't know how long it will go or where it will take us.

2500|$|Voelker's {{business}} slowed {{after the}} Peterson trial, and by 1953 {{he closed his}} office and worked from home. In 1954, {{he ran for the}} United States Congress. In 1956, he was interviewed as a possible candidate to fill a vacancy on the Michigan Supreme Court. At the time, Governor G. Mennen Williams thought it was appropriate to revive a tradition of having a justice from the Upper Peninsula on the court. When asked why he wanted to serve, Voelker replied, [...] "Because I have spent my life on fiction and fishing, and <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>the</b> money." [...] He was appointed the 74th justice of the Michigan Supreme Court by [...] Williams to fill Emerson R. Boyles's vacant seat on the court in December 1956, and Voelker was confirmed in an election in 1957 to fill out the remainder of Boyles' term. He was then reelected to a full term in 1958.|$|E
2500|$|Wilson is {{afflicted with}} {{schizoaffective}} disorder that presents {{itself in the}} form of disembodied voices (auditory hallucinations). The illness emerged a week after his first LSD consumption. It formed a major component of Bill Pohlad's Love & Mercy (2014), a biographical film which depicts Wilson's hallucinations as a source of musical inspiration, constructing songs that were partly designed to converse with them. Wilson has said of the voices: [...] "Mostly [...] derogatory. Some of it's cheerful. Most of it isn't." [...] He added that his hallucinations will inspire a song [...] "every now and then". In 2002, Wilson felt that his successful treatment initiated a writer's block: [...] "I haven't been able to write anything for three years. I think <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>the</b> demons in order to write, but the demons have gone. It bothers me a lot. I've tried and tried, but I just can't seem to find a melody." ...|$|E

She said, [...] "I had doubts to begin with, mainly because of Kiki, as I know how full-on EastEnders can be, and then there's that stigma {{about going back to}} a soap. But I'm so pleased I did, it was the right decision. Especially with what's going on at the moment, I feel really lucky to have a job and <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>the</b> security because of Kiki. I was just going to go back for a year, but I had a meeting with the boss last week and we're going to go for another year. So lots more time to get up to much mischief". Executive producer Diederick Santer said, [...] "I couldn't be more pleased that Charlie Brooks is re-joining EastEnders. With her appearances last month, she reminded us what a fine actress she is, and what an intriguing, watchable and engaging character she plays as Janine". She temporarily departed in September 2012, and returned in April 2013 before departing again in March 2014.|$|E

2500|$|When Ament {{became aware}} of the {{criticism}} of his activities and the subsequent controversy, he was affected adversely. Ament admitted the strain {{in a letter to his}} wife on Sunday, 27 January 1901: [...] "I am doing what I do not recall that I ever did before, remaining at home deliberately and missing all the services. <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>the</b> rest and felt that it was imperative. You see there is no let up for me. It is a constant strain from morning till night." [...] Missionary colleague Miss Nellie Naomi Russell (born Ontonagon, Michigan, 31 March 1862; died 22 August 1911 in China) records: ...when he was weary in body and mind, there came like a thunderbolt the article by Mark Twain in the North American Review. I remember that day I went to his study on a matter of business, and found him sitting at his desk as if stricken at the heart. I exclaimed, [...] "What is it? Are you ill?" [...] "If I am what that man says, I am not fit for you to speak to me ! I feel as though I should go off and hide myself in a cave in the mountain, never again to be seen of man." [...] I thought he had gone out of his head with all his cares, and I replied, [...] " [...] What you need is rest and a doctor, and I am going to send for one." [...] If the writer of that article could have seen how he suffered he would have felt that every cent he received for that article would be a red hot coal of fire. A brave, masterful man he was, ever ready to relieve, not to add to the sum of human suffering, and while in some things he may have been unwise, his mistakes, whatever they may have been, were of the head and not the heart.|$|E
