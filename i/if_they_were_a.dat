5|$|Several {{more recent}} studies have raised the {{possibility}} that the dinosaur was omnivorous and used its tusks for prey killing during an occasional hunt. In 2000, Paul Barrett suggested that the shape of the premaxillary teeth and the fine serration of the tusks are reminiscent of carnivorous animals, hinting at facultative carnivory. Muntjacs, in contrast, lack serration on their tusks. In 2008, Butler and colleagues argued that the enlarged tusks formed early {{in the development of the}} individual, and therefore could not constitute sexual dimorphism. Combat with conspecifics thus is an unlikely function, as enlarged tusks would be expected only in males <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> tool for combat. Instead, feeding or defence functions are more likely. It has also been suggested that Heterodontosaurus could have used its jugal bosses to deliver blows during combat, and that the palpebral bone could have protected the eyes against such attacks. In 2011, Norman and colleagues drew attention to the arms and hands, which are relatively long and equipped with large, recurved claws. These features, in combination with the long hindlimbs that allowed for fast running, would have made the animal capable of seizing small prey. As an omnivore, Heterodontosaurus would have had a significant selection advantage during the dry season when vegetation was scarce.|$|E

Instead, the ICTY indicted some Bosnian Army commanders on the basis of superior criminal responsibility. The ICTY acquitted Amir Kubura and Enver Hadžihasanović of the Bosnian 3rd Corps of all charges related to the incidents involving mujahideen. Furthermore, the Appeals Chamber noted that the relationship between the 3rd Corps and the El Mujahedin detachment was not one of subordination but was instead close to overt hostility since the only way to control the detachment was to attack them as <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> distinct enemy force.|$|E

[...] Hubbard is presented as [...] "the master of a multitude of disciplines" [...] who performed extraordinary feats as a photographer, composer, scientist, therapist, explorer, navigator, philosopher, poet, artist, humanitarian, adventurer, soldier, scout, musician and many other fields of endeavor. The Church of Scientology portrays Hubbard's life and work as having proceeded seamlessly, [...] "as <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> continuous set of predetermined events and discoveries that unfolded through his lifelong research" [...] even up to and beyond his death.|$|E

500|$|Auden's clipped, satiric, and ironic {{style in}} the 1930s was widely imitated by younger poets such as Charles Madge, who wrote in a poem [...] "there waited {{for me in the}} summer morning / Auden fiercely.

[...] Auden's propagandistic poetic plays, including The Dog Beneath the Skin and The Ascent of F6, and his political poems such as [...] "Spain" [...] gave him the reputation as a political poet writing in a progressive and accessible voice, in contrast to Eliot; but this political stance provoked opposing opinions, such as that of Austin Clarke who called Auden's work [...] "liberal, democratic, and humane", and John Drummond, who wrote that Auden misused a [...] "characteristic and popularizing trick, the generalized image", to present ostensibly left-wing views that were in fact [...] "confined to bourgeois experience." ...|$|E
500|$|Todd was {{a pioneer}} doctor {{in the field of}} psychiatry. [...] At the time, {{treatment}} of the mentally ill was typically inhumane: “A mentally ill patient was locked up in an insane asylum with little or no care and treated as <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> criminal”. Prior to 1800, it was common for people deemed mad to be locked away and forgotten about. Some individuals, such as Todd and Dorothea Dix wanted more humane care for the mentally ill as they were appalled at the treatment of such people. The Connecticut Retreat for the Insane was built in 1823, and was opened to admissions in 1824. Eli Todd was its first director. It was {{often referred to as the}} Hartford Retreat for the Insane, and is now known as The Institute of Living. The Hartford Retreat for the Insane cost $12,000 to build and could serve up to 40 patients at a time. “It cost $3.00 a week for a state resident and $4.00 a week for an out of state resident”.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Rich Girl" [...] was {{directed}} by David LaChapelle and features a pirate theme. The video, inspired by an early-1980s Vivienne Westwood advertising campaign, opens with four Japanese schoolgirls playing with a toy pirate ship and two Bratz dolls of Stefani and Eve, while the girls discuss {{what they would do}} <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> [...] "rich girl". The video features several sequences. Stefani is first shown below the deck of a pirate ship, dancing on a table and singing to the song. She is surrounded by pirates and [...] and is soon joined by Eve, wearing an eyepatch. In the surreal style of LaChapelle, the pirate crew has distorted features, and a leaked casting call commented, [...] "I need the freaks on this one." [...] Above deck Stefani, the Harajuku Girls, Eve, and more pirates dance on the deck and rigging. Stefani is also seen dancing with the Harajuku Girls in a treasure trove, often carrying a sword, and swinging from an anchor. When the girls dunk the toy ship in a fish tank, the galleon engages in cannon fire, causing Stefani and the pirates to fall all over the ship, and Stefani and the Harajuku Girls are soon shipwrecked.|$|E
500|$|While {{many economists}} and tax experts support a {{consumption}} tax, problems could arise with using a retail sales tax {{rather than a}} value added tax (VAT). [...] A VAT imposes a tax on the value added at every intermediate step of production, so the goods reach the final consumer {{with much of the}} tax already in the price. The retail seller has little incentive to conceal retail sales, since he has already paid much of the good's tax. Retailers are unlikely to subsidize the consumer's tax evasion by concealing sales. In contrast, a retailer has paid no tax on goods under a sales tax system. This provides an incentive for retailers to conceal sales and engage in [...] "tax arbitrage" [...] by sharing some of the illicit tax savings with the final consumer. [...] Citing evasion, Tim Worstall wrote in Forbes that Europe’s 20-25% consumption taxes simply would not work <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> sales tax: that’s why they’re all a VAT. [...] Laurence Kotlikoff has stated that the government could compel firms to report, via 1099-type forms, their sales to other firms, which would provide the same records that arise under a VAT. [...] In the United States, a general sales tax is imposed in 45 states plus the District of Columbia (accounting for over 97% of both population and economic output), which proponents argue provides a large infrastructure for taxing sales that many countries do not have.|$|E
500|$|The album's title, Nimrod, is {{the name}} of a {{character}} from the Bible that in American English became a term for a stupid or dimwitted person. After three art directors were rejected by the band and pressing was behind schedule, Green Day asked the help of Chris Bilheimer, a friend of Armstrong who had done covers for another group signed by Warner Bros. Records, R.E.M. Having just the album title to work on, Bilheimer had some ideas, with the one that went through being inspired by a photograph Bilheimer saw, where a politician’s poster had had his face removed. He felt the image was [...] "striking" [...] and seemed to fit the band by featuring [...] "a typical middle-age male, corporate politician American kind of guy, and someone had completely taken his identity away through vandalism." [...] Following that line of thought, Bilheimer took an encyclopedia picture of men in suits and ties and put colored circles reading [...] "nimrod." [...] on their faces, [...] "using that to take away the people's identity". The back cover had the same being done to a yearbook Bilheimer found in a Los Angeles bookstore, [...] "from the era of the Leave it to Beaver 1950's idyllic America", with the label [...] "break down that image of people’s perceptions of a happy polite idyllic society."
