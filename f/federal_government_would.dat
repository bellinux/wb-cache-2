Senior nursing students were required to work for a six-month period in a federal or non-federal hospital, or in other health agency. In return, the <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>would</b> pay the schools for the related tuition and fees of the students.|$|E
5|$|In 1803 Harrison asked Congress {{to suspend}} the anti-slavery clause of the Northwest Ordinance for ten years. Harrison claimed it was {{necessary}} to increase the territory's population more quickly and attract new settlers. Congress wanted the territory to become economically viable so that the <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>would</b> not longer have to financially support it. In 1803 the entire territory's population numbered less than 5,000. That year the legislature—which was appointed by Harrison—passed legislation reintroducing indentured servitude.|$|E
5|$|In his Federalist No. 43, {{published}} January 23, 1788, James Madison {{argued that}} the new <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>would</b> need authority over a national capital to provide for its own maintenance and safety. Five years earlier, a band of unpaid soldiers besieged Congress while its members were meeting in Philadelphia. Known as the Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783, the event emphasized {{the need for the}} national government not to rely on any state for its own security.|$|E

25|$|Though the Charter itself {{came into}} effect on April 17, 1982, section 15 was not brought into force until April 17, 1985, in {{accordance}} with section 32(2) of the Charter.

5|$|During the transition, many {{or most of}} the {{employees}} of the IRS (105,978 in 2005) would face loss of employment. The Beacon Hill Institute estimate is that the <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>would</b> be able to cut $8 billion from the IRS budget of $11.01 billion (in 2007), reducing the size of federal tax administration by 73%. In addition, income tax preparers (many seasonal), tax lawyers, tax compliance staff in medium-to-large businesses, and software companies which sell tax preparation software could face significant drops, changes, or loss of employment. The bill would maintain the IRS for three years after implementation before completely decommissioning the agency, providing employees time to find other employment.|$|E
5|$|The cent was {{the first}} {{official}} United States coin to be struck at the Philadelphia Mint in 1793. These pieces, today known as large cents, were made of pure copper and were {{about the size of}} a half dollar. They were struck every year, except 1815 due to a shortage of metal, but were slow to become established in commerce. Worn Spanish colonial silver pieces were then commonly used as money throughout the United States. At the time, both gold and silver were legal tender there, but copper coins were not; the <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>would</b> not redeem them or take them in payment of taxes.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{feud with}} Rivadavia, who was {{appointed}} President of Argentina, San Martín offered his military services in the War with Brazil, but received no response. He sailed to the country when Rivadavia was deposed and replaced by the federal Manuel Dorrego, and the war ended in the interim. He intended to return anyway, as a <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>would</b> spare him the persecution he would otherwise have received from the unitarians. He was unable to do as he planned. When his ship docked in Río de Janeiro he was informed that the unitarian Juan Lavalle had deposed Dorrego, and when he reached Montevideo he was informed that Lavalle had captured and executed Dorrego and begun a campaign of terror against all federals in the country. The ship arrived in Buenos Aires, but San Martín did not leave it, instead returning to Montevideo. Lavalle was unable {{to put down the}} federal rebellion against him, and offered San Martín the government. San Martín declined and returned to Brussels.|$|E

50|$|During {{the same}} {{legislative}} session, Cline introduced legislation to permit greater tax incentives {{for those who}} donate money to the health-care system (SSP, 22 May 1996). In August 1996, he announced that the provincial and <b>federal</b> <b>governments</b> <b>would</b> cooperate to construct a new Athabasca health facility in northern Saskatchewan (SSP, 14 August 1996). Later in the year, after accusations of underfunding by the Saskatchewan Nurses Union, Cline and the Romanow government introduced an additional $40 million for the provincial health system (SSP, 22 August 1996).|$|R
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, the United States {{government}} {{attempted to}} weaken hurricanes through Project Stormfury by seeding selected storms with silver iodide. It {{was thought that}} the seeding would cause supercooled water in the outer rainbands to freeze, causing the inner eyewall to collapse and thus reducing the winds. The winds of Hurricane Debbie—a hurricane seeded in Project Stormfury—dropped as much as 31%, but Debbie regained its strength after each of two seeding forays. In an earlier episode in 1947, disaster struck when a hurricane east of Jacksonville, Florida promptly changed its course after being seeded, and smashed into Savannah, Georgia. Because {{there was so much}} uncertainty about the behavior of these storms, the <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>would</b> not approve seeding operations unless the hurricane had a less than 10% chance of making landfall within 48 hours, greatly reducing the number of possible test storms. The project was dropped after it was discovered that eyewall replacement cycles occur naturally in strong hurricanes, casting doubt on the result of the earlier attempts. Today, it is known that silver iodide seeding is not likely to have an effect because the amount of supercooled water in the rainbands of a tropical cyclone is too low.|$|E
5|$|Other {{accounts}} {{describe the}} indictment of 24 men for high treason. Most of the accused had eluded capture, so only ten men stood trial for treason in federal court. Of these, only Philip Wigle and John Mitchell were convicted. Wigle had beaten up a tax collector and burned his house; Mitchell was a simpleton who had been convinced by David Bradford to rob the U.S. mail. Both men were sentenced to death by hanging, but they were pardoned by President Washington. Pennsylvania state courts were more successful in prosecuting lawbreakers, securing numerous convictions for assault and rioting. While violent opposition to the whiskey tax ended, political opposition to the tax continued. Opponents of internal taxes rallied around the candidacy of Thomas Jefferson and helped him defeat President John Adams in the election of 1800. By 1802, Congress repealed the distilled spirits excise tax and all other internal Federal taxes. Until the War of 1812, the <b>Federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>would</b> rely solely on import tariffs for revenue, which quickly grew with the Nation's expanding foreign trade.|$|E
5|$|The State of Illinois {{wanted a}} {{commemorative}} coin {{to be issued}} for the centennial of its 1818 admission to the Union. A bill that would accomplish this, H.R. 8764, was introduced into the U.S. House of Representatives on January 16, 1918 by that state's Loren E. Wheeler. It was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures, which held hearings on March 5. Wheeler told the committee (of which {{he was not a}} member) that the coins were desired for distribution during the celebrations in Illinois. He had been to see Treasury Secretary William G. McAdoo and Mint Director Raymond T. Baker. Neither had any objection to the legislation, though McAdoo had explained that the problem with commemorative coins was that they did not sell as well as expected, and many were returned to the Mint for melting. After telling of his meeting with the officials, Wheeler explained to the committee that the coins would be purchased by the State Treasurer of Illinois and so there would be no returns. James L. Slayden of Texas asked what the cost to the <b>federal</b> <b>government</b> <b>would</b> be, but Wheeler did not know. Slayden asked what had been the cost for the 1916–1917 McKinley Birthplace Memorial dollar, and Ohio's William A. Ashbrook, the chairman of the committee, said that the cost of the dies had been borne by the group purchasing the coins from the government; Ashbrook proposed amending the bill to make this clear this would be an expense to be paid by Illinois. Wheeler had no objection, and stated that to avoid returns, it might be best if the issue was limited to 100,000 coins rather than the 200,000 in the original bill. Ashbrook then asked if the coins were to be sold at a premium by the centennial committee, and Wheeler denied this, indicating that they were to be circulated like any other half dollar. This concluded the public hearing on the bill, with the committee to take further action in executive session.|$|E
