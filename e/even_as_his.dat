25|$|From {{the mid-1950s}} to the mid-1960s, Hughes' {{popularity}} among {{the younger generation}} of black writers varied <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> reputation increased worldwide. With the gradual advancement toward racial integration, many black writers considered his writings of black pride and its corresponding subject matter out of date. They considered him a racial chauvinist. He found some new writers, among them James Baldwin, lacking in such pride, over-intellectual in their work, and occasionally vulgar.|$|E
25|$|His own {{far left}} inclinations were by then {{contrasting}} with his civil service positions, which he maintained <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> daughter Ecaterina {{was becoming a}} persona non grata. In 1923, Arbore published a new installment of his memoirs, as În temnițele rusești ("In the Russian Dungeons"). In March 1924, he replaced Vasile Ghenzul as editorial director of Furnica ("The Ant"). The cooperativist and agrarian bimonthly was published in Bessarabia, and printed a Russian-language supplement. He was still {{a contributor to the}} central leftist press: in December 1926, Adevărul published his piece about the Serbian politician Nikola Pašić, defunct leader of the People's Radical Party. During this interval, Ecaterina tried to return to Romania. According to one interpretation, she was trying to hide her growing disillusionment with communism under the pretext that she needed {{to take care of her}} ailing father. The Romanian authorities did not allow her entry into the country, and she was forced back. Zamfir and his wife had earlier adopted Dumitru's young child, Zamfir Dumitru Arbore.|$|E
25|$|In interviews, Zevon {{described}} a lifelong phobia {{of doctors and}} said he seldom received medical assessment. Shortly before playing at the Edmonton Folk Music Festival in 2002, he started feeling dizzy and developed a chronic cough. After a period of suffering with pain and shortness of breath, Zevon was encouraged by his dentist to see a physician; {{he was diagnosed with}} pleural mesothelioma, a cancer that affects the pleura, a thin membrane around the lungs and chest lining. Although Zevon never revealed where he may have been exposed to asbestos, his son, Jordan, suggests that it came from Zevon's childhood, playing in the attic of his father's carpet store in Arizona. Refusing treatments he believed might incapacitate him, Zevon instead began recording his final album, The Wind, which includes performances by close friends including Bruce Springsteen, Don Henley, Jackson Browne, Timothy B. Schmit, Joe Walsh, David Lindley, Billy Bob Thornton, Emmylou Harris, Tom Petty, Dwight Yoakam, and others.

Chadbourne wrote that [...] "the arrogance of 'I'm Bad' [...] was perfectly trumped by Yankovic's musical pile of lard, the appeal of the video's visuals clearly not the only ace in the hole."

500|$|Now on foot, {{the knights}} drew swords and {{returned}} to battle, Le Gris again proving stronger than his opponent and slowly gaining the upper hand. After several minutes of engagement, Carrouges slipped and Le Gris was able to stab his rival through the right thigh. As the crowd gasped and murmured, Le Gris stepped back to view his opponent's injury and Carrouges desperately counter-attacked, wrestling Le Gris to the ground. Le Gris' heavy armour prevented him from regaining his feet and Carrouges repeatedly stabbed at his floored opponent, his blows denting but not puncturing the thick plate steel. Realising that his sword was inadequate, Carrouges straddled Le Gris and used the handle of his dagger to smash the lock holding Le Gris' faceplate in position. <b>Even</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> opponent struggled beneath him, Carrouges tore the plate off and demanded that Le Gris admit his guilt. Le Gris refused and cried out [...] "In the name of God and on the peril and damnation of my soul, I am innocent".

[...] He was awed by the reaction he received from fans in Calgary however; fans greeted him warmly <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> flight landed to arrive in the city. Mullen described the experience as being [...] "almost like ... an instant celebrity". He quickly established himself as a fan favorite, scoring 38 points in 29 games to end the regular season. He then led the league with 12 goals in the 1986 Stanley Cup Playoffs. The Flames reached the final for the first time in franchise history, but lost to the Montreal Canadiens in five games. [...] Mullen set a personal best of 47 goals in his first full year in Calgary, 1986–87, and with only 14 penalty minutes on the season, was voted the winner of the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy as the NHL's most gentlemanly player.|$|E
500|$|Boulton helped {{deal with}} the {{shortage}} of silver, persuading the Government to let him overstrike the Bank of England's large stock of Spanish dollars with an English design. [...] The Bank had attempted to circulate the dollars by countermarking the coins on the side showing the Spanish king with a small image of George III, but the public was reluctant to accept them, {{in part due to}} counterfeiting. This attempt inspired the couplet, [...] "The Bank to make their Spanish Dollars pass/Stamped the head of a fool on the neck of an ass." [...] Boulton obliterated the old design in his restriking. Though Boulton was not as successful in defeating counterfeiters as he hoped (high quality fakes arrived at the Bank's offices within days of the issuance), these coins circulated until the Royal Mint again struck large quantities of silver coin in 1816, when Boulton's were withdrawn. He oversaw the final issue of his coppers for Britain in 1806, and a major issue of coppers to circulate only in Ireland. <b>Even</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> health failed, he had his servants carry him from Soho House to the Soho Mint, and he sat and watched the machinery,which was kept exceptionally busy in 1808 by the striking of almost 90,000,000 pieces for the East India Company.

500|$|At 07:00, four British {{ships and}} six French fought a {{confused}} melee while the French vanguard continued eastwards without pause and the slower {{portions of the}} British fleet struggled to {{come up in the}} light winds. The entire combat was slowly pulling closer to the fortified rocky island of Groix, close to which Villaret intended to shelter his fleet. Douglas in Queen Charlotte had been forced out of the engagement due to severe damage to his rigging and sails which made his ship unmanageable. At 07:14, he drifted past the shattered hull of Alexandre; Captain Guillemet opened fire briefly before surrendering as Douglas returned it with devastating effect. [...] <b>Even</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> ship fell back, Douglas continued to engage the French at long range, turning the guns on Peuple and Tigre, joined by Sans Pareil which attacked Tigre under Captain Jacques Bedout and forced it out of the French formation with severe damage. Villaret again attempted to gather his forces in support of Tigre, and even positioned his frigate ahead of his own fleeing ships in hope of cutting off their retreat and forcing them to imitate his own manoeuvres, but in vain; [...] "they would have passed over my very body had not [...] taken command and prevented a collision", he wrote in his report. As Tigre fell out of line, Queen and London joined the attack on the isolated ship, and Bedout was forced to surrender in the face of overwhelming odds. The French ship had been severely damaged, with [...] of water in the hold, the masts and rigging badly torn and more than 130 men killed or wounded, including Bedout, who had been hit three times.|$|E
500|$|On {{retirement}} as a player, O'Reilly {{became a}} cricket columnist for The Sydney Morning Herald, remaining {{in that position}} until his health declined in 1988. [...] His first engagement was England's tour of Australia in 1946–47, and during this season he began {{a partnership with the}} Daily Express of London, going on to cover several Ashes series for them. O'Reilly's articles for The Sydney Morning Herald were reproduced in its sister publication, The Age of Melbourne. Later, his writing was syndicated to newspapers in India, South Africa and New Zealand. His style was described by Wisden as [...] "muscular, very Australian... flavoured with wit and imagery ('You can smell the gum-leaves off him', he wrote of one country boy just starting with Queensland)." [...] Jack McHarg said that [...] "The clarity, wit and pungency of his writing, together with almost infallible judgment, never deserted him", <b>even</b> <b>as</b> <b>his</b> health began to restrict him. He was a highly respected and forthright pundit, who hated one-day cricket, describing it as [...] "hit and giggle". He condemned the omission of Keith Miller in 1949–50 and said that to call it [...] "a complete surprise would be a cowardly way of describing a botch". Reacting to the selection of the dour batting all rounder Ken Mackay, he wrote [...] "words fail...to express adequately my contempt for this howler". In 1952 he had a falling-out with Lindwall after condemning his protégé for bowling five consecutive bouncers at Everton Weekes in a Test. In comparison with his illustrious contemporary on-field and on paper, [...] "while Sir Donald walked the corridors of cricketing power O'Reilly was the rumbustious backbencher." [...] In 1956, O'Reilly strongly criticised Australian captain Ian Johnson, a Melburnian, for his leadership during the 1956 Ashes tour. The Age took exception to this and asked their sister publication to rein in their pundit. O'Reilly refused to shy away from his opinions and was dropped by the Melbourne publication. In the 1980s, when Bob Simpson became the first coach of Australia, O'Reilly, himself self-taught, spoke out against the creation of such posts. He was a strong critic of the breakaway World Series Cricket, the commercialisation of the sport and the erosion of the social norms that were followed during his playing career.|$|E
