40|$|The {{problem of}} a local <b>dent</b> on a {{pressurized}} pipe is studied in this paper. Two case problems of <b>dent</b> are considered - a plain local <b>dent</b> (a smooth local <b>dent</b> without a surface defect), and a local <b>dent</b> associated {{with a loss of}} thickness defect. The strain gauging test and the finite element analysis on the plain local <b>dent</b> showed that the strain distributions in the local <b>dent</b> are different from those of a long and continuous <b>dent.</b> The maximum hoop strain in the local <b>dent</b> is located at the flank of the <b>dent,</b> along the <b>dent</b> axial axis, whereas {{in the case of the}} long <b>dent,</b> it is located at the root of the <b>dent.</b> In addition, the peak stress in the local <b>dent</b> is generally lower than that in the long <b>dent.</b> To estimate the stress concentration in the local <b>dent</b> using the analysis for the long <b>dent</b> would be grossly overestimated. The burst pipe tests on 17 <b>dented</b> pipes showed that the pipe failures were generally insensitive to the existence of the local <b>dents.</b> The pipe failures were found to be due to the loss-of-thickness defect. The comparison of results between the burst pipe tests and the plastic collapse formula shows reasonably good agreement. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>dent</b> imperfections on the elastic stress behavior of cylindrical shells is explored. This problem is of central {{importance to the}} prediction of fatigue failure due to <b>dents</b> in petroleum pipelines. Using an approximate technique called the Equivalent Load Method, a semi-analytical model of two-dimensional <b>dent</b> stress behavior is developed. In the three-dimensional situation, decreased <b>dent</b> localization, in particular <b>dent</b> length, and increased <b>dent</b> depth are confirmed to cause <b>dent</b> stress concentration behavior to shift from having a single peak at the <b>dent</b> center to having peaks at the <b>dent</b> periphery. It is demonstrated that the equivalent load method does not predict this shift in stress behavior and cannot be relied upon to analyze relatively small, deep imperfections. The two stress modes of <b>dents</b> are associated with two modes of <b>dent</b> fatigue behavior that have significantly different fatigue lives. A method for distinguishing longer lived Mode P <b>dents</b> from shorter lived Mode C <b>dents</b> based on two measured features of <b>dent</b> geometry is developed and validated.

Acceptance criteria of <b>dents</b> are currently only based on <b>dent</b> depth. To understand the behavior of <b>dents</b> in pipelines, a finite element parametric study was performed. Three dimensional shell element models were given elasto-plastic behavior for modeling <b>dents</b> in pipelines. Parameters modeled include <b>dent</b> depth, <b>dent</b> type, <b>dent</b> restraint, pipe diameter, thickness, grade, longitudinal stress, pipe support, and pressure at indentation. For the given parameters, the rebound behavior and stress behavior of <b>dents</b> were investigated. The displacement data were studied to understand the rebound characteristics of <b>dents.</b> Stress data were studied to determine failure modes of different combinations of <b>dents</b> and pipes. <b>Dents</b> reduce in size, or rebound, with removal of the force at indentation and pressurization. The amount of rebound is influenced by several parameters such as <b>dent</b> type and pipe wall thickness. Larger <b>dents</b> in terms of surface area of the <b>dented</b> region experience more rebound than smaller <b>dents.</b> Thinner pipes experience more rebound than thicker pipes. From the finite element modeling, the rebound characteristics can be predicted for a broad range of values for the various parameters. The study of the distribution of stresses in <b>dented</b> regions shows locations of possible fatigue failures. Two different modes of failure were found to exist. Longer <b>dents</b> in terms of <b>dent</b> length are susceptible to fatigue failures in the contact region of the <b>dent.</b> Shorter <b>dents</b> are not susceptible to failures in the contact region, but can have failures away from the contact region in the <b>dent</b> periphery. Shorter <b>dents</b> have higher fatigue lives as compared to longer <b>dents.</b> The mode of failure of a <b>dent</b> is influenced by a variety of parameters. The influence of various parameters of the fatigue strength of <b>dents</b> is studied using rebound and stress behavior to develop better acceptance criteria of <b>dents</b> to improve the reliability of <b>dents</b> in pipelines...|$|R

The Japanese then made their way into the great cabin, briefly holding the captain-major hostage and carrying off his writing desk before being repelled. The flotilla's focus on the carrack left it exposed to the Portuguese galleon, which was able to support the carrack by catching the Japanese flotilla in the two ships' crossfire. The cannons wrought much havoc in the frail Japanese boats that the Hirado forces, after losing 3 ships and over 70 men, in addition to over 200 wounded, withdrew to their base crestfallen.
