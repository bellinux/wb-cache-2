25|$|The mineral {{industry}} of Africa {{is one of}} the largest mineral industries in the world. Africa is the second biggest continent, with 30 million km² of land, which implies large quantities of resources. For many African countries, mineral exploration and production constitute significant parts of their economies and remain keys to future economic growth. Africa is richly endowed with mineral reserves and ranks first or second in quantity of world reserves of bauxite, cobalt, <b>industrial</b> <b>diamond,</b> phosphate rock, platinum-group metals (PGM), vermiculite, and zirconium. Gold mining is Africa's main mining resource.|$|E
500|$|The Museum of Modern Art in New York City {{recognised}} the Bic Cristal's {{industrial design}} by introducing {{it into the}} museum's permanent collection. Its hexagonal shape resembles the typical wooden pencil and grants strength and three grip points giving high writing stability. The pen's transparent polystyrene barrel and polypropylene tube show the ink-level. A tiny hole in the barrel's body maintains the same air pressure {{inside and outside the}} pen. The thick ink flows down due to capillary action from the tube inside the barrel, to feed the ball bearing, which spins freely within a brass tip. In 1961 the stainless steel ball was replaced with much harder tungsten carbide. This ballpoint is first vitrified by heat, then ground down and milled to an accuracy of [...] between spinning plates coated with <b>industrial</b> <b>diamond</b> abrasives. Since 1991 the pen's streamlined polypropylene cap has had a small hole {{to reduce the risk of}} suffocation if the cap is inhaled. Polypropylene is used instead of polystyrene because it absorbs impact better, reducing the chance of the pen cracking or splitting if it is dropped onto the cap.|$|E
2500|$|Aluminium oxide is {{used for}} its {{hardness}} and strength. It is widely used as an abrasive, including as a much less expensive substitute for <b>industrial</b> <b>diamond.</b> Many types of sandpaper use aluminium oxide crystals. In addition, its low heat retention and low specific heat make it widely used in grinding operations, particularly cutoff tools. As the powdery abrasive mineral aloxite, {{it is a major}} component, along with silica, of the cue tip [...] "chalk" [...] used in billiards. Aluminium oxide powder is used in some CD/DVD polishing and scratch-repair kits. Its polishing qualities are also behind its use in toothpaste.|$|E

This is the largest accumulation of diamonds in the world, more concentrated than those at Kimberley, South Africa.

5|$|The {{boundary}} between gem-quality <b>diamonds</b> and <b>industrial</b> <b>diamonds</b> is poorly defined and partly depends on market conditions (for example, if demand for polished diamonds is high, some lower-grade stones will be polished into low-quality or small gemstones {{rather than being}} sold for industrial use). Within the category of <b>industrial</b> <b>diamonds,</b> there is a sub-category comprising the lowest-quality, mostly opaque stones, which are known as bort.|$|R

The city was literally constructed on top of the diamond deposits, and while the city's reputation as a company town under tight control of Belgian economic interests meant it was neat and orderly, it also meant that the city's buildings and homes, including those of top MIBA executives, were sometimes demolished to access the diamonds.|$|E

50|$|Ever {{since the}} Kimberley diamond strike of 1868, South Africa {{has been a}} world leader in diamond production. The primary South African sources of diamonds, {{including}} seven large diamond mines around the country, are controlled by the De Beers Consolidated Mines Company. In 2003, De Beers operations accounted for 94% of the nation's total diamond output of 11900000 carat t.

50|$|As De Beers <b>Industrial</b> <b>Diamond,</b> {{the company}} was set up {{initially}} {{to concentrate on the}} industrial applications of natural diamond. Following the development of diamond synthesis in the early 1950s, the company acquired the technology and by 1958 was able to manufacture material based on a high pressure, high temperature process. By the 1960s, {{the company was}} offering a range of diamond grit products that was followed by nickel and coated diamond materials plus grinding products based on cubic boron nitride. In 1992, breakthroughs in chemical vapour deposition technology opened the opportunity to synthesize diamond films and a new raft of application areas became possible.|$|E

50|$|The De Beers Group of Companies is an {{international}} corporation that specialises in diamond exploration, diamond mining, diamond retail, diamond trading and <b>industrial</b> <b>diamond</b> manufacturing sectors. The company is currently active in open-pit, large-scale alluvial, coastal and deep sea mining. It operates in 28 countries and mining takes place in Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Canada. Until {{the start of the}} 21st century, De Beers effectively had total control over the diamond market as both a monopoly and monopsony of diamonds. Opposition has since dismantled the complete monopoly, though De Beers is still a large shareholder and currently sells approximately 35% of the world's rough diamond production through its Global Sightholder Sales and Auction Sales businesses.|$|E
5000|$|During World War II, Ernest Oppenheimer {{attempted}} {{to negotiate a}} way around the Sherman Antitrust Act by proposing that De Beers register a US branch of the Diamond Syndicate Incorporated. In this way, his company could provide the US with the <b>industrial</b> <b>diamonds</b> it desperately sought for the war effort in return for immunity from prosecution after the war; however his proposal {{was rejected by the}} US Justice Department when it was discovered that De Beers had no intention of stockpiling any <b>industrial</b> <b>diamonds</b> in the US. [...] In 1945, the Justice Department finally filed an antitrust case against De Beers, but the case was dismissed as the company had no presence on US soil.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, De Beers {{pleaded guilty}} and paid a US$10 million fine to the United States Department of Justice {{to settle a}} 1994 charge that De Beers had colluded with General Electric, which was acquitted of all charges, to fix the price of <b>industrial</b> <b>diamonds.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Annual {{report by}} all KPCS members is a {{component}} of peer review mechanism established by KPCS. In the United States, for example, all companies that buy, sell, and ship rough diamonds must submit an annual report via email to the State Department, deadline April 1. [...] The report must include the company's contact information and a detailed breakdown of the total carat weight and value in U.S. dollars of rough diamonds imported, exported, and stockpiled (still in inventory) for the previous calendar year. These are also sorted by HTS codes for unsorted (gem and <b>industrial)</b> rough <b>diamonds,</b> sorted rough <b>industrial</b> <b>diamonds,</b> and sorted rough gem diamonds—the latter of which {{is most likely to}} be polished into finished stones and jewelry for retail sale, while <b>industrial</b> <b>diamonds</b> {{are most likely to be}} used in cutting and drilling tools. Failure to submit this annual report in a timely fashion could result in a fine up to $10,000. If found to be in willful violation, the convicted offender could be fined up to $50,000 and sentenced to jail time up to ten years.|$|R
