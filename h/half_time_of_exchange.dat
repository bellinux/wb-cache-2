Pre-incubation with ouabain and NaZ 2, produces greater and more predictable effects on the t, which increases with the length of pre-incubation up to about 30 hours at 2 s 0 c. Incubation in a moist chamber of muscles briefly exposed to ouabain and then washed in a ouabain-free solution to re-move ouabain in the extracellular space, cause continued increase of t, up to 24 hours...|$|E
40|$|Plutonium and (90) Sr are {{considered}} to be among the most radiotoxic nuclides produced by the nuclear fission process. In spite of numerous studies on mammals and humans there is still no general agreement on the retention <b>half</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> both radionuclides in the skeleton in the general population. Here we determined plutonium and (90) Sr in human vertebrae in individuals deceased between 1960 and 2004 in Switzerland. Plutonium was measured by sensitive SF-ICP-MS techniques and (90) Sr by radiometric methods. We compared our results to the ones obtained for other environmental compartments to reveal the retention <b>half</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> NBT fallout (239) Pu and (90) Sr in trabecular bones of the Swiss population. Results show that plutonium has a retention <b>half</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> 40 +/- 14 years. In contrast (90) Sr has a shorter retention <b>half</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> 13. 5 +/- 1. 0 years. Moreover (90) Sr retention <b>half</b> <b>time</b> in vertebrae is shown to be linked to the retention <b>half</b> <b>time</b> in food and other environmental compartments. These findings demonstrate that the renewal of the vertebrae through calcium homeostatic control is faster for (90) Sr excretion than for plutonium excretion. The precise determination <b>of</b> the retention <b>half</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> plutonium in the skeleton will improve the biokinetic model of plutonium metabolism in humans...|$|R

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of phosphocreatine (PC) {{breakdown in}} human plantar flexors {{at the onset}} of constant-load aerobic exercise was determined by high-resolution 31 P-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMRS). The <b>half</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the process (t 1 / 2 PC) was obtained by fitting curves (n = 13) from five subjects at various aerobic work loads for which muscle pH was not different from that at rest. Steady-state PC concentration ([PC]) was not < 70 % of the resting value and was linearly related to the work load (w) ([PC] = - 3. 01 +/- 0. 08 w + 1 (r = 0. 48, 2 P < 0. 1)). The average t 1 / 2 PC was 16. 2 s and was independent of work load. Because the <b>half</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the muscle PC kinetics reflects the <b>half</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the O 2 uptake (MO 2) kinetics (t 1 / 2 MO 2), the latter is equal to that found earlier in the isolated perfused dog gastrocnemius. Whereas in the dog the above t 1 / 2 MO 2 compares well with the homologous <b>half</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> the O 2 uptake at the alveolar level, in humans such equivalence is found only at extremely low work loads, when the transient contribution by anaerobic glycolysis is negligible...|$|R

After exposure ceased, the elimination of toluene was followed up in 11 subjects. The toluene concentration in venous blood decreased non-linearly and the elimination curves contained at least three exponential components. The first two had median estimated <b>half</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> nine minutes and two hours respectively.

40|$|Coronavirus {{spike protein}} genes were {{expressed}} in vitro {{by using the}} recombinant vaccinia virus expression system. Recombinant spike proteins were expressed at the cell surface and induced cell fusion in a host-cell-dependent fashion. The intracellular transport of recombinant spike proteins was studied. The <b>half</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> acquisition of resistance to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H was approximately 3 h for the recombinant feline infectious peritonitis virus S protein. The S protein in feline infectious peritonitis virus-infected cells {{was found to have}} a <b>half</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> acquisition of resistance to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H of approximately 1 h. This difference {{can be explained by the}} fact that coronavirus budding takes place at intracellular membranes and that the oligosaccharides of the spike protein are modified after budding. Apparently, spike protein incorporated into budded virions is transported faster through the Golgi apparatus than is spike protein alone. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism of coronavirus budding and are discussed in relation to current models of intracellular transport and sorting of proteins...|$|R

40|$|Thirty four {{patients}} with aortic regurgitation were studied by continuous wave Doppler ultrasound. In 30 of these the regurgitation was graded by cineangiography as mild, moderate, or severe and in four severe regurgitation was confirmed at operation. The <b>half</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> the aortoventricular pressure differences obtained with Doppler compared well with those obtained from pressure recordings at catheterisation. The relation between pressure <b>half</b> <b>times</b> and cineangiographic gradings of severity was not consistent. Similarly, {{a control group}} of {{patients with}}out aortic regurgitation showed {{a wide range of}} the invasively recorded pressure <b>half</b> <b>times</b> which overlapped with those in patients with aortic regurgitation. This suggests that factors such as systemic vascular resistance, and aortic and left ventricular compliance can have an appreciable effect on the pressure <b>half</b> <b>time.</b> If these factors are not included the method will be of limited value, except in patients with pressure <b>half</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> less than 300 ms, when regurgitation invariably is severe.
