5|$|In geodesy, {{the exact}} shape that Earth's oceans would adopt {{in the absence}} of land and {{perturbations}} such as tides and winds is called the <b>geoid.</b> More precisely, the <b>geoid</b> is the surface of gravitational equipotential at mean sea level.|$|E
5|$|A {{detailed}} topographic {{analysis of}} the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain reveals the hotspot {{as the center of}} a topographic high, and that elevation falls with distance from the hotspot. The most rapid decrease in elevation and the highest ratio between the topography and <b>geoid</b> height are over the southeastern part of the chain, falling with distance from the hotspot, particularly at the intersection of the Molokai and Murray fracture zones. The most likely explanation is that the region between the two zones is more susceptible to reheating than most of the chain. Another possible explanation is that the hotspot strength swells and subsides over time.|$|E
25|$|A third {{model is}} the <b>geoid,</b> a more complex and {{accurate}} representation of Earth's shape coincident with what mean sea level would be {{if there were no}} winds, tides, or land. Compared to the best fitting ellipsoid, a geoidal model would change the characterization of important properties such as distance, conformality and equivalence. Therefore, in geoidal projections that preserve such properties, the mapped graticule would deviate from a mapped ellipsoid's graticule. Normally the <b>geoid</b> is not used as an Earth model for projections, however, because Earth's shape is very regular, with the undulation of the <b>geoid</b> amounting to less than 100m from the ellipsoidal model out of the 6.3millionm Earth radius. For irregular planetary bodies such as asteroids, however, sometimes models analogous to the <b>geoid</b> are used to project maps from.|$|E
40|$|A {{study has}} been made of the gravity field of the earth using a {{combined}} solution from free air anomalies and satellite data. Spherical harmonics up to order 8. 8 have been computed in a joint solution. Satellite data from Doppler tracking (NWL) and optical observations (SAO) were added in a combined solution with full consideration of the complete covariance matrix. -This study was based on the most complete set of gravity data so far presented (approximately 500, 000). The simplest type of a world geodetic system includes only geometrical observations. Such systems have a limited geodetic application because no dynamic properties can be derived from purely geometrical observations. A geodetic system {{that is going to be}} used for ballistic applications has to incorporate a solution of the gravi-metric boundary value problem consistent with the geometrical representation. Present geodetic systems already include a number of dynamic parameters presented in the form of so-called <b>geoids.</b> These <b>geoids</b> are establishing valuable reference systems mainly in a conservative application, i. e., when geometrical measurements are reduced to an analytical reference surface (normally the international ellipsoid) ...|$|R

In 3D computer graphics, spherical harmonics play a role {{in a wide variety of}} topics including indirect lighting (ambient occlusion, global illumination, precomputed radiance transfer, etc.) and modelling of 3D shapes.|$|R
40|$|Requirements {{for marine}} geodesy are examined, {{taking into account}} {{accuracy}} requirements for certain marine operations, boundary and positioning problems in offshore Norway, navigation requirements for nodule exploration and mining, and the determination of marine boundaries at sea. Subjects related to marine geodesy and positioning/navigation are discussed along with topics concerned with marine geodesy and ocean physics. Satellite altimetry and modern <b>geoids</b> method are considered and attention is given to marine gravity anomalies and geodesy. Individual items are announced in this issue...|$|R
25|$|As {{the science}} of geodesy {{measured}} Earth more accurately, {{the shape of the}} <b>geoid</b> was first found not to be a perfect sphere but to approximate an oblate spheroid, a specific type of ellipsoid. More recent measurements have measured the <b>geoid</b> to unprecedented accuracy, revealing mass concentrations beneath Earth's surface.|$|E
25|$|For {{every point}} on Earth, the local {{direction}} of gravity or vertical direction, materialized with the plumb line, is {{perpendicular to the}} <b>geoid.</b> On this is based a method, astrogeodetic levelling, for deriving the local figure of the <b>geoid</b> by measuring deflections of the vertical by astronomical means over an area.|$|E
25|$|During the 1970s it was {{realized}} that gravitational time dilation caused the second produced by each atomic clock to differ depending on its altitude. A uniform second {{was produced by}} correcting the output of each atomic clock to mean sea level (the rotating <b>geoid),</b> lengthening the second by about 1. This correction was applied {{at the beginning of}} 1977 and formalized in 1980. In relativistic terms, the SI second is defined as the proper time on the rotating <b>geoid.</b>|$|E
50|$|Prior {{to the era}} of {{satellite}} geodesy, the coordinate systems associated with a geodetic datum attempted to be geocentric, but their origins differed from the geocentre by hundreds of metres, due to regional deviations {{in the direction of}} the plumbline (vertical). These regional geodetic data, such as ED 50 (European Datum 1950) or NAD 27 (North American Datum 1927) have ellipsoids associated with them that are regional 'best fits' to the <b>geoids</b> within their areas of validity, minimising the deflections of the vertical over these areas.|$|R
40|$|A {{determination}} of the fine scale sea surface topography in the GEOS- 3 calibration area using the radar altimeter data is presented. Estimates of the north-south and east-west components of the deflections of the vertical as well as values of the geoidal heights were made. Three major stages of processing were used in obtaining the final results. The first two use pass processors; in the final stage, the processor combines all the pass results to compute the final results. The results obtained compare favorably with gravimetrically determined <b>geoids</b> for this calibration area...|$|R

25|$|The north Atlantic is {{characterized}} by strong, large-scale anomalies of the gravity field and the <b>geoid.</b> The <b>geoid</b> rises up to 70 m above the geodetic reference ellipsoid in an approximately circular area with a diameter of several hundred kilometers. In {{the context of the}} plume hypothesis, this has been explained by the dynamic effect of the upwelling plume which bulges up the surface of the Earth. Furthermore, the plume and the thickened crust cause a positive gravity anomaly of about 60 mGal (=0.0006m/s²) (free-air).|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{irregularity}} of the Earth's true gravity field, {{the equilibrium}} figure of sea water, or the <b>geoid,</b> {{will also be}} of irregular form. In some places, like west of Ireland, the geoid—mathematical mean sea level—sticks {{out as much as}} 100 m above the regular, rotationally symmetric reference ellipsoid of GRS80; in other places, like close to Ceylon, it dives under the ellipsoid by nearly the same amount. The separation between these two surfaces is called the undulation of the <b>geoid,</b> symbol , and is closely related to the disturbing potential.|$|E
25|$|Two {{levels of}} {{abstraction}} {{are employed in}} the definition of latitude and longitude. In the first step the physical surface is modeled by the <b>geoid,</b> a surface which approximates the mean sea level over the oceans and its continuation under the land masses. The second step is to approximate the <b>geoid</b> by a mathematically simpler reference surface. The simplest choice for the reference surface is a sphere, but the <b>geoid</b> is more accurately modeled by an ellipsoid. The definitions of latitude and longitude on such reference surfaces are detailed in the following sections. Lines of constant latitude and longitude together constitute a graticule on the reference surface. The latitude of a point on the actual surface is that of the corresponding point on the reference surface, the correspondence being along the normal to the reference surface which passes through the point on the physical surface. Latitude and longitude together with some specification of height constitute a geographic coordinate system as defined in the specification of the ISO 19111 standard.|$|E

GRACE-based time series have been compared to snow water equivalent and snow depth climatologies, and snowfall for validation purpose. Time series of regional averages of water volume were estimated for the 11 largest Peri-Arctic basins. Strong correlations {{were found between the}} snow estimates and river discharges in the Arctic basins (0. 49 to 0. 8). Then changes in land water storage were compared to precipitation minus evapotranspiration fluxes to determine which flux of the hydrological budget controls the Arctic hydrology. Results are very contrasted according to the basin. Trends of snow and land water masses were 20 also computed over the 2003 - 2006 period. Eurasian basins lose snow mass whereas North American basins are gaining mass...|$|R

25|$|Information {{about the}} {{structure}} of Earth's deep interior can be acquired only indirectly by geophysical and geochemical methods. For the investigation of postulated plumes, gravimetric, <b>geoid</b> and in particular seismological methods along with geochemical analyses of erupted lavas have proven especially useful. Numerical models of the geodynamical processes attempt to merge these observations into a consistent general picture.|$|E
25|$|Another model {{proposes that}} the {{upwelling}} in the Iceland region {{is driven by}} lateral temperature gradients between the suboceanic mantle and the neighbouring Greenland craton and therefore also restricted to the upper 200–300km of the mantle. However, this convection mechanism is probably not strong enough under the conditions prevailing in the north Atlantic, {{with respect to the}} spreading rate, and it does not offer a simple explanation for the observed <b>geoid</b> anomaly.|$|E
40|$|We analyze Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) {{water surface}} {{elevation}} data to assess the capacity of interferometric radar for future surface water missions. Elevations from three Ohio reservoirs and several Amazon floodplain lakes have standard deviations, interpreted as errors, that are smaller in C-band compared to X-band and are smaller in Ohio than in the Amazon. These trends are also evident when comparing {{water surface elevation}}s from the Muskingum River in Ohio {{with those of the}} Amazon River. Differences are attributed to increased averaging in C-band compared to X-band, greater sensitivity to surface water motion in X-band, and generally larger off-nadir look angles in X-band. Absolute water surface elevations are greater in the C-band DEM for much of the two study areas and yield expected slope values. Height and slope differences are attributed to differing usage of <b>geoids</b> and ellipsoids. These SRTM measurements suggest the great possibility for space-based, laterally-spatial (2 D) measurements of water surface elevations...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSince its {{launch in}} March 2002, the GRACE mission is {{measuring}} the global time {{variations of the}} Earth's gravity field with a current resolution of ~ 500 km. Especially over the continents, these measurements represent the integrated land water mass including surface waters (lakes, wetlands and rivers), soil moisture, groundwater and snow cover. In this study, we use the GRACE land water solutions computed by Ramillien et al. (2005 a) through an iterative inversion of monthly <b>geoids</b> from April 2002 to May 2004, to estimate time-series of basin-scale regional evapotranspiration rate -and associated uncertainties-. Evapotranspiration is determined by integrating and solving the water mass balance equation, which relates land water storage (from GRACE), precipitation data (from the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre), runoff (from a global land surface model) and evapotranspiration (the unknown). We further examine the sensibility of the computation when using different model runoff. Evapotranspiration results are compared to outputs of four different global land surface models. The overall satisfactory agreement between GRACE-derived and model-based evapotranspiration prove the ability of GRACE to provide realistic estimates of this parameter...|$|R
40|$|It {{is often}} {{critically}} important that geospatial data are measured and mapped accurately, particularly for quantitative analyses and numerical modelling applications. Defining a geographical coordinate system requires a non-unique combination of geodetic techniques (e. g. ellipsoids, projections and <b>geoids).</b> The choice of geographical system presents scope for ambiguity and confusion about geographical data, especially those archived without appropriate metadata. Experience {{has shown that}} these confusions have been a repeating source of either frustration or inadvertent error for those using geographical data from Montserrat. This is, in part, probably due to common usage of multiple datums {{and the existence of}} numerous topographical datasets recorded during the past 150 years. Here, we attempt to provide a brief introduction to geodetic principles and their application to Montserrat geographical data. The differences between common datums are illustrated and we describe variations in magnetic declination as they apply to field use of magnetic instruments. We include a record of the source of the large-scale mapping datasets that have been used and analysed ubiquitously in the literature. The descriptions here are intended as an introductory reference resource for those using geographical data from Montserrat...|$|R
25|$|Another {{approach}} is to combine multiple information sources: not just terrestrial gravimetry, but also satellite geodetic data on {{the figure of the}} Earth, from analysis of satellite orbital perturbations, and lately from satellite gravity missions such as GOCE and GRACE. In such combination solutions, the low-resolution part of the <b>geoid</b> solution is provided by the satellite data, while a 'tuned' version of the above Stokes equation is used to calculate the high-resolution part, from terrestrial gravimetric data from a neighbourhood of the evaluation point only.|$|E
25|$|If a {{particular}} point on a sphere is (arbitrarily) designated as its north pole, then the corresponding antipodal point {{is called the}} south pole, and the equator is the great circle that is equidistant to them. Great circles through the two poles are called lines (or meridians) of longitude, and the line connecting the two poles is called the axis of rotation. Circles on the sphere that are parallel to the equator are lines of latitude. This terminology is also used for such approximately spheroidal astronomical bodies as the planet Earth (see <b>geoid).</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{same two}} factors {{influence}} {{the direction of}} the effective gravity (as determined by a plumb line or as the perpendicular to the surface of water in a container). Anywhere on Earth away from the Equator or poles, effective gravity points not exactly toward the centre of the Earth, but rather perpendicular {{to the surface of the}} <b>geoid,</b> which, due to the flattened shape of the Earth, is somewhat toward the opposite pole. About half of the deflection is due to centrifugal force, and half because the extra mass around the Equator causes a change in {{the direction of the}} true gravitational force relative to what it would be on a spherical Earth.|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} case of a 48 -year-old male, whose {{musculoskeletal}} manifestations, previously related to long-term renal replacement therapy (RRT), were diagnosed as ankylosing spondylitis when symptoms changed their pattern on daily hemodialysis (DHD). The patient started RRT in 1981; in 1985 he received a cadaver graft, which failed in 1987. Secondary hyperparathyroidism, amyloid <b>geoids,</b> bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome and high aluminium levels were present. Musculoskeletal pain, reported since 1986, involved feet, heels, hips, shoulders, hands, spine. Symptoms impairing daily life did not improve after parathyroidectomy. He developed chronic hypotension and recurrent atrial fibrillation. In 1994 and 1998, because of thoracic pain, coronarography was performed (normal on both occasions). In June 2000, DHD was started. Equivalent renal clearance increased from 9 - 12 to 15 - 17 mL/min. Well-being remarkably improved. In September 2000, musculoskeletal pain worsened and bilateral Achilles tendinitis occurred. The worsening of musculoskeletal symptoms despite the improvements in well-being and other dialysis related symptoms prompted a re-evaluation of the case. The diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis was based on: history of plantar fasciitis, bilateral Achilles tendinitis, inflammatory spinal pain with limitation of lumbar spine mobility (positive Schober test), radiological evidence of grade 2 bilateral sacroiliitis, presence of HLA-B 27. This diagnosis cast light on the episodes of chest pain, explained by enthesopathy at the costosternal and manubriosternal joints and atrial fibrillation, due to HLA-B 27 associated impairment in heart conduction. This case exemplifies the difficulty of differential diagnosis of multisystem illness in patients with long RRT follow-up...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBy {{delivering}} monthly maps of {{the gravity}} field, the GRACE project allows the determination of tiny time variations of the Earth's gravity and particularly the effects of fluid mass redistributions at {{the surface of the}} Earth. However, GRACE data represent vertically integrated gravity measurements, thus are the sum of all mass redistributions inside the Earth's system (atmosphere, oceans and continental water storage, plus solid Earth). In this paper, we apply a generalized least-squares inverse approach, previously developed by [1] [G. Ramillien, A. Cazenave, O. Brunau, Global time-variations of hydrological signals from GRACE satellite gravimetry, Geophys. J. Int. 158 (2004) 813 – 826. ], to estimate, from the monthly GRACE <b>geoids,</b> continental water storage variations (and their associated uncertainties) over a 2 -year time span (April 2002 to May 2004). Tests demonstrating the robustness of the method are presented, including the separation between liquid water reservoirs (surface waters+soil moisture+groundwaters) and snow pack contributions. Individual monthly solutions of total land water storage from GRACE, with a spatial resolution of ~ 660 km, are presented for the 2 -year time span. We also derive the seasonal cycle map. We further estimate water volume changes over eight large river basins in the tropics and compare with model predictions. Finally, we attempt to estimate an average value of the evapotranspiration over each river basin, using the water balance equation which links temporal change in water volume to precipitation, evapotranspiration and runoff. Amplitudes of the GRACE-derived evapotranspiration are regionally consistent to the predictions of global hydrological models...|$|R

A few centuries later the Greeks viewed it as a sphere, which was supported by various observations and even the radius of a spherical Earth was calculated. The discoveries of the great astronomers of the 16 th and 17 th century showed that the shape of the Earth could not be a sphere. Based on their calculations they viewed it as a rotation ellipsoid. By {{the second half of the}} 19 th century we came to understand that the rotation ellipsoid as a theoretical earth shape is not sustainable in all cases. Today we acquire more precise information on the <b>geoids</b> with the help of satellites, especially with those serving navigational purposes. With the help of remote sensors we can learn about the surface of the earth without actually having to come into contact with it.

25|$|The ocean's {{surface is}} closely {{approximated}} by an equipotential surface, (ignoring ocean currents) {{commonly referred to}} as the <b>geoid.</b> Since the gravitational force is equal to the potential's gradient, there are no tangential forces on such a surface, and the ocean surface is thus in gravitational equilibrium. Now consider the effect of massive external bodies such as the Moon and Sun. These bodies have strong gravitational fields that diminish with distance and act to alter the shape of an equipotential surface on the Earth. This deformation has a fixed spatial orientation relative to the influencing body. The Earth's rotation relative to this shape causes the daily tidal cycle. Gravitational forces follow an inverse-square law (force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance), but tidal forces are inversely proportional to the cube of the distance. The ocean surface moves because of the changing tidal equipotential, rising when the tidal potential is high, which occurs on the parts of the Earth nearest to and furthest from the Moon. When the tidal equipotential changes, the ocean surface is no longer aligned with it, so the apparent direction of the vertical shifts. The surface then experiences a down slope, in the direction that the equipotential has risen.|$|E

40|$|The nutations of {{the planets}} Mars and Earth are {{investigated}} and compared. A large number of interior structure parameters {{are involved in the}} nutation computations. The comparison between the observations and the computations provides several constraints on these parmeters and therefore allows {{a better understanding of the}} physics of the interior of the planet. For the Earth, the high precision of the observations of the nutations has led to a very good determination of interior properties of the planet. For Mars, observations of nutations are not yet available, and we review how the amplitude of the Martian nutations depends on the hypotheses considered for its interior. Although Mars is very similar to the Earth, its interior is not well known; for example, we don't know if its core is liquid or solid. Only if the core is liquid, the Free Core Nutation (FCN) normal mode exists and can alter the nutations which are close to the resonance. From the observed <b>geoids,</b> it is known that both planets are not in hydrostatic equilibrium. The departure is larger for Mars than for the Earth, and consequently, the implication of considering a convective mantle instead of a mantle in hydrostatic equilibrium described by Clairaut's equation for the initial equilibrium state of the planet is larger on the Martian nutations than on the Earth nutations. The consequences of the uncertainty in the core dimensions are also examined and shown to be of a very high influence for Mars if the core is liquid, due to the potential changes in the FCN resonance. The influence of the presence of an inner core, which is known to exist for the Earth, could be more important for Mars than for the Earth if the inner core is large.

40|$|International audience[1] Mantle {{rheology}} {{is one of}} the essential, yet least understood, {{material properties}} of our planet, controlling the dynamic processes inside the Earth's mantle and the Earth's response to various forces. With the advent of GRACE satellite gravity, measurements of mass displacements associated with many processes are now available. In the case of mass displacements related to postseismic deformation, these data may provide new constraints on the mantle rheology. We consider the postseismic deformation due to the M w = 9. 2 Sumatra 26 December 2004 and M w = 8. 7 Nias 28 March 2005 earthquakes. Applying wavelet analyses to enhance those local signals in the GRACE time varying <b>geoids</b> up to September 2007, we detect a clear postseismic gravity signal. We supplement these gravity variations with GPS measurements of postseismic crustal displacements to constrain postseismic relaxation processes throughout the upper mantle. The observed GPS displacements and gravity variations are well explained by a model of visco-elastic relaxation plus a small amount of afterslip at the downdip extension of the coseismically ruptured fault planes. Our model uses a 60 km thick elastic layer above a viscoelastic asthenosphere with Burgers body rheology. The mantle below depth 220 km has a Maxwell rheology. Assuming a low transient viscosity in the 60 – 220 km depth range, the GRACE data are best explained by a constant steady state viscosity throughout the ductile portion of the upper mantle (e. g., 60 – 660 km). This suggests that the localization of relatively low viscosity in the asthenosphere is chiefly in the transient viscosity rather than the steady state viscosity. We find a 8. 10 18 Pa s mantle viscosity in the 220 – 660 km depth range. This may indicate a transient response of the upper mantle to the high amount of stress released by the earthquakes. To fit the remaining misfit to the GRACE data, larger at the smaller spatial scales, cumulative afterslip of about 75 cm at depth should be added over the period spanned by the GRACE models. It produces only small crustal displacements. Our results confirm that satellite gravity data are an essential complement to ground geodetic and geophysical networks {{in order to understand the}} seismic cycle and the Earth's inner structure...|$|R
40|$|The first gravity {{determinations}} in Norway {{were made}} by Edward Sabine in 1823 with a pendulum instrument by Henry Kater. Seventy years later a Sterneck pendulum was acquired by the Norwegian Commission for the International Arc Measurements. It improved the precision and eventually reduced the bias of the absolute calibration from 85 to 15  mGal. The last pendulum observations in Norway were made in 1955 with an instrument from Cambridge University. At a precision of ± 1  mGal, {{the purpose was to}} calibrate a section of the gravity line from Rome, Italy, to Hammerfest, Norway. Relative spring gravimeters were introduced in Norway in 1946 and were used to densify and expand the national gravity network. These data were used to produce regional <b>geoids</b> for Norway and adjacent ocean areas. Improved instrument precision allowed them to connect Norwegian and foreign fundamental stations as well. Extensive geophysical prospecting was made, as in other countries. The introduction of absolute gravimeters based on free-fall methods, especially after 2004, improved the calibration by 3 orders of magnitude and immediately revealed the secular changes of the gravity field in Norway. This was later confirmed by satellite gravimetry, which provides homogeneous data sets for global and regional gravity models. The first-ever determinations of gravity at sea {{were made by}} pendulum observations onboard the Norwegian polar vessel Fram during frozen-in conditions in the Arctic Ocean in 1893 – 1896. Simultaneously, an indirect method was developed at the University of Oslo for deducing gravity at sea with a hypsometer. The precision of both methods was greatly superseded by relative spring gravimeters 50 years later. They were employed extensively both at sea and on land. When GPS allowed precise positioning, relative gravimeters were mounted in airplanes to cover large areas of ocean faster than before. Gravimetry is currently being applied to study geodynamical phenomena relevant to climate change. The viscoelastic postglacial land uplift of Fennoscandia has been detected by terrestrial gravity time series as well as by satellite gravimetry. Corrections for local effects of snow load, hydrology, and ocean loading at coastal stations have been improved. The elastic adjustment of present-day melting of glaciers at Svalbard and in mainland Norway has been detected. Gravimetry is extensively employed at offshore oil facilities to monitor the subsidence of the ocean floor during oil and gas extraction...|$|R
