50|$|The tallest {{mountain}} in the Beskid Dukielski, Piotruś is relatively flat-structured, giving it its alternative name of Płazyna. The mountain is crescent-shaped, aligned roughly north-south. It is bounded {{to the west and}} south by the valley of the Jasiołka river, separating it from Ostra Mountain to the south. The mountain is covered in forest, primarily old beech trees, and near the top, in birch, <b>European</b> <b>mountain-ash</b> and alder. A spruce forest on Piotruśs western slope was mostly destroyed in a fire during the interwar period. A yellow sandstone rock is prominently displayed {{at the top of the}} mountain, which likely contributed to its name (Piotr - Polish for Peter - also means stone). Some of it was excavated for buildings, and several unused large blocks can be found.|$|E
5000|$|The {{binomial}} name Sorbus aucuparia {{is composed}} of the Latin words sorbus for service tree and aucuparia, which derives from the words avis for [...] "bird" [...] and capere for [...] "catching" [...] and describes {{the use of the}} fruit of S. aucuparia as bait for fowling. The plant is commonly known as rowan and mountain-ash, and has also been called Amur mountain-ash, <b>European</b> <b>mountain-ash,</b> quick beam, quickbeam, or rowan-berry. The names rowan and mountain ash may be applied to other species in Sorbus subgenus Sorbus, and mountain ash may be used for several other distantly related trees. The species is unrelated to the true ash trees (genus Fraxinus), which also carry pinnate leaves or the species Eucalyptus regnans, also called mountain ash, native to Tasmania and Victoria in southeastern Australia. S. aucuparia was previously categorized as Pyrus aucuparia. The author citation Sorbus aucuparia L. belongs to Carl Linnaeus.|$|E
