25|$|In some {{drainage}} projects, one {{may find}} that only main drainage systems are envisaged. The agricultural land is then still {{likely to suffer from}} <b>field</b> <b>drainage</b> problems. In other cases, one {{may find that}} <b>field</b> <b>drainage</b> systems are ineffective because there is no adequate main drainage system. In either case, the installation of drainage systems is not recommended.|$|E

25|$|In literature, {{not much}} {{information}} {{can be found on}} the relations between the various regular surface <b>field</b> <b>drainage</b> systems, the reduction in the degree of waterlogging, and the agricultural or environmental effects. It is therefore difficult to develop sound agricultural criteria for the regular surface <b>field</b> <b>drainage</b> systems. Most of the known criteria for these systems concern the efficiency of the techniques of land leveling and earthmoving.|$|E
25|$|New <b>field</b> <b>drainage</b> work {{on farms}} in the 18th and 19th centuries had {{dramatic}} effects on water courses, most often recorded through complaints by millers that {{they could no longer}} get enough water to turn their mills waterwheels.|$|E
25|$|Disposal drains are main drains {{in which}} {{the depth of the}} water level below the soil surface is not bound to a minimum, and the water level may even be above the soil surface, {{provided}} that embankments are made to prevent inundation. Disposal drains can serve both subsurface and surface <b>field</b> <b>drainage</b> systems.|$|E
50|$|The {{remaining}} impurities {{are trapped}} and eliminated in the soil, with the excess water eliminated through percolation into the soil, through evaporation, and by uptake through the root system {{of plants and}} eventual transpiration or entering groundwater or surface water. A piping network, often laid in a stone-filled trench (see weeping tile), distributes the wastewater throughout the <b>field</b> with multiple <b>drainage</b> holes in the network. The size of the drain field {{is proportional to the}} volume of wastewater and inversely proportional to the porosity of the <b>drainage</b> <b>field.</b> The entire septic system can operate by gravity alone or, where topographic considerations require, with inclusion of a lift pump. Certain septic tank designs include siphons or other devices to increase the volume and velocity of outflow to the <b>drainage</b> <b>field.</b> These help to fill the drainage pipe more evenly and extend the <b>drainage</b> <b>field</b> life by preventing premature clogging or bioclogging.|$|R

50|$|Since its opening, {{the field}} has {{received}} several improvements. An electronic scoreboard was installed for the men's field in 1969 and upgraded in 1993. The women's field received an electronic scoreboard in 1999. In 2005, the men's <b>field</b> had <b>drainage</b> systems installed and was resodded.|$|R
25|$|Figure 1 classifies {{the various}} types of {{drainage}} systems. It shows the field (or internal) and the main (or external) systems. The function of the <b>field</b> <b>drainage</b> system is to control the water table, whereas the function of the main drainage system is to collect, transport, and dispose of the water through an outfall or outlet. In some instances one makes an additional distinction between collector and main drainage systems.|$|E
2500|$|Deep {{collector}} drains {{are required}} for subsurface <b>field</b> <b>drainage</b> systems, whereas shallow collector drains are used for surface <b>field</b> <b>drainage</b> systems, {{but they can also}} be used for pumped subsurface systems.

50|$|Estimated yield: Factors {{that affect}} yield are {{numerous}} and complex. A <b>field’s</b> soils, <b>drainage,</b> insect, weed and crop disease pressure, rotation {{and many other}} factors differentiate one field from another. This is why using historic yields is important in developing yield estimates for next year. Accurate yield estimates can improve nutrient use efficiency.|$|R
5000|$|Over time, biofilms develop on {{the pipes}} of the <b>drainage</b> <b>field,</b> {{which can lead}} to blockage. Such a failure can be {{referred}} to as [...] "biomat failure".|$|R
2500|$|The {{subsurface}} <b>field</b> <b>drainage</b> systems {{consist of}} horizontal or slightly sloping channels {{made in the}} soil; they can be open ditches, trenches, filled with brushwood and a soil cap, filled with stones and a soil cap, buried pipe drains, tile drains, or mole drains, {{but they can also}} consist of a series of wells.|$|E
2500|$|The Warner Lakes are fed by Twentymile Creek and Deep Creek at {{the south}} end and Honey Creek which flows into Hart Lake. [...] Most of the water from Twentymile Creek flows into Greaser Reservoir or into {{irrigation}} canals in the South Warner Valley. [...] As <b>field</b> <b>drainage,</b> some of its water eventually merges with Deep Creek and flow into Pelican Lake.|$|E

This will not be easy; Alan was a keen sportsman and a man of tact. He {{commanded}} the farmers' respect and had the interest of the hunt at heart. For all that, the hunt is a useful institution and must be kept up. Fish are getting scarce; modern <b>field</b> <b>drainage</b> sends down the water in sudden floods and when, between times, the rivers run low the trout and salmon are the otter's easy prey. It is our duty to preserve the fisheries, and help, as far as we are able, a bracing English sport." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{fourth and}} final major {{renovation}} included updating the lower-level concourse by adding new signage and seating and installing updated televisions in the club levels. Several banners depicting moments throughout Panthers history were also added to the lower concourse. The seating capacity was slightly increased thanks to upgrades at the club level. A new <b>field</b> and <b>drainage</b> system were additionally installed.|$|R

40|$|Accurate {{quantification}} of hydrocarbon saturation (1 - Sw), a key volumetric parameter in reservoir characterisation, has {{a profound}} impact on the economic development potential of oil and gas <b>fields.</b> <b>Drainage</b> capillary pressure (Pc) data acquired from core are required to model initial water saturation (Sw) distribution in the reservoir as a function of height above the free water level. Imbibition (Sw increasing) Pc is not considered in this paper. Pc data can be acquired from core by a variety of methods – traditionally by ultracentrifuge, porous plate and air-mercury injection. Each technique has its own advantages and disadvantages – in terms of how well the Pc curve is characterised. The ultracentrifuge offers several advantages including achieving higher capillary pressure and much shorter test duration than porous plate. A disadvantage is that the Pc curve is constructed indirectly, based upon Sw calculated from a theoretical model(s) [15]. Although the accuracy of Pc curve modelling improved significantly during the 1990 ’s based upon the work of such authors as Forbes [6], the capacity to form a robust bu...|$|R

50|$|Improving <b>field</b> <b>drainage</b> {{and soil}} tillage are {{cultural}} practices {{that can help}} minimize the effect of Phytophthora sojae. Improving soil tillage can help eliminate oospores from the soil. Oospores are very sturdy and can remain stagnant in the soil {{for a long time}} and therefore crop rotation alone is not effective. Proper <b>field</b> <b>drainage</b> prevents flooding and therefore inhibit zoospore movement towards the host.|$|E

40|$|Seven pike Esox lucius L., {{implanted}} with radio-transmitters, were tracked throughout autumn {{and winter}} in the River Frome, a southern English chalk river. During the first flood events of the year, pike remained within the main river channel but during subsequent flood events, pike could {{also be found in}} flooded <b>fields,</b> in <b>drainage</b> ditches or in a millstream. Eighty percent of the fixes over flooded land occurred within 10 m of the riverbank, although distances of up to 89 m from the bank were recorded. In ditches, pike could be found over 250 m from the main river. For pike in ditches and flooded fields, distance from the main river channel was positively correlated with discharge. There was individual variation amongst pike for the habitat types selected, with some pike utilising flooded field or ditch habitat more often than others. The proportion of time spent out of the main river channel {{does not appear to be}} related to the size of the pike. It is hypothesised that pike are leaving the main river channel to exploit feeding opportunities in the flooded <b>fields</b> and <b>drainage</b> ditches, rather than using these areas as refugia from high flow conditions. ...|$|R
