25|$|The top {{and back}} are {{traditionally}} hand-carved, though less expensive cellos are often machine-produced. The sides, or ribs, {{are made by}} heating the wood and bending it around forms. The cello body has a wide top bout, narrow middle formed by two C-bouts, and wide bottom bout, with the bridge and F holes just below the middle. The top and back of the cello has <b>decorative</b> <b>border</b> inlay known as purfling. While purfling is attractive, it is also functional: if the instrument is struck, the purfling can prevent cracking of the wood. A crack may form at {{the rim of the}} instrument, but spreads no further. Without purfling, cracks can spread up or down the top or back. Playing, traveling and the weather all affect the cello and can increase a crack if purfling is not in place. Less expensive instruments typically have painted purfling.|$|E
25|$|Much of the altarpiece’s dynastic {{political}} power {{was derived from}} its decorative iconography. The most prominent dynastic icon featured in the altarpiece is the fleur-de-lys, {{the symbol of the}} French monarchy. The Angevins of Naples had descended from the French House of Capet and thus utilized the fleur-de-lys as their royal emblem. The fleur-de-lys motif is punched into the traditional Sienese gold ground, forming a <b>decorative</b> <b>border</b> around Simone Martini’s main panel. The frame of the altarpiece is painted a deep blue and decorated with large gold fleurs-de-lys, modelled in deep relief. Below the frame is a predella in which Simone Martini painted five scenes from the life of Saint Louis of Toulouse. This would have proved challenging for Simone as Saint Louis had just been canonized, requiring him to invent a new set of iconography. These scenes function as both religious and dynastic icons by depicting the miracles of a saint from the Angevin dynasty. Two additional dynastic icons can be observed on the clasp of St Louis’s cope: the red and yellow heraldic colors of Provence and the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. By presenting these two territories, both claimed by the Angevins, Simone has revealed the extent of Robert of Anjou’s political reach.|$|E

2500|$|She {{completed}} her purchases by ordering glassware. [...] She purchased the glassware on July 3, 1861, from A. P. Zimaudy of Washington, D.C. [...] This $1,500 set of glassware was richly cut and one side inscribed with the U.S. coat of arms. The glassware was manufactured by Christian Dorflinger, a {{company based in}} Brooklyn, New York, and was much thinner and lighter than the typical White House heavy crystal which had been used since the Andrew Jackson administration. [...] Small flowers were depicted on the sides and backs of the glassware. [...] A <b>decorative</b> <b>border</b> of umbrella-like shapes was etched into the lip, and the base featured a star and fan of spreading rays. The exact content of the glassware order is not clear, but probably included four dozen complete settings (water glass, red wine glass, white wine glass, champagne flute, dessert wine glass, and all-purpose glass) {{as well as some}} serving dishes. White House glassware historian Jane Shadel Spillman believes the glassware collection was probably similar to a [...] "presentation" [...] set given to Japanese diplomats by E.V. Haughwout the year before. This presentation set included goblets, champagne glasses, wine glasses, claret glasses, green-tinted hock glasses, cordial glasses, quart- and pint-size decanters, claret decanters, bowls, side dishes, finger bowls, and saltcellars. The setting also probably included punch bowls, double-handled punch cups, ice cream plates, carafes, sugar bowls, and celery vases. Among the known serving dishes were a relish dish and a compote dish.|$|E
