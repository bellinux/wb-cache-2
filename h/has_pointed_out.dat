5|$|While {{some critics}} have feared the {{revision}} of the Champagne region is about expanding production irrespective of quality, British wine writer and Champagne expert Tom Stevenson <b>has</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that the proposed additions constitute a consolidation rather than expansion.

5|$|Additionally, John Maynard Smith, a noted {{biologist}} with {{a strong}} background in aeronautics, <b>has</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that bumblebees would {{not be expected to}} sustain flight, as they would need to generate too much power given their tiny wing area. However, in aerodynamics experiments with other insects, he found that viscosity at the scale of small insects meant even their small wings can move a very large volume of air relative to their size, and this reduces the power required to sustain flight by an order of magnitude.|$|E

5|$|Marine General Rathvon M. Tompkins, {{commander}} of the 3rd Marine Division, <b>has</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that had NVA actually intended to take Khe Sanh, North Vietnamese troops could have cut the Combat Base's sole source of water, a stream 500 meters outside {{the perimeter of the}} base. Had they simply contaminated the stream, the airlift would not have provided enough water to the Marines. Marine Lieutenant General Victor Krulak seconded the notion that there was never a serious intention to take the base by also arguing that neither the water supply nor the telephone land lines were ever cut by the North Vietnamese.|$|E
5|$|Business writer Megan Barnett <b>has</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> {{parallels}} between Dunder Mifflin and the real-life W.B. Mason paper company, based near Boston, in Brockton, Massachusetts. It is similarly regional in focus, serving corporate customers in New England and the Mid-Atlantic states. Like Dunder Mifflin, its original product line (rubber stamps) was {{something other than}} paper, and it faces stiff competition from national and international chains. It, too, has a branch office in Stamford, but Mason's has remained open. In 2009, it had an accounting scandal {{that resulted in a}} $545,000 payment to corporate customers, much as Dunder Mifflin {{had to deal with the}} arrest of Ryan Howard for fraud the year before.|$|E
5|$|Colin Renfrew <b>has</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> {{the dangers}} of {{applying}} modern values of art to past societies and cultures. GÃ¼nter Berghaus argues that these works have often been approached {{with a set of}} post-Renaissance aesthetic values that distinguish between artists and craftsman and art and artifact, although these categories are not universal and may be inappropriate for understanding prehistoric society. Duncan Garrow has pointed to the difficulties of the modern distinction drawn between form and decoration. The emphasis in studies of prehistoric art tend to be placed on decoration in objects such as ceramics and ignores the importance of form, found in objects such as weapons.|$|E

5|$|In many {{accounts}} {{of the development of}} evolutionary theory, Wallace is mentioned only in passing as simply being the stimulus to the publication of Darwin's own theory. In reality, Wallace developed his own distinct evolutionary views which diverged from Darwin's, and was considered by many (especially Darwin) to be a leading thinker on evolution in his day, whose ideas could not be ignored. One historian of science <b>has</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that, through both private correspondence and published works, Darwin and Wallace exchanged knowledge and stimulated each other's ideas and theories over an extended period. Wallace is the most-cited naturalist in Darwin's Descent of Man, occasionally in strong disagreement.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862, was {{the single}} bloodiest day in American {{military}} history. The outnumbered Confederate forces fought desperately and well. Despite significant advantages in manpower, McClellan was unable to concentrate his forces effectively, which meant that Lee was able to shift his defenders to parry each of three Union thrusts, launched separately and sequentially against the Confederate left, center, and finally the right. McClellan was also unwilling, due to Porter's opinion, to employ his ample reserve forces to capitalize on localized successes. Historian James M. McPherson <b>has</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that the two corps McClellan kept in reserve were in fact larger than Lee's entire force. The reason for McClellan's reluctance was that, as in previous battles, he was convinced he was outnumbered.|$|E
5|$|There {{is little}} {{evidence}} for military action during Nyuserre's reign. William C. Hayes proposed that a few fragmentary limestone statues of kneeling and bound prisoners of war discovered in his mortuary temple possibly attest to punitive raids in Libya to the west or the Sinai and Palestine to the east during his reign. The art historian William Stevenson Smith <b>has</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> that such statues were customary elements of the decoration of royal temples and mastabas, suggesting {{that they may not}} be immediately related to actual military campaigns. Similar statues and small wooden figures of kneeling captives were discovered in the mortuary complexes of Neferefre, Djedkare Isesi, Unas, Teti, Pepi I and Pepi II {{as well as in the}} tomb of vizier Senedjemib Mehi.|$|E

5|$|Australian ravens begin {{breeding}} {{once they}} are three years old. Breeding season is from July to September, with no substantial difference in timing across its range around the country despite it inhabiting a range of diverse climates and habitats across 19 degrees of latitude. Rowley <b>has</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> this is unusual for a bird species {{with a wide range}} and has postulated that breeding is initiated by day length. Rarely, breeding can take place in May, June or October. Australian ravens generally nest in tall trees, never near to the ground as some species do. The nest also functions as a lookout post and so tall or emergent trees are selected. The ravens occasionally nest on buildings, telegraph poles, or tall windmills which allow the species to occupy areas lacking in tall trees. Windmills may have assisted the spread of the species in North Queensland and the Northern Territory. The highest recorded corvid nest in Australia was found atop the AWA Tower in Sydney.|$|E
5|$|GRCs {{have been}} criticized as {{creating}} unequal voting powers between electors. At present, one vote in a GRC ward returns five or six candidates into Parliament, compared with one vote in a SMC ward, which only returns one candidate. The GRC scheme has also diluted electors' voting power. For instance, in an SMC ward there are around 14,000 voters, compared to 140,000 voters in a five- or six-member GRC. Thus, the power of each vote in a GRC is lower than in an SMC, as each voter in a GRC finds it harder to vote out an MP {{that he or she}} does not like. The situation is {{compounded by the fact that}} a 30% deviation from equality of electoral divisions is tolerated. Another commentator <b>has</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that the current MP-to-voter guide ratio is one MP to 26,000 voters, which implies that the number of voters in an electoral division can vary between 18,200 and 33,800. By extrapolation, a five-member GRC can have between 91,000 and 169,000 voters, a difference of 86%.|$|E
5|$|The Earl of Oxford, {{commanding}} {{the right wing}} of the Neville army, broke the opposing Yorkist line, under William, Lord Hastings, early in the battle. Oxford's men proceeded to chase the fleeing soldiers, and ended up looting away from the battlefield. Oxford managed to regroup his men, but, returning to the battlefield, as James Ross has put it, 'disaster struck.' In the time he and his force had been absent, the line of battle had shifted almost ninety degrees, so instead of returning to attack Edward's rear, he crashed into Montagu's section. The fog prevented identification, and Oxford's men fought with Montagu's. Montagu may, one chronicler suggests, have mistakenly seen Oxford's 'Streaming star' banner as the king's 'Sunne in splendour,' and thus believe that the Earl had gone over to York. Recently though, one historian <b>has</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that, in fact, Oxford had never previously used such a cognizance, and it was more prosaically just a case of men confused by fog.|$|E

5|$|The {{day after}} Clifford's death {{the bulk of}} the Yorkist and Lancastrian armies faced each other at the Battle of Towton. After what is now {{considered}} the biggest and possibly bloodiest battle ever to take place on English soil, the Lancastrians were routed, and the son of the duke of York was crowned King Edward IV. On 4 November 1461, at Edward's first parliament, Clifford was attainted and his estates and barony forfeited to the king; a large portion were later granted to the earl of Warwick. The storyâ which would later be repeated by George Edward Cokayne in his Complete Peerageâ of how Clifford's widow, fearing her son, Henry, would be slain in retaliation for Rutland's death, sent him into hiding as a shepherd, is almost certainly a folklore. As Dr James Ross <b>has</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> the young Henry Clifford was pardoned in 1472, and as early as 1466 was named publicly as receiving a bequest, although Ross does suggest that Henry may well have gone into hiding for a time from his father's enemies.|$|E
5|$|II. Adagio in A-flat major, AâBâAâBâA form. Nostalgic in its {{traditional}} classical character (one {{of the few}} instrumental adagios Schubert wrote), the opening theme of this movement is an elegant, touching melody that eventually undergoes remarkable tonal and cadential treatment, undermining the peaceful setting. Charles Fisk <b>has</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that the voice-leading of the first phrase, 1â7â1â2â3â4â3, {{is based on the}} initial A-flat digression {{in the beginning of the}} Allegro. The unorthodox, chromatic harmonic structure of this movement is generated from a short progression that appears towards the end of the A section, leading to a plagal cadence in the subdominant key (D-flat), chromatically colored with its own minor subdominant chord (G-flat minor). The importance of this progression and of D-flat in general is emphasized by its quotation in a climax of the finale's exposition. This diversion of the main theme's expected cadence leads to the haunted atmosphere of the B section, which is full of chromatic modulations and startling sforzandos. In the second appearance of the A and B sections, almost the entire music is shifted a semitone up, further cementing the importance of the ascending minor 2nd in the sonata as a whole. The focal plagal progression returns transformed at the end of the movement, with even subtler chromatic coloration and more distant modulations, touching on C major, before the piece finally ends in the tonic, the theme now weakened and given an illusory quality due to the evasion of cadences, free modulation, and tendency toward digression into troubled minor passages.|$|E
5|$|IV. Rondo: Allegretto â Presto. This lyrical rondo {{movement}} {{consists of}} flowing triplet movement and endless songful melody. Its form is a sonata-rondo (AâBâAâdevelopmentâAâBâAâcoda). The Rondo's main and opening theme {{is taken from}} the slow movement of the sonata D. 537 of 1817. Charles Fisk <b>has</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that this theme would make musical sense as a response subsequent to the questioning leading tone that closes the Allegro's opening fanfare; in this capacity the Rondo's lyricism is the dramatically delayed final goal of the sonata. The second thematic group is written in the traditional dominant key; however, it is very long, modulating through many different subdominant tonalities. The development section, in contrast, culminates in a long passage in C-sharp minor with a climax characterized by a tension-building ambiguity between E major and C-sharp minor and a greatly prolonged evasion of a cadence. This leads to a false recapitulation in F-sharp major, which then modulates to begin again in the home key. In the coda, the main theme returns fragmented, with full bar pauses, which lead each time to unexpected changes of key. This is followed by an agitated presto section, based on the final bars of the main theme, and the sonata concludes with a bold evocation of its very opening measures, with an ascending arpeggio (essentially an inversion of the descending figure from the Allegro's second phrase), followed by a fortissimo full statement of the opening fanfare in retrograde.|$|E

5|$|Pontoon bridge: The Zhou Dynasty Chinese {{text of the}} Shi Jing (Book of Odes) {{records that}} King Wen of Zhou {{was the first to}} create a pontoon bridge in the 11th century BC. However, the British scientist, sinologist and {{historian}} Joseph Needham <b>has</b> <b>pointed</b> <b>out</b> that in all likely scenarios, the temporary pontoon bridge was invented during the 9th or 8th century BC in China, as this part was perhaps a later addition to the book (considering how the book had been edited up until the Han Dynasty, 202 BC220 AD). Although earlier temporary pontoon bridges had been made in China, the first secure and permanent ones (and linked with iron chains) in China came first during the Qin Dynasty (221 BC207 BC). The later Song Dynasty (9601279 AD) Chinese statesman Cao Cheng once wrote a description of the early pontoon bridges in China. During the Eastern Han Dynasty (25220 AD), the Chinese created a very large pontoon bridge that spanned across the width of the Yellow River. There was also the rebellion of Gongsun Shu in 33 AD, where a large pontoon bridge with fortified posts was constructed across the Yangtze River, eventually broken through with ramming ships by official Han troops under Commander Cen Peng. During the late Eastern Han into the Three Kingdoms period, during the Battle of Chibi in 208 AD, the Prime Minister Cao Cao once linked the majority of his fleet together with iron chains, which proved to be a fatal mistake once he was thwarted with a fire attack by Sun Quan's fleet. The armies of Emperor Taizu of Song had a large pontoon bridge built across the Yangtze River in 974 in order to secure supply lines during the Song Dynasty's conquest of the Southern Tang.|$|E
