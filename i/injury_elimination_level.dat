40|$|Background: Although disability-free life {{expectancy}} {{has been investigated}} in Japan, gains from elimination of diseases and injuries have not been examined. Methods: We used data from the 2007 Japanese national health statistics to calculate {{the number of years}} with and without activity limitation that could be expected from eliminating 6 selected diseases and injuries. Results: At birth, the number of expected years of life without and with activity limitation was 70. 8 and 8. 4, respectively, in males and 74. 2 and 11. 8 in females. More than 1. 0 expected years without activity limitation were gained from eliminating malignant neoplasms and cerebrovascular diseases; smaller gains were observed after eliminating other diseases and <b>injuries.</b> <b>Elimination</b> of cerebrovascular diseases, dementia, and fracture decreased expected years with activities of daily living (ADL) limitation, and elimination of shoulder lesions/low back pain decreased expected years with non-ADL limitation. Conclusions: Elimination of diseases and injuries increased expected years with and without activity limitation among Japanese, which suggests that improved prevention of those diseases and injuries—including cerebrovascular diseases and dementia—would result in longer disability-free {{life expectancy}} and fewer years of severe disability...|$|R

40|$|A {{comparative}} study {{of the two most}} widely used commercial peroxidases (E. C. 1. 11. 1. 7) for removing 4 -chlorophenol from aqueous industrial effluents is presented. Both the peroxidases tested, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and soybean peroxidase (SBP), showed maximal removal efficiency in a neutral pH medium although they maintained more than 70 % of their activity in a pH range of between 6. 0 and 8. 0. The influence of temperature on the <b>elimination</b> <b>levels</b> was negligible between T = 25 and 40 °C for both enzymes. To minimize the treatment period and enzyme dose, the effect of adding different amounts of a protective agent (polyethylene glycol, PEG) was explored.

After antigen (bovine serum albumin, BSA) <b>elimination,</b> <b>levels</b> of serum IgE and in vitro basophil degranulation in the presence of BSA were determined. The results showed that the onset of glomerular lesions depends upon the simultaneous occurrence of circulating immune complexes greater than 19 S and of an in vivo basophil depletion [...] probably equivalent to degranulation [...] reaching 70 % of the pre-disease number. Post-disease antigen-dependent in vitro degranulation of the basophils and levels of serum IgE anti BSA did not prove to be good indexes of basophil sensitization. Our data suggest that basophils are instrumental at early stages of the deposition of immune complexes, most probably through their sensitization by membrane-bound IgE antibodies...|$|R

40|$|A {{flight control}} system's {{task is to}} process and {{distribute}} signals under real time conditions. Such a flight control system has to be extremely reliable and still be capable of tolerating arbitrary faults. A flight control computer system consists of several autonomous processing-units, the so-called nodes. A time-independant model was developed to abstract the communication messages of the flight control system. This model is used to identify system assumptions, characteristic features and their relationship assuming arbitrary faults. A node has the 'jurisdiction to isolate other nodes' and is itself failure-propagation-boundary and thus potential <b>elimination</b> <b>level.</b> If a node is clearly identified as being faulty on the local level, the desire to isolate the node {{is sent to the}} so-called isolators, which will reconfigure the flight control system if a certain amount of other nodes are in agreement. It is proven that 'isolating' flight control systems do not require stronger minimal redundancy level constraints than ordinary 'masking' flight control systems. (orig.)

40|$|It is well {{recognised}} that reducing positive end {{expiratory pressure}} (PEEP) {{leads to an}} increase in the tidal volume and minute volume in ventilated neonates. The magnitude of this effect is perhaps not commonly appreciated, however. Effectively, PEEP is four times as potent as peak inflation pressure (PIP) in bringing about changes in tidal volume. The influence of changes in PEEP and PIP on tidal volume and the relative magnitude of each are considered. Twenty one preterm infants were studied on 38 separate occasions. All were sedated, paralysed, and ventilated, 19 for hyaline membrane disease. A 1 cm H 2 O reduction in PEEP was twice as potent as a 2 cm H 2 O increase in PIP in achieving an increase in tidal volume (14 v 7 %). Similarly, increasing PEEP by 1 cm H 2 O was twice as effective as a 2 cm H 2 O decrease in PIP in reducing tidal volume (13 v 6 %). Small (0. 5 - 1 cm H 2 O) changes in PEEP can often be used to improve ventilation and carbon dioxide <b>elimination.</b> <b>Levels</b> of PEEP of 4 - 5 cm H 2 O may, at times, impair gas exchange and contribute to overdistension...|$|R
40|$|Background: National Leprosy Eradication Program (NLEP) was {{launched}} in 1983 {{with the goal of}} elimination of leprosy as a public health problem. Aim: To evaluate the NLEP performance after integration into general health system from April 2003 to March 2014. Material and Methods: A retrospective record based study was conducted by obtaining data from Rajkot district leprosy center. Prevalence rate (PR), new case detection rate (NCDR), proportion of female cases, child cases, multibacillary (MB) cases, Grade II disability among new cases and release from treatment (RFT) cases were evaluated from April 2003 to March 2014 and analyzed by using Chi-square for trend analysis test. Results: The PR of leprosy per 10, 000 populations was significantly declined (P 0. 05). The proportion of child cases also showed significantly declining trend from 12. 08 % in 2003 - 2004 to 6. 70 % in 2013 - 2014 (P 0. 05). Proportion of patients RFT showed fluctuation from 66. 66 % (2003 - 2004) to 45. 68 % (2009 - 2010) and then 64. 66 % (2013 - 2014) (P < 0. 001).

In this study we explored potential socioeconomic, medical and demographic factors which could influence the propensity of family members for measles vaccination schedule. A cross-sectional study was performed through a questionnaire administered {{to the parents of}} children who received the first dose of MMR vaccine in two different vaccination centers in the Palermo area from November 2012 to May 2013. Overall, the role played by internet (OR 19. 8 P = 0. 001) and the large number of children in a family (OR 7. 3 P ≤ 0. 001) were the factors more associated to be unvaccinated, whereas the birth order of the child (OR 0. 3 P =< 0. 05 for the oldest children vs. the closer young one) and reporting a lack of MMR vaccination as a "personal decision" (OR 0. 19 P ≤ 0. 01) inversely correlated with the risk of quitting vaccination. These findings can be useful for a better knowledge of disaffection to vaccination practice in local settings and could contribute to improve and maintain timely uptake, suggesting approaches to optimize the uptake of MMR tailored to the needs of local populations...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} tuberculosis (TB) incidence {{rates and}} trends {{over a period}} of 20 years (1991 - 2010) and assess the impact of the National TB Control Program (NTP) on incidence trends. Methods: This is a retrospective study of TB surveillance data reported by the Ministry of Health. We evaluated TB incidence data by nationality, age, and region of the country and assessed incidence trends over 20 years of study. Chi-squared test was used to assess trend change and its significance. Results: There were a total of 64, 345 reported TB cases over the study period. Of these 48 % were Non-Saudis. TB annual incidence rate ranged between 14 and 17 / 100, 000. For Saudis, the rate ranged between 8. 6 and 12. 2 / 100, 000. Non-Saudis had 2 - 3 times higher incidence. Disease trend was rising over the first 10 years of the study period then it started to fall slightly. The incidence increased with age, but only people older than 45 years showed a declining trend. Regional variations were observed. Makkah and Jazan regions had the highest incidence rates. Disease trends were rising over the last 10 years in Makkah and Central regions. Conclusion: TB control seems to be facing some challenges in several regions of the Kingdom.

We hypothesized that during lung repair, signals capable of inducing {{the death of}} the two principal cellular elements of granulation tissue, fibroblasts and endothelial cells, would be present at the air-lung interface. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid obtained from patients during lung repair induced both fibroblast and endothelial cell death, while fluid obtained at the time of injury or from patient controls did not. The mode of cell death for endothelial cells was apoptosis. Fibroblast death, while morphologically distinct from necrosis, also differed from typical apoptosis. Only proliferating cells were susceptible to the bioactivities in lavage fluid, which were trypsin sensitive and lipid insoluble. Histological examination of lung tissue from patients after lung injury revealed evidence of apoptotic cells within airspace granulation tissue. Our results suggest that cell death induced by peptide(s) present at the air-lung interface may participate in the remodeling process that accompanies tissue repair after injury...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to extract {{cellulosic}} fibres from the Esparto grass (Stipa Tenacissima L.) for being used in textile applications. This material is renewable, biodegradable and very ecological. In fact, it requires very little amount of water to grow and neither insecticides nor pesticides are needed. In this work, three methods have been used to extract and obtain the Alfa fibres. These inquiries involve the study of the Alfa undergoing them only to an initial mechanical treatment (α 1 fibres); adding to it, a chemical treatment using NaOH 3 N (α 2 fibres) and, finally, an enzymatic treatment is incorporated to the mechanical and alkali treatments (α 3 fibres). The effects of these treatments on the fibres have been studied by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Fourier Transformation InfraRed (FTIR), linear density, density, moisture regain, tensile test, water absorption, contact angle and X-ray diffraction. It has been observed that both (α 2) and (α 3) fibres have promising results, SEM images and FTIR spectra show the <b>elimination</b> <b>level</b> of the non-cellulosic components presents in the stems. Pectinase used in the last extraction have a supplementary cleaning up effect. It was found using X-Ray diffraction that cristallinity index increases after treatments, this effect is due to the partial elimination of the amorphous cellulose and the removal of the non cellulosic material during the treatment. The tensile properties were obtained from single filament tensile test, resulting in values similar to those of natural fibres like Agave or Sisal [12]. It has been observed also that (α 2) fibres have a tensile strength and Young modulus higher than which are obtained with (α 3) fibres...|$|R

40|$|Background: Focal {{screening}} and treatment (FSAT) of malaria infections {{has recently been}} introduced in Peru to overcome the inherent limitations of passive case detection (PCD) and further decrease the malaria burden. Here, we used a relatively straightforward mathematical model to assess the potential of FSAT as elimination strategy for Plasmodium falciparum malaria in the Peruvian Amazon Region. Methods: A baseline model was developed to simulate a scenario with seasonal malaria transmission {{and the effect of}} PCD and treatment of symptomatic infections on the P. falciparum malaria transmission in a low endemic area of the Peruvian Amazon. The model was then adjusted to simulate intervention scenarios for predicting the long term additional impact of FSAT on P. falciparum malaria prevalence and incidence. Model parameterization was done using data from a cohort study in a rural Amazonian community as well as published transmission parameters from previous studies in similar areas. The effect of FSAT timing and frequency, using either microscopy or a supposed field PCR, was assessed on both predicted incidence and prevalence rates. Results: The intervention model indicated that the addition of FSAT to PCD significantly reduced the predicted P. falciparum incidence and prevalence. The strongest reduction was observed when three consecutive FSAT were implemented {{at the beginning of the}} low transmission season, and if malaria diagnosis was done with PCR. Repeated interventions for consecutive years (10 years with microscopy or 5 years with PCR), would allow reaching near to zero incidence and prevalence rates. Conclusions: The addition of FSAT interventions to PCD may enable to reach P. falciparum <b>elimination</b> <b>levels</b> in low endemic areas of the Amazon Region, yet the progression rates to those levels may vary substantially according to the operational criteria used for the intervention...|$|R
