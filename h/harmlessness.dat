In May 1886, swimming instructor Robert Emmet Odlum died in an attempt to prove the <b>harmlessness</b> of falling long distances through the air. A month later, Steve Brodie was said to have successfully dropped from the bottom of the bridge and survived with injuries, but doubts about whether he actually made the jump surfaced years later and the matter remains unsettled.|$|E
25|$|The {{principle}} of non-violence seeks to minimize karmas which limit {{the capabilities of}} the soul. Jainism views every soul as worthy of respect because {{it has the potential to}} become Siddha (God in Jainism). Because all living beings possess a soul, great care and awareness is essential in one's actions. Jainism emphasizes the equality of all life, advocating <b>harmlessness</b> towards all, whether the creatures are great or small. This policy extends even to microscopic organisms. Jainism acknowledges that every person has different capabilities and capacities to practice and therefore accepts different levels of compliance for ascetics and householders.|$|E

Against Middlesex, he took ten for 63, and against Surrey twelve for 108. However, his <b>harmlessness</b> on the best pitch of the season at The Oval made {{sure that he was}} not chosen for The Ashes tour that winter. 1895 was disappointing as a batsman and bowler, but his fielding made him a vital member of Yorkshire's eleven. In the dry summer of 1896, he recaptured his ability to exploit the few sticky wickets, and got closer to a thousand runs than ever before.|$|E
500|$|The Supreme Court of the United States has {{identified}} {{a narrow range}} of errors that require automatic reversal; for all other errors, the decision of a lower court will be upheld if the error was harmless. In 1967, the Supreme Court ruled in Chapman v. California that a constitutional error will only be considered harmless when the court is [...] "able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt". Additionally, when reviewing federal habeas corpus petitions, a petitioner must demonstrate that an error [...] "had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict". The Supreme Court has also ruled that when reviewing a determination of <b>harmlessness</b> under Chapman, the AEDPA mandates that the reviewing court may not grant a petition for habeas corpus [...] "unless the <b>harmlessness</b> determination itself was unreasonable". According to the Supreme Court, the rationale underlying this doctrine is the public policy concern that states courts should {{not be forced to}} undertake the [...] "arduous task" [...] of retrying criminal defendants [...] "based on mere speculation that the defendant was prejudiced by trial error".|$|E
500|$|A {{major theme}} of the {{dictator}} novel concerns the use of writing as a medium of power. In , Asturias uses language to challenge dictatorial power. Throughout the novel the reader observes {{the authority of the}} President over the people through his control of what they write. In the chapter [...] "The President's Mail-Bag", a stream of letters informs the President of peoples' actions. While many are [...] "writing the truth" [...] and turning in their fellow citizens, many others feel that [...] "it is not safe to trust to paper". Writing is closely linked to authority and is a means to solidify power, because language can be manipulated into lies that eventually kill. For example, the President orders a newspaper to include the false statement that he attended the wedding of Camila, the daughter of General Canales. When the General reads these words and perceives them as truth, his heart is broken and he subsequently dies. Miguel Angel Face is also killed by the manipulation of words: he is told that Camila has become the President's mistress, and upon hearing this falsified news, he loses the will to live. These episodes in the novel demonstrate how closely language, the written word, and power are linked. The characters in [...] lose their sense of reality, making {{it difficult for them to}} know who to trust. As Rosello argues, [...] "in this state of terror, language is deliberately used as a means of seducing the addressee into <b>harmlessness,</b> and has lost its function of conveying information".|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "nonviolence" [...] {{is often}} linked with or {{used as a}} synonym for peace, and despite being {{frequently}} equated with passivity and pacifism, this is rejected by nonviolent advocates and activists. Nonviolence refers specifically {{to the absence of}} violence and is always the choice to do no harm or the least harm, and passivity is the choice to do nothing. [...] Sometimes nonviolence is passive, and other times it isn't. For example, if a house is burning down with mice or insects in it, the most harmless appropriate action is to put the fire out, not to sit by and passively let the fire burn. There is at times confusion and contradiction written about nonviolence, <b>harmlessness</b> and passivity. A confused person may advocate nonviolence in a specific context while advocating violence in other contexts. For example, someone who passionately opposes abortion or meat eating may concurrently advocate violence to kill an abortionist or attack a slaughterhouse, which makes that person a violent person.|$|E

With regard to her question, he declared that in his judgment no human being could answer it. He thought that upon the whole the balance of probabilities turned in her favor. Winterborne's apparent strength, during the last months of his life, must have been delusive.

In many places the seams of his garments had parted across the bulges of body. His calves grew into his feet, for the broken elastic sides of his Congress gaiters were swelled full with the fat of him. One arm only he sported, from the shoulder of which was suspended a small and tattered bundle with the mud caked dry on the outer covering from the last place he had pitched his doss.

60|$|I {{therefore}} urge this head, {{not because}} I {{would have little}} sinners go and tell God that they are little sinners, thereby to think to obtain his mercy; for, verily, so they are never like to have it; for such words declare, that such an one hath no true sense {{at all of the}} nature of his sins. Sin, as I said, in the nature of it, is horrible, though it be but one single sin as to act; yea, though it be but a sinful thought; and so worthily calls for the damnation of the soul. The comparison, then, of little and great sinners, is to go for good sense among men.

And said, moreover, that to cut off all occasions of suspicion from any, as touching the <b>harmlessness</b> of my doctrine in private, I would willingly take the pains to give any one the notes of all my sermons; for I do sincerely desire to live quietly in my country, and to submit to the present authority.|$|E

They explained as well as they might, and at a suggestion which Kenton made through Breckon, they admitted that it was not beside their duty to take Boyne directly to a magistrate, who could pass upon his case, and even release him upon proper evidence of his <b>harmlessness,</b> and sufficient security for any demand that justice might make for his future appearance.|$|E

60|$|Any one {{who will}} look around upon the {{families}} of his acquaintance will observe that family characteristics and resemblances prevail not only in respect to stature, form, expression of countenance, and other outward and bodily tokens, but also {{in regard to the}} constitutional temperaments and capacities of the soul. Sometimes we find a group in which high intellectual powers and great energy of action prevail for many successive generations, and in all the branches into which the original stock divides; in other cases, the hereditary tendency is to gentleness and <b>harmlessness</b> of character, with a full development of all the feelings and sensibilities of the soul. Others, again, exhibit congenital tendencies to great physical strength and hardihood, and to powers of muscular exertion and endurance. These differences, notwithstanding all the exceptions and irregularities connected with them, are obviously, where they exist, deeply seated and permanent. They depend very slightly upon any mere external causes. They have, on the contrary, their foundation in some hidden principles connected with the origin of life, and with the mode of its transmission from parent to offspring, which the researches of philosophers have never yet been able to explore.|$|E

The {{flattened}} wheel of the trolley, banging the track day and night, and tormenting the waking and sleeping ear, was, oddly enough, the inspiration of reforms which have made our city the quietest in the world. The trolleys now pass unheard; the elevated train glides by overhead with only a modulated murmur; the subway is a retreat fit for meditation and prayer, where the passenger can possess his soul in a peace to be found nowhere else; the automobile, which was unknown in the day of the Altrurian Emissary, whirs softly through the most crowded thoroughfare, far below the speed limit, with a sigh of gentle satisfaction in its own <b>harmlessness,</b> and, [...] "like the sweet South, taking and giving odor."

From end to end it was a festering mass of corruption, overshadowed by incredible swarms of flies. Yet the engineer who could face evil sights and nauseous smells was repaid by an inspection of the deep narrow trenches in which a rifleman could crouch with the minimum danger from shells, and the caves in which the non-combatants remained in absolute safety.

With daylight a fine advance was begun, the brigade moving up in very extended order and the mounted men turning the right flank of the defence.
