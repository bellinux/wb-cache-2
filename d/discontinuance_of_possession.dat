Except for the introductory part and the conclusion, the thesis {{is divided into three}} main chapters. The first chapter is devoted to the concept of restorative justice and deals also with a concept of divergences. In addition to the definition of the divergence the thesis addresses adequately particular types of divergences as they appear in Czech criminal proceedings. The core of the thesis shall be found in the chapter number two, which provides {{a closer look at the}} conditional <b>discontinuance</b> <b>of</b> criminal prosecution itself.
