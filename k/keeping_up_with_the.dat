However, operational difficulties when stopping for water tended to lose any time advantages gained and affected the published performance figures.

5|$|Interceptor {{aircraft}} with ever-improving performance {{remained the}} only effective anti-bomber weapons {{by the early}} 1950s, and even these were having problems <b>keeping</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> latest designs; Soviet interceptors during the late 1950s could not intercept the high-altitude U-2 reconnaissance aircraft, {{in spite of its}} relatively low speeds.

In the special, which aired in May 2015, the point was emphasized {{that there is no}} one right way to transition. Jenner made it a priority to ensure that all her children were independent first before focusing on her transition. In September 2015, her name was legally changed to Caitlyn Marie Jenner and gender to female.|$|E

5|$|Music {{composer}} James Horner {{felt he was}} {{not given}} enough time to create a musical score. Horner arrived in England and expected the film to write the score in six weeks, which {{he thought was a}} sufficient amount of time. Horner, however, discovered that filming and editing were still taking place, and he was unable to view the film. He visited the sets and editing rooms for three weeks and found that editor Ray Lovejoy was barely <b>keeping</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> workload for reasons of time restrictions. Horner believed Cameron was preoccupied with sound effects, citing that Cameron spent two days with the sound engineer creating the sounds for the pulse rifles. He also complained that he was given an outdated recording studio; the score was recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios, a 30-year-old studio that was barely able to patch in synthesizers or use the electronic equipment that Horner required.|$|E

5|$|The tanks had {{difficulty}} <b>keeping</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> advance. One obstacle was mines. On the first day, the 2/7th Field Company lifted fourteen mines but a tractor broke a track running over a mine. On 7 December, two more tanks were damaged by mines, one beyond repair. The sappers then cut a new track which they corduroyed. To support {{the attack on}} Lakona, the tanks had to cross a creek with steep coral banks, swollen by a torrential downpour. While {{efforts were made to}} bring up a compressor, tanks fired into banks and holes were packed with explosives and detonated. On the evening of 16 December, the infantry were joined by five Matilda tanks, and overran the Japanese positions. They counted 47 Japanese dead; and killed another 17 in mopping-up operations the next day. On 20 December, aided by four Matilda tanks and 750 rounds from the 25-pounders, the 4th Infantry Brigade occupied the Fortification Point area. Between 5 and 20 December, the4th Infantry Brigade reported 65 killed and 136 wounded. Japanese casualties were 420 killed and 136 found dead, victims of disease, malnutrition and suicide.
