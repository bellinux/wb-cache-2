Work was then completed on the drum crusher and work area at Johnston Atoll for the transfer of HO from 55-gallon drums to an R-5 refueler truck, and later for transfer to the <b>incinerator</b> <b>ship.</b> The redrumming activity began on September 30, 1974. As a part of the effort to dispose of the HO stored at Johnston Atoll and Gulfport, Mississippi, an attempt was made to filter out the 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-dioxin (TCDD), using filters of coconut charcoal so that the Agents could be re-used or re-sold. [...] The twelve cylindrical filters used at Gulfport, Mississippi, contained approximately 13grams of the contaminant TCDD. They were transferred to Johnston Atoll on December 8, 1976, and were stored in Bunker 785 while awaiting final disposition. While the TCDD was successfully removed, the resultant filters created a disposal problem beyond current technology.|$|E

50|$|In 1966 the United States Defense Department {{claimed that}} {{herbicides}} used in Vietnam were not harmful to people or the environment. In 1972 it was advised that a known impurity precluded {{the use of}} these herbicides in Vietnam and all remaining stocks should be returned home. In 1977 the United States Air Force destroyed its stocks of Agent Orange 200 miles west of Johnston Island on the <b>incinerator</b> <b>ship</b> M/T Vulcanus. The impurity, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) was a suspected carcinogen that may have affected the health of over 17,000 United States servicemen, 4,000 Australians, 1,700 New Zealanders, Koreans, countless Vietnamese soldiers and civilians, and with over 40,000 children of veterans possibly suffering birth defects from herbicidal warfare.|$|E
50|$|The United States {{is similar}} to many {{countries}} which permit the spreading of cremation ashes within their Exclusive Economic zone - when spreading ashes from a ship which is registered in a different country, the regulations and reporting procedures for the ships flag state need to be complied with once the vessel is in international waters, that is, outside 12 nautical miles.Ships follow the London convention principles, as opposed to MARPOL regulations, as the ash is intentionally taken on board for discharge at sea, as opposed to ash generated on passage from the <b>ship's</b> <b>incinerators.</b> It should be further considered that on 1 January 2013, MARPOL Annex V came into force, which prevents discharge of a <b>ship's</b> <b>incinerator</b> ash.|$|R
5000|$|After World War II, DDG Hansa {{had lost}} all their ships to bombing and seizure by the Allies, and the {{headquarters}} building was demolished. From 1943 to 1969, the chairman was Hermann Helms (1898-1983), son of the previous chairman; he was succeeded in turn by his son, also Hermann Helms. In 1948, the company restarted, at first in shipwreck recovery and towing using barges, and then in 1950 resuming freight service to India and Persia with three secondhand ships. In 1956, the company had a fleet of 44 ships, mostly second-hand and new heavy freighters, sailing between Bremen, India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Burma, and the Persian Gulf. The company continued to {{have a reputation for}} innovation. The Lichtenfels-series of heavy freighters, beginning in 1954 with , were the first heavy lift ships equipped with the Stülcken derrick. They also had an unusual deck configuration, with the wheelhouse in the bow and the other superstructure aft, leading to the nickname 'Picasso ships'. Beginning in 1965, the company diversified into platform supply vessels, three years later making this a separate division, Offshore Supply Association (OSA), in partnership with VTG AG of Hamburg. The company also diversified into the container field, including experimentation with floating containers, and Roll-on/roll-off cargo haulage; Mariaeck and Brunneck, commissioned in 1968, could handle up to 800 tonnes of RoRo cargo, and in the 1970s DDG Hansa circumvented congestion problems at Persian Gulf and Red Sea ports by using large RoRo ships and its own terminals. Through subsidiaries, the company also owned and operated <b>incinerator</b> <b>ships</b> burning chemical waste, beginning with the [...] , built in 1977, operated worldwide carrying especially large and heavy loads and was the model for the John Henry and the Paul Bunyan of American Heavy Lift Shipping Company of Pittsburgh, and Hansa employees trained and assisted their crews. It was the world's largest heavy lift shipping company.|$|R

50|$|Celeste was {{responsible}} for damage to shipping and for causing high waves to hit Hawai'i. The biggest impact from the hurricane, however, was on Johnston Atoll. There, the hurricane caused damage to a meteorology station on the island as well as damaging several military installations, including those related to Program 437, an anti-satellite weapons system. Additionally, there was a threat of contamination on the island from stored Agent Orange and other herbicides brought from Vietnam by the Defense Department for eventual destruction at sea by the Dutch-owned <b>incinerator</b> <b>ship</b> MT Vulcanus. An inspection of the island following the hurricane {{indicated that there was}} no contamination, but the 1,800,000 gallons of herbicides sat in steel barrels on salt beaches for nearly 5 years. Overall, damage from the hurricane totalled $3.5 million.|$|E
50|$|Following Hansa's {{declaration}} of bankruptcy on August 18, 1980, the Vulcanus continued to operate until 1983, when it was overhauled at the Jurong shipyard in Singapore and equipped with a totally new forecastle equipping it to transport chemical waste. On May 4, 1983, the old forecastle was scrapped at Lien Ho Hsing Steel Enterprise Company in Kaohsiung. The rebuilt ship was again placed in service as an incinerator vessel, now under the name Vulcanus I. At the beginning of 1988, Waste Management, Inc., which had bought Vulcanus I and was then operating it and another <b>incinerator</b> <b>ship</b> named Vulcanus II, withdrew a longstanding application to provide offshore incineration of toxic wastes to the US market. Growing protests by environmental groups led to {{a decision by the}} Third International Conference on the Protection of the North Sea in 1990 to ban waste incineration in the North Sea from December 31, 1991. The decision was ratified on June 23, 1990, by the OSPAR Commission. Vulcanus I was then sold that year to the Danish shipping company M.H. Simonsen A.p.S. in Svendborg.|$|E

40|$|The Venice Lagoon {{is exposed}} to {{atmospheric}} pollutants from industrial activities, thermoelectric power plants, petrochemical plants, <b>incinerator,</b> domestic heating, <b>ship</b> traffic, glass factories and vehicular emissions on the mainland. In 2005, construction began on the mobile dams (MOSE), one dam for each channel connecting the lagoon to the Adriatic Sea as a barrier against high tide. These construction works could represent an additional source of pollutants. PM 10 samples were taken on random days between 2007 and 2010 at three different sites: Punta Sabbioni, Chioggia and Malamocco, located near the respective dam construction worksites. Chemical analyses of V, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Mo, Cd, Sb, Tl and Pb in PM 10 samples were performed by Inductively coupled plasmaquadrupole mass spectrometry (ICP-QMS) and results were used to identify the main aerosol sources. The correlation of measured data with meteorology, and source apportionment, failed to highlight a contribution specifically associated to the emissions of the MOSE construction works. The comparison of the measurements at the three sites showed a substantial homogeneity of metal concentrations in the area. Source apportionment with principal component analysis (PCA) and positive matrix factorization (PMF) showed that a four principal factors model could describe the sources of metals in PM 10. Three of them were assigned to specific sources {{in the area and}} one was characterised as a source of mixed origin (anthropogenic and crustal). A specific anthropogenic source of PM 10 rich in Ni and Cr, active at the Chioggia site, was also identified...|$|R
50|$|Beginning on February 11, 1972, the {{new owner}} had the ship {{converted}} into a waste <b>incinerator</b> <b>ship</b> at the K. A. van Brink shipyard in Rotterdam. Tanks for transportation of the waste were added, plus two incinerators located aft, in which the waste would be combusted at temperatures between 1300 and 1400° Celsius. On September 15, 1972, the shipyard delivered the completed ship to Vulcanus Shipping Pte. Ltd. in Singapore, which placed it in service as the Vulcanus. Management of the ship remained with Ocean Combustion Service; it was operated by Hansa Steamship Company of Bremen (Ocean Combustion Service and Vulcanus Shipping both being subsidiaries of Hansa). It was capable of incinerating 400 - 500 metric tons of waste a day, or approximately 100,000 metric tons a year. The ship primarily operated in the North Sea out of Rotterdam; in 1980 it and other incinerator ships were burning an estimated 80,000 metric tons of wastes including TCDD in the North Sea; but was also used on other routes. For example, in 1974, Shell Oil contracted to have liquid chlorinated hydrocarbon wastes from its Shell Chemical subsidiary incinerated in the Gulf of Mexico, and in 1977 in the South Pacific, Vulcanus disposed of more than 8 million liters of Agent Orange {{left over from the}} Vietnam War, in the U.S. Air Force Operation Pacer HO.|$|E
