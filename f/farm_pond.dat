5|$|Besides {{the main}} depot at the South Framingham junction, Framingham has been {{served by a}} number of {{stations}} inside or just outside its borders. The Agricultural Branch included three of these stations. One, variously known as Montwait, Mt. Wayte, and Lakeview, was located just north of Mt. Wayte Avenue {{at the north end of}} <b>Farm</b> <b>Pond.</b> The station served the Montwait neighborhood as well as the Montwait Camp Ground, a worship camp used by Methodist, Chautaqua, and later Pentecostal groups from the 1870s to the 1910s. The Framingham Centre station – at times known simply as Framingham – located at Maynard Street adjacent to Route 9. It was opened in 1849 when the branch to Framingham Center was completed. A new station was built in 1855 when the branch was realigned and extended. It also served the Framingham & Lowell after that line opened in 1871. A freight house and coal shed were located nearby to the north. Fayville station was located just over the Southborough border in the Fayville village and also served the western reaches of Framingham. The station was placed at Central Street between Route 9 and Route 30 at or after the 1855 opening of the line. The three stations closed with the end of passenger service on the branch in 1937; none of the buildings remain.|$|E

The county currently relies on the Shihmen Reservoir as the single water supply system. It will be of great concern in the shortage of water resources. This study aims to explore the impact of changes in <b>farm</b> <b>ponds</b> on the regional agricultural environment in Taoyuan County with multiyear (1993, 2003, and 2010) SPOT satellite imagery. Results show that <b>farm</b> <b>ponds</b> have decreased by 10. 55 million m 2 from 1993 to 2010, and the existing <b>farm</b> <b>ponds</b> were 18. 80 million m 2 in 2010, equivalent to the irrigation water of 21. 10 ~ 31. 65 million m 3 (tons) and 37. 61 ~ 56. 41 million m 3 (tons), respectively. The existing <b>farm</b> <b>ponds</b> are able to provide the water supply for 1. 88 ~ 2. 82 thousand hectares of agricultural land, accounting for 6. 70 %~ 10. 50 % of total agricultural area of Taoyuan County. Corresponding to the government’s promotion policy (2012) on activating fallow land, if we redeploy the existing <b>farm</b> <b>ponds</b> for activating fallow fields, it will lessen the water supply burden of Shimen Reservoir.

A {{comparison with}} natural wetlands This study shows {{the results of}} an extensive survey carried out in spring 2007 on 120 <b>farm</b> <b>ponds</b> in Andalusia (South of Spain). Pond use was diverse, but the most common uses were irrigation of vast areas of land and livestock watering. Zooplankton showed an unexpected richness in these previously unstudied water bodies which lie on private properties. A total of 103 taxa were identied (62 rotifera, 27 cladocera, 8 copepoda and 6 ostracoda). When results are compared with an extensive survey carried out {{at the same time in}} the protected wetlands of Andalusia, we found that there are many species exclusive to both the <b>farm</b> <b>ponds</b> and the protected wetlands. This suggests high complementary between articial and natural aquatic habitats, which highlight the role of <b>farm</b> <b>ponds</b> in biodiversity conservation. Furthermore, our results showed that <b>farm</b> <b>ponds</b> with natural substrate have a higher diversity and species richness of zooplankton than those with articial substrate. <b>Farm</b> <b>ponds</b> and other farming-related ecosystems are becoming important in both ecological and management studies, because they are increasing in landscapes all over the world.

40|$|In the past, farmers stored {{rainwater}} {{into the}} <b>farm</b> <b>ponds</b> for irrigation, {{on the other}} hand; its unrecoverable eco-environment and value of ecological transition were neglected usually. Moreover, the southwest area of Taiwan always lacks ground water for the influence of physical and chemistry, so it has many <b>farm</b> <b>ponds.</b> Therefore, this study focuses on researching {{the relation between the}} species distribution of <b>farm</b> <b>ponds</b> and the landscape structure at Neopu village in Tainan County. In this study, this research first follows the theory of landscape ecology to investigate birds, amphibians and reptiles on-site, to classify the land, and to operate the Geographic Information System. In addition, from the landscape structure index and the comparison of Pearson''s correlation coefficient, this research analyzes the connection with the types of <b>farm</b> <b>ponds</b> at mudstone area. Besides, for saving the preserve in the future, we maybe focus on the <b>farm</b> <b>ponds</b> that investigators can not be reached, and use the hot-spot diversity of ecology to preserve the <b>farm</b> <b>ponds</b> in order. This results shows that when the <b>farm</b> <b>ponds</b> had bigger area and more irregular contour, the birds, amphibious and reptile species had higher diversity. According to the related analysis of the <b>farm</b> <b>ponds</b> between class level of land use and the birds, amphibious and reptile species, farmland and road have influence their species. And there is an overall positive influence on ecological clustering in the forest land, meadow, mudstone area and water around <b>farm</b> <b>ponds.</b> The results also shows the effectiveness of landscape level index to the hot-spot of biodiversity. TA(Total Area) is primary, SHEI(Shannon''s Evenness Index) is the second, LNP(Landscape Patch Number) is the third. This result provides the reference resources in the <b>farm</b> <b>ponds</b> that ecological community the investigators is unable to reach. Finally, this research finds the hotspots of farm ponds' according to the analysis result. This strategy will help preventing <b>farm</b> <b>ponds</b> of biodiversity hotspots from disappearing due to the countryside construction, affecting the balance of ecosystem. Also, then obtains the goal of protecting the ecological variety and ecological balance at Neopu Village. 農塘為早期農民蓄積雨水所供給農業灌溉之用，其生態環境之不可回復性與生態過渡棲地價值卻時常被忽略，而台灣西南部泥岩地區受到理化性質影響而缺乏地下水，故農塘眾多，因此本研究以台南縣牛埔村泥岩地區農塘作為研究基地，探討農塘生物群聚與景觀結構間的關係。 本研究利用景觀生態學理論，首先進行現場鳥類及兩棲爬蟲類調查、土地利用分類及地理資訊系統之操作，藉由景觀結構指數計算、Pearson相關係數之比較，剖析泥岩農塘型態及其周邊土地利用與生物資源之關係。再者，因考量農塘之生物多樣性與生態平衡，常受到政策與經費影響無法進行全面性保育，因此利用生態多樣性熱點概念檢視農塘保育之優先順序，並探討熱點與景觀層級指數之判定係數，可將其應用在人力無法到達之農塘地點，以供未來保育區治理使用。 研究結果指出農塘面積越大、形狀越不規則，附近之鳥類與兩棲爬蟲類物種越多、數量越豐富和多樣性越高，同時也證明當農塘附近之兩棲爬蟲類多樣性越大且總數量越多，也會正面影響鳥類之多樣性和總數量。在農塘周邊土地利用類別層級與鳥類及兩棲爬蟲類之相關分析中，農地及道路確實有生態衝擊影響；林地、草地及水體皆對生態群聚有正面之影響；而在農塘周圍之泥岩裸露其相關性指出乃正面影響鳥類與兩棲爬蟲類之物種多樣性及總數量，因此區之泥岩周遭常伴隨著竹林地，且泥岩受雨水沖蝕之蝕溝地形，也可提供兩棲爬蟲類隱蔽空間。分析結果同時顯示景觀層級指數對生物多樣性熱點之影響力，以TA(全景觀面積) 為首要，其次為SHEI(Shannon均勻度指數) ，再者為LNP(總景觀塊區數) ，此結果將可作為調查人員較無法到達、可及性也較低之農塘生態群落情況參考依據。 最後，本研究依據分析找出牛輔村之農塘生態熱點，可將此概念避免因農村建設而導致重要生物多樣性熱點農塘消失，影響生態系平衡，達到保護牛埔村農塘生態多樣性與生態平衡之目的。目錄 	I 表目錄 	II 圖目錄 	III 壹、前言 	 1 一、研究動機 	 1 二、研究目的 	 2 貳、文獻回顧 	 3 一、景觀生態結構 	 3 二、航照影像與土地利用分類 	 16 三、島嶼生物地理學與生物多樣性熱點之關係 	 20 参、研究材料與方法 	 24 一、研究流程與限制 	 24 二、樣區概述 	 26 三、研究方法 	 31 肆、結果與討論 	 46 一、生物資料概述 	 46 二、景觀生態結構與生態資料相關分析 	 51 三、生物多樣性熱點分析 	 64 伍、結論與建議 	 70 一、結論 	 70 二、後續研究建議 	 71 參考文獻 	 72 附錄一、鳥類調查種類名錄 	 80 附錄二、鳥類調查種類及隻數 	 82 附錄三、兩棲爬蟲類調查種類名錄 	 84 附錄四、兩棲爬蟲類調查種類及隻數 	 85 附錄五、農塘周圍之土地利用分類數化結果 	 87 附錄六、農塘樣區之景觀生態結構指數值 	 9...|$|R

Two-liter water samples were returned to the laboratory for turbidity, Ca, K, Mg, P, N, and Si determinations (2, 3, 4). Diatom species diversity was measured (5, 6).

This involves stocking catfish at sufficiently low densities such that a pond is able to assimilate excess feed and fish wastes without needing supplemental aeration or chemicals to keep water quality from reaching toxic levels. This is "low-tech" aquaculture and requires little producer labor/management inputs. A mathematical model of extensive catfish culture in <b>farm</b> <b>ponds</b> was presented in this paper. This model used data from Kentucky where part-time producers, with a minimum of aquaculture experience and time for pond management, are involved in culturing catfish for retail/live markets. Results of this model showed that the optimal strategy would be to stock fish at densities up to 3, 000 /ha/yr (1, 200 /ac/yr). Other results showed that breakeven prices were less than $ 2. 20 /kg ($ 1. 00 /lb), a popular retail price for whole catfish.
