50|$|Macrobrachium rosenbergii, {{also known}} as the <b>giant</b> <b>river</b> <b>prawn</b> or giant {{freshwater}} prawn, is a commercially important species of palaemonid freshwater prawn. It is found throughout the tropical and subtropical areas of the Indo-Pacific region, from India to Southeast Asia and Northern Australia. The <b>giant</b> <b>river</b> <b>prawn</b> has also been introduced to parts of Africa, Thailand, China, Japan, New Zealand, the Americas and the Caribbean. It {{is one of the biggest}} freshwater prawns in the world and is widely cultivated in several countries for food. While M. rosenbergii is considered a freshwater species, the larval stage of the animal depends on brackish water. Once the individual shrimp has grown beyond the planktonic stage and becomes a juvenile, it will live entirely in freshwater.|$|E

Organic farming {{of rice and}} <b>giant</b> <b>river</b> <b>prawns</b> in rotational crops was tested in the waterlogged paddy fields of Kuttanad, Kerala {{as part of the}} Indian Organic Aquaculture Project. Rice was cultivated during November to February, followed by a crop of freshwater prawns in the same field from March to September. Here, we study the production of four certified farms growing organic rice and organic prawns compared with four conventional farms growing rice and prawns in rotational crops. We evaluate the economic viability by cost-return and partial budgeting analysis. Our results show that farming rice organically reduced yields by 23  %, from 5, 690  kg/ha in conventional farming compared to 4, 376  kg/ha in organic farming. However, the organic prawn crop yield of 396  kg/ha was 10  % higher than the yield of the conventional system, of 360  kg/ha, although the differences were not significant. Furthermore, total investment for organic rice was approximately 20  % greater than for the non-organic rice crop. Total investment for organic prawns was 17  % greater than for the non-organic prawn crop. Net revenue was 11  % lower for organic rice than for conventional rice. Organic prawns realized 117  % higher net revenue than conventional prawns. Although organic rice farming realized lower returns than conventional, its combination with organic prawn farming enhanced net revenue by 20  % over conventional rice/conventional prawn production...|$|R

50|$|Thai food {{is known}} for its {{enthusiastic}} use of fresh (rather than dried) herbs and spices. Common flavors in Thai food come from garlic, galangal, coriander/cilantro, lemon grass, shallots, pepper, kaffir lime leaves, shrimp paste, fish sauce, and chilies. Palm sugar, made from the sap of certain Borassus palms, is used to sweeten dishes while lime and tamarind contribute sour notes. Meats used in Thai cuisine are usually pork and chicken, and also duck, beef, and water buffalo. Goat and mutton are rarely eaten except by Muslim Thais. Game, such as wild boar, deer and wild birds, are now less common due to loss of habitat, the introduction of modern methods of intensive animal farming in the 1960s, and the rise of agribusinesses, such as Thai Charoen Pokphand Foods, in the 1980s. Traditionally, fish, crustaceans, and shellfish {{play an important role in}} the diet of Thai people. Anna Leonowens (of The King and I fame) observed in her book The English Governess at the Siamese Court (1870):"The stream is rich in fish of excellent quality and flavour, such as is found in most of the great rivers of Asia; and is especially noted for its platoo, a kind of sardine, so abundant and cheap that it forms a common seasoning to the labourer's bowl of rice."Freshwater varieties come from the many rivers, lakes, ponds, and paddy fields inland, and seafood from the tropical seas of the southern half of the country. Some species, such as the <b>giant</b> <b>river</b> <b>prawn,</b> need brackish water as juveniles but live out their lives in freshwater once mature. Aquaculture of species such as Nile tilapia, catfish, tiger prawns, and blood cockles, now generates a large portion of the seafood sold in, and exported from Thailand.|$|E

Research on gustavus gene expression will advance {{our understanding of the}} biological function of gustavus in animals. A cDNA encoding gustavus protein was identified and termed MnGus in the oriental <b>river</b> <b>prawn</b> Macrobrachium nipponense. Bioinformatic analyses showed that this gene encoded a protein of 262 amino acids and the protein belongs to the Spsb 1 family. Real-time quantitative PCR analyses revealed that the expression level of MnGus in prawn embryos was slightly higher at the cleavage stage than at the blastula stage, and reached the maximum level during the zoea stage of embryos. The minimum level of MnGus expression occurred during the perinucleolus stage in the ovary, while the maximum was at the oil globule stage, and then the level of MnGus expression gradually decreased with the advancement of ovarian development. The expression level of MnGus in muscle was much higher than that in other tissues in mature prawn. The gustavus cDNA sequence was firstly cloned from the oriental <b>river</b> <b>prawn</b> and the pattern of gene expression was described during oocyte maturation, embryonic development, and in other tissues.

Thus, {{it is important for}} new production systems to use practices that reduce environmental impacts, such as choosing to farm native species from a region's biological diversity and adopting better effluent management. This study aimed to estimate and compare environmental impacts of tropical freshwater prawn farming systems based either on the introduced species Macrobrachium rosenbergii (<b>giant</b> <b>river</b> <b>prawn)</b> or the native species Macrobrachium amazonicum (Amazon river prawn). The two hypothetical systems were compared using life cycle assessment (LCA) with the impact categories climate change, eutrophication, acidification, energy use, net primary production use, surface use and water dependence. Yields, species, feed conversation ratio (FCR) and feed processing were the factors with the most influence. The higher yield and lower FCR of <b>giant</b> <b>river</b> <b>prawn</b> induced lower impacts than native Amazon river prawn in all categories analyzed. Regardless of species, better effluent management in freshwater prawn farming, such as treating effluents with aquatic macrophytes or applying pond sediments to crops, significantly reduced eutrophication potential, making it extremely important to recommend using it in freshwater prawn farming.

Factor analysis and ancova models applied to the combined dataset allowed to identify the underlying ecological processes governing the system, and construct conceptual graphic models of the periphyton¿environment relationships observed. With the first factor, variability in water quality was due to autotrophic (photosynthesis and nutrient uptake) and heterotrophic (respiration and decomposition) processes affecting water quality in opposite directions.

In some countries, this prawn is considered an invasive species that requires close monitoring. Recent changes in the taxonomy of this species (separation of M. rosenbergii and M. dacqueti) require a re-evaluation of introduced taxa. In this work, molecular analyses were used to determine which of these two species was introduced into Brazil and to establish the geographic origin of the introduced populations that have invaded Amazonian coastal waters. The species introduced into Brazil was M. dacqueti through two introduction events involving prawns originating from Vietnam and either Bangladesh or Thailand. These origins differ from historical reports of the introductions and underline the need to confirm the origin of other exotic populations around the world. The invading populations in Amazonia require monitoring not only because the biodiversity of this region may be affected by the introduction, but also because admixture of different native haplotypes can increase the genetic variability and the likelihood of persistence of the invading species in new habitats...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Marine {{biological}} invasions {{have been}} {{regarded as one of}} the major causes of native biodiversity loss, with shipping and aquaculture being the leading contributors for the introductions of alien species in aquatic ecosystems. In the present study, five aquatic alien species (one mollusk, three crustaceans and one fish spe-cies) were detected during dives, shore searches and from the fisheries on the coast of the Delta do Parnaíba Environmental Protection Area, in the States of Piauí and Maranhão, Northeastern Brazil. The species were the bicolor purse-oyster Isognomon bicolor, the whiteleg shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei, the <b>giant</b> <b>river</b> <b>prawn</b> Macrobrachium rosenbergii, the Indo-Pacific swimming crab Charybdis hellerii and, the muzzled blenny Omobranchus punctatus. Ballast water (I. bicolor, C. hellerii, and O. punctatus) and aquaculture activities (L. vannamei and M. rosenbergii) in adjacent areas are the most likely vectors of introduction. All exotic species found have potential impact risks to the environment because they are able to compete against native species for resources (food and habitat). Isognomon bicolor share the same habitat and food items with the native bivalve species of mussels and barnacles.
