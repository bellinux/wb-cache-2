50|$|Ionization at {{atmospheric}} pressure {{often leads to}} a loss of ions during the transfer of the ions from the ambient pressure region to the vacuum of the mass analyzer.

50|$|The {{proportionality}} {{between the}} energy of the charged particle travelling through the chamber and the total charge created makes proportional counters useful for charged particle spectroscopy. By measuring the total charge (time integral of the electric current) between the electrodes, we can determine the particle's kinetic energy because the number of ion pairs created by the incident ionizing charged particle is proportional to its energy. The energy resolution of a proportional counter, however, is limited because both the <b>initial</b> <b>ionization</b> event and the subsequent 'multiplication' event are subject to statistical fluctuations characterised by a standard deviation equal to the square root of the average number formed. However, in practice these are not as great as would be predicted due to the effect of the empirical Fano factor which reduces these fluctuations. In the case of argon, this is experimentally about 0.2.|$|E
40|$|Intensity-calibrated color video {{recordings}} of three barium-shaped charge injections in the ionopshere {{were used to}} determine the <b>initial</b> <b>ionization,</b> the column density corresponding to unity optical depth, and the yield of vaporized barium in the fast jet. It was found that the <b>initial</b> <b>ionization</b> at the burst was less than 1 % and that 0 % burst ionization was consistent with the observations. Owing to the Doppler shift, the column density for optical thickness in the neutral barium varies somewhat according to the velocity distribution. For the cases examined here, the column density was 2 - 5 x 10 (exp 10) atoms/sq cm. This value, which occurred 12 to 15 s after release, should be approximately valid for most shaped charge experiments. The yield was near 30 % (15 % in the fast jet) for two of the releases and was somewhat lower in the third, which also had a lower peak velocity.

40|$|We study {{effects of}} the fully ionized initial state, or pre-ionization, on the {{subsequent}} thermal evolution of low-metallicity clouds under various intensities of the external far-ultraviolet(FUV) and cosmic-ray(CR) fields. The pre-ionization significantly affects the thermal and dynamical evolution of metal-free clouds without FUV/CRs by way of efficient HD formation. On the other hand, the pre-ionization effect on the thermal evolution is limited in very low-density regime for more metal-enriched clouds ([Z/H] >~ - 4) or those under modest FUV (> 10 ^{- 3 }) or CR field (> 0. 1 of the present-day Galactic disk levels).

40|$|A {{study of}} the unique role of {{impurities}} in the <b>initial</b> stages of <b>ionization</b> relaxation in shock-heated argon, using a sampling mass spectrometer to determine the ionic products of the reaction, is described. The ions are extracted from the shock tube through a small orifice in the end wall after they have diffused through the dense thermal layer adjacent to the wall from the ionizing gas behind the reflected shock wave. The ion diffusion is analysed in detail to assess {{the possibility that the}} sampling process alters the reaction products. It is shown that this is unlikely because the impurities are in dilute concentration and the reaction is studied in its initial stages. This mode of sampling is compared with others. The experiments were conducted in argon at temperature of 16, 600 °K and pressure of 16 mmHg with an estimated impurity level of 300 parts per million. A surprisingly large number of different ions were detected during the <b>initial</b> stages of <b>ionization.</b> O+ and H+ were found in much greater amounts {{than any of the other}} products, each being about five times more abundant than A+. The results suggest that H 2 O is probably quite generally the most important impurity in thermal-ionization experiments, and that ionization ‘incubation’ is due to dissociation of molecular impurities (especially H 2 O) before ionization commences.

40|$|We use {{a simple}} one-zone {{model of the}} thermal and {{chemical}} evolution of interstellar gas to study whether molecular hydrogen (H 2) is ever an important coolant of the warm, diffuse interstellar medium (ISM). We demonstrate that at solar metallicity, H 2 cooling is unimportant and the thermal evolution of the ISM is dominated by metal line cooling. At metallicities below 0. 1 Z_solar, however, metal line cooling of low density gas quickly becomes unimportant and H 2 can become the dominant coolant, even though its abundance in the gas remains small.

40|$|The {{locations}} of Brønsted acid sites (BAS) in the channels of medium-pore zeolites {{have a significant}} effect on the spontaneous ionization of para -terphenyl (PP 3) insofar as spatial constraints determine the stability of transition states and charge-transfer complexes relevant to charge separation. The ionization rates and ionization yield values demonstrate that a strong synergy exists between the H + polarization energy and spatial constraints imposed by the channel topology. Spectroscopic and modeling results show that PP 3 incorporation, charge separation, charge transfer and charge recombination differ dramatically among zeolites with respect to channel structure (H-FER, H-MFI, H-MOR) and BAS density in the channel.

40|$|A {{sampling}} technique {{for measuring the}} diffusive flux of charged particles from an ionized gas to a cold wall by measuring the effusive electrical current through a small orifice in the wall {{has been used to}} study slightly ionized argon behind reflected shock waves. The technique is described and the transient diffusion process upon which it depends is considered in some detail. Computations based on a simple one-dimensional isothermal charge diffusion model illustrate the features and give the result that the effect of the electric body forces is generally greater on the ions and less on the electrons than originally expected. These results are used in an approximation to the nonisothermal problem to give a relation between the measured effusive current and the ion density in the hot gas. Preliminary observations of the dependence of ion density on time and temperature in the <b>initial</b> stages of <b>ionization</b> relaxation are reported.

The ionization of PEI was characterized by potentiometric titration, which indicated a pH-dependent conformational transition. The dispersion of SiC particles {{in the presence of}} PEI was found to strongly depend on the alpha(i). In the presence of 0. 4 % by weight PEI, the 23. 8 % SiC by volume (Phi(SiC) = 23. 8) slurries showed a Newtonian behavior for alpha(i) = 0. 12 - 0. 4 values, whereas a shear-thinning behavior was observed for alpha(i) > 0. 4 in the optimal pH range of around pH 4. The rheological behavior of the slurries exhibited a strong dependence on the concentration of PEI of alpha(i) = 0. 12 - 0. 4 and the slurry showed a Newtonian behavior at an optimal concentration of 0. 4 % by weight. The stabilization may be dominated by an electrosteric effect arising from the adsorbed PEI of alpha(i) = 0. 12 - 0. 4.

Measurements of the CS 23 + ion in coincidence with the three electrons identify the energy range where stable trications are formed. A sharp peak in this energy range is identified as the 2 Π ground state at 53. 1 ± 0. 1 eV, which is the lowest electronic state according to ab initio molecular orbital calculations. Triple ionization by the double Auger effect is provisionally divided, {{on the basis of}} the pattern of energy sharing between the two Auger electrons into contributions from direct and cascade Auger processes.

40|$|In a small high {{pressure}} discharge gap, avalanches and streamers start ionization but do not produce gas heating or a conducting bright filamentary channel. The electron density is not high enough to promote the ion-electron interaction that leads to rapid neutral gas heating. Nevertheless, long after <b>initial</b> <b>ionization</b> has subsided in a gap, a very rapid transient stage is produced. This constitutes the spark proper and changes a weakly ionized cold gas into a hot, highly conducting luminous fluid.

It has been suggested many times that the spark transition can be associated with electron fluid behavior : For instance, using 2 mm long gaps we have shown that the <b>initial</b> <b>ionization</b> produces a long-lived high temperature, non-equipartition electron fluid, and that the propagation of fast luminous fronts can be associated with non-linear electron waves. 1 Here we present evidence to show that, under appropriate conditions, subsonic electron fluid behavior can also be exhibited.

As spontaneous ionization is associated with the sorption process, it is closely correlated with the molecule diffusion and, thus, is very slow due to the bulky size of the molecule. In this case, radical cations and subsequent charge transfer complexes are stabilized for months in high yield and are clearly characterized by diffuse reflectance UV-vis absorption, EPR, and Raman scattering in resonance and in off-resonance conditions.

Many such systems use corona bars to produce ultraviolet (UV) and vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) light as photo-ionization sources for this purpose. Corona bars are transient surface discharges, typically in a cylindrical geometry, that sustain high electron temperatures {{and so are}} efficient UV and VUV sources. In this paper, results from a numerical study of surface corona-bar discharges in a multi-atmosphere pressure Ne/Xe gas mixture are discussed. The discharge consists of a high-voltage electrode placed {{on the surface of}} a corona bar which is a dielectric tube surrounding a cylindrical metal electrode.

As the discharge propagates around the circumference, the surface of the corona-bar is charged. The combined effects of surface curvature and charge deposition result in a non-monotonic variation of the electric field and electron temperature as the ionization front traverses the circumference.
