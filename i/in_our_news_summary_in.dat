It protects target server and networks by delaying 32. 4 % incoming requests. This relieves congestion in networks by reducing response packet drop rate from 25 % to 2 %.

Further, we find that NEWS shows similar performance as the best possible rate limiter. ...|$|R

40|$|Residents’ {{groups have}} been in {{existence}} in New Zealand for almost 150 years yet very {{little is known about}} them. The collection of residents’, ratepayers’ and progressive associations, community councils, neighbourhood committees and the like make up a part of the community governance sector that numbers over a thousand-strong. These groups are featured prominently <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>news</b> media, are active in local government affairs and expend many thousands of volunteer hours every year in their work in communities… but what exactly is that work? From the literature we see these groups can be a source of local community knowledge (Kass et al., 2009), a platform for political activity (Deegan, 2002), critical of government (Fullerton, 2005) or help maintain government transparency and accountability (Mcclymont and O'Hare, 2008). They are sometimes part of the establishment too (Wai, 2008) and are often heard promoting the interests of local people (Slater, 2004). Residents’ groups can be set up to represent the interests of a specific demographic group (Seng, 2007) or focus on protecting or promoting a sense of place (Kushner and Siegel, 2003) or physical environment (Savova, 2009). Some groups undertake charitable activities (Turkstra, 2008) or even act in a negative manner that can impact on the community (Horton, 1996). This research examines 582 New Zealand organisations to derive a set of purposes that residents’ groups perform and ascertains how their purposes differ between geo-social and political locality and over three distinct eras of community development. The thesis also examines the relationship between residents’ groups and councillors, council officers, district health board members and civil defence and seeks to uncover if the level of engagement (if any) has an affect on their overall raison d’etre. The research concludes with a typology of New Zealand residents’ groups along with the key purposes of each type...|$|R

40|$|Today {{most people}} are in {{agreement}} that the media industry is in crisis. Many newsrooms cut down on staff. At {{the same time the}} PR industry is growing. We wanted to research if this could affect the unbiased and independent <b>news</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>news</b> media today. Today's newsrooms receive a lot of press releases every day. How many of these reach the published <b>news?</b> <b>Our</b> main purpose was to study the origin of the news published in four different media. To study how many of the news that came from press releases and learn the opinion about press releases of each news editor, and if they treat different senders in different ways. We examined four different media: one daily newspaper, one tabloid, one local radio sta-tion and one regional television newscast. This we did by examine two days of their news. To find out the source in a reliable way we called the people appearing in the article and not just the reporter. We also interviewed the news editor of each media. Our results show that our theory on cutting down staff would affect the use of press releas-es did not correlate with the reality. According to <b>our</b> study the <b>news</b> editors and news-rooms are mostly positive towards press releases. They use them as any other tip or source. However they all agree that, since they get so many, {{it takes a lot of}} their time to sort them all out. Although all editors also agree that they don't rely on getting news from press re-leases, the result shows otherwise. Press releases seem to be a daily part of the newsrooms, at least the two days we examined. Our result also shows that there is a difference in usage of press releases between the different media organizations, and the press releases that are mostly used come from authorities and not from profit-driven companies. Our study excludes sports and culture, because we wanted to focus on the most unbiased part of the news. If these had not been excluded the result would probably have been very different...|$|R

40|$|Uppsatsens syfte är att se vilka urval, lokala och {{regional}}a nyhetsprogram gör innehållsmässigt och geografiskt. De analysenheter vi valt är TV 4 Nyheterna Jönköping och SVT Smålandsnytt. Vi jämförde även de två programmens inslag beträffande typ och längd. Vi studerade under tre veckors tid nyhetssammanfattningen 21. 55 från TV 4 Nyheterna Jönköping och nyhetssammanfattningen 22. 15 från SVT SmålandsNytt. Anledningen till att vi valde nyhetssammanfattningar var för att vi vill se vad som kanalerna ansåg vara de viktigaste händelserna under dagen, det som var värt att sammanfatta. Den valda metoden är kvantitativ innehållsanalys. Valet gjordes för att vi ville undersöka statistiskt mätbara variabler, som tid, olika ämnen i inslagen och antal inslag per kommun. Detta är statistisk data och lämpar sig bäst då att räkna kvantitativt. Analysen har gjorts med hjälp av en kodbok och kodblanketter. Resultaten visade att i TV 4 Nyheterna Jönköping fanns det en stark centralisering till sändningsorten, Jönköping. I SmålandsNytt däremot fanns inte lika stark koncentration till Växjö, som är SmålandNytts sändningsort, utan även här dominerade Jönköping. Detta anser vi beror på det uppmärksammade studentmordet som rapporterats mycket om i programmen. De inslagslängder som var vanligast i båda nyhetsprogrammen var 16 - 30 sekunder. Det ämne som uppmärksammandes mest var brott/olyckor. Våra resultat visade inte på några stora skillnader mellan nyhetsprogrammen. Our aim {{with the}} essay {{is to see}} how local and regional two news programmes are and which news they prioritize. The chosen programmes are TV 4 Nyheterna Jönköping and SVT Smålandsnytt. We will look into the differences between those two, {{when it comes to}} the type of elements, but also the difference in how long the elements are (in terms of time). The material we chose where the <b>news</b> <b>summary</b> 09. 55 pm from TV 4 Nyheterna Jönköping and the <b>news</b> <b>summary</b> 10. 15 pm from SVT SmålandsNytt, for three weeks. The reason why we chose <b>news</b> <b>summaries</b> is because we want to see what the channels consider are the most important events during the day, witch news where worth summarize. The selected method is quantitative content analysis. We chose that because we wanted to examine statistically measurable variables, as time, different matters in the elements and numbers elements by the municipality. Since it is statistical fact it suits best to count quantitatively. The analysis has been done with the aid of a code book and code forms. The results showed that TV 4 Nyheterna Jönköping had centralization to consignments place, Jönköping. But when it comes to SmålandsNytt, they did not have any centralization to the consignments place, instead Jönköping dominated here also. We consider that this can to do the with murder of a student that has been reported a lot about in the programmes. When it came to the time length of the elements that dominated in both of the news programmes where 16 - 30 seconds and the most common matters where criminal/accidents. According to Hadenius and Weibull are criminal/accidents one of the most primary readings at the newspaper readers.
