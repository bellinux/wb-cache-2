5|$|Although {{there were}} only a handful of {{consistent}} superstring theories, it remained a mystery why there was not just one consistent formulation. However, as physicists began to examine string theory more closely, they realized that these theories are related in <b>intricate</b> <b>and</b> nontrivial ways.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Witten's announcement, string theorists had {{identified}} five versions of superstring theory. Although these theories appeared, at first, {{to be very}} different, work by several physicists showed that the theories were related in <b>intricate</b> <b>and</b> nontrivial ways. In particular, physicists found that apparently distinct theories could be unified by mathematical transformations called S-duality and T-duality. Witten's conjecture was {{based in part on}} the existence of these dualities and in part on the relationship of the string theories to a field theory called eleven-dimensional supergravity.|$|E
5|$|The {{geometric}} {{designs in}} Islamic art are often built on combinations of repeated squares and circles, {{which may be}} overlapped and interlaced, as can arabesques (with which they are often combined), to form <b>intricate</b> <b>and</b> complex patterns, including {{a wide variety of}} tessellations. These may constitute the entire decoration, may form a framework for floral or calligraphic embellishments, or may retreat into the background around other motifs. The complexity and variety of patterns used evolved from simple stars and lozenges in the ninth century, through a variety of 6- to 13-point patterns by the 13thcentury, and finally to include also 14- and 16-point stars in the sixteenth century.|$|E

5|$|The pre-Columbian Maya civilization {{developed}} and used an <b>intricate</b> <b>and</b> fully functional writing system, {{which is the}} only Mesoamerican script that can be said to be almost fully deciphered. Earlier-established civilizations to the west and north of the Maya homelands that also had scripts recorded in surviving inscriptions include the Zapotec, Olmec, and the Zoque-speaking peoples of the southern Veracruz and western Chiapas area—but their scripts are as yet largely undeciphered. It is generally agreed that the Maya writing system was adapted from {{one or more of these}} earlier systems. A number of references identify the undeciphered Olmec script as its most likely precursor.|$|E
5|$|An earlier cathedral was located, between 1075 and 1228, on {{the hill}} top near the ancient fort at Old Sarum. In the early 13th century {{it was decided to}} move the {{location}} of the cathedral to the plain. The new building was designed in the Lancet Gothic style (otherwise known as Early English Gothic) by Elias of Dereham and Nicholas of Ely and begun in 1220, starting at the eastern end, and rising westward until by 1258 it was complete, except for the façade and central tower. The façade, huge cloister and polygonal chapter house were then constructed by Richard Mason and were completed by about 1280, the later work employing Geometric Decorated tracery in the openings of windows and arcades. It was about fifty years before the major undertaking of the tower and spire was commenced, the architect being Richard Farleigh and the details being rather more <b>intricate</b> <b>and</b> elaborate than the earlier work. The entire cathedral was complete by 1380, and the only subsequent inclusion of note has been the reinforcement of the arches of the tower when one of the piers developed a bend. This three-part building program spanning 160 years with a fifty-year gap in the middle is the shortest and least diverse and makes Salisbury by far the most homogenous of all the cathedrals.|$|E
