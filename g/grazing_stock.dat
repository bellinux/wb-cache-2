40|$|The {{effect of}} grazing {{pressure}} on infiltration, runoff, and soil loss was studied on a natural pasture {{during the rainy}} season of 1995 in the Ethiopian highlands. The study was conducted at two sites with 0 - 4 percent and 4 - 8 percent slopes at the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) Debre Zeit research station, 50 km south of Addis Ababa. The grazing regimes were: light <b>grazing</b> <b>stocked</b> at 0. 6 animal-unit-months (AUM) /ha; moderate <b>grazing</b> <b>stocked</b> at 1. 8 AUM/ha; heavy <b>grazing</b> <b>stocked</b> at 3. 0 AUM/ha; very heavy <b>grazing</b> <b>stocked</b> at 4. 2 AUM/ha; very heavy grazing on ploughed soil stocked at 4. 2 AUM/ha; and a control with no grazing. Heavy to very heavy grazing pressure significantly reduced biomass amounts, ground vegetative cover, increased surface runoff and soil loss, and reduced infiltrability of the soil. Reduction in infiltration rates was greater on soils which had been ploughed and exposed to very heavy trampling. It was observed that, for the same percent vegetative cover, more soil loss occurred from plots on steep than gentle slopes, and that gentle slopes could withstand more grazing pressure without seriously affecting the ground biomass regeneration compared to steeper slopes. Thus, {{there is a need for}} developing `slope-specific' grazing management schedules particularly in the highland ecozones rather than making blanket recommendations for all slopes. More research is needed to quantify annual biophysical changes in order to assess cumulative long-term effects of grazing and trampling on vegetation, soil, and hydrology of grazing lands. Modelling such effects is essential for land use planning in this fragile highland environment...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} grazing on soil {{physical}} {{properties in the}} east African highland was studied from 1996 to 1998. The study was conducted at two sites with 0 - 4 % and 4 - 8 % slopes at the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) Debre Ziet Research Station, 50 km south of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The grazing regimes were; light <b>grazing</b> <b>stocked</b> at 0. 6 animal-unit months per hectare (AUM) h- 1, moderate <b>grazing</b> <b>stocked</b> at 1. 8 (AUM) h- 1, heavy <b>grazing</b> <b>stocked</b> at 3. 0 (AUM) h- 1 very heavy <b>grazing</b> <b>stocked</b> at 4. 2 (AUM) h- 1, very heavy grazing on plowed soil stocked at 4. 2 (AUM) h- 1; and a control with no grazing. The grazing pressure has no impact on total nitrogen of the soil. Since manure is not collected from grazing plots the soil organic matter content did not decline, it was rather stable and slightly increasing. Grazing has improved the plant available-P compared to nongrazed plots at both slopes in all soil depths. Soil bulk density and total porosity did not show significant differences among different grazing pressures. At both sites the soil water content was high in heavily grazed plots {{as compared to the}} rest of the treatments. The steady state infiltration rate was significantly different only in light grazing treatment at 4 - 8 % slope. Finally livestock grazing with good management and manure recycling to the grazed plots could not degrade soil physical and hydrological properties. Hence, over utilization of the available grass herbage by livestock and removing manure from grazed plots is responsible for soil degradation...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} grazing cattle on {{vegetation}} was studied on a natural pasture {{during the rainy}} and dry seasons of 1995 in the Ethiopian highlands. The study used 0. 01 ha plots, established on 0 - 4 percent and 4 - 8 percent slopes located {{close to each other}} at Debre Zeit research station, 50 km South of Addis Ababa. The grazing regimes were: light <b>grazing</b> <b>stocked</b> at 0. 6 animal-unit-mouth per hectare (AUM ha- 1); moderate <b>grazing</b> <b>stocked</b> at 1. 8 AUH ha- 1; heavy <b>grazing</b> <b>stocked</b> at 3. 0 AUM ha- 1; very heavy <b>grazing</b> <b>stocked</b> at 4. 2 AUM ha- 1; very heavy grazing on ploughed pasture stocked at 4. 2 AUM ha- 1; and a control of `no grazing'. Heavy grazing significantly reduced vegetative cover and biomass yields, especially on steeper slopes. Light to heavy grazing did not affect the botanical composition of the vegetation at both sites, but very heavy grazing resulted in species normally less preferred by animals dominating the botanical composition. Grazing did not have significant effect on ground vegetative cover on the 0 - 4 percent slope except at very heavy grazing pressure, but on the 4 - 8 percent slope even moderate grazing significantly reduced vegetative cover. Light to moderate grazing {{at the beginning of the}} dry period enhanced plant biomass productivity, while any grazing reduced plant productivity during the periods of reduced growth. Species richness increased with increasing grazing pressure compared with no grazing, but decreased sharply at very heavy grazing pressure. It is concluded that there is need for developing `slope and time specific' grazing management practices, and to assess short and long term effects of grazing and trampling on vegetation...|$|R

Heavy to very heavy grazing pressure significantly increased surface runoff and soil loss and reduced infiltrability of the soil. It was observed that fine textured soils were more susceptible to trampling effects than coarse textured soils, and that reduction in infiltration rates was greater on soils which had been tilled and exposed to very heavy trampling. The problems of high runoff and erosion rates on the upper slopes {{is likely to be}} exacerbated by the fact that during the rainy season higher grazing pressure is exerted on the upper than lower slopes.

50|$|Predators, Parasites, and Diseases - Austroderia richardii is predominately predated on by herbivores, which {{includes}} {{a wide range of}} New Zealand endemic bird species and exotic bird species. They mainly feed on the seed from the plumes that flower in spring to summer. It is not poisonous but it can be assumed that most herbivores would not attempt to eat the leaves of the Austroderia richardii as it has very sharp edges and tiny teeth that run along the leaves of the plant which is why it has the nickname ‘cutty grass’ (Kimberley, 2011). As well as having the ability to cut predators they are also of low palatability to introduced herbivores which means its taste is not very satisfying at all to the animals so they get no enjoyment out of eating it.

50|$|C. edulis is an {{important}} bee forage. Furthermore, it serves as fodder for camels, goats, sheep and cattle in dry season but the shrubs cannot withstand long-term grazing pressure. It {{is essential for the}} livestock production, especially in central Somalia and eastern Ethiopia where C. edulis can cover 85% of the good-quality feed during the dry season. During the rainy season, the animals usually avoid the plant because of its high content of tannins in the leaves (see table below). The leaf content of K, Ca, Mg, S, Ni, Cr, V and Ti is adequate. The content of N and P is low, whereas the latter is probably a consequence of the low P stock in the soil. Al and Fe content is high, probably due to dust. Also, the Ca/Mg and Ca/P ratio is too high. Overall, there could be problems to cover the demand of P, Mg, Mn and partly Zn of <b>grazing</b> <b>stock</b> by feeding only Yeheb. C. edulis can cause intestinal disorders in goats when eaten as the sole diet.|$|E
50|$|The long acre is a {{traditional}} term for wide grassy road verges. In some places, such as Australia, New Zealand, {{and parts of the}} British Isles, rural roads are often separated from adjoining paddocks and fields by both a hedge or fence and a wide grass verge. Rather than leaving this verge fallow, farmers often tether livestock on it to use pasture feed (in the form of the grass) that would otherwise be wasted. Historically, the long acre was also grazed by herds or flocks moving from place to place, either on long journeys, or from one small local field to another. The long acre provided an important resource for such flocks and herds, perhaps forming a significant part of a small farmer's pasture. In Australia, the most common method of keeping <b>grazing</b> <b>stock</b> off a road is by the use of a portable electric fence, visible to the stock and to passing travellers as a single white tape. The use of the long acre as pasture has sometimes become formalised. For example, in parts of England, some have been registered as common land.|$|E
