The model considered filtration that occurs after the filling process, not filtration that occurs as the suspension fills the cell. Governing equations for the temporal porosity distribution were developed for a plateand- <b>frame</b> <b>press.</b> The governing equations were solved numerically using an alternating-direction-implicit scheme. Appropriate initial and boundary conditions were determined based on {{characteristics of the}} plate-and-frame press and of the suspension properties.

40|$|Wastewater {{treatment}} is an energy intensive process often requiring {{the use of}} advanced treatment technologies. Stricter effluent standards have resulted {{in an increase in}} the number of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) with advanced treatment over time. Accordingly, associated energy consumption has also increased. Concerns about lowering operating costs for WWTPs and reducing associated greenhouse gas generation present an incentive to investigate energy use in WWTPs. This research investigated the impact of wastewater strength and the introduction of advanced treatment technologies, to replace traditional technologies on energy use to treat wastewater in WWTPs. Major unit processes were designed for a 100 MGD plant and variables controlling energy were identified and used to compute energy consumption. Except for primary clarification and plate and <b>frame</b> <b>press</b> dewatering, energy consumption computed using fundamental equations are within values in the literature. Results show that energy consumption for dissolved air flotation thickeners, centrifuges, gravity thickeners, and aeration basins are heavily influence by wastewater strength. Secondary treatment and tertiary treatment require a significant amount of energy. Secondary treatment requires 104 times the energy of preliminary treatment, 17 times the energy of solids processing, and 2. 5 times the energy of tertiary treatment. Secondary treatment requires 41 times the energy of preliminary treatment, and 7 times the energy of solids processing. The results of this research provide a means of estimating energy consumption in the design and operation phase of a WWTP. By using the fundamental equations and methodology presented, alternative technologies can be compared or targeted for future energy savings implementation. Limitations of the methodology include design assumptions having to be made carefully, as well as assumptions of motor and equipment efficiencies...|$|E

50|$|With {{both types}} of mount, springs are {{needed to keep the}} <b>frame</b> <b>pressed</b> against the ball bearings, unless the mount is {{designed}} to be used only in an orientation where gravity will keep the frame in place. Following the cantilever principle, a large mount allows finer control than a smaller one. The frames are ideally made of a light material, to make the resonant frequency of the structure high. This reduces vibration, since many common sources of vibration are relatively low frequency. For stability, the fixed frame is supported by a rigid mount that is securely bolted to a supporting surface. In a laboratory environment, this is typically an optical table. A shock can cause the mount {{to move away from the}} ball bearings, but because there are only 6, hard contacts, the mirror will return to the original position, preserving the alignment.|$|R

Nevertheless, eco-design principles {{in the field}} of forming presses have seldom been confronted in the scientific literature. In this paper, an optimization model is proposed, suitable for designing <b>press</b> <b>frames</b> which are optimal in terms of energy efficiency. First, a framework is proposed for modular and functional description of a machine tool is described, in order to identify the largest energy consuming modules and functions. Then, a simple analytical model of loads, stresses and deformations is proposed for pre-stressed structures. Then, the equations of the analytical models are used as the constraints of a numerical global optimization algorithm, aimed at minimizing the amount of energy stored into the <b>press</b> <b>frame</b> and the extra-energy due to deformation of the columns in the usage lifetime of the press. The results clearly show that, only if the <b>press</b> <b>frame</b> structure is monolithic, it is possible to obtain a solution which is truly optimal. This conclusion is robust with respect to potential noise or uncertainty issues, which in this case are mainly related to the coefficient of the objective functions. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
