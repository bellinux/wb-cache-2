5|$|Sibu BASE jump is {{an annual}} event that is held in September every year since 2009, which lasts for 3 days. Night jumps are also {{performed}} {{if the weather is}} fair. The BASE jumping usually takes place from the top of Wisma Sanyan which is 126 m high and is the tallest building in Sarawak. The number of <b>jumpers</b> has increased from 11 <b>jumpers</b> in 2009 to 45 <b>jumpers</b> in 2014. In 2013, world's first tandem BASE jumping from a building (Wisma Sanyan in Sibu) was done by Sean Chuma (world-renowned BASE jumper), carrying Rudy Anoi (chief executive of Sarawak Tourism Board, Sibu branch) with him.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the force}} of impact, <b>jumpers</b> {{occasionally}} survive the fall from the bridge, though not without sustaining serious injuries.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{many other}} ants that use scent to forage for food, jack <b>jumpers</b> use their sight to target their prey. Like other bull ants, they are solitary when they forage, but only workers perform this role. These ants are omnivores and scavengers, {{typically}} foraging in warmer temperatures. They deliver painful stings, which {{are effective in}} both killing prey and deterring predators. Jack <b>jumpers</b> have smooth stingers, and can thus sting indefinitely. Jack jumper ants are skilled hunters, partially due to their excellent vision; they can even kill and devour wasps and bees. They also kill and eat other ants, such as carpenter ants (Camponotus) and feed on sweet floral secretions and other sugar solutions. Jack <b>jumpers</b> often hunt for spiders, and will sometimes follow their prey for a short distance, usually with small insects and small arthropods. Jack jumper ants, alongside M. simillima, have been given frozen houseflies (Musca domestica) and blowflies (Calliphoridae) as food under testing conditions. The ant has been observed to run and leap energetically at flies when they land, particularly on Acacia shrubs, plants or trees. Jack <b>jumpers</b> and other Myrmecia ants prey on insects such as cockroaches and crickets.|$|E
50|$|<b>Jumper</b> pins (points to be {{connected}} by the <b>jumper)</b> are arranged in groups called <b>jumper</b> blocks, each group having at least one pair of contact points. An appropriately sized conductive sleeve called a <b>jumper,</b> or more technically, a shunt <b>jumper,</b> is slipped over the pins to complete the circuit.|$|R
5000|$|In Jeffrey's clothes <b>Jumper</b> meets Carpenter (Danny Sommers)—an angry, {{straight}}-identifying man who dislikes {{gays and}} resists their advances—outside a porn theater. When Carpenter enters the theater to avoid <b>Jumper</b> (and watch straight porn), <b>Jumper</b> follows him. Unaware of <b>Jumper's</b> nature, Carpenter cannot resist temptation {{and they give}} each other handjobs and oral sex. He brings <b>Jumper</b> to his motel room for more fun. While Carpenter is asleep <b>Jumper</b> takes his clothes, leaving him Jeffrey's (and a condom). While he talks to [...] "Dad", <b>Jumper</b> admits his feelings for Carpenter; however, {{he does not know}} his first name.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Jumper</b> Open Source Project is a {{community}} effort, led by <b>Jumper</b> Networks, devoted to building and maintaining the open source version of <b>Jumper.</b>|$|R
5|$|For the {{parachute}} jump, Bond and the Queen were played respectively by BASE <b>jumpers</b> and stuntmen Mark Sutton and Gary Connery. After {{the film was}} shown, the Queen entered the stadium via conventional means and formally opened the Games.|$|E
5|$|It is {{suggested}} that people should avoid jack <b>jumpers,</b> but this is difficult to do. Closed footwear (boots and shoes) along with socks reduce the chances of encountering a sting, but wearing thongs or sandals will put the person at risk. With this said, they are still capable of stinging through fabric, and can find their way through gaps in clothing. Most stings occur when people are gardening, so taking extra caution or avoiding gardening altogether is recommended. People can also avoid encountering jack <b>jumpers</b> by moving to locations where jack jumper populations are either low or absent, or eliminate nearby nests. Since Myrmecia ants have different venoms, people who are allergic to them are advised {{to stay away from}} all Myrmecia ants, especially to ones they have not encountered before.|$|E
5|$|Norway sent {{a strong}} {{contingent}} with four <b>jumpers</b> {{able to win}} the event, including reigning Olympic and world champion Jacob Tullin Thams. Andersen had won all eight Norwegian qualification events. World record holder Nels Nelsen from Canada was not permitted to participate due to financial problems. Japan participated in an international ski jumping competition for the first time, also becoming the first Asian country to do so. After the first jump, three Norwegians were in the lead. A 40-minute discussion erupted regarding the speed, with Central European <b>jumpers</b> wanting it increased. This was complied with by the jury, resulting in falls by several favorites, including the most vocal speed increase proponents, Gérard Vuilleumier and Bruno Trojani. Andersen and Ruud won by reducing their speed on the in-run.|$|E
40|$|A hanging <b>jumper</b> beam of a {{transmission}} tower is adopted as a countermeasure against a short fault of <b>jumper</b> conductors under strong winds. However {{it is thought}} that the hanging <b>jumper</b> beam may cause the vibration of transmission tower members due to its weight when the hanging <b>jumper</b> beam starts to vibrate under strong winds. The authors have conducted an excitation test of a strain transmission tower with the hanging <b>jumper</b> beam to comprehend the dynamic behaviors of the hanging <b>jumper</b> beam. In this paper the effects of the oscillation of hanging <b>jumper</b> beam on side members are investigated based on the excitation test data, and the information for estimating the vibration of the hanging <b>jumper</b> beam under a string wind is organized...|$|R

5|$|Canada had {{originally}} planned to send two ski <b>jumpers,</b> Nels Nelsen and Melbourne McKenzie. Nelsen held world {{record for the}} longest ski jump. However, lack of funding meant that they planned for work for their fare on a freighter. These plans were stopped by officials from the British delegation, who organized the Canadian team and who felt working for their fare was inappropriate and not fitting for the team, and Nelsen never competed in any Winter Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Thorpe {{began his}} {{athletic}} career at Carlisle in 1907 {{when he walked}} past the track and beat all the school's high <b>jumpers</b> with an impromptu 5-ft 9-in jump still in street clothes. His earliest recorded track and field results come from 1907. He also competed in football, baseball, lacrosse and even ballroom dancing, winning the 1912 intercollegiate ballroom dancing championship.|$|E

5|$|A {{challenger}} to Planica {{arrived in}} 1949 {{with the construction}} of Heini-Klopfer-Skiflugschanze ("Heini Klopfer ski flying hill") in Oberstdorf, West Germany. Designed by former ski jumper turned architect Heini Klopfer, as well as then-active ski <b>jumpers</b> Toni Brutscher and Sepp Weiler, the hill had a K-point of 120m to match that of Bloudkova velikanka. The FIS, still wary of the rising popularity of ski flying and wanting to keep it in check, refused to sanction the construction of the hill, having previously denounced the 1947 and 1948 events in Planica.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of men {{volunteered for}} smoke jumping, showing their {{willingness}} to take great personal risks. When fire was detected by a lookout, smoke <b>jumpers</b> were flown directly to the site and dropped by parachute to quickly contain and extinguish the fire. From base camps scattered through the forests of Montana, Idaho and Oregon, the men were flown as many as 200 miles to fire sites, carrying firefighting tools and a two-day supply of K-rations. For larger fires, additional men, supplies and food were airdropped to expand the effort. Up to 240 CPS men served in this specialized program. One of the smokejumping schools was at Camp Paxson in Montana.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Aston {{teamed up}} with {{television}} producer Tim Taylor and together they created two shows which focused on bringing archaeology into British popular consciousness. The first was the short-lived Time Signs (1991), although {{this was followed by}} the more successful Time Team, which was produced for Channel 4 from 1994 to 2013. Aston was responsible for identifying sites for excavation and for selecting specialists to appear on the show, and through the programme became well known to the viewing public for his trademark colourful <b>jumpers</b> and flowing, untidy hairstyle. In 1996 he was appointed to the specially-created post of Professor of Landscape Archaeology at Bristol University, and undertook a ten-year project investigating the manor at Shapwick, Somerset.|$|E

5|$|Jumping {{technique}} {{has played a}} significant part {{in the history of}} the event. High <b>jumpers</b> typically cleared the bar feet first in the late 19th century, using either the Scissors, Eastern cut-off or Western roll technique. The straddle technique became prominent in the mid-20th century, but Dick Fosbury overturned tradition by pioneering a backwards and head-first technique in the late 1960s – the Fosbury Flop – which won him the gold at the 1968 Olympics. This {{technique has}} become the overwhelming standard for the sport from the 1980s onwards. The standing high jump was contested at the Olympics from 1900 to 1912, but is now relatively uncommon outside of its use as an exercise drill.|$|E
5|$|Led by Baylor and West at 38.3 and 30.8ppg respectively, the Lakers {{improved}} to 54–26 in 1961–62, {{and made the}} finals. In a game five victory, Baylor grabbed 22 rebounds and set the still-standing NBA record for points in a finals game with 61, despite fouling out of the game. The Lakers, however, lost to the Celtics by three points in overtime of game seven. Frank Selvy, after making two <b>jumpers</b> in the final 40 seconds to tie the game, missed a potential game-winning 18foot jump shot in regulation, a miss which he said in June 2010 still haunted him more than 40 years later.|$|E
5|$|Nelsen won the home-town Winter Carnival Tournament, {{setting the}} hill record of 56meters (183ft) in Big Hill in the inauguration tournament in 1916. With this and {{subsequent}} better distances, he would hold the hill record in Revelstoke until 1932. In 1916, {{he won the}} Championship of Canada Ski Jumping Contest, which he would subsequently defend every year until 1920. He continued by setting the Canadian amateur record in 1920, and breaking it again in 1921 and 1923. He {{was among the most}} successful <b>jumpers</b> in Canada from 1916 to 1925, taking home most trophies. Among his methods to improve his jumps was placing pieces of lead at the front or back of the skies to give optimal balance.|$|E

5|$|The {{athletics}} {{competition at}} the first Olympics featured a men's long jump competition and a women's competition was introduced at the 1948 Summer Olympics. Professional long <b>jumpers</b> typically have strong acceleration and sprinting abilities. However, athletes must also have a consistent stride {{to allow them to}} take off near the board while still maintaining their maximum speed. In addition to the traditional long jump, a standing long jump contest exists which requires that athletes leap from a static position without a run-up. A men's version of this event featured on the Olympic programme from 1900 to 1912.|$|E
5|$|The first {{military}} execution in the war's western theater occurred on March 27, 1863, at Camp Burnside (Burnside Barracks). Robert Gay, a 27-year-old schoolteacher from Clay County, Indiana, was executed by a 20-man firing squad. After his capture by Confederates at Richmond, Kentucky, Gay declared {{allegiance to the}} Confederate States of America to escape further army service. After his return to Indiana, Gay was convicted of treason and executed, but not before he apologized {{for what he had}} done. Other executions took place in 1864, when three bounty <b>jumpers</b> were executed at Burnside Barracks.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the more}} {{original}} castings was Anette Sagen, the world's leading female ski jumper, {{in her first}} film role. Sagen, 22 at the time, played the part of 70-year-old Owe's ski jumping mother, although in a younger incarnation. Hamer had already considered Sagen for the role, when he ran into her by chance at the Holmenkollen Ski Museum. Without knowing to whom he was talking, Hamer mentioned that he was shooting a film in this location, and was planning to ask Anette Sagen to be in it. The reason the theme of ski jumping was chosen was that Hamer's own mother performed the sport, and the film {{has been described as}} a tribute to all female ski <b>jumpers.</b> Sagen herself had also earlier been involved in a controversy over women's access to professional venues and competitions. Incidentally, Sagen and Owe are also both from the Norwegian town of Mosjøen.|$|E

On March 1, 2012 <b>Jumper</b> become SAIC's CEO and was essential in splitting the company into two. After the split <b>Jumper</b> remained the CEO {{of the company}} which {{changed its name to}} Leidos. <b>Jumper</b> retired as CEO in July 2014, when Roger Krone succeeded him as the company's new CEO, but <b>Jumper</b> stayed on as chairman of the company's board of directors.|$|R
25|$|Winmar {{donated the}} <b>jumper</b> {{he was wearing}} in the {{photograph}} to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) in 1998. Prior to the commission's disbanding in 2005, Geoff Clark, the chairman of ATSIC at the time, removed the framed <b>jumper</b> from the commission's offices in Canberra {{to his home in}} Warrnambool, Victoria. Clark was forced to return the <b>jumper</b> to Winmar, which was later donated to the National Museum of Australia, where it featured in Off the Walls, an exhibit of Indigenous Australian art. In May 2012, the <b>jumper</b> was auctioned by Sotheby's, but was passed in after the bidding reached A$95,000. In September of the same year, Museum Victoria purchased the <b>jumper</b> for $100,000, with the intention to display it at the First Peoples exhibition at Melbourne Museum in July 2013. However, the authenticity of the <b>jumper</b> has been questioned, with the St Kilda Football Club published a statement in March 2005 suggesting that the <b>jumper</b> given to ATSIC {{may not have been the}} actual <b>jumper</b> worn during the game, citing differences between sponsors' logos present on the <b>jumper.</b> Similar questions were raised prior to the <b>jumper's</b> auction in 2012.|$|R
