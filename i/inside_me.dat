25|$|Two of Thompson's books (The Getaway and The Killer <b>Inside</b> <b>Me)</b> {{were adapted}} as Hollywood motion {{pictures}} {{during his lifetime}} receiving relatively poor reviews. However, Polito argues that neither adaptation was ultimately true to Thompson's spirit. A second, more faithful adaptation of The Killer <b>Inside</b> <b>Me</b> was released in 2010, starring Casey Affleck and directed by Michael Winterbottom.|$|E
25|$|After The Killer <b>Inside</b> <b>Me</b> was published, Thompson began {{producing}} novels at {{a furious}} pace. He published one further novel in 1952, then five novels {{a year in}} both 1953 and 1954.|$|E

25|$|The {{early to}} mid fifties saw Thompson {{reaching}} his stride as a mature writer. In 1952, The Killer <b>Inside</b> <b>Me</b> was published. It is perhaps Thompson's finest and best-known novel. The narrator, Lou Ford, is a small-town deputy sheriff who appears amiable, pleasant and slightly dull-minded. Ford is actually very intelligent and fighting a nearly-constant urge to act violently; Ford describes his urge as the sickness (always italicised). Lion Books unsuccessfully attempted to have The Killer <b>Inside</b> <b>Me</b> {{nominated for a}} National Book Award. It was eponymously adapted to the cinema, in 1976 (by director Burt Kennedy, with Stacy Keach as Lou Ford), and again in 2010 (by director Michael Winterbottom, with Casey Affleck as Ford and co-starring Kate Hudson and Jessica Alba).|$|E

25|$|Thompson's writing {{culminated in}} {{a few of his}} best-regarded works: The Killer <b>Inside</b> <b>Me,</b> Savage Night, A Hell of a Woman and Pop. 1280. In these works, Thompson became one of the writers who turned the derided crime genre into {{literature}} and art, featuring unreliable narrators, odd structure, and quasi-surrealistic inner narratives of the last thoughts of his dying or dead characters. A number of Thompson's books became popular films, including The Getaway and The Grifters.|$|E

25|$|Similar {{unreliable}} narrators {{often appear}} in detective novels and thrillers, where even a first-person narrator might hide essential information and deliberately mislead the reader {{in order to}} preserve the surprise ending. In some cases, the narrator describes himself or herself as doing things which seem questionable or discreditable, only to reveal in the end that such actions were not what they seemed (e.g. Alistair MacLean's The Golden Rendezvous and John Grisham's The Racketeer). Crime novelist Jim Thompson used the device of a narrator who is belatedly revealed to be psychotic and possibly delusional repeatedly in his books, most notably The Killer <b>Inside</b> <b>Me,</b> Savage Night, A Hell of a Woman, and Pop. 1280.|$|E
