5|$|During the Cold War {{between the}} Soviet Union and the United States, huge {{stockpiles}} of uranium were amassed {{and tens of}} thousands of nuclear weapons were created using enriched uranium and plutonium made from uranium. Since the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991, an estimated 600short tons (540metric tons) of highly enriched weapons grade uranium (enough to make 40,000 nuclear warheads) have been stored in often inadequately guarded facilities in the Russian Federation and several other former Soviet states. Police in Asia, Europe, and South America on at least 16 occasions from 1993 to 2005 have intercepted shipments of smuggled bomb-grade uranium or plutonium, most of which was from ex-Soviet sources. From 1993 to 2005 the Material Protection, Control, and Accounting Program, operated by the federal government of the United States, spent approximately US $550 million to help safeguard uranium and plutonium stockpiles in Russia. This money was used for improvements and security enhancements at research and storage facilities. Scientific American reported in February 2006 that in some of the facilities security consisted of chain link fences which were in severe states of disrepair. According to an interview from the article, one facility had been storing samples of enriched (weapons grade) uranium in a broom closet before the improvement project; another had been keeping track of its stock of nuclear warheads using <b>index</b> <b>cards</b> kept in a shoe box.|$|E

Because when we are going to speak, write, or learn another language we need lot of vocabularies. In fact in the field most of students’ were lazy in memorizing the new vocabularies. They also happened in “MTs Darul Hikmah”, especially the students for seventh class. They did not only lack in of vocabulary but also they did not have strong motivation during learning process. To solve this problem, <b>index</b> <b>card</b> match game was chosen because the researcher was sure that this {{is the best way to}} solve. The statement of the problem as follows “How can <b>index</b> <b>card</b> match game improve the seventh class students’ vocabularies ability at Islamic junior high school MTS Darul Hikmah?” and “How the students’ motivation after they are told by using <b>index</b> <b>card</b> match game?” the purpose of the study is how this method could improve the students’ vocabularies ability at the seventh class of MTs Darul Hikmah Tulungagung. The design of the research was classroom action research (was adapted from Arikunto at. al). In the Cycle have four procedures they are: planning, acting, observing and reflecting. The subjects of this study were 20 students of first grade at MTs Darul Hikmah Tawangsari Tulungagung in the academic year 2010 / 2011. From the vocabulary mastery they have low motivation and they have poor vocabularies, the researcher knew this problem from their result of preliminary study and questionnaires. And in this study, the researcher could achieve the criteria of the success in one cycle. This action research involved one Cycle consisting of three meetings. The implementations of <b>index</b> <b>card</b> match game. As the finding from pretest and questionnaires it was shown that there was improvement of the students’ vocabulary ability from preliminary study to the last meeting. In The result of preliminary study showed that the students’ average scores is 4, 4. And there was only 1 student who get 7, while the result of Cycle I showed that the students’ average is 7. 15 and there were 15 students who get the result 7 and above 7. And also the students’ motivations were increased based on their class involvement and questionnaire. Depend on students’ improvement in score and motivations, the researcher did not continue the Cycle because the criteria of success were achieved. As the conclusion of this study, the students’ vocabulary ability could be improved using <b>index</b> <b>card</b> match game. The improvement was caused by the students’ interest in the use of <b>index</b> <b>card</b> match game. The students feel more relaxed during English class and they also have good motivation in learning process Therefore, the students can made improvement on their vocabulary score. Finally, in using <b>index</b> <b>card</b> match game, the researcher suggests to the English teacher to make sure that the students have understood well the material before playing <b>index</b> <b>card</b> match game.
