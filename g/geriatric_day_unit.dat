We strongly agree with their finding that shows the importance of clinical pharmacist involvement in the optimization of pharmacotherapy in elderly patients. Furthermore, we especially appreciate their new and interesting findings that the clinical pharmacist was more frequently requested by physicians and nurses {{for information about the}} pharmacotherapy of the patients on the <b>geriatric</b> <b>day</b> <b>unit,</b> compared with the orthogeriatric ward at admission and discharge (5. 7 % vs 1. 2 % and 1. 7 %, respectively, P< 0. 05), and that the pharmacist asked for more confirmation of the physician orders on the <b>geriatric</b> <b>day</b> <b>unit</b> rather than the orthogeriatric ward (19. 8 % vs 1. 8 % and 15. 7 % at admission and discharge, respectively, P< 0. 05). We are from a Joint Commission International (JCI) -accredited academic medical center hospital with 3200 beds in China. Safe medication management and use are pivotal to patient safety and quality of care on which the state-of-the-art standards of the Joint Commission focus. We would like to share our perspectives in the following paragraphs. View original paper by Cortejoso and colleagues.  ...|$|E

Besides polypharmacy and multiple comorbidities, the age-related pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes may {{increase the risk of}} adverse drug reactions and medication errors. Objective: The main target {{of this study was to}} describe the characteristics of pharmaceutical interventions in two geriatric wards (orthogeriatric ward and <b>geriatric</b> <b>day</b> <b>unit)</b> of a general teaching hospital and to evaluate the clinical significance of the detected medication errors. Materials and methods: The study was conducted between August 2014 and October 2015 and was based on a triple approach that included validation of medical orders, medication reconciliation at patients’ admission, and a predischarge planning appointment with the patient. The validation of medical orders was based on analyzing the suitability of the drugs prescribed, the drug dose depending on the patient’s characteristics, the presence of contraindications and interactions between drugs, and the proposal of alternative drugs included in the hospital formulary. Results: A total of 2, 307 interventions associated to a medication error in 15, 282 medical orders for 1, 859 older patients were recorded. The greater part of the interventions carried out on the orthogeriatric ward at admission and at discharge were due to omission of a drug in the medical order (20. 0 %) and clinically significant interactions requiring monitoring (30. 4 %), respectively. The main factor triggering pharmacist’s recommendations on the <b>geriatric</b> <b>day</b> <b>unit</b> was clinically significant interactions (21. 1 %). With regard to the clinical severity of the detected errors, 68. 1 % were considered significant, 24. 8 % were of minor significance, and 7. 2 % were clinically serious. Conclusion: Our findings show the importance of clinical pharmacist involvement in the optimization of pharmacotherapy in older adults, ensuring that they receive effective, safe, and efficient drug therapy.

40|$|Objectives: The frailty {{phenotype}} {{proposed by}} Fried and colleagues {{is a widely}} used frailty screening instrument, consisting of 5 components: weight loss, exhaustion, low grip strength, slow gait speed, and low physical activity. Although equally considered in the computation of the frailty phenotype score, each of the components may present a specific and different weight in clinical practice. The objective {{of this study was}} to estimate the weight of each frailty phenotype component in terms of age-related deficit accumulation, defined according to the frailty index (FI) proposed by Rockwood and colleagues. Design: Cross-sectional study. Participants: Data were used from 484 frail older adults admitted to a <b>geriatric</b> <b>day</b> hospital <b>unit</b> of the Toulouse University Hospital. Measurements: The outcome measure was a 35 -item FI based on data routinely collected as part of a clinical assessment. Descriptive statistics and linear regression analyses were used to determine which components of the frailty phenotype were most strongly associated with the FI. Results: The mean age of the participants was 83. 2 (SD 6. 0). All components of the frailty phenotype were significantly associated with the FI, but the magnitude of the associations varied. Linear regression analyses, adjusted for age, sex, and educational level showed that slow gait speed was the most informative component (B = 0. 129, P <. 001) and weight loss was the least informative component (B = 0. 027, P = 037). The combination of slow gait speed and low physical activity was the most strongly associated with the FI (B = 0. 144, P <. 001). Conclusion: Of the 5 components of the phenotype, slow gait speed seems to be the key indicator of frailty...|$|R
40|$|Although <b>geriatric</b> <b>day</b> {{hospitals}} {{are widely used}} in other countries, especially Britain, where they are important components of geriatric services, they are rare in the USA.

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{review of the}} international literature concerning the organisation of the <b>Geriatric</b> <b>Day</b> Hospital (GDH) was performed. From 1987 till now, few papers were found describing the activity {{and the effectiveness of}} the GDH. All the studies comparing specific geriatric approaches to regular medicine demonstrate the efficiency of geriatric care, particularly the geriatric assessment. So, with a degree of evidence 1 a, a better outcome is found for patients undergoing a geriatric assessment and intervention, compared to patients having no geriatric assessment at all. However, {{there is no evidence of}} benefit for the <b>geriatric</b> <b>day</b> hospital compared to patients treated in a geriatric ward or other location of geriatric care. Moreover, there is no clear consensus on the settings and activities of a <b>geriatric</b> <b>day</b> hospital. Terms as <b>day</b> <b>unit,</b> <b>day</b> hospital, day care, are used interchangeably and are not always covering the same activity. The same remark can be made on the exact composition of the geriatric multidisciplinary team and its role. However nurses and paramedical workers are always mentioned as all performing geriatric assessment. The diagnostic activities on the GDH are seldom described and studied. More information is available on rehabilitation activity, often developed in specific patient populations such as stroke patients, dementia patients, cardiac patients or patients with other chronic diseases. In this selected patient populations positive effects on outcome are shown in the GDH (level of evidence 1 a). Another problem is the heterogeneity of the population. For scientific reason the GDH should focus on organising care for specific medical problems. Diseases as dementia, stroke, cardiac insufficiency, could be good models to investigate the efficiency of geriatric assessment and interventions within the setting of a GDH...|$|R

40|$|A {{review of}} the first 7 years of {{experience}} with the <b>geriatric</b> <b>day</b> hospital at Sunnybrook Medical Centre in Toronto revealed the following about the patients attending the day hospital during that time: most were 60 to 79 years old; over 85 % attended 1 or 2 days a week; more than two thirds lived with a spouse or relatives; {{and more than half}} had diseases of the circulatory system or mental disorders. The day hospital offers a varied therapeutic program while easing the demands on the energy and time of the patient's spouse or family and thus helps the elderly to remain in the community rather than live in an institution. The experience at Sunnybrook has shown that <b>geriatric</b> <b>day</b> hospitals can be a valuable component of the broad spectrum of integrated services and programs that must be developed to provide adequate health care for the growing number of older people in our population...|$|R
40|$|In 1978 {{the normal}} {{function}} of a large <b>geriatric</b> <b>day</b> hospital was halted by 16 weeks of industrial action. Comparing affected patients with a matched control population for the years 1974 - 80 showed an appreciable increase in acute hospital admissions and deaths of those affected by the stoppage, which suggests an obvious benefit {{for those who are}} selected for attendance at a <b>geriatric</b> <b>day</b> hospital. Neither the number of acute admissions nor the number of deaths during the two months after normal services were resumed differed appreciably from those in the control years. No single cause predominates among those reported for acute admission or death during the affected year. These findings are relevant given the recent closure of several day hospitals by health authorities to cut costs. There are no published figures showing unequivocal benefits for attendance at day hospitals, and many clinicians remain unaware of their function.

40|$|SUMMARY A {{longitudinal}} {{survey of}} the social support of patients attending one <b>geriatric</b> <b>day</b> hospital confirmed an impression that support was not being adjusted to meet the changing degrees of dependency among the patients. An experimental study, in which the social support available to {{a small group of}} consecutive new admissions was reduced, showed that their dependency scores were not significantly different from those of a control group which continued to receive support. The significance of this finding in reducing the cost of day hospital care is discussed. Much {{has been written about the}} benefit elderly patients derive from day hospitals, but no study has shown whether this benefit is provided at the expense of an increase in the social support of the patients. Nor has any study confirmed that there is any associated reduction in the services such patients need, although such a result would clearly be advantageous. Social service costs are a heavy item in the overall cost of day hospital care. In one of the few costings of <b>geriatric</b> <b>day</b> hospitals, Ross (1976) based the social service costs on data obtained from 50 patients attending during a typical week, but did not take account of the fact that patients were at different stages in their rehabilitation, nor of the change in the amount of social support needed by patients as they become more independent. Therefore, the social service costs may have been overestimated. A longi-tudinal {{survey of the}} social support of patients attending St. David's <b>Geriatric</b> <b>Day</b> Hospital, Cardiff, is reported in Part 1 of this paper, and an experimental study is described in Part 2. In this, the social support available to a small group of consecu-tive new admissions was reduced, while a control group continued to be supported...|$|R
40|$|Many <b>geriatric</b> <b>day</b> {{hospitals}} are under-utilized. A survey of general practitioners' opinions on referral systems to day hospitals in east Surrey produced an 85 % response rate. Of the 80 general practitioners who responded 58 % referred occasionally, 39 % frequently and 4 % never. When asked about referring patients {{directly to the}} day hospital via the coordinator instead of via the consultant geriatrician, 58 % of general practitioners said {{they would like to}} have direct access, and 87 % were in favour of other health workers involved with the elderly initiating referrals with the general practitioner's consent. Rehabilitation was mentioned as the main reason for referral by 76 % of general practitioners, medical assessment by 56 % and social care by 48 %. Comments received suggested that the hospital day was too long and that early rising associated with attendance caused stress in the elderly attenders. It is concluded that the present system of referral via the consultant is not always satisfactory and that a referral card system which permits general practitioners to refer directly to the <b>geriatric</b> <b>day</b> hospital may increase utilization...|$|R
40|$|Background: Stroke {{survivors}} may not {{be receiving}} optimal rehabilitation {{as a result of}} a shortage of hospital resources, and many of them are institutionalized. A rehabilitation program provided in a short-term residential care setting may help to fill the service gap. Objectives: The primary objectives of this study were, first, to examine whether there were significant differences in terms of rehabilitation outcomes at 1 year after admission to the rehabilitation program (defined as baseline) between those using short-term residential care (intervention group) and those using usual <b>geriatric</b> <b>day</b> hospital care (control group), and, second, to investigate whether lower 1 -year institutionalization rates were observed in the intervention group than in the control group. Participants: 155 stroke survivors who completed at least the first follow-up at 4 months after baseline. Intervention: The intervention group was stroke survivors using self-financed short-term residential care for stroke rehabilitation. The control group was stroke survivors using the usual care at a public <b>geriatric</b> <b>day</b> hospital. Measurements: Assessments were conducted by trained research assistants using structured questionnaires at baseline, 4 months, and 1 year after baseline. The primary outcome measures included Modified Barthel Index score, Mini-Mental Status Examination score, and the institutionalization rate. Results: Cognitive status (as measured by Mini-Mental Status Examination score) of patients in both groups could be maintained from 4 months to 1 year, whereas functional status (as measured by Modified Barthel Index score) of the patients could be further improved after 4 months up to 1 year. Meanwhile, insignificant between-group difference in rehabilitation outcomes was observed. The intervention participants had a significantly lower 1 -year institutionalization rate (15. 8 %) than the control group (25. 8 %). Conclusion: Short-term residential care for stroke rehabilitation promoted improvements in rehabilitation outcomes comparable with, if not better than, the usual care at <b>geriatric</b> <b>day</b> hospital. Furthermore, it had a significantly lower 1 -year institutionalization rate. This type of service could be promoted to prevent institutionalization. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} certain {{quality of}} life outcomes, as well as comparative costs of care, for selected types of persons entering three very distinct types of alternative service programs that address the long-term care needs of vulnerable elderly persons: nursing homes (NH), <b>geriatric</b> <b>day</b> hospitals (GDH), and senior center (SC) programs. For selected outcomes, based on secondary {{analysis of the data}} gathered in another study, it was possible to add to the comparison samples of similar types of persons entering small foster-type domiciliary care homes (DC). From pools of persons entering these programs, six separate sets of comparison samples who were similar at baseline were constructed (GDH-SC, NH-SC, NH-GDH, NH-DC, SC-DC, GDH-DC). Only analyses pertaining to institutionalization and costs were conducted for the last three sets of comparison groups. Except for the issue of institutionalization, {{quality of life}} impact analysis showed only a few more post-test differences than would be expected by chance (although the few post-test differences that were observed in each case favored less restrictive settings). This more general similarity of outcome is indeed provocative, suggesting that in many ways the applicants adapted similarly to these quite distinct programs. Cost analyses found that nursing home and <b>geriatric</b> <b>day</b> hospital care, the two most restrictive settings, were also the two most expensive interventions...|$|R
