25|$|Nitric oxide is a {{compound}} produced by many {{cells of the}} body. It relaxes vascular smooth muscle by binding to the heme moiety of cytosolic <b>guanylate</b> <b>cyclase,</b> activating <b>guanylate</b> <b>cyclase</b> and increasing intracellular levels of cyclic-guanosine 3’,5’-monophosphate, which then leads to vasodilation. When inhaled, nitric oxide dilates the pulmonary vasculature and, because of efficient scavenging by hemoglobin, has minimal effect on the vasculature of the entire body.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a theory}} that, in some nerve cell synapses, when {{long-term}} memories are being laid down, the receiving cell makes carbon monoxide, which back-transmits to the transmitting cell, telling it to transmit more readily in future. Some such nerve cells {{have been shown to}} contain <b>guanylate</b> <b>cyclase,</b> an enzyme that is activated by carbon monoxide.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{mechanisms}} by which NO has been demonstrated to affect the biology of living cells. These include oxidation of iron-containing proteins such as ribonucleotide reductase and aconitase, activation of the soluble <b>guanylate</b> <b>cyclase,</b> ADP ribosylation of proteins, protein sulfhydryl group nitrosylation, and iron regulatory factor activation. NO has been demonstrated to activate NF-κB in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, an important transcription factor in iNOS gene expression in response to inflammation.|$|E
25|$|It {{was found}} that NO acts through the {{stimulation}} of the soluble <b>guanylate</b> <b>cyclase,</b> which is a heterodimeric enzyme with subsequent formation of cyclic-GMP. Cyclic-GMP activates protein kinase G, which causes reuptake of Ca2+ {{and the opening of}} calcium-activated potassium channels. The fall in concentration of Ca2+ ensures that the myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK) can no longer phosphorylate the myosin molecule, thereby stopping the crossbridge cycle and leading to relaxation of the smooth muscle cell.|$|E
25|$|Sildenafil protects cyclic {{guanosine}} monophosphate (cGMP) from degradation by cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) in the corpus cavernosum. Nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum of the penis binds to <b>guanylate</b> <b>cyclase</b> receptors, which results in increased levels of cGMP, leading to smooth muscle relaxation (vasodilation) of the intimal cushions of the helicine arteries. This smooth muscle relaxation leads to vasodilation and increased inflow of blood into the spongy tissue of the penis, causing an erection. Robert F. Furchgott, Ferid Murad, and Louis Ignarro won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1998 for their independent study of the metabolic pathway of nitric oxide in smooth muscle vasodilation.|$|E
2500|$|... eNOS has a {{protective}} {{function in the}} cardiovascular system, which is attributed to NO production. Regulation of the vascular tone {{is one of the}} best known roles of NO in the cardiovascular system. Once produced in endothelial cells, NO diffuses across the vascular smooth muscle cell membranes and activates the enzyme soluble <b>guanylate</b> <b>cyclase</b> (sGC), which catalyzes the conversion of guanosine triphosphate into cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). cGMP, in turn, activates protein kinase G (PKG), which promotes multiple phosphorylation of cellular targets lowering cellular Ca2+ concentrations and promoting vascular relaxation.|$|E
2500|$|Barrett's {{esophagus}} occurs due {{to chronic}} inflammation. [...] The principal {{cause of the}} chronic inflammation is gastroesophageal reflux disease, GERD (UK: GORD). [...] In this disease, acidic stomach, bile, and small intestine and pancreatic contents cause damage to {{the cells of the}} lower esophagus. Recently, bile acids were shown to be able to induce intestinal differentiation, in gastroesophageal junction cells, through inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) [...] and the protein kinase enzyme Akt. This results in the eventual up-regulation of the p50 subunit of protein complex NF-κB (NFKB1), and ultimately activation of the homeobox gene CDX2, which is responsible for the expression of intestinal enzymes such as <b>guanylate</b> <b>cyclase</b> 2C. This mechanism also explains the selection of HER2/neu (also called ERBB2) and the overexpressing (lineage-addicted) cancer cells during the process of carcinogenesis, and the efficacy of targeted therapy against the Her-2 receptor with trastuzumab (Herceptin) in the treatment of adenocarcinomas at the gastroesophageal junction.|$|E

50|$|NO diffuses {{into the}} smooth muscle {{cells of the}} blood vessel and interacts with soluble <b>guanylate</b> <b>cyclase.</b> Nitric oxide stimulates the soluble <b>guanylate</b> <b>cyclase</b> to {{generate}} the second messenger, 3’,5’ guanosine monophosphate (cyclic GMP) from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The soluble cGMP activates cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase G (PKG or cGKI). PKG is a kinase that phosphorylates a number of proteins that regulate calcium concentrations and calcium sensitization, hyperpolarizes cell through potassium channels, and causes actin filament and myosin dynamic alterations that result in smooth muscle relaxation.|$|E
50|$|This {{nitric oxide}} diffuses into {{neighboring}} cells (including vascular smooth muscle cells and platelets), where {{it increases the}} activity of the enzyme soluble <b>guanylate</b> <b>cyclase,</b> leading to increased formation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) from guanosine triphosphate (GTP). The cGMP then activates cGMP-dependent kinase or PKG (protein kinase G). Activated PKG promotes vasorelaxation (via a reduction of intracellular calcium levels), alters the expression of genes involved in smooth muscle cell contraction, migration and differentiation, and inhibits platelet activation. Nitric oxide-soluble <b>guanylate</b> <b>cyclase</b> signaling also leads to anti-inflammatory effects.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Guanylate</b> <b>cyclase</b> ( [...] , {{also known}} as guanyl cyclase, guanylyl cyclase, or GC) is a lyase enzyme. <b>Guanylate</b> <b>cyclase</b> is often part of the G protein {{signaling}} cascade that is activated by low intracellular calcium levels and inhibited by high intracellular calcium levels. In response to calcium levels, <b>guanylate</b> <b>cyclase</b> synthesizes cGMP from GTP. cGMP keeps cGMP-gated channels open, allowing for the entry of calcium into the cell. [...] Like cAMP, cGMP is an important second messenger that internalizes the message carried by intercellular messengers such as peptide hormones and NO, and can also function as an autocrine signal. Depending on cell type, it can drive adaptive/developmental changes requiring protein synthesis. In smooth muscle, cGMP is the signal for relaxation, and is coupled to many homeostatic mechanisms including regulation of vascular and airway tone, insulin secretion, and peristalsis. Once formed, cGMP can be degraded by phosphodiesterases, which themselves are under different forms of regulation, depending on the tissue.|$|E
