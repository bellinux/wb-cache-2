With P(EO-b-MAA) copolymers, hexagonal prismatic particles form. Their sizes and size distributions depend on the <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>polymerization</b> <b>of</b> the blocks.

Carothers worked out the theory of step-growth polymerization and derived the Carothers equation which relates the average <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>polymerization</b> to the fractional conversion (or yield) of monomer into polymer.

No difference in association constants between various hairy regions and procyanidins DP 9 was found. Nevertheless, arabinan chains showed lower association constants, and hairy regions of pectins with only monomeric side chains showed higher association with procyanidin DP 30. Only very low affinities were obtained with rhamnogalacturonans II and arabinogalactan–proteins. Aggregation could be observed only with the procyanidins of DP 30 and the protein-rich arabinogalactan–protein.

25|$|Minerals are {{classified}} by key chemical constituents; the two dominant systems are the Dana classification and the Strunz classification. The silicate class of minerals is subdivided into six subclasses by the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>polymerization</b> in the chemical structure. All silicate minerals have a base unit of a 4− silica tetrahedron—that is, a silicon cation coordinated by four oxygen anions, {{which gives the}} shape of a tetrahedron. These tetrahedra can be polymerized to give the subclasses: orthosilicates (no polymerization, thus single tetrahedra), disilicates (two tetrahedra bonded together), cyclosilicates (rings of tetrahedra), inosilicates (chains of tetrahedra), phyllosilicates (sheets of tetrahedra), and tectosilicates (three-dimensional network of tetrahedra). Other important mineral groups include the native elements, sulfides, oxides, halides, carbonates, sulfates, and phosphates.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{amphiphilic}} {{block copolymer}} micelles display a similar behavior as surfactant micelles. These are generally called dynamic micelles and {{are characterized by}} the same relaxation processes assigned to surfactant exchange and micelle scission/recombination. Although the relaxation processes are the same between {{the two types of}} micelles, the kinetics of unimer exchange are very different. While in surfactant systems the unimers leave and join the micelles through a diffusion-controlled process, for copolymers the entry rate constant is slower than a diffusion controlled process. The rate of this process was found to be a decreasing power-law of the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>polymerization</b> of the hydrophobic block to the power 2/3. This difference is due to the coiling of the hydrophobic block of a copolymer exiting the core of a micelle.|$|E

25|$|Sonication is an {{efficient}} {{tool for the}} synthesis of polymers. The cavitational shear forces, which stretch out and break the chain in a non-random process, result in a lowering of the molecular weight and poly-dispersity. Furthermore, multi-phase systems are very efficient dispersed and emulsified, so that very fine mixtures are provided. This means that ultrasound increases the rate of polymerisation over conventional stirring and results in higher molecular weights with lower polydispersities. Ormosils (organically modified silicate) are obtained when silane is added to gel-derived silica during sol-gel process. The product is a molecular-scale composite with improved mechanical properties. Sono-Ormosils are characterized by a higher density than classic gels {{as well as an}} improved thermal stability. An explanation therefore might be the increased <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>polymerization.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>polymerization</b> can be {{described}} by both the structure formed and how many tetrahedral corners (or coordinating oxygens) are shared (for aluminium and silicon in tetrahedral sites). Orthosilicates (or nesosilicates) have no linking of polyhedra, thus tetrahedra share no corners. Disilicates (or sorosilicates) have two tetrahedra sharing one oxygen atom. Inosilicates are chain silicates; single-chain silicates have two shared corners, whereas double-chain silicates {{have two or three}} shared corners. In phyllosilicates, a sheet structure is formed which requires three shared oxygens; in the case of double-chain silicates, some tetrahedra must share two corners instead of three as otherwise a sheet structure would result. Framework silicates, or tectosilicates, have tetrahedra that share all four corners. The ring silicates, or cyclosilicates, only need tetrahedra to share two corners to form the cyclical structure.|$|E

Protonation helps to delocalize the otherwise trapped diiminoquinone-diaminobenzene state. Emeraldine base is regarded as the most useful form of polyaniline due to its high stability at room temperature and the fact that, upon doping with acid, the resulting emeraldine salt form of polyaniline is highly electrically conducting.

2500|$|Tannins {{are found}} in the skin, stems, and seeds of wine grapes but can also be {{introduced}} to the wine through the use of oak barrels and chips or with the addition of tannin powder. The natural tannins found in grapes are known as proanthocyanidins due to their ability to release red anthocyanin pigments when they are heated in an acidic solution. Grape extracts are mainly rich in monomers and small oligomers (mean <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>polymerization</b> <8). Grape seed extracts contain three monomers (catechin, epicatechin and epicatechin gallate) and procyanidin oligomers. Grape skin extracts contain four monomers (catechin, epicatechin, gallocatechin and epigallocatechin), as well as procyanidins and prodelphinidins oligomers. The tannins are formed by enzymes during metabolic processes of the grapevine. The amount of tannins found naturally in grapes varies depending on the variety with Cabernet Sauvignon, Nebbiolo, Syrah and Tannat being 4 of the most tannic grape varieties. The reaction of tannins and anthocyanins with the phenolic compound catechins creates another class of tannins known as pigmented tannins which influence the color of red wine. Commercial preparations of tannins, known as enological tannins, made from oak wood, grape seed and skin, plant gall, chestnut, quebracho, gambier and myrobalan fruits, can be added at different stages of the wine production to improve color durability. The tannins derived from oak influence are known as [...] "hydrolysable tannins" [...] being created from the ellagic and gallic acid found in the wood.|$|E
