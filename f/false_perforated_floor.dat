40|$|Experimental and {{computer}} simulation of in-bin grain drying was conducted. The {{study was to}} model the non-uniform distribution of temperature and moisture content in bins with slanted or partially <b>perforated</b> <b>floors,</b> hence with non-parallel airflow streamlines. Complete data were obtained for grain drying with non-parallel airflow. These data included moisture contents, temperatures, static pressures, intergranular air velocities, and shrinkage of the drying beds. The intergranular air velocities measured {{were found to be}} about three times those calculated from the superficial air velocity divided by the bulk porosity. The non-parallel airflow regions were more pronounced near the air entrance. A way from the entrance regions, the air velocity profile tended to be uniform. The partially <b>perforated</b> <b>floor</b> created higher resistance to airflow than the totally or slanted <b>perforated</b> <b>floors.</b> The drying pattern depended on the floor configuration. For the slanted floor, grain {{at the center of the}} bin remained undried at about 20 % moisture content when the average moisture content of the bin reached 14 % (w. b.). Typical bulk shrinkage of grain was about 20 % for grain dried from 22 % to 12 % moisture content. The shrinkage was non-uniform with the slanted floor. Grain shrinkage resulted in denser packing of the grain and an increase in the resistance to airflow. This increase was somewhat compensated for by a decrease in the grain bed depth. The net decrease in airflow supplied to the bin was about 13 %. An improved simulation scheme was developed to simulate the airflow distribution and to compute heat and mass transfer processes along streamlines. The improved simulation scheme predicts the general pattern of moisture content. Under non-parallel airflow conditions, the model provides a better estimation of moisture content than it does of grain temperature. Accurate prediction of airflow distribution was needed to simulate the grain drying process accurately. More work is required to simulate three dimensional flow and drying with concurrent grain shrinkage...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Unidirectional airflow {{cleanroom}} {{was designed}} to ideally control the flow in order to overcome airborne contamination problems, and that design has not changed much {{over the past twenty}} years. However, in reality, it didn’t work as expected. Thus, airborne contamination problems in semiconductor and flat panel display industries still existed even if entire fabrication was processed in unidirectional cleanrooms. Eventually, flow-based re-evaluation of existing unidirectional cleanroom design became inevitable. In this study, we performed fluid dynamics simulations of unidirectional cleanroom at various dimensions, and interpreted the results for further steps of cleanroom designs, such as, inlet/outlet ducts, <b>perforated</b> <b>floors,</b> and equipment arrangement. Furthermore, we developed the mathematical model that interprets the airflow inclination at various cleanroom dimensions into a unified representation to provide designers with concepts for flow-based integration of cleanroom layout. The predicted angle/location of the maximum flow inclination by our mathematical model in terms of fundamental design parameters agreed well with the computational fluid dynamics simulation results and with the expected trends...|$|R
50|$|In {{batch drying}} methods, {{certain amount of}} grain is placed first, usually 2 to 4 inches, the batch is dried and cooled later, then drying is stopped and batch is removed.

There is a drying floor under the bin roof and the drying fan and burner is installed high on the bin wall. When the drying process is completed, grain is put in the regular bin floor, thus unloading time is reduced. However, there is no wet grain holding in bin-batch roof dryers and there is more expense on machines.|$|R

25|$|Cleanrooms {{maintain}} particulate-free {{air through}} the use of either HEPA or ULPA filters employing laminar or turbulent air flow principles. Laminar, or unidirectional, air flow systems direct filtered air downward or in horizontal direction in a constant stream towards filters located on walls near the cleanroom floor or through raised <b>perforated</b> <b>floor</b> panels to be recirculated. Laminar air flow systems are typically employed across 80% of a cleanroom ceiling to maintain constant air processing. Stainless steel or other non shedding materials are used to construct laminar air flow filters and hoods to prevent excess particles entering the air. Turbulent, or non unidirectional, air flow uses both laminar air flow hoods and nonspecific velocity filters to keep air in a cleanroom in constant motion, although not all in the same direction. The rough air seeks to trap particles that may be in the air and drive them towards the floor, where they enter filters and leave the cleanroom environment.

Effective porosities primarily for the two dimensional case were established as follows: (1) comparison of experimental data for two geometrically similar models of different chord/height ratio, an overall value of wall porosity could be deduced; (2) theoretical development which allows for unequal porosity for the floor and ceiling and wall boundary pressure measurements, porosities for floor and ceiling could be deduced; (3) a scheme was developed which allowed unequal porosity of floor and ceiling and streamwise varying porosity. The boundary layer development along the <b>perforated</b> <b>floor</b> and ceiling {{under the influence of the}} model pressure field, variations in boundary layer thickness underlining the difficulties in deducing meaningful values of wall porosity were determined.

A separate survey entry is contained for Clonmoyle Flour Mills, giving the company name of 'John Young and Sons Limited, Clonmoyle, Coachford', which company appears to exist to this day. The survey states that numerous mills were erected around the Great Famine (Ireland) period to meet increased demand for the processing of Indian meal and it was thought Clonmoyle Mill was built for this reason as between 1847 and 1854.

40|$|Finding ways to {{conserve}} energy {{and reduce costs}} associated with growing crops {{continues to be a}} critical challenge for Ohio agriculture. Significant energy inputs must be supplied by the farmer to grow a crop. For example, the production of an average field of corn can require an estimated 8 million Btu of purchased energy per acre. An estimated 3 million of the fuel and electrical energy use may be required for conventional grain drying. According to survey results reported in 1996, nearly 80 percent of the shelled corn harvested in Ohio was dried on the farm. Twenty percent was dried commercially. Although natural air drying was only used by approximately 8 percent of the farmers who dried corn, it shows promise for both reduced energy input and improved grain quality when properly applied and managed. Defining Natural Air Drying Natural air drying is an in-bin drying system with the following typical characteristics: • Drying process is slow, generally requiring 4 to 8 weeks. • Initial moisture content is normally limited to 22 to 24 %. • Drying results from forcing unheated air through grain at airflow rates of 1 to 2 cfm/bu. • Drying and storage occur in the same bin, minimizing grain handling. • Bin is equipped with a full <b>perforated</b> <b>floor,</b> one or more high-capacity fans, a grain distributor, and stairs (se...|$|R
40|$|Biodrying is {{a process}} that {{consists}} in reducing the moisture content and stabilizing organic compounds to obtain a useful product, such as a fuel, or as a previous step to landfilling. This is achieved by using the heat generated in the aerobic fermentation of organic compounds. The main parameters that control the process are aeration, the temperature reached in fermentation, and the initial level of moisture. In this work, the substrate was composed of agricultural harvest and gardening waste from an area in the east of Spain. The biodrying process was carried out in a greenhouse, where both the heat generated in the fermentation and the heat of the sun were used. In order to promote aeration, two factors were taken into account: one was the capacity of the shredded prunings to act as a bulking agent and the other one was a <b>perforated</b> <b>floor,</b> which allowed air to pass through.

40|$|Evolutionary {{and revolutionary}} {{advances}} in computational and storage systems have driven electronic circuit densities to unprecedented levels. These high-density systems must be adequately cooled for proper operation and long life expectancy. Cooling solutions must be designed and operated to minimize {{energy and environmental}} impacts. Executive decisions are {{deeply rooted in the}} technical aspects of the systems and solutions sought. These interdependent solutions seek to maximize system performance while minimizing capital and operating expenditures over the economic life of the data center. Traditional data centers employ a raised floor plenum structure to deliver cooling via <b>perforated</b> <b>floor</b> tiles as the primary delivery system for component cooling. Heated exhaust air exits the equipment and travels upward to warm return plenum structures for subsequent capture and re-cooling. This floor-to-ceiling airflow behavior represents a vertical airflow-cooling paradigm. The resulting airflow may travel 150 feet or more per cooling cycle. A new class of data center cooling utilizes a technique called 'in-row' cooling. This new technique does not require a raised <b>floor</b> plenum, <b>perforated</b> tiles, nor return plenum structures. The airflow travels horizontally from rack-to-rack with respect to cold air delivery and warm air return. Airflow travel is subsequently reduced to only 10 feet per cooling cycle.

40|$|NASA {{recently}} assembled {{one of the}} world's fastest operational supercomputers to {{meet the}} agency's new high performance computing needs. This large-scale system, named Columbia, consists of 20 interconnected SGI Altix 512 -processor systems, {{for a total of}} 10, 240 Intel Itanium- 2 processors. High-fidelity CFD simulations were performed for the NASA Advanced Supercomputing (NAS) computer room at Ames Research Center. The purpose of the simulations was to assess the adequacy of the existing air handling and conditioning system and make recommendations for changes {{in the design of the}} system if needed. The simulations were performed with NASA's OVERFLOW- 2 CFD code which utilizes overset structured grids. A new set of boundary conditions were developed and added to the flow solver for modeling the roomls air-conditioning and proper cooling of the equipment. Boundary condition parameters for the flow solver are based on cooler CFM (flow rate) ratings and some reasonable assumptions of flow and heat transfer data for the floor and central processing units (CPU). The geometry modeling from blue prints and grid generation were handled by the NASA Ames software package Chimera Grid Tools (CGT). This geometric model was developed as a CGT-scripted template, which can be easily modified to accommodate any changes in shape and size of the room, locations and dimensions of the CPU racks, disk racks, coolers, power distribution units, and mass-storage system. The compute nodes are grouped in pairs of racks with an aisle in the middle. High-speed connection cables connect the racks with overhead cable trays. The cool air from the cooling units is pumped into the computer room from a sub-floor through <b>perforated</b> <b>floor</b> tiles. The CPU cooling fans draw cool air from the floor tiles, which run along the outside length of each rack, and eject warm air into the center isle between the racks. This warm air is eventually drawn into the cooling units located near the walls of the room. One major concern is that the hot air ejected to the middle isle might recirculate back into the cool rack side and cause thermal short-cycling. The simulations analyzed and addressed the following important elements of the computer room: 1) High-temperature build-up in certain regions of the room; 2) Areas of low air circulation in the room; 3) Potential short-cycling of the computer rack cooling system; 4) Effectiveness of the <b>perforated</b> cooling <b>floor</b> tiles; 5) Effect of changes in various aspects of the cooling units.

40|$|High {{mortality}} in rabbit rearing {{is not only}} an economical problem but also an animal welfare issue.  Without doubt, certain common rearing practices are the main reasons for the high mortality rates.  In this review, we point out different and commonly used management practices, which neither represent adequate housing conditions for the animals’ behavioural requirements nor correspond to their nutritional needs, and discuss possibilities {{to reduce the risk of}} disease. (1)  Usually the doe is forced to build the nursery nest in the cage or in a box with a permanently open entrance, often not protected from the light.  This can lead to perinatal mortality due to disturbed maternal behaviour, such as failure to build a proper nest, depositing the kits outside the nest, or infanticide. (2)  Continuous housing of the doe with the kits does not conform to this species’ pattern of unusually limited maternal care. Stimulated by olfactory and acoustic signals emanating from the nest, the doe disturbs the inactivity of the kits by her frequent entries to the nest or attempts to close the entrance. Cooling of the kits caused by maladaptive maternal behaviour under such unnatural conditions is one of the most important causes of mortality and morbidity during the nursing period. (3)  When the doe is left to nurse the kits for longer than four weeks, which does not conform to the reproductive biology of the rabbit, kit morbidity is caused by the following factors: (a) Prolonged mother-offspring contact increases the risk of the kits becoming infected with pathogens such as coccidiosis, EPEC and pasteurellosis persisting in the doe. (b) Pre-disposition of the kits to bacterial enteropathies is encouraged by the retarded development of the enzymatic system, delayed establishment of a stable gut flora (due to the use of wood shavings or straw as nest material) and by consumption of the doe’s feed. (c) The increased energy demands of lactation as well as mastitis due to excessive and prolonged suckling by the kits decrease the fertility and the lifespan of the doe. (4)   Feed with a high non-fibre carbohydrate content (compared to green forage) promotes bacterial enteropathies when given before the development of the kits’ digestive functions is completed.  In addition, the risk of the outbreak of such diseases is enhanced by intestinal coccidiosis and unstable gut flora. (5)  In contrast to housing rabbits on <b>perforated</b> <b>floors,</b> the use of cages with deep litter increases the risk of enteropathies. </p...|$|R

A finalização da secagem em silo-secador iniciou depois de transcorridos os tempos de repouso de 4 e de 12 horas, contados imediatamente após a transferência dos grãos do secador de coluna na etapa inicial da secagem. Foram avaliados pelo beneficiamento de arroz branco e parboilizado polidos, os parâmetros do grau de umidade dos grãos, peso de mil grãos, rendimento de grãos inteiros sem defeitos, perfil branquimétrico, comportamento de cocção, perfil texturométrico e as dinâmicas da operação de secagem na etapa final em silo-secador. Os resultados mostram que: a) na seca-aeração do arroz, os manejos térmicos que utilizam crescentes temperaturas do ar na etapa inicial, associados com maiores tempos de repouso resultam em menores tempos de secagem na etapa final, sem comprometer os rendimentos de grãos inteiros sem defeitos, nem a qualidade industrial e nem a 8 qualidade tecnológica; b) quatro horas de repouso entre a etapa inicial, em secador de coluna, e a etapa final, em silo-secador, são insuficientes para a adequada difusão da água nesta etapa, e sua ampliação para doze horas de repouso diminui os tempos de aeração final com ar ambiente na seca-aeração do arroz; c) o tempo de repouso na etapa final apresenta efeitos mais marcantes sobre os tempos totais de secagem do que o manejo térmico do ar na etapa inicial em secador de coluna na seca-aeração do arroz; d) a parboilização tem efeitos mais marcantes sobre os parâmetros de perfil texturométrico, branquimétrico e de cocção do que o manejo térmico na secagem e o tempo de armazenamento dos grãos em condições ambientais resfriadas, além de restituir os parâmetros de perfil texturométrico e aumentar os rendimentos de grãos inteiros sem defeitos, os rendimentos gravimétrico e volumétrico, a proporção de água necessária e o tempo de cocção do arroz...|$|R
40|$|The need {{to improve}} on {{parboiling}} techniques by rural farmers in Nigeria {{has led to the}} development of a parboiling device at the Department of Agricultural and Environmental Engineering, University of Agriculture, Makurdi. Design and construction of a paddy rice parboiler was carried out using an empty 200 litres metal drum. It has a soaking chamber of 0. 1378 m 3 with <b>perforated</b> <b>floor</b> of 570 m 3 and a steaming chamber of 0. 0919 m 3. The steaming chamber is directly below the soaking chamber and it is provided with two drain plugs to drain water off from the paddy mass and the steaming chamber. A rotating grid is incorporated to serve as a stirrer. The parboiler is mounted on a titling frame for ease of evacuation of the paddy after parboiling. Firewood was used as the source of fuel. The evaluation of the parboiler was done using 50 kg of the long grain rice (SIPPI). The performance of the developed parboiler was compared with the traditional method of parboiling using empty drums and the industrial method. A water uptake test was carried out for the products of the developed parboiler, traditional and industrial methods. Panel subjective test was used to compare the quality of the rice parboiled with the developed parboiler, the traditional and industrial parboiler. The developed parboiler, parboiled 50 kg of rice in 30 mins. The quantity of fuel (firewood) used in parboiling was 3. 6 kg at a parboiling temperature of 950 C. The traditional parboiler parboiled 50 kg of rice in 3 hours and the quantity of fuel (firewood) used in parboiling was 9. 8 kg at a temperature of 105 0 C. Panels’ assessment showed that the quality of rice produced by the developed parboiler is good when compared to the traditional and industrial methods of parboiling. Overall results show a significant improvement, less time of operation and a cheaper cost using the developed parboiler. A 0. 05 significant level used to test the null hypothesis concluded that there is no significant difference in the water uptake of the rice parboiled using the developed, industrial and traditional parboilers at varying temperatures. With a production cost of N 15, 750 : 00 (fifteen thousand, seven hundred and fifty naira only) and an operating cost of N 400 : 00 (four hundred naira) which is equivalent to an average of 4. 2 tons/month capacity of 35 tons of parboiled paddy per year, the developed parboiler gives a higher economic benefit than the traditional parboiler which cost N 3, 500 : 00 (three thousand, five hundred naira) with an average output of 10 tons of parboiled rice per year, which is equivalent to an average of 0. 83 tons/month...|$|R
40|$|Since its {{description}} by Dandy in 1922, several {{techniques have}} been used to perform third ventriculostomy under endoscopic control. Except for the blunt technique, in which the endoscope is used by itself to create the opening in the floor of the third ventricle, the other techniques require more than one instrument to <b>perforate</b> the <b>floor</b> of the ventricle and enlarge the ventriculostomy. The new device described is a sterilizable modified forceps that allows both the opening of the floor and the enlargement of the ventriculostomy in a simple and effective way. The new device has the following characteristics: 1) the tip of the forceps is thin enough to allow the easy perforation of the floor of the ventricle; 2) the inner surface of the jaws is smooth to avoid catching vessels of the basal cistern; and 3) the outer surface of the jaws has indentations that catch the edges of the opening to prevent them from slipping along the instrument's jaws. The ventricle floor is opened by gentle pressure of the forceps, which is slowly opened so that the edges of the aperture are caught by the distal outer indentation of the jaws, leading to an approximately 4 -mm opening of the floor. This device has been used successfully in 10 consecutive patients. This new device allows surgeons to perform third ventriculostomy under endoscopic control in a very simple, quick, and effective way, avoiding the need for additional single-use instrument...|$|R
