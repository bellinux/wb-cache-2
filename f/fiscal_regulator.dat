5000|$|The State Auditor of Missouri is {{an elected}} {{official}} responsible for serving as the State of Missouri's chief <b>fiscal</b> <b>regulator,</b> conducting financial and performance audits for approximately 200 state agencies, boards, and commissions, and the state's judicial branch. The State Auditor also conducts audits for county and city governments lacking their own auditor or when requested by citizen petition. The State Auditor serves a four-year term, {{and is the only}} state Executive Branch official elected in even-numbered non-presidential election years. The office was temporarily held by John Watson after Tom Schweich, who was elected in 2010 and reelected in 2014, committed suicide on February 26, 2015. Nicole Galloway was appointed by Governor Jay Nixon to fill the office on a permanent basis until the 2018 election, effective on April 27, 2015.|$|E

40|$|Identifying {{and dating}} {{explosive}} bubbles {{when there is}} periodically collapsing behavior over time {{has been a major}} concern in the economics literature and is of great importance for practitioners. The complexity of the nonlinear structure inherent in multiple bubble phenomena within the same sample period makes econometric analysis particularly difficult. The present paper develops new recursive procedures for practical implementation and surveillance strategies that may be employed by central banks and <b>fiscal</b> <b>regulators.</b> We show how the testing procedure and dating algorithm of Phillips, Wu and Yu (2011, PWY) are affected by multiple bubbles and may fail to be consistent. The present paper proposes a generalized version of the sup ADF test of PWY to address this difficulty, derives its asymptotic distribution, introduces a new date-stamping strategy for the origination and termination of multiple bubbles, and proves consistency of this dating procedure. Simulations show that the test significantly improves discriminatory power and leads to distinct power gains when multiple bubbles occur. Empirical applications are conducted to S&P 500 stock market data over a long historical period from January 1871 to December 2010. The new approach identifies many key historical episodes of exuberance and collapse over this period, whereas the strategy of PWY and the CUSUM procedure locate far fewer episodes in the same sample range.

40|$|Recent work on econometric {{detection}} mechanisms {{has shown}} the effectiveness of recursive procedures in identifying and dating financial bubbles in real time. These procedures are useful as warning alerts in surveillance strategies conducted by central banks and <b>fiscal</b> <b>regulators</b> with real-time data. Use of these methods over long historical periods presents a more serious econometric challenge due {{to the complexity of}} the nonlinear structure and break mechanisms that are inherent in multiple-bubble phenomena within the same sample period. To meet this challenge, this article develops a new recursive flexible window method that is better suited for practical implementation with long historical time series. The method is a generalized version of the sup augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) test of Phillips et al. ("Explosive behavior in the 1990 s NASDAQ: When did exuberance escalate asset values?" International Economic Review 52 (2011), 201 – 26; PWY) and delivers a consistent real-time date-stamping strategy for the origination and termination of multiple bubbles. Simulations show that the test significantly improves discriminatory power and leads to distinct power gains when multiple bubbles occur. An empirical application of the methodology is conducted on S&P 500 stock market data over a long historical period from January 1871 to December 2010. The new approach successfully identifies the well-known historical episodes of exuberance and collapses over this period, whereas the strategy of PWY and a related cumulative sum (CUSUM) dating procedure locate far fewer episodes in the same sample range. 35 page(s...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{develops a}} model of banking regulation from a positive political economy perspective. The main characteristic of this model, based on the interrela-tion between regulators and incumbent banks, is that regulation is driven by public interest and political economy motives. The public interest of regulators includes the efficiency and soundness of the banking industry. The political economy motives con-sist of two elements. First, incumbent banks demand regulation to obtain higher than competitive profits (rent-seeking motive). Second, regulation by itself is rewarding for the regulator. In the model, the government finances the public-sector deficit with banking resources (<b>fiscal</b> motive). <b>Regulators</b> make use of two instruments. The first is to require banks to hold min-imum capital adequacy levels. Theory predicts that increasing bank capital {{reduces the risk of}} bank failure. The second instrument is the control of entry, which makes bank charters valuable, so banks follow a conservative behavior to protect their char-ters. Entry restrictions, however, {{have a negative impact on}} efficiency in the industry...|$|R
40|$|In {{the light}} of {{numerous}} debates around Russia’s dependence on crude oil and the necessity to diversify the Russian economy, the present paper investigates how closely federal budget revenues, structure of export basket and GDP growth in Russia are tied up with crude oil prices (POIL) {{on the one hand}} and the real effective exchange rate of ruble (REER) on the other. The study covers the period from 2000 :Q 1 till 2014 :Q 4 and employs index analysis along with vector error correction model (VECM) based on Johansen co‑integration technique. The calculated REER revealed its significant appreciation, that together with a high share of mineral products in total Russian exports points to Dutch disease presence. The constructed econometric models revealed the existence of long‑run relationships among the analyzed indicators. Post‑estimation tests proved the validity of the VECMs. According to the obtained results, in order to stimulate “non‑oil” exports monetary authorities should depreciate national currency, whilst fiscal burden should be mild towards “non oil” producers. However, the observed dynamics of macroeconomic indicators points to the fact that the Russian economy is still substantially influenced by POIL and this influence is much more stronger than it is exerted by <b>fiscal</b> and monetary <b>regulators.</b> It allows us to conclude that crude oil will continue to play, at least in foreseeable future, a dominant role in further development of the Russian economy...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} draw {{lessons from the}} IMF’s {{experience}} in handling financial crises around the globe {{over the past ten}} years that are relevant to the challenges faced by countries in Latin America, especially in the wake of the recent crisis in Argentina. Experience suggests that there is no quick or easy fix in the face of a wide-ranging crisis involving both acute external financing pressures and rapidly changing asset prices that undermine financial stability and household and corporate balance sheets. In the end, effective solutions depend on developing a comprehensive strategy combining the full range of fiscal, monetary, financial system, and debt policy instruments. Recent experience with crises has had important implications for the IMF’s work in assessing crisis vulnerabilities. IMF surveillance work has been strengthened and a more objective framework has been developed for assessing debt sustainability, and this approach continues to be refined.
