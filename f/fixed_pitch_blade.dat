Since rotor control technology is currently limited to controlling rotational speed and blade pitch, an increasing concern has been given to morphing blades. In this paper, a simplified morphing blade is introduced, which has a linear twist distribution along the span and a shape that can be controlled by adjusting the twist of the blade's root and tip. To evaluate the performance of wind turbine blades, a numerical code based on the blade element momentum theory is developed and validated. The blade of the NREL Phase VI wind turbine is taken as a reference blade and has a fixed pitch. The optimization problems associated with the control of the morphing blade and a blade with pitch control are formulated. The optimal results show that the morphing blade gives better results than the blade with pitch control in terms of produced power. Under the assumption that at a given site, the annual average wind speed is known and the wind speed follows a Rayleigh distribution, the annual energy production of wind turbines was evaluated for three types of blade, namely, morphing blade, blade with pitch control and <b>fixed</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>blade.</b> For an annual average wind speed varying between 5 m/s and 15 m/s, {{it turns out that the}} annual energy production of the wind turbine containing morphing blades is 24. 5 % to 69. 7 % higher than the annual energy production of the wind turbine containing pitch fixed blades. Likewise, the annual energy production of the wind turbine containing blades with pitch control is 22. 7 % to 66. 9 % higher than the annual energy production of the wind turbine containing pitch fixed blades...|$|E

40|$|Small Darrieus {{hydrokinetic}} turbines with <b>fixed</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>blades</b> typically {{suffer from}} poor starting torque, low efficiency and shaking due to large fluctuations in both radial and tangential force with azimuth angle. Efficiency improves as size increases, since adequate blade chord Reynolds numbers {{can be maintained}} with low solidity. Shaking can be eliminated by using helical blades, or reduced by using multiple blades. Starting torque can be marginally improved {{by the use of}} cambered blade profiles but may still be inadequate to overcome drive train friction for self-starting. Variable pitch can generate high starting torque, high efficiency and reduced shaking but active pitch control systems add considerably to complexity and cost, while passive systems must have effective pitch control to achieve higher efficiency than <b>fixed</b> <b>pitch</b> systems. ...|$|R
40|$|Three {{designs of}} a guyed {{cylindrical}} tower and its foundation for an intermediate size horizontal axis {{wind turbine generator}} are discussed. The primary difference in the three designs is the configuration of the rotor. Two configurations are two-blade rotors with teetering hubs - one with full span pitchable blades, the other with <b>fixed</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>blades.</b> The third configuration is a three-bladed rotor with a rigid hub and <b>fixed</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>blades.</b> In all configurations the diameter of the rotor is 38 meters and the axis of rotation is 30. 4 meters above grade, and the power output is 200 kW and 400 kW. For each configuration the design is based upon for the most severe loading condition either operating wind or hurricane conditions. The diameter of the tower is selected to be 1. 5 meters (since it was determined that this would provide sufficient space for access ladders within the tower) with guy rods attached at 10. 7 meters above grade. Completing a design requires selecting the required thicknesses of the various cylindrical segments, the number and diameter of the guy rods, the number and size of soil anchors, {{and the size of the}} central foundation. The lower natural frequencies of vibration are determined for each design to ensure that operation near resonance does not occur. Finally, a cost estimate is prepared for each design. A preliminary design and cost estimate of a cantilever tower (cylindrical and not guyed) and its foundation is also presented for each of the three configurations...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{objective was to}} investigate the generation and collection of power generated in a distributed tidal generation site, and realise the most economic grid connection methodology for a practical installation. Current tidal steam prototype designs utilise variable speed gear boxes, power frequency converters and variable <b>pitch</b> <b>blades</b> in the nacelle, thus requiring complicated, heavy and expensive equipment in the nacelle. Moreover the variable <b>blade</b> <b>pitch</b> mechanism has a large power demand, and has to operate day after day submerged in water at depths between 30 m – 80 m. The approach taken in this research is to replace major cost components with much cheaper ones, as well as locating as many components as possible onshore where costs are less. This thesis investigates a novel tidal stream power generation system referred to as “passive rectification to a common DC-bus” where an array of 3 -phase synchronous generators operating at diverse speeds are connected to a common DC bus via passive diode rectifiers. The proposed tidal stream topology shows that variable <b>pitched</b> <b>blades,</b> variable speed gearboxes and frequency converters in the nacelle can be replaced by a much simpler system that uses <b>fixed</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>blades,</b> a <b>fixed</b> ratio gearbox, generator excitation control system, and a diode bridge rectifier. These components are generally cheaper, lighter, have a lower power demand and are more reliable than the components they replace. Also some of the voltage and frequency conversion is carried out ashore where costs are less, in addition to the overall {{reduction in the number of}} components required as some of the components are shared by multiple devices. As a result system efficiency is maximised, in addition to facilitating a reduction in capital, installation and operational costs. Power conversion from the tidal generation power system to shore is achieved via passive rectification to a common DC-bus, thus system power regulation is achieved by individual generator field current control, to attain optimum system operation including, maximum power extraction, power limitation and stall control, in turn improving system reliability and controllability. Furthermore passive stall control via generator field current regulation eliminates the need for mechanical brakes which reduces cost and improves reliability. The feasibility of the proposed power generation system was carried out via computer simulations and later validated via small scale laboratory hardware simulations. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. As Development {{of small}} {{vertical}} axis wind turbines (VAWT) for urban use {{is becoming an}} interesting topic both within industry and academia. However, there are few new designs of vertical axis turbines which are customized for building integration. These are getting importance because they operate at low rotational speed producing very less noise during operation, although these are less efficient than Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines (HAWT). The efficiency of a VAWT has been significantly improved by H-Darrieus VAWT design based on double airfoil technology {{as demonstrated by the}} authors in a previous publication. Further, it is well know that the variation of the <b>blade</b> <b>pitch</b> angle during the rotation improves the power efficiency. A <b>blade</b> <b>pitch</b> variation is implemented by active <b>blade</b> <b>pitch</b> control, which operates as per wind speed and position of the blade with respect to the rotor. A double multiple stream tube method is used to determine the performance of the H-Darrieus VAWT. The power coefficient is compared with that of a <b>fixed</b> <b>pitch</b> and a variable <b>pitch</b> double airfoil <b>blade</b> VAWT. It is demonstrated that an improvement in power coefficient by 20 % is achieved and the turbine could start at low wind speed...|$|R

40|$|Tidal stream {{turbines}} {{have the}} potential to generate electricity from a renewable source that is highly predictable and non-polluting. The United Kingdom’s geographical location means that it {{has one of the most}} significant wave and tidal resources in the world. The implications of controlling horizontal axial flow, variable speed tidal stream turbines for the purpose of optimising energy capture, regulating power and reducing mechanical loads has been investigated. The research was separated into two main areas: control of the turbine in below rated flow speeds where the objective was to maximise energy capture, and control of the turbine in high flow speeds where the aim was to regulate power, shed load and ensure the survivability of the turbine. A control strategy that maximises the power output of a tidal stream turbine in below rated flow speeds, by allowing the rotor speed to be varied, was implemented. The performance of the control strategy was assessed in simulation and then implemented on a hardware in the loop test rig. In both cases the controller performed well and was able to maximise power output from the turbine by varying the rotor speed to maintain the optimum tip speed ratio. Two control strategies for regulating the output power from a tidal stream turbine in high flow speeds were investigated and compared. The first strategy relies on adjusting the pitch angle of the rotor blades to regulate power and the second assumes <b>fixed</b> <b>pitch</b> rotor <b>blades</b> and relies on the stall characteristic of the blades to regulate power. Models of both the pitch and stall regulated turbines were developed and simulated using the commercially available software GH Tidal Bladed®. The control system design behind both strategies was developed in Matlab. Following control implementation a comparison of each model was carried out in terms of performance under turbulent flows, loading and energy yield. Following the comparison it was concluded that the performance of the pitch regulated tidal stream turbine was superior to that of the stall regulated turbine. The research also revealed that the dynamics of each turbine model are significantly different for above rated flow speed operation. This has implications on controller design and loading experienced by each tidal stream turbin...|$|R
