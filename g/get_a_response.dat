500|$|Megan Fox was {{originally}} {{attached to the}} film, and Patrick Dempsey's role as Dylan Gould {{was to be the}} employer of Fox's character, Mikaela Banes. According to various published sources, Fox's absence from the film was due to Bay ultimately choosing not to renew her role in light of her comparing him and his work ethics to Adolf Hitler, although representatives for the actress said that it was her decision to leave the film franchise. Bay later claimed that Fox was fired by executive producer Steven Spielberg, a claim which Spielberg denied. [...] "I wasn't hurt", Bay stated, [...] "because I know that's just Megan. Megan loves to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>response.</b> And she does it in kind of the wrong way. I'm sorry, Megan. I'm sorry I made you work twelve hours. I'm sorry that I'm making you show up on time.

2500|$|Throughout the protests, {{a common}} tactic that has divided {{opinions}} among Venezuelans and the anti-government opposition has been erecting burning street barricades, colloquially known as guarimbas. Street barricades, which stop vehicles from passing, violate the 50th article {{of the constitution}} of Venezuela, which grants the right of free transit. Initially, these barricades consisted of piles of trash and cardboard set on fire at night, and were easily removed by Venezuelan security forces. Guarimbas have since evolved into [...] "fortress-like structures" [...] of bricks, mattresses, wooden planks and barbed wire guarded by protestors, who [...] "have to resort to guerrilla-style tactics to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>response</b> from the government of President Nicolas Maduro". [...] However, their use is controversial. Critics claim guarimbas, which are primarily erected in residential areas, victimize local residents and businesses and have little political impact.|$|E

On July 25, 1972 word of the Tuskegee Study was reported by Jean Heller of the Associated Press; the next day the New York Times carried it on its front page, and the story captured national attention. Peter Buxtun, a whistleblower who was a former PHS interviewer for venereal disease, had leaked information after failing to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>response</b> to his protests about the study within the department. He gave information to the Washington Star and the New York Times. John R. Heller Jr. of PHS, who in later years of the study led the national division, still defended the ethics of the study, stating: [...] "The longer the study, the better the ultimate information we would derive." [...] Author James Jones editorialized about Heller, suggesting that his opinion was: [...] "The men's status did not warrant ethical debate.
