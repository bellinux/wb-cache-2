2500|$|The {{oxidizing}} flame {{is the third}} possible flame adjustment. It occurs when the ratio of oxygen to acetylene required for a neutral flame has been changed to give an excess of oxygen. This flame type is observed when welders add more oxygen to the neutral flame. This flame is hotter {{than the other two}} flames because the combustible gases will not have to search so far to find the necessary amount of oxygen, nor heat up as much thermally inert carbon. It is called an {{oxidizing flame}} because of its effect on metal. This flame adjustment is generally not preferred. The oxidizing flame creates undesirable oxides to the structural and mechanical detriment of most metals. In an oxidizing flame, the inner cone acquires a purplish tinge, gets pinched and smaller at the tip, {{and the sound of the}} flame gets harsh.

The microstructures of all joint types and tensile properties of <b>fusion</b> <b>welds</b> and braze joints were characterized.

Incorporating this technology may improve service performance and enable reduction of manufacturing time and cost. This program of research has employed miniature tensile sample designs to examine the distributions of longitudinal properties through the various regimes in a <b>fusion</b> <b>weld.</b> Also, the distributions of both longitudinal and transverse properties throughout the stir zones for selected FSP conditions were examined. Yield strengths were larger in various FSP conditions by at least a factor of two relative to <b>fusion</b> <b>welds.</b> Ultimate strengths were comparable in the weld pool and stir nugget.

Unlike <b>fusion</b> <b>weld</b> processes such as tungsten inert gas (TIG), variable polarity plasma arc (VPPA), electron beam (EB), etc., solid state {{welding processes}} do not melt the material during welding. The resultant microstructure can be characterized as a dynamically recrystallized morphology much different than the casted, dentritic structure typical of <b>fusion</b> <b>weld</b> processes. The primary benefits of solid state processes over <b>fusion</b> <b>weld</b> processes include superior mechanic properties and the elimination of thermal distortion and residual stresses. These solid state processes attributes have profoundly influenced the direction of advanced welding research and development within the NASA agency. Thermal Stir Welding (TSW) is a new solid state welding process being developed at the Marshall Space Flight Center. Unlike friction stir welding, the heating, stirring and forging elements of the weld process can be decoupled for independent control. An induction coil induces energy into a workpiece to attain a desired plastic temperature. An independently controlled stir rod, captured within non-rotating containment plates, then stirs the plasticized material followed by forging plates/rollers that work the stirred weld joint. The independent control (decoupling) of heating, stirring and forging allows, theoretically, for the precision control of microstructure morphology. The TSW process is being used to evaluate the solid state joining of Haynes 230 for ARES J- 2 X applications. It is also being developed for 500 -in (12. 5 mm) thick commercially pure grade 2 titanium for navy applications. Other interests include Inconel 718 and stainless steel.

40|$|We {{present a}} brief résumé {{of the history}} of {{solidification}} research and key factors affecting the solidification of <b>fusion</b> <b>welds.</b> There is a general agreement of the basic solidification theory, albeit differing - even confusing - nomenclatures do exist, and Cases 2 and 3 (the Chalmers' basic boundary conditions for solidification, categorized by Savage as Cases) are variably emphasized. Model Frame, a tool helping to model the continuum of <b>fusion</b> <b>weld</b> solidification from start to end, is proposed. It incorporates the general solidification models, of which the pertinent ones are selected for the actual modeling. The basic models are the main solidification Cases 1 … 4. These discrete Cases are joined with Sub-Cases: models of Pfann, Flemings and others, bringing needed Sub-Case variables into the model. Model Frame depicts a grain growing from the weld interface to its centerline. Besides modeling, the Model Frame supports education and academic debate. The new mathematical modeling techniques will extend its use into multi-dimensional modeling, introducing new variables and increasing the modeling accuracy. We propose a model: melting/solidification-model (M/S-model) - predicting the solute profile {{at the start of the}} solidification of a <b>fusion</b> <b>weld.</b> This Case 3 -based Sub-Case takes into account the melting stage, the solute back-diffusion in the solid, and the growth rate acceleration typical to <b>fusion</b> <b>welds.</b> We propose - based on works of Rutter & Chalmers, David & Vitek and our experimental results on copper - that NEGS-EGS-transition is not associated only with cellular-dendritic-transition. Solidification is studied experimentally on pure and doped copper with welding speed range from 0 to 200 cm/min, with one test at 3000 cm/min. Found were only planar and cellular structures, no dendrites - columnar or equiaxed. Cell sub structures: rows of cubic elements we call "cubelettes", "cell-bands" and "micro-cells", as well as an anomalous crack morphology "crack-eye", were detected, as well as microscopic hot crack nucleus we call "grain-lag cracks", caused by a grain slightly lagging behind its neighbors in arrival to the weld centerline. Varestraint test and R-test revealed a change of crack morphologies from centerline cracks to grainand cell boundary cracks with an increasing welding speed. High speed made the cracks invisible to bare eye and hardly detectable with light microscope, while electron microscope often revealed networks of fine micro-cracks...|$|R
