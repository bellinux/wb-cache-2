He became a <b>knowledgeable</b> <b>and</b> respected collector, accumulating a priceless collection of paintings, drawings, manuscripts and miniatures over 50 years. He had also gathered a collection of primitive and African art which he sold sometime prior to 1985.|$|E
5|$|In 1949 Palmer left Ziff-Davis and was {{replaced}} by Howard Browne, who was <b>knowledgeable</b> <b>and</b> enthusiastic about fantasy fiction. Browne briefly managed {{to improve the quality of}} the fiction in Fantastic Adventures, and the period around 1951 has been described as the magazine's heyday. Browne lost interest when his plan to take Amazing Stories upmarket collapsed, and the magazine fell back into predictability. In 1952, Ziff-Davis launched another fantasy magazine, titled Fantastic, in a digest format; it was successful, and within a few months the decision was taken to end Fantastic Adventures in favor of Fantastic. The March 1953 issue of Fantastic Adventures was the last.|$|E
5|$|To his supporters, Quisling was {{regarded}} as a conscientious administrator of the highest order, <b>knowledgeable</b> <b>and</b> with an eye for detail. Balanced and gentle to a fault, they believed he cared deeply about his people and maintained high moral standards throughout. To his opponents, Quisling was unstable and undisciplined, abrupt, even threatening. Quite possibly he was both, at ease among friends and under pressure when confronted with his political opponents, and generally shy and retiring with both. During formal dinners he often said nothing at all except for the occasional cascade of dramatic rhetoric. Indeed, he did not react well to pressure and would often let slip over-dramatic sentiments when put on the spot. Normally open to criticism, he was prone to assuming larger groups were conspiratorial.|$|E

40|$|A {{critical}} issue for intelligent tutoring systems is whether <b>knowledgeable</b> diagnosis <b>and</b> feedback offers instructional benefits compared with less knowledge-intensive instructional methods. The effectiveness of different instructional methods is examined in a device operation task: setting a VCR {{to record a}} program. Four tutoring simulations use different instructional approaches emphasizing specific types of knowledge. The possibility of acquiring this knowledge is manipulated by increasing opportunities {{to interact with the}} simulation and by explicitly providing <b>knowledgeable</b> diagnosis <b>and</b> feedback. Eighty novice adults were randomly assigned to the four tutors for training. Planned comparisons of learner achievement indicate greater learning with <b>knowledgeable</b> diagnosis <b>and</b> feedback, compared to correctness feedback. Analysis of variance to detect predicted linear trends shows increased instructional effectiveness across versions. Results are not simply a function of differences in training time. They support the contention that <b>knowledgeable</b> diagnosis <b>and</b> feedback can offer benefits over other instructional methods...|$|R

25|$|Initially {{introduced}} as a supporting {{character in the}} first game, he {{has been one of}} the primary antagonists throughout the series, where he usually manipulates story events behind-the-scenes. Power-hungry, <b>knowledgeable</b> <b>and</b> infinitely cunning, he was a man who sought to replace the entire human race through mass extinction and forced evolution, believing humanity to be an evolutionary dead-end. To this end, he was affiliated with the Umbrella Corporation as one of its most promising researchers, and at the same time participated in illicit activities by going undercover as S.T.A.R.S. captain in Raccoon City. Through the course of much betrayal of his allies to further his own plans, Wesker fakes his death, gains superhuman strength, speed & regeneration from an experimental variant of the Progenitor virus, and works alongside both Umbrella's mysterious rival company and their successors in the field of biological weapons development, TRICELL, until his ultimate defeat in Resident Evil 5.|$|E
25|$|Although the Council of State {{was never}} convened, {{several of its}} members were {{nonetheless}} close advisers to the king. Alongside Diogo de Mendonça Corte-Real, Cardinal João da Mota e Silva and High-Inquisitor Nuno da Cunha e Ataíde were close advisers to the king, the former eventually substituting Mendonça Corte-Real as Secretary of State {{when he died in}} 1736. Though he disbanded most institutions, John notably maintained the Junta of the Three Estates, a governing junta created by John's grandfather, King John IV, which managed the finances and maintenance of military installations, troop raising, and taxation related to defense. Having engaged in multiple conflicts throughout his reign, both in Europe and his empire, John understood the necessity of the junta and carefully picked its members, only selecting those deemed the most <b>knowledgeable</b> <b>and</b> competent. Similarly, John maintained the Council of the Treasury, which managed the finances of Portugal and its empire, including tax collection and budget accounting for the majority of Portugal's organizations (notably excusing the military), and exerted authority over the Casa da Índia, the Royal Mint, and the custom houses across Portuguese territory.|$|E
25|$|Following {{a social}} {{identity}} approach, Reysen and Katzarska-Miller tested a model showing the antecedents and outcomes of global citizenship identification (i.e., degree of psychological connection with global citizens). Individuals’ normative environment (the cultural {{environment in which}} one is embedded contains people, artifacts, cultural patterns that promote viewing the self as a global citizen) and global awareness (perceiving oneself as aware, <b>knowledgeable,</b> <b>and</b> connected {{to others in the}} world) predict global citizenship identification. Global citizenship identification then predicts six broad categories of prosocial behaviors and values, including: intergroup empathy, valuing diversity, social justice, environmental sustainability, intergroup helping, and a felt responsibility to act. Subsequent research has examined variables that influence the model such as: participation in a college course with global components, perception of one’s global knowledge, college professors' attitudes toward global citizenship, belief in an intentional worlds view of culture, participation in a fan group that promotes the identity, use of global citizen related words when describing one's values, possible self as a global citizen, religiosity and religious orientation, threat to one’s nation, interdependent self-construal prime, perception of the university environment, and social media usage.|$|E

500|$|Stengel had {{approached}} the new {{manager of the}} Dodgers, Max Carey, an old teammate from his time with the Pirates, seeking a job, and was hired as first base coach. Stengel thus ended an exile of seven years from the major leagues: Appel suggested that Stengel's reputation as a clown inhibited owners from hiring him although {{he was known as}} <b>knowledgeable</b> <b>and</b> able to manage the press. Sportswriter Dan Daniel described Stengel's hiring as [...] "the return of an ancient Flatbush landmark", which might satisfy old Dodger fans upset at Robinson's dismissal at the end of 1931. Brooklyn finished third and then sixth with Stengel in the first base coaching box. Among the players was catcher Al Lopez; the two became close friends and would be managing rivals in the 1950s American League.|$|E
500|$|Initially, Jefferson and Hamilton {{enjoyed a}} {{friendly}} working relationship. While never close, they seldom clashed {{during the first}} year in the Washington administration. Even so, deep philosophical differences soon caused a rift between them, and finally drove them apart. Hamilton believed that a vigorous use of the central government was essential for the task of nation building. He also believed that [...] "a flourishing merchant economy would sow opportunities for all, resulting in a more philanthropic, <b>knowledgeable</b> <b>and</b> enterprising people." [...] In Jefferson's view, centralized government was [...] "simply European-style tyranny waiting to happen again." [...] He idealized the yeoman farmers, for they [...] "controlled their own destinies, and also a republic that, resting on the yeoman farmer, would keep 'alive that sacred fire' of personal liberty and virtue."

500|$|On {{his return}} to the United States after the June 1939 IOC session in London, Brundage {{systematically}} set about becoming a major collector of Asian art. The unsettled conditions caused wealthy Chinese to sell family heirlooms, and prices were depressed, making it an opportune moment to collect. He bought many books on Asian art, stating in an interview that a [...] "major library is an indispensable tool". After the US entered World WarII, stock owned by Japanese dealers in the United States was impounded; Brundage was able to purchase the best items. Dealers found him willing to spend money, but <b>knowledgeable</b> <b>and</b> a hard bargainer. Brundage rarely was fooled by forgeries, and was undeterred by the few he did buy, noting that in Asian art, fake pieces were often a thousand years old. In his 1948 article on Brundage for Life, Butterfield noted that [...] "his collection is {{regarded as one of the}} largest and most important in private hands in this country".|$|E
