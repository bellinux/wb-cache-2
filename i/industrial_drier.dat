40|$|This paper {{presents}} a project-based learning laboratory {{for the teaching}} of embedded systems. The main objectives are to encourage students studying the embedded systems course in developing hardware solutions for real engineering problems and to include aspects of other courses studied within the academic programmes. One of the aims of project-based learning (PRBL) is to integrate different courses in the achievement of a common objective, within a multidisciplinary course of the academic programme. In the present case, this module is the final project of the embedded systems course. The project in question concerns a temperature control system for an <b>industrial</b> <b>drier,</b> equipped with a remote system for configuration and data acquisition. The design of the drier, as well as elaboration of the entire electronic system involving drivers and sensors, was undertaken by the students using a kit with a microcontroller specific {{for the development of}} embedded systems. The results of opinion surveys conducted with the students following implementation of the PRBL proposal were used to validate the procedure. Full details of the development and results of the project are provided, with the aim of assisting professors and students of similar courses...|$|E
40|$|Based on the {{principle}} of similarity, the wood drying process can be investigated on a scale model, which is the laboratory drier, instead of the full-size <b>industrial</b> <b>drier.</b> Thus, the investigation is simplified and the drying time reduced. The laboratory drying kiln, developed by the research team, is a controlled climate air duct with closed circuit, fitted with a rectangular test section. The air flow is circulated by a centrifugal fan and the air heating is carried out by a set of electric resistances. The selection of the fan and of the heating resistances was performed according to the aerodynamic and thermal calculations, presented in the paper. For the air humidification, in accordance to the drying schedule requirements, the drier has a steam generator that prepares steam which is injected in the air. The wood sample is placed within the drier on a device conceived for both sample support and vertical motion and also, for continuous weighing. By applying {{the principle}} of similarity for both, the industrial kiln and the laboratory drier, the required air velocity for the laboratory drier is determined, for constant values of the temperature and relative humidity of air. Different invariants,characteristic to the drying schedule that was applied, have been also calculated...|$|E
40|$|Many coated {{products}} {{are made by}} spreading a solution, prepared by dissolving a polymer in a solvent, on a substrate and then removing the solvent from the solution by blowing jets of hot air across it, from the bottom and the top, in multi-zone driers. Air flow, its temperature and its degree of saturation with the solvent constitute important operating conditions in every zone of an <b>industrial</b> <b>drier.</b> Air flow and its temperature can be manipulated easily in each zone to meet the goal of removing the solvent to specified levels without inducing any defects. Drying of polymeric coatings in multi-zone driers, with each zone operated at different air flow and temperature, involves simultaneous mass and heat transport and shrinkage because of solvent evaporation. Mathematical modeling (Alsoy and Duda, 1998; Price and Cairncross, 2000) has been used extensively to study drying. Fick’s law with a diffusion coefficient predicted by free volume theory (Vrentas and Duda, 1977 a, b) describes mass transport in the coating. A lumped model describes heat transport in the coating ignoring change in temperature across coating thickness and, shrinkage is obtained by solvent mass balance. We model poly (vinyl acetate) / toluene system in a two-zone drier. Improper choice of operating conditions can create defects such as blisters, mottle, warping, crazing, and cracking. In this work, only blister formation during drying is considered. Blisters are created whenever the solvent partial pressure in the coating exceeds ambient pressure in the drier (Price and Cairncross, 2000). Intense operatin...|$|E

40|$|Accurate {{predictions}} of convective heat and mass transfer at air–porous material interfaces are essential in many engineering applications, one example being optimisation of industrial drying processes {{with respect to}} energy consumption and product quality. For porous-material modelling purposes, simplified convective transfer coefficients (CTCs) are often used to avoid explicit air-flow modelling. Alternatively, conjugate models have been introduced recently and are being more widely used. Conjugate modelling has the advantage {{that it does not}} require the use of CTCs or of the heat and mass transfer analogy. Instead, these CTCs can be identified a-posteriori. In this study, an overview of the existing methods to predict convective heat and mass transfer at air–porous material interfaces is given, with a specific focus on conjugate modelling. The improved accuracy of this approach is indicated based on two case studies, namely hygroscopic loading and convective drying. A large spatial and temporal variability of the CTCs is found by means of conjugate modelling. This approach provides increased accuracy, which is especially relevant for complex flow problems, such as in <b>industrial</b> <b>drier</b> systems. However, the sensitivity to the convective boundary conditions can be limited in some cases, e. g. for hygroscopic loading. Instead of improving accuracy significantly here, conjugate modelling will rather impose an additional modelling effort, which often requires conjugate model code development as these models are not readily available. Before embarking on a conjugate modelling study, it is advised to perform a sensitivity analysis with respect to the convective boundary conditions: in some cases, sufficient accuracy can be obtained using empirical CTCs from literature...|$|E

40|$|Saving {{energy is}} {{considered}} about by much more people nowadays. The energy use of <b>industrial</b> <b>drying</b> occupies {{a large part}} of total energy usage. Not only the governments, but also the industry owners are trying to find ways to cut down the usage of energy. The aim of this work is to find suitable technologies for <b>industrial</b> <b>drying</b> of berries which can be energy-efficient at the same time. More specifically, to find suitable dryers for drying aronia berry in Sweden. The research is based on secondary data collected by literature review. Good options for other circumstances like fluidized bed drying, freeze drying and solar drying were not discussed in detail. After the study, a continuous hot air dryer with explosion puffing system and heat pumping system seems to be the best solution for drying aronia berry in Sweden. It is easy to be controlled, cost acceptable (both capital and operational costs), environmental friendly and has high drying rate and high product quality. The extra means for improve drying process such as combined with dielectric or conductive dryer, adding pre-treatment such as osmotic drying were also discussed. Combined dryers can reduce the drying time and osmotic drying can cut the operation cost.
