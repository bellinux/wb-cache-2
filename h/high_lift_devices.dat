25|$|After {{the arrival}} of the first {{production}} 707 in 1957 the Dash 80 was adapted into a general experimental aircraft and used by Boeing to test a variety of new technologies and systems.

30|$|In this study, {{we propose}} a {{mechanism}} that compensates for {{the reduction of}} the SUAV’s L/D ratio in the low-speed range. If the <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> <b>device</b> that can increase L/D is achieved in small size for the SUAV, the SUAV can conduct various tasks with more payload. The {{purpose of this study is}} improving the L/D in case that Re = 105 condition with SUAV in order to increase L/D in case of take-off, landing and flight with high angle of attack. Several high-lift devices that compensate for the reduced L/D have been developed and employed. In addition, in order to reduce the risk of stalling by the influence of wind or operational errors, we conduct with the improvement of the stall characteristics to increase the angle of attack. In the next section, some typical systems are examined.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to improve}} aerodynamic {{performance of a}} <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> system by means of implementing a novel concept (referred to as the ap extension) {{on the leading edge}} of the ap of a three element <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> <b>device.</b> The concept is optimised using two optimisation approaches based on Genetic Algorithm optimisations. A zero order approach which makes simplifying assumptions to achieve an optimised solution: and a direct approach which employs an optimisation in ANSYS DesignXplorer using RANS calculations. The concept was seen to increase lift locally at the ap. The solution to the zero order optimisation showed a decreased stall angle and decreased maximum lift coe cient due to early stall onset at the ap. The DesignXplorer optimised solution matched that of the baseline solution very closely. Computational Aeroacoustic simulations were performed using the DES model in 2 D on the baseline and DesignXplorer optimised solution.

40|$|A {{generalized}} {{wind tunnel}} model was tested to investigate new component concepts utilizing spanwise blowing to provide improved maneuver characteristics for advanced fighter aircraft. Primary {{emphasis was placed on}} high angle of attack performance, stability, and control at subsonic speeds. Spanwise blowing on a 44 deg swept trapezoidal wing resulted in leading edge vortex enhancement with subsequent large vortex-induced lift increments and drag polar improvements at the higher angles of attack. Small deflections of a leading edge flap delayed these lift and drag benefits to higher angles of attack. In addition, blowing was more effective at higher Mach numbers. Spanwise blowing in conjunction with a deflected trailing edge flap resulted in lift and drag benefits that exceeded the summation of the effects of each <b>high</b> <b>lift</b> <b>device</b> acting alone. Asymmetric blowing was an effective lateral control device at the higher angles of attack.

The decision to use the existing Astra SPX wing imposed a limit on maximum size, but allowed for a fuselage large enough to accommodate three-abreast seating. The main change from the Astra SPX wing was the introduction of Krueger flaps on the leading edges of the inboard section.
