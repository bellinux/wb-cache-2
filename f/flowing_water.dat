5|$|Compared to {{the other}} crested newt species, the Danube crested newt is more adapted to life along a river system and {{frequently}} occurs in <b>flowing</b> <b>water</b> and together with fish. Typical breeding sites are slow-flowing river margins, oxbow lakes, flooded marshland, larger ponds, or ditches, provided abundant underwater vegetation is available. During land phase, the newts live in deciduous forests or groves, bushlands, or meadows.|$|E

5|$|It {{spends a}} great deal of time in or near the water of wide rivers, preferring shallow, clear streams with {{compacted}} and sandy bottoms. The wood turtle can also be found in forests and grasslands, but will rarely be seen more than several hundred meters from <b>flowing</b> <b>water.</b> It is diurnal and is not overtly territorial. It spends the winter in hibernation and the hottest parts of the summer in estivation.|$|E
5|$|Frogs in the genera Heleioporus and Neobatrachus lack vocal sacs but {{can still}} produce a loud call. Their buccal cavity is {{enlarged}} and dome-shaped, {{acting as a}} resonance chamber that amplifies the sound. Species of frog that lack vocal sacs and {{that do not have}} a loud call tend to inhabit areas close to constantly noisy, <b>flowing</b> <b>water.</b> They need to use an alternative means to communicate. The coastal tailed frog (Ascaphus truei) lives in mountain streams in North America and does not vocalize.|$|E
5|$|Hydroelectricity is {{the term}} {{referring}} to electricity generated by hydropower; the production of electrical power {{through the use of}} the gravitational force of falling or <b>flowing</b> <b>water.</b> In 2015 hydropower generated 16.6% of the worlds total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity and is expected to increase about 3.1% each year for the next 25 years. Hydroelectric plants have the advantage of being long-lived and many existing plants have operated for more than 100 years.|$|E

5|$|Soldiers at {{the base}} noticed warning signs, {{including}} groups of men watching the construction from the nearby village, which was set at a higher elevation than the outpost, and other groups of men moving through nearby mountains. At a dinner meeting in the village, a villager told the Americans that they should shoot any men seen in the mountains, and asked them if U.S. UAVs were keeping watch nearby. The day before the attack, the militants began <b>flowing</b> <b>water</b> through an irrigation ditch feeding an unused field, creating background noise that masked {{the sounds of the}} advancing fighters.|$|E
5|$|The aquatic {{habitats}} {{preferred by}} the newts are stagnant, mid- to large-sized, unshaded water bodies with abundant underwater vegetation but without fish, which prey on larvae. Typical examples are larger ponds, which {{need not be}} of natural origin; indeed, most ponds inhabited by the northern crested newt in the UK are human-made. Examples of other suitable secondary habitats are ditches, channels, gravel pit lakes, garden ponds, or (in the Italian crested newt) rice paddies. The Danube crested newt is more adapted to <b>flowing</b> <b>water</b> and often breeds in river margins, oxbow lakes or flooded marshland, where it frequently co-occurs with fish. Other newts {{that can be found}} in syntopy with Triturus species include the smooth, the palmate, the Carpathian, and the alpine newt.|$|E
5|$|The nuckelavee is {{the most}} malevolent of the demons {{in and around the}} Scottish islands, without any redeeming characteristics. The only entity able to control it is the Mither o' the Sea, an ancient spirit in Orcadian mythology who keeps the nuckelavee {{confined}} during the summer months. In common with other mythical sea monsters, {{with the possible exception of}} kelpies and the nuggle of Shetland, it is unable to wade through fresh <b>flowing</b> <b>water,</b> therefore it can be escaped by crossing a stream. Tammas managed to escape from the nuckelavee after he inadvertently splashed it with water from the loch he was alongside; this briefly distracted the monster, allowing Tammas to run over to a nearby channel of fresh water and jump to safety on the opposite bank.|$|E

5|$|The {{old town}} {{comprises}} {{a large number}} of medieval and Renaissance buildings. The quai des Tanneurs ("tanners' quay") {{is one of the most}} picturesque streets in Alsace. A stream used to flow in the middle of the street until the beginning of the 20th century, the relic of a former noxious-smelling trade, since tanning required large amounts of <b>flowing</b> <b>water</b> for treating and washing animal skins. Most of the old tanner houses date back to the Middle Ages and have a tall attic to provide a ventilated space for drying leather. In the neighbouring streets, rue des Oies ("geese street") and rue des Veaux ("calf street"), many houses were covered with a coat of plaster in the 19th century in order to hide the timbering, which was considered too rustic.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{power is}} usually {{generated}} by electro-mechanical generators driven by steam produced from fossil fuel combustion, or the heat released from nuclear reactions; or {{from other sources}} such as kinetic energy extracted from wind or <b>flowing</b> <b>water.</b> The modern steam turbine invented by Sir Charles Parsons in 1884 today generates about 80 percent of the electric {{power in the world}} using a variety of heat sources. Such generators bear no resemblance to Faraday's homopolar disc generator of 1831, but they still rely on his electromagnetic principle that a conductor linking a changing magnetic field induces a potential difference across its ends. The invention {{in the late nineteenth century}} of the transformer meant that electrical power could be transmitted more efficiently at a higher voltage but lower current. Efficient electrical transmission meant in turn that electricity could be generated at centralised power stations, where it benefited from economies of scale, and then be despatched relatively long distances to where it was needed.|$|E
5|$|One such {{case is a}} genus of shellfish, Lampsilis, which {{feeds on}} the gills of fish in the larval stage of their development. Once they mature, they leave the fish as adult mollusc. Gaining entry into the host {{is not an easy}} task though, despite the fact that several hundred {{thousand}} larvae are released at once. This is especially the case in <b>flowing</b> <b>water</b> bodies such as streams, where they cannot lie on the substrate and wait to be taken up in the course of foraging. Female Lampsilis have evolved a special technique for delivering their offspring into a suitable host, however. Structures {{on the edge of the}} mantle are able to capture the interest of fish. Some resemble small fish themselves, with eye spots, a 'tail' and horizontal stripes, and may even move in a similar fashion, as if facing the current (rheotaxis). When overshadowed by a fish, the larvae are forcefully expelled, becoming ectoparasites on their unsuspecting host.|$|E

5|$|Within {{weeks of}} the storm, the Alligator Rivers Region Advisory Committee began {{planting}} seedlings in deforested areas. By August 2006, {{a review of the}} growth of the new plants found that 81% to 88% of the seeds had survived and begun growing. To fully restore the South Alligator valley, environmentalists requested A$7.4million (US$6.6million) in funds. In a study at Magela Creek a year after the storm, it was determined that between 8% and 19% of the tree canopy lost due to the storm had begun to recover. Additional studies at the Gulungul Creek and the Alligator Rivers region revealed that suspended sediment values in <b>flowing</b> <b>water</b> had temporarily increased in the wake of Monica. The above-average values persisted for roughly a year before the streams returned to pre-cyclone sediment levels. In a study of the Arnhem forests which were devastated by the cyclone, environmentalists reported that it would take over 100years for the forest to recover. The storm's winds snapped numerous trees, estimated to have been over 200 years old and more than 60cm (23.6in) in diameter. It is estimated that it would take several hundred years before trees of similar sizes would flourish in the region.|$|E
5|$|Deserts {{are formed}} by {{weathering}} processes as large {{variations in temperature}} between day and night put strains on the rocks which consequently break in pieces. Although rain seldom occurs in deserts, there are occasional downpours that can result in flash floods. Rain falling on hot rocks can cause them to shatter and the resulting fragments and rubble strewn over the desert floor is further eroded by the wind. This picks up particles of sand and dust and wafts them aloft in sand or dust storms. Wind-blown sand grains striking any solid object in their path can abrade the surface. Rocks are smoothed down, and the wind sorts sand into uniform deposits. The grains end up as level sheets of sand or are piled high in billowing sand dunes. Other deserts are flat, stony plains where all the fine material has been blown away and the surface consists of a mosaic of smooth stones. These areas are known as desert pavements and little further erosion takes place. Other desert features include rock outcrops, exposed bedrock and clays once deposited by <b>flowing</b> <b>water.</b> Temporary lakes may form and salt pans may be left when waters evaporate. There may be underground sources {{of water in the}} form of springs and seepages from aquifers. Where these are found, oases can occur.|$|E

40|$|Velocity of <b>flow</b> <b>water</b> in {{a channel}} will {{increase}} {{when there are}} different between water level at upstream and downstream of a channel. High velocity of <b>flow</b> <b>water</b> can be possessed by <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> in a spillway which the flow {{is caused by the}} gravitational force. A high velocity of <b>flow</b> <b>water</b> could possibly cause bad impacts such as erosion and scouring of riverbed and bank. Besides, this problem could also cause some destruction to the hydraulic structure like spillway and stilling basin. Regarding to this matter, the suitable precaution method need to be considered in order to control the high velocity of <b>flow</b> <b>water.</b> Therefore, a rectangular open channel model structure (40 cm x 60 cm) consists of spillway and stilling basin parts is constructed and used to conduct an experiment to study the performances and effectiveness of rectangular and cylindrical concrete blocks as energy dissipation structures. In this study, concrete blocks are arranged in row arrangement and various pattern of arrangements in spillway and stilling basin of a channel. The <b>water</b> <b>flow</b> depth and flow velocity are recorded and analyzed before and after locating energy dissipaters. For row arrangements, the increase in number of row and number of blocks can reduced the velocity of <b>flow</b> <b>water</b> more effectively and alternate arrangement of concrete blocks give the best result in reduction of flow velocity for various pattern of arrangements. In this study, the rectangular concrete block is proved to be more effective in reducing the flow velocity compared to the cylindrical concrete block with percentage of reduction of 73. 68 % for row arrangement and 75. 41 % for alternate pattern of arrangement...|$|R
