40|$|This paper {{describes}} a multi-media teaching package MULCOM, being developed within the EC <b>DG</b> <b>XVII</b> SAVE programme. The product, at present under development, {{is divided into}} two parts. The first part deals with the field study and laboratory approach to thermal comfort with further sections on visual and acoustic comfort. The second part deals with the practical issues of building design and components to minimise energy consumption in the realisation of these comfort conditions and consequent operational standards in buildings. The paper presents the case for the package, the computer methodology and the pedagogical approach used. Examples are given {{of the way in which}} it is intended that the package will be constructed and use...|$|E
40|$|ENeRG, the European Network for Research in Geo-Energy, which groups various European {{research}} organizations {{involved in}} the development of energy resources contained in the earth's crust, has sponsored a study on The Outlookfor Oil and Gas Production in the North Sea, on behalf of the Commission of European Communities (<b>DG</b> <b>XVII).</b> The Institut français du pétrole (IFP) was the main participant in the group, which included the Centre for Marine and Petroleum Technology (CMPT, formerly PSTI, United Kingdom), Rogaland Research (RF, Norway), the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS in association with the Danish Energy Agency, DEA, Denmark) and Eniricerche SpA (Italy). The main objectives of this analysis are as follows:- Identify the need for new technologies or technological improvements in order to increase the production of oil and gas in the North Sea. - Forecast recovery levels that result from the implementation of these technologies. - Estimate the impact of these forecasts on the volume of activity and employment in the European oil and gas industry. L'ENeRG (European Network for Research in Geo-Energy), qui regroupe de nombreux organismes de recherche européens impliqués dans la valorisation des ressources énergétiques contenues dans l'écorce terrestre, a suscité une étude sur les Perspectives de production de pétrole et de gaz en mer du Nord, pour le compte de la Commission des Communautés européennes (<b>DG</b> <b>XVII).</b> L'Institut français du pétrole (IFP) en a été le principal acteur; les autres intervenants comprenaient : le Centre for Marine and Petroleum Technology (CMPT, ex-PSTI, Royaume-Uni), Rogaland Research (RF, Norvège), Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS, en association avec la Danish Energy Agency, DEA, Danemark) et Eniricerche SpA (Italie). Les principaux objectifs de cette analyse* sont les suivants - identifier les besoins en technologies nouvelles ou en améliorations technologiques permettant d'accroître la production d'hydrocarbures en mer du Nord; - prévoir les niveaux de récupération résultant de la mise en Suvre de ces développements; - estimer l'impact de ces prévisions sur le volume d'activîté et l'emploi dans le secteur de l'industrie pétrolière et gazière...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} few years the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems (FhG-ISE) in Freiburg has {{supplied}} a couple of remote houses with continuous 23 OV AC power. The experiences with these installations influenced the described photovoltaic demonstration project which has been supported by the Commission of the European Communities (<b>DG</b> <b>XVII).</b> A major improvement is the use of an advanced version of the FHG-ISE inverter, leading to a significantly simplified overall installation. In this presentation three examples with different requirements are shown: One is "Bognago", a little village in the Italian Alps. Another one is the "Rotwandhaus", a house of the Deutscher Alpenverein (German Alpine Association) where the combination of a wind generator with a photovoltaic installation is presented. The last project is the "House Langer" where a comparison between two different battery technologies is made. These investigations, supported by the BMFT, lead to conclusions on the suitability o f the two battery technologies used for supplying power to remote areas...|$|E
40|$|The EURIO - Keep in Touch project, {{which has}} been funded by the European Commission, <b>DG</b> <b>XVII</b> in the {{framework}} of the INCO-COPERNICUS programme, started on January 1, 1997 and ended on December 31, 1998. It was the first follow-up project to the pilot phase of EURIO (funded by DG XII within the JOULE programme from 1993 - 1995). The main intention of the EURIO projects is to support Research and Technological Development (RTD) strategies in the fields of energy planning and environmental protection. Within the pilot phase, the EURIO network grew to comprise about 25 institutes and organisations from Western and Eastern Europe as well as from Asia. Within this network, experiences, data, tools and methodologies have been exchanged. 13 of these partners (3 from EU member countries and 10 from Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs)) are directly involved in the EURIO - Keep in Touch project, but contacts are maintained to the other partners as well. The EURIKO - Keep in Touch project has shown that a network of researchers from Western as well as from Central and Eastern European Countries is especially useful in the field of energy and environment which is characterised by transboundary and global problems. A continuation of the network's activities is regarded as necessary by all partners. (orig.)
