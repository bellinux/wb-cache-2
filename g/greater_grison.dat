25|$|The Belize Zoo {{is home to}} {{a variety}} of mammals, {{including}} Belize's national animal, the Baird's tapir, and the five wildcat species found in Belize: (jaguar, puma, ocelot, margay, and jaguarundi). Other mammals include white-tailed deer, red brocket, spider monkey, howler monkey, <b>greater</b> <b>grison,</b> white-lipped peccary, collared peccary, and kinkajou.|$|E
50|$|The <b>greater</b> <b>grison</b> (Galictis vittata), is {{a species}} of {{mustelid}} native to South and Central America.|$|E
50|$|Several carnivorans have {{interdigital}} webbing, {{including the}} <b>greater</b> <b>grison</b> (Galictis vittata), the Colombian weasel (Mustela felipei), the Amazon weasel (Mustela africana), and the mink (Neovison vison).|$|E
50|$|Like {{many other}} mustelids, <b>greater</b> <b>grisons</b> possess anal scent glands that secrete a {{yellowish}} or greenish musk. Although not especially noxious {{in comparison with}} that of other species, this can be sprayed at attackers, {{as well as being}} used to mark the grison's territory.|$|R
50|$|<b>Greater</b> <b>grisons</b> are {{primarily}} terrestrial, although they can climb trees and swim well. They are mostly diurnal, and only occasionally active at night. They live {{alone or in}} pairs, with home ranges of at least 4.2 km2, and a very low population density, such that they are rarely encountered in the wild. They spend the night sleeping in cavities in hollow logs or beneath tree roots, or else in the abandoned burrows of other animals.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Greater</b> <b>grisons</b> {{are native}} to Central and South America, ranging from {{southern}} Mexico in the north, to central Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia in the south. They inhabit {{a wide range}} of forest and cerrado habitats, and are usually seen near rivers and streams. They are typically found at elevations below 500 m, but they may be found as high as 2000 m {{in some parts of the}} Bolivian Andes. In some regions, they may also be found in cultivated areas, such as plantations and rice paddies. Four living, and one fossil subspecies are recognised: ...|$|R

50|$|Mammals {{found in}} the park include: the jaguar, the bicolored-spined porcupine, the puma, the tapeti, the giant otter, the red brocket, the tayra, the pacarana, the short-eared dog, the giant anteater, the green acouchi, the <b>greater</b> <b>grison,</b> the Amazon dwarf squirrel, the Amazon river dolphin, the emperor tamarin, the South American coati, the coppery titi, etc.|$|E
50|$|The <b>greater</b> <b>grison</b> is {{a slender}} animal with short legs, a long neck, and a short, bushy tail. They {{are similar in}} {{appearance}} to the closely related lesser grison, from which they can be most readily distinguished by their greater size, with a head-body length ranging from 45 to 60 cm. Adults weigh between 1.5 and 3.8 kg in the wild, but may become larger when reared in captivity.|$|E
25|$|The natural predators {{of adult}} greater rheas {{are limited to}} the cougar (Puma concolor), which are found in most areas {{inhabited}} by greater rheas and are certain to be their leading predator, and the jaguar (Panthera onca), which are found with greater rheas and opportunistically hunt them in the Paraguayan chaco, central Bolivia and the Brazilian cerrado. Feral dogs are known to kill younger birds, and the southern caracara (Caracara plancus) is suspected to prey on hatchlings. Armadillos sometimes feed on greater rhea eggs; nests have been found which had been undermined by a six-banded armadillo (Euphractus sexcinctus) or a big hairy armadillo (Chaetophractus villosus) and the rhea eggs were broken apart. Predation on young rheas has also been reportedly committed by <b>greater</b> <b>grisons</b> (Galictis vittata).|$|R
50|$|Grisons {{measure up}} to 60 cm in length, and weigh between 1 to 3 kg. The lesser grison is {{slightly}} smaller than the <b>greater</b> <b>grison.</b> Grisons generally resemble a skunk, but with a smaller tail, shorter legs, wider neck, and more robust body. The pelage along the back is a frosted gray with black legs, throat, face, and belly. A sharp white stripe extends from the forehead {{to the back of}} the neck.|$|E
50|$|Lesser grisons {{have a long}}, slender body, short legs, and a bushy tail. They have a {{long neck}} and a small head with a {{flattened}} forehead and rounded ears. They are smaller than the closely related <b>greater</b> <b>grison,</b> with a head-body length of 27 to 52 cm and a tail 14 to 19 cm long. Adults weigh anything from 1.2 to 2.4 kg. Females are slighter smaller and more slender than males.|$|E
5000|$|A grison, {{also known}} as a South American wolverine, is any {{mustelid}} in the genus Galictis. Native to Central and South America, the genus contains two extant species: the <b>greater</b> <b>grison</b> (Galictis vittata), which is found widely in South America, through Central America to southern Mexico; and the lesser grison (Galictis cuja), which is restricted to the southern half of South America. In Spanish it is referred to as a huroncito (literally [...] "little ferret") or grisón and in Portuguese as a furão.|$|E
50|$|Carnivorans (order Carnivora) {{are native}} only to islands {{at the margins}} of the Caribbean. On Trinidad, the tayra (Eira barbara), the Neotropical otter (Lontra longicaudis), the ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), and the crab-eating raccoon (Procyon cancrivorus) have been recorded. Three carnivorans are known from the island of Cozumel off eastern Mexico, all of which are {{diminutive}} in size relative to their mainland relatives. The Cozumel coati, sometimes recognized as a separate species, Nasua nelsoni, belongs to the same species as the mainland white-nosed coati (Nasua narica), but the raccoon is still classified as a distinct species, the Cozumel raccoon (Procyon pygmaeus). The Cozumel fox, related to the mainland gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), has yet to receive a scientific name. The kinkajou (Potos flavus) has been recorded a few times, but may not be native to the island. The <b>greater</b> <b>grison</b> (Galictis vittata) has also been recorded, but apparently in error.|$|E
40|$|This study reports ticks {{collected}} from wild carnivores from different habitat types in Panama. We examined 94 individual wild carnivores {{and we found}} 87 parasitized by ticks: seven coyotes, six crab-eating foxes, 54 coatis, four raccoons, five ocelots, two pumas, two gray foxes, two skunks, and one each of kinkajou, jaguar, jaguaroundi, <b>greater</b> <b>grison</b> and tayra. We identified 13 species of tick: Ornithodoros puertoricensis, Amblyomma auricularium, A. dissimile, A. mixtum, A. oblongoguttatum, A. ovale, A. parvum, A. pecarium, A. tapirellum, A. varium, Haemaphysalis juxtakochi, Ixodes affinis, Rhipicephalus sanguineus s. l. and immatures of Ixodes and Amblyomma. Amblyomma ovale and A. oblongoguttatum were the most common species, found on nine and six carnivore species respectively. This is the first report of A. oblongoguttatum on Puma yagouaroundi and Procyon lotor; of A. dissimile, A. pecarium, A. tapirellum and A. varium on Nasua narica; and A. auricularium on P. lotor. Our data do not enable us to establish incidence of tick parasitism, but add valuable information to the current knowledge of the tick species that infest wild carnivores in Panama.
