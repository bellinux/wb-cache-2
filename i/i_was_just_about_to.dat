60|$|BROADBENT. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> {{ring for}} tea when you came. Sit down, Mr Haffigan.|$|E
60|$|Rectus {{had gone}} on board, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> follow him, when our old Minorcan stepped up to me.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> {{shake hands}} with them all, {{previous}} to my final departure from their presence, when the Boots came into the room.|$|E
6000|$|Lize began, abruptly: [...] "I'm down, but not out; in fact, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{coming up}} to see you this afternoon. Lee and <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> pulling out for good." ...|$|R
2500|$|... which, {{unlike the}} tripos, {{is a test}} of {{original}} research. Robert Leslie Ellis, one of the examiners, {{is said to have}} declared to another examiner [...] "You and <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> fit to mend his pens." ...|$|R
6000|$|Lawford slowly {{shook his}} head. 'You know {{in your heart}} it isn't, Sheila; you {{understand}} me quite well, although you persistently pretend not to. I can't argue now. I can't speak up for myself. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> as far down as I can go. It's only Alice.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> give up {{the hunt}} for my ball in despair, when I heard Celia's voice calling {{to me from the}} edge of the undergrowth. There was a sharp note in it which startled me.|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{door closed}} softly below, and a step came {{creeping}} towards the back-stairs. Sure now of my prey, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> scream 'Jack!' when something went splash {{into the tub}} {{at the foot of}} the back-stairs.|$|E
6000|$|This plan delighted Miss Ruth, but I saw {{in it the}} {{beginning}} of the workings of a deep-laid scheme. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> sit down when Mrs. Aleshine said to me in a low voice, as she left us: ...|$|E
5000|$|... "When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{playing in}} Warri, I {{started as a}} defender. The coach whom I played under said <b>I</b> <b>was</b> fast and tall, and because of these qualities he saw in me, he {{converted}} me to a striker... I started playing in England when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> seven years old; and as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> growing up, <b>I</b> started from the lower divisions." [...] Sodje explains his early career.|$|R
60|$|We {{had been}} settled some months {{in our new}} home, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> half way through my sixth year, when one morning at breakfast we {{children}} were informed to our utter dismay that we {{could no longer be}} permitted to run absolutely wild; that a schoolmaster had been engaged who would live in the house and would have us in the schoolroom during the morning and part of the afternoon.|$|R
6000|$|... "I trailed {{around to}} the rocks where we had the tumble last winter, and then I came up as silently as a Comanche after a scalp. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> ready to fire when the deer took alarm, but I caught him when he raised his head, and all he gave was one leap {{and it was all}} over. Where <b>is</b> father? <b>I</b> must tell him." [...] And Ralph looked around impatiently.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> yell {{a signal}} cry when I saw Don, with hair rising stiff, run forward. He took a dozen jumps, then yelping broke down the steep, yellow and green gorge. He {{disappeared}} before I {{knew what had}} happened.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Turn it to any purpose? You can, Miss Willoughby, and I {{shall have}} the honour {{to lay the}} method before you, of course only for your consideration, and under seal of secrecy. Indeed <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> write to you asking for an interview.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Edward {{shook his}} head. [...] "I was merely envying Miss Drewitt her {{possession}} of you," [...] he said, carelessly, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> remark that I wished {{you were my}} uncle too, when she came indoors. I suppose she wanted you to hear it." ...|$|E
5000|$|William's {{father was}} able to make a generous {{provision}} for his favourite son's education and, in 1841, installed him, with extensive letters of introduction and ample accommodation, at Peterhouse, Cambridge. In 1845 Thomson graduated as Second Wrangler. He also won the First Smith's Prize,which, unlike the tripos, is a test of original research. Robert Leslie Ellis, one of the examiners, is said to have declared to another examiner [...] "You and <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> fit to mend his pens." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Red Cloud, dear Red Cloud," [...] she said, [...] "your {{reasoning}} <b>is</b> all wrong. <b>I</b> think I {{love you}} best. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> making up my mind, and it's for you. And now, just {{to help me}} to be sure, {{tell me what you}} told me a little while ago--you know--' I love the woman, the one woman. After a dozen years of possession I love her quite madly, oh, so sweetly madly.' Say it to me, Red Cloud." ...|$|R
5000|$|O'Malley {{stated that}} he wanted to create a [...] "hybrid" [...] work that {{received}} inspiration from American and Japanese comics, and that he [...] "wanted to reach towards the japanese comics from my own starting point." [...] When asked if he considers Scott Pilgrim to be a manga, O'Malley responded by saying [...] "Um… No, <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> thinking <b>about</b> that today. <b>I</b> guess <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> thinking <b>about</b> the whole OEL thing. I think it’s influenced… I like the term 'manga-influenced comics,' but I only like it because no one else likes it." ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{sprang to}} his feet. [...] "Why, certainly, Miss Armytage." [...] For so imperturbable {{a young man}} he seemed oddly breathless in his eagerness to welcome her. [...] "Are you looking for O'Moy? He left me nearly half-an-hour ago to go to breakfast, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> follow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The devil you do, Woods!" [...] {{cried the}} captain, {{looking up from}} his bit of dry toast, in astonishment. [...] "Why, my dear fellow--this is odd-- {{excessively}} odd, if the truth must be said.--To own the real state of the case, chaplain, you have won me over, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> make proper acknowledgments of your victory!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> clamber {{along the}} jagged rocks which {{lie at the}} base of the cliff next to the sea, in search of some {{foothold}} to the top, when I chanced to see a canoe rounding the end of the island. I threw my-self down behind a large boulder where I could watch the dugout and its occupants without myself being seen.|$|E
5000|$|... "I have <b>just</b> {{tried to}} <b>be</b> natural {{in my own}} way and would love to play such characters. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>just</b> passionate <b>about</b> acting in films." [...] — Jadhav {{speaking}} about her role in Dhag.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{but look}} here, Bone; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> {{thinking}} <b>about</b> it, that's all. You're always drumming it into me about not taking anything for granted. Anyway, {{by the time}} I go to Plato I'll know----" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Joyce {{stopped him}} as he was going up-stairs to his room. [...] "Victor, don't worry about me. While it looks as though I have lost a good deal of money through Pettus, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> by no means bankrupt. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> when <b>I</b> met your mother. She has not enriched me--I mean The Voices have not--neither have they impoverished me. It's just the same with Leo. She's almost exactly where she was when she came East. It would seem {{as if they had been}} playing with us just to show us how unsubstantial earthly {{possessions}} are." ...|$|R
60|$|He almost chirped the {{delightful}} {{words in}} a high, pleasant voice, but except {{for the first three}} of them, they were too many for my small Latin, and I afterwards forgot to test the aptness of his quotation. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> ask him (with some little unwillingness) to translate the whole ode for me, when I heard Fanny's step at the door. I desisted.|$|E
60|$|When we {{got down}} into the area I felt indescribably foolish literally, as the saying is, in a hole. There {{was nothing but a}} closed door, {{shuttered}} windows, the steps down which we had come, the ridiculous well in which I found myself, and the ridiculous man who had brought me there, and who stood there with dancing eyes. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> turn back when Rupert caught me by the elbow.|$|E
60|$|The heavenly {{gentleness}} of {{his smile}} made his apologies irresistible. The richness of his deep voice added its own indescribable charm to the interesting business question {{which he had}} just addressed to me. In truth, we were almost TOO nicely off for Trousers; we were quite overwhelmed by them. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> say so, {{when the door opened}} again, and an element of worldly disturbance entered the room, in the person of Miss Verinder.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{had a close}} shave {{the other}} night," [...] one of the boatmen remarked to Frank, as {{a few days after}} the {{adventure}} he strolled down with Ruthven and Handcock to talk to the boatman whose boat had been lost, [...] "a very narrow shave. I had one out there myself when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> your age, nigh forty years ago. I went out for a sail with my father in his fishing boat, and I didn't come back for three years. That was the only long voyage I ever went. I've been sticking to fishing ever since." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This werry minit," [...] {{answered}} the sailor. [...] "In fact <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> castin' <b>about</b> {{in my mind}} w'en you came up how I could best throw Ally Babby off the scent as to w'ere <b>I</b> <b>was</b> goin'." ...|$|R
6000|$|The landlord, who {{had shared}} the general {{suspicion}} abroad in the community, stared. [...] "Are you sure of that? <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> wondering <b>about</b> these folks. They have {{the reputation of}} being as poor as Job's off ox." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was {{surprised}}, I repeat, then, at the remark. But I {{was still}} more surprised when, looking round me in bewilderment, my hat and umbrella in hand, I saw the lean lady with the woollen shawl leaning upright {{against the door}} out of which <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> make my exit. She was still knitting, and I supposed that this erect posture against the door was only an eccentricity of spinsterhood and an oblivion of my intended departure.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{saw your}} plane fall," [...] replied Tarzan. [...] "I was {{watching}} {{you from a}} tree beside the clearing where you took off. I didn't have much to locate you by other than the general direction, {{but it seems that}} you volplaned a considerable distance toward the south after you disappeared from my view behind the hills. I have been looking for you further toward the north. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> turn back when I heard your pistol shot. Is your ship beyond repair?" ...|$|E
6000|$|One of {{the letters}} was {{directed}} to Samuel F. Billington, No. 7, The Crescent, Whitby, another to Herr Leutner, Varna. The third was to Coutts & Co., London, and the fourth to Herren Klopstock & Billreuth, bankers, Buda Pesth. The second and fourth were unsealed. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> look at them when I saw the door handle move. I sank back in my seat, having just had time to resume my book before the Count, holding still another letter in his hand, entered the room. He took up the letters {{on the table and}} stamped them carefully, and then turning to me, said, ...|$|E
25|$|I {{can tell}} how old <b>I</b> <b>was</b> because {{of where we}} lived - you know we moved all the time - and when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> two years old, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{walking down the street}} and having {{a hell of a lot}} of trouble because my {{shoelaces}} were untied and had come out of the holes, and every time I'd take a step I would step on one of those strings and stumble. And, you know, it was a major problem. A flat tire's nothing compared to that. And everybody who would pass would laugh and think it was so funny you know, me stumbling along.|$|R
60|$|The {{situation}} {{really would}} have been favorable had we {{not been in the}} path of the storm. True, the wind itself tore our canvas out of the gaskets, jerked out our topmasts, and made a raffle of our running-gear, but still we would have come through nicely had we not been square in front of the advancing storm-centre. That was what fixed us. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in a state of stunned, numbed, paralyzed collapse from enduring the impact of the wind, and <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> ready to give up and die when the centre smote us. The blow we received was an absolute lull. There was not a breath of air. The effect on one was sickening.|$|R
60|$|It was {{certainly}} significant that this vague childish recollection of something {{which might have}} happened when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>about</b> two years old should be {{the very first thing}} to recur to my my memory. Yet so appalled and alarmed <b>was</b> <b>I</b> by the weirdness of this sudden apparition, looming up, as it were, all by itself in the depths of my consciousness, that I hardly dared bring myself to think of trying to recall any other scenes of that dead and past existence. The picture rose like an exhalation, hanging unrelated in mid-air, a mere mental mirage: and it terrified me so much, that I shrank unutterably from the effort of calling up another of like sort to follow it.|$|R
