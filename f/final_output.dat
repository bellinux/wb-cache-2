5|$|The National Hurricane Center {{forecasts}} {{storm surge}} using the SLOSH model, {{which is an}} abbreviation for Sea, Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes. The model is accurate to within 20percent. SLOSH inputs include the central pressure of a tropical cyclone, storm size, the cyclone's forward motion, its track, and maximum sustained winds. Local topography, bay and river orientation, depth of the sea bottom, astronomical tides, {{as well as other}} physical features, are taken into account in a predefined grid referred to as a SLOSH basin. Overlapping SLOSH basins are defined for the southern and eastern coastline of the continental U.S. Some storm simulations use more than one SLOSH basin; for instance, Hurricane Katrina SLOSH model runs used both the Lake Ponchartrain / New Orleans basin, and the Mississippi Sound basin, for the northern Gulf of Mexico landfall. The <b>final</b> <b>output</b> from the model run will display the maximum envelope of water, or MEOW, that occurred at each location.|$|E

30|$|Generally, an {{outsourcing}} protocol {{is correct}} if the <b>final</b> <b>outputs</b> for client are valid. An outsourcing protocol is private {{if it is}} done without revealing to the external server either the actual data or the actual answer to the computation. An outsourcing protocol is verifiable if the <b>final</b> <b>outputs</b> received from cloud server can be verified by client. An outsourcing protocol is efficient if the computational work invested by client is substantially smaller than running the computation by itself, otherwise, the client could carry out the computation itself without putting confidentiality and integrity of its data at risk.|$|R
25|$|Amplifiers {{often have}} {{multiple}} stages in cascade to increase gain. Each stage of these designs {{may be a}} different type of amp to suit the needs of that stage. For instance, the first stage might be a class-A stage, feeding a class-AB push–pull second stage, which then drives a class-G <b>final</b> <b>output</b> stage, taking advantage of the strengths of each type, while minimizing their weaknesses.|$|E
25|$|A {{vertical}} input {{goes to a}} frequency-compensated step attenuator {{to reduce}} large signals to prevent overload. The attenuator feeds a low-level stage (or a few), which in turn feed gain stages (and a delay-line driver {{if there is a}} delay). Following are more gain stages, up to the <b>final</b> <b>output</b> stage which develops a large signal swing (tens of volts, sometimes over 100 volts) for CRT electrostatic deflection.|$|E
25|$|Although sensory {{pathways}} {{are often}} depicted as chains of individual neurons connected in series, {{this is an}} oversimplification. Sensory information is processed and modified at each level in the chain by interneurons and input from {{other areas of the}} nervous system. For example, cells in the main trigeminal nucleus (Main V in the diagram below) receive input from the reticular formation and cerebral cortex. This information contributes to the <b>final</b> <b>output</b> of the cells in Main V to the thalamus.|$|E

50|$|CIMA (Chartered Institute of Management Accountants) defines ABC as an {{approach}} to the costing and monitoring of activities which involves tracing resource consumption and costing <b>final</b> <b>outputs.</b> Resources are assigned to activities, and activities to cost objects based on consumption estimates. The latter utilize cost drivers to attach activity costs to outputs.|$|R
25|$|There are {{primarily}} two ways that networks can evolve, {{both of which}} can occur simultaneously. The first is that network topology can be changed by the addition or subtraction of nodes (genes) or parts of the network (modules) may be expressed in different contexts. The Drosophila Hippo signaling pathway provides a good example. The Hippo signaling pathway controls both mitotic growth and post-mitotic cellular differentiation. Recently {{it was found that}} the network the Hippo signaling pathway operates in differs between these two functions which in turn changes the behavior of the Hippo signaling pathway. This suggests that the Hippo signaling pathway operates as a conserved regulatory module that can be used for multiple functions depending on context. Thus, changing network topology can allow a conserved module to serve multiple functions and alter the <b>final</b> <b>output</b> of the network. The second way networks can evolve is by changing the strength of interactions between nodes, such as how strongly a transcription factor may bind to a cis-regulatory element. Such variation in strength of network edges has been shown to underlie between species variation in vulva cell fate patterning of Caenorhabditis worms.|$|E

Cinquemani found inspirations from the 1952 musical film Million Dollar Mermaid, in the scenes involving synchronized swimming. Contactmusic.com's Elinor Cosgrave highlighted the video's [...] "mix of symbolism", though criticized the references to Christ and rebirth.|$|E
500|$|The {{broadcast}} media industry is {{at a critical}} turning point in its development, with many countries moving from analog to digital broadcasts. This move is {{made possible by the}} production of cheaper, faster and more capable integrated circuits. The chief advantage of digital broadcasts is that they prevent a number of complaints common to traditional analog broadcasts. For television, this includes the elimination of problems such as snowy pictures, ghosting and other distortion. These occur {{because of the nature of}} analog transmission, which means that perturbations due to noise will be evident in the <b>final</b> <b>output.</b> Digital transmission overcomes this problem because digital signals are reduced to discrete values upon reception and hence small perturbations do not affect the <b>final</b> <b>output.</b> In a simplified example, if a binary message 1011 was transmitted with signal amplitudes [...] and received with signal amplitudes [...] it would still decode to the binary message 1011 — a perfect reproduction of what was sent. From this example, a problem with digital transmissions can also be seen in that if the noise is great enough it can significantly alter the decoded message. Using forward error correction a receiver can correct a handful of bit errors in the resulting message but too much noise will lead to incomprehensible output and hence a breakdown of the transmission.|$|E

500|$|Another design approach, {{particularly}} {{suitable for}} CAD {{because it is}} a numerical method, is to decompose the filter into a number of finite elements. [...] These elements are a large number of simple steps and ridges. [...] A number of methods are available to analyse the individual elements. [...] The mode matching technique expands the field equations of the element into a series of eigenfunctions and then for each mode matches the field at the interface between elements. [...] The Galerkin method expands the field equations into polynomial functions such as Gegenbauer polynomials or Chebyshev polynomials. [...] These methods can be mixed according to what is convenient for a particular type of element. [...] Whichever analysis method is used, the <b>final</b> <b>output</b> needed is the scattering parameters matrix for each element. [...] The overall filter response is then found from the combined scattering matrix of all the individual element matrices. [...] This method is analytic rather than synthetic, that is, a trial design must first exist in order to be analysed unlike synthesis methods where the starting point is a prescribed transfer function from which a design is synthesised.Manuilov and Kobrin, 2005, pp.93–94Manuilov et al., 2009, pp.527–528 ...|$|E
500|$|Blu-ray permits {{secondary}} audio decoding, {{whereby the}} disc content {{can tell the}} player to mix multiple audio sources together before <b>final</b> <b>output.</b> Some Blu-ray and HD DVD players can decode all of the audio codecs internally and can output LPCM audio over HDMI. Multichannel LPCM can be transported over an HDMI connection, {{and as long as}} the AV receiver implements multichannel LPCM audio over HDMI and implements HDCP, the audio reproduction is equal in resolution to HDMI 1.3 bitstream output. Some low-cost AV receivers, such as the Onkyo TX-SR506, do not allow audio processing over HDMI and are labelled as [...] "HDMI pass through" [...] devices. [...] Virtually all modern AV Receivers now offer HDMI 1.4 inputs and output(s) with processing for all of the audio formats offered by Blu-ray Discs and other HD video sources. [...] During 2014 several manufacturers introduced premium AV Receivers that include one, or multiple, HDMI 2.0 inputs along with a HDMI 2.0 output(s). However, it was not until 2015 that most major manufacturers of AV receivers also included support for HDCP 2.2 as will be needed to support certain high quality 4K/UHD video sources, such as the upcoming Blu-ray 4K/UHD players.|$|E
500|$|Thomas {{included}} Piz dancing humorously at {{the fraternity}} party because he [...] "could watch {{it over and}} over", and there were roughly fifteen minutes of footage of him dancing. The band that plays at the party, the Diamond Smugglers, is from Thomas's hometown of Austin, Texas, and they played at Thomas's wedding and 40th birthday party. The scene near the end with Logan smashing a police car to get intentionally thrown in prison confused the crew, who doubted its artistic and technical plausibility. However, Thomas {{was pleased with the}} <b>final</b> <b>output,</b> and producer Dan Etheridge called it [...] "one of the most compact and interesting visual storytelling pieces in the episode." [...] The episode went over budget. In this episode, Mac wears a shirt that says [...] "Ask Me About My STD", something which several critics commended for its comedic value. Thomas {{came up with the idea}} for the shirt and hired one of the other guest actors in the scene for another episode, commenting [...] "It's funny, I actually made that up, and I now have one, too." [...] In addition, because Thomas was so pleased with the acting in the scene from the boy who hands Mac a whiskey, he hired the actor for a role in a subsequent episode as an important witness to Dean O'Dell's death.|$|E

500|$|In October 2008, Spears hired Wade Robson, who had {{previously}} worked as director for her Dream Within a Dream Tour, to direct the tour; he announced that rehearsals would start in January. His wife, Amanda Robson, was also hired as co-creative director. Andre Fuentes {{was chosen as the}} lead choreographer. However, on December 23, 2008, the Robsons and Fuentes were replaced due to unknown reasons by Jamie King, who previously collaborated with Spears in her Oops!... I Did It Again World Tour. He did the casting of the dancers and acrobats, and worked with Spears on the setlist and the choreography. King described the show saying it was [...] "sexy, fun, explosive, and full of surprises. While avoiding such traditional circus elements as live animals, we've created something innovative and exciting using contortionists, dancers, lighting, fire and other special effects". Simon Ellis was hired as the musical director. The production design was done by Road Rage, a formed alliance between Nick Whitehouse, Bryan Leitch, William Baker and Steve Dixon. Lightning design was done by Visual Light, conformed by Whitehouse and Leitch. The stage was designed by Road Rage and set in-the-round, with a big stage in the center painted to look like a target. There were also two satellite stages in the sides unified by small catwalks, to resemble an actual three-ring circus. The stage was built by Tait Towers and included nine lifts, which had a cost of $10million. It traveled in 3,000 rolling cases packed into 32 semis and a crew of 150 people was needed to set it up. There was a semi-transparent Element Labs Stealth cylinder screen above the stage, comprising 960 panels that Solotech built into custom frames. The backdrops were designed by Dirk Decooedt. There were three new film sequences shot exclusively for the tour: an opening video featuring Perez Hilton, a video of Spears set to Marilyn Manson's [...] "Sweet Dreams Are Made of This" [...] and a final montage. The three videos were created by Veneno. Props, including swings, couches, unicycles, stripper poles, a gold cage and giant picture frames, were designed by ShowFX Inc.; they also provided custom VIP couch seating that lined the perimeter of the stage. VYV provided the video control, which included two Photon Show media servers and two Photon Controllers. The servers took timecode for the show and wrapped the images around the Stealth screen. Emric Epstein of VYV explained, [...] "The servers and software permits us to control a large number of video layers on the 360˚ LED screen, composite the layers in realtime, and transform the <b>final</b> <b>output</b> so that everything look seamless after going through the LED controllers. There is also an astounding 3D preview of the stage and video screens in the software so you can control or re-program the show without being inside the arena bowl".|$|E
2500|$|BBC Music {{reviewer}} Martin Aston {{has called}} Ghost on the Canvas [...] "a fine way to bow {{out of the}} business", citing Rick Rubin's production work with Johnny Cash through American Recordings.

Consequence of Sound's Nick Freed also compared this album to Cash's <b>final</b> <b>output,</b> noting that Ghost on the Canvas and Cash's American Recordings material shift from straight country music to different pop genres.

2500|$|Compressors are {{designed}} to help the audio engineer to manage the dynamic range (loudness) of an audio signal, or a group of audio signals. Prior to the invention of automatic compressors, audio engineers accomplished the same goal by [...] "riding the faders", which mean listening carefully to the mix and lowering the faders of any singer or instrument which was getting too loud. [...] A compressor accomplishes this by reducing the gain of a signal that is above a defined level (the threshold) by a defined amount (the ratio). [...] Without this gain reduction, a signal that gets, say 10% louder as an input, will be 10% louder at the output. [...] With the gain reduced, a signal that gets 10% louder at the input will be perhaps 3% louder at the output. Most compressors available {{are designed}} to allow the operator to select a ratio within a range typically between 1:1 and 20:1, with some allowing settings of up to ∞:1. [...] A compressor with an infinite ratio is typically referred to as a limiter. [...] The speed that the compressor adjusts the gain of the signal (called the attack) is typically adjustable as is the <b>final</b> <b>output</b> of the device.|$|E
