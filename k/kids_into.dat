25|$|In 2005, the {{government}} of Yucatán produced a handbook and DVD about the risks and implications of crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. The guide told immigrants where to find health care, how to get their <b>kids</b> <b>into</b> U.S. schools, and how to send money home. Officials in Yucatán said the guide is a necessity to save lives but some American groups accused {{the government}} of encouraging illegal immigration.|$|E
25|$|The Kids {{frequently}} {{appeared as}} themselves {{rather than as}} characters, and some sketches dealt directly {{with the fact that}} they were a comedy troupe producing a TV show. For example, Kevin McDonald announces that if the next sketch (which he has written) is not successful, the others are considering kicking him out of the group. In another episode, Thompson declares that he isn't gay anymore, which throws the other <b>Kids</b> <b>into</b> a panic, as they fear that the news will alienate the troupe's considerable gay fanbase. In yet another sketch (in which an employee, Foley, asks his boss, McDonald, for a raise) McDonald complains the setup is cliché and his character one-dimensional.|$|E
500|$|In a 20th-anniversary {{retrospective}} {{of the franchise}} in The Telegraph, David Horspool, the history editor of the Times Literary Supplement, defended the show's overall viewpoint, saying, [...] "There's no particular reason why grown-up historians shouldn't like Horrible Histories too... They simplify, {{and they have a}} definite point of view, but all historians are guilty of that to some degree." [...] He further said that [...] "Getting children interested in the past isn't necessarily easy, and Horrible Histories does it extremely effectively—and those who come to history because it's fun seem far more likely to stay with it in the long run." [...] Writing for entertainment website DorkAdore, Anna Lowman added that [...] "Terry Deary had the fine idea of getting <b>kids</b> <b>into</b> history by giving the facts a human face and a joke or two... The producers of the CBBC show have perfectly transferred Deary's ethos to television." ...|$|E

500|$|Most of the {{criticism}} of Harry Potter is from Fundamental Evangelical Christian groups, who believe the series' depiction of witchcraft is dangerous to children. Paul Hetrick, spokesman for Focus on the Family, an American Evangelical Christian group based in Colorado Springs, Colorado, outlined the reasons for his opposition to them: [...] " [...] some powerful and valuable lessons about love and courage and the ultimate victory of good over evil; however, the positive messages are packaged in a medium – witchcraft – that is directly denounced in Scripture." [...] Harry Potter {{has been the subject}} of at least six book burnings in the U.S. [...] In 2002, Chick Publications produced a comic book tract titled [...] "The Nervous Witch" [...] that declared [...] "the Potter books open a doorway that will put untold millions of <b>kids</b> <b>into</b> hell." [...] In 2007 Jacqui Komschlies wrote an article in Christianity Today comparing Harry Potter to [...] "rat poison mixed with orange soda," [...] and said, [...] "We're taking something deadly from our world and turning it into what some are calling 'merely a literary device.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} critics. Francis Rizzo III of DVD Talk called {{the scene where}} the office realizes Michael's loneliness [...] "absolutely one of the saddest moments I've seen in recent memory" [...] and noted that [...] "you can't help but feel for him". M. Giant of Television Without Pity gave the episode an [...] "A". Brendan Babish of DVD Verdict called the entry [...] "another great episode" [...] for the series and awarded it an [...] "A–". He noted that by bringing the supporting characters' <b>kids</b> <b>into</b> the office [...] "hilarity ensues". Babish applauded {{the lack of an}} arching plot, allowing [...] "Michael's faux pas" [...] to take center stage. Michael Sciannamea of AOLTV called [...] "Take Your Daughter to Work Day" [...] the [...] "best episode yet this season" [...] and noted that [...] "the writers will be hard-pressed {{to come up with a}} better story than this one." [...] Sciannamea called [...] "the transformation of Michael's indifference over the kids to one of acceptance and pure enjoyment of having them around" [...] as the [...] "most interesting aspect of the episode". He also called Dwight and Michael's sing-along near the end [...] "the single funniest moment of the season".|$|E
500|$|MCA {{gave the}} band its first {{professional}} recording budget, and Blink-182 {{began work on}} Enema of the State in October 1998. The trio {{had not been in}} a studio in two years and were anxious to record new material. Blink-182 returned to DML Studios to write new songs, where the band had previously spent time writing songs for their second record, Dude Ranch. The three spent much more time in the studio than on previous records, allowing them to try many different things. Barker would drive down each day from Riverside {{to take part in the}} writing process. Very satisfied with the results, the band completed writing in two weeks. Though Barker helped write the songs on Enema of the State, only Hoppus and DeLonge received songwriting credits, as Barker was technically a hired musician, not official band member. Don Lithgow, owner and operator of DML Studios, recalled that the trio's celebrity had increased considerably during the recording process: [...] " [...] was different than their other sessions— girls hanging around outside, calling their friends on cell phones. All the kids wanted autographs.... They'd unlock the doors and let <b>kids</b> <b>into</b> the studio, which most bands would never do." [...] Due to the success of Dude Ranch, the label and band management had high expectations.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Publishers Weekly, Applegate talked about the source of inspiration and realization for the Animorphs series: [...] "I grew up loving animals and lived with the usual suburban menagerie of dogs, cats and gerbils", she said. [...] "I really {{wanted to find a}} way to get <b>kids</b> <b>into</b> the heads of various species and decided that a science-fiction premise was the way to do this." [...] Applegate tried to accurately depict the various animals, and did research such as visiting [...] "a raptor center where they rehabilitate injured birds". [...] "When Tobias becomes a hawk, I want the reader to see the world as a hawk might see it—to soar on the warm breezes and hurtle toward the ground to make a kill," [...] she said.|$|E

2500|$|At {{least one}} {{psychologist}} warned that Survive This risked being exploitative and might damage {{the mental health}} of the participants. [...] "You're putting <b>kids</b> <b>into</b> real emotional situations for other people's enjoyment," [...] said Jennifer Kolari, a child and family therapist and author. [...] "It's okay to have some competition, it's okay to try out for things," [...] she says. [...] "Those are okay lessons for kids. But doing it on national television, to be watched and judged, that's where I feel it's a little bit exploitive, and I think we need to consider {{the mental health of}} the kids that are on that show." [...] But other mental health experts declared the show safe, concluding that the participants merely displayed strong competitiveness and that social ostracization was largely avoided.|$|E
2500|$|Lopez {{revealed}} to MTV that the album {{would have a}} very tight and focused concept. Although in initial interviews she refused to reveal the title or concept, she said the album was personal to her. [...] "You can't help but put not only your <b>kids</b> <b>into</b> it, but to put anything you are going through in your music", she said. [...] "he {{only thing you can}} really sing or write is stuff that you know. The more music you make and the more that you get into it and the more you write, the more you realize that's all you can write." [...] In October 2009, People magazine revealed that Lopez's album was going to be called Love?. She would tell KIIS FM's DJ Skee that she had chosen to call her album Love? because love was something that still confused her. [...] "Love is the most confusing thing in the world, that's why the album is called Love with a question mark." [...] Lopez told The Advocates Brandon Voss that she also took into account the gay community and how they might feel towards the album. She said all her previous albums had a universal appeal and the LGBT community had played a part in the success of her music in the past, e.g. [...] "Waiting for Tonight" [...] (1999).|$|E
2500|$|While on set filming for The Back-up Plan in June 2009, Lopez {{revealed}} to MTV's Larry Carol {{that she had}} been working on the follow-up album to 2007's Brave. She had been working on the album during pregnancy, {{but it was not until}} the birth of her twins, Max and Emme, that she was able to focus on the project. Carol asked about the direction of the album, but Lopez refused to comment, instead saying [...] "You can't help but put not only your <b>kids</b> <b>into</b> it, but to put anything you are going through in your music. [...] The only thing you can really sing or write is stuff that you know. The more music you make and the more that you get into it and the more you write, the more you realize that's all you can write." [...] At the time of the interview, two of the album's songs had leaked. The first, titled [...] "(What Is) Love?", was written by Wynter Gordon and co-written and produced by Emile Dernst II (D'Mile). After expressing dismay at the song's leak, its writer (Wynter Gordon) spoke of why the song was very personal to her: [...] " [...] not knowing what love is ...I felt like so many woman have that same story. No fathers, families, abusive boyfriends and husbands..no parental support, they feel alone [...]. I've had my few relationships and have yet to feel love [...]" [...] Jean Baptist produced a 'part-two' for the song, which was mentioned at one of the album pre-release parties, attended by Rap-Up magazine, however the second part of the song was omitted from the track listing. The original version of the song, under the title [...] "What Is Love", was included on the soundtrack to the 2010 film, The Back-up Plan, starring Lopez.|$|E

6000|$|The puzzling {{nature of}} the mansion, {{resulting}} from the chimney, is peculiarly noticeable in the dining-room, which has no less than nine doors, opening in all directions, and into all sorts of places. A stranger {{for the first time}} entering this dining-room, and naturally taking no special heed at which door he entered, will, upon rising to depart, commit the strangest blunders. Such, for instance, as opening the first door that comes handy, and finding himself stealing up-stairs by the back passage. Shutting that, he will proceed to another, and be aghast at the cellar yawning at his feet. Trying a third, he surprises the housemaid at her work. In the end, no more relying on his own unaided efforts, he procures a trusty guide in some passing person, and in good time successfully emerges. Perhaps as curious a blunder as any, was that of a certain stylish young gentleman, a great exquisite, in whose judicious eyes my daughter Anna had found especial favor. He called upon the young lady one evening, and found her alone in the dining-room at her needlework. He stayed rather late; and after abundance of superfine discourse, all the while retaining his hat and cane, made his profuse adieus, and with repeated graceful bows proceeded to depart, after fashion of courtiers from the Queen, and by so doing, opening a door at random, with one hand placed behind, very effectually succeeded in backing himself into a dark pantry, where he carefully shut himself up, wondering there was no light in the entry. After several strange noises as of a cat among the crockery, he reappeared through the same door, looking uncommonly crestfallen, and, with a deeply embarrassed air, requested my daughter to designate at which of the nine he should find exit. When the mischievous Anna told me the story, she said it was surprising how unaffected and matter-of-fact the young gentleman's manner was after his reappearance. He was more candid than ever, to be sure; having inadvertently thrust his white <b>kids</b> <b>into</b> an open drawer of Havana sugar, under the impression, probably, that being what they call [...] "a sweet fellow," [...] his route might possibly lie in that direction.|$|E
