However, as the population reaches its maximum (the carrying capacity), intraspecific competition becomes fiercer and the per capita growth rate slows until the population reaches a stable size.

50|$|Speciation theory {{caused by}} {{mountain}} ranges and Pleistocene glacial cycles: It {{is believed that}} many of the Iberolacerta genus had led to many speciation seen today because of the Pleistocene glacial cycles and Holocene habitat fragmentation. For example, I. monticola has been studied to determine its cause of speciation. There was an analysis of 17 I. monticola population's mitochondrial DNA sequences, at a control region and cytochrome b loci, throughout the northwestern quadrant of the Iberian Peninsula. The results these researchers data gathered lead to the conclusion that correlated to a “refugia within refugia” model since the comparative phylogeographic analyses had shown consistent genetic subdivisions patterns. This suggested that the mountain ranges could potentially be the cause of the descending species of Iberolacerta. It was also hypothesized that the Holocene epoch then represented a long-term survival <b>inflexion</b> <b>point</b> for the derived species not to survive the preceding glacial cycle.|$|E

40|$|During {{the past}} two decades AlGan/GaN Heterostructure Field Effect Transistors (HFETs) have been the target of much {{attention}} in high power microwave applications. Crystal imperfections in AlGan/GaN HFETs have been pointed out as the cause of many reliability concerns such as drain-current collapse, gate lag, and excessive gate leakage-current. Current collapse and reliability degradation due to electron trapping at the surface layer of AlGan/GaN HFETs are major impediments for commercialization of these devices. Even though there have been remarkable improvements in crystal growth and device fabrication technology, trapping effects in AlGan/GaN HFETs, specially under high drain-voltage conditions, have not been completely removed. Therefore, an assured simulation of HFET with incorporation of trapping effects is needed. In this thesis, in order to substantiate the hypothesis of electron trapping at deep surface states as the cause of semi-permanent current collapse this phenomenon is studied with the use of CADtool Medici. Monte Carlo simulation of electronic transport at AlGan/GaN channels reveals that in addition to the steady-state velocity overshoot there exists a pronounced kink in the low electric-field region of the drift-velocity versus electric-field characteristics of these channels. Existence of the <b>inflexion</b> <b>points</b> attributed to this kink and the large width of the overshoot pattern in conjunction with the large electric-fields conventionally applied to these wide band-gap semiconductors, make the modeling of electronic devices fabricated in this technology different than those of other 111 -V semiconductors. An analytical model for drain current/voltage characteristic of AlGan/GaN HFETs with incorporation of steady-state drift-velocity overshoot and the <b>inflexion</b> <b>points</b> in the electronic drift transport characteristics is also presented in this thesis. The wide peak and pronounced <b>inflexion</b> <b>points</b> in the transport characteristics of AlGan/GaN heterojunctions are modeled through considering a drift-diffusion channel rather than a drift-only transport channel. Simulation results have been compared to a non-diffusion type channel implemented with the assumption of Ridley's saturating transport model. The model is based on applying an iterative approach between Poisson's equation and current-continuity equation, which relieves the results from the burden of the choice of fitting parameters. With the advancement of this technology, development of a versatile analytical model with incorporation of these considerations is vital for understanding the full range of capabilities of III-Nitride material system...|$|R

P. manselii have rectangular-shaped denticles in lingual view. Its tooth enamel ornamentation is largely inconspicuous, but there are apicobasally aligned ridges of low-relief. The mesial margin of some of its teeth have a pronounced distal curvature. Additionally, its palatines are strongly convex with a pronounced ridge along the midline. In palatal view, the palatine width narrows anteriorly from the suborbital fenestrae to the midline, in a distinct elongate triangular shape. The maxillopalatine suture midline terminus is level to the fourth maxillary alveolus. Finally, its quadrate distal articular surface is not separated into two condyles by a sulcus, and has only a very shallow depression at the centre. Like other geosaurins, P. manselii have large robust teeth, with moderate to strong mediolateral compression. Other notable characters of P. manselii are the presence of a separation between premaxilla and nasal approximately subequal to the midline length of the premaxilla, carinae formed by a keel and true microscopic denticles, and a long mandibular symphysis to which 9 out of 13 dentary teeth are adjacent.
