The dummy is then placed inside the test vehicle, set to seating position and then marked on either the head and knees. Up to fifty-eight data channels located in all parts of the Hybrid III, from the head to the ankle, record between 30000 and 35000 data items in a typical 100–150millisecond crash. Recorded in a temporary <b>data</b> <b>repository</b> in the dummy's chest, these data are downloaded to computer once the test is complete.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays {{there is}} an {{explosion}} of <b>data</b> <b>repositories</b> available in the Global Information System. In this context, users meet with the problems related to the heterogeneity and distribution of the <b>data</b> <b>repositories.</b> Access to the data may be facilitated by providing semantic views over the repositories that hide all the technical and organizative details associated with them. In this paper it is presented {{the definition of the}} mapping relation that permits one to relate data elements of the semantic views and those of the underlying <b>data</b> <b>repositories.</b> We define the syntax and the semantics of the mapping. From the syntactic point of view, mapping expressions are tuples which main components are relational algebra expressions. From the semantic point of view, the notions of well formed mapping relation and the extension defined by that mapping are introduced. Moreover, we demonstrate the completeness property of the mapping relation {{in the sense that it}} allows for answers to all queries formulated over the semantic view using the data stored in the <b>data</b> <b>repositories.</b> Copyright c fl 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd Key words: Terminological Systems, Mapping Information, Global Information Systems, <b>Data</b> <b>Repositories</b> 1...|$|R

The thesis proposes a flexible architecture that facilitates the automation of data integration from multiple heterogeneous biological <b>data</b> <b>repositories</b> using ontologies. The design uses ontologies to resolve the semantic conflicts that usually hinder schema integration and searching for information. The architecture implemented successfully demonstrates how ontologies facilitate the automation of data integration from multiple <b>data</b> <b>repositories.</b> Nevertheless, many optimizations to increase the performance of the system were realized during the implementation of various components in the architecture and are described in the thesis. by Howard H.
