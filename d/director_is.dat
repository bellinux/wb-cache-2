5|$|The film <b>director</b> <b>is</b> unknown, but it {{may have}} been Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson.

In late 1910, the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films. The list includes G.W. Abbe, Justus D. Barnes, Frank H.

5|$|The film <b>director</b> <b>is</b> unknown, but it {{may have}} been Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson. Sometimes the {{directional}} credit is given to Theodore Marston. The apparent origin of this error is from the American Film-Index 1908–1915. Film historian Q. David Bowers consulted one of the co-authors of the book, Gunnar Lundquist, and confirmed that the credit of Marston was in error. Theodore Marston worked with Pathé, Kinemacolor, Vitagraph and other companies, but there is no record of Marston working with Thanhouser. This error has persisted in several works including The Complete Index to Literary Sources in Film. The same work also credits Alphonse Ethier with a role, but this is not cited by Bowers.|$|E
5|$|The film <b>director</b> <b>is</b> unknown, but it {{may have}} been Barry O'Neil. Film {{historian}} Q.

The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. Cast credits are unknown, but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary. A surviving film still gives the possibility of identifying the three leading actors.|$|E

The first directors used an open sight rotating on an angular scale (e.g. degrees & minutes, grads or mils {{of one sort or}} another), but by World War I most <b>directors</b> <b>were</b> optical instruments. Introduction of digital artillery sights in the 1990s removed the need for directors.|$|R
