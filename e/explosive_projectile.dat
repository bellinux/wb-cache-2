500|$|As built, the Kongō {{class was}} {{fitted with a}} {{secondary}} armament of sixteen 50-caliber six-inch guns mounted in single casemates {{along the sides of}} the hull {{at the level of the}} upper deck. Eight guns were mounted per side, and each had an arc of fire of 130 degrees and a maximum elevation of +15 degrees. Each gun could fire a [...] high <b>explosive</b> <b>projectile</b> a maximum distance of [...] at a rate of between four and six shots per minute. During their reconstruction in the 1930s, the maximum elevation of the guns was increased to +30 degrees, which increased their maximum range by approximately [...] During their second reconstruction, two of these guns were removed from each ship, bringing the total to fourteen six-inch guns.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the unique}} {{features}} of the AMX-30 was the Obus à Charge Creuse de 105mm Modèle F1 (Obus G) HEAT projectile and its main gun, the Modèle F1, a monoblock steel [...] cannon. HEAT warheads suffer when spin stabilized, a product of rifled barrels, causing the French to develop the Obus G, (Gresse). This projectile was composed of two major parts, including the outer shell and a suspended inner shell, divided by ball bearings. This allowed the projectile to be spin-stabilized, and therefore more accurate than a normal fin-stabilized HEAT-round, while the inner shell did not move, allowing the warhead to work at maximum efficiency. The warhead, containing 780gram hexolite, could penetrate up to [...] of steel armour and was effective against tanks at up to [...] As it combined a good accuracy with a penetration that was independent of range, it has been considered an [...] "ideal round" [...] for its day The AMX-30 was also designed to fire the OCC F1 Mle.60 high <b>explosive</b> <b>projectile,</b> the SCC F1 training warhead and the OFUM PH-105 F1 smoke round. The main gun was coupled with a [...] recoil brake, which had a maximum extension of , and could depress to −8 degrees or elevate to 20 degrees. The turret's firepower was augmented by a coaxial [...] M2 Browning machine gun. The tank commander also made use of a [...] anti-aircraft machine gun on the turret roof. The vehicle carried 50 [...] projectiles, 748 [...] rounds and 2,050 [...] bullets. The tank commander was issued a cupola which offered ten all-around direct-vision episcopes, and a binocular telescope with 10x magnification. The commander was also given an optical full-field coincidence range finder. The gunner was given a telescoping gun sight and two observation periscopes.|$|E

50|$|Most fighter {{aircraft}} {{were too}} slow to catch a V-1 unless they had a height advantage. Even when intercepted, the V-1 was difficult to bring down.

50|$|Armour {{with two}} or more plates spaced a {{distance}} apart is called spaced armour.

50|$|During the First World War {{a number}} of novel crew-served {{launchers}} designed to increase the range of infantry hand grenades were developed, such as the Sauterelle crossbow and West Spring Gun and Leach Trench Catapult devices.

50|$|Owing to a {{wide variety}} of muzzle devices (including silencers, heat shields, and even rifle grenades), the weapon can be used to fire {{non-lethal}} and <b>explosive</b> <b>projectiles</b> by the means of blank cartridge, as well as normal ammunition. The BXP also features an underfolding buttstock, made from stamped steel. The standard sights are of open type, but the BXP can be equipped with laser aiming modules and collimating sights.|$|R

50|$|The 30F39 Krasnopol is a Russian 152/155 mm cannon-launched, fin-stabilized, base bleed-assisted, {{semi-automatic}} laser-guided, <b>explosive</b> <b>projectile.</b> It automatically 'homes' {{on a point}} {{illuminated by}} a laser designator, typically operated by a ground-based artillery observer. It is intended to engage small ground targets such as tanks, other direct fire weapons, strong-points, or other significant point targets visible to the observer. It can be used against both stationary and moving targets (providing these remain within the observer's field of view).|$|E
50|$|Dependent {{upon the}} type of projectile, {{ammunition}} for these guns is classified as high explosive, target practice, blank, or drill. The high <b>explosive</b> <b>projectile</b> contains a high explosive filler. The target practice projectile contains no explosive; it consists of either a solid projectile (designated shot) or a heavy-walled projectile with an empty base cavity. The blank ammunition has a black powder (low explosive) charge in the cartridge case and no projectile. The drill ammunition consists of completely inert cartridge which simulates the service ammunition.|$|E
50|$|The Countermine System (CMS), {{also known}} as Venom Darts, Venom Penetrators and GBU-61, is an anti-land-mine system {{consisting}} of chemical or <b>explosive</b> <b>projectiles</b> released from modified GPS-guided bombs.
