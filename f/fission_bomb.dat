5|$|July–September: Physicist Robert Oppenheimer convenes {{a summer}} {{conference at the}} University of California, Berkeley to discuss {{the design of a}} <b>fission</b> <b>bomb.</b> Edward Teller brings up the {{possibility}} of a hydrogen bomb as a major point of discussion.|$|E
5|$|From the first, {{research}} into the Super was directed by Teller, who was its most enthusiastic proponent. Although this work was always considered secondary to the objective of developing a <b>fission</b> <b>bomb,</b> the prospect of creating more powerful bombs was sufficient to keep it going. The Berkeley summer conference had convinced Teller that the Super was technologically feasible. An important contribution was made by Emil Konopinski, who suggested that deuterium could more easily be ignited if it was mixed with tritium. Bethe noted that a tritium-deuterium (T-D) reaction releases {{five times as much}} energy as a deuterium-deuterium (D-D) reaction. This was not immediately followed up, because tritium was hard to obtain, and there were hopes that deuterium could be easily ignited by a <b>fission</b> <b>bomb,</b> but the cross sections of T-D and D-D were measured by Manley's group in Chicago and Holloway's at Purdue.|$|E
5|$|Chemists at the Los Alamos Laboratory {{developed}} {{methods of}} purifying uranium and plutonium, the latter a metal that only existed in microscopic quantities when Project Y began. Its metallurgists found that plutonium had unexpected properties, but were nonetheless able to cast it into metal spheres. The laboratory built the Water Boiler, an aqueous homogeneous reactor, the third reactor {{in the world}} to become operational. It also researched the Super, a hydrogen bomb that would use a <b>fission</b> <b>bomb</b> to ignite a nuclear fusion reaction in deuterium and tritium.|$|E
50|$|Depleted uranium {{is used as}} a tamper in <b>fission</b> <b>bombs.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Vanunu gave {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} lithium-6 separation required {{for the production of}} tritium, an essential ingredient of fusion-boosted <b>fission</b> <b>bombs.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1952, the 10.4-megaton Ivy Mike {{explosion}} {{was announced}} {{as the first}} hydrogen bomb test, reinforcing the idea that hydrogen bombs are a thousand times more powerful than <b>fission</b> <b>bombs.</b>|$|R
5|$|To review {{this work}} and {{the general theory of}} fission reactions, Oppenheimer and Fermi convened {{meetings}} at the University of Chicago in June and at the University of California in Berkeley, in July with theoretical physicists Hans Bethe, John Van Vleck, Edward Teller, Emil Konopinski, Robert Serber, Stan Frankel, and Eldred C. Nelson, the latter three former students of Oppenheimer, and experimental physicists Emilio Segrè, Felix Bloch, Franco Rasetti, John Manley, and Edwin McMillan. They tentatively confirmed that a <b>fission</b> <b>bomb</b> was theoretically possible.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{detonation}} of {{the first}} Soviet <b>fission</b> <b>bomb</b> in August 1949, Fermi, along with Isidor Rabi, wrote a strongly worded report for the committee, opposing {{the development of a}} hydrogen bomb on moral and technical grounds. Nonetheless, Fermi continued to participate in work on the hydrogen bomb at Los Alamos as a consultant. Along with Stanislaw Ulam, he calculated that not only would the amount of tritium needed for Teller's model of a thermonuclear weapon be prohibitive, but a fusion reaction could still not be assured to propagate even with this large quantity of tritium. Fermi was among the scientists who testified on Oppenheimer's behalf at the Oppenheimer security hearing in 1954 that resulted in denial of Oppenheimer's security clearance.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Fermi {{served under}} J. Robert Oppenheimer on the General Advisory Committee, which advised the Atomic Energy Commission on nuclear matters and policy. Following the {{detonation}} {{of the first}} Soviet <b>fission</b> <b>bomb</b> in August 1949, he strongly opposed {{the development of a}} hydrogen bomb on both moral and technical grounds. He was among the scientists who testified on Oppenheimer's behalf at the 1954 hearing that resulted in the denial of the latter's security clearance. Fermi did important work in particle physics, especially related to pions and muons, and he speculated that cosmic rays arose through material being accelerated by magnetic fields in interstellar space. Many awards, concepts, and institutions are named after Fermi, including the Enrico Fermi Award, the Enrico Fermi Institute, the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, the Enrico Fermi Nuclear Generating Station, and the synthetic element fermium, making him one of 16 scientists who have elements named after them.|$|E
25|$|The {{hydrogen}} bomb age {{had a profound}} effect on the thoughts of nuclear war in the popular and military mind. With only <b>fission</b> <b>bombs,</b> nuclear war was something that possibly could be limited. Dropped by planes and only able to destroy the most built up areas of major cities, it was possible for many to look at <b>fission</b> <b>bombs</b> as a technological extension of large-scale conventional bombing—such as the extensive firebombing of German and Japanese cities during World War II. Proponents brushed aside as grave exaggeration claims that such weapons could lead to worldwide death or harm.|$|R
5000|$|Operation Shakti - (Pokhran-II) {{refers to}} the series of five nuclear bomb test explosions {{conducted}} by India at the Indian Army's Pokhran Test Range in May 1998. It was initiated with the detonation of one fusion and three <b>fission</b> <b>bombs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The German Empire was {{the first}} state {{suspected}} of having a program to develop <b>fission</b> <b>bombs.</b> Prominent scientists, such as Albert Einstein, disappeared from public view and papers on nuclear fission vanished after {{the equivalent of the}} Otto Hahn experiment on fission.|$|R
5|$|Compton asked {{theoretical}} physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer of the University of California, Berkeley, to {{take over}} research into fast neutron calculations—the key to calculations of critical mass and weapon detonation—from Gregory Breit, who had quit on 18 May 1942 because of concerns over lax operational security. John H. Manley, a physicist at the Metallurgical Laboratory, was assigned to assist Oppenheimer by contacting and coordinating experimental physics groups scattered across the country. Oppenheimer and Robert Serber of the University of Illinois examined the problems of neutron diffusion—how neutrons moved in a nuclear chain reaction—and hydrodynamics—how the explosion produced by a chain reaction might behave. To review this work and {{the general theory of}} fission reactions, Oppenheimer and Fermi convened meetings at the University of Chicago in June and at the University of California, Berkeley, in July 1942 with theoretical physicists Hans Bethe, John Van Vleck, Edward Teller, Emil Konopinski, Robert Serber, Stan Frankel, and Eldred C. Nelson, the latter three former students of Oppenheimer, and experimental physicists Emilio Segrè, Felix Bloch, Franco Rasetti, John Henry Manley, and Edwin McMillan. They tentatively confirmed that a <b>fission</b> <b>bomb</b> was theoretically possible.|$|E
5|$|For Green Granite, Penney {{proposed}} a design based on radiation implosion and staging. There would be three stages, {{which he called}} Tom, Dick and Harry. Tom, the primary stage, would be a <b>fission</b> <b>bomb.</b> It would produce radiation to implode a secondary, Dick, another fission service. In turn, it would implode Harry, a thermonuclear tertiary. Henceforth, the British designers would refer to Tom, Dick and Harry rather than primary, secondary and tertiary. They still had only vague ideas about how a thermonuclear weapon would work, and whether one, two, or three stages would be required. Nor was there much more certainty about the boosted designs, with no agreement on whether the boosting thermonuclear fuel was best placed inside the hollow core, as in Orange Herald, or wrapped around it, as in Green Bamboo. Keith Roberts and John Ward studied the detonation waves in a thermonuclear detonation, {{but there was an}} incomplete understanding of radiation implosion.|$|E
25|$|In the end, President Truman {{made the}} final decision, {{looking for a}} proper {{response}} to the first Soviet atomic bomb test in 1949. On January 31, 1950, Truman announced a crash program to develop the hydrogen (fusion) bomb. At this point, however, the exact mechanism was still not known: the classical hydrogen bomb, whereby {{the heat of the}} <b>fission</b> <b>bomb</b> would be used to ignite the fusion material, seemed highly unworkable. However, an insight by Los Alamos mathematician Stanislaw Ulam showed that the <b>fission</b> <b>bomb</b> and the fusion fuel could be in separate parts of the bomb, and that radiation of the <b>fission</b> <b>bomb</b> could first work in a way to compress the fusion material before igniting it.|$|E
50|$|Pokhran-II {{consisted}} of five detonations, {{of which the}} first was a fusion bomb and the remaining four were <b>fission</b> <b>bombs.</b> These nuclear tests resulted in a variety of sanctions against India by a number of major states, including Japan and the United States.|$|R
2500|$|Tritium is an {{important}} component in nuclear weapons. It is used to enhance the efficiency and yield of <b>fission</b> <b>bombs</b> and the <b>fission</b> stages of hydrogen bombs in a process known as [...] "boosting" [...] as well as in external neutron initiators for such weapons.|$|R
50|$|Fusion-boosted <b>fission</b> <b>bombs</b> {{can also}} be made immune to neutron {{radiation}} from nearby nuclear explosions, which can cause other designs to predetonate, blowing themselves apart without achieving a high yield.The combination of reduced weight in relation to yield and immunity to radiation has ensured that most modern nuclear weapons are fusion-boosted.|$|R
25|$|Finally, {{the heat}} for fusion {{ignition}} {{comes not from}} the primary but from a second <b>fission</b> <b>bomb</b> called the spark plug, embedded {{in the heart of}} the secondary. The implosion of the secondary implodes this spark plug, detonating it and igniting fusion in the material around it, but the spark plug then continues to fission in the neutron-rich environment until it is fully consumed, adding significantly to the yield.|$|E
25|$|In the 1940s, bomb {{designers}} at Los Alamos {{thought the}} secondary {{would be a}} canister of deuterium in liquefied or hydride form. The fusion reaction would be D-D, harder to achieve than D-T, but more affordable. A <b>fission</b> <b>bomb</b> at one end would shock-compress and heat the near end, and fusion would propagate through the canister to the far end. Mathematical simulations showed it would not work, even with large amounts of expensive tritium added.|$|E
25|$|The {{strategic}} importance {{of nuclear weapons}} is a major reason why the technology of nuclear fission is politically sensitive. Viable <b>fission</b> <b>bomb</b> designs are, arguably, within the capabilities of many, being relatively simple from an engineering viewpoint. However, the difficulty of obtaining fissile nuclear material to realize the designs {{is the key to}} the relative unavailability of nuclear weapons to all but modern industrialized governments with special programs to produce fissile materials (see uranium enrichment and nuclear fuel cycle.|$|E
5000|$|A major {{challenge}} in all nuclear weapon designs {{is to ensure}} that a significant fraction of the fuel is consumed before the weapon destroys itself. The amount of energy released by <b>fission</b> <b>bombs</b> can range from the equivalent of just under a ton to upwards of 500,000 tons (500 kilotons) of TNT (...) [...]|$|R
5000|$|Though {{dangerous}} and frequently lethal to humans within the immediate area, the critical mass formed {{would not be}} capable of producing a massive nuclear detonation of the type that <b>fission</b> <b>bombs</b> are designed to produce. This is because all the design features {{needed to make a}} nuclear warhead cannot arise by chance.|$|R
5000|$|... 1986- 100 to 200 <b>fission</b> <b>bombs</b> and {{a number}} of fusion bombs Vanunu leaks Dimona {{facility}} secrets, at US's level in fission and boosted weapons as of 1955 to 1960, would require supercomputers to improve their [...] "less complex" [...] hydrogen bombs without nuclear tests, had [...] "unequivocally" [...] tested a miniaturized nuclear device.|$|R
25|$|The {{idea of the}} {{hydrogen}} bomb first came to public attention in 1949, when prominent scientists openly recommended against building nuclear bombs {{more powerful than the}} standard pure-fission model, on both moral and practical grounds. Their assumption was that critical mass considerations would limit the potential size of fission explosions, but that a fusion explosion could be as large as its supply of fuel, which has no critical mass limit. In 1949, the Soviets exploded their first <b>fission</b> <b>bomb,</b> and in 1950 U.S. President Harry S. Truman ended the H-bomb debate by ordering the Los Alamos designers to build one.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, {{shortly after}} the Americans tested a {{thermonuclear}} weapon in 1952, followed by the Soviets with Joe 4, and before the UK government took a decision in July 1954 to develop a thermonuclear weapon, the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment at Aldermaston {{was asked about the}} possibilities for a very large pure <b>fission</b> <b>bomb</b> with a yield of one megaton. This study referred to the Zodiak Mk.3 bomb, but progressed no further than a rudimentary study. At this time studies were also started that ultimately led to a decision in 1954 to develop a thermonuclear weapon, and the design studies were split into two tracks because the British at that time had not yet discovered the Teller-Ulam technique necessary to initiate fusion. One track led to an intermediate design, the so-called Type A thermonuclear design, similar to the Alarm Clock and layer cake hybrid designs of other nuclear powers; although these designs are now regarded as large boosted fission weapons, and no longer regarded as thermonuclear weapons that derive a very large part of their energy from a fusion reaction, designated by the British as Type B, but as hybrids. The British hybrid weapon was known as Green Bamboo, weighed approx 4,500lb (2,045kg) and its spherical shape measured approx 45inches diameter with a 72-point implosion system. This Green Bamboo weapon was intended as the warhead for all projected British strategic delivery systems of the period; the Yellow Sun Stage 1 air-dropped bomb, and the Blue Steel air-launched stand-off missile. The large girth of these weapons was designed to accommodate the diameter of Green Bamboo's implosion sphere.|$|E
25|$|Proliferation resistance. In 2016, Nobel Laureate {{physicist}} Dr Carlo Rubbia, former Director General of CERN, {{claimed a}} {{primary reason for}} the United States cutting thorium reactor research in the 1970s {{is what makes it}} so attractive today: thorium is difficult to turn into a nuclear weapon.The LFTR resists diversion of its fuel to nuclear weapons in four ways: first, the thorium-232 breeds by converting first to protactinium-233, which then decays to uranium-233. If the protactinium remains in the reactor, small amounts of U-232 are also produced. U-232 has a decay chain product (thallium-208) that emits powerful, dangerous gamma rays. These are not a problem inside a reactor, but in a bomb, they complicate bomb manufacture, harm electronics and reveal the bomb's location. The second proliferation resistant feature {{comes from the fact that}} LFTRs produce very little plutonium, around 15kg per gigawatt-year of electricity (this is the output of a single large reactor over a year). This plutonium is also mostly Pu-238, which makes it unsuitable for <b>fission</b> <b>bomb</b> building, due to the high heat and spontaneous neutrons emitted. The third track, a LFTR doesn't make much spare fuel. It produces at most 9% more fuel than it burns each year, and it's even easier to design a reactor that makes only 1% more fuel. With this kind of reactor, building bombs quickly will take power plants out of operation, and this is an easy indication of national intentions. And finally, use of thorium can reduce and eventually eliminate the need to enrich uranium. Uranium enrichment is one of the two primary methods by which states have obtained bomb making materials.|$|E
25|$|So-called neutron bombs (enhanced {{radiation}} weapons) {{have been}} constructed which release a larger fraction of their energy as ionizing radiation (specifically, neutrons), but these are all thermonuclear devices which rely on the nuclear fusion stage to produce the extra radiation. The energy dynamics of pure <b>fission</b> <b>bombs</b> always remain at about 6% yield of the total in radiation, as a prompt result of fission.|$|R
5000|$|A Star Trek: The Original Series episode, For the World Is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky, {{features}} a generation ship, constructed {{out of a}} hollowed-out iron asteroid, propelled by [...] "Orion class nuclear pulse engines" [...] in which <b>fission</b> <b>bombs</b> are detonated in shafts. It {{appeared to have been}} traveling for 10,000 years and had travelled 30 light years on its own power.|$|R

500|$|Considering {{the idea}} of the <b>fission</b> <b>bomb</b> {{theoretically}} settled—at least until more experimental data was available—the Berkeley conference then turned in a different direction. Edward Teller pushed for discussion of a more powerful bomb: the [...] "Super", usually referred to today as a [...] "hydrogen bomb", which would use the explosive force of a detonating <b>fission</b> <b>bomb</b> to ignite a nuclear fusion reaction between deuterium and tritium. Teller proposed scheme after scheme, but Bethe rejected each one. The fusion idea was set aside to concentrate on producing fission bombs. Teller also raised the speculative possibility that an atomic bomb might [...] "ignite" [...] the atmosphere because of a hypothetical fusion reaction of nitrogen nuclei, but Bethe calculated that this could not happen, and a report co-authored with Teller showed that [...] "no self-propagating chain of nuclear reactions is likely to be started".|$|E
500|$|The breakthrough—the {{details of}} which are still classified—was {{apparently}} {{the separation of the}} fission and fusion components of the weapons, and to use the X-rays produced by the <b>fission</b> <b>bomb</b> to first compress the fusion fuel (by process known as [...] "radiation implosion") before igniting it. Ulam's idea seems to have been to use mechanical shock from the primary to encourage fusion in the secondary, while Teller quickly realized that X-rays from the primary would do the job much more symmetrically. Some members of the laboratory (J. Carson Mark in particular) later expressed the opinion that the idea to use the x-rays would have eventually occurred to anyone working on the physical processes involved, and that the obvious reason why Teller thought of it right away was because he was already working on the [...] "Greenhouse" [...] tests for the spring of 1951, in which the effect of [...] x-rays from a <b>fission</b> <b>bomb</b> on a mixture of deuterium and tritium was going to be investigated.|$|E

[...] In Serber's account, Oppenheimer mentioned it to Arthur Compton, who [...] "didn't have enough sense to shut up about it. It somehow got into a document that went to Washington" [...] and was [...] "never laid to rest".|$|E
25|$|Nuclear bombs {{also produce}} very large {{quantities}} of neutrinos. Fred Reines and Clyde Cowan considered the detection of neutrinos from a bomb prior to their search for reactor neutrinos; a fission reactor was recommended as a better alternative by Los Alamos physics division leader J.M.B. Kellogg. <b>Fission</b> <b>bombs</b> produce antineutrinos (from the fission process), and fusion bombs produce both neutrinos (from the fusion process) and antineutrinos (from the initiating fission explosion).|$|R
25|$|Most {{tests were}} {{considerably}} more modest, {{and worked for}} direct technical purposes {{as well as their}} potential political overtones. Weapons improvements took on two primary forms. One was an increase in efficiency and power, and within only a few years <b>fission</b> <b>bombs</b> were developed that were many times more powerful than the ones created during World War II. The other was a program of miniaturization, reducing the size of the nuclear weapons.|$|R
50|$|On 27 September 1956, Operation Buffalo {{commenced}} at Maralinga, as Emu Field {{was found}} to be too remote a site. The operation consisted of the testing of four <b>fission</b> <b>bombs.</b> Two were exploded from towers; one at ground level and one was released by a Royal Air Force Vickers Valiant bomber from a height of 30,000 ft (9,144 m). This was the first launching of a British atomic weapon from an aircraft.|$|R
