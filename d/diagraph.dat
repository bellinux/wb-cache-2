50|$|The Scripts for Transcription The Roman scripts, as {{is used in}} {{the country}} today, are inclusively (learning once for all) adopted for Standard Mishing Language. Creation of {{additional}} symbols for the purpose of denoting central variants of /e/ and /i/ is negated for technology and mechanical contemplations. Rather, the aim of ‘maximum writing with minimum alphabetical letters’ is taken on. The addition of a new phonetic character and then putting them in alphabetical order in computer technology is by no means an easy task for a small community like the Mishings. Creation of extra symbol in the alphabetical matrix is tantamount to creation of new technology; and for us that becomes unfeasible, widely constrained by scare resources and times, which may wisely be avoided for speedy growth of the language. Standard Mishing Language has necessarily recognized altogether 15 vowel-sounds, of which 8 are shorts and 7 are of long variety, and 25 consonant-sounds (b, bh, ch, d, dh, g, gh, h, j, kh, l, m, n, ng, ny, p, ph, r, s, sh, t, th, v, w, y).

Accordingly, we propose to broaden the scope of Construction Grammar to include not only symbolic units that are conventionalized in a larger speech community, but also a dimension of online syntax, i. e. the emergence of grammatical patterns at the micro-level of a single conversation. Drawing on dialogic data from political talk shows and parliamentary debates, we illustrate the spectrum of these ad hoc constructional routines and show their local productivity, which we take as an indication of their (micro-) entrenchment within a given conversation. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDouble-loop {{networks}} {{have been widely}} studied as an architecture for local area networks. It {{is well known that}} the minimum distance diagram of a double-loop network yields an L-shape. Given a positive integer N, it is desirable to find a double-loop network with its diameter being the minimum among all double-loop networks with N nodes. Since the diameter of a double-loop network can be easily computed from its L-shape, one method is to start with a desirable L-shape and then find a double-loop network to realize it. This is a problem discussed by many authors [F. Aguiló, M. A. Fiol, An efficient algorithm to find optimal double loop networks, Discrete Math. 138 (1995) 15 – 29, R. C. Chan, C. Y. Chen, Z. X.

40|$|A {{central concern}} of {{education}} internationally and in South Africa {{is to develop}} children‟s literacy skill. However a literacy crisis exists in spite of efforts to counter this. Some researchers have explored the issue of literacy focusing on second language learners‟ spelling in English as Additional Language. There is, however, insufficient literature that looks into spelling experiences of isiXhosa background learners in English First Additional Language. Hence this study investigated the nature of spelling errors of Grade three isiXhosa background learners in English First Additional Language. In understanding the nature of spelling errors of Grade three isiXhosa background learners, the features of words that learners find difficult to spell and the features of words that learners find easy to spell were investigated. Moreover, learners‟ barriers in acquiring spelling skills in English First Additional Language and teacher practices for teaching spelling were examined.

40|$|The key {{hypothesis}} {{of this work}} represented the question, if mimicking the zonal composition and structural porosity of musculoskeletal tissues influences invading cells positively and leads to advantageous results for tissue engineering. Conventional approaches in tissue engineering are limited in producing monolithic “scaffolds” that provide locally variating biological key signals and pore architectures, imitating the alignment of collagenous fibres in bone and cartilage tissues, respectively. In order to fill this gap in available tissue engineering strategies, a new fabrication technique was evolved {{for the production of}} scaffolds to validate the hypothesis. Therefore, a new solidification based platform procedure was developed. This process comprises the directional solidification of multiple flowable precursors that are “cryostructured” to prepare a controlled anisotropic pore structure. Porous scaffolds are attained through ice crystal removal by lyophilisation. Optionally, electrostatic spinning of polymers may be applied to provide an external mesh on top or around the scaffolds. A consolidation step generates monolithic matrices from multi zonal structures. To serve as matrix for tissue engineering approaches or direct implantation as medical device, the scaffold is sterilized. 	 An Adjustable Cryostructuring Device (ACD) was successively developed; individual parts were conceptualized by computer aided design (CAD) and assembled. During optimisation, a significant performance improvement of the ACDs accessible external temperature gradient was achieved, from (1. 3 ± 0. 1) K/mm to (9. 0 ± 0. 1) K/mm. Additionally, four different configurations of the device were made available that enabled the directional solidification of collagenous precursors in a highly controlled manner with various sample sizes and shapes. By using alginate as a model substance the process was systematically evaluated. Cryostructuring <b>diagraphs</b> were analysed yielding solidification parameters, which were associated to pore sizes and alignments that were determined by image processing. Thereby, a precise control over pore size and alignment through electrical regulation of the ACD could be demonstrated. To obtain tissue mimetic scaffolds for the musculoskeletal system, collagens and calcium phosphates had to be prepared to serve as raw materials. Extraction and purification protocols were established to generate collagen I and collagen II, while the calcium phosphates brushite and hydroxyapatite were produced by precipitation reactions. 	 Besides the successive augmentation of the ACD also an optimization of the processing steps was crucial. Firstly, the concentrations and the individual behaviour of respective precursor components had to be screened. Together with the insights gained by videographic examination of solidifying collagen solutions, essential knowledge was gained that facilitated the production of more complex scaffolds. Phenomena of ice crystal growth during cryostructuring were discussed. By evolutionary steps, a cryostructuring of multi-layered precursors with consecutive anisotropic pores could be achieved and successfully transferred from alginate to collagenous precursors. Finally, very smooth interfaces that were hardly detectable by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) could be attained. For the used collagenous systems, a dependency relation between adjustable processing parameters and different resulting solidification morphologies was created. 	 Dehydrothermal-, diisocyanate-, and carbodiimide- based cross linking methods were evaluated, whereby the “zero length” cross linking by carbodiimide was found to be most suitable. Afterwards, a formulation for the cross linking solution was elaborated, which generated favourable outcomes by application inside a reduced pressure apparatus. As a consequence, a pore collapse during wet chemical cross linking could be avoided. 	 Complex monolithic scaffolds featuring continuous pores were fabricated that mimicked structure and respective composition of different areas of native tissues by the presence of biochemical key stimulants. At first, three types of bone scaffolds were produced from collagen I and hydroxyapatite with appropriate sizes to fit critical sized defects in rat femurs. They either featured an isotropic or anisotropic porosity and partly also contained glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Furthermore, meniscus scaffolds were prepared by processing two precursors with biomimetic contents of collagen I, collagen II and GAGs. Here, the pore structures were created under boundary conditions, which allowed an ice crystal growth that was nearly orthogonal to the external temperature gradient. Thereby, the preferential alignment of collagen fibres in the natural meniscus tissue could be mimicked. Those scaffolds owned appropriate sizes for cell culture in well plates or even an authentic meniscus shape and size. Finally, osteochondral scaffolds, sized to either fit well plates or perfusion reactors for cell culture, were fabricated to mimic the composition of subchondral bone and different cartilage zones. Collagen I and the resorbable calcium phosphate brushite were used for the subchondral zone, whereas the cartilage zones were composed out of collagen I, collagen II and tissue mimetic contents of GAGs. The pore structure corresponded to the one that is dominating the volume of natural osteochondral tissue. 	 Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and SEM were used to analyse the composition and pore structure of the individual scaffold zones, respectively. The cross section pore diameters were determined to (65 ± 25) µm, (88 ± 35) µm and(93 ± 42) µm for the anisotropic, the isotropic and GAG containing isotropic bone scaffolds. Furthermore, the meniscus scaffolds showed pore diameters of (93 ± 21) µm in the inner meniscus zone and (248 ± 63) µm inside the outer meniscus zone. Pore sizes of (82 ± 25) µm, (83 ± 29) µm and (85 ± 39) µm were present inside the subchondral, the lower chondral and the upper chondral zone of osteochondral scaffolds. Depending on the fabrication parameters, the respective scaffold zones were also found to feature a specific micro- and nanostructure at their inner surfaces.
