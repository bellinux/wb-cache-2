METHODS: In all, 87 OCT scans of 82 eyes with nAMD undergoing monitoring post ranibizumab treatment were taken using the Zeiss Stratus (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Jena, Germany; n= 87) together with their corresponding <b>infra-red</b> <b>images.</b> Fundus colour photographs were also taken. These images were reviewed by an experienced assessor, and a ranibizumab treatment decision was made during a multidisciplinary team retinal image review meeting. RESULTS: In all, 30 OCT scans (34. 5 %) showed intraretinal or subretinal oedema. A total of 24 colour photographs (19. 5 %) demonstrated retinal haemorrhage. Corresponding OCT <b>infra-red</b> <b>images</b> gave poor sensitivity in detecting haemorrhages (0. 176). In 16. 7 % of decisions to treat, haemorrhage alone was the deciding factor. Signs of disease activity seen only on colour photography were the deciding factor in clinical decisions for 8 % of scans assessed. CONCLUSIONS: The presence or increase of intra-retinal oedema is an important sign of activity triggering ranibizumab retreatment, but some eyes show signs of retinal haemorrhage without coexisting oedema. These haemorrhages are often only seen on either colour imaging or fundoscopy and are unclear or invisible on OCT scans and <b>infra-red</b> <b>images.</b> Therefore, although retinal colour photography creates additional expense, it is indispensable for making informed retreatment decisions, if patients are monitored using retinal imaging alone...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObject {{detection}} {{in outdoor}} environments is a challenging task. One {{is not only}} confronted {{with the problem of}} acquiring a sufficient amount of training images, but also the issue of huge variation in the objects appearance due to changing weather and light conditions. When using appearance-based object detection algorithms, such as in this paper, dimensional reduction of input data is an integral component to reduce computational costs and improve reliability. Based on the probabilistic classification method of Gaussian classifiers this paper examines the effect different dimensional reduction approaches have on the classification performance of thermal infra-red object images with respect to incomplete training data. It is shown that in the detection task at hand, which is to find the rear end of a truck in a thermal <b>infra-red</b> <b>image,</b> a reduction approach that combines principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is less sensitive to missing data...|$|E

40|$|Multi-modal image {{sequence}} {{registration is}} a challenging problem that consists in aligning two image sequences {{of the same}} scene acquired with a different sensor, hence containing different characteristics. We focus in this paper on the registration of optical and <b>infra-red</b> <b>image</b> sequences acquired during the flight of a helicopter.

We demonstrate the improvement in the results using synthetic imagery for which ground truth is known. We then demonstrate the algorithm on two images of outdoor scenes.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} vehicle recognition, in particular, for recognizing a vehicle's make and model. Our system is designed {{to take into account}} the fact that vehicles of the same make and model number come in different colors; to deal with this problem, our system employs <b>infra-red</b> <b>images,</b> thereby eliminating color differences. Another reason for the use of <b>infra-red</b> <b>images</b> is that it enables us to use the same algorithm both day and night. This ability is particularly important because the algorithm must be able to locate many feature points, especially at night. Our algorithm is based on configuration of local features. For the algorithm, our system first makes a compressed database of local features of a target vehicle from training images given in advance; the system then matches a set of local features in the input image with those in training images for recognition. This method has the following three advantages: (1) It can detect even if part of the target vehicle is occluded. (2) It can detect even if the target vehicle is translated due to running out of the lanes. (3) It does not require us to segment a vehicle part from input images. We havetwo implementations of the algorithm. One is referred to as the eigen-window method, while the other is called the vector-quantaization method. The former method is good at recognition, but is not very fast. The latter method is not very good at recognition but it is suitable for an IMAP parallel image-processing board; hence, it can be fast...|$|R

Yet, the quantity and variety of time-series data can be quite overwhelming as well as onerous to decipher and present.

These circumstances challenge the conventional way we present accumulated data and their processed outputs {{in order to get a}} better understanding of how and why the environmental performance occurred. It would be ideal if all of the collected and processed data could be presented in a simultaneous, yet, useful format.

The aims {{of this study were}} to assess the thermal effects by using Infra-red camera techniques and thermographic analysis and to find out how much electromagnetic fields from mobile phones contribute to increase the skin temperature due to thermal effects from chronic exposure to Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) mobile phone radiation. Eighty female Sprague Dawley rats were employed throughout the experiment, and the animals were dealt into four groups, control, 15, 30 and 60 days respectively (n= 20) for 1 h/day whole body expo-sure at SAR levels of 0. 048 W/Kg. GSM-like signals at a frequency of 1800 MHz were provided by a signal generator.
