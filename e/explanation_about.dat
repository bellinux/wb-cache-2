5|$|Scully {{turns up}} {{comatose}} {{in a hospital}} three months later with no <b>explanation</b> <b>about</b> how she got there. X provides Mulder with information allowing him to take revenge on her captors, but Mulder is instead convinced by Scully's sister Melissa to visit her bedside. Scully recovers and returns to work shortly thereafter. The agents later investigate a case involving alien biology being injected into teenagers in Wisconsin, and once again they encounter Deep Throat's killer, who is killed by the local sheriff.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{to the use of}} visual effects, the closing sequence required ADR due to the sound of rain on the original filming. The visual effects were the director Dan Zeff's idea, and the writers were pleased that they were within budget. They also serve to tie the final shot to the opening shot of the episode, as both feature a raven. Scenes that were cut down in the editing process included the initial meeting between the witchfinders—Warren and Clarke—and Sir Andrew Pike, and a private discussion between Warren and Clarke after {{the first day of the}} trial. The extended versions of the scenes featured an <b>explanation</b> <b>about</b> the Devil being found in everyday objects and a discussion about the stages of torture respectively. Shearsmith expressed frustration that these extra scenes could not be included on the DVD release.|$|E

25|$|Fear may be {{politically}} and culturally manipulated to persuade citizenry of ideas which {{would otherwise be}} widely rejected or dissuade citizenry from ideas which would otherwise be wildly supported. In contexts of disasters, nation-states manage the fear not only to provide their citizens with an <b>explanation</b> <b>about</b> the event or blaming some minorities, but also to adjust their previous beliefs. The manipulation of fear is done by means of symbolic instruments as terror movies and the administration ideologies that lead to nationalism. After a disaster, the fear is re-channeled in a climate of euphoria based on patriotism.|$|E
25|$|Lincoln and Jordan find McCord, who {{explains}} {{that all the}} facility residents are clones of wealthy and/or desperate sponsors, who are kept ignorant about {{the real world and}} conditioned to never question their environment or history. McCord provides the name of Lincoln's sponsor in Los Angeles, and helps them to the Yucca maglev station, before mercenaries kill him. In New York, Jordan's sponsor, model Sarah Jordan, is comatose following a car crash and requires transplants from Jordan to survive. Lincoln's sponsor, Tom Lincoln, gives Lincoln some <b>explanation</b> <b>about</b> the cloning institute, causing Lincoln to realise that he has gained Tom's memories. Tom agrees to help Lincoln and Jordan but secretly contacts Merrick, who sends Laurent and the mercenaries to their location. Lincoln tricks Laurent into shooting Tom, allowing him to assume Tom's identity.|$|E
25|$|Especially in Finland, Vainio's {{positive}} {{test result}} was a big scandal and provoked public indignation. Although Vainio's positive doping test after the Rotterdam Marathon was unofficial because of the missing B-sample, public pressure forced the Finnish Athletics Association to disqualify all of Vainio's results after Rotterdam and to discharge Antti Lanamäki from his duties. Vainio himself {{did not want to}} provide detailed information about the incident, probably partly because he was himself still investigating the reasons for the positive test result. Finnish mass media demanded an explanation, and one story released to the public alleged that Vainio's training partner, janitor Alpo Nyrönen, had given Vainio a hormone injection by accident, instead of the intended Vitamin B injection. Vainio himself released the <b>explanation</b> <b>about</b> the confusion between anabolic steroids and testosterone only several years after the incident.|$|E

25|$|The Petition {{was read}} {{in front of}} the members of the People's Representative Council (DPR) on 13 May 1980 in an effort to persuade the representatives to ask the {{president}} what he had meant by the two speeches. The delegation to the legislature was led by Maj. Gen. (ret.) Dr Azis Saleh. On 3 July 1980, 19 DPR produced a document containing two number of questions to the president. They asked whether the president agreed that the Expression of Concern contained important issues deserving the attention of all sides, especially the legislature and the government, and whether the people of Indonesia deserved a comprehensive and detailed <b>explanation</b> <b>about</b> the issues raised. These questions were passed on to the president in a letter on 14 July. The questions provoked a variety of reactions in the House. One DPR member, Soedardji, did not agree the president had to answer the questions. However, his party colleague Anwar Nuris said it was a normal part of the constitutional process.|$|E
25|$|At this point, the {{controversy}} surrounding the BCS became a topic of conversation within the United States government. In 2008 U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) had {{said that he would}} hold congressional hearings on the BCS in the future after his Utah team failed to play in the national championship game. Following up on Senator Hatch's actions in the Senate, in April 2011 the Attorney General of Utah announced that he would be initiating a class action anti-trust lawsuit against the BCS, despite the fact that Utah is joining to the Pacific-10 Conference, which is an automatic qualifying conference. In May 2011 the U.S. Justice Department {{sent a letter to the}} NCAA asking for a detailed <b>explanation</b> <b>about</b> why FBS football was the only NCAA sport that the NCAA did not 1) have a playoff system in place to determine a champion and 2) why the NCAA had abrogated its responsibility to do so and given the authority to determine the NCAA Champion to an outside group such as the BCS. The Justice Department's investigation and Utah Attorney General's lawsuit are both aimed at forcing the BCS to open its books, which they are as a non-profit required to do every year and have never done, and at determining whether the BCS is an illegal trust or cartel based on Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1890, the Clayton Anti-Trust Act of 1914 and the Robinson-Patman Anti-Price Discrimination Act. Two more states Attorneys General are said to be considering joining the Utah lawsuit, and the investigation by the Justice Department will probably include a minute and extensive examination of the Fiesta Bowl Scandal as well as conducting complete audits of the other BCS Bowls, the BCS itself and possibly even the schools of the 6 BCS Automatic Qualification Conferences.|$|E

500|$|Sally Foster from Film Threat praised its visuals and [...] "a {{few good}} Japanese-style creep-out scenes" [...] but {{described}} the storyline as [...] "incomprehensible" [...] due to [...] "the overabundance" [...] {{of information about}} its mythology. John Sinnott of DVD Talk asserted the film could not reach {{the quality of the}} manga; he cited the lack of <b>explanation</b> <b>about</b> Ginko's background as one of the reasons. Sinnott criticized its slow pace considering its duration and said that [...] "there isn't much mystery or suspense." [...] Anthony Enticknap from Den of Geek said its plot is [...] "complex at times, and often drifts into the realms of the incomprehensible". Although he criticized the film's [...] "pedestrian" [...] pace, Enticknap praised Omori's performance as well as the film's cinematography and use of CGI. While praising Odagiri's acting and deeming the film's visuals an [...] "A-game", DVD Verdict's Adam Arseneau said it [...] "feels disjointed and fragmented".|$|E

500|$|Homer is the bumbling {{husband of}} Marge {{and father of}} Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson. He {{is the son of}} Mona and Abraham [...] "Grampa" [...] Simpson. Homer held over 188 {{different}} jobs in the first 400 episodes of The Simpsons. In most episodes, he works as the Nuclear Safety Inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, a position he has held since [...] "Homer's Odyssey", the third episode of the series. At the plant, Homer is often ignored and completely forgotten by his boss Mr. Burns, and constantly falls asleep and neglects his duties. Matt Groening has stated that he decided to have Homer work at the power plant because of the potential for Homer to wreak havoc. Each of his other jobs has lasted only one episode. In {{the first half of the}} series, the writers developed an <b>explanation</b> <b>about</b> how he got fired from the plant and was then rehired in every episode. In later episodes, he often began a new job on impulse, without any mention of his regular employment.|$|E
500|$|Sesame Street head writer Norman Stiles {{was chosen}} to write the {{segments}} about Mr. Hooper's death. [...] The episode focused on {{the life cycle of}} birth and death by also mentioning the birth of a baby, and by remembering Mr. Hooper. [...] Stiles said, [...] "We decided to say that while Mr. Hooper was not here anymore, we will always have that part of him that lives within the heart, that we have our love and that it will always stay". [...] Stiles wanted to convey that expressing grief for someone who had died was difficult for both adults and children. [...] Instead of providing an explanation, the adults of Sesame Street tell Mr. Hooper's friend Big Bird, when he asked why Mr. Hooper had died, that there was no real reason, that it happened, as Gordon tells Big Bird, [...] "Just because". [...] The show's outside experts advised Stiles and the producers to remove the line because they were concerned that an open-ended explanation would not be enough for children, but Stiles kept the line because it was an acknowledgement, as Gikow stated, that there is never a good <b>explanation</b> <b>about</b> why people die.|$|E
500|$|One {{of the key}} {{goals of}} 4A Games was to improve and refine {{numerous}} aspects of 2033 which THQ described as a [...] "flawed masterpiece". The strong focus on atmosphere was retained, but the team overhauled numerous gameplay mechanics. The game's shooting mechanics were improved, and the firearms featured in the game were no longer underpowered. The animation system was reworked and more visual effects were added. The game's artificial intelligence was also refined to become more responsive to players' actions. After hearing from players about 2033s bullet-based economic system, the team decided to keep the feature in Last Light but improve the <b>explanation</b> <b>about</b> how it worked so that players would not be confused by it. [...] In addition, the team revealed {{that they would not}} westernize the franchise to attract a larger audience. Instead, they would overhaul the game's controls to make it more accessible. The team also drastically improved the game's stealth sections. The core philosophy in designing these sections was [...] "fun"; players would not be punished too harshly if they made any mistakes, such as making too much noise. As a result, the alertness of the artificial intelligence features several different levels, making the game more realistic. A competitive multiplayer mode was originally planned that was said to be unique to the Metro series, and would not simply include typical multiplayer modes like team deathmatch or Capture the Flag. However, it was eventually cancelled; but the possibility of having a multiplayer mode remained, and it could be developed after the game's release.|$|E
