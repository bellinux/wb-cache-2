50|$|The device {{itself has}} a single Mini DisplayPort output {{and in order to}} connect two <b>external</b> <b>displays</b> one can {{additionally}} use a secondary Mini DisplayPort on a docking station accessory (sold separately). To attach three (or fewer) displays, an aftermarket DisplayPort Multi-Stream Transport hub can be used or a daisy chaining feature of compatible <b>displays.</b> One of <b>external</b> <b>displays</b> can be attached over-the-air utilizing Intel Wireless Display (WiDi) technology.|$|R

25|$|Released October 26, 2007, the Sansa TakeTV {{is an easy}} to use {{plug-and-play}} {{storage device}} that allows the playback of DivX, Xvid, and M-PEG 4 files on an <b>external</b> <b>display</b> via the included dock and remote. Unlike other Sansa products, the TakeTV is not a digital audio player. The device comes in 4 and 8GB. While the user is free to use his own videos, TakeTV comes with FanFare, a program similar to iTunes, allowing the user to purchase premium content. On December 11, NBC Universal signed up with SanDisk to provide content on FanFare after having left Apple Inc in a similar deal. The TakeTV along with FanFare was discontinued on May 15, 2008.|$|E
25|$|Windows Vista aims {{to simplify}} the detection, configuration, and {{installation}} of external displays and projectors by introducing a standardized setup procedure and interface. The WDDM architecture in Windows Vista enables hot plug detection of external displays and alerts the new Transient Multimon Manager (TMM) when an <b>external</b> <b>display</b> is connected to a system, which then presents an Aero Wizard interface for the configuration and setup of the display. In previous versions of Windows, installation routines for displays often varied based on hardware configurations such as function keys and specific manufacturer requirements, and typically required separate software interfaces. When possible, the TMM also saves user preferences for individual displays to improve mobility scenarios as these preferences can then be restored when a display is reconnected at a different time or location. The aforementioned improvements are intended to enable a display connectivity experience that provides the ease of use observed with plug and play peripherals.|$|E
25|$|Sony added TV {{output to}} the PSP Slim through Firmware update 3.60. It can output in a {{conventional}} aspect ratio (4:3) or widescreen (16:9), and offers a screensaver if the PSP is inactive for a set amount of time. It is able to output games, videos, and other media. To achieve TV output on the Slim model, Composite, S-Video, Component (YPBPR) and D-Terminal (YPBPR) cables are sold separately by Sony. PSP format games are output as a progressive scan signal, which can be carried only by the Component and D-Terminal cables, and displayed on televisions which support progressive scan. They are also rendered at the 480×272 resolution of the PSP screen, rather than the 720×480 resolution used for output, and are not upscaled, meaning that they are displayed with black windowboxing when viewed to an <b>external</b> <b>display.</b> This can be overcome on some TVs by using built-in zoom functionality. However, the PSP system software, music player and video playback are displayed in full-screen. As of firmware update 5.00, PlayStation (PSone) format software purchased from the PlayStation store is output in full-screen mode and optionally in interlaced format for non-progressive displays. The maximum resolution through TV output is 720×480 pixels and composite video uses NTSC color encoding (no PAL composite signal is available; European TVs must be NTSC compatible {{to be used with}} a PSP via composite). The old PSP-1000 model is not capable of this feature due to a slightly different port. As a result, original PSP accessories (using the connector) will not work with the Slim and the Slim's accessories will not work with the original PSP. Sony released {{a new version of the}} remote control accessory designed for the Slim as a result. The PSP Slim can still use 3.5mm headphones, like the old PSP-1000. The Serial Port is not available on the PSP-E1000, thus it can't have TV-output and remote controls connected.|$|E

500|$|On January 21, 2015, Microsoft {{unveiled}} Windows 10 Mobile, an {{edition of}} Windows 10 for smartphones and sub-8-inch tablets running on ARM architecture; unlike RT, {{which was based}} upon the user experience of the PC version, Windows 10 on these devices {{is a continuation of}} the Windows Phone user experience that emphasizes the ability for developers to create [...] "universal" [...] Windows apps that can run across PC, tablet, and phone, and only supports the modern-style interface and Windows apps (although on compatible devices, a limited desktop experience will be available when connected to an <b>external</b> <b>display).</b> Following the event, a Microsoft spokesperson stated that the company was working on a Windows RT update that would provide [...] "some of the functionality of Windows 10", but declined to offer any further details. As such, Microsoft does not officially consider Windows RT to be a supported upgrade path to Windows 10. Shortly afterward, Microsoft ended production of both the Surface 2 and Lumia 2520.|$|E
2500|$|Kierkegaard {{began his}} 1843 book Either/Or with a question: [...] "Are passions, then, the pagans of the soul? Reason alone baptized?" [...] He didn't want to devote himself to Thought or Speculation like Hegel did. Faith, hope, love, peace, patience, joy, self-control, vanity, kindness, humility, courage, cowardliness, pride, deceit, and selfishness. These are the inner passions that Thought knows little about. Hegel begins {{the process of}} {{education}} with Thought but Kierkegaard thinks we could begin with passion, or {{a balance between the}} two, a balance between Goethe and Hegel. He was against endless reflection with no passion involved. But {{at the same time he}} did not want to draw more attention to the <b>external</b> <b>display</b> of passion but the internal (hidden) passion of the single individual. Kierkegaard clarified this intention in his Journals.|$|E
2500|$|Until January 2006 an Avro Vulcan bomber ( [...] XL391) was on static <b>external</b> <b>display</b> {{close to}} the {{entrance}} to the airport. XL391's last operational role was at Ascension Island during the Falklands conflict in 1982, however, it only flew as a backup aircraft and never actually went to the Falklands. It was put up for sale in October 2004 on eBay and purchased by Manchester pub landlord Chris Ollerenshaw (for £15,102.03) who had intentions to transport it to his pub and display it in his beer garden. However, after finding out that the condition of the aircraft was so poor that moving it would be extremely challenging and that it would cost over £20,000 in addition to the reported £1000 a week storage charge, Mr Ollerenshaw pulled out of the deal and later relinquished ownership of the plane back to the airport. The Vulcan was then sold on for scrap for £4,800 and was scrapped and completely removed from the site on 12 January 2006.|$|E
50|$|DockPort, {{formerly}} known as Lightning Bolt, is an extension to DisplayPort to include USB 3.0 data as well as power for charging portable devices from attached <b>external</b> <b>displays.</b> Originally developed by AMD and Texas Instruments, it has been announced as a VESA specification in 2014.|$|R
40|$|<b>External</b> <b>displays</b> {{have the}} {{potential}} to make smartphone notifications less obtrusive when a user has committed their attention to a primary task. We compare six notification displays, and evaluate the impact that negotiating smartphone interruptions has on a typing task when the number of notifications to ignore and act on are equal. A lab experiment with 30 participants is conducted, and initial results show that desktop pop-ups are preferred significantly more, where they require the fewest actions to read. Managing notifications via the notification bar is least preferred, despite requiring fewer actions to respond. This work is a well-controlled pre-cursor to the application of notification displays in social scenarios. The results motivate the use of <b>external</b> <b>displays</b> to manage attention around smartphone interruptions...|$|R

6000|$|... [Footnote: We {{learn from}} no less {{authority}} {{than that of}} Napoleon Bonaparte, that there is but a single step between the sublime and ridiculous; {{and it is a}} transition from one extreme to another; so very easy, that the vulgar of every degree are peculiarly captivated with it. Thus the inclination to laugh becomes uncontrollable, when the solemnity and gravity of time, place, and circumstances, render it peculiarly improper. Some species of general license, like that which inspired the ancient Saturnalia, or the modern Carnival, has been commonly indulged to the people at all times and in almost all countries. But it was, I think, peculiar to the Roman Catholic Church, that while they studied how to render their church rites imposing and magnificent, by all that pomp, music, architecture, and <b>external</b> <b>display</b> could add to them, they nevertheless connived, upon special occasions, at the frolics of the rude vulgar, who, in almost all Catholic countries, enjoyed, or at least assumed, the privilege of making: some Lord of the revels, who, under the name of the Abbot of Unreason, the Boy Bishop, or the President of Fools, occupied the churches, profaned the holy places by a mock imitation of the sacred rites, and sung indecent parodies on hymns of the church. The indifference of the clergy, even when their power was greatest, to the indecent exhibitions which they always tolerated, and sometimes encouraged, forms a strong contrast to the sensitiveness with which they regarded any serious attempt, by preaching or writing, to impeach any of the doctrines of the church. It could only be compared to the singular apathy with which they endured, and often admired the gross novels which Chaucer, Dunbar, Boccacio, Bandello, and others, composed upon the bad morals of the clergy. It seems as if the churchmen in both instances had endeavoured to compromise with the laity, and allowed them occasionally to gratify their coarse humour by indecent satire, provided they would abstain from any grave question concerning the foundation of the doctrines on which was erected such an immense fabric of ecclesiastical power.|$|E
