5|$|Diseases {{may also}} affect the {{pericardium}} which surrounds the heart, which when inflamed is called pericarditis. This {{may result from}} infective causes (such as glandular fever, cytomegalovirus, coxsackievirus, tuberculosis or Q fever), systemic disorders such as amyloidosis or sarcoidosis, tumours, high uric acid levels, and other causes. This inflammation affects {{the ability of the}} heart to pump effectively. When fluid builds up in the pericardium this is called pericardial <b>effusion,</b> which when it causes acute heart failure is called cardiac tamponade. This may be blood from a traumatic injury or fluid from an <b>effusion.</b> This can compress the heart and adversely affect the function of the heart. The fluid can be removed from the pericardial sac using a syringe in a procedure called pericardiocentesis.|$|E
40|$|SETTING: Tygerberg Hospital, an {{academic}} teaching hospital, Republic of South Africa. OBJECTIVE: To identify the adenosine deaminase (ADA) isoenzymes as a diagnostic tool for tuberculosis in pleural <b>effusions</b> with increased ADA activity. DESIGN: Patients (n = 157) with exudative <b>effusions</b> and ADA activities > 20 U/l, due to causes which satisfied predetermined diagnostic criteria, {{participated in the}} study. They consisted of 87 tuberculous <b>effusions,</b> 27 infective <b>effusions</b> (12 empyematous and 15 non-empyematous), 37 malignant <b>effusions</b> and six other exudative <b>effusions</b> (systemic lupus erythematosus, pancreatitis and lung embolus). In each case the ADA isoenzymes in the pleural fluid were identified using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In addition, microbiology and cytology (including differential cell counts) were also carried out. RESULTS: Although ADA(1 c), and ADA 2 were the predominant isoenzymes observed in tuberculous <b>effusions,</b> while ADA(1 c) and ADA(1 m) were predominant in infective non-empyematous <b>effusions,</b> no additional diagnostic value was obtained. In the case of neoplastic <b>effusions</b> and other exudates, determination of ADA isoenzyme patterns also did not assist in diagnosing these conditions. CONCLUSION: Determination of patterns of ADA isoenzymes does not enhance the overall diagnostic value of ADA activity in pleural <b>effusions.</b> Articl...|$|R

40|$|Summary: Lactoferrin was {{analysed}} with an ELISA in pleural <b>effusions</b> from 21 {{patients with}} malignant exudative <b>effusions</b> (15 carcinomas and 6 mesotheliomas), 12 patients with non-malignant exudative <b>effusions</b> of unknown aetiology, 11 patients with transudative <b>effusions</b> due to congestive heart failure, 12 patients with exudative <b>effusions</b> secondary to infection, and 2 patients with tuberculous <b>effusions.</b> Mediän pleural fluid lactoferrin was 133 g/l (ränge 25 - 435) in carcinomas, 55 g/l (23 - 185) in mesotheliomas, 198 g/l (31 - 530) in non-malignant exudates, 68 g/l (17 - 205) in transudates, 1815 g/l (1380 - 2050) in infectious exudates and 107 g/l (88 - 125) in tubercu-losis. Due {{to a wide}} overlap between the various groups pleural fluid lactoferrin appears to be of limited value in the routine diagnostic evaluation of non-infectious pleural <b>effusions,</b> but seems to separate infectious exudates from non-infectious exudates...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to assess the {{usefulness}} of soluble vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the <b>effusions</b> of patients with malignant and tuberculous diseases. Using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay, VEGF concentration was measured in malignant (n= 17) and tuberculous (n= 11) pleural <b>effusions.</b> Pleural biopsy, cytology or microbiological methods were used to make final diagnoses. Adenosine deaminase (ADA) levels in tuberculous pleural <b>effusions</b> were significantly higher than those in malignant pleural <b>effusions.</b> The median level of VEGF in patients with malignant <b>effusions</b> (median, 2418 pg/mL; range, 97 - 62103 pg/mL) was significantly higher than tuberculous <b>effusions</b> (median, 994 pg/mL; range, 44 - 3552 pg/mL). There were no significant differences in pleural VEGF levels in patients with different histological types of lung cancer. The VEGF level was not correlated with ADA, lactate dehydrogenase and total protein levels of pleural fluid. In conclusion, pleural VEGF levels in patients with malignant <b>effusions</b> were significantly higher than tuberculous <b>effusions,</b> and the measurement of pleural VEGF is helpful in discriminating between malignant and tuberculous <b>effusions.</b> Further studies are needed to determine the clinical value of VEGF as a tumor marker and a prognostic factor...|$|R

Results Parapneumonic <b>effusions</b> were characterized by higher pleural fluid 8 -isoprostane levels compared to transudative, malignant and tuberculous <b>effusions.</b> Pleural fluid Cu/Zn SOD levels were lower in transudates, while serum levels were higher in transudative compared to all exudative pleural <b>effusions.</b> Both pleural fluid 8 -isoprostane and Cu/Zn SOD were higher in complicated parapneumonic <b>effusions</b> and empyemas compared to uncomplicated parapneumonic <b>effusions.</b> Pleural fluid 8 -isoprostane was the most accurate test to differentiate between complicated and uncomplicated parapneumonic pleural <b>effusions</b> with a sensitivity of 100 % and a specificity of 58 center dot 1 % at a cut-off point of 35 center dot 1 (AUC = 0 center dot 848).

40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} {{that the process of}} hypoxic-reperfusion injury contributes to the persistence of synovitis in the inflamed human joint. The generation of pathological, exercise induced, intra-articular pressure leading to occlusion of the synovial microcirculation is central to this mechanism. However, acute traumatic inflammatory joint <b>effusions</b> rarely result in chronic synovitis, suggesting that either the basic hypothesis is incorrect, or that joints with acute traumatic <b>effusions</b> show different intra-articular pressure dynamics. In this study the intra-articular pressure was measured at rest and during isometric exercise in five patients with acute traumatic joint <b>effusions</b> and in nine patients with chronic inflammatory joint <b>effusions.</b> The generation of intra-articular pressure in the patients with acute traumatic <b>effusions</b> was significantly lower at rest (mean 2. 0 v 19. 6 mm Hg) and during exercise (mean 13. 7 v 222. 5 mm Hg) than in the patients with chronic <b>effusions.</b> This was due to reflex muscular inhibition around the joint, which inhibited the pathological generation of intra-articular pressure.
