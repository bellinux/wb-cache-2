5|$|Much like elephants, {{manatees}} are polyphyodonts, and continuously replace {{their teeth}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the jaw. Adults lack incisors, canines, and premolars, and instead have 8 to 10 cheek teeth in their mouth. Manatees have an infinite supply of teeth moving in <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> and shedding in the front, which are continuously formed by a dental capsule behind the tooth-row. These teeth are constantly worn {{down by the}} abrasive vascular plants they forage, particularly aquatic grasses. Unlike in manatees, the dugong's teeth do not continually grow back via horizontal tooth replacement. The dugong has two tusks which emerge in males during puberty, and sometime later in life for females after reaching {{the base of the}} premaxilla. The number of growth layer groups in a tusk indicates the age of a dugong.|$|E
5|$|The Sooners {{adopted a}} {{different}} jersey design in 2006, {{which included the}} removal of the players' last names <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the jersey due to the design of the uniform's shoulders and back, and a darker crimson color for the jersey and helmet.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} pit stops, the Mercedes drivers had {{to manage their}} tyres in order to cover from a {{possible}} attack by Ferrari, who had an extra set of fresh tyres saved from qualifying. Rosberg however complained over the radio about Hamilton {{in front of him}} driving too slow, which caused him to back into the charging Ferraris. He was unable to risk driving too close behind Hamilton, because dispersed air <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the car was accelerating tyre degradation. Hamilton was therefore asked by the team to pick up the pace.|$|E

5|$|At the Portuguese Grand Prix Hill charged <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of {{the grid}} to third, having stalled on the warm up lap from pole. He {{finished}} off the season finishing fourth in Japan and third in Australia, {{but it was not}} enough to hold 2nd place in the championship as Ayrton Senna passed him by winning the last two races. Prost finished the season as champion. Hill ended the season in Australia by setting the lap record for the Adelaide Street Circuit. As of 2017 (the full Grand Prix track has not been used since 2000), Hill's lap record of 1:15.381 for the 3.780km (2.349mi) long track still stands.|$|E
5|$|Blythe further {{testified that}} he was not under the {{influence}} of alcohol during the concert and that he had never used any drugs. Chris Adler, Lamb of God's drummer, {{testified that he}} had not seen anything <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the stage and further proclaimed that Blythe's aggressiveness is only a stage act. According to Adler, Blythe is a calm, moderate, and well-read person. The defense also presented videos from various Lamb of God concerts in order to demonstrate that metal music is very energetic and that Blythe regularly cheers to the crowd, but not to encourage people to climb the stage.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches {{are among}} the hardiest insects. Some species are capable of {{remaining}} active for a month without food {{and are able to}} survive on limited resources, such as the glue <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of postage stamps. Some can go without air for 45 minutes. Japanese cockroach (Periplaneta japonica) nymphs, which hibernate in cold winters, survived twelve hours at −5°C to −8°C in laboratory experiments.|$|E

5|$|During {{human and}} all {{vertebrate}} development, {{a series of}} pharyngeal arch pairs form in the developing embryo. These project forward <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the embryo towards {{the front of the}} face and neck. Each arch develops its own artery, nerve that controls a distinct muscle group, and skeletal tissue. The arches are numbered from 1 to 6, with 1 being the arch closest {{to the head of the}} embryo, and the fifth arch only existing transiently.|$|E
5|$|Fernando Alonso {{began the}} weekend's event knowing {{he would start}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the grid due {{to a number of}} {{penalties}} incurred for changing engine parts. Honda provided him with an upgraded internal combustion engine, which had been designed using the team's last four in-season development tokens. Alonso's McLaren teammate Jenson Button had to continue using the old-specification engine at this race as Honda only had one of the upgraded power units available. However, Alonso used the new power unit only in the first practice session before switching back to the older unit, albeit voicing satisfaction with the performance of the new specification.|$|E
5|$|In March 2006, the {{remaining}} Vertigo Tour concerts were postponed when {{the daughter of}} guitarist The Edge fell ill. During the interim, footage from the seven filmed shows was edited together, prompting the crew to request additional wide shots <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the stadium and close-ups of the band members. When the tour was on its fifth leg in November 2006, an additional two shows were filmed in Melbourne to capture the extra footage. At the time, the songs appearing in the final cut of the film had already been selected and therefore only specific songs from the concerts were filmed.|$|E

5|$|Many clubs provide {{training}} for new pilots. The student flies with an instructor in a two-seat glider fitted with dual controls. The instructor performs the first launches and landings, typically <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> seat, but otherwise the student manages the controls until {{the student is}} deemed to have the skill and the airmanship necessary to fly solo. Simulators are also beginning {{to be used in}} training, especially during poor weather.|$|E
5|$|Murphy {{finds an}} ice core sample {{believed}} to originate from a meteor crater, and theorizes {{that the sample}} might be 250,000 years old. Although Bear insists on leaving, the others are concerned about infecting the outside world. When he is asked to provide a stool sample, he attacks Mulder and tries to flee. Something moves under Bear's skin, and he dies when Hodge removes a small worm <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of his neck. Now without a pilot, the group is informed that evacuation is impossible because of the weather.|$|E
5|$|Tammi {{returns from}} the bank and gets back in her car. Dwight surprises her <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> seat and puts a gun to her head, and tells her to drive. Dwight comes to the {{conclusion}} that Randall killed Chase because he and Tammi were together. Dwight hands Randall a gun and tells him to shoot Tammi. Tammi tries to talk Randall out of it but Randall shoots through the wall next to her and kills Dwight. Randall is eventually arrested, but Tammi successfully manages to run away.|$|E

Murray was up 5–1 when he hit a forehand <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the court and snapped the tendons in his wrist, leaving him out of action from 15 May until 7 August, thereby missing Wimbledon. During this rest period, Murray rose to world No. 8, but by 7 August, he had dropped to no 14.|$|E
5|$|The Lockheed D-21 was an American {{reconnaissance}} drone with {{maximum speed}} {{in excess of}} Mach3.3 (2,215mph; 3,564km/h). The D-21 was initially designed to be launched <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of a M-21 carrier aircraft, {{a variant of the}} Lockheed A-12 aircraft. Development began in October 1962. Originally known by the Lockheed designation Q-12, the drone was intended for reconnaissance deep in enemy airspace.|$|E
5|$|The Roseberys' {{house party}} would leave Dalmeny and tour {{towns and cities}} across Midlothian and Scotland, with Gladstone and the {{speakers}} often addressing vast crowds <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of an American-designed Pullman car specially acquired by Rosebery for the purpose. The scenes at these meetings {{have been described as}} something between a carnival and an evangelist's revival meeting. While in the grounds of Dalmeny House itself, the public were treated to a great firework display.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Company H {{attempted}} to deploy at five-yard intervals {{along the ridge}} while still mounted. This proved disastrous, since the horses were flighty and the troop inexperienced and unable to shoot <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> of their terrified horses.|$|R
50|$|Protocooperation {{can occur}} in birds. The Egyptian plover removes insect pests <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> of buffalo, antelope, giraffes, and rhinos. The cattle egret in America as well does the same task of {{removing}} the unwanted insects and parasites.|$|R

5|$|The black {{wildebeest}} has a {{dark brown}} or black coat which is slightly paler {{in summer and}} coarser and shaggier in the winter. Calves are born with shaggy, fawn-coloured fur. Males are darker than females. They have bushy and dark-tipped manes that, as in the blue wildebeest, stick up <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> of the neck. The hairs which compose this are white or cream-coloured with dark tips. On its muzzle and under its jaw it has black bristly hair. It also has long, dark-coloured hair between its forelegs and under its belly. Other physical features include a thick neck, a plain back, and rather small and beady eyes.|$|E
5|$|The first {{remains were}} found in a bonebed {{discovered}} in 1989, which produced numerous ribs and vertebrae <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> and tail, {{as well as many}} limb bones, but no skull material aside from one tooth. Four osteoderms of different sizes and shapes were also recovered from this bonebed. This material comes from several different individuals. Since 1989, more material has been uncovered in the same region of France, including a relatively complete skeleton with some elements of the skull and lower jaw.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecution}} {{case was}} that Bamber, motivated by hatred and greed, had left White House Farm around 10pm on 6 August 1985, after dining with his family, {{to drive to}} his home in Head Street, Goldhanger. Later, perhaps {{in the early hours of}} the morning of 7 August, he had returned to the farm on his mother's bicycle—which he had borrowed a few days earlier—cycling along a route that avoided the main roads and approaching the house <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>back.</b> He had entered the house through a downstairs bathroom window, taken the rifle with the silencer attached, and gone upstairs.|$|E
