50|$|Once this {{spectral}} {{information is}} extracted, {{it can be}} compared to an existing database containing information about the targets that the system will identify and a decision can be made as to what the <b>illuminated</b> <b>target</b> is. This is done by modeling the received signal then using a statistical estimation method such as maximum likelihood (ML), majority voting (MV) or maximum a posteriori (MAP) {{to make a decision about}} which target in the library best fits the model built using the received signal.|$|E
50|$|Target {{recognition}} {{was done}} for years by playing the baseband signal to the operator. Listening to this signal, trained radar operators can identify various pieces {{of information about the}} <b>illuminated</b> <b>target,</b> such as the type of vehicle it is, the size of the target, and can potentially even distinguish biological targets. However there are many limitations to this approach. The operator must be trained for what each target will sound like, if the target is traveling at a high speed it may no longer be audible, and the human decision component makes the probability of error high. However, this idea of audibly representing the signal did provide a basis for automated classification of targets. Several classifications schemes that have been developed use features of the baseband signal that have been used in other audio applications such as speech recognition.|$|E

In addition, the inability to adjust radar stations RAP-150 elevation with frequent change of position, lack of agility stations and the difficulty masking her forced to abandon the use of RAP-150 in mobile platoons.

50|$|Light from an {{origin point}} O is {{collimated}} (made parallel) {{by a high}} quality objective lens. If the collimated beam falls perpendicularly onto a plane reflecting surface, the light is reflected back along its original path and is brought to a focus at a point coincident with the origin point. If the reflector is tilted through an angle θ, the reflected beam is deflected through an angle 2θ, and the image I is displaced laterally from the origin 0.The amount of displacement is given by d=2θf where f is the focal length of the lens, and θ is in radians.Light from an <b>illuminated</b> <b>target</b> graticule at the focus of an objective lens is directed towards the lens by a beam splitter. After reflection by a mirror on the workpiece, the light returns through the Autocollimator and passes through the beam splitter, forming {{an image of the}} target graticule in the plane of an eyepiece graticule. The eyepiece graticule and the reflected image of the target graticule are viewed simultaneously through the eyepiece.The image of the target graticule is always seen in focus and at constant magnification in the eyepiece, regardless of the distance between the Autocollimator and the reflecting surface. However, at long working distances only a portion of the reflected target graticule may appear in the eyepiece, owing to the failure of obliquely returning rays to enter the Autocollimator. This will result in a restricted measuring range.|$|E

30|$|Beam {{allocation}} in {{phased array}} radar tracking {{is a well-known}} problem, {{and it has been}} addressed in a large body of literature [1 – 6] and the references therein. A goal of the allocation is to minimize the use of radar resources while maintaining a target under track. In the allocation for a track update, one of the principal parameters to be adjusted is transmitted power. The transmitted power has an impact on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of return signal from an <b>illuminated</b> <b>target.</b> The SNR is directly proportional to the transmitted power and the radar cross section (RCS) of the target [7, 8].|$|E
