Process Mapping is a general approach that traces the influence of process parameters to thermal behavior and feature development during AM processing. Previous work has focused mainly on Ti- 6 Al- 4 V (Ti 64), but this work uses novel mathematical derivations and adapted process mapping methodologies to construct new <b>geometric,</b> <b>thermal,</b> and microstructural process maps for Ti 64 and two nickel superalloy material systems.

This has resulted in a non-dimensional template for solidification behavior in terms of material solidification parameters and AM process parameters.

40|$|In {{the modern}} global economy, {{there is a}} demand for high {{precision}} in manufacture as competitive pressures drive businesses to seek greater productivity. This results in a demand for {{a reduction in the}} errors associated with CNC machine tools. To this end, it is useful to develop a greater understanding of the mechanisms which give rise to errors in machine tool drives. This programme of research covers the <b>geometric,</b> <b>thermal</b> and load errors commonly encountered on CNC machine tools. Several mathematical models have been developed or extended which enable {{a deeper understanding of the}} interaction between these errors, various details of ballscrew design and the dynamic behaviour of ballscrew driven systems. Some useful models based on the discrete matter or “lumped mass” approach have been devised. One extends the classical eigenvalue method for finding the natural frequencies and other dynamic characteristics of ballscrew systems to include viscous damping effects using a generalised eigenvalue approach. This gives the damping coefficient of each predicted vibration mode along with the estimates of the natural frequencies, enabling many of the natural frequencies predicted by standard undamped natural frequency analyses to be dismissed as being of little consequence to the vibratory behaviour of the system. A development of this modelling method gives the sensitivity of the system to changes in stiffness and damping characteristics, which is helpful at the preliminary design stage of a ballscrew system, and is an aid in deciding the most convenient remedy to vibration problems which may occur in service. The second set of lumped-mass models is specially developed to take account of the changes in the configuration of the system with time as the nut moves along the screw while taking into account the non-linear phenomena of backlash and Coulomb friction. These can deal with the axial, torsional and transverse degrees of freedom of the system and predict many aspects of the dynamic behaviour of a ballscrew system which have an effect on the errors arising from such systems. They also include features which calculate the energy converted to heat by all the energy dissipative mechanisms in the model which can be used in conjunction with models already developed at the University of Huddersfield to predict thermal errors. Further, a strategy for compensation of some of these errors has been devise...|$|E

40|$|Rapid {{prototyping}} (RP) is a {{large and}} rapidly growing industry with many different processes either under development or already available commercially. These processes offer fast and flexible production of objects {{from a wide range}} of materials. They vary from being able to produce only prototypes of products, through to being suitable for production of finished products ready for service. Rapid prototyping by robotic gas metal arc welding (GMAW) uses metal deposited by the GMAW process to build metal products with engineering properties suitable for service conditions. Wear replacement (WR) involves the repair of worn metal surfaces through the deposition of weld metal, and can also be performed using robotic GMAW. Since both rapid prototyping and wear replacement by robotic GMAW involve the building up of metal objects from metal deposited by the GMAW process, it is possible to combine research in this area. Rapid prototyping and wear replacement using the robotic GMAW process may however give rise to stability problems. <b>Geometric</b> and <b>thermal</b> instability can be an inherent feature of the process, resulting in relatively poor dimensional accuracy and surface quality. Various research directions have been taken in the past in order to address these problems, however the effects of weld path design on process stability have not yet been well researched. The objective of this thesis was to study what effects weld path design can have on the stability of rapid prototyping and wear replacement by GMAW, in order to test whether weld path design could be used to improve process stability and performance. The hypothesis adopted in this thesis was that improved <b>geometric</b> and <b>thermal</b> stability should be possible if the material and heat input are optimised by control of the weld path through weld path design. It was found that the stability of the rapid prototyping and wear replacement by GMAW process is very sensitive to weld path design and that optimised open-loop weld path design can be used to greatly improve process stability and performance. A number of different mechanisms were identified through which the weld path design impacts on the stability and performance of the process and corresponding recommendations for weld path design were presented. The suitability of various weld path designs for different types of applications was assessed and the most optimal weld path designs for an expected wide range of applications were identified. By using one of the most recommended path strategies, rapid prototyping and wear replacement by GMAW systems can enjoy improved <b>geometric</b> and <b>thermal</b> stability and fewer problems with weld defects, through the choice of weld path. It was predicted that the most successful commercial rapid prototyping and wear replacement by robotic GMAW systems would utilise a flexible and multi-faceted approach, using a combination of technologies, in order to best address the various needs of the process as required for key areas of industrial application...|$|R
