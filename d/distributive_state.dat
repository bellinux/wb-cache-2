5000|$|Rentier state {{theory has}} been one of several {{advanced}} to explain the predominance of authoritarian regimes in the Middle East and the apparent lack of success of democracy in the region. While many states export resources or license their development by foreign parties, rentier states are characterized by the relative absence of revenue from domestic taxation, as their naturally occurring wealth precludes the need to extract income from their citizenry. According to Douglas Yates, the economic behavior of a rentier stateembodies a break in the work-reward causation ... rewards of income and wealth for the rentier do not come as the result of work but rather are the result of chance or situation.Hazem Beblawi and Giacomo Luciani have argued that this could create a “rentier mentality,” while political scientist Fareed Zakaria has posited that such states fail to develop politically because, in the absence of taxes, citizens have less incentive to place pressure on the government to become responsive to their needs. Instead, the government essentially 'bribes' the citizenry with extensive social welfare programs, becoming an allocation or <b>distributive</b> <b>state.</b> The budget, in effect, is little more than an expenditure programme.|$|E

40|$|The {{developmental}} {{state in}} South Africa {{has become a}} matter of great concern and urgency to all practitioners at the three spheres of government. The government has, since its inception in 1994, promoted economic growth and development through a variety of mechanisms, including policy implementation and the promulgation of legislation. In the local sphere of government provision has been made for national and provincial intervention to maintain the national standards of service delivery. However, since 2004 the protests, sometime violent, against the inability of municipalities to deliver their services have increased exponentially. This article argues that realising the developmental state cannot be considered without taking into account both the social origin of the concept as well as its bureaucratic content. The spate of violent confrontations between municipalities and communities led to renewed calls for an interventionist and <b>distributive</b> <b>state.</b> However, the balance between developmentalism, interventionism and democracy has to be maintained.

40|$|This thesis {{uses the}} {{political}} economy approach to examine the relative failure of federalism in post-military Nigeria from 1999 to 2009. Nigeria's federal system is shaped by the country's political economy, which predominantly revolves around oil rents. The central featu re of Nigeria's political economy is the convoluted intimacy between oil and the state. Since the oil boom of the earty 19705, oil {{has been at the}} heart of Nigeria's fiscal federalism and, by extension, has been central to the practice of federalism. All sectors of the Nigerian rentier state are dependent upon the oil sector and consequently upon the state. This brings to the fore the link beween Nigeria's oil and the country's practice of federalism. Nigeria, being a <b>distributive</b> <b>state,</b> oversees the distribution of oil rents in the country, and the desire to achieve an equitable distribution has often resulted in the adoption of several fiscal principles dictated by a combination of factors, yet the country's fiscal system has continuously defied political and economic logic. The main argument in this thesis is that the Nigerian rentier state's domination of the economy {{is at the heart of}} the ethno·regional socio·economic competition for a share of the national wealth, which is the source of the failure of federalism in Nigeria, particularly in the period immediately following the tennination of military rule in 1999. The inability of the Nigerian federal state to distribute Nigeria's oil wealth effectively has become the. main source of the country's fai lure as a federal state, although the coloniaJJegacy of the Nigerian Federation, the country's comptex ethnic diversity, oil resource abundance, ingrained corruption and decades of military rule, have also in combination contributed to this verdict. None of these individual facto rs can be completely ignored when we try to explain this failure,. ===b"e"cause they interact in a complicated fashion such that it is difficult to untangle them. The main conclusion in this thesis is that Nigeria's failure to ensure an equitable distribution of oil·generated revenue epitomises the failure of federalism in Nigeria. The Nigerian federal system is largely flawed and is in serious need of some bold political engineering. Our position in this thesis is that these deficiencies are rooted in the country's unbalanced domestic political economy, which promotes over. ctependency on oil and consequently a predatory leadership. A political restructuring of the oil-rich federation in ways that would grant the constituent units some real political and fi scal autonomy would be a useful reform that might ultimately provide a cure to the ai ling federal system.

Second, we note that in the perioperative literature, the goal-directed approach to resuscitation typically results in more conservative volume resuscitation, whereas in septic patients, the goal-directed approach results in greater volume administration, suggesting that the goal-directed approach potentially unmasks greater volume needs in patients in early sepsis as their physiology progresses into a more <b>distributive</b> and vasodilatory <b>state.</b> In contrast, intraoperative resuscitation may be reflective of a state that is more vasoconstrictive owing to a combination of different anesthetic agents, pharmacologic vasogenic agents, and intraoperative hypothermia.|$|R

The average net social wage is very close to zero even though during the last decade we observe an increasing involvement of the state in the reproduction of labour.

The duality between monads and comonads corresponds, in general, to a symmetry between construction and observation, for instance between raising an exception and looking up a state. Thanks to the properties of adjunction one may go one step further: the coKleisli-on-Kleisli category of a monad provides a kind of observation {{with respect to a}} given construction, while dually the Kleisli-on-coKleisli category of a comonad provides a kind of construction with respect to a given observation.

40|$|Abstract. A finite algebra of finite type (i. e., {{having just}} finitely many {{fundamental}} operations) is finitely based if the variety it generates can be axiomatized by just finitely many equations. The finite basis problem asks for an explicit {{characterization of the}} finite algebras of finite type which are finitely based. This is a ridiculously impossible problem, but an intriguing subproblem is the task of proving a conjecture of R. Park from 1976. Park’s conjecture, motivated by K. Baker’s celebrated finite basis theorem (for finite algebras in congruence <b>distributive</b> varieties) <b>states</b> that if a finite algebra of finite type generates a variety in which all subdirectly irreducible members are finite and of bounded size, then the algebra is finitely based. In this lecture I survey {{the current state of}} knowledge of Park’s conjecture and related problems, and describe an extension of Baker’s theorem I wish I could prove. 1. Finitely Based Algebras A finite algebra of finite type is a structure A = 〈A; f 1, f 2, [...] ., fn〉 where A is finite nonempty set and each fi is a finitary operation on A, i. e., a function fi: A ni → A for a suitable nonnegative integer ni. An identity of A is a formal equation s ≈ t where each of s, t is an expression or word, built from variables and symbols representing the operations f 1, [...] ., fn, which is identically true in A under all possible assignments of values in A to the variables occurring in s or t. A is said to be finitely based if there exists a finite list of identities of A from which all the identities of A can be formally deduced. That is the definition. A more useful characterization is the following. We consider arbitrary algebras B = 〈B; g 1, [...] ., gn 〉 of the same “type ” as A, i. e., whose operations g 1, [...] ., gn are the same in number as those of A and take the same number of arguments as their counterparts in A.
