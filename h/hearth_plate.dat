40|$|The {{authors have}} {{continually}} {{stressed that the}} two most critical material parameters {{for the success of}} the rotary furnace are the <b>hearth</b> <b>plate</b> and the molding release powder. Both of these issues have been solidly addressed in this quarter. They have tested the three best candidates for <b>hearth</b> <b>plate</b> material this quarter. Although they had to use the in-house gas furnaces for the testing, one of the materials combines the best heating efficiency with the least sticking tendency. This material will be used for the electric prototype. The molding release powder is mainly used for preventing the glass from adhering to the <b>hearth</b> <b>plate</b> while the glass is softening for pressing. They recently visited several companies in Japan who also repress glass. The release agent that they use is Boron Nitride. They have identified a supplier within New York state, but their concern is the very high price of this material. They are bringing in samples of different grades for experimentation, but the focus continues to be to eliminate the need for any powder. An additional area for material testing was addressed during this quarter. Once the glass is in the tool (mold) for pressing, the glass has the potential to adhere to the metal that the tool and die are made from (usually steel). Both the powder and a spraying of a carbon product are currently used to reduce this problem. Alternate materials for the tooling and/or surface coatings of the steel need to be identified and tested. During this quarter, they conducted some off-site test runs on two candidate coating materials: platinum and titanium...|$|E
40|$|The project {{objectives}} were: elimination/reduction {{of the use}} of mold release powder; improvement of temperature control and data acquisition; improve operator working conditions; and maximize energy efficiency. Electric rotary furnace prototype has been built and will be on-site by the end of September. Additional space has been leased to insure a clean environment for testing. Preliminary data for candidate <b>hearth</b> <b>plate</b> material supports the hypothesis that wetting of the glass may be controlled by temperature and surface chemistry. This report describes materials testing, prototype development, testing protocols and methods, and technical milestones...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of studies on the development of manufacturing technologies to cast <b>hearth</b> <b>plates</b> operating in chamber furnaces for heat treatment. Castings made from the heat-resistant G-X 40 CrNiSi 27 - 4 steel were poured in hand-made green sand molds. The following operations were performed: computer simulation to predict the distribution of internal defects in castings produced by the above mentioned technology with risers bare and coated with exothermic and insulating sleeves, analysis of each variant of the technology, and manufacture of experimental castings. As a result of the conducted studies and analysis {{it was found that the}} use of risers with exothermic sleeves does not affect to a significant degree the quality of the produced castings of <b>hearth</b> <b>plates,</b> but it significantly improves the metal yield...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of studies on the application of ceramic filters in the manufacture of cast <b>hearth</b> <b>plates</b> at the WestPomeranian University of Technology in Szczecin. Castings were poured from the heat-resistant G-X 40 CrNiSi 27 - 4 cast steel in greensand moulds. The development of casting manufacturing technology included the following studies: analysis of the causes of nonmetallicinclusions in high-chromium alloys, computer simulation of mould filling with liquid metal using standard gating systems without filters and new systems with the built-in filter, making pilot castings, quantitative determination of the content of non-metallicinclusions, determination of the oxygen and nitrogen content, and evaluation of the extent of occurrence of the raw casting s urfacedefects. As a result of the conducted studies and analyses, the quality of produced castings was improved, mainly through the reducedcontent of non-metallic inclusions and better raw casting surface quality...|$|R
40|$|To {{commemorate the}} Dutch Revolt people {{from both the}} Northern and Southern Netherlands commissioned, kept, and {{collected}} a large variety of objects. From paintings to clay pipes, from <b>hearth</b> <b>plates</b> to gable stones, from clothing to cannonballs; all these objects were used to either remember of forget {{the war in the}} late sixteenth and seventeenth century. Especially on an urban level many of these material memories survive. They are part of an urban memory landscape, a set of shared memories which survived on several levels of the urban community and involved multiple stakeholders such as the magistrate, the church, corporations, and individual citizens. Within the urban community these stakeholders used diverse objects to promulgate a certain message about the Revolt. Subsequently this could become part of a city's urban identity and civic representation. Whether in the Dutch Republic or in the Habsburg Netherlands cities were well aware of their options either to include, exclude or reinterpret stories about the past. Material memories of the Dutch Revolt were therefore continuously and carefully (re) selected and used to reflect on what the urban community had gone through during eighty years of wa...|$|R
50|$|The lion’s head {{refers to}} Strohn’s former {{status as a}} Springiersbach Abbey holding. The lion was a common charge in arms borne by abbots. Lions may still {{be seen in the}} {{sandstone}} coat of arms on a house in the outlying centre of Sprink, which was also a monasterial landholding, and on the <b>hearth</b> heating <b>plate</b> in the same house. The millstone and ears of wheat refer to Strohn’s mills, of which one is still working today. The three ears also refer to agriculture, which is still important in the municipality. The balances are meant to stand for the high court at Strohn, belonging within whose jurisdiction were not only Strohn, but also Mückeln and Oberscheidweiler as well as the estates of Sprink and Trautzberg. The tinctures gules and argent (red and silver) stand for the Electorate of Trier; Strohn for centuries belonged to the Electoral-Trier Amt of Daun. The tincture vert (green) in the two upper divisions was chosen to stand for the “Strohn Switzerland” (Strohner Schweiz) - the Strohner Märchen and its scenic charm.|$|R
