5|$|Although {{nothing is}} {{happening}} <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>image,</b> we associate the figures with tragedy, with death and mourning – with the classical reference in the painting's title. Iphigenia, Agamemnon's daughter, gave {{her life for}} her country when the goddess Artemis asked for it in exchange for favourable winds so that the Greek ships could sail to Troy. Bellette's melancholic painting might be supposed to portray Iphigenia's friends mourning her death.|$|E
5|$|The {{other two}} stories, those of David and Judith, were often linked in Renaissance art, {{particularly}} by Florentine artists as they demonstrated {{the overthrow of}} tyrants, a popular subject in the Republic. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>image,</b> the shepherd boy, David, has brought down the towering Goliath with his sling, but the giant is alive {{and is trying to}} rise as David forces his head down to chop it off.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{image of}} a musical ensemble is found on the 8th century Borobudur temple, Central Java. Musical instruments such as the bamboo flute, bells, drums in various sizes, lute, and bowed and plucked string instruments were identified <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>image.</b> However it lacks metallophones and xylophones. Nevertheless, the image of this musical ensemble is suggested to be the ancient form of the gamelan.|$|E
25|$|In 1906, Sorolla and {{his family}} visited Biarritz in {{northern}} Spain. In the group portrait Paseo de Faro several women walk along the cliffs above the beach. The painter shows here the beach and washed around by underwater rock formation as a background motive. In front of the frieze-like image the women are loosely arranged side by side. Again, white clothing dominates the scene, and only the young girl in the center stands out in a bright red jacket.

500|$|The {{dead man}} in plate 37, Esto es peor (This is worse), forms a {{mutilated}} {{body of a}} Spanish fighter spiked on a tree, surrounded by the corpses of French soldiers. It is {{based in part on}} the Hellenistic fragment of a male nude, the Belvedere Torso by the Athenian [...] "Apollonios son of Nestor". Goya had earlier made a black wash drawing study of the statue during a visit to Rome. In Esto es peor he subverts the classical motifs used in war art through his addition of a degree of black theatre– the branch piercing the body through the anus, twisted neck and close framing. The man is naked; a daring factor for Spanish art in the 19th century, {{during the time of the}} Spanish Inquisition. Art critic Robert Hughes remarked that the figures <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>image</b> [...] "remind us that, if only they had been marble and the work of their destruction had been done by time rather than sabres, neo-classicists like Menges would have been in aesthetic raptures over them." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Vienna 2554 {{frontispiece}} {{is famous}} and {{has often been}} reproduced. This frontispiece shows God`s figure bent while {{in the work of}} creation. “There is no close iconographic antecedent for this image.” <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>image</b> God is utilizing a huge pair of compasses, which are carefully balanced so as to draw and define. God’s left hand seems to be in the process of putting the disk that is the cosmos into motion. In a broadly read study of Gothic architecture by Otto Von Simpson, this image is titled “The Creator as Architect,” this theme has been important from Plato and onward. Yet the meaning of this frontispiece has been widely debated. [...] Vienna 1179 also has a full page creator image. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>image</b> God is seated on a backless throne and he is holding the orb of the universe in his lap. With his right hand he turns the compasses. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>image</b> he is enclosed within a rectangular frame by a mandorla supported at the corners by four flying angels. [...] This idea of god as a creator, with images of god holding compasses has been reproduced in several of the Bibles moralisées and many debates have surrounded the meaning and origin of this idea.|$|E

The hole is [...] deep, exposing fresh interior material of the rock for close inspection with the rover's microscopic imager and two spectrometers on the robotic arm. This image was taken by Spirits panoramic camera, providing a quick visual check {{of the success of the}} grinding.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{reason is}} that some {{characters}} exist only in oracle bone script, dropping out of later usage (usually being replaced in their duties by other, newer characters). In such cases, context—when available—may {{be used to determine}} the possible meaning of the character. One good example is shown in the fragment below, labeled [...] "oracle bone script for Spring". The top left character <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>image</b> has no known modern Chinese counterpart. One of the better known characters, however, is shown directly beneath it looking like an upright isosceles triangle with a line cutting through the upper portion. This [...] is the oracle bone script character for 王 wáng ("king").|$|E
2500|$|In his letters, Paul also {{focuses on}} mental activities, {{but not in}} the same way as the Synoptics, which equate {{renewing}} the mind with repentance. Instead, Paul sees the renewal of our minds as happening as we contemplate what Jesus did on the Cross, which then opens us to grace and to the movement of the Holy Spirit into our hearts. Like John, Paul is less interested in knowledge, preferring to emphasize the hiddenness, the [...] "mystery" [...] of God's plan as revealed through Christ. But Paul's discussion of the Cross differs from John's in being less about how it reveals God's glory and more about how it becomes the stumbling block that turns our minds back to God. Paul also describes the Christian life as that of an athlete, demanding practice and training for the sake of the prize; later writers will see <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>image</b> a call to ascetical practices.|$|E
2500|$|The latter theme {{lies behind}} the 1572 The Family of Henry VIII: An Allegory of the Tudor Succession (attributed to Lucas de Heere). [...] <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>image,</b> Catholic Mary {{and her husband}} Philip II of Spain are {{accompanied}} by Mars the god of War on the left, while Protestant Elizabeth on the right ushers in the goddesses Peace and Plenty. An inscription states that this painting {{was a gift from}} the queen to Francis Walsingham as a [...] "Mark of her people's and her own content" [...] and this may indicate that it commemorates the signing of the Treaty of Blois (1572) which established an alliance between England and France against Spanish aggression in the Netherlands during Walsingham's tour of duty as ambassador to the French court. [...] Strong identifies both paintings as celebrations of Elizabeth's just rule by Flemish exiles to whom England was a refuge from the religious persecution of Protestants in the Spanish Netherlands.|$|E

2500|$|The Ditchley Portrait {{seems to}} have always been at Lee's home in Oxfordshire, and was likely painted for (or commemorates) her two-day visit to Ditchley in 1592. [...] <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>image,</b> the queen stands on a map of England, her feet on Oxfordshire.

2500|$|Unlike {{the other}} Buddhas, Dainichi Nyorai is {{typically}} {{depicted in the}} form of a boddhisattva, with the garments, adornments, and long hair of the nobility of ancient India. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>image</b> Dainichi is bare-chested, with flowing draperies hanging from the left shoulder; the head is crowned, the arms, wrists, neck, chest, and legs bejewelled; the topknot is high, with long hair resting on the right shoulder. Dainichi Nyorai appears in two principal guises as denoted by the mudrā or ritual gesture formed by the hands, that of the Diamond Realm and that of the Womb Realm. Here the mudrā is that of the [...] "knowledge fist" [...] of the Diamond Realm, with the fingers of the right hand symbolizing the five elements penetrated by the Buddhist essence as represented by the index finger of the left hand. The gesture also symbolizes the mystic union of the material with the spiritual of yoga practice, which in Tibet and Nepal takes the form of the ecstatic Yab-Yum embrace, but in China and Japan is sublimated in this mudrā.|$|E
