5000|$|A piped {{waterworks}} {{was built}} to serve downtown in 1876, and the initial system was complete by June 22, 1877. However, water was unavailable {{in parts of the}} city, notably The Avenues, then called [...] "the dry bench" [...] because water had to be carried uphill from City Creek below. In 1878 Avenues residents petitioned the city to tax property to expand the water system, and the territorial legislature authorized the levy. A diversion to the <b>dry</b> <b>bench</b> was made in 1884, piping water to residents on 6th avenue and below. Subsequent diversions fed higher parts of the city, {{but it was not until}} 1910 that a diversion was constructed high enough to provide water to the whole city.|$|R
40|$|Unfocused/weakly focused {{pressure}} pulses (UPP) are generated by an air-gun like mechanism, with a pro-jectile accelerated by pressurized air and impinging {{on a metal}} applicator. They were introduced in 1998 {{for the treatment of}} orthopedic soft tissue pain. The patient side of the applicator (a circular piston of 630 mm diam-eter) releases single pressure pulses of 210 MPa and 45 µs duration. Up today, there is no standard for the measurement of UPP sources (UPPS), so data are often reported {{on the basis of the}} focused lithotripter standard IEC 61846. The purpose of this research is to establish methods to reliably measure UPPS acoustic parameters and establish a parameter set based on definitions from focused lithotripsy sources as applicable. Therefore, acoustic characteristics and wave fields of the pressure pulses of UPPS from different manufacturers were measured in a water bath and in a <b>dry</b> test <b>bench.</b> It was demonstrated by comparison with optical hydrophones that piezo-electric hydrophones are appropriate for the measurements of UPP. For on-axis measurements at a fixed distance, measurements in the <b>dry</b> test <b>bench</b> can replace water-bath measurements. Additionally, the <b>dry</b> test <b>bench</b> allows for reliable results at pulse rates> 1 Hz...|$|R
40|$|Areas {{supporting}} Oregon White Oak {{are among}} the warmest and most arid sites supporting trees at {{the western edge of}} the Columbia Plateau. Most stands occur below 2000 feet in elevation but range between 1700 and 3000 feet. Sites supporting this type range from steep, lower slopes to more moderate slopes on <b>dry</b> <b>benches.</b> The more mesic sites are river and stream terraces where this deciduous tree and more mesic shrub species (common snowberry, rose, bittercherry, and California hazel) represent vegetation seral to ponderosa pine or Douglas-fir forest. Precipitation is generally less than 20 inches annually. The substrates are usually very gravelly, stony coarse loams derived from basalt colluvium in the uplands while alluvial material, including basalt, is the primary regolith along rivers and streams.

40|$|Abstract Background Various insect {{species have}} been added to genomic {{databases}} over the years. Thus, researchers can easily obtain online genomic information on invertebrates and insects. However, many incorrectly annotated genes are included in these databases, which can prevent the correct interpretation of subsequent functional analyses. To address this problem, we used a combination of <b>dry</b> and wet <b>bench</b> processes to select functional genes from public databases. Results Enolase is an important glycolytic enzyme in all organisms. We used a combination of <b>dry</b> and wet <b>bench</b> processes to identify functional enolases in the silkworm Bombyx mori (BmEno). First, we detected five annotated enolases from public databases using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) search, and then through cDNA cloning, Northern blotting, and RNA-seq analysis, we revealed three functional enolases in B. mori : BmEno 1, BmEno 2, and BmEnoC. BmEno 1 contained a conserved key amino acid residue for metal binding and substrate binding in other species. However, BmEno 2 and BmEnoC showed a change in this key amino acid. Phylogenetic analysis showed that BmEno 2 and BmEnoC were distinct from BmEno 1 and other enolases, and were distributed only in lepidopteran clusters. BmEno 1 was expressed in all of the tissues used in our study. In contrast, BmEno 2 was mainly expressed in the testis with some expression in the ovary and suboesophageal ganglion. BmEnoC was weakly expressed in the testis. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that the mRNA expression of BmEno 2 and BmEnoC correlated with testis development; thus, BmEno 2 and BmEnoC may be related to lepidopteran-specific spermiogenesis. Conclusions We identified and characterized three functional enolases from public databases with a combination of <b>dry</b> and wet <b>bench</b> processes in the silkworm B. mori. In addition, we determined that BmEno 2 and BmEnoC had species-specific functions. Our strategy could be helpful for the detection of minor genes and functional genes in non-model organisms from public databases...|$|R

40|$|Drying {{kinetics}} {{of three}} popcorn varieties (Pin, Deep and Light yellow) was investigated. The popcorn kernels initially conditioned to 25 % moisture content were <b>dried</b> in a <b>bench</b> scale rotary <b>drier</b> to 14 % moisture content at various air flow rates (0. 83, 1. 397, 2. 79 m/s) and temperatures (50 oC, 60 oC, 70 oC and 80 oC). Falling rate drying period was observed {{for the three}} popcorn varieties with Pin popcorn having the highest drying rate. Eight drying models {{were used to determine}} the thin layer drying kinetics. The Page equation, Two term model, Modified Page were found the best to describe the thin layer drying of Pin, Light yellow and Deep yellow popcorn, but the newly proposed model serve as a general model which best describe the drying kinetics of all the three popcorn varieties, with high correlation coefficient. The drying behaviour of the three kernels was found to be largely dependent on changes in temperature and air velocit...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} the design, optimization, {{and control of}} a coupled cylindrical floater and permanent magnet linear generator for wave-energy conversion. The investigation begins {{with the construction of}} the time-domain equation of motion for a generic floating body. The construction of a physical cylindrical floater is followed by a description of the experiments completed to verify free-motion and wave-exciting force predictions. The time-domain equation of motion was compared against experiments where it was found that corrective terms needed to be added due to the presence of viscosity. Initial low motion amplitudes lead to evaluation of the hydrodynamic performance between a floater with a flat and rounded-hemispherical bottom. Experimental results demonstrated that motion amplitudes can be over predicted by a factor of 2 when neglecting the effects of viscosity. Second, modifications to the design, fabrication process, and material of a permanent magnet linear generator (PMLG) will be discussed with the aim of increasing both power output and mechanical-to-electrical conversion efficiency. In order to evaluate the performance of the power-take-off unit a dry-bench test was completed which consisted of driving the armature of the PMLG at various frequencies with a fixed motion amplitude. The force signature from the bench test was used to extract the spring, damping, and inertia force coefficients due to the influence of the PMLG. The force coefficients were obtained for various speeds, resistive loads, and magnet coil gap widths. The floater equation of motion was modified to accommodate the influence of the PMLG to predict the coupled system performance. As the damping coefficient was the dominant contribution to the PMLG reaction force, the optimum non time-varying damping values were presented for all frequencies, recovering the well known impedance matching at the coupled resonance frequency. Model-scale tests of the coupled floater-generator system were performed at the UC-Berkeley Model Testing Facility to verify the optimum conditions for energy extraction. In an effort to further maximize power absorption, nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) was applied to the model-scale point absorber. The NMPC strategy was set up as a nonlinear optimization problem utilizing the Interior Point OPTimizer (IPOPT) package to obtain the optimal time-varying generator damping from the PMLG. This was accompanied by a latching damper that was allowed to periodically slow the floater velocity in an effort to increase power absorption. The emphasis on this work has been on sub-optimal strategies that limit the power-take-off unit to behave as a generator, thereby minimizing energy return to the waves. It was found that the ideal NMPC strategy required a PTO unit that could be turned on and off instantaneously, leading to sequences where the generator would be inactive for up to 60 % of the wave period. Experimental validation of the NMPC included repeating the <b>dry</b> <b>bench</b> test in order to characterize the time-varying performance of the PMLG. This was achieved through the use of mechanical relays to control when the electromagnetic conversion process would be active. After the time-varying performance of the PMLG was characterized the experimental set-up was transferred to the wave tank. The on/off sequencing of the PMLG was tested under regular and irregular wave excitation to validate NMPC simulations using the control inputs obtained from running the controller offline. Experimental results indicate that successful implementation was achieved and the absorbed power was indeed maximized...|$|R
40|$|It is {{not well}} {{understood}} what determines the degree of supercooling of apoplastic sap in trees, although it determines the number and duration of annual freeze–thaw cycles in a given environment. We studied the linkage between apoplastic ice nucleation temperature, tree water status, and conduit size. We used branches of 10 gymnosperms and 16 angiosperms collected from an arboretum in Helsinki (Finland) in winter and spring. Branches with lower relative water content froze at lower temperatures, and branch water content was lower in winter than in spring. A <b>bench</b> <b>drying</b> experiment with Picea abies confirmed that decreasing branch water potential decreases apoplastic ice nucleation temperature. The studied angiosperms froze on average 2. 0 and 1. 8 °C closer to zero Celsius than the studied gymnosperms during winter and spring, respectively. This was caused by higher relative water content in angiosperms; when branches were saturated with water, apoplastic ice nucleation temperature of gymnosperms increased to slightly higher temperature than that of angiosperms. Apoplastic ice nucleation temperature in sampled branches {{was positively correlated with}} xylem conduit diameter as shown before, but saturating the branches removed the correlation. Decrease in ice nucleation temperature decreased the duration of freezing, which could have an effect on winter embolism formation via the time available for gas escape during ice propagation. The apoplastic ice nucleation temperature varied not only between branches but also within a branch between consecutive freeze–thaw cycles demonstrating the stochastic nature of ice nucleation...|$|R

Compressed air was passed through glass, plant-containing cuvettes, ethylene collected on chilled columns, and subsequently assayed by gas chromatography. The usual {{result was that}} low water potential did not promote ethylene production. When plants were subjected to cessation of irrigation, ethylene production decreased on a per plant or dry weight basis of calculation. No significant promotion of ethylene production above control levels was detected when water deficit-treated bean or cotton plants were rewatered. The one exception to this was for cotton subjected {{to a range of}} water deficits, plants subjected to deficits of − 1. 4 to − 1. 6 MPa exhibited a transient increase of ethylene production of 40 to 50 % above control levels at 24 or 48 hours. Ethylene was collected from intact leaves while plants developed a water deficit stress of − 2. 9 megapascals after rewatering, and no significant promotion of ethylene production was detected. The shoots of fruited, flowering cotton plants produced less ethylene when subjected to cessation of irrigation. In contrast, the ability of <b>bench</b> <b>drying</b> of detached leaves to increase ethylene production several-fold was verified for both beans and cotton. The data indicate that detached leaves react differently to rapid drying than intact plants react to drying of the soil with regard to ethylene production. This result suggests the need for additional attention to ethylene as a complicating factor in experiments employing excised plant parts and the need to verify the relevance of shock stresses in model systems...|$|R

40|$|Erosion {{is a form}} of land {{degradation}} is very serious in Koloh Pasiran watershed. This condition perceived more severe {{by the fact that the}} understanding of the process of saving the natural resources of forest, soil and water have not received maximum attention. This is evidenced by the presence of illegal logging, forest fires around the area of the watershed during the dry season and flooding during every rainy season. Therefore, the research conducted with the aim to: 1) determine the level of erosion and soil and water conservation planning in the Koloh Pasiran watershed, 2) determine the land capability class in Koloh Pasiran watershed and 3) to plan land use capability classes based on erosion rate. Observations and sampling of soil samples for prediction of erosion, soil conservation and classification approach according, planning based on common land unit. This land unit maps obtained from the land use maps overlay by slope, soil and land use maps done by estimating the magnitude of the erosion equation USLE (Universal Soil Loss Equation) of Wischmeier and Smit (1978). Determine land capability class with land capability classification approach according Arsyad (1989). Land use planning and soil and water conservation in addition to using USLE equation also uses land capability classification according Arsyad (1989). The results show the level of erosion prediction calculation slight to very severe erosion. Mixture of garden soil with a 2 % slope erosion rates relatively slight. Dry land with a slope of 2 % classified as severe erosion and the shrub land with a slope of 2 - 3 % erosion classified as severe to very severe. While in secondary forest land and primary forests with a slope of 2 - 25 % relatively slight erosion. Land capability class in Koloh Pasiran watershed can be classified into class IV (3 units of land), class V (5 units of land), class VI (1 unit of land) and VIII (2 units of land).

40|$|The {{development}} of a novel and straightforward procedure for the preparation of matrix-matched calibration standards for the quantitative imaging of iron (Fe) in biological tissues by laser ablation (LA) -ICP-MS with on-tissue internal standard addition is described. This simple approach enabled on-tissue addition of Rh as internal standard to samples (with heterogeneous Fe distribution) and calibrants (with homogeneous Fe distribution). This is achieved without altering the original Fe distribution of the sample. Calibration standards were prepared by full horizontal immersion of slides with mounted homogenised sheep brain tissue section into the corresponding solution containing 0. 5, 0. 75, 1, 5, 10 and 20 mg kg(- 1) Fe (each also containing 250 mu g kg(- 1) Rh as IS) in pure methanol for 30 minutes (6 immersions, each for 5 minutes). Subsequent air-drying (<b>bench</b> <b>drying</b> at room temperature) for approximately 5 minutes was undertaken in between consecutive immersions, to prevent long-term exposure of the tissue to lipid degradation. Tissue-matched standards were characterised in-house for Fe composition, homogeneity and stability (at storage temperatures of - 80 degrees C, - 20 degrees C, 4 degrees C and 25 degrees C for up to 2 months) in order to investigate their suitability as calibrants for quantitative LA-ICP-MS. The homogeneity data suggested that the materials are homogeneous in terms of Fe and Rh distribution with RSDs (n = 30) of 8. 3 % and 4. 7 %, respectively. The Fe measurement precision was improved by approximately a factor of 2 when normalising Fe- 56 intensities to Rh- 103 intensities; the RSD (n = 30) for Fe- 56 /Rh- 103 was 3. 6 %. The produced calibration standards {{were found to be}} stable when stored at room temperature for approximately 50 days, suggesting that they can be reused for multiple batches. Using LA coupled to double-focusing sector field ICP-MS in medium resolution mode (m/Delta m = 4000), linear calibration over a range of 107 to 1519 mg kg(- 1) Fe (R- 2 = 0. 99) was achieved with a limit of detection of 1. 84 mg kg(- 1) Fe. Assessment of the accuracy of the method for the quantitative imaging of Fe in tissues was undertaken by comparison of the LA-ICP-MS data with that obtained by micro-XRF; the average Fe concentrations in selected tissue regions obtained by using XRF fell within the window defined by the LA-ICP-MS values and their associated standard deviations...|$|R
