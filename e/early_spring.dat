40|$|In the {{northern}} high latitudes, alternative hypotheses {{with regards to}} how warming-related shifts in seasonality influence ecosystem productivity exist. Increased plant growth associated with a longer growing season may enhance ecosystem productivity, but shifts to <b>earlier</b> <b>springs</b> may also negatively influence soil moisture status and productivity during {{the peak of the}} growing season. Here, we analyzed nearly three decades (1982 – 2008) of observational records and derived products, including satellite microwave and optical imagery as well as upscaled ecosystem flux observations, to better understand how shifts in seasonality impact hydrology and productivity in the North American boreal forests. We identified a dominant adverse influence of <b>earlier</b> <b>springs</b> on peak summer forest greenness, actual evapotranspiration and productivity at interannual time scales across the drier western and central sections of the North American boreal forests. In the vast regions where this spring onset mechanism operates, ecosystem productivity gains from <b>earlier</b> <b>springs</b> during the <b>early</b> portion of the growing season are effectively cancelled through corresponding losses in the later portion. Our results also indicate that recent decadal shifts towards <b>earlier</b> <b>springs</b> and associated drying {{in the midst of the}} growing season over western North American boreal forests may have contributed to the reported declines in summer productivity and increases in tree mortality and fire activity. With projections of accelerated northern high-latitude warming and associated shifts to <b>earlier</b> <b>springs,</b> persistent soil moisture deficits in peak summer may be an effective mechanism for regional-scale boreal forest dieback through their strong influence on productivity, tree mortality and disturbance dynamics...|$|R

40|$|The {{timing of}} phenological events exerts a strong control over {{ecosystem}} function {{and leads to}} multiple feedbacks to the climate system. Phenology is inherently sensitive to temperature (although the exact sensitivity is disputed) and recent warming {{is reported to have}} led to <b>earlier</b> <b>spring,</b> later autumn and increased vegetation activity. Such greening could be expected to enhance ecosystem carbon uptake, although reports also suggest decreased uptake for boreal forests. Here we assess changes in phenology of temperate forests over the eastern US during the past two decades, and quantify the resulting changes in forest carbon storage. We combine long-term ground observations of phenology, satellite indices, and ecosystem-scale carbon dioxide flux measurements, along with 18 terrestrial biosphere models. We observe a strong trend of <b>earlier</b> <b>spring</b> and later autumn. In contrast to previous suggestions we show that carbon uptake through photosynthesis increased considerably more than carbon release through respiration for both an <b>earlier</b> <b>spring</b> and later autumn. The terrestrial biosphere models tested misrepresent the temperature sensitivity of phenology, and thus the effect on carbon uptake. Our analysis of the temperature-phenology-carbon coupling suggests a current and possible future enhancement of forest carbon uptake due to changes in phenology. This constitutes a negative feedback to climate change, and is serving to slow the rate of warming. 7 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Research {{has shown}} that the snow season in the Northern Hemisphere has been getting shorter in recent decades, {{consistent}} with documented global temperature increases. Specifically, the snow is melting <b>earlier</b> in the <b>spring</b> allowing for a longer growing season and associated land-cover changes. Here we focus on North America. Using the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Radiometer (MODIS) cloud-gap-filled standard snow-cover data product we can detect a trend toward <b>earlier</b> <b>spring</b> snowmelt in the approx 12 years since the MODIS launch. However, not all areas in North America show <b>earlier</b> <b>spring</b> snowmelt over the study period. We show examples of springtime snowmelt over North America, beginning in March 2000 and extending through the winter of 2012 for all of North America, and for various specific areas such as the Wind River Range in Wyoming and in the Catskill Mountains in New York. We also compare our approx 12 -year trends with trends derived from the Rutgers Global Snow Lab snow cover climate-data record...|$|R
