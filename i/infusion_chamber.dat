40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{advanced}} adenocarcinoma of {{the pancreas}} treatment with 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) or ifosfamide results in response rates of approximately 20 %. Continuous infusion {{of these drugs}} is on many grounds theoretically attractive and may therefore offer advantages over bolus or short-term infusion. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas with progressive measurable disease and no previous chemotherapy entered the study. After implantation of a subcutaneous <b>infusion</b> <b>chamber</b> patients were treated on days 1 - 12 with ifosfamide (1. 0 g/m 2 /day) and 5 -FU (300 mg/m 2 /day) as a continuous intravenous infusion using a portable infusion pump. Mesna (1. 0 g/m 2 /day) was added as uroprotective agent from day 1 - 14. Courses were repeated every 4 weeks. RESULTS: Fifteen of the 16 patients were evaluable for response. One partial response was observed (response rate 7 % [95 % CI: 0 %- 32 %]). Toxicity occurred in 64 % of the courses. Dose limiting toxic effects were grade 3 nausea/vomiting (WHO) in 3 patients, grade 2 mucositis in 1 patient and grade 4 leukopenia in 1 patient. CONCLUSION: Intermittent continuous infusion with ifosfamide, mesna and 5 -FU is feasible on an outpatient basis. Although continuous infusion of ifosfamide may have a more favorable toxicity profile, the combination of 5 -FU and ifosfamide in this schedule is no more effective than bolus or short-term infusio...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{design a}} method to {{preserve}} enucleated porcine eyes {{for use in a}} wet laboratory. SETTING: Laboratory of Experimental Ophthalmology, University Medical Center Groningen, the Netherlands. DESIGN: Experimental study. METHODS: Porcine eyes were preserved using 15 methods including salt solutions, anterior <b>chamber</b> <b>infusion</b> fluids, tap water, mineral water, air, and topical glycerol on the cornea. The central corneal thickness (CCT) was measured by A-scan ultrasound over 3 days. Differences between increases in CCT were compared using repeated-measures multivariate analyses of variance. Also, lenses from eyes preserved in tap water were extracted and the lens epithelial cell morphology was studied. RESULTS: There was a significant interaction between the preservation method and CCT over 3 days (P CONCLUSIONS: Of the 15 tested methods to preserve porcine eyes, tap water (mineral content 1. 79 mmol/L) resulted in the least corneal swelling. It is not necessary to use more expensive anterior <b>chamber</b> <b>infusion</b> fluids or other salt solutions. (C) 2014 ASCRS and ESCR...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the causes of}} descemet membrane detachment, and put forward the treatment and prevention methods. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 30 cases(30 eyes) with decement membrane detachment was investigated. Gas tamponade in anterior chamber was performed, after 6 months of follow-up, the corneal transparency and visual acuity were observed. RESULTS: Cataract and glaucoma were common causes of decement membrane and detachment, 25 of the 30 cases had vision improved obviously after gas <b>infusion</b> in anterior <b>chamber,</b> 27 patients with recovery of corneal transparency. CONCLUSION: The decement membrane detachment has great effect on cornea, it should be promptly dealt with, otherwise it can easily cause corneal persistent injury...|$|R
40|$|Aim: We {{conducted}} {{this study}} to evaluate and compare corneal endothelial cell loss between phacoemulsification with continuous anterior <b>chamber</b> <b>infusion</b> using anterior <b>chamber</b> maintainer (ACM) and phacoemulsification using ophthalmic viscosurgical device (OVD). Materials and Methods: This was a prospective, randomized controlled trial. Fifty eyes of 47 patients of senile cataract undergoing phacoemulsification were included. Patients were randomly allocated into two groups of 25 eyes each. Cataract surgery was performed by phacoemulsification with anterior <b>chamber</b> (AC) continuous <b>infusion</b> with balanced salt solution (BSS) plus and ACM without OVD in Group A, and in Group B, phacoemulsification was performed using OVD with BSS plus. Corneal endothelial cell count and pachymetry were performed preoperatively and postoperatively on day 1, day 7, and day 30. Results: The mean increase in pachymetry was 4. 86 &#x 0025;, 2. 94 &#x 0025;, and 1. 94 &#x 0025;, (Group A) and 5. 95 &#x 0025;, 3. 94 &#x 0025;, and 0. 51 &#x 0025;, (Group B) on first, seventh, and 30 th postoperative day respectively. The difference between the percentage increase in pachymetry {{between the two groups}} was not significant at day 1 (P = 0. 441), day 7 (P = 0. 298), and day 30 (P = 0. 174) postoperatively. The density of endothelial cells decreased postoperatively (day 30) by 7. 38 &#x 0025; (Group A) and 7. 47 &#x 0025; (Group B) without any significant statistical difference (P = 0. 983) between two groups. Conclusion: Use of ACM for continuous AC infusion and omission of OVD during phacoemulsification did not cause significant difference in corneal swelling or endothelial cell loss in the immediate postoperative period up to one month...|$|R
5000|$|The lens bag {{in which}} the new {{artificial}} lens is kept may be damaged due to trauma, from birth or by surgery. During cataract surgery, when half {{or more of the}} lens is remaining and the operating surgeon notices capsule damage; the IOL scaffold technique 6 can be used to rescue the lens and prevent further complications. In this technique, the selected artificial lens or IOL is placed in the sulcus ( [...] remaining part of the lens bag) and phacoemulsification surgery using ultrasound is performed over it (Fig 1). Once the entire lens is removed {{on the surface of the}} IOL, the IOL is well positioned on the capsule remnant (sulcus). As soon as the surgeon notices the capsular tear or sinking nucleus, anterior <b>chamber</b> <b>infusion</b> can be used to stabilize the chamber. Anterior vitrectomy is performed to remove the vitreous in the pupil and anterior part of eye. Then the IOL which is already planned for placing in the lens bag is inserted under the nucleus on the remaining capsule bag. The nucleus is positioned on the IOL and the remaining surgery is completed.|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the neuroprotective effect of rho-associated coiled coil-forming protein kinase(ROCK) inhibitor y- 39983 on retinal ischemia reperfusion(IR) injury in rats. METHODS: Sixty adult SD rats {{were randomly assigned}} into normal group(n = 15), IR group(n = 15), saline group(n = 15), y- 39983 group(n = 15), and the rats in later three groups were induced retinal IR by intra-anterior <b>chamber</b> <b>infusion</b> of saline solution. Rats in the saline and y- 39983 groups were intravitreously injected with normal saline and y- 39983 respectively, 5 minutes prior to the induction of ischemia. The protein expression of intercellular cell adhesion molecules- 1 (ICAM- 1) was determined by immunohistochemical staining. Retrograde labeling of retinal ganalion cells(RGCs) with fluorogold was performed to assess the number of RGCs. Histologic studies and electroretinogram were carried out to evaluate retinal damage. RESULTS: The preadminisration of y- 39983 decreased ICAM- 1 expression, elevated the survival rate of RGCs and the recoverage rate of amplitude of b wave and O 2 wave significantly, and attenuated the IR-induced the thinning of inner retina. CONCLUSION: y- 39983 can protect the rat retina from IR injury at least partially by inhibiting ICAM- 1 abnormal expression, suggesting that y- 39983 may have therapeutic potential for the retinal diseases associated with IR...|$|R
40|$|AIM:To {{detect the}} {{protective}} effect of curcumin for retinal ganglion cells(RGCs) in adult rabbits with acute intraocular hypertension. METHODS: Twenty-four adult rabbits were divided randomly into normal control group, model group and curcumin group. Except normal control group, the rabbit model with acute ocular hypertension {{was established by}} increasing intraocular pressure through anterior <b>chamber</b> <b>infusion.</b> After {{the establishment of the}} model, rabbits in curcumin group were injected intravitreally with curcumin(0. 1 mg/ 0. 1 mL) for 7 d. Rabbits in mdodel group were injected with physiological saline replaced of the same volume curcumin. The oculars in normal control group without any treatments were acquired directly. The levels of Thy- 1 in RGCs were detected by immunohistochemistry. The density of RGCs was counted too. RESULTS: Thy- 1 expressed in the RGCs in normal control group and curcumin group had no significant difference(P > 0. 05). While the difference between model group and normal control group on Thy- 1 expression was statistically significant(P CONCLUSION: In this study on curcumin in adult rabbits with acute ocular hypertension, curcumin can increase the expression of Thy- 1, which shows that it can partly reduce the injury of RGCs in rabbits with acute intraocular hypertension and curcumin may be able to protect the retina under certain situation...|$|R
40|$|Psychostimulant-induced {{reinstatement}} {{of place}} preferences {{have been used}} to investigate underlying physiological mechanisms mediating drug-seeking behavior in adolescent and adult rodents; however, it is still unclear how psychostimulant exposure during adolescence affects neuronal communication in the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) pathway and whether these changes would elicit enhanced drug-seeking behavior later in adulthood. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the effects of intra-ventral tegmental area (VTA) or intra-nucleus accumbens septi (NAcc) DA D 2 receptor antagonist infusions on cocaine-induced reinstatement of cocaine place conditioning in high and low responders for cocaine reward. Adolescent rats were exposed to cocaine place conditioning [postnatal day (PND 28 - 39) ] and divided into high and low responders for cocaine reward based on their place preference expression score. Place preferences were extinguished and guide cannula were implanted into either the VTA or NAcc followed by one of the following: 1) intra-VTA or intra-NAcc infusion of the DA D 2 receptor antagonist sulpiride (100 µM) during a cocaine-primed reinstatement test (10 mg/kg/ip cocaine) or 2) measurement of NAcc DA levels during intra-VTA or intra-NAcc infusion of sulpiride (100 µM), a cocaine prime (10 mg/kg cocaine) and re-exposure to the cocaine paired <b>chamber.</b> <b>Infusion</b> of sulpiride into the VTA but not the NAcc blocked reinstatement of cocaine place conditioning in rats exposed to cocaine during adolescence. Furthermore, re-exposure to cocaine-associated cues and simultaneous local infusion of sulpiride into either the VTA or NAcc attenuated cocaine-induced increases in accumbal DA levels for rats pretreated with cocaine during adolescence, regardless of phenotype. These data suggest intrinsic compensatory mechanisms in the mesolimbic DA pathway mediate adolescent behavioral responsivity to cocaine prime-induced reinstatement of cocaine place conditioning later on in adulthood...|$|R
5000|$|The Brandenburg gassing, {{together}} with the gassings of Polish mental patients that the SS-Sonderkommando had {{carried out in the}} autumn 1939 gas chamber in Fort VII at Posen, led to the specification that the T4 victims should also be killed with CO gas. Becker was assigned to instruct the physicians, who were to set up six [...] "institutes" [...] for gassing, the first of which was at Grafeneck. According to Becker's later testimony, around the end of January 1940 he brought the gas bottles out from Brandenburg to Grafeneck Castle, to put the institute there [...] "into operation", that is, to start the killing program there. Originally, a Dr. Schumann was to operate the CO valve, but Schumann let the gas flow too quickly, causing it to hiss loudly inside the [...] "shower room." [...] This caused the victims, whom Becker called, even years later, the [...] "delinquents" [...] to become agitated. Becker took over manometers from Schumann. He slowed down the gas <b>infusion</b> into the <b>chamber,</b> which caused the victims to calm down and die shortly thereafter.Up to the end of Action T4 in August 1941 Becker's job was to arrange delivery of CO bottles from the I.G. Farben plant in Ludwigshafen to the killing facilities. The purchase orders for the gas were made by Albert Widmann of the Criminal Technology Institute (Kriminaltechnische Institut) or (KTI), of the Central National Security Office (RSHA). Like Becker, Widman was also tried in a German court after the war. In Widman's case, the court, based in Stuttgart found that Widman's role was to order the CO gas bottles to conceal the fact that the purchase orders were coming from a party agency, and in particular, from the Führer Chancellery. This was decided upon by Becker and Widman's superior, Victor Brack, at the Führer Chancellery, but it had been previously suggested by Arthur Nebe. Widmann received from the individual killing institutes their CO demand. He then ordered the CO gas bottles from the Baden Aniline and Soda Works in Ludwigshafen orders, giving KTI as the purchaser. Widman then sent the order and supply confirmations to Becker, who was working at the Führer Chancellery arranging for their delivery to the individual institutes.|$|R
