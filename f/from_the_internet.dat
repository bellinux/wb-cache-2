5|$|In March 2012, the parody {{national}} anthem from the film's soundtrack, which acclaims Kazakhstan for its high-quality potassium exports {{and having the}} second cleanest prostitutes in the region, was mistakenly played at the Amir of Kuwait International Shooting Grand Prix.

5|$|The {{landline}} telephones in most residential {{homes are}} analog—that is, the speaker's voice directly determines the signal's voltage. Although short-distance calls may be handled from end-to-end as analog signals, increasingly telephone service providers are transparently converting the signals to digital signals for transmission. The {{advantage of this}} is that digitized voice data can travel side-by-side with data <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> and can be perfectly reproduced in long distance communication (as opposed to analog signals that are inevitably impacted by noise).|$|E

5|$|In the United Kingdom, {{access to}} illegal content (such as child pornography) was {{strictly}} self-regulated by individual internet service providers. This began when BT Group introduced Cleanfeed, a server-side filtering system which uses data obtained <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> Watch Foundation. The IWF is a Quango organisation that operates a website where users can report web pages containing illegal or dubious {{content to be}} added to their blacklists. This was implemented in order to prevent users from accessing this material, since it is illegal to possess an indecent image of a child under the age of 18 per the Protection of Children Act. British ISPs were later obligated by the government to implement filters for illegal content by the beginning of 2007.|$|E

Two deluxe editions were released by Tee Pee Records: both came with the code for the Internet download, and one came with an exclusive T-shirt as well.|$|E

All the footage and pictures in the game were taken <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>internet.</b> Final Fantasy VI influenced the sprite-based design. Many of the songs in the game are MIDI versions of 1990s grunge and alternative bands such as Radiohead, Nirvana and the Smashing Pumpkins. Ledonne paid meticulous attention to detail, including giving players access to the exact inventory the gunmen used on their rampage. He watched videos, read newspaper articles and pored over 11,000 pages of documents released by the county government regarding the massacre and the killers.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the mid-1980s, early '90s and 2000s, {{a number}} of black music pirate {{stations}} in London, including Vibes FM, Power Jam FM (now deceased), Lightening FM, Juice FM (now deceased), Roots FM, Sweet FM (now deceased), RJR FM, Millennium Supreme FM, Baseline FM (now deceased), Blues FM, Galaxy FM, Unique FM, Genesis FM, On top FM, SLR (South London Radio) FM, Time FM (now deceased),Kool FM, Conscious FM and Station FM have established a relatively stable presence on the airwaves. With the advent of internet radio, these stations, particularly Genesis FM have acquired a global audience, while still retaining their local flavor. One of the station managers from Genesis FM said: Our Sunday show gets 2,000 listeners <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>internet</b> alone so the radio {{can be an effective}} way of getting a message across.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Internet and {{international}} telephone service in Ürümqi remained limited {{for nearly a}} year after the riots. As late as November, most of the Internet was still inaccessible to residents and international phone calls were impossible; as late as December, most web content hosted outside the autonomous region remained off-limits to all but a few journalists, and residents had to travel to Dunhuang 14 hours away to access the Internet normally. Within the city, only about 100 local sites, such as banks and regional government websites, could be accessed. Both incoming and outgoing international phone calls were disallowed, so Ürümqi residents could only communicate by calling intermediaries in other cities in China who would then place the international calls. The communications blackout generated controversy even within China: Yu Xiaofeng of Zhejiang University criticised the move, and many Ürümqi locals said it hurt businesses and delayed recovery, whereas David Gosset of the Euro-China forum argued that the government had the right to shut down communications for the sake of social stability; some locals believed that getting away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Internet</b> even improved their quality of life.|$|E
