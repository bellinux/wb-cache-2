5|$|In 1944, the United States Bureau of Reclamation chief design engineer, John L. Savage, {{surveyed}} {{the area and}} drew up a dam proposal for the 'Yangtze River Project'. Some 54 Chinese engineers went to the U.S. for training. The original plans called for the dam to employ a unique method for moving ships; the ships would move into locks located at the lower and upper ends of the dam and then cranes with cables would move the ships from one lock to the next. In the case of smaller water craft, groups of craft would be lifted together for efficiency. It is not known whether this solution was considered for its water-saving performance or because the engineers thought the difference in height between the river {{above and below the}} dam too great for alternative methods. Some exploration, survey, <b>economic</b> <b>study,</b> and design work was done, but the government, {{in the midst of the}} Chinese Civil War, halted work in 1947.|$|E

25|$|A new <b>economic</b> <b>study</b> of {{the health}} impacts and {{associated}} costs of air pollution in the Los Angeles Basin and San Joaquin Valley of Southern California shows that more than 3,800 people die prematurely (approximately 14 years earlier than normal) each year because air pollution levels violate federal standards. The number of annual premature deaths is considerably higher than the fatalities related to auto collisions in the same area, which average fewer than 2,000 per year.|$|E
25|$|According to a United States Department of the Treasury nonpartisan <b>economic</b> <b>study,</b> {{the major}} tax bills enacted under Reagan caused federal revenue to fall by an amount equal to roughly 1% of GDP.

In fewer than eight years, the U.S. went from being the world's largest creditor nation to the world's largest debtor nation.|$|E

25|$|As Germany {{scheduled}} its {{invasion of}} Poland for August 25 {{and prepared for}} war with France, German war planners in August estimated that, because of massive oil, food and rubber shortfalls, {{in the face of}} an expected British blockade, the Soviet Union would become the only supplier for many items. Every internal German military and <b>economic</b> <b>study</b> had argued that Germany was doomed to defeat without at least Soviet neutrality. By August 10, the countries worked out the last minor technical details, but the Soviets delayed signing the economic agreement for almost ten days until they were sure that they had also reached a political agreement.|$|E
