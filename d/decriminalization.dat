5|$|Later in {{the debate}} Dodd {{articulated}} {{his support for the}} <b>decriminalization</b> of marijuana citing the high populations of American prisons. Many of the participants expressed their disagreement with him on this issue. The debate was the last campaign stop for Dodd in October who went into November with energy and momentum from the multiple exchanges.|$|E
5|$|The Ron Paul presidential {{campaign}} of 1988 began in early 1987 when former Congressman Ron Paul of Texas announced his candidacy for the 1988 presidential nomination of the Libertarian Party. He joined the third party {{after leaving the}} Republican Party over the Reagan administration's handling of the federal budget. He ran on a platform that included non-interventionism in foreign conflicts, <b>decriminalization</b> of illegal drugs on a federal level, {{a return to the}} gold standard, the abolition of the Federal Reserve and a reduction in all government spending.|$|E
5|$|Ann Arbor has a {{long history}} of {{openness}} to marijuana, given Ann Arbor's <b>decriminalization</b> of cannabis, the large number of medical marijuana dispensaries in the city (one dispensary, called People's Co-op, was directly across the street from Michigan Stadium until zoning forced it to move one mile to the west), the large number of pro-marijuana residents, and the annual Hash Bash: an event that is held on the first Saturday of April. Until (at least) the successful passage of Michigan's medical marijuana law, the event had arguably strayed from its initial intent, although for years, a number of attendees have received serious legal responses due to marijuana use on University of Michigan property, which does not fall under the city's progressive and compassionate ticketing program.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, nearly 20,000 people {{attended}} the third annual Hempstalk Festival at Sellwood Riverfront Park in Portland, Oregon. While organizers insisted smoking {{would not be}} tolerated, the smell of marijuana lingered {{in the air and}} some festival goers chose to consume various forms of cannabis foods. No festival attendees were arrested. Seattle Hempfest is an annual event in Seattle, Washington also attended by Oregonians, known as the world's largest annual gathering advocating <b>decriminalization</b> of marijuana for uses including but not limited to medicinal, industrial, and recreational. The 2008 Seattle Hempfest, which took place August 1617, set a new record with around 150,000 people in attendance.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} generally supports progressive causes such as {{the extensive}} city recycling programs and the <b>decriminalization</b> of cannabis both for medical and recreational use at the municipal level (though the scope of latter of the two cannabis ordinances has since been restricted). The city {{is also one of}} only four in the state to offer medical benefits to same-sex partners of city employees. The new health plan also extends health benefits to unmarried heterosexual domestic partners of city employees. On October 10, 2006, the City Council approved an ordinance to prohibit smoking in public places, including restaurants and bars. The ordinance was passed with protest, and several amendments to the ordinance reflect this. Over half of citizens possess at least a bachelor's degree, while over a quarter hold a graduate degree, making it the thirteenth most highly educated municipality in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the early}} 2010s a growing debate {{is taking place}} in Morocco about <b>decriminalization</b> of Cannabis. Powerful {{political}} parties are among advocates of <b>decriminalization,</b> as the Istiqlal Party and the Authenticity and Modernity Party.|$|E

25|$|Leading {{figures in}} the Catholic hierarchy, {{including}} cardinals and bishops, have sometimes actively campaigned against same-sex marriage or have encouraged others to campaign against it, and have done likewise with regard to same-sex civil unions and adoption by same-sex couples, and other LGBT rights (including non-discrimination). Some Church leaders have opposed <b>decriminalization</b> of homosexual activity in certain countries, and stood against a proposed call by the United Nations for global <b>decriminalization</b> of homosexuality. However, in other countries, and again at the United Nations, the church has opposed criminalization - reflecting {{a wide range of}} opinions within the global church.|$|E
25|$|Various UN {{commissions}} however have differing {{positions on}} the issue. For example, in 2012, a UNAIDS commission convened by Ban Ki-moon and backed by UNDP and UNAIDS, recommended the <b>decriminalization</b> of brothels and procuring.|$|E
25|$|Despite drug {{legislation}} (or {{perhaps because}} of it), large, organized criminal drug cartels operate worldwide. Advocates of <b>decriminalization</b> argue that drug prohibition makes drug dealing a lucrative business, leading {{to much of the}} associated criminal activity.|$|E
25|$|There {{is now a}} {{resurgence}} in the attempts to rediscover and revalue African traditional cultures, under such movements as the African Renaissance, led by Thabo Mbeki, Afrocentrism, led {{by a group of}} scholars, including Molefi Asante, as well as the increasing recognition of traditional spiritualism through <b>decriminalization</b> of Vodou and other forms of spirituality.|$|E
25|$|The {{park was}} known as a {{location}} for clandestine meetings of homosexuals {{in the days before the}} <b>decriminalization</b> of homosexuality in Canada in the 1960s. Its reputation as a meeting place persisted for decades afterward. In 1985, a group of five young teenage boys from Toronto suburbs went to High Park and beat to death a 40-year-old male librarian.|$|E
25|$|April â€“ In another conference address apostle Kimball {{called the}} <b>decriminalization</b> of consensual {{same-sex}} sexual activity a damnable heresy, {{and the voices}} speaking in favor of churches accepting homosexuals as ugly and loud.

25|$|Many {{believe that}} Shafer's {{opposition}} to Nixon cost him the federal judgeship {{he was known}} to have desired. President Nixon appointed Shafer as chairman of the National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse, also known as the Shafer Commission.

25|$|Same-sex sexual {{activity}} has been legal in Malta since January 1973. The Prime Minister of Malta, Dom Mintoff, and the Labour Party legislated {{for the removal}} of the British-introduced sodomy law, at the time opposed by the Roman Catholic Church in Malta and the Maltese Nationalist Party. Mikiel Gonzi, Archbishop of Malta, remained staunchly opposed to <b>decriminalization.</b> The age of consent is equal at 18 for all.|$|E
25|$|Wright Park, near downtown, is a large, English-style park {{designed}} in the late 19th century by Edward Otto Schwagerl and Ebenezer Rhys Roberts. It contains Wright Park Arboretum and the W.

25|$|Ranging from solemn to carnivalesque, pride {{events are}} {{typically}} held during LGBT Pride Month {{or some other}} period that commemorates {{a turning point in}} a country's LGBT history, for example Moscow Pride in May for the anniversary of Russia's 1993 <b>decriminalization</b> of homosexuality. Some pride events include LGBT pride parades and marches, rallies, commemorations, community days, dance parties, and large festivals, such as Sydney Mardi Gras, which spans several weeks.|$|E
25|$|Rubio opposes <b>decriminalization</b> {{of illegal}} drugs, {{does not agree}} with {{cannabis}} legalization, but does support non-euphoric medical cannabis. Rubio supports setting corporate taxes at 25 percent, reforming the tax code, and capping economic regulations, and proposes to increase the social security retirement age based on longer life expectancy. On education, he supports expanding public charter schools, opposes Common Core State Standards, and advocates closing the federal Department of Education.|$|E
25|$|In some countries, {{there has}} been a move toward harm {{reduction}} by health services, where the use of illicit drugs is neither condoned nor promoted, but services and support are provided to ensure users have adequate factual information readily available, and that the negative effects of their use be minimized. Such is the case of Portuguese drug policy of <b>decriminalization,</b> which achieved its primary goal of reducing the adverse health effects of drug abuse.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the statements relating to prosecutions of persons because of their sexual orientation, {{the head of the}} delegation said that homosexuality is a purely private matter, with a long history in Senegal, and is not in itself a cause for prosecution. The prosecutions referred to occurred only when the homosexual relations took place in public and were of an obtrusive nature, therefore placing them in conflict with morality and religion. Concerning <b>decriminalization,</b> it is necessary to take account of the culture, and avoid exacerbating the rejection of homosexuals and endangering their lives.|$|E
25|$|In {{a report}} dealing with HIV in June 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) of the UN {{called for the}} <b>decriminalization</b> of drugs {{particularly}} including injected ones. This conclusion put WHO at odds with broader long-standing UN policy favoring criminalization. Eight states of the United States (Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington), {{as well as the}} District of Columbia, have legalized the sale of marijuana for personal recreational use as of 2017, despite the fact that recreational use remains illegal under U.S. federal law. The conflict between state and federal law is as of 2017 unresolved.|$|E
25|$|In the 2010s, {{movements}} have grown {{around the world}} proposing the relegalization and <b>decriminalization</b> of drugs. For instance, there is a movement for cannabis legalization in Canada, {{as well as the}} Marijuana Party of Canada. Drug liberalization policies are often supported by proponents of liberalism and libertarianism on the grounds of individual freedom. There are also growing countermovements. Prohibition of drugs is supported by proponents of conservative values but also by many other types of NGO's that are not linked to conservative political parties. A growing number of NGO organizations in many countries have joined the international network World Federation Against Drugs. WFAD members support the United Nations narcotics conventions.|$|E
25|$|In 1962, {{homosexual}} behaviour was decriminalised in Czechoslovakia, {{following a}} scientific research of Kurt Freund that included phallometry of homosexually oriented men {{who appeared to}} have given up sexual relations with other men and established heterosexual marriages. Freund {{came to the conclusion}} that homosexual orientation may not be changed. The claim that phallometry on men was the reason for <b>decriminalization</b> of homosexual behavior in Czechoslovakia is contradicted by the fact that it applied to women as well, as the notion of a male-specific fixity of sexual orientation as an argument for gay rights combined with the notion of female sexual plasticity is adverse to lesbian rights.|$|E
25|$|Proponents of gedoogbeleid {{argue that}} such a policy {{practices}} more consistency in legal protection than without it. Opponents of the Dutch drug policy either call for full legalization, or argue that laws should penalize morally wrong or deviant behavior, whether enforceable or not. In the Dutch courts, however, {{it has long been}} determined that the institutionalized non-enforcement of statutes with well defined limits constitutes de facto <b>decriminalization.</b> The statutes are kept on the books mainly due to international pressure and in adherence with international treaties. A November 2008 poll showed that a 60% majority of the Dutch population support the legalisation of soft drugs. The same poll showed that 85% supported closing of all cannabis coffeeshops within 250 meters walking distance from schools.|$|E
25|$|Following {{meetings}} between Louis George Tin and French Minister of Human Rights and Foreign Affairs Rama Yade in early 2008, Yade {{announced that she}} would appeal at the UN for the universal <b>decriminalization</b> of homosexuality; the appeal was quickly taken up as an international concern. Co-sponsored by France (which then held the rotating presidency of the EU) and the Netherlands {{on behalf of the}} EU, the declaration had been intended as a resolution; it was decided to use the format of a declaration of a limited group of states because there was not enough support for the adoption of an official resolution by the General Assembly as a whole. The declaration was read out into the General Assembly Record by Ambassador Jorge ArgÃ¼ello of Argentina on 18 December 2008, and was the first declaration concerning gay rights read in the General Assembly.|$|E
25|$|On September 11, 2009, she {{advanced}} the <b>decriminalization</b> of injurious calumny against public officials, a charge which had, in 2000, {{resulted in a}} prison term of one year for Eduardo Kimel, a journalist investigating the San Patricio Church massacre of 1976. She drew fire for a highly controversial Audiovisual Media Law proposed shortly afterwards, however. Defended by the government as a reform intended to fragment ownership of media companies so as to encourage plurality of opinion, the bill was criticised by part of the opposition {{as a means to}} silence voices critical of the government, especially those in the ClarÃ­n media group (the country's largest). However, a significant amount of opposing congressmen voted in favor of the law, as they considered it was clearly an improvement on the existing one; also, the government had been willing to negotiate and modify parts of the proposed new law to improve it.|$|E
25|$|According to ECPAT International, when sex {{industry}} {{women and children}} victims are held in police custody or remand homes, denied freedom and access to information, or abused by police, they are encouraged to lie about their situation and try to escape, so community assistance services are substantially less useful. Similar failures occur when court procedures do not allow victim testimony or representation or, when they do, are neither victim-friendly nor children-friendly; or when decisions on children's futures seldom include the opinions of children, or when {{the right to privacy}} is violated by media reporting, or by stigmatization of and discrimination against children exploited in prostitution. Governments have the duty to provide services to children, but sharing that duty with nonprofits by coordination, monitoring, and support, especially with respect to periodic review of placement, is likely to have the best results. Protection measures for children at all stages of the legal process has not been sufficiently implemented through children-friendly courts, justice systems and law enforcement agencies. <b>Decriminalization</b> of children exploited in prostitution is a substantial gap in addressing survival sex worldwide. Successful law enforcement partnerships have included a campaign of brothel-based prostitutes who policed the recruitment of under-age girls in Bangladesh.|$|E
500|$|Brown's {{attitudes towards}} {{pornography}} have since changed greatly. [...] When he made The Playboy {{he was struggling}} with his embarrassment over buying pornography; two decades later he vocally advocated for the <b>decriminalization</b> of prostitution in Paying for It (2011).|$|E
500|$|In 1973 the National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse {{released}} a report entitled Marijuana: A Signal of Misunderstanding, which recommended [...] "partial prohibition" [...] and <b>decriminalization</b> of possession of small amounts of marijuana. Following this report and extensive lobbying by NORML, 11 states decriminalized cannabis to varying degrees between 1973 (Oregon) and 1978 (Nebraska).|$|E
