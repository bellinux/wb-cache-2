5|$|Both {{in water}} and on land, the newts are largely nocturnal. In their aquatic habitats, they hide under vegetation, and on land, they use {{structures}} such as logs, rocks, or small animal burrows for cover. They feed mainly on different invertebrates, but in the water may also prey on tadpoles and smaller newts. Predators include herons and other birds, snakes such as the <b>grass</b> <b>snake,</b> and various carnivorous mammals.|$|E
5|$|The larvae are {{themselves}} eaten by various {{animals such as}} carnivorous invertebrates and water birds, and are especially vulnerable to predatory fish. Adults generally avoid predators through their hidden lifestyle but are sometimes eaten by herons and other birds, snakes such as the <b>grass</b> <b>snake,</b> and mammals such as shrews, badgers and hedgehogs. They secrete the poison tetrodotoxin from their skin, albeit much less than for example the North American Pacific newts (Taricha). The bright yellow or orange underside of crested newts is a warning coloration which can be presented in case of perceived danger. In such a posture, the newts typically roll up and secrete a milky substance.|$|E

5|$|On April 18, 2010, {{the episode}} of Pokémon Sunday showed game footage {{of a player}} {{character}} walking around in a 3D environment and a single screenshot depicting a battle between the player's Zoroark and an enemy Zorua. Host Shoko Nakagawa made note of how the player's Zoroark's sprite was a full body sprite as viewed from behind, when in the past all such sprites only showed a smaller portion of the player's Pokémon's body. On May 9, 2010, the episode of Pokémon Sunday revealed silhouettes of the three Pokémon available to choose from {{at the beginning of}} the games, which were later revealed to be the <b>Grass</b> <b>Snake</b> Pokémon Tsutarja, the Fire Pig Pokémon Pokabu, and the Sea Otter Pokémon Mijumaru. Other information revealed is that the game takes place in the Isshu Region which includes the Hiun City metropolis. On May 16, 2010, the episode of Pokémon Sunday showed game battle footage, illustrating the new in-battle animations and dynamic camera positioning; also described were Zoroark's Illusion ability and the special Zoroark acquired by the movie ticket pre-order gift Pokémon.|$|E

25|$|The {{island is}} home to a variety of reptiles. The Balkan terrapin (Mauremys rivulata) can be found near fresh water along with the Greek marsh frog (Pelophylax kurtmuelleri), though this habitat is slowly disappearing due to development. The Balkan wall lizard (Podarcis taurica) is seen {{regularly}} in daylight in warm weather and the Hemidactylus turcicus at night. A larger lizard is the Balkan green lizard (Lacerta trilineata). Several varieties of snakes can be observed: the Montpellier snake (Malpolon monspessulanus), the leopard snake (Elephe situla), the large whip snake (Coluber jugularis), the <b>grass</b> <b>snake</b> (Natrix natrix), and a species of viper.|$|E
50|$|The meadow is flower-rich wet grassland. Flora include common spotted orchids, cuckooflowers, meadowsweets, marsh-marigolds and ragged-robins. There {{are also}} <b>grass</b> <b>snakes</b> and birds such as blackcaps.|$|R
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of a parasitic nematode of slow worms, Neoxysomatium brevicaudatum, was also investigated using PCR primers. Prevalence was higher in {{males and females}} in April. Analysis of smooth snake diet confirmed that predation on reptiles was high but revealed increasing consumption of small mammals with age. Predation on reptiles by <b>grass</b> <b>snakes</b> was higher than expected and suggests competition may exist between smooth <b>snakes</b> and <b>grass</b> <b>snakes</b> at a juvenile stage. Overall, these results provide information pertinent to translocation and reintroduction programmes along with conservation management strategies.

25|$|Camouflage {{will not}} always fool a predator. When caught out, snake species will adopt {{different}} defensive tactics {{and use a}} complicated set of behaviors when attacked. Some will first elevate their head and spread out the skin of their neck {{in an effort to}} look large and threatening. Failure of this strategy may lead to other measures practiced particularly by cobras, vipers, and closely related species, who use venom to attack. The venom is modified saliva, delivered through fangs from a venom gland. Some non-venomous snakes, such as American hognose snakes or European <b>grass</b> <b>snake,</b> play dead when in danger.|$|E
25|$|Animals {{are often}} used to {{represent}} football clubs in Italy – the <b>grass</b> <b>snake,</b> called Biscione or Serpente, represents Inter. The snake is an important symbol {{for the city of}} Milan, appearing often in Milanese heraldry as a coiled viper with a man in its jaws. The symbol is famous for its presence on the coat of arms of the House of Sforza (which ruled over Italy from Milan during the Renaissance period), the city of Milan, the historical Duchy of Milan (a 400-year state of the Holy Roman Empire) and Insubria (a historical region the city of Milan falls within). For the 2010–11 season, Inter's away kit featured the serpent.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} whether individual snakes are immune {{to their own}} venom {{has not yet been}} definitively settled, though there is a known example of a cobra which self-envenomated, resulting in a large abscess requiring surgical intervention, but showing none of the other effects that would have proven rapidly lethal in prey species or humans. Furthermore, certain harmless species, such as the North American common kingsnake (Lampropeltis getula) and the Central and South American mussurana (Clelia spp.), are proof against the venom of the crotalines which frequent the same districts, and which they are able to overpower and feed upon. The chicken snake (Spilotes pullatus) is the enemy of the Fer-de-Lance (Bothrops caribbaeus) in St. Lucia, and it is said that in their encounters, the chicken snake is invariably the victor. Repeated experiments have shown the European <b>grass</b> <b>snake</b> (Natrix natrix) not to be affected by the bite of the European adder (Vipera berus) and the European asp (Vipera aspis), this being due to the presence, in the blood of the harmless snake, of toxic principles secreted by the parotid and labial glands, and analogous to those of the venom of these vipers. Several North American species of rat snakes as well as king snakes have proven to be immune or highly resistant to the venom of rattlesnake species. The king cobra, which does prey on cobras is said to be immune to their venom.|$|E

Many bird species breed on the Quantocks, {{including}} the grasshopper warbler (Locustella naevia), nightjar (Caprimulgus europaeus), raven (Corvus corax) and the European pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca). The Quantocks are {{also an important}} site for red deer (Cervus elaphus). Invertebrates of note include the silver-washed fritillary butterfly (Argynnis paphia), and three nationally rare dead-wood beetles: Thymalus limbatus, Orchesia undulata and Rhinosimus ruficollis.|$|E
500|$|Vipera berus, {{the common}} European adder or common European viper, is a venomous snake that is {{extremely}} widespread {{and can be}} found throughout most of Western Europe and as far as East Asia. Known by a host of common names including common adder and common viper, adders {{have been the subject of}} much folklore in Britain and other European countries. [...] They are not regarded as especially dangerous; the snake is not aggressive and usually bites only when alarmed or disturbed. Bites can be very painful, but are seldom fatal. The specific name, berus, is New Latin and was at one time used to refer to a snake, possibly the <b>grass</b> <b>snake,</b> Natrix natrix.|$|E

Over 70 aquatic and bankside vascular plants have been recorded including frogbit (Hydrocharis morsus-ranae), flowering rush (Butomus umbellatus), wood club-rush (Scirpus sylvaticus) and lesser water-plantain (Baldellia ranunculoides). Over 100 species of aquatic invertebrates inhabit the ditches including one nationally rare soldier fly, (Odontomyia ornata) and 13 nationally scarce species including the water beetles Agabus uliginosus, Hydaticus transversalis and Helophorus nanus. In winter the flooded fields provide food for large numbers of waterfowl with several thousand lapwing (Vanellus vanellus), hundreds of snipe (Gallinago gallinago) and smaller numbers of golden plover (Pluvialis apricaria) and dunlin (Calidris alpina) regularly present. Over two hundred Bewick's swans (Cygnus bewickii) have been recorded, making the site an internationally important wintering ground for this species. Raptor species such as short-eared owl (Asio flammeus), merlin (Falco columbarius) and peregrine (Falco peregrinus) regularly hunt over the site in winter. Vertebrate species present include <b>grass</b> <b>snake</b> (Natrix natrix) and common frog Rana temporaria. Otters (Lutra lutra) are regularly recorded on the site.|$|E
2500|$|In the 18th century, the {{reptiles}} were, {{from the}} outset of classification, grouped with the amphibians.
