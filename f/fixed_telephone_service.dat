40|$|In {{this paper}} we are {{interested}} in investigating the effects of the threepart tariffs system on consumers´ behavior in the local <b>fixed</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>service</b> provided by the incumbent Telecommunications Company une in Medellín, which was authorized by the TelecommunicationsRegulatory Commission (crt, for its Spanish name). In order to study consumer behavior and the effect of this tariff system we specify a sort of Engel Curve, which relates expenditure in <b>fixed</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>service</b> and expenditure in public utilities. Endogeneity problems could well arise from this specification, so the empirical strategy for studying households´ consumption is based on a panel data analysis by performing instrumental variables and gmm procedures. Our results supports the hypothesis that consumers surpass expected consumption levels and therefore the total payment for the service is greater than planned, showing a sort of short-run irrationality in consumption. three-part tariffs, consumers´ behavior, rationality, endogeneity,gmm estimators. ...|$|E

40|$|In some ways, the Russian {{telecommunications}} {{industry is a}} paradox. Parts of the industry are highly competitive – the number of operators in this market is in the thousands – but the existing regulatory regime is weak, particularly in ensuring access to essential facilities, and the longdistance market {{is dominated by the}} company Rostelecom. In spring 2001, experts from OECD countries met with senior Russian officials to discuss their experiences with regulatory reform in telecommunications. The issues discussed include tariff reform, promoting universal service and ensuring access to non-competitive services. Traditionally, in Russia, prices for local <b>fixed</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>service</b> have been held very low, leading to a shortage of supply and significant cross-subsidies from long-distance services. The cross-subsidies from long-distance services are being eroded by new entry, leaving local operators unable to expand the network to meet demand. As in other Russian industries, tariff rebalancing is essential, while putting in place programmes to ensure access to telecommunications services in remoter areas. Competition could be deepened and broadened through a stronger and more effective system of access to the remaining non-competitive services such as local loops. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{intensive}} {{technological development}} of the last years brought the overall acceptance of an IP based network and services vision based on the NGN. The realization of the NGN vision, the decision on the migration to NGN sets regulatory tasks, especially {{in the area of}} numbering and addressing. The utilization of the opportunities provided by the NGN platform requires the use of IP addresses and names in the core network, the role of the E. 164 numbers is taken over by IP addresses. However in case of voice services the identification of end-user access points will remain by the use of E. 164 numbers. Migration to NGN doesn't require directly the change of the subscribers' phone number; however the NGN enables among others the implementation of national number portability for <b>fixed</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>service.</b> The opportunities can be realized by using uniform domestic number length and dialling method, practically closed numbering. The introduction of a 9 -digit uniform, closed domestic numbering provides a consistent solution for the deficiencies of the present Hungarian numbering plan, too. Recently it can be reached in single step so that the present 9 -digit domestic numbers and the short codes remain unchanged, the 8 -digit domestic numbers are completed to 9 -digit by the insertion of an appropriate digit, as well as the present and new numbering schemes can be in operation simultaneously.

40|$|This paper {{hypothesized}} that extensive telecommunications liberalization would not increase the penetration {{rate of the}} <b>fixed</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>service</b> better than other, less competition-oriented, policy alternatives. The hypothesis was validated {{in the case of}} Thailand and the Philippines. Thus, the paper demonstrates that past research has not paid sufficient attention to this issue and has assumed that the more extensive reform could always lead to the faster and the better telecommunications development of telecommunication services. The findings of this paper suggest that the non-competition-oriented policy alternatives could be an effective way to reduce the digital divide gap in developing countries, if implemented and introduced properly. The conditions for successful implementation pf the policies that could help reducing the digital divide gap are: 1) the government perceives the service as a basic necessity; and 2) the government strictly commits and implements purposeful policies with the intention of increasing penetration rates of the services through the distribution of service provision authority. The paper also suggested that less-developed countries (LDCs) should realize {{that they do not have}} to fully implement liberalization reforms, but should instead specifically tailor their telecommunications reform policies to their own pace and needs. The paper results have the policy implication that liberalization can be a useful and effective alternative to lead to higher penetration rates, when and only if, the country and its people understand its goals, effects and implications and, more importantly, when the government provides the policy framework for universal service and addresses the issue of digital divide for the benefits of its people so that the telecommunications liberalization can lead to self-sustainable development...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{hypothesized}} that extensive telecommunications liberalization would not increase the penetration {{rate of the}} <b>fixed</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>service</b> better than other, less competition-oriented, policy alternatives. The hypothesis was validated {{in the case of}} Thailand and the Philippines. However, for the cellular mobile telephone and Internet services, extensive telecommunications liberalization could increase the penetration rates better than other, less competition-oriented, policy alternatives. Thus, the thesis demonstrates that past research has not paid sufficient attention to this issue and has assumed that the more extensive reform could lead to the faster and the better telecommunications development of all telecommunication services. The thesis suggested that less-developed countries (LDCs) should realize {{that they do not have}} to fully implement liberalization reforms, but should instead specifically tailor their telecommunications reform policies to their own pace and needs. This study found that extensive liberalization reforms or extensive opening of the market does not necessarily increase penetration rates of services better than other less competition-oriented policy alternatives under the following conditions: Assuming that the services have not yet reached their saturation levels based on the S-curve,(cont.) 1. Users perceive the service as a necessity; and 2. the government perceives the service as a basic necessity; and 3. the government strictly commits and implements purposeful policies with the intention of increasing penetration rates of the services through the distribution of service provision authority. Or, 4. If the liberalization is implemented after the saturation level of the service is reached. The thesis results have the policy implication that liberalization can be a useful and effective alternative to lead to higher penetration rates, when and only if, the country and its people understand its goals, effects and implications and, more importantly, when the government provides the policy framework for universal service for the benefits of its people so that the liberalization can lead to self-sustainable development. by Donyaprueth Krairit.
