5|$|The work on Integrative Negotiation Consensus Building and the Mutual Gains Approach {{provide a}} helpful {{theoretical}} <b>framework</b> <b>for</b> developing {{the theory of}} urban design management. Negotiation theory provides a useful <b>framework</b> <b>for</b> merging the perspectives of urban planning, city design, and real estate project proposals regarding production of the built environment. Interests, a key construct in negotiation theory, is an important variable that will allow integrated development, as defined above, to occur. The path-breaking work of Roger Fisher and William Ury (1981), Getting to yes, advises negotiators to focus on interests and mutual gains instead of bargaining over positions.|$|E
