5|$|The E Series Clubsport R8 {{takes its}} {{fundamental}} body structure {{from the mainstream}} VE Commodore. It is also the standard model in the HSV line-up. With the deletion of lower lines of V8 HSV models the Clubsport slipped down to the entry level HSV V8, {{on a par with}} the Manta of the VR-VS-VT series. As such the sales of E Series Clubsports <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>over</b> shadowed by the sales of the E Series GTS.|$|E

25|$|The most {{frequent}} disagreement {{of the letter}} reversals <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>over</b> the Haha–Hung pair. The most convincing evidence suggesting this reversal is {{in the names of}} the letters: The unvoiced letter Haha is deep, while the voiced Hung, which suggests a lower position, is tall. This is often assumed to be a clerical error introduced in the rushed printing of the Shavian edition of Androcles and the Lion. This reversal obscures the system of tall letters as voiceless consonants and deep letters as voiced consonants.|$|E
25|$|According to Article 475 of the Japanese Code of Criminal Procedure, {{the death}} penalty must be {{executed}} within {{six months after the}} failure of the prisoner's final appeal upon an order from the Minister of Justice. However, the period requesting retrial or pardon is exempt from this regulation. Therefore, in practice, the typical stay on death row is between five and seven years; a quarter of the prisoners have been on death row for over ten years. For several, the stay <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>over</b> 30 years (Sadamichi Hirasawa died of natural causes at the age of 95, after awaiting execution for 32 years).|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of Ontarians are of English or other European descent including large Scottish, Irish and Italian communities. Slightly less than 5 {{percent of the}} population of Ontario is Franco-Ontarian, that is those whose native tongue is French, although those with French ancestry account for 11 {{percent of the population}}. In relation to natural increase or inter-provincial migration, immigration is a huge population growth force in Ontario, as it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>over</b> the last two centuries. More recent sources of immigrants with large or growing communities in Ontario include South Asians, Caribbeans, Latin Americans, Europeans, Asians, and Africans. Most populations have settled in the larger urban centres.|$|E

25|$|There are not {{too many}} {{instances}} of limiting primary picketing. Typically, the debate <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>over</b> whether secondary picketing can be restricted; this practice of picketing businesses not directly involved in a labour dispute {{has in the past}} been banned under the common law. The most significant decision on limiting primary picketing is BCGEU v. BC (1988) where employees at the British Columbia Supreme Court, who were protesting as part of a province-wide public service employee strike, were ordered back to work by the Chief Justice of the court. The order was found to clearly violate section 2(b) but the Supreme Court upheld it on section 1.|$|E
25|$|A {{controversy}} {{dating from}} 1999 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>over</b> {{the adoption of}} civil unions, an institution which grants same-sex couples nearly all the rights and privileges of marriage at the state, but not federal, level. In Baker v. Vermont (1999), the Vermont Supreme Court ruled that, under the Constitution of Vermont, the state must either allow same-sex marriage or provide a separate but equal status for them. The state legislature chose the second option by creating the institution of civil union; the bill {{was passed by the}} legislature and signed into law by Governor Howard Dean. In April 2009 the state legislature overrode governor Jim Douglas's veto to allow same-sex marriage, becoming the first state in the nation to legalize same-sex marriage through legislation. In September 2009 Vermont became the fourth state in which same-sex couples could marry.|$|E
25|$|The {{winter in}} Seoul is {{controlled}} by the large Siberian high pressure system (the Asiatic high), which results in predominantly cold, dry north-westerly winds. The influence of the Siberian high leads to significantly colder winter temperatures than would be expected at this latitude. About every 4 to 6 days a low-pressure trough will move through South Korea, bringing with it cloudiness and light precipitation. The amount of precipitation locally depends mostly on the elevation of the station and the length of time that the air <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>over</b> the Yellow Sea. Maximum snowfall occurs over the northwest coast, which is the most exposed to the northwesterly flow, and in the mountain areas. Normally less than 10 percent of the annual precipitation falls during the winter. Frequently the weather is cloudless, clear, and dry, except for the southwestern region of the peninsula. The mean January temperature in Seoul is -2.4°C (27°F). January, is the coldest month in Seoul.|$|E

25|$|Margherita Guarducci relates a {{tradition}} that the original icon of Mary attributed to Luke, sent by Eudokia to Pulcheria from Palestine, was a large circular icon only of her head. When the icon arrived in Constantinople it was fitted in as the head into a very large rectangular icon of her holding the Christ child {{and it is this}} composite icon that became the one historically known as the Hodegetria. She further states another tradition that when the last Latin Emperor of Constantinople, Baldwin II, fled Constantinople in 1261 he took this original circular portion of the icon with him. This remained in the possession of the Angevin dynasty who had it likewise inserted into a much larger image of Mary and the Christ child, which is presently enshrined above the high altar of the Benedictine Abbey church of Montevergine. Unfortunately this icon <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>over</b> the subsequent centuries subjected to repeated repainting, so {{that it is difficult to}} determine what the original image of Mary’s face would have looked like. However, Guarducci also states that in 1950 an ancient image of Mary at the Church of Santa Francesca Romana was determined to be a very exact, but reverse mirror image of the original circular icon that was made in the 5th century and brought to Rome, where it has remained until the present.|$|E

500|$|The episode flashbacks to the {{previous}} developments of several storylines throughout the season, including the love triangle between Rick, Shane, and Lori. Mazzara iterated that upon hearing of her husband's revelations, Lori was conflicted with several issues. [...] "All of that is going through Lori's mind. Rick murdered Shane and she did confess she had feelings for Shane. Her son {{was a part of}} it. They're all infected. Is her baby infected? We're out on the road, where is she going to give birth? What happens if the baby dies? What happens if she dies? All of these questions are going through her head. The thing that affects her most is that she played a role in Shane's death. She put those two men at odds, she whispered in Rick's ear and then she talked to Shane at the windmill. She realizes that this <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>over</b> her, and in a sense she has been an active participant in Shane's death. So she can blame Rick for that, but she's horrified by her own culpability." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{idea behind}} {{radiocarbon}} dating is straightforward, but {{years of work}} were required to develop the technique {{to the point where}} accurate dates could be obtained. Research has been ongoing since the 1960s to determine what the proportion of [...] in the atmosphere <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>over</b> the past fifty thousand years. The resulting data, {{in the form of a}} calibration curve, is now used to convert a given measurement of radiocarbon in a sample into an estimate of the sample's calendar age. Other corrections must be made to account for the proportion of [...] in different types of organisms (fractionation), and the varying levels of [...] throughout the biosphere (reservoir effects). [...] Additional complications come from the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil, and from the above-ground nuclear tests done in the 1950s and 1960s. Because the time it takes to convert biological materials to fossil fuels is substantially longer than the time it takes for its [...] to decay below detectable levels, fossil fuels contain almost no , and as a result there was a noticeable drop in the proportion of [...] in the atmosphere beginning in the late 19th century. Conversely, nuclear testing increased the amount of [...] in the atmosphere, which attained a maximum in 1963 of almost twice what it had been before the testing began.|$|E
500|$|There {{has been}} much {{discussion}} amongst academics {{about the extent to}} which Raglan was influenced by contemporary French designs; one school of thought suggests that it was heavily influenced by designs that were then popular in the south of France; others oppose this [...] "diffusionist" [...] school of thought, and argue that there is insufficient evidence to draw such a conclusion. Another line of debate <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>over</b> the nature of the castle's defences, in particular its gunloops. Many castles built around the same time as Raglan appear to have been built with less concern for defences than in the past, their military features more symbolic than real. At Raglan, there are numerous gunloops throughout the castle's defences, but many were ill-placed if the intention was to use them in a conflict; some could barely have been used at all. Traditionally, an evolutionary explanation for this was given: Raglan's gunloops were of an early period, later surpassed in other castles. More recent explanations emphasis the prestigious symbolism of gunloops for the Herbert family when they built the castle, even if many might have been impossible to use. Anthony Emery notes that Raglan's gunloops were better sited than many at the time, and at least [...] "the owner was up to date in his symbolism"; Robert Liddiard suggests that the poor placing of some of the gunloops for aesthetic purposes might have actually been a conversation point for those visitors with experience of fighting in France and the [...] "correct" [...] placing of such defences.|$|E
