5|$|Boranes are {{chemical}} compounds of boron and hydrogen, with the generic formula of BxHy. These compounds {{do not occur}} in nature. Many of the boranes readily oxidise on contact with air, some violently. The parent member BH3 is called borane, but it is known only in the gaseous state, and dimerises to form <b>diborane,</b> B2H6. The larger boranes all consist of boron clusters that are polyhedral, some of which exist as isomers. For example, isomers of B20H26 {{are based on the}} fusion of two 10-atom clusters.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{routes to}} elemental boron involved {{the reduction of}} boric oxide with metals such as magnesium or aluminium. However, the product is almost always contaminated with borides of those metals. Pure boron can be prepared by reducing volatile boron halides with hydrogen at high temperatures.

Germanium dioxide is sometimes used as a catalyst in the production of PET plastic for containers; cheaper antimony compounds, such as the trioxide or triacetate, are more commonly employed for the same purpose despite concerns about antimony contamination of food and drinks. Arsenic trioxide has been used in the production of natural gas, to boost the removal of carbon dioxide, as have selenous acid and tellurous acid. Selenium acts as a catalyst in some microorganisms. Tellurium, and its dioxide and tetrachloride, are strong catalysts for air oxidation of carbon above 500°C.

40|$|Abstract-The {{synthesis}} {{and chemical}} properties {{of a series}} of novel unsatu-rated <b>diboranes</b> L-Q with both boron atoms in allylic positions are described. Some new reactions of allylboranes, presented in the second section, proceed either with rearrangement (2 rrt 2 n+ 2 ul or with retention of configuration of the allylic fragment. Convenient methods for the preparation of allyl- and diallyloxiranes, homoallylic alcohols and thiols, as well as an approach for designing cyclic structures via allylboranes are suggested. A 1 1 yl boranes occupy an except ional posit ion among organoboron compounds. They differ essentially in properties and reactivity from aliphatic, vinylic and aromatic analogues due to their specific structure (p, y-double bond) and, as a consequence, their ability to react with a (27 ~+ 217 + 2 ~) -type rearrangement [1 - 41. Allylboranes readily add to compounds with multiple bonds (C=O, C=N, CEN, C=C and CzC 3 [2, 31, that is quite nontypical for other classes of organobora-nes [1, 2, 41.

40|$|Our recent novel finding, {{involving}} a synergistic experiment and first-principles theory, shows that carbon nanostructures {{can be used}} as catalysts for hydrogen uptake/release in aluminum based complex metal hydrides (sodium alanate) and also provides an unambiguous understanding of how the catalysts work. Here we show that the same concepts can be applied to boron based complex hydride such as lithium borohydride, LiBH{sub 4 }. Taking into account electronegativity and curvature effect a fullerene-LiBH{sub 4 } composite demonstrates catalytic properties with not only lowered hydrogen desorption temperatures, but regenerative rehydriding at relatively lower temperature of 350 C. This catalytic effect likely originates from interfering with the charge transfer from Li to the BH 4 moiety, resulting in an ionic bond between Li{sup +} and BH{sub 4 }{sup -}, and a covalent bond between B and H. Interaction of LiBH{sub 4 } with an electronegative substrate such as carbon fullerene affects the ability of Li to donate its charge to BH{sub 4 }, consequently weakening the B-H bond and causing hydrogen to desorb at lower temperatures as well as facilitating the absorption of H{sub 2 } to reverse the dehydrogenation reaction.

40|$|The {{main focus}} of this thesis has been {{directed}} towards preparation and oxidative carbocyclization of en-, dien- and aza-enallenes. In {{the first part of}} this thesis, a stereoselective oxidative carbocyclization of dienallenes was realized. By employing cheap and readily available palladium trifluoroacetate we were able to efficiently cyclize a variety of dienallenes into hydroxylated carbocycles in high yield and high selectivity. This oxidative process was compatible with two different reoxidation protocols: one relying on p-benzoquinone (BQ) as the oxidant and the other employing molecular oxygen as the oxidant. In the second part of the thesis the carbocyclization methodology was extended to include carbocyclization of aza-enallenes. This was achieved in two distinct steps. First, a copper-catalyzed coupling of allylic sulfonamides with bromoallenes was developed, giving access to the corresponding aza-enallenes. Subjecting these substrates to catalytic amounts of palladium acetate, along with BQ as the oxidant, rendered N-heterocycles in good yield. The reactivity of these N-heterocycles towards activated dienophiles was later exploited in a tandem (aerobic) oxidative carbocyclization/Diels-Alder reaction. The third topic involves efficient oxidative arylative/borylative carbocyclization of enallenes. These reactions, catalyzed by palladium acetate, relies on transmetallation of a (σ-alkyl) palladium(II) intermediate with <b>diboranes</b> or arylboronic acids. With this novel methodology we were able to obtain an array of arylated or borylated carbocycles, as single diastereomers, in high yield. Finally, we developed a palladium(II) -catalyzed cyclization of allylic carbamates. This mild, operationally simple, and scalable catalytic reaction opens up access to an array of oxazolidinones in high yield and excellent diastereoselectivity.

Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die {{oxidative}} Addition einer Bor-Halogen-Bindung an ein Platin(0) -Komplex selektiv verläuft und in trans-Diboran(4) yl-Bisphosphan-Platin-Komplexen resultiert. Bei Verwendung von 1, 2 -Dihalogen- 1, 2 -diaryldiboranen(4) findet sich in den korrespondierenden trans-Diboran(4) yl-Platin-Komplexen eine dative Bindung des Platin-Zentralatoms zum entfernten zweiten Bor-Atom, welche sowohl in Lösung als auch im Festkörper beobachtet wird. Die erhaltenen trans-Diboran(4) yl-Komplexe wurden auf ihre Reaktivität untersucht, hierbei konnte erstmals durch Reduktion ein Diboren-Platin-Komplex synthetisiert werden. Die Untersuchung der Reaktivität von nicht-metallischen Lewis-Basen ergab eine Reihe von sp 2 -sp 3 -Diboranen an die entweder PEt 3 oder PMeCy 2 koordiniert ist. In Abhängigkeit des sterischen Anspruches finden sich zwei Isomere mit 1, 2 - und 1, 1 '-Anordnung der Halogene.

Using 1, 2 -dihalo- 1, 2 -diaryldiboranes(4) for the oxidative addition to platinum(0) reveals the corresponding trans-diboran(4) yl platinum complexes with a dative platinum boron bond to the remoted boron atom of the diboran(4) yl ligand.

25|$|Knowing {{that the}} group {{containing}} the boron {{will be replaced by}} a hydroxyl group, {{it can be seen that}} the initial hydroboration step determines the regioselectivity.

25|$|Boranes react {{rapidly to}} alkenes {{in a process}} called hydroboration.

Although <b>diborane</b> as a pure compound is a dimer, BH3 forms 1:1 complexes with basic solvents, for instance THF. In an ordinary electrophilic addition reaction of HX (X = Cl, Br, I, etc.), Markovnikov's rule, which states that the less electronegative atom, usually hydrogen, adds to the least substituted carbon of the double bond, this determines regioselectivity. With boranes the mode of action is the same, the hydrogen adds to the most substituted carbon because boron is less electronegative than hydrogen. When a positive charge develops in the alkene on the most substituted carbon atom, {{that is where the}} partially negatively charged hydrogen atom adds, leaving the least substituted carbon atom for the boron atom. The so-called anti-Markovnikov addition because when the boron is replaced with a hydroxyl group the overall reaction is addition of water over the double bond in what appears to be an anti-Makovnikov addition.|$|E
