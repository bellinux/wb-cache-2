Although the European Union Directives do not mandate certification to ISO 9001 and/or ISO 13485 the preferred method to prove compliance to such standards is to seek its official certification which is issued by certifying organizations known as [...] "Registrars".

The affinity can be measured using a variety of assays, most requiring that the reading takes place when equilibrium has occurred. The increased focus on high-affinity antibodies (typically KD < 1 nM) has led to a situation where the time to equilibrium increases vastly.
