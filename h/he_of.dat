He had himself already secretly married Maria Fitzherbert; however, his marriage to Fitzherbert violated the Royal Marriages Act 1772 and thus was not legally valid.|$|E

He is closely identified with a faction of the company led by Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton. Although profits proved elusive for their investors, the visions for the Colony of Sir Edwin Sandys and the Earl of Southampton were eventually accomplished.|$|E

25|$|The triumph was short-lived, and {{somewhat}} pyrrhic, however. It actually made {{the elevation of}} William {{to the office of}} captain-general in February, 1672, more difficult to deflect, as the danger of a combination of the functions of stadtholder and commander-in-chief no longer threatened. The 21-year-old Prince was therefore duly given the command of the army (with De Witt's grudging assent), just before the war started, making him share in the responsibility for the military debacle, which <b>he,</b> <b>of</b> course, in the circumstances could not avoid. De Witt hoped to control him with the deputies-in-the-field, an institution that Marlborough would come heartily to detest when he in turn was appointed lieutenant-captain-general of the Union in 1702. But circumstances now allowed him to wrest free from political control.|$|E

25|$|The short reigns of Emperor Wu's grandsons, Xiao Zhaoye and Xiao Zhaowen (his {{first son}} predeceased him), were {{dominated}} by Xiao Luan, Emperor's Wu's first cousin. He killed them in turn and crowned himself as Emperor Ming of Southern Qi. Using the government secretaries (典簽官), he slaughtered all the descendants of Emperors Gao and Wu. Emperor Ming soon became very ill and started following Daoism, changing his whole wardrobe to red. He also passed an edict making officials try to find silver fish (銀魚). He died in 498 and was succeeded by his son Xiao Baojuan, who killed high officials and governors at whim, sparking many revolts. The final revolt in 501 started after Xiao Baojun killed his prime minister Xiao Yi, leading his brother Xiao Yan to revolt {{under the banner of}} Xiao Baojun's brother who was declared Emperor <b>He</b> <b>of</b> Southern Qi. Xiao Baojun was killed by one of his generals during the siege of his capital at Jiankang, and after a short puppet reign by Emperor He, Xiao Yan overthrew the Southern Qi and established the Liang dynasty.|$|E
25|$|Bhishma means <b>He</b> <b>of</b> {{the terrible}} oath, {{referring}} to his vow of lifelong celibacy. Originally named Devavratha, he became known as Bhishma after he took the bhishama pratigya ('terrible oath') — the vow of lifelong celibacy and of service to whomever sat on the throne of his father (the throne of Hastinapur). He took this oath so that his father, Shantanu could marry a fisherwoman Satyavati — Satyavati's father had refused to give his daughter's hand to Shantanu {{on the grounds that}} his daughter's children would never be rulers. This made Shantanu despondent, and upon discovering the reason for his father's despondency, Devavratha sought out the girl's father and promised him that he would never stake a claim to the throne, implying that the child born to Shantanu and Satyavati would become the ruler after Shantanu. At this, Satyavati's father retorted that even if Devavratha gave up his claim to the throne, his (Devavratha's) children would still claim the throne. Devavratha then took the vow of lifelong celibacy, thus sacrificing his 'crown-prince' title and denying himself the pleasures of conjugal love. This gave him immediate recognition among the gods. His father granted him the boon of Ichcha Mrityu (control over his own death — he could choose the time of his death, making him immortal till his chosen time of death, instead of completely immortal which would have been an even more severe curse and cause of suffering).|$|E

500|$|By {{the late}} Eastern Han period, the {{peasantry}} had become largely landless and served wealthy landowners. This cost the government significant tax revenue. Although {{the central government}} under Emperor <b>He</b> <b>of</b> Han (r. 88–105 AD) reduced taxes in times of natural disaster and distress without much effect upon the treasury, successive rulers became less {{able to cope with}} major crises. The government soon relied upon local administrations to conduct relief efforts. After the central government failed to provide local governments with provisions during both a locust swarm and the flooding of the Yellow River in 153 AD, many landless peasants became retainers of large landowners in exchange for aid. Patricia Ebrey writes that the Eastern Han was the [...] "transitional period" [...] between the Western Han—when small independent farmers were the vast majority—and the Three Kingdoms (220–265 AD) and later Sixteen Kingdoms (304–439 AD), when large family estates used unfree labor.|$|E

[...] Han dynasty librarian Wang Yi, best known as the compiler of the received version of the Verses of Chu, wrote several object-description fu in the early 2nd century AD, such as [...] "Fu on the Lychee" [...] (Lìzhī fù [...] ), the earliest known poetic description of the lychee fruit.|$|E

500|$|The {{majority}} in the Uitvoerend Bewind (Gerrit Pijman in particular) therefore amended the project {{in a sense that}} gave re-federalization even more emphasis. They unilaterally convened the primary assemblies by a proclamation on 14 September 1801, have a referendum on this new draft constitution. The Assembly defiantly ruled this proclamation illegal on 18 September. Then General Augereau (<b>he</b> <b>of</b> the Fructidor-coup), now commander-in-chief of the French forces in the Netherlands, routinely closed the doors of the Assembly (by previous arrangement with Pijman) on 19 September, and arrested the dissident Directors. Despite this military putsch the campaign for the plebiscite took place in an atmosphere of political freedom unthinkable in France. Nevertheless, this did not result in great enthusiasm for the new constitution. When the votes were counted on 1 October, out of 416,619 voters only 16,771 voted in favor and 52,219 against. The Directors then used a sleight of hand that unfortunately would also become familiar in the Dutch constitutional politics of the successor states: they counted the 350,000 abstentions as [...] "tacit affirmations".|$|E
500|$|Other critics voiced more {{negative}} {{opinions of the}} track.

Unfortunately the cracks are all you hear." [...] Spin referred to the single as a [...] "swing and a miss". USA Today likened the track to Gaga's past work and said, [...] "While not perfect, it's buoyant and fun enough, we suppose. Just not groundbreaking." [...] Pitchforks Jillian Mapes felt that [...] "Perfect Illusion" [...] did {{not live up to}} its significant anticipation, criticizing the song's production and Gaga's vocal performance. While ranking Lady Gaga's lead singles from worst to best, Billboard listed [...] "Perfect Illusion" [...] as second-worst, ahead of only [...] "Applause" [...] (2013). Rolling Stone ranked it number 28 on their Best Songs of 2016 list, stating, [...] "Gaga fuses her neo-folkie Lilith-hippie mode with her disco roots in this Mark Ronson-produced dance-floor confession." ...|$|E
500|$|Hordern left Brighton College in {{the early}} 1930s and secured {{a job as a}} {{teaching}} assistant in a prep school in Beaconsfield. He joined an amateur dramatics company and in his spare time, rehearsed for the company's only play, Ritzio's Boots, which was entered into a British Drama League competition, with Hordern in the title role. [...] The play did well but conceded the prize, a professional production at a leading London theatre, to Not This Man, a drama written by Sydney Box. [...] So envious was <b>he</b> <b>of</b> the rival show's success that Hordern supplied a scathing review to The Welwyn Times calling Box's show a [...] "blasphemous bunk and cheap theatrical claptrap". The comment infuriated Box, who issued the actor with a writ to attend court on a count of slander. Hordern won the case and left Box liable for the proceeding's expenses. Years later the two men met on a film set where Box, much to Hordern's surprise, thanked him for helping to kick-start his career in film making, as he had received a lot of publicity {{as a result of the}} court case.|$|E
