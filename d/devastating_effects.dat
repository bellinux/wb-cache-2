5|$|Grasshoppers {{have had}} a long {{relationship}} with humans. Swarms of locusts can have <b>devastating</b> <b>effects</b> and cause famine, and even in smaller numbers, the insects can be serious pests. They are used as food {{in countries such as}} Mexico and Indonesia. They feature in art, symbolism and literature.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Abdulkadir Ahmed Said {{released}} the Somali-Italian co-production La Conchiglia (Aleel). Another environmentally conscious short film, it predicted the <b>devastating</b> <b>effects</b> that illegal toxic waste dumping by foreign vessels {{would have on}} local marine life and the fishermen who depended on it.|$|E
5|$|Oil spills have <b>devastating</b> <b>effects</b> on the environment. Crude oil {{contains}} polycyclic {{aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) which {{are very difficult to}} clean up, and last for years in the sediment and marine environment. Marine species constantly exposed to PAHs can exhibit developmental problems, susceptibility to disease, and abnormal reproductive cycles.|$|E

5|$|The 1951 novel The Troubled Air by Irwin Shaw {{tells the}} story of the {{director}} of a (fictional) radio show, broadcast live at the time, who is given a deadline to investigate his cast for alleged links to communism. The novel recounts the <b>devastating</b> <b>effects</b> on all concerned.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} had <b>devastating</b> <b>effects</b> on {{the places}} it hit. It {{killed at least}} 1,000people directly, {{and a total of}} 1,800 people. At that time, it was Mexico's worst natural disaster in recent times. Most of the destruction was in Colima and Jalisco. A preliminary estimate of property damage was $280million (1959USD).|$|E
5|$|The {{invasive}} species {{that causes the}} most damage to bird populations is the cat (Felis catus), both domestic and feral. Cats that are let outside live close to suburban populations and have been estimated to number 640per square mile. In such close numbers in historic migratory areas, they have <b>devastating</b> <b>effects</b> on migratory bird populations.|$|E
50|$|The Montiserrat ameiva has {{declined}} significantly since the Soufrière Hills volcano became active in 1995; eruptions {{have had a}} <b>devastating</b> <b>effect</b> on Montserrat overall.|$|R

5|$|Though exotic birds such as parrots and parakeets {{are also}} found in the Everglades, their impact is negligible. Conversely, perhaps the animal that causes the most damage to native {{wildlife}} is the domestic or feral cat. Across the U.S., cats are responsible for approximately a billion bird deaths annually. They are estimated to number 640 per square mile; cats living in suburban areas have <b>devastating</b> <b>effects</b> on migratory birds and marsh rabbits.|$|E
5|$|After the cyclone has passed, devastation often continues. Standing {{water can}} cause the spread of disease, and {{transportation}} or communication infrastructure may have been destroyed, hampering clean-up and rescue efforts. Nearly two million people have died globally due to tropical cyclones. Despite their <b>devastating</b> <b>effects,</b> tropical cyclones are also beneficial, by potentially bringing rain to dry areas and moving heat from the tropics poleward. Out at sea, ships {{take advantage of their}} known characteristics by navigating through their weaker, western half.|$|E
5|$|The season {{featured}} twelve named {{storms and}} eight of which strengthened into hurricanes. With six of those storms reaching major hurricane intensity, {{this was the}} highest number in a season on record, until being tied in 1933 and 1950 and then being surpassed in 1961. There were several cyclones that brought <b>devastating</b> <b>effects,</b> including the Nassau hurricane, the Louisiana hurricane, the Miami hurricane, and the Havana-Bermuda. Collectively, the storms of this season left over $267.4million in damage and at least 1,554fatalities.|$|E

5|$|A {{high risk}} of severe storms—the first such {{issuance}} since April7, 2006—was issued for {{a large part of}} the Deep South for March1 as the cold front moved eastward. The activity began almost immediately, with several isolated tornadoes taking place that morning across the Mississippi Valley, with one of them leading to the first fatality of the outbreak. Isolated tornadoes were also reported as far north as Illinois, near the center of the low. However, the most intense activity began around noon and continued throughout the afternoon and evening, with southern Alabama and southern Georgia hit the hardest. Nearly continuous supercells formed north of the Gulf of Mexico and produced many tornadoes, some of which hit large population centers with <b>devastating</b> <b>effects.</b> Twenty people were killed by those tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the early}} 1990s, New World Order conspiracism {{was limited to}} two American countercultures, {{primarily}} the militantly anti-government right and secondarily that part of fundamentalist Christianity concerned with the end-time emergence of the Antichrist. Skeptics such as Michael Barkun and Chip Berlet observed that right-wing populist conspiracy theories about a New World Order had not only been embraced by many seekers of stigmatized knowledge but had seeped into popular culture, thereby inaugurating a period during the late 20th and early 21st centuries in the United States where people are actively preparing for apocalyptic millenarian scenarios. Those political scientists are concerned that mass hysteria over New World Order conspiracy theories could eventually have <b>devastating</b> <b>effects</b> on American political life, ranging from escalating lone-wolf terrorism to the rise to power of authoritarian ultranationalist demagogues.|$|E
5|$|Locust plagues {{can have}} <b>devastating</b> <b>effects</b> on human {{population}}s, causing famines and population upheavals. They are mentioned {{in both the}} Koran and the Bible and have also been held responsible for cholera epidemics, resulting from the corpses of locusts drowned in the Mediterranean Sea and decomposing on beaches. The FAO and other organisations monitor locust activity around the world. Timely application of pesticides can prevent nomadic bands of hoppers from forming before dense swarms of adults can build up. Besides conventional control using contact insecticides, biological pest control using the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium acridum, which specifically infects grasshoppers, has been used with some success.|$|E

5|$|Some {{coastal cities}} {{surrendered}} to the Romans which allowed {{them to have a}} base in the coastal regions of Laconia. Gythium was a large city and had been made by the Spartans as their main port and naval arsenal. The Romans advanced upon the city and they were joined there by the combined Rhodian and Pergamese fleets. The sailors from the Roman, Pergamese and Rhodian fleets built siege engines which had <b>devastating</b> <b>effects</b> on the walls. One of the city's joint commanders, Dexagoridas, offered to surrender the city to the Roman legate in charge of the fleet while Flamininus was gone. When the other commander Gorgopas found out he murdered Dexagoridas.|$|E
5|$|Taking {{a similar}} path to Hurricane Fifi four years prior, Greta {{threatened}} {{to reproduce the}} <b>devastating</b> <b>effects</b> of the catastrophic storm; however, damage and loss of life was significantly less than feared. In Honduras, about 1,200homes were damaged, about half of which in towns along the coastline. The storm damaged about 75% of the houses on Roatán along the offshore Bay Islands, {{and there was one}} death in the country. In the Belize Barrier Reef, Greta downed trees and produced high waves, while on the mainland, there was minimal flooding despite a high storm surge. In Dangriga where it made landfall, the hurricane damaged or destroyed 125houses and the primary hospital. In Belize City, a tornado flipped over a truck and damaged four houses. Damage in Belize was estimated at $25million (1978USD), and there were four deaths.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Ms. Edmunds (Zooey Deschanel), Jess' music teacher, {{calls to}} invite {{him on a}} {{one-on-one}} field trip to an art museum. Jess tries to ask his mother's permission; however, she is half-asleep and he takes her mumbling as approval. Jess doesn't ask Leslie to accompany him, and merely looks at her house as they drive by. When he returns home, Jess finds that {{his father and mother}} were worried sick since they didn't know where he was. His father reveals to Jess that Leslie had died that morning while trying to swing across the rain-swollen creek, an allegory for the <b>devastating</b> <b>effects</b> of cheating. Jess, being traumatized by this shocking news, first denies it, then runs out of his house to check on Leslie, but he discovers the emergency vehicles surrounding her house, and {{has no choice but to}} accept Leslie's death.|$|E

5|$|Balaji Sadasivan {{was born}} on 11 July 1955 in Singapore, the son of Indian immigrants. A student at Raffles Institution, Siglap Secondary School (1969–1971) and National Junior College (1972–1973), he {{subsequently}} studied medicine at the University of Singapore. In his second year, he won an essay competition organised by the World Health Organization (WHO) and received the opportunity to attend a healthcare workshop in Minamata, Japan, where he learned about the <b>devastating</b> <b>effects</b> of Minamata disease, a neurological syndrome caused by severe mercury poisoning. This led him to specialise in neurosurgery later on, which was not a popular discipline at the time. In 1979, Sadasivan graduated with a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (M.B.B.S.), {{and two years later}} embarked on further studies at the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow, becoming a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons (F.R.C.S.) in 1984. He trained at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan, between 1985 and 1990, obtaining a diploma from the American Board of Neurology Surgery and becoming a fellow at Harvard University in 1990. He also worked at Brigham and Women's Hospital, a teaching affiliate of Harvard, and at the Children's Hospital Boston in Boston, Massachusetts. In 1997, he obtained a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B. (Hons.)) from the University of London.|$|E
5|$|After Myanmar's {{government}} {{failed to}} respond to the <b>devastating</b> <b>effects</b> of Cyclone Nargis in 2008, officials responded more quickly to the floods and the effects from Komen. Relief supplies were airdropped to marooned villages, assisting the Rohingya people in Rakhine. The government allocated US$1.2million toward supplying farmers with rice paddy seeds to regrow damaged crops. About half of the damaged crop was replanted by November 2015, and in most areas, the grounds remained fertile for future growing. Local businesses donated K2.06billion toward buying supplies, and businessman Aung Ko Win donated US$3.6million. The Myanmar Red Cross, which was already responding to the ongoing flooding, provided additional supplies and assisted with evacuations. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies assisted in these efforts by providing rice and blankets. Volunteers distributed sleeping mats, mosquito nets, medical supplies, and tarps. Various United Nations agencies assisted the residents in displaced camps that were affected further by Komen. Within a month of the storm, the World Food Programme had provided meals to over 450,000people. Food and oil prices rose in the weeks after the floods, and the price of rice reached record levels in the country in August and September 2015. The cost gradually declined after the next rice harvest. To help unemployed farm workers, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation financed a program to pay storm victims to rebuild damaged embankments and restore clean water access. An assessment by the United Nations, the World Bank, and the Myanmar government found that women and children were the worst affected group during and after the disaster, due to the stresses of the damaged houses, and insufficient food and assistance in the subsequent months.|$|E
