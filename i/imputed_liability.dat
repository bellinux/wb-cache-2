40|$|A {{married person}} {{sometimes}} acts solely {{for herself and}} at other times on behalf of her spouse. If she incurs debt solely for herself, then only she is liable to the creditor. If, however, she incurs debt both for herself and on behalf of her spouse, both are liable – the debtor directly and the spouse indirectly by <b>imputed</b> <b>liability.</b> Before married women’s property reform, imputed marital liability followed from marital status. As marriage changed to recognize the legal individuality of both spouses, so too did the scope of a spouse’s <b>imputed</b> <b>liability</b> for the debts of the other spouse. Today, the scope of a spouse’s <b>imputed</b> <b>liability</b> for the debts of an insolvent spouse defines an important and largely unexamined aspect {{of what it means to}} be married. Despite change in the terms of marriage between the parties, courts continue to view imputed marital liability with sensitivity to the historical privilege of marital investment and the unique social value of trust and dependency within marriage...|$|E
40|$|Predatory lending is a real, pervasive, and {{destructive}} problem {{as demonstrated by}} record settlements, jury awards, media exposes, and {{a large body of}} empirical scholarship. Currently the national debate over predatory mortgage lending is shifting to the controversial question of who should bear liability for predatory lending practices. In today’s subprime mortgage market, originators and brokers quickly assign home loans through a complex and opaque series of transactions involving as many as a dozen different strategically organized companies. Loans are typically transferred into large pools, and then income from those loans is “structured” to appeal to different types of investors. This process, usually referred to as securitization, can lower the cost of funds for lenders, allowing them to offer better prices. But, it can also capitalize fly-by-night companies that specialize in fraud, deceptive practices, abusive collections, and other predatory behavior. This article makes three intellectual contributions to this national debate: First, it argues that the current notion of predatory lending has been cast too narrowly. Some of the businesses that sponsor securitization of residential mortgage loans are aware of and capable of preventing mortgage predation. Accordingly, the label “predatory structured finance” is suggested as a necessary addendum to the lexicon of predatory lending. Second, this article tracks the evolution of structured finance of home loans, suggesting that as our financial technology has outpaced consumer protection law, it has effectively deregulated much of the consumer mortgage market. Third, this article argues that the reform strategy favored by many legislators {{and a growing number of}} scholars—assignee liability law— is only a partial solution. While a necessary component of the law, these rules are by themselves inadequate because they excuse many of the most culpable parties from accountability. An efficient legal response to predatory structured finance must include further development in an emerging trend of common law <b>imputed</b> <b>liability</b> theories...|$|E
40|$|This Article {{explores the}} {{historical}} and modern role of marital agency law in defining a critical aspect {{of what it means}} to be married [...] the scope of spouses 2 ̆ 7 <b>imputed</b> <b>liability</b> for each other to third parties. Part II explains how the emergence in the nineteenth century of married women 2 ̆ 7 s legal capacity was driven in part by demand for a reliable legal mechanism to shield assets invested in marriage from the claims of husbands 2 ̆ 7 creditors. Part III considers the scope of marital agency and shared liability under the modern view of marriage as a voluntary partnership among equals, terminable at the will of either. Spouses 2 ̆ 7 financial responsibility for each other to third parties varies widely among jurisdictions. The variety reflects differences in spousal property rights among marital community and non-community property regimes. It also reveals the absence of a consistent theory of the scope of shared risk and reward relative to spouses 2 ̆ 7 individuality within marriage. Part IV offers an explanation for the persistent complexity of the law governing creditors 2 ̆ 7 rights against married people. Even in the context of divorce, in which the partnership metaphor is most robust, we lack consensus on the legal effect of marriage on a couple 2 ̆ 7 s legal relationship with each other. This void complicates not only divorce but also the related question of the scope of spouses 2 ̆ 7 shared responsibility to third party creditors during their marriage. Despite the daunting complexity of marital agency law, it is a mirror of judicial and legislative attitudes about the balance between public and private regulation of intimate relationships. And, it is an undeniably powerful instrument of social policy...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{decisions}} {{handed down}} in various circuits have created virtual chaos {{in predicting the}} liability and damage amounts of insidious disease claims. At least three substantially divergent theories have been adopted to <b>impute</b> <b>liability</b> to the manufacturers of the disease catalysts. Additionally, a new trust fund concept has been used on a limited basis to reconcile differences in court decisions. The trust fund approach is relatively flexible and simple to apply in apportioning damages for insidious disease claims. The author examines and analyzes these three liability theories.

40|$|Investigation {{into the}} modern theory of obligation: from the inadequacies of the German system in terms of {{obstacles}} to properly performed contracts arising typically from frustration and delay down to attempts to pursue remedies. This study investigates the reasons underlying the growth of contractual obligations and examines the system of Schutzpflichten and Nebenpflichten as codified by the Schuldrechtsreform of 2002. It also takes a comparative look at the main issues that the area of obligation and its complex structure now place before legal science – namely, performance, obligations of protection, obligations of sécurité of ‘best effort’ and ‘result’, obligations without performance, social or negotiated contract, protective effects of the contract with regard to third parties, imputation models of liability, and so on. Following a discussion of a possible site for culpa in contrahendo {{in the area of}} contractual liability, the themes of performance ‘not due’ (though explicitly provided for by law) are explored as a source of protection obligations and courtesy relationships within a purely relational paradigm. What emerges from a comparison between French and German law is a contrast between two different conceptions behind obligation – the first one being pluralistic in principle as opposed to the second one being unitary in principle. French law is typified by the «accessory », instrumental and remedial character of obligations of sécurité and a systematic link to the rules of tort law. Under German law, where ‘pure’ or ‘isolated’ obligations for protection are moving towards those emanated from ähnliche geschäftliche Kontakte, the question now is posed as to the division between leistungsbezogene Nebenpflichten and nicht leistungsbezogene Nebenpflichten, with the ultimate purpose of identifying the type of enforceable remedy. Given that a dogmatic, taxonomic approach alone is impractical {{at this stage of the}} enquiry, the author suggests adopting a more practical and workable solution based on the choice of remedy – one which is compensatory or specific in form for contractual performance. In recognizing that these different solutions meet the historical demands and align with the systematic characteristics of each legal system, the author then underlines the phenomena of ‘equivalence’ and ‘symmetry’ behind the regimes of <b>imputed</b> <b>liability</b> in the areas of tort and contract law, in an effort to go beyond a division towards unification along the path that stretches those phenomena from fault to strict liability principles...|$|E
40|$|In this Article, Professor Grover {{argues that}} courts too readily allow {{employers}} to avoid vicarious liability far supervisors 2 ̆ 7 unlawful sexual harassment of subordinates. The Article explores {{the breadth of}} the affirmative defense first introduced in the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s 1998 cases of Faragher v. Boca Raton and Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth. That defense clears an employer of liability for a supervisor 2 ̆ 7 s unlawful sexual harassment if (a) the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior, and (b) the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm otherwise. Because the defense applies only if the harasser takes no tangible employment action against the harassed employee, the meaning ascribed to the 2 ̆ 2 tangible employment action 2 ̆ 2 concept is pivotal. This Article concludes that courts often define the term too narrowly, or simply engage in outcome-based analysis, allowing defendants to invoke the affirmative defense in cases that actually involve tangible employment actions, and thus should not qualify far the defense. After reviewing the history sexual harassment doctrine and of the rules far <b>imputing</b> <b>liability</b> to employers, Professor Grover explains {{the ways in which the}} Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s Ellerth and Faragher decisions resolved some questions about <b>imputing</b> <b>liability</b> for harassment, but created others. She explores the range of meanings courts ascribe to the tangible employment action concept, and suggests that such a broad application of the affirmative defense defeats the purpose of Title VII...|$|R
50|$|The {{doctrine}} of common purpose, common design, joint enterprise, or joint criminal enterprise {{is a common}} law legal doctrine that <b>imputes</b> criminal <b>liability</b> to the participants in a criminal enterprise for all that results from that enterprise. A common application of the rule is to <b>impute</b> criminal <b>liability</b> for wounding a person to participants in a riot who knew, or were reckless as to knowing, {{that one of their}} number had a knife and might use it, {{despite the fact that the}} other participants did not have knives themselves. In England and Wales and certain other Commonwealth countries, this was the understanding of the courts until February 2016, when the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council jointly ruled that it was wrong, and that nothing less than intent to assist the crime would do.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} the redistributive effects of the personal income tax (PIT). Information on the PIT reported in the household survey substantially understates the real tax liability borne by households. The redistributive effects of the personal income tax would be undervalued if the information was used. In order to correct the underestimation of the PIT by non-reporting in our dataset, we apply the tax schedule and <b>impute</b> the tax <b>liability</b> for the individuals in our sample according to the components of their earned income. This <b>imputed</b> tax <b>liability</b> is used to calculate the MT index, the most commonly used measure of the redistributive effects of taxes and governmental subsidies, and to decompose the MT index into the effects of horizontal equity and vertical equity. The MT index and its decomposition show that the personal income tax does reduce inequality, but the effect is small and negligible. The low average personal income tax rate is the main reason why it fails to contribute more to improving inequality. グローバルCOEプログラム = Global COE Progra...|$|R
40|$|A circuit {{split between}} the Second Circuit’s 2014 decision, United States v. Newman, and the Ninth Circuit’s 2015 decision, United States v. Salman, {{illustrates}} problems in insider trading law dating back over thirty years to the Supreme Court’s decision in Dirks v. SEC. Dirks held that when a corporate insider provides information to an outside party who then trades on the information, it must be shown that the insider received some form of a personal benefit for providing the information in order to <b>impute</b> <b>liability.</b> The courts in Newman and Salman disagreed on the sort of evidence that suffices to prove such a personal benefit. As this question is set {{to be decided by}} the Supreme Court, these cases provide an apt opportunity for reexamining the law of insider trading. Although it might be argued that, for both moral and efficiency reasons, the courts in Newman and Salman reached the right outcome, the analysis in both decisions was strained {{as a result of the}} personal benefit requirement first articulated in Dirks. As this Note discusses, this split demonstrates that proof of a personal benefit as an element of insider trading in tipper/tippee cases should not be required, as it creates unnecessarily subjective inquiries into the relationship between the tipper and tippee, resulting in confusion in the boundaries of permissible trading activity. Because insider trading walks a fine line between behavior that should be encouraged (the use of information for legitimate business purposes) and discouraged (exploiting information obtained by virtue of an inside position for personal gain), it is important to more clearly define the bounds of insider trading activity. In place of requiring proof of a personal benefit, this Note argues that a wholly new statutory approach to insider trading is warranted and offers an alternative statutory proposal that may serve as a starting point for a discussion of adopting legislation...|$|R

Unlike the present strategy, the alternative imputation strategy (hereafter referred to as the “alternative strategy”) explicitly accounts for the correlation between assets and liabilities at the household level by supplementing the univariate hot-deck with a joint hot-deck methodology and a model-based methodology referred to as predictive-mean imputation. By blending of both statistical-match and model-based imputation methodology, the alternative strategy represents an intermediate step toward one of the goals of the IAA...|$|R

The paper takes as a starting point a recent Italian ruling that found a master-servant relationship between the Diocesan Curia and parish priest. The Court also held that a parish priest who committed a intentional tort (sexual assault), causally connected to the relationship, is acting within the scope of employment, so that the Diocesan Curia is vicariously liable. The Author suggests a comparative approach to the guidelines of Belgian and American case law on the subject of sexual abuse committed by clergy and examines the legal aspects of the topic as they are ruled by Italian law, which should lead to reject the conclusion of <b>imputing</b> a vicarious <b>liability</b> upon the Diocesan Curia.
