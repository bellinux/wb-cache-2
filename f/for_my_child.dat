2500|$|In August 2010, she {{was criticized}} after saying that {{breastfeeding}} should be law. She told Harper's Bazaar UK, [...] "Some people here [...] think they don't have to breastfeed, and I think 'Are {{you going to}} give chemical food to your child when they are so little?'...I think there should be a worldwide law, in my opinion, that mothers should breastfeed their babies for six months." [...] Bündchen later posted a statement on her blog saying, [...] "My intention in making a comment about the importance of breastfeeding {{has nothing to do with}} the law. It comes from my passionate beliefs about children. Being a new mom has brought a lot of questions. I feel like I am in a constant search for answers on what might be the best <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>child.</b> It's unfortunate that in an interview sometimes things can seem so black and white." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the topic}} of Sheila and Lauren's [...] "cat fights", Brown said: [...] "People like cat fights because we {{can get away with}} what you can't get away with in {{everyday}} life. You're living vicariously through me. There might be someone that [...] you just might want to put it to someday, and you can't, but you can turn on the TV and see Sheila do it, and get away with it. Being mean and evil and fighting {{and by the end of}} the day, you're spent." [...] On {{the topic of}} Sheila [...] "terrorizing" [...] both Genoa City and Los Angeles while on both soaps, Brown said: [...] "You know, I came to L.A. to start a new life. And well they just didn't make it that easy for me, did they? So I might've shot a gun once or twice again, but it wasn't my fault. You know what, people get what they deserve, they really do. I might've poisoned someone by accident, but he never should've talked to me like that. You just don't do that. Anyway, people get what they deserve, and I think a lot of them have what's coming to them, and I'm not sure I'm done yet." [...] About Sheila's personality, Brown said: [...] "Sheila's just evil. There's nothing bitchy about what she does, [...] it's very straightforward. She's manipulative but never in a bitchy way, in a way to get things accomplished, and get things done the way she wants to. When being nice and being diplomatic and when being all those things don't work any longer, she snaps." [...] On Sheila's relationship with Stephanie Forrester, Brown said: [...] "Stephanie made my life miserable. So anyway, I shot Stephanie. I did. Stephanie felt she could be a better provider <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>child</b> than I could. And you know what, you don't keep a mother like Sheila away from her child, you just don't do that. And Stephanie couldn't stop me." [...] Brown also added that, [...] "To be a good villain, you have to make the character real for you." ...|$|E

It was good-feeling in Cheenbuk that made him care <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>child,</b> and treat her well, and bring her back here to her mother and her tribe. It was good-feeling in the Eskimos that made them kind to the Indian chief, and receive him hospitably, when they might have taken his scalp and kept his daughter.

'I {{should not}} allow,' said Mr. Spenlow, with an evident {{increase}} of pious sentiment, and slowly {{shaking his head}} as he poised himself upon his toes and heels alternately, 'my suitable provision <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>child</b> to be influenced by a piece of youthful folly like the present.

[...] "It would have been such a position <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>child!</b> And that young man,--without a shilling in the world; and writing in that way, just for bare bread!"

It killed her, and she was the fastest worker in the shop. I have thought about it often, and I know. That is why I cannot work in the shop. The machine bothers my head.
