In general, the automation of enforcement has numerous challenges, including the detection of events, gathering forensic evidence surrounding the event, maintaining the security and provenance of the records, and conducting adjudication {{that is consistent with}} the extant rights structure [2]. To illustrate this challenge, Shay et. al. [3] conducted a simple experiment surrounding the enforcement of traffic laws. One of the “Grand Challenges” in spectrum sharing that was identified by leading researchers was automating the enforcement of spectrum sharing. In general, the automation of enforcement has numerous challenges, including the detection of events, gathering forensic evidence surrounding the event, maintaining the security and provenance of the records, and conducting adjudication that is consistent with the extant rights structure. This work will be looking at the enforcement aspect in the spectrum sharing regime, especially on <b>ex-post</b> <b>enforcement</b> by using Block-chain technology to automate the <b>ex-post</b> <b>enforcement</b> processes. The potential usages can be divided into three applications which are <b>ex-post</b> <b>enforcement</b> using Block-chain by itself as Publicly-Distributed-Database, <b>ex-post</b> <b>enforcement</b> using Smart Contract, <b>ex-post</b> <b>enforcement</b> as Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO...|$|E
40|$|Spectrum sharing is {{emerging}} as a key strategy for future wireless communications systems. Enforcement is a requirement for spectrum sharing to protect the incumbent of the spectrum from bad interference. Practical schemes have linked together ex-ante and <b>ex-post</b> <b>enforcement.</b> The design of the overall enforcement system may give more emphasis to one or the other. The emphasis in commercial-government sharing in the United States has been on ex-ante measures [4, 5]. Determining the role of <b>ex-post</b> <b>enforcement</b> in a spectrum sharing scheme is of significant importance since spectrum sharing will inevitably result in interference events. To evaluate {{the role of the}} <b>ex-post</b> <b>enforcement</b> approach, we will consider numerical examples where we compare the cost of the ex-post only enforcement to the cost of the ex-ante only enforcement on one of the suggested bands for spectrum sharing (1695 - 1710 MHz). The cost of the <b>ex-post</b> <b>enforcement</b> in our model depends on the penalty value that Primary User (PU) uses to control interference events and the probability of detecting the interference. The penalty value depends on two factors which are changeable and unchangeable enforcement costs. The cost of the ex-post only enforcement has two variables that affect it, which are probability of detection; and the changeable enforcement cost. The numerical results show how these two variables affect one another, and their effect on the radius of th...|$|E
40|$|Cooperative Spectrum sharing can {{be thought}} of as a {{reorganization}} of rights between stakeholders [2]. The principal stakeholders are the Primary User (PU), who holds the spectrum license, and the Secondary User(s) who uses the spectrum temporarily. Any rights management system requires a set of strategies and technologies to enforce the rights [3]; the timing of the enforcement action (ex-ante and ex-post) also plays a significant role [4]. The cooperative spectrum sharing approaches that have been proposed by the NTIA emphasize ex-ante actions, which are designed to prevent a PU’s signal from harmful interference that could occur by the SU [1, 5]. A comprehensive enforcement framework would include protecting the rights of the SU in addition to having an ex post component that can efficiently and effectively adjudicate claims of interference. Determining the role of <b>ex-post</b> <b>enforcement</b> in a spectrum sharing scheme is of significant importance since cooperative spectrum sharing will without doubt result in interference events. To evaluate the role of the <b>ex-post</b> <b>enforcement</b> approach, a hypothetical scenario of using the recommended protection zones and the involved entities will be used to analyze the current enforcement timing measures and to evaluate the usage of ex-post-only enforcement measures. The hypothetical scenario concerns about the behaviors of the SUs, if SU-mobile devices transmitting near PU-base station or transmitting with high power signal within the protection zone. This behavior will cause harmful interference to the PU signal and data received by the PU will be lost. To guarantee SU behavior the suggested ex-ante and <b>ex-post</b> <b>enforcement</b> measures will be explained and analyzed. Then, ex-post-only enforcement measures will be applied to this scenario and analyzed. The purpose of analyzing the ex-post-only enforcement measures is to evaluate how these measures might work, and what the limits are on their effectiveness...|$|E

Regulators for electricity markets apparently respond to differences in underlying market structure and design features when choosing between ex-ante (that is, rule-based) behavioral restrictions as opposed to <b>ex-post</b> <b>enforcement</b> (that is, investigations and sanctions) as the principal means for deterring abuses of market power. Particular design features that influence market-monitoring policies are whether the market is one-part (energy only) versus two-part (energy and capacity), and whether there is centralized or bilateral trading.

40|$|The {{power to}} enforce rights and {{obligations}} in a society is essential. For simplicity, economists have focused on two extreme forms of enforcement: perfect <b>ex-post</b> <b>enforcement</b> of contracts by an exogenous un-modeled authority (a ``court'') or contracts that are ``self-enforcing. '' Models that assume perfect <b>ex-post</b> <b>enforcement</b> have focused on ability to pay [...] a borrower fails to repay only when assets are below the promised amount. Otherwise, the borrower honors the promise. In contrast, when judicial enforcement is not possible the problem of willingness to pay arises. We consider the intermediate case where enforcement is possible, but not all assets can be seized. In this case the twin problems of ability and willingness to pay arise. We model enforcement as a technology with two key parameters. (i) The efficiency of enforcement is the cost paid to secure rights in court. This cost varies across countries due to different institutions (e. g., legal and accounting systems and corruption). (ii) Creditor protection is the percentage of total assets that a court can seize; debtor protection is the remainder. The amount of protection is determined by {{factors such as the}} level of exemptions permitted by the bankruptcy code, inflation, the length of bankruptcy proceedings, and the debtor's ability to ``hide'' assets. The paper provides a complete characterization of the effect of these enforcement parameters on the contract interest rate and the bankruptcy probability. The most striking result is that the enforcement parameters have a highly non-linear influence on firm finance. The theoretical characterization and quantitative analysis show that for some parameter values finance is not sensitive to the legal structure. For other values, after a critical threshold is reached, finance is severely compromised. The paper provides a (positive) theory with quantitative implications that can explain the observed relationship between legal systems and firm finance. We take the legal system as given and consider the opportunity to relieve firm distress by both liquidation and renegotiation. In the U. S. there are five types of bankruptcy. We focus on Chapter 7, often called liquidation. When bankruptcy occurs under Chapter~ 7, the debtor gives up all non-exempt property owned at the time the bankruptcy petition is filed. If the court grants a discharge, the debtor is not liable for any other pre-bankruptcy debts and no claims can be made against future earnings. Thus, Chapter 7 simultaneously liquidates all non-exempt assets for the benefit of creditors and protects the insolvent debtor. We model this protection via parameter eta and the cost of enforcement by c. Underlying the computable contract problem is a dynamic game with incomplete information and our stylized description of the enforcement technology. In the initial period the entrepreneur and lender share common beliefs about the possible returns from a risky investment project. The realization is the entrepreneur's private information unless costly bankruptcy occurs. We explicitly model agents' sequential decisions. First, agents write a contract. Next, the entrepreneur has the opportunity to default or to voluntarily make a contract payment. The lender then optimally chooses whether to request enforcement, given the information revealed by the entrepreneur's default decision. Finally, agents have rational expectations in the sense that all decisions are time consistent. Limited commitment is an essential feature of the model because the lender can revise the enforcement strategy after information is revealed by the entrepreneur's default decision. This leads to a sharp non-linearity in firm finance with respect to enforcement costs. The model also distinguishes between default and bankruptcy. Default means that the borrower (optimally) chooses not to make a payment. If default occurs, the lender then (optimally) chooses whether to invoke bankruptcy proceedings to liquidate the firm. We show how the legal code affects agents' incentives to default and pursue bankruptcyenforcement...|$|E
