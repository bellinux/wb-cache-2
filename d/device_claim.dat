40|$|The {{field of}} {{energetic}} medicine began generations ago when medical doctors and scientists found an electrical correlate for what Rheinold Voll described, in the Nineteen Fifties, as medication testing on meridian points. These points showed electrical variability through resistance {{when a patient}} was exposed to various homoeopathically prepared substances. William Nelson, the developer of the Quantum Xrroid Consciousness Interface (QXCI) Device, calls this phenomenon electrophysiological reactivity. The developers of the QXCI <b>device</b> <b>claim</b> that the QXCI is able to connect deeply with the energies and tissues of the patient’s body, mind and spirit and test his or her reactions or “reactivity” to over eight thousand items. The QXCI then offers a wealth of software programs that make suggestions from many different modalities on balancing and reintegrating the body, mind and spirit of the patient. The QXCI device and software claims to analyse and balance stresses of many types including: toxicity, trauma, deficiency, perverse energy, pathogens, allergy, heredity and mental factors (Nelson, 2003). The results of research published by Nelson (1994 b) and Nagy (1994 b) showed {{that there was a}} correlation of over eighty percent between QXCI reactivity readings and conventional diagnostic tests and analysis for various infections and blood chemicals. As a result of this research the QXCI is recommended by the developers as a useful pre-diagnostic screen. The study aimed to determine whether there was any correlation between prediagnosed malaria, tuberculosis and diabetes mellitus subjects and QXCI reactivity readings. Reactivity readings were taken of twenty healthy individuals and twenty prediagnosed malaria, tuberculosis and diabetes mellitus subjects. Reactivity readings were analysed for increased reactivity to Plasmodium, Mycobacterium and glucose. Results showed no significant statistical relationship between the conventional diagnostic tests for malaria, tuberculosis and diabetes mellitus and the QXCI vi reactivity readings. The Predictive Value Theory tests of Sensitivity, Specificity and Efficiency as well as the Chi-Square Test were used to obtain statistical results. The results are not conclusive and further investigation into the use of the QXCI as a pre-diagnostic tool is required. Dr. M. R. A. Moiloa Dr. J. L. Du Plessi...|$|E
