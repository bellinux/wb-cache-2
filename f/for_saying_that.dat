5|$|The comedian {{has said}} that he likes playing weak characters, and {{particularly}} revealing weaknesses in high status figures. During the course of the show, he will frequently peel back the Colbert character's apparent bravado to expose a very weak inner core. In one instance, Colbert demands one of his staff members subject him to simulated waterboarding, only to break down into pleas for mercy upon hearing a water bottle cap popped. In another episode, he criticizes The Today Show cohost Matt Lauer <b>for</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> it's unacceptable for men to cry, only to sob hysterically upon learning that Katie Couric has left the show. These status shifts occur commonly, and constitute a central component of the show's comedy.|$|E

Whitman subsequently apologized, and voiced her opposition to attempts by Congressional Republicans to bar unwed teenage mothers from receiving welfare payments.|$|E
25|$|He {{was accused}} of being 'a vexer of two parishes with continual suits of law'. This may mean that he {{resisted}} the demands of visitation articles in reference to ceremonial observance. An Oxford pamphlet of 1648 is Wood's authority <b>for</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> he was 'looked upon by the high commission as one guilty of adultery'. It is plain {{that there was no}} evidence to substantiate the charge.|$|E
25|$|Stoiber, as a {{minister}} {{in the state of}} Bavaria, was widely known for advocating a {{reduction in the number of}} asylum seekers Germany accepts, something that prompted critics to label him xenophobic, anti-Turkish and anti-Islam. In the late 1990s he criticized the incoming Chancellor Schröder <b>for</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> he would work hard in the interest of Germans and people living in Germany. Stoiber's remarks drew heavy criticism in the press.|$|E
5000|$|Martin Luther King, Jr. {{often used}} the phrase [...] "drum major {{instinct}}," [...] meaning the instinct to be a leader. In his sermon at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, Georgia, on February 4, 1968 he said: [...] "If you want to <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I was a drum major, <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I was a drum major <b>for</b> justice, <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I was a drum major <b>for</b> peace, <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I was a drum major for righteousness.

They also say that the Iglesia ni Cristo fallaciously misinterprets Biblical passages in order to suit their doctrines.|$|E
25|$|The media's main {{criticism}} of Reagan centered on his gaffes. When Carter kicked-off his general election campaign in Tuscumbia, Reagan—referring to the Southern US as a whole—claimed that Carter had begun his {{campaign in the}} birthplace of the Ku Klux Klan. In doing so, Reagan seemed to insinuate that the KKK represented the South, which caused many Southern governors to denounce Reagan's remarks. Additionally, Reagan was widely ridiculed by Democrats <b>for</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> trees caused pollution; he later said that he meant only certain types of pollution and his remarks had been misquoted.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 Hodge was {{transferred}} to Minister of State in the Department for Work and Pensions with primary responsibility for Work. On 17 June 2005 she was criticised <b>for</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> the former workers of MG Rover {{would be able to}} obtain jobs at Tesco, a local supermarket. Later, she claimed that this was not what she meant, rather that she had empathy for those losing their jobs, and was pointing to a new Tesco supermarket as an example of new jobs being created {{in the face of the}} redundancies at the car manufacturing plant.|$|E

On 12 February 1420 proceedings were begun before him against William Taylor, priest, {{who had been}} for fourteen years excommunicated for heresy, and was now degraded and burnt <b>for</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> prayers {{ought not to be}} addressed to saints, but only to God. A striking contrast was exhibited in October 1424, when a Stamford friar, John Russell, who had preached that any religious potest concumbere cum muliere and not mortally sin, was sentenced only to retract his doctrine.|$|E
25|$|Augustine of Hippo (354 – 430), Cyril of Alexandria (c. 376–444), and Pope Leo I (c. 400–461). In the 7th century, Saint Maximus the Confessor (c. 580 – 662) {{declared}} it wrong to make accusations against the Romans <b>for</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> the Holy Spirit proceeds {{also from the}} Son, since the Romans were able to cite the unanimous support of the Latin Fathers and a statement by Saint Cyril of Alexandria. Apart from those already mentioned, these Latin Fathers included Saints Faustus of Riez (died between 490 and 495), Gennadius of Massilia (died c. 496), Avitus of Vienne (c. 470 – 523), Fulgentius of Ruspe (462 or 467 – 527 or 533), and Isidore of Seville (died 636).|$|E
25|$|The iPlayer {{received}} {{the approval of}} the BBC Trust on 30 April 2007, and an open beta for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 was launched at midnight on 27 July 2007, where it was announced that only a fixed number of people would be able to sign up for the service, with a controlled increase in users over the summer. The BBC had been criticised <b>for</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> the iPlayer would 'launch' on 27 July 2007, when what was on offer was simply an extension of the beta to an open beta, admitting more users in a controlled manner. This was done reportedly to allow British ISPs and the BBC to gauge the effect of the iPlayer traffic on the Internet within the UK.|$|E

25|$|Exploding Snap is a wizarding {{card game}} in which the cards spontaneously explode during games. The game is popular with Hogwarts students. In Chamber of Secrets, Harry and Ron are held back from {{investigating}} why spiders were fleeing Hogwarts because Fred and George delayed them with this game. Ron later singed his eyebrows while building a card house with Exploding Snap cards. In Order of the Phoenix, Lee Jordan is punished by Dolores Umbridge <b>for</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> she cannot tell them off for playing this game, {{as one of her}} Educational Decrees states that teachers can only talk to students about the subjects they are paid to teach. In Cursed Child Ginny remembers playing this game with Harry following the events of Chamber of Secrets and notes that it helped her to recover from the trauma (all the other students avoided her after learning the truth).|$|E

The broadcast on ITV in January 2002 and its promotion did not pass without incident; he was criticised by Unionists <b>for</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> Protestants in Northern Ireland felt [...] "a collective guilt" [...] over the killings. His parents' home was also vandalised and he received death threats. During the awards season, Nesbitt won the British Independent Film Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a British Independent Film and was nominated for the British Academy Television Award for Best Actor. The film was also screened at film festivals such as the Stockholm International Film Festival, where Nesbitt was presented with the Best Actor award.|$|E

500|$|Frick and Gary {{traveled}} overnight {{by train}} to the White House to implore Roosevelt {{to set aside}} {{the application of the}} Sherman Antitrust Act and allow—before the market opened—a company that already held a 60% share of the steel market to make a large acquisition. Roosevelt's secretary refused to see them, but Frick and Gary convinced James Rudolph Garfield, the Secretary of the Interior, to bypass the secretary and arrange a meeting with the president. With less than an hour before the Stock Exchange opened, Roosevelt and Secretary of State Elihu Root began to review the proposed takeover and appreciate the crash likely to ensue if the merger was not approved. Roosevelt relented; he later recalled of the meeting, [...] "It was necessary for me to decide on the instant before the Stock Exchange opened, for the situation in New York was such that any hour might be vital. I do not believe that anyone could justly criticize me <b>for</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> I would not feel like objecting to the purchase under those circumstances". When news reached New York, confidence soared. The Commercial & Financial Chronicle reported that [...] "the relief furnished by this transaction was instant and far-reaching". The final crisis of the panic had been averted.|$|E
