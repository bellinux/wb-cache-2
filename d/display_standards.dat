50|$|Various {{computer}} <b>display</b> <b>standards</b> or display modes {{have been}} used {{in the history of the}} personal computer. They are often a combination of aspect ratio (specified as width-to-height ratio), display resolution (specified as the width and height in pixels), color depth (measured in bits per pixel), and refresh rate (expressed in hertz). Associated with the screen resolution and refresh rate is a display adapter. Earlier display adapters were simple frame-buffers, but later <b>display</b> <b>standards</b> also specified a more extensive set of display functions and software controlled interface.|$|E

50|$|For example, a VGA-signal, {{which is}} created by the display controller, is being transported over a VGA-cable to the display. Both ends of the cable end in a VGA connector. Laptops and other mobile {{computers}} use different interfaces between the display controller and the display. A display controller usually supports multiple computer <b>display</b> <b>standards.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Hercules Graphics Card (HGC) is a {{computer}} graphics controller made by Hercules Computer Technology, Inc. that combines IBM's text-only MDA <b>display</b> <b>standard</b> with a bitmapped graphics mode. This allows the HGC to offer both high quality text and graphics from a single card. The HGC was very popular, and became a widely supported de facto <b>display</b> <b>standard</b> on IBM PC compatibles connected to a monochrome monitor. The HGC standard was used long after more technically capable systems had entered the market, especially on dual-monitor setups.|$|R

50|$|Most of {{the initial}} range of PS/2 models were {{equipped}} with a new frame buffer known as the Video Graphics Array, or VGA for short. This effectively replaced the previous EGA standard. VGA increased graphics memory to 256 KB and provided for resolutions of 640×480 with 16 colors, and 320×200 with 256 colors. VGA also provided a palette of 262,144 colors (as opposed to the EGA palette of 64 colors). The IBM 8514 and later XGA computer <b>display</b> <b>standards</b> were also introduced on the PS/2 line.|$|E
5000|$|The {{interface}} {{is designed}} to transmit uncompressed digital video and can be configured to support multiple modes such as DVI-A (analog only), DVI-D (digital only) or DVI-I (digital and analog). Featuring support for analog connections, the DVI specification {{is compatible with the}} VGA interface. This compatibility, along with other advantages, led to its widespread acceptance over competing digital <b>display</b> <b>standards</b> Plug and Display (P&D) and Digital Flat Panel (DFP). [...] Although DVI is predominantly associated with computers, it is sometimes used in other consumer electronics such as television sets and DVD players.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} common resolutions {{have been used}} with {{computers}} descended from the original IBM PC. Some of these are now supported by other families of personal computers. These are de facto standards, usually originated by one manufacturer and reverse-engineered by others, though the VESA group has co-ordinated the efforts of several leading video display adapter manufacturers. Video standards associated with IBM-PC-descended personal computers are shown in the diagram and table below, alongside those of early Macintosh and other makes for comparison. (From the early 1990s onwards, most manufacturers moved over to PC <b>display</b> <b>standards</b> thanks to widely available and affordable hardware).|$|E
50|$|WQUXGA (Wide Quad Ultra Extended Graphics Array) {{describes}} a <b>display</b> <b>standard</b> that supports {{a resolution of}} 3840×2400 pixels, which provides a 16:10 aspect ratio. This resolution is exactly four times 1920×1200 (in pixels).|$|R

5000|$|The WebObjects Framework (WOF) is at {{the highest}} level of the system. It is {{responsible}} for the application's user interface and state management. It uses a template-based approach to take that object graph and turn it into HTML, or other tag-based information <b>display</b> <b>standards,</b> such as XML or SMIL. It provides an environment where you can use and create reusable components. Components are chunks of presentation (HTML) and functionality (Java code) often with a parameter list to enhance reusability. WebObjects Builder is used to create the HTML-templates and creates the [...]wod-file linking, for instance, a Java String object to interface objects like an input field in a web form.|$|E
50|$|Though {{punctuation}} and the alphanumeric symbols can {{be considered}} standard in most text modes, many of them contain additional symbols and variant attributes (colours, blinking, lines / columns per screen, etc.) that differ between operating environments: the text mode of a Commodore 64 would be substantially {{different from that of}} an IBM PC, though despite an absence of standardization in the text display (until implementation of later text mode terminal <b>display</b> <b>standards</b> such as VT100 and ANSI), they would both be considered to be text modes. These later standards also contain numerous characters, largely blocks and lines, specifically intended to be used for fast, low-bandwidth display of crude block graphics in the text mode.|$|E
50|$|The 2.x {{version of}} HDCP {{is not a}} {{continuation}} of HDCPv1, and is rather a completely different link protection. Version 2.x employs industry-standard encryption algorithms, such as 128-bit AES with 3072 or 1024-bit RSA public key and 256-bit HMAC-SHA256 hash function. While all of the HDCP v1.x specifications support backwards compatibility to previous versions of the specification, HDCPv2 devices may interface with HDCPv1 hardware only by natively supporting HDCPv1, or by using a dedicated converter device. As a result, there is currently no deployment plan for v2 to replace v1 in existing systems. This means that HDCPv2 {{is only applicable to}} new technologies. It has been selected for the WirelessHD and Miracast (formerly WiFi <b>Display)</b> <b>standards.</b>|$|E
