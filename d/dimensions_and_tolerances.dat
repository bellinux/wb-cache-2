50|$|Tolerance stackups or {{tolerance}} stacks {{are used}} to describe the problem-solving process in mechanical engineering of calculating the effects of the accumulated variation that is allowed by specified <b>dimensions</b> <b>and</b> <b>tolerances.</b> Typically these <b>dimensions</b> <b>and</b> <b>tolerances</b> are specified on an engineering drawing. Arithmetic tolerance stackups use the worst-case maximum or minimum values of <b>dimensions</b> <b>and</b> <b>tolerances</b> to calculate the maximum and minimum distance (clearance or interference) between two features or parts. Statistical tolerance stackups evaluate the maximum and minimum values based on the absolute arithmetic calculation combined with some method for establishing likelihood of obtaining the maximum and minimum values, such as Root Sum Square (RSS) or Monte-Carlo methods.|$|E
