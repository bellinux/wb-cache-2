40|$|On February 4, 2011, {{the first}} {{roundtable}} of the ITO took {{place under the}} auspices of the RSC at EUI in Fiesole, Florence. Participants critically discussed the current observed deadlocks in the Doha Round of multilateral trade negotiations, and advanced some preliminary thoughts on the way out. The group discussions were presided by Josep Borrell, the President of EUI, and led in the morning by Rufus Yerxa (Deputy Director General at the WTO), who provided an overall assessment of the issues that emerge as ‘ground-stoppers’ at this stage. In the <b>follow</b> <b>up,</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussion</b> was divided equally between four speakers: Michael Punke, the Ambassador of the United States to the WTO, gave the US perspective on the round; Lu Xiankun, the First Secretary in the Permanent Delegation of the Peoples’ Republic of China, explained the position of its country on what needs to be done to wrap up the round; Signe Ratso, Director for WTO Affairs at the European Commission, gave the European Union (EU) perspective, and finally, Vital Moreira, Head of the International Trade Committee of the European Parliament provided the reaction of the European citizenry on what is being discussed in Geneva. The discussions during the morning session concentrated on the current agenda of the Doha Round. Miguel Maduro, Director of the Global Governance Programme, acted as overall discussant. In the afternoon, there were presentations by five academics and the focus was equally distributed to the current- as well as a more ‘normative’ agenda that should eventually occupy the minds of trade negotiators: André Sapir (ULB) focused on the institutional design of the WTO and asked whether, in its current form, it can do justice to the new emerging issues; he drew a parallel between the multilateral- and the preferential agenda (as evidenced in the many preferential trade agreements that have recently seen the light of the day) and, noting the discrepancy, he asked whether it is time for the WTO to rethink its mandate if it is to continue to be policy relevant for its membership. Patrick Messerlin (Sciences Po) discussed the ‘old’ and the ‘new’ agenda as is, and as it should have been negotiated in the current round. He observed that key issues in the old agenda have largely remained outside the realm of current negotiations, whereas the progress in new issues does not even match de facto practiced liberalization: he used practice and offers in the services sector to illustrate this last point. He went on to state that one should not attach too many hopes on negotiating topics that have been hailed as innovative and meeting the aspirations of developing countries (such as the Aid for Trade initiative) for, in all likelihood, they will fall short of addressing actual needs. Henrik Horn (IFN), and Petros C. Mavroidis (Columbia & Neuchâtel) presented a short paper on the negotiations regarding dispute settlement. In their view, some of the issues currently on the agenda are quite important and deserve their inclusion in the talks. They remarked nonetheless, that progress has been made on peripheral issues, while discussion on key issues has so far been confined to little if any progress. They further regret that, the mounting criticism regarding the quality and internal consistency of reports (judgments) notwithstanding, negotiators did not find it opportune to include agency design in their discussions. Ernst-Ulrich Petersmann (EUI) asked the question whether the single undertaking-approach, whereby WTO Members accept to be party to (almost) all agreements concluded during a trade round should continue to be practiced in the future. He advanced both conceptual- and Realpolitik considerations to cast doubt to this perspective. He goes as far as to argue that even in the approach is followed at the end of the current round, there are reasons to believe that implementing efforts will not do justice to a similar commitment. This is the first of our Trade Policy Briefs that we will be circulating at the end of Chatham House rules-inspired conferences at the premises of RSC at EUI. Our aim is to bring together on regular basis a group of academics and policy makers to discuss the multilateral trade agenda as it emerges and evolves. The Doha round is going through tough times and at this stage it is impossible to predict its outcome. This is the central message coming from the meeting held on February 4, 2011 at EUI (RSCAS). For reasons having to do with domestic political economy, but also the inability to adjust to the emerging multi-polar reality, negotiators find it hard to come to grips with whatever is required to conclude the round. The most problematic feature is the absence of a Plan B: what do in case current design of talks fails to deliver? Maybe it is time to rethink ambitions and strategies, while accepting that an imminent conclusion has become a remote possibility. Introductory Remarks, Petros C.

When the two-volume work was published on 17 January 1997 it confirmed that the nuclear-armed flights over Greenland were recurrent, but that the United States had acted in good faith. The report blamed Danish Prime Minister H. C.

40|$|AbstractThe present {{paper is}} an {{extension}} of the study published by Radomir and Nistor, 2012 and aims to compare the scale proposed by the two authors (revised SSTQUAL) to the one previously developed by Lin and Hsieh, 2011. The original SSTQUAL scale, as developed by Lin and Hsieh in 2011, is intended to measure the quality of services offered via alternative distribution channels across contexts. One year later, Radomir and Nistor adapt the scale to the banking context and argue that the revised SSTQUAL scale may better reflect Romanian customers’ perceptions regarding the quality of services offered through delivery channels such as ATMs, Internet Banking or Mobile Banking. Hence, this paper is organized in five main sections. The introduction only briefly underlines the differences in the two scales under comparison. The second section describes the questionnaire design, data collection and data analysis processes.

40|$|Abstract (200 words) Although deeply {{ingrained}} in {{the economics of}} professional team sports literature, previous research could not confirm the importance of outcome uncertainty in European professional football. Moreover, a negative effect was detected and explained rather controversially: It is argued {{that the majority of}} spectators prefer to see the home team play either a much inferior team or a rather successful team. With data of n= 306 matches in the German Bundesliga, a generalized Tobit estimator with individual cut-off points and error terms clustered by home teams is employed to <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> with <b>the</b> <b>discussion</b> on <b>the</b> (un) importance of outcome uncertainty. The results highlight a significant positive effect on attendance when either the home and/or the away team still have a theoretical chance to win the championship while the suggested importance of teams still having the possibility to qualify for the UEFA Champions League is not supported (medium-term uncertainty). Furthermore, in line with previous research we could detect a negative effect of short-term uncertainty. However, while {{there is no evidence that}} spectators prefer the home team to play an inferior team, the results suggest that it is rather a strong brand of the away team which rises attendance figures in the German Bundesliga.

This study looks closer at how parents of seriously ill children have experienced being involved in CEC discussions. Methods Ten next of kin of six seriously ill children were interviewed. Their cases were discussed in two CECs between April of 2011 and March of 2014. The main ethical dilemma was limitation of life-prolonging treatment. Health care personnel who could elucidate the case were also present in <b>the</b> <b>discussion.</b> <b>The</b> interviewer observed each discussion and then interviewed the next of kin shortly after the meeting, following a structured interview guide. Results All next of kin emphasized {{that it had been}} important for them {{to be present}}. They stressed the important role of the CEC chair and appreciated that their case was discussed in a systematic way. Some next of kin appreciated that the child’s impending death was discussed openly, and believed that this would facilitate their future grieving. Having had an opportunity to hear all the arguments behind the decision to be made would probably help them to accept the road ahead. All of them felt that they were taken seriously and listened to.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an initial challenge {{to tackle the}} every so "tricky" points encountered when dealing with energy accounting, and thereafter illustrates how such a system of accounting can be used when assessing for the metabolic changes in societies. The paper is divided in four main sections. The first three, present a general <b>discussion</b> on <b>the</b> main issues encountered when conducting energy analyses. The last section, subsequently, combines this heuristic approach to the actual formalization of it, in quantitative terms, {{for the analysis of}} possible energy scenarios. Section one covers the broader issue of how to account for the relevant categories used when accounting for Joules of energy; emphasizing on the clear distinction between Primary Energy Sources (PES) (which are the physical exploited entities that are used to derive useable energy forms (energy carriers)) and Energy Carriers (EC) (the actual useful energy that is transmitted for the appropriate end uses within a society). Section two sheds light on the concept of Energy Return on Investment (EROI). Here, it is emphasized that, there must already be a certain amount of energy carriers available to be able to extract/exploit Primary Energy Sources to thereafter generate a net supply of energy carriers. It is pointed out that this current trend of intense energy supply has only been possible to the great use and dependence on fossil energy. Section three <b>follows</b> <b>up</b> on <b>the</b> <b>discussion</b> of EROI, indicating that a single numeric indicator such as an output/input ratio is not sufficient in assessing for the performance of energetic systems. Rather an integrated approach that incorporates (i) how big the net supply of Joules of EC can be, given an amount of extracted PES (the external constraints); (ii) how much EC needs to be invested to extract an amount of PES; and (iii) the power level that it takes for both processes to succeed, is underlined. Section four, ultimately, puts the theoretical concepts at play, assessing for how the metabolic performances of societies can be accounted for within this analytical framework...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Coronary {{artery disease}} {{is the leading}} cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes. Screening for asymptomatic coronary artery disease with treatment by means of revascularization seems to be an appealing option for prevention. The utility of such a strategy has never been challenged in a randomized trial. Methods/Design In the present study a cohort of diabetic patients without any symptoms and without known coronary artery disease will be screened at two diabetes outpatients services. Those with intermediate or high risk (equal or greater than 10 % according to the Italian risk chart) will be asked to participate and enrolled. They will be seen and followed in order to provide the best adherence to medical therapy. Half of the patients will be randomized to undergo an exercise tolerance testing while the other group will continue to be regularly seen at diabetes outpatients services. Best medical/behavioral therapy will be offered to both groups. Those patients with a positive exercise tolerance testing will be studied by coronary angiography and treated according to the severity of coronary lesions by percutaneous stenting or surgery. The objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of the screening strategy aimed at revascularization. A cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed at the end of <b>the</b> <b>follow</b> <b>up.</b> <b>Discussion</b> <b>The</b> study will provide useful information about prevention and treatment of diabetic patients at high risk of coronary events. It will be made clearer if detection of silent coronary artery disease has to be recommended and followed by treatment. Given the simplicity of the study protocol, it will be easily transferable to the real world. Trial registration (ClinicalTrials. gov) : NCT 00547872 </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the derivational morphology of the Akan language with particular focus on verbal nominalization through affixation (particularly prefixation). There {{are two ways}} through which this nominalization process can be realized in the Asante-Twi dialect of Akan. These are direct verb stem/base nominalization and nominalization after reduplication. The main {{difference between the two}} nominalization processes is shown to be that while in the former process, the nominal prefixes adjoin the verb stem directly to derive nominals, in the latter process, the same prefixation process also applies but after the reduplication process. I first discuss direct verb nominalization through prefixation and <b>follow</b> it <b>up</b> with <b>the</b> <b>discussion</b> of <b>the</b> nominalization process that takes place after reduplication has applied. We observe {{that in the case of}} the latter process, sometimes the nominal prefix adjoins another prefix; the reduplicative prefix, as studied by Dolphyne (1988), McCarthy and Prince (1995), Abakah (2004), etc. therefore, giving us the morphological structure: Affix 1 + Affix 2 + Stem/Base. The paper argues that in the direct verbal nominalization, whereas nominal prefixation has to apply first before nominal suffixation in the Asante-Twi dialect so that the former forms a constituent with the stem/base, in the reduplicated stem, the Affix 2 (i. e. the reduplicative prefix) has to adjoin first the stem/base before the Affix 1, which is the nominal prefix. A swap in the order/level of prefixation between Affix 1 and Affix 2 renders the output form ill-formed, a case for Siegel’s ([1974] 1979) Level Ordering Hypothesis. Following Siegel (idem), the reduplicative prefix, which does not cause a change in lexica...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background In facioscapulohumeral {{dystrophy}} (FSHD) muscle {{function is}} impaired and declines over time. Currently {{there is no}} effective treatment available to slow down this decline. We have previously reported that loss of muscle strength contributes to chronic fatigue through a decreased level of physical activity, while fatigue and physical inactivity both determine loss of societal participation. To decrease chronic fatigue, two distinctly different therapeutic approaches can be proposed: aerobic exercise training (AET) to improve physical capacity and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to stimulate an active life-style yet avoiding excessive physical strain. The primary aim of the FACTS- 2 -FSHD (acronym for Fitness And Cognitive behavioural TherapieS/for Fatigue and ACTivitieS in FSHD) trial is to study the effect of AET and CBT on the reduction of chronic fatigue as assessed with the Checklist Individual Strength subscale fatigue (CIS-fatigue) in patients with FSHD. Additionally, possible working mechanisms and the effects on various secondary outcome measures {{at all levels of}} the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) are evaluated. Methods/Design A multi-centre, assessor-blinded, randomized controlled trial is conducted. A sample of 75 FSHD patients with severe chronic fatigue (CIS-fatigue ≥ 35) will be recruited and randomized to one of three groups: (1) AET + usual care, (2) CBT + usual care or (3) usual care alone, which consists of no therapy at all or occasional (conventional) physical therapy. After an intervention period of 16 weeks and a follow-up of 3 months, the third (control) group will as yet be randomized to either AET or CBT (approximately 7 months after inclusion). Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, immediately post intervention and at 3 and 6 months <b>follow</b> <b>up.</b> <b>Discussion</b> <b>The</b> FACTS- 2 -FSHD study is the first theory-based randomized clinical trial which evaluates the effect and the maintenance of effects of AET and CBT on the reduction of chronic fatigue in patients with FSHD. The interventions are based on a theoretical model of chronic fatigue in patients with FSHD. The study will provide a unique set of data with which the relationships between outcome measures {{at all levels of the}} ICF could be assessed.

40|$|Abstract Background People {{with mental}} illness {{are more likely to}} suffer {{physical}} health problems than comparable populations who do not have mental illness. There is evidence to suggest that exercise, as well has having obvious physical benefits, also has positive effects on mental health. There is a distinct paucity of research testing its effects on young people seeking help for mental health issues. Additionally, it is generally found that compliance with prescribed exercise programmes is low. As such, encouraging young people to exercise at levels recommended by national guidelines may be unrealistic considering their struggle with mental health difficulties. It is proposed that an exercise intervention tailored to young people's preferred intensity may improve mental health outcomes, overall quality of life, and reduce exercise attrition rates. Methods/Design A sequential mixed methods design will be utilised to assess the effectiveness of an individually tailored exercise programme on the mental health outcomes of young people with depression. The mixed methods design incorporates a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT), focus groups and interviews and an economic evaluation. Participants: 158 young people (14 - 17 years) recruited from primary care and voluntary services randomly allocated to either the intervention group or control group. Intervention group : Participants will undertake a 12 week exercise programme of 12 × 60 minutes of preferred intensity aerobic exercise receiving motivational coaching and support throughout. Participants will also be invited to attend focus groups and 1 - 1 interviews following completion of the exercise programme to illicit potential barriers facilitators to participation. Control group : Participants will receive treatment as usual. Primary Outcome measure : Depression using the Children's Depression Inventory 2 (CDI- 2). Secondary Outcome measures : Quality of Life (EQ- 5 D), physical fitness (Borg RPE scale, heart rate), incidents of self-harm, treatment received and compliance with treatment, and the cost effectiveness of the intervention. Outcome measures will be taken at baseline, post intervention and 6 month <b>follow</b> <b>up.</b> <b>Discussion</b> <b>The</b> results of this study will inform policy makers of the effectiveness of preferred intensity exercise on the mental health outcomes of young people with depression, the acceptability of such an intervention to this population and its cost effectiveness.

40|$|MSW, North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 The {{focus of}} this study is on the {{evaluation}} of community based care and support service for older persons in the community. The government of South Africa and other African Countries held several <b>discussions</b> with <b>the</b> intention of addressing the needs and challenges of older persons in the community. As a <b>follow</b> <b>up</b> to <b>the</b> <b>discussion,</b> <b>the</b> new developmental approach, that is the South African Policy for Older Persons of 2005 and the Older Persons Act, 13 of 2006, promulgated in line with the recommendation of the Madrid International Plan of Action on ageing which was drafted and adopted at the World Assembly on Ageing that was convened by the United Nations in 2002. Older Persons Act 13 of 2006 was developed with the intention of addressing the needs of older persons in the community as the Aged Act no 100 of 1967 as amended in 1998, was focusing more on the residential care service. The Older Persons Act 13 of 2006 recognizes the importance of community-based care and support services and this means that the service delivery to older persons has been broadened and services have become more inclusive and accessible. Older persons will be able to remain in their communities within their families for as long as possible. According to the Older Persons Act 13 of 2006, the community-based care and support services means any programmes that are rendered to older persons to enable them to remain independent in their communities for as long as possible. These programmes are preventing the unnecessary admission of older persons in the residential care facilities. According to the Older Persons Act 13 of 2006, the Community-based care and support services are categorized into, namely, prevention and promotion programmes and the home-based care services. These two categories will be discussed in details in this study. In this study the researcher used the older persons (recipients of services), representatives of management committees for the Non-profit organizations rendering services to older persons in the community and the officials of the Department of Social Development as participants. The aim {{of this study is}} to discuss and evaluate the community-based care and support services strategy as used by the Department of Social Development in rendering services to older persons within communities in Motheo District (Free State Province) and to raise the viewpoints of direct service providers (management committees) officials of the Department of Social Development and older persons that receive these services, in order to enhance the delivery of this programme. The research methodology that was utilized in this study includes the empirical research and the literature review. A literature review was conducted by the researcher for a clear understanding of the nature and meaning of the problem that has been identified. The questionnaires and interview tools were used by the researcher as methods of data collection. This study consists of two articles, article 1 : Background and nature of community-based care and support services and article 2 : Evaluation of community-based care and support services The findings from the study indicated that the community based care and support services can be the best and important programme for older persons in the community if it can be well implemented.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{mismatch}} between diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) lesion and perfusion imaging (PI) deficit volumes {{has been used}} as a surrogate of ischemic penumbra. This pathophysiology-orientated patient selection criterion for acute stroke treatment may have the potential to replace a fixed time window. Two recent trials - DEFUSE and EPITHET - investigated the mismatch concept in a multicenter prospective approach. Both studies randomized highly selected patients (n = 74 /n = 100) and therefore confirmation in a large consecutive cohort is desirable. We here present a single-center approach with a 3 T MR tomograph next door to the stroke unit, serving as a bridge from the ER to the stroke unit to screen all TIA and stroke patients. Our primary hypothesis is that the prognostic value of the mismatch concept is depending on the vessel status. Primary endpoint of the study is infarct growth determined by imaging, secondary endpoints are neurological deficit on day 5 - 7 and functional outcome after 3 months. Methods and design 1000 Plus is a prospective, single centre observational study with 1200 patients to be recruited. All patients admitted to the ER with the clinical diagnosis of an acute cerebrovascular event within 24 hours after symptom onset are screened. Examinations are performed on day 1, 2 and 5 - 7 with neurological examination including National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scoring and stroke MRI including T 2 *, DWI, TOF-MRA, FLAIR and PI. PI is conducted as dynamic susceptibility-enhanced contrast imaging with a fixed dosage of 5 ml 1 M Gadobutrol. For post-processing of PI, mean transit time (MTT) parametric images are determined by deconvolution of the arterial input function (AIF) which is automatically identified. Lesion volumes and mismatch are measured and calculated by using the perfusion mismatch analyzer (PMA) software from ASIST-Japan. Primary endpoint is the change of infarct size between baseline examination and day 5 - 7 <b>follow</b> <b>up.</b> <b>Discussions</b> <b>The</b> aim of this study is to describe the incidence of mismatch and the predictive value of PI for final lesion size and functional outcome depending on delay of imaging and vascular recanalization. It is crucial to standardize PI for future randomized clinical trials as for individual therapeutic decisions and we expect to contribute to this challenging task.
