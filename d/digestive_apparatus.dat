500|$|The modern use of cubeb in England {{as a drug}} {{dates from}} 1815. There were various preparations, {{including}} oleum cubebae (oil of cubeb), tinctures, fluid extracts, oleo-resin compounds, and vapors, which were used for throat complaints. A small percentage of cubeb was commonly included in lozenges designed to alleviate bronchitis, in which the antiseptic and expectoral properties of the drug are useful. The most important therapeutic application of this drug, however, was in treating gonorrhea, where its antiseptic action was of much value. William Wyatt Squire wrote in 1908 that cubebs [...] "act specifically on the genito-urinary mucous membrane. (They are) given in all stages of gonorrhea". As compared with copaiba in this connection cubeb has the advantages of being less disagreeable to take and somewhat less likely to disturb the <b>digestive</b> <b>apparatus</b> in prolonged administration.|$|E

50|$|The diffuse chemosensory system (DCS) is an {{anatomical}} {{structure composed of}} solitary chemosensory cells and chemosensory clusters. The concept of DCS has been advanced in 2005, after the discovery that cells similar to gustatory elements are present in several organs of the respiratory and <b>digestive</b> <b>apparatuses.</b>|$|R
50|$|Solitary chemosensory cells (SCCs) (also called solitary {{chemoreceptor}} cells) {{are isolated}} elements located in epithelia of the apparatuses of endodermic origin (such as respiratory and <b>digestive</b> <b>apparatuses).</b> In the aquatic vertebrates, SCCs are {{also present in}} the skin. In oral cavity, SCCs precedes the development of taste buds. For long time, SCCs {{were considered to be}} typical of aquatic vertebrates.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 50 years, {{hundreds}} {{of studies have}} described those cells that are characterized by a brush of rigid apical microvilli with long rootlets, and which {{are found in the}} <b>digestive</b> and respiratory <b>apparatuses.</b> These cells have been given names such as brush cells, tuft cells, fibrillovesicular cells, multivesicular cells and caveolated cells. More recently, it has been realized that all these elements may represent a single cell type, probably with a chemosensory role, even if other functions (e. g. secretory or absorptive) seem to be possible. Very recent developments have permitted a partial definition of the chemical code characterizing these elements, revealing the presence of molecules involved in chemoreceptorial cell signalling. A molecular cascade, similar to those characterizing the gustatory epithelium, seems to be present in these elements. These new data suggest that these elements can be considered solitary chemosensory cells with the presence of the apical ‘brush’ as an inconsistent feature. They seem to comprise a diffuse chemosensory system that covers large areas (probably the whole <b>digestive</b> and respiratory <b>apparatuses)</b> with analogies to chemosensory systems described in aquatic vertebrates...|$|R

40|$|Aquatic larvae of many {{vertebrate}} lineages develop specialized, cranially located cement or attachment glands {{which allow}} them to remain attached to a substrate by means of polysaccharide secretion.

In the present work I have focused on a detailed study of the cement glands and other corresponding structures in three representatives of basal actinopterygian lineages: Senegal bichir (Polypterus senegalus), sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus), and tropical gar (Atractosteus tropicus).

60|$|The {{sense of}} taste, {{which in the}} lowest animals is {{diffused}} equally over the whole frame, is in ourselves and other higher creatures concentrated in a special part of the body, namely the mouth, where the food about to be swallowed is chewed and otherwise prepared beforehand {{for the work of}} digestion. Now it is, of course, quite clear that some sort of supervision must be exercised by the body over the kind of food {{that is going to be}} put into it. Common experience teaches us that prussic acid and pure opium are undesirable food-stuffs in large quantities; that raw spirits, petroleum, and red lead should be sparingly partaken of by the judicious feeder; and that even green fruit, the bitter end of cucumber, and the berries of deadly nightshade are unsatisfactory articles of diet when continuously persisted in. If, at the very outset of our <b>digestive</b> <b>apparatus,</b> we hadn't a sort of automatic premonitory adviser upon the kinds of food we ought or ought not to indulge in, we should naturally commit considerable imprudences in the way of eating and drinking--even more than we do at present. Natural selection has therefore provided us with a fairly efficient guide in this respect in the sense of taste, which is placed at the very threshold, as it were, of our digestive mechanism. It is the duty of taste to warn us against uneatable things, and to recommend to our favourable attention eatable and wholesome ones; and, on the whole, in spite of small occasional remissness, it performs this duty with creditable success.|$|E

Strange that in your time nobody realised that education was simply a surgical operation.

Everything learned was reproduced in a physical difference to the brain. You knew that, but you didn't see the full consequences. Then came the invention of surgical education--the simple system of opening the side of the skull and engrafting into it a piece of prepared brain. At first, of course, they had to use, I suppose, the brains of dead people, and that was ghastly"--here the Man in Asbestos shuddered like a leaf--"but very soon they found how to make moulds that did just as well. After that it was a mere nothing; an operation of a few minutes would suffice to let in poetry or foreign languages or history or anything else that one cared to have.

40|$|Analysis of the morphological, {{geological}} {{and environmental}} {{characteristics of the}} Sarno River basin has shown the present degraded condition of the area. Over the past thirty years, the supply of untreated effluent of domestic, agricultural and industrial origin has ensured the presence of high concentrations of pollutants, including heavy metals. The geological context of the catchment area has played a major part in determining the current ecological conditions and public health problems: while human activity has modified the landscape, the natural order has indirectly contributed to increasing the environmental impact. The health situation is precarious as the basin's inhabitants feed on agricultural and animal products, and use polluted water directly or indirectly. The hazard of contracting degenerative illnesses of the <b>digestive</b> or respiratory <b>apparatus,</b> bacterial infections or some neoplasia has gradually increased, especially {{in the last five}} years. Moreover, polluted basin waters flowing into the Bay of Naples increase sea water contamination, thereby damaging tourism, public health and degrading the local littoral quality. The overview presented shows how the environmental state of the Sarno River basin gives considerable cause for concern. The basin's complex geomorphologic setting has a direct bearing on local environmental and health conditions. The analysis of the available data demonstrates how the physical aspects of the area are closely linked to the diffusion and concentration of the pollutants, and how the latter ones have a large influence on the hygienic-sanitary conditions of the local population. Specific interventions need to be undertaken to monitor and improve the chemical, physical and microbiological conditions of water and sediments, {{especially in light of the}} geomorphological vulnerability of the river basin...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigate}} mRNA expression of interleukin- 8 (IL- 8), a potent neutrophil chemoattractant, and interferon-gamma (IFN-&# 947;), {{one of the major}} responsible of antiviral effect, in Bovine Viral Diarrohea Virus (BVDV) infection. Total RNA was isolated from brain, cerebellum and in lymphatic organs from immune, <b>digestive</b> and respiratory <b>apparatus</b> from 12 BVDV infected and 3 healthy animals. The samples were DNase treated, retrotranscripted and quantified by SYBR Green real time PCR performed on Rotor-Gene 3000. The primers for each target gene, GADPH as housekeeping and BVDV were designed using the Oligo software on sequences available from Genbank database. A recombinant plasmid was constructed for each target gene and serial dilutions were used to construct a standard curve. Melting curve analysis was performed for each assay. The number of copies of target genes and of BVDV genome were normalized by the ratio with the number of copies of housekeeping gene. All the values obtained were statistically analysed by One-way ANOVA. In healthy animals IL- 8 was not or weakly expressed; this is not unusual because it is a proinflammatory cytokine that is expressed during inflammation. IFN-&# 947;, instead, showed a basal level of expression in the healthy animals, in fact, it is a cytokine normally expressed by Th 1 lymphocytes. Eight BVDV infected animals showed a strong downregulation of IL- 8 expression. In some organs of 4 animals the expression of IL- 8 were less inhibited; in these organs we observed purulent lesions: neuthophils’ attraction is, in fact, mediated by IL- 8. In 8 infected animals also IFN-&# 947; levels were lower than the levels in healthy animals. In some organs of the other 4 animals the IFN-&# 947; expression levels were similar to the values in healthy animals; in these organs we also detected a low BVDV amount. We, in fact, observed a correlation between the cytokines’ expression and virus level: a higher downregulation of both cytokines was evidenced in organs with greater BVDV levels. This study permitted to analyse and confirms the interference of BVDV on immunology systems in natural infected animals. Particularly downregulation of IFN-&# 947; showed the effect of BVDV on Th 1 response and downregulation of IL- 8 showed its inhibition of inflammatory response...|$|R

60|$|Hence it {{will not}} do for the Landlord to possess too fine a nature. He must have health above the common {{accidents}} of life, subject to no modern fashionable diseases; but no taste, rather a vast relish or appetite. His sentiments on all subjects will be delivered as freely as the wind blows; there is nothing private or individual in them, though still original, but they are public, and of the hue of the heavens over his house,--a certain out-of-door obviousness and transparency not to be disputed. What he does, his manners {{are not to be}} complained of, though abstractly offensive, for it is what man does, and in him the race is exhibited. When he eats, he is liver and bowels, and the whole <b>digestive</b> <b>apparatus</b> to the company, and so all admit the thing is done. He must have no idiosyncrasies, no particular bents or tendencies to this or that, but a general, uniform, and healthy development, such as his portly person indicates, offering himself equally on all sides to men. He is not one of your peaked and inhospitable men of genius, with particular tastes, but, as we said before, has one uniform relish, and taste which never aspires higher than a tavern-sign, or the cut of a weather-cock. The man of genius, like a dog with a bone, or the slave who has swallowed a diamond, or a patient with the gravel, sits afar and retired, off the road, hangs out no sign of refreshment for man and beast, but says, by all possible hints and signs, I wish to be alone--good-by--farewell. But the landlord can afford to live without privacy. He entertains no private thought, he cherishes no solitary hour, no Sabbath day, but thinks,--enough to assert the dignity of reason,--and talks, and reads the newspaper. What he does not tell to one traveller, he tells to another. He never wants to be alone, but sleeps, wakes, eats, drinks, sociably, still remembering his race. He walks abroad through the thoughts of men, and the Iliad and Shakspeare are tame to him, who hears the rude but homely incidents of the road from every traveller. The mail might drive through his brain {{in the midst of his}} most lonely soliloquy, without disturbing his equanimity, provided it brought plenty of news and passengers. There can be no pro-fanity where there is no fane behind, and the whole world may see quite round him. Perchance his lines have fallen to him in dustier places, and he has heroically sat down where two roads meet, or at the Four Corners, or the Five Points, and his life is sublimely trivial for the good of men. The dust of travel blows ever in his eyes, and they preserve their clear, complacent look. The hourlies and half-hourlies, the dailies and weeklies, whirl on well-worn tracks, round and round his house, as if it were the goal in the stadium, and still he sits within in unruffled serenity, with no show of retreat. His neighbor dwells timidly behind a screen of poplars and willows, and a fence with sheaves of spears at regular intervals, or defended against the tender palms of visitors by sharp spikes,--but the traveller's wheels rattle over the door-step of the tavern, and he cracks his whip in the entry. He is truly glad to see you, and sincere as the bull's-eye over his door. The traveller seeks to find, wherever he goes, some one who will stand in this broad and catholic relation to him, who will be an inhabitant of the land to him a stranger, and represent its human nature, as the rock stands for its inanimate nature; and this is he. As his crib furnishes provender for the traveller's horse, and his larder provisions for his appetite, so his conversation furnishes the necessary aliment to his spirits. He knows very well what a man wants, for he is a man himself, and as it were the farthest travelled, though he has never stirred from his door. He understands his needs and destiny. He would be well fed and lodged, there can be no doubt, and have the transient sympathy of a cheerful companion, and of a heart which always prophesies fair weather. And after all the greatest men, even, want much more the sympathy which every honest fellow can give, than that which the great only can impart. If he is not the most upright, let us allow him this praise, that he is the most downright of men. He has a hand to shake and to be shaken, and takes a sturdy and unquestionable interest in you, as if he had assumed the care of you, but if you will break your neck, he will even give you the best advice as to the method.|$|E

5000|$|The modern use of cubeb in England {{as a drug}} {{dates from}} 1815. There were various preparations, {{including}} oleum cubebae (oil of cubeb), tinctures, fluid extracts, oleo-resin compounds, and vapors, which were used for throat complaints. A small percentage of cubeb was commonly included in lozenges designed to alleviate bronchitis, in which the antiseptic and expectoral properties of the drug are useful. The most important therapeutic application of this drug, however, was in treating gonorrhea, where its antiseptic action was of much value. William Wyatt Squire wrote in 1908 that cubebs [...] "act specifically on the genito-urinary mucous membrane. (They are) given in all stages of gonorrhea". As compared with copaiba in this connection cubeb has the advantages of being less disagreeable to take and somewhat less likely to disturb the <b>digestive</b> <b>apparatus</b> in prolonged administration..|$|E

The Doctor one day, whilst dissecting the <b>digestive</b> <b>apparatus</b> of a young alligator, called this boy to hold the parts for him, so as to keep the fibers stretched. Just as the Doctor was most interested in tracing some minute muscular fibers, the boy cried out, ' I am going to faint,' and altered the position of his hand, and thus interrupted the dissection at a most important point. The Doctor immediately gave him a sharp slap {{on the side of his}} head, saying, ' Well, go faint then, and come back quickly.' The boy did as he was bid, and never fainted after this. He said he ' was cured by holding the alligator.'" ...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the glycoconjugate histochemistry in the different parts of the <b>digestive</b> <b>apparatus</b> (oesophagus, stomach, intestine) of Umbrina cirrosa (L.) fry using classical histochemical reactions (periodic acid-Schiff, Alcian blue pH 2. 5, Alcian blue/periodic acid-Schiff, high iron diamine, low iron diamine) in conjunction with glycolytic digestions that degrade different classes of glycosoaminoglycans. No differences were observed in the reactivity to conventional histochemical staining of the oesophagus, stomach or intestine among 27 -, 34 - or 44 -day-old fry. In the oesophagus, the mucopolysaccharides contained chondroitin sulphates B and A and/or C, heparan sulphate and chondroitin. In the stomach, only neutral glycoconjugates were revealed, whereas in the intestine there were only chondroitin sulphates. Some differences in the type and content of glycoconjugates were found in Umbrina cirrosa (L.) fry compared to those of adult subjects, probably related to different dietary habits and to changes in the environmental conditions...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe <b>digestive</b> <b>apparatus</b> of {{termites}} {{may have}} several biotechnological applications, {{as well as}} being a target for pest control. This report discusses the detection of cellulases (endoglucanase, exoglucanase, and β-glucosidase), hemicellulases (β-xylosidase, α-l-arabinofuranosidase, and β-d-xylanase), α-amylase, and proteases (trypsin-like, chymotrypsin-like, and keratinase-type) in gut extracts from Nasutitermes corniger workers and soldiers. Additionally, the effects of pH (3. 0 – 11. 0) and temperature (30 – 100 °C) on enzyme activities were evaluated. All enzymes investigated were detected in the gut extracts of worker and soldier termites. Endoglucanase and β-xylanase were the main cellulase and hemicellulase, respectively. Zymography for proteases of worker extracts revealed polypeptides of 22, 30, and 43 kDa that hydrolyzed casein, and assays using protease inhibitors showed that serine proteases were the main proteases in worker and soldier guts. The determined enzyme activities and their response to different pH and temperature values revealed that workers and soldiers contained a distinct <b>digestive</b> <b>apparatus.</b> The ability of these termites to efficiently digest the main components of lignocellulosic materials stimulates the purification of gut enzymes. Further investigation into their biotechnological potential as well as whether the enzymes detected are produced by the termites or by their symbionts is needed...|$|E
