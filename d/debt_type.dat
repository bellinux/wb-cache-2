40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{literature}} on the determinants of debt maturity and <b>debt</b> <b>type</b> choice by specifying and estimating a model that incorporates the interrelationship between maturity and <b>debt</b> <b>type</b> decisions. The potential interrelationship stems from agency cost and flotation cost hypotheses. In the agency cost framework, issuing private debt and shortening debt maturity are substitutes for resolving agency conflicts, whereas under the flotation cost hypothesis, increasing the size of public debt issues and lengthening debt maturity are alternative mechanisms for mitigating the large fixed transaction costs associated with public issues. Using a sample of incremental financing decisions made by Australian firms in international bond and syndicated loan markets, the results suggest a uni-directional relationship rather than a two-way relationship, with maturity preferences having a strong influence on the choice of public versus private debt, but little evidence of the choice of <b>debt</b> <b>type</b> affecting maturity. The other determinants of <b>debt</b> <b>type</b> provide support for the renegotiation and liquidation hypothesis, reputation and hold-up costs hypotheses. For debt maturity choice, relatively high and low liquidity risk firms prefer short term debt while intermediate risk firms and firms with high marginal tax rates borrow at longer maturities.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} impact of {{corporate}} governance on the demand for intermediated debt (asset finance, bank debt, non-bank private debt) and non-intermediated debt (public debt) in the Australian debt market. Relative to other countries the Australian debt market is characterised by higher proportions of intermediated or private debt with a lower inherent level of information asymmetry in that private lenders have greater access to financial information (Gray, Koh & Tong 2009). Our firm level, cross-sectional evidence suggests that higher corporate governance impacts demand for debt via the mitigation of default risk. However, this relationship is not uniform across all <b>debt</b> <b>types.</b> Intermediated <b>debt</b> such as bank and asset finance debt are more responsive to changes in governance-default risk relationship than non-bank and non-intermediated debt.

30|$|We also {{addressed}} {{the possibility of}} reverse causality. Specifically, there are theoretical arguments to expect that the firm’s debt structure generates equity risk (in the line of Modigliani-Miller’s Proposition II) that, in turn, may affect the constituents of ASY. This argument mostly applies for total leverage (not considered in our study) {{and it could be}} less relevant with respect to the composition of debt. To examine whether the different types of debt affect equity risk, we regress idiosyncratic risk against each one of our types of debt ratio controlling by variables identified in prior literature as related to equity risk. Our findings (not tabulated) indicate that the <b>debt</b> <b>type</b> ratios used as dependent variables in our paper do not significantly affect the equity risk and, consequently, that our findings are not driven by this reverse causality concern.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of state payout {{restrictions}} on firms' credit ratings and bond yields. Using publicly traded bond data for a sample of large firms, we find that firms incorporated in states with more restrictive payout statutes (for example, New York and California) have better credit ratings and significantly lower yield spreads (about 8. 7 percent) than do firms incorporated in less restrictive states (for example, Delaware). These results suggest that incorporation in a more restrictive state provides a credible commitment mechanism for avoiding some of the moral hazard problems associated with long-term debt. This commitment corresponds to an economically and statistically significant difference in market yields and firm-financing costs and is robust to controls for ownership, governance, <b>debt</b> <b>type,</b> Delaware or non-Delaware incorporation, and covenant usage.

Could consolidation combat erratic tonnage demand, mounting regulatory pressure to provide quality service at reduced costs, rising costs of finance and unpredictable long-term returns that deter institutional capital? A questionnaire survey of capital providers' and charterers' attitudes towards consolidation found that long-term vessel employment concerned all potential capital providers, with perceptions of management experience and reputation critical to risk evaluation. <b>Debt</b> <b>type</b> providers were more supportive of consolidation practices, expecting more predictable repayment of principal and interest payments in larger companies, but equity type providers feared reduced opportunities to participate in speculative capital gains or asset play. Comparative interviews with two major crude carrier operators revealed contrasting strategies. One concentrated on pursuing short-term wealth maximisation through ensuring operational autonomy and asset flexibility and another on long-term wealth creation based on ballast minimisation and tactical capacity expansion. Long-term, a trend towards oligopoly is expected in crude tanker carriage, with competitive strategies likely to focus increasingly on differentiation as the potential for operational cost-reduction fades.

One of these related factors is the link between the indebtedness of national governments and that of families in their respective countries which calls for further examination. However, the most pressing of the topics in this respect, one that may send shivers down our spines, is this simple question: “As the developed countries have already seen a large number of defaults of businesses and banks, with us now therefore perceiving this phenomenon as a standard part of the economy undergoing recession or stagnation while we also get used to countries on the brink of bankruptcy being bought out by extensive aid provided by other countries under non-market conditions, are we to expect future financial collapses to affect families or entire social strata and their budgets on a mass scale ?” As clear evidence exists that the key cause of defaults is the untamed debts, which get out of the control of businesses or governments, we should get alarmed by the fact that private loans, as opposed to business or government loans, have become the most dynamically growing <b>debt</b> <b>type</b> in developed countries over the recent years. state indebtedness, private loans, debt imbalance...|$|E
40|$|Using {{a unique}} dataset of East Asian {{non-financial}} companies, this paper examines a firm's choice between local currency, foreign currency, and synthetic local currency (hedged foreign currency) debt. We also exploit the Asian financial crisis of 1997 {{as a natural}} experiment to investigate the role of <b>debt</b> <b>type</b> in financial and operating performance. We find evidence of unique, as well as common, factors that determine each debt type's use thus indicating the importance of examining debt at a disaggregated level. Specifically, the use of natural local currency debt is associated primarily with factors found by many other studies to determine total debt levels such as size, profitability, and the market-to-book ratio. Foreign currency debt {{is used as a}} complement to local currency debt by firms with substantial capital needs seeking to lower the cost or extend the maturity structure of debt. However, the use of foreign currency debt is also determined by asset and income type consistent with agency cost and financial risk management theories.

Finally, contrary to anecdotal reports and existing theory, we find no evidence that unhedged foreign currency debt is associated with significantly worse performance during the Asian crisis. Surprisingly, the use of synthetic local currency debt is associated with the biggest drop in market value, possibly due to currency derivative market illiquidity during the crisis...|$|E
40|$|The article {{examines}} the need in analytical support and management of accounts payable as forming factors of liquidity. It deals with the state and tendencies in formation of types of debt by the example of milk processing enterprises. The comparative analysis of the debt ratios at the company is carried out. It includes the settlements with debtors and creditors related to incoming and outgoing financial flows. The status of such calculations significantly affect the financial results {{of the company and}} its development. Therefore, the research of types of debt as the important factor in increasing the efficiency of the enterprise is of particular relevance. Economic relations between economic entities create the conditions where they can act both as sellers and buyers causing the objective of various types of debt. The presence of debt types is caused by various reasons, for instance, the incompliance of finished goods shipment, performance of works or services, receipt of commodity-material values, accrual payments to the moment of payment. Accounts receivable have a significant share in the composition of current assets. Therefore, the important place is given to the analysis of receivables when the company analyzes the turnover of its working capital. The source of the analysis is an enterprise balance sheet, the data of analytical accounting are used for the internal analysis. The detailed analysis of accounts receivable is carried out in order to take current management decisions on their reduction, and use timely actions for recovering doubtful receivables. In managing receivables and payables one should regularly monitor their ratio level, turnover rates and the period of maturity. In addition to these quantitative indicators one should also calculate quality indicators, in particular, to identify the groups of products, which account for the largest share in debt. The imbalance between the types of debt leads to uncontrolled growth in debt, deteriorating financial condition of businesses, devastating economic consequences, therefore, the objective need is to develop the system of its monitoring.

40|$|Leverage is an {{essential}} but often troubling component of the U. S. market. The financial crisis highlighted the risks and complexity of a leverage web that includes flesh-and-blood {{people from all walks}} of life and paper people from all corners of the business and investment world. In the tax area, the potentially problematic incentive effects of interest deductibility have long engaged a wide array of tax commentators and policymakers. While interest deductibility rightly receives widespread scrutiny, a more comprehensive approach to leverage is needed. This Article focuses on the surprisingly complicated tax treatment of cash (and cash equivalent) borrowings. This Article highlights that the current tax treatment of debt principal used to finance business and investment deductions yields favorable tax timing mismatches for taxpayers and thereby theoretically amplifies any distortions caused by the deductibility of debt interest. The tax system’s current approach to debt-financed tax benefits reflects reactive responses to particular forms of tax avoidance. The current system’s reliance on a factor drawn from tax avoidance case law— likelihood of repayment—has led to an inherently flawed set of tax rules. For example, the at-risk rules identify nonrecourse debt as problematic and then impose timing limitations on tax benefits financed only with that <b>debt</b> <b>type</b> even though potential timing distortions are embedded in all cash borrowings. Thus, the at-risk rules treat nonrecourse debt as simultaneously bona fide and suspect, yet whether an agreement constitutes bona fide debt still must be determined using a facts-andcircumstances, case-by-case analysis. The resulting tax rules relating directly to debt principal are confusing and inconsistent. The rules also invite extensive tax planning, whether legitimate or avoidant. The main tax problems relating to debt principal—the timing distortion and the possibility of sham debt—should be addressed as distinct issues with priority given to the timing issue. Giving renewed attention to resolving the timing distortion would facilitate a comprehensive approach to debt and would also have the likely side benefit of making sham debt less attractive. This Article examines multiple proposals for directly limiting timing benefits. Solving timing distortions for even simple cash debt is quite difficult. Thus, this Article details a more accurate, more complex reform avenue but also suggests a simpler, rougher justice one as well. The more complex approach rations the use of borrowed basis while the simpler approach utilizes a deferral charge. In addition, this Article briefly reviews (and rejects) two other possibilities—treating all debt as lacking basis and treating cash equivalent debt as income on receipt. If it is not currently possible to implement broader reform proposals, incremental reform that distinguishes more carefully between the underlying timing distortion and tax avoidance behavior could bring greater coherence to the taxing problem of debt principal...|$|E
40|$|First passage models, where {{corporate}} assets {{undergo a}} random walk and default occurs if the assets fall below a threshold, provide an attractive framework for modeling the default process. Recently such {{models have been}} generalized to allow a fluctuating default threshold or equivalently a fluctuating total recovery fraction $R$. For a given company a particular <b>type</b> of <b>debt</b> has a recovery fraction $R_i$ that is greater or less than $R$ depending on its level of subordination. In general the $R_i$ are functions of $R$ and since, in models with a fluctuating default threshold, the probability of default depends on $R$ there are correlations between the recovery fractions $R_i$ and the probability of default.
