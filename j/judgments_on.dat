5|$|Political Economy, {{the first}} edition {{published}} in 1883, {{was one of the}} most widely used textbooks of the 19th century as a component of the American Science Series. Robert Solow criticized the third edition (1888) for being devoid of facts, figures, and mostly full of off-the-cuff <b>judgments</b> <b>on</b> the practices and capacities of Native Americans and immigrants, but generally embodying the state of the art of economics at the time.|$|E
5|$|The {{level of}} secrecy of the case, which was criticised by some {{contemporary}} observers, {{meant that it}} was not properly recorded or published, and the exact facts of the argument were not known for some time. As a result, whilst it sharply differs from later rulings such as Corbett v Corbett , it was not able to be considered as precedent in later <b>judgments</b> <b>on</b> the legal recognition of gender variance.|$|E
5|$|According to a {{study by}} economists at St Gallen University credit rating {{agencies}} have fuelled rising euro zone indebtedness by issuing more severe downgrades since the sovereign debt crisis unfolded in 2009. The authors concluded that rating agencies were not consistent in their <b>judgments,</b> <b>on</b> average rating Portugal, Ireland, and Greece 2.3 notches lower than under pre-crisis standards, eventually forcing them to seek international aid. On a side note: as of end of November 2013 only three countries in the eurozone retain AAA ratings from Standard & Poor, i.e. Germany, Finland and Luxembourg.|$|E

50|$|In the 1980s Rabinowitch {{started to}} {{construct}} works that were seen, by chance, {{to relate to}} particular public places. These constructions listed chronologically are: <b>Judgment</b> <b>on</b> the Keplerian Revolution (Furkapasshöhe, Swiss Alps), Newton on Top of Aristotle (Sarabhai Retreat, Ahmedabad, India), Éloges de Fontenelle (Toronto Convention Centre), Leibniz and Newton (Neue Nationalgalerie Platz, Berlin), Tyco and Jepp (Kornwestheim Bahnhof), <b>Judgment</b> <b>on</b> Newton’s Principle of Inertia (John’s Castle, Limerick), Galileo’s <b>Judgment</b> <b>on</b> Ptolemy and Copernicus (WATARI-UM, Tokyo), <b>Judgment</b> <b>on</b> the Copernican Revolution (chosen by Berlin Mitte for Leipziger Platz), Bell for Kepler (Sesquicentennial Plaza, Waterloo, Ontario).|$|R

5|$|In 1965, {{he stood}} to inherit his elder brother's baronetcy, {{together}} with a large estate. This inheritance was challenged by his cousin, who argued that the re-registration was invalid; under this interpretation, Forbes would legally be considered a woman, and thus unable to inherit. The legal position was unclear, and it took three years before a ruling by the Court of Session was finally upheld by the Home Secretary, granting him the title. The case was held in great secrecy, with the effect that it was unable {{to be considered in}} other <b>judgments</b> <b>on</b> the legal recognition of gender variance, but has become more widely known since his death in 1991.|$|E
5|$|With his <b>judgments</b> <b>on</b> war {{pensions}} {{and his role}} in the enquiry into the Profumo Affair, Denning became possibly the best-known judge ever to belong to the English judiciary, with the public treating Lord Denning and the Court of Appeal as synonymous. He was equally well-loved and controversial, appreciated for his role as 'the people's judge' and his support for the common man and disliked by elements of the bar and judiciary for 'uncertainty in the law' created by his broad judgments.|$|E

25|$|Research {{instruments}} are also often insufficiently sensitive {{to discriminate between}} independent, true dual pathology, and substance-induced symptoms. Structured instruments, as Global Appraisal of Individual Needs - Short Screener-GAIN-SS and Psychiatric Research Interview for Substance and Mental Disorders for DSM-IV-PRISM, {{have been developed to}} increase the diagnostic validity. While structured instruments can help organize diagnostic information, clinicians must still make <b>judgments</b> <b>on</b> the origin of symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Sistani {{began his}} {{religious}} {{education as a}} child, first in Mashhad in his father's hawzah, and continuing later in Qom. In 1951, Sistani traveled to Iraq to study in Najaf under Grand Ayatollah Abu al-Qasim al-Khoei. Sistani rose to the Usooli clerical rank of 'mujtahid' in 1960. At the unusually young age of thirty-one, Sistani reached the senior level of clerical accomplishment, or ijtihad, which entitled him to pass his own <b>judgments</b> <b>on</b> religious questions.|$|E

25|$|With Europe facing World War I, {{whoever was}} {{selected}} would face {{the difficulty of}} leading the Holy See through the war to end all wars, in which Catholic Belgium and France were attacked by Protestant Germany, which was supported by Catholic Austria while the Protestant United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (including Catholic Ireland) and Russian Orthodox Russia sided with France.

25|$|In 2007, {{there were}} 2830 {{applications}} lodged against the Republic of Turkey before the ECtHR and consequently 331 <b>judgments</b> <b>on</b> the merits {{have been issued}} affirming 319 violations and 9 non-violations.

25|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{financial}} crisis of 2007–08 and the search for {{a way out of the}} crisis, a worldwide move toward Keynesian deficit financing and general resurgence of Keynesian policies resulted in a new economic consensus, which involved reassessment or even reversal of normative <b>judgments</b> <b>on</b> a number of topics. The Keynesian view receiving most attention has been fiscal stimulus, applied by numerous states as a response to the Great Recession.

25|$|As {{the primary}} civil law {{enforcement}} agency of The City of New York, the Sheriff's Office typically acts as the enforcer of civil judgments won by the city against individuals and businesses. The agency also enforces <b>judgments</b> <b>on</b> behalf of private petitioners' as well. Though the sheriff and his/her deputies retain their status as peace officers/law enforcement officers, traditional patrol and other law enforcement functions are handled by other departments - the NYPD oversees law enforcement; the Department of Corrections manages the city's jails; the Office of the Medical Examiner handles the coroner functions; and Court Officers handle security for the courts themselves and in lock-ups within court buildings. The New York City Sheriff's Office does provide criminal investigation services in cases involving city tax and deed fraud, as well as illegal tobacco distribution and smuggling.|$|E
25|$|There is also {{a drastic}} lack of {{education}} given to governments, farmers, and the community about the science behind GM crops, as well as suitable growing practices. In most relief programs, farmers are given seeds with little explanation and little {{attention is paid to}} the resources available to them or even laws that prohibit them from distributing produce. Governments are often not advised on the economic and health implications that come with growing GM crops, and are then left to make <b>judgments</b> <b>on</b> their own. Because they have so little information regarding these crops, they usually shy away from allowing them or do not take the time and effort required to regulate their use. Members of the community that will then consume the produce from these crops are also left in the dark about what these modifications mean and are often scared off by their 'unnatural' origins. This has resulted in failure to properly grow crops as well as strong opposition to the unknown practices.|$|E
