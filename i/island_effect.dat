40|$|The {{detection}} of <b>islanding</b> <b>effect</b> {{is a highly}} important topic for photovoltaic (PV) power system. The <b>islanding</b> <b>effect</b> occurs when the distributed power source is disconnected from the main supply while the power is still supplied in partial load area, which may injure the set maintenance personnel or damage the equipment. Combining chaotic synchronization and extension theory, this research is to propose a novel detection method to distinguish the occurrence of <b>islanding</b> <b>effect</b> based on nonautonomous Chua’s circuit. To demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed method, this paper applies PSIM to simulate the PV power system.

40|$|The {{cause of}} <b>island</b> <b>effects</b> has evoked {{considerable}} debate within syntax and other fields of linguistics. The two competing approaches stand out: the grammatical analysis; and the working-memory (WM) -based processing analysis. In this paper we report three experiments designed to test {{one of the}} premises of the WM-based processing analysis: that the strength of <b>island</b> <b>effects</b> should vary {{as a function of}} individual differences in WM capacity. The results show that <b>island</b> <b>effects</b> present even for L 2 learners are more likely attributed to grammatical constraints than to limited processing resources. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{preliminary}} {{results of an}} independent assessment {{carried out by the}} Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature group, and made available to the public in October 2011, found that among other scientific concerns raised by skeptics, the urban heat <b>island</b> <b>effect</b> did not bias the results obtained by NOAA, the Hadley Centre and NASA's GISS. The Berkeley Earth group also confirmed that over the past 50 years the land surface warmed by 0.911°C, and their results closely matched those obtained from earlier studies.|$|E

Research on China indicates that urban heat <b>island</b> <b>effect</b> contributes to climate warming by about 30%.

It is concluded that only Chinese alternative questions are not licensed by movement, while the other two are. Without involving movement, Chinese alternative questions are thus found with the absence of <b>island</b> <b>effects.</b> 1...|$|R

40|$|Relativized Minimality and the Minimal Link Condition are conceptually related, {{and there}} {{is a certain amount of}} {{empirical}} overlap. These constraints can account for operator <b>island</b> <b>effects</b> (specifically, wh-island and topic <b>island</b> <b>effects).</b> I argue that both constraints are conceptually problematic from a minimalist point of view; furthermore, they can be shown to be empirically problematic because they cannot predict asymmetries between movement types as they show up both with the island-creating item and the long-distance-moved item. In contrast, I suggest exploiting a consequence of the PIC-approach to CED islands developed in Müller (2010). A side effect of this approach is that intermediate movement steps of successive-cyclic movement end up in non-outermost specifiers; they precede the final movement operation triggered by regular structure-building features of a head. I call this consequence the Intermediate Step Corollary. The Intermediate Step Corollary makes a new account of operator <b>island</b> <b>effects</b> possible that does not rely on the concept of intervention: It suffices to postulate that certain types of goal features on categories (like wh-features) automatically trigger checking once they enter a suitable configuration (as they do with intermediate movement steps); this is an instantiation of a more general concept of feature maraudage. As a consequence, operator <b>island</b> <b>effects</b> are derived (as is their variable nature).

Arguments for this classification come from differences in case marking and <b>island</b> <b>effects.</b> Merchant (2009) notes the same <b>island</b> <b>effects</b> in Greek comparatives, and by applying his analysis to Dutch we can explain the differences between the Dutch phrasal and clausal comparatives. Crucial in this analysis is the ellipsis of underlying structure, not only in the reduced clausal comparative, but also in the phrasal comparative, which reflects the similarity in their interpretation...|$|R

40|$|Competence-based {{theories}} of <b>island</b> <b>effects</b> {{play a central}} role in generative grammar, yet the graded nature of many syntactic islands has never been properly accounted for. Categorical syntactic accounts of <b>island</b> <b>effects</b> have persisted in spite of a wealth of data suggesting that <b>island</b> <b>effects</b> are not categorical in nature and that non-structural manipulations that leave island structures intact can radically alter judgments of island violations. We argue here, building on work by Deane, Kluender, and others, that processing factors have the potential to account for this otherwise unexplained variation in acceptability judgments. We report the results of self-paced reading experiments and controlled acceptability studies which explore the relationship between processing costs and judgments of acceptability. In each of the three self-paced reading studies, the data indicate that the processing cost of different types of island violations can be significantly reduced to a degree comparable to that of non-island filler-gap constructions by manipulating a single non-structural factor. Moreover, this reduction in processing cost is accompanied by significant improvements in acceptability. This evidence favors the hypothesis tha...|$|R
40|$|Sprouse, Wagers, & Phillips (in press) {{carried out}} two {{experiments}} {{in which they}} measured individual differences in memory to test processing accounts of <b>island</b> <b>effects.</b> They found that these individual differences failed to predict the magnitude of <b>island</b> <b>effects</b> and construe these findings as counterevidence to processing-based accounts of <b>island</b> <b>effects.</b> Here, we take up several problems with their methods, their findings, and their conclusions. First, the arguments against processing accounts are based on null results using tasks that may be ineffective or inappropriate measures of working memory (the n-back and serial recall tasks). The authors provide no evidence that these two measures predict judgments for other constructions {{that are difficult to}} process and yet are clearly grammatical. They assume that other measures of working memory would have yielded the same result, but provide no justification that they should. We further show that whether a working memory measure relates to judgments of grammatical, hard-to-process sentences depends on how difficult the sentences are. In this light, the stimuli used by the authors present processing difficulties other than the island violations under investigation and may have been particularly hard t...|$|R

From the findings, the primary benefits of VGS perceived by end users are enhancing visual quality, bringing nature harmony, reducing stress and reducing the urban heat <b>island</b> <b>effects.</b> The perceptions contradict with the results of ANOVA test between reducing the urban heat <b>island</b> <b>effects</b> and other VGS benefits that proves the need and effort to work on VGS in Malaysia...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} has highlighted a remarkable variability in subject <b>island</b> <b>effects.</b> Focusing on intransitive verbs and adjectives, {{we argue that}} islandhood is determined at the syntax-semantics interface: subjects qualify as islands when they are interpreted outside the predicative nucleus of the clause, in a categorical LF structure (Ladusaw 1994); they are transparent for extraction when they undergo total reconstruction into the predicative nucleus, giving rise to a thetic structure. The thetic/categorical interpretation depends on various factors (most notably the stage-level versus individual-level nature of the predicate), whose interaction accounts for the observed variability of <b>island</b> <b>effects,</b> as shown by our experimental evidence. The relevance of subject reconstruction need not be stipulated; rather, it follows from a top-down-oriented computation, in which movement dependencies are implemented by a storage-and-retrieval mechanism...|$|R
