500|$|Jerry {{tries to}} apologize, even going {{as far as}} to compare ponies with compact cars, but Manya gets even more angry and leaves the table. Just after she leaves, Jerry tries to reason with the others {{that he did not know}} she had a pony and wonders why {{immigrants}} with ponies would leave Europe to come to America without ponies ("Who leaves a country packed with ponies to come to a non-pony country?") After the dinner, when Jerry's parents are leaving, his father soothes: [...] "Hey, <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> Nobody likes a kid with a pony." [...] But Jerry receives a phone call from Uncle Leo, who informs him that Manya has died. Jerry is very upset about it, but he's also upset to learn that the funeral will be held on the same day of his softball championship.|$|E
500|$|On 12 December 2008, Che was {{screened}} at New York City's {{sold out}} 1,100 person Ziegfeld Theater. Upon seeing the first {{image on the}} screen (a silhouette of Cuba), the crowd erupted into a raucous cry of [...] "¡Viva, Cuba!" [...] Following the film, and the standing ovation it received, Soderbergh appeared for a post program Q During the sometimes contentious conversation with the audience, in which Soderbergh alternated between defensiveness and modesty, the director categorized Guevara as [...] "a hard ass", to which one audience member yelled out, [...] "Bullshit, he was a murderer!" [...] The filmmaker settled down the crowd and explained, [...] "It doesn't matter whether <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> or not—I was interested in Che as a warrior, Che {{as a guy who}} had an ideology, who picked up a gun and this was the result. He died the way you would have him die. He was executed the way you would say he executed other people". Soderbergh ended the 1 am Q session by noting that he was [...] "agnostic" [...] on Che's standing, but [...] "loyal to the facts", which he insisted were all rigorously sourced.|$|E
2500|$|Susan King, a past {{spokesperson}} for [...] San Francisco's Green Party, said about Daly, [...] "At {{the end of}} the day, I totally appreciate {{the fact that he is}} out there in the trenches. It's not 100 percent that <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> but you know where his heart is and where his values are." [...] Nathan Nayman, executive director of the Committee on Jobs (a pro-business PAC that receives contributions from corporate donors and promotes economic development ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Sakari {{suggested}} that himself, and when <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> {{he proceeded to}} demolish it. He has treated me dreadfully.|$|R
60|$|Rectus {{thought this}} was {{the worst kind of}} injustice, and <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> {{although}} <b>I</b> didn't see {{what we were going to}} do about it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Shall I scream, William Adolphus?" [...] I {{demanded of}} that {{intelligent}} animal. William Adolphus shook his head. This is a fact. And <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The filmmaker defended {{himself in}} an {{interview}} with ABC News correspondent Jake Tapper, answering: [...] "Actually I do [...] article and it's blown up 40 foot on the screen, you can see Richard Clarke's name right there saying that he approved the flights based on the information the FBI gave him. It's right there, right up on the screen. I don't agree with Clarke on this point. Just because I think he's good {{on a lot of things}} doesn't mean <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> on everything." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{their many}} {{disagreements}} Brooke and Churchill held an affection for each other. After one fierce clash Churchill told {{his chief of}} staff and military adviser, Sir Hastings Ismay, that he did not think he could continue to work any longer with Brooke because [...] "he hates me. I can see hatred looking from his eyes." [...] Brooke responded to Ismay: “Hate him? I don't hate him. I love him. But the first time I tell him that <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> when I don't will be the time to get rid of me, for then I can be no more use to him." [...] When Churchill was told this he murmured, ”Dear Brookie.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Alveda King, a {{minister}} and pro-life activist and former Georgia State Representative {{who is a}} niece {{of the civil rights}} leader Martin Luther King, appealed to rally attendees to [...] "focus not on elections or on political causes but on honor, on character ... not the color of our skin. Yes, I too have a dream.... That America will pray and God will forgive us our sins and revive us our land." [...] King also addressed the civil rights leaders and members of the black community who had been critical of the rally, responding that [...] "My daddy, Rev. A. D. King, my granddaddy, Martin Luther King, Senior – we are a family of faith, hope and love. And that's why I'm here today. Glenn says there is one human race; <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> We are not here to divide. I'm about unity. That's why I'm here, and I want to honor my uncle today." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{was with}} me late last night, Bessy; and {{when he told me}} what had passed between you <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> that he had better go." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> {{that his}} chances had been unique {{and that he}} was a most lucky archæologist, and {{presently}} he went on puffing at his pipe.|$|R
60|$|I made {{no answer}} to the Sergeant, for {{although}} <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> {{there was nothing to}} be done, and talking about a bad business would only make it worse.|$|R
2500|$|As {{expressed}} by Russell [...] "the process of transforming constants in a proposition into variables leads {{to what is}} called generalization, and gives us, as it were, the formal essence of a proposition ... So long as any term in our proposition {{can be turned into}} a variable, our proposition can be generalized; and so long as this is possible, it is the business of mathematics to do it"; these generalizations Russell named propositional functions". Indeed he cites and quotes from Frege's Begriffsschrift and presents a vivid example from Frege's 1891 Function und Begriff: That [...] "the essence of the arithmetical function 2x3+x is what is left when the x is taken away, i.e., in the above instance 2 (...) 3+ (...) [...] The argument x does not belong to the function but the two taken together make the whole". Russell agreed with Frege's notion of [...] "function" [...] in one sense: [...] "He regards functions – and in this <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> – as more fundamental than predicates and relations" [...] but Russell rejected Frege's [...] "theory of subject and assertion", in particular [...] "he thinks that, if a term a occurs in a proposition, the proposition can always be analysed into a and an assertion about a".|$|E
60|$|THE GENERAL. Sound sense, Lesbia. When a man talks rot, thats epigram: when {{he talks}} sense, then <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not often," [...] {{said the}} editor, [...] "but {{on this point}} <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> Cadging for {{advertisements}} isn't a woman's work." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> that {{it showed}} that more or less pique and {{irritation}} existed between the ladies, and told him how things stood, {{and that they were}} quarrelling over Incubu.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> really, and {{was thankful}} we hadn't {{a lot of}} smirking {{twitching}} girls and lasses in the audience. This male audience was so tense and pure in its attention.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{returned}} Brice, {{in equal}} astonishment, [...] "but you know <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> {{that we should}} work together to recover the money, and I must show him our good luck." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't hold with Mr. Jennings {{that you}} hid the Moonstone," [...] said Sergeant Cuff. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> {{that you must}} {{certainly}} have taken it back to your own room." ...|$|E
60|$|KEITH. [Impersonally] Deuced odd, {{the way a}} parson puts one's back up! Because {{you know}} <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> really; young Dunning ought to play the game; and I hope Sir William'll make him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{believe it}} is, at least, {{a mistake in}} policy to give the men no day of rest," [...] said Roswell, quietly. [...] "Though not {{prepared}} to carry matters {{as far as my}} friend Stephen here. <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> entirely in that." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{told the}} captain that <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> that the British were the scum of Europe, the westward drift {{of all the}} people, a disgusting rabble, and I lost three pounds by {{attenuated}} retail to Pollack at ha'penny nap and euchre.|$|R
60|$|Then, {{without waiting}} to learn whether <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> the lad led me {{forward by the}} arm with such a tight grip that I could not escape him save by a downright struggle, and knocked boldly {{at the door of}} the dwelling.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> who {{had noted}} Rezu's vast chest and {{swelling}} muscles, also {{the weight of}} the blows that he struck with the steel-hafted axe (which, by the way, when I sought for it, was missing, stolen, I suppose, by one of the Amahagger).|$|R
6000|$|... “She is, as Johnson says, sir, a square-rigged ship, and <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> {{as to the}} cut of her sails. She is {{certainly}} a Frenchman, and evidently a large frigate. She is running down the coast as we are, and I expect hopes {{to get through the}} Straits at night.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I did {{not notice}} it before," [...] Dick Caister said; [...] "but now Blount has pointed it out, <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> entirely. There are nothing like the full number of sheep have passed along here. I should {{say that they have}} not gone along {{more than two or three}} deep." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think it}} right to deceive Mamma," [...] said Fanny. [...] "I know him well enough to be quite sure {{that he will not}} take the title, as he has no {{property}} to support it. He has talked it over with me again and again, and <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> altogether." ...|$|E
60|$|My anxiety {{to examine}} the {{register}} did not dispose me to offer much encouragement to the old man's talkativeness. <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> that nobody could help the untidiness of the vestry, and then suggested that we should proceed to our business without more delay.|$|R
6000|$|... "He went {{on talking}} like that," [...] {{continued}} the captain, hastily, [...] "and out of politeness and good feeling <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> What else could I do? Then—I didn’t take much notice of it because, as I said, {{he was drinking}} whiskey—he—he sort of wondered why—why—" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> {{especially}} as <b>I</b> was feeling tired, being exhausted by wonder, and wanted time to think. So we turned back. As we did so I missed Tommy and inquired anxiously where he was, being afraid lest {{he might have}} tumbled down the well-like hole.|$|R
60|$|Ibid. Burnet, when a {{prosecution}} was commenced against Burnet in Scotland, he obtained naturalization {{for himself in}} Holland, after which he wrote to the Earl of Middleton, saying that:--being now naturalized in Holland, my allegiance was, during my stay in these parts, transferred from His Majesty to the States.--Swift. Civilians deny that, but <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Paul Ruttledge. There was a saint who said, [...] "I must rejoice without ceasing, {{although}} the world shudder at my joy." [...] He {{did not think}} he could save his soul without it. <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> and as I was discontented here, I thought it {{time to make a}} change. Like that worthy man, I must be content to shock my friends.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{suppose he}} could. You see, {{he went out}} under a cloud--took the whole window-sash with him, you might say--and I don't think the elders would welcome his relapse. Furthermore, he has embraced 'spiritism,' as he calls it, with both arms. By-the-way, professor, I've been talking about these psychic matters with Weissmann and others, and <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> that you're the very man to go into an {{investigation}} of these occult forces." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Everyone {{has heard}} of the case of Elizabeth Canning,' writes Mr. John Paget; and till {{recently}} <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> But {{five or six years}} ago the case of Elizabeth Canning repeated itself in a marvellous way, and then but few persons of my acquaintance had ever heard of that mysterious girl.|$|R
6000|$|... "Cheeko made me {{agree to}} come {{back as soon as}} possible, and, remembering that I had promised my wife some nice fresh lettuce from Mr. Man's garden that night for supper, <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> that if <b>I</b> didn't get my chores done up early, I'd send Sonny Bunny with the herb tea.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> silently. <b>I</b> suppose {{affections}} are, in a sense, to be learned. If {{there exists}} a native spark of love in all of us, it must be fanned while we are young. Hers, if she ever had it, had been drenched in as ugly a lot of corrosive liquid as could be imagined. But I was surprised at Fyne obscurely feeling this.|$|R
