40|$|Overview This product (a {{combination}} of a web report and <b>fact</b> sheets) focuses on the major causes of premature deaths—both overall, and among certain age groups. It explores current patterns and trends over time for premature deaths. The <b>fact</b> sheets, in particular, explore population-level approaches that target specific causes of premature death which {{may have contributed to}} improvements in death rates for some causes. Note that detailed supplementary tables and updated General Record of Incidence of Mortality (GRIM) books also accompany this release.

5|$|Errors as to {{precedent}} <b>facts,</b> {{sometimes called}} jurisdictional <b>facts,</b> in Singapore administrative law are errors committed by public authorities concerning <b>facts</b> that must objectively exist or not exist before the authorities {{have the power}} to take actions or make decisions under legislation. If an error concerning a precedent fact is made, the statutory power has not been exercised lawfully and may be quashed by the High Court if judicial review is applied for by an aggrieved person. The willingness of the Court to review such errors of fact is an exception to the general rule that the Court only reviews errors of law.|$|E
5|$|His {{antiquarian}} studies led Planché to take {{an interest}} in heraldry. He had published several papers on heraldic topics in the Journal of the British Archaeological Association before publishing in 1852 The Pursuivant of Arms, or, Heraldry founded upon <b>facts.</b> As indicated by the subtitle, Planché was concerned with verifiable <b>facts,</b> as opposed to the unfounded theories perpetuated by many earlier heraldic writers. In the view of eminent herald Sir Anthony Wagner, Planché rewrote the early history of heraldry.|$|E
5|$|I have {{a rather}} more {{favourable}} {{opinion of the}} 'Vestiges' than you appear to have. I do not consider it a hasty generalization, but rather as an ingenious hypothesis strongly supported by some striking <b>facts</b> and analogies, but which remains to be proven by more <b>facts</b> and the additional light which more research may throw upon the problem. It furnishes a subject for every student of nature to attend to; every fact he observes will make either for or against it, and it thus serves both as an incitement to the collection of <b>facts,</b> and an object to which they can be applied when collected.|$|E

5|$|A {{fundamental}} {{influence on}} Durkheim's {{thought was the}} sociological positivism of Auguste Comte, who effectively sought to extend and apply the scientific method found in the natural sciences to the social sciences. According to Comte, a true social science should stress for empirical <b>facts,</b> as well as induce general scientific laws from the relationship among these <b>facts.</b> There were many points on which Durkheim agreed with the positivist thesis. First, he accepted {{that the study of}} society was to be founded on an examination of <b>facts.</b> Second, like Comte, he acknowledged that the only valid guide to objective knowledge was the scientific method. Third, he agreed with Comte that the social sciences could become scientific only when they were stripped of their metaphysical abstractions and philosophical speculation. At the same time, Durkheim believed that Comte was still too philosophical in his outlook.|$|E

5|$|Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion for the Court, which declined to overturn the state court's decision because fair-minded jurists could disagree over whether Alvarado was in custody. Kennedy noted that there were <b>facts</b> for and against the claim that Alvarado was in custody. <b>Facts</b> pointing towards custody included that the interview took place at a police station, the interview lasted for two hours, Alvarado was not told {{he was free to}} leave, and Alvarado's parents were not allowed to be present during the interview. <b>Facts</b> weighing against custody included that Alvarado was not transported to the police station by police, Alvarado was not threatened or told he would be placed under arrest, and the interview focused on the crimes of Alvarado's friend, not Alvarado's crimes. The Court was not tasked with conducting a separate inquiry into the issue of custody, rather, the Court was tasked with granting relief only if the lower court's decision is objectively unreasonable. Kennedy wrote that, given this standard, the state court's decision was reasonable because it was not clearly unreasonable.|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe {{facilitates}} chromatin transcription (<b>FACT)</b> {{complex is}} involved in chromatin remodeling during transcription, replication, and DNA repair. <b>FACT</b> was previously considered to be ubiquitously expressed and not associated with any disease. However, we discovered that <b>FACT</b> is {{the target of a}} class of anticancer compounds and is not expressed in normal cells of adult mammalian tissues, except for undifferentiated and stem-like cells. Here, we show that <b>FACT</b> expression is strongly associated with poorly differentiated aggressive cancers with low overall survival. In addition, <b>FACT</b> was found to be upregulated during in vitro transformation and to be necessary, but not sufficient, for driving transformation. <b>FACT</b> also promoted survival and growth of established tumor cells. Genome-wide mapping of chromatin-bound <b>FACT</b> indicated that <b>FACT’s</b> role in cancer most likely involves selective chromatin remodeling of genes that stimulate proliferation, inhibit cell death and differentiation, and regulate cellular stress responses...|$|R
