5|$|Nevertheless, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> the battalion's key positions, {{including}} its officers, non commissioned officers (NCOs) and signallers, would initially be filled largely by New Zealanders of European descent.

5|$|On {{a council}} held in Constantinople on the {{relations}} with Bulgaria <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> {{the two countries}} should begin negotiations despite the calls for punishing the Bulgarians for the invasion. Michael Shishman divorced his wife Anna Neda and married Theodora Palaiologina, the 35-year-old widow of emperor Theodore Svetoslav. The exact reasons for that act are unclear. Many historians suggest that {{the deterioration of the}} Bulgarian-Serbian relations was rooted in the Serbian penetration in Macedonia. The marriage cemented the peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire but the need for an ally against the Serbs made Michael Shishman prone to make concessions. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> the border should follow the Philippopolis-Chernomen-Sozopol line. The agreement was finally signed in the autumn of 1324 and Michael Shishman spent the next several years at peace with his neighbors.|$|E
