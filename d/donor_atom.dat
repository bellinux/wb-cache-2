500|$|Due to {{the large}} ionic radius and great electropositivity of La3+, {{there is not much}} {{covalent}} contribution to its bonding and hence it has a limited coordination chemistry, like yttrium and the other lanthanides.

Low-frequency, S-band data are well-resolved for the M, = -I/* line in the gH region, and the number of lines is attributed to four approximately equivalent nitrogen <b>donor</b> <b>atoms.</b> When the pH is increased from 6. 8 to 7. 3, a second form is detected from the MI= line in the g,,re gion but not in other portions of the spectrum.

ADVANTAGE - The composition has superior bleaching compared to compositions not having the selected transition-metal bleach catalyst. The superiority in bleaching is obtained using very low levels of transition-metal bleach catalyst. It controls or kills microorganisms including bacteria, viruses, sub-viral particles, and molds; and destroys objectionable non-living proteins and/or peptides.

50|$|Ligands {{are also}} characterised by charge. Tetradentate ligands can be neutral, {{so that the}} charge of the whole complex {{is the same as}} the central atom. A tetradentate monoanionic (TMDA) ligand has one <b>donor</b> <b>atom</b> with a {{negative}} charge. A tetradentate dianionic ligand has a double negative charge, and tetradentate trianionic ligands have a triple negative charge. The maximal charge is on tetradentate tetraanionic ligands, which can stabilise metals in high oxidation states, however such ligands also have to resist oxidation to survive a strongly oxidising atom.|$|E
5000|$|Tripodal tetradentate ligands have a <b>donor</b> <b>atom</b> {{connected}} via three chains {{to other}} donor atoms. The {{top of the}} tripod is called the apex, and a <b>donor</b> <b>atom</b> in that position is apical, or {{also known as the}} bridging atom. The other three donor atoms are on the [...] "feet" [...] of the tripod. Examples can have three identical chains attached to an atom in tertiary arrangement. This atom could be nitrogen, phosphorus, or arsenic. Molecules containing phosphorus, or arsenic donor atoms remain stiff at the P or As and can hold their shape, unlike nitrogen compounds which rapidly racemize. If all the feet of the tripod are symmetrical and identical to each other, there will be only one way to attach in an octahedral coordination. However, there are two non-equivalent positions left on the central atom, so if two different monodentate, or an unsymmetrical bidentate ligand attaches there will be two possible isomers. If the feet differ then there are more isomers. When two feet are the same, and one is different there are three arrangements, two of which are enantiomers of each other. When there are three different legs, there are six possible isomers, but two are enantiomers of another pair, and two are symmetric.|$|E
50|$|Atoms {{with five}} {{coordinate}} positions are usually trigonal bipyramidal or square pyramid in shape. A symmetric tripodal tetradentate ligand can form two isomers on a square pyramid, {{depending on whether}} the briging donor is on the apex or the base of the pyramid. The extra vacant position on the square pyramid is on the base. Square pyramidal coordination tends to occur where a six-member ring is formed with the bridgehead, bridge, feet <b>donor</b> <b>atom</b> and central atom. The longer leg (with three bridging atoms) connects to the apex of the pyramid, and symmetry is lost.|$|E

50|$|Tetradentate ligands can be {{classified}} by the topology of the connections between the <b>donor</b> <b>atoms.</b> Common forms are linear (also called sequential), ring or tripodal.

40|$|In germanium, <b>donor</b> <b>atoms</b> migrate or form larger {{immobile}} clusters via {{their interaction}} with lattice vacancies. By engineering {{the concentration of}} free vacancies, {{it is possible to}} control the diffusion of the <b>donor</b> <b>atoms</b> and the formation of those larger clusters that lead to the deactivation of a significant proportion of the <b>donor</b> <b>atoms.</b> Electronic structure calculations in conjunction with mass action analysis are used to predict the concentrations of free vacancies and deactivated <b>donor</b> <b>atoms</b> in germanium doped with different proportions of arsenic and phosphorous. We find, for example, that at low temperatures, the concentration of free vacancies is partially suppressed by increasing the proportion of arsenic doping, whereas at high temperatures (above 1000 K), the concentration of free vacancies is relatively constant irrespective of the donor species. It is predicted that the free vacancy and active donor concentrations vary linearly with the arsenic to phosphorous ratio across a wide range of temperatures...|$|R
50|$|Superexchange (or Kramers-Anderson superexchange) is {{the strong}} (usually) antiferromagnetic {{coupling}} between two next-to-nearest neighbour cations through a non-magnetic anion. In this way, it differs from direct exchange {{in which there}} is coupling between nearest neighbor cations not involving an intermediary anion. Superexchange {{is a result of the}} electrons having come from the same <b>donor</b> <b>atom</b> and being coupled with the receiving ions' spins. If the two next-to-nearest neighbor positive ions are connected at 90 degrees to the bridging non-magnetic anion, then the interaction can be a ferromagnetic interaction.|$|E
50|$|A linear tetradentate ligand has its donor atoms {{arranged}} along or in a chain, so {{that each}} adjacent <b>donor</b> <b>atom</b> has to be adjacent on the central atom. This leads to three arrangements on a central atom in octahedral coordination. The chain can be in a circle surrounding the equator of the central atom. This is called trans because the remaining unoccupied positions on the octahedron are trans (opposite) to each other. The triangles formed by the coordinating atoms and the central atom are all coplanar. However the two remaining octahedral positions opposite each other may not be equivalent.|$|E

50|$|The poly-Pro I helix is much denser {{than the}} PPII helix {{due to the}} cis isomers of its peptide bonds. It is also rarer than the PPII {{conformation}} because the cis isomer is higher in energy than the trans. Its typical dihedral angles (-75°, 160°) are close, but not identical to, those of the PPII helix. However, the PPI helix is a right-handed helix and more tightly wound, with roughly 3.3 residues per turn (rather than 3). The rise per residue in the PPI helix is also much smaller, roughly 1.9 Å. Again, there is no internal hydrogen bonding in the poly-Pro I helix, both because an H-bond <b>donor</b> <b>atom</b> is lacking and because the amide nitrogen and oxygen atoms are too distant (roughly 3.8 Å again) and oriented incorrectly.|$|E
5000|$|Trace metals readily form {{complexes}} {{with major}} ions in the ocean, including hydroxide, carbonate, and chloride and their chemical speciation changes {{depending on whether}} the environment is oxidized or reduced. [...] Benjamin (2002) defines complexes of metals with more than one type of ligand, other than water, as mixed-ligand-complexes. In some cases, a ligand contains more than one <b>donor</b> <b>atom,</b> forming very strong complexes, also called chelates (the ligand is the chelator). One of the most common chelators is EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid), which can replace six molecules of water and form strong bonds with metals that have a plus two charge. [...] With stronger complexation, lower activity of the free metal ion is observed. One consequence of the lower reactivity of complexed metals compared to the same concentration of free metal is that the chelation tends to stabilize metals in the aqueous solution instead of in solids. Concentrations of the trace metals cadmium, copper, molybdenum, manganese, rhenium, uranium and vanadium in sediments record the redox history of the oceans. Within aquatic environments, cadmium(II) can either be in the form CdCl+(aq) in oxic waters or CdS(s) in a reduced environment. Thus higher concentrations of Cd in marine sediments may indicate low redox potential conditions in the past. For copper(II), a prevalent form is CuCl+(aq) within oxic environments and CuS(s) and Cu2S within reduced environments. The reduced seawater environment leads to two possible oxidation states of copper, Cu(I) and Cu(II). Molybdenum is present as the Mo(VI) oxidation state as MoO42−(aq) in oxic environments. Mo(V) and Mo(IV) are present in reduced environments in the forms MoO2+(aq) and MoS2(s). Rhenium is present as the Re(VII) oxidation state as ReO4− within oxic conditions, but is reduced to Re(IV) which may form ReO2 or ReS2. Uranium is in oxidation state VI in UO2(CO3)34−(aq) and is found in the reduced form UO2(s). Vanadium is in several forms in oxidation state V(V); HVO42− and H2VO4−. Its reduced forms can include VO2+, VO(OH)3−, and V(OH)3. These relative dominance of these species depends on pH.|$|E

40|$|Higher {{coordination}} by <b>donor</b> <b>atom</b> {{interaction in}} phosphites and phosphates has until recently been a relatively unstudied aspect of phosphorus chemistry. The complexes involved are postulated {{as models for}} enzyme-phosphate substrates in phosphoryl transfer systems. Donor atoms employed in these compounds include sulfur and oxygen, which are typically present in enzyme residues at active sites of phosphoryl transfer enzymes. The degree of <b>donor</b> <b>atom</b> coordination {{is measured by the}} distance between the central phosphorus atom and the <b>donor</b> <b>atom.</b> This is reinforced by a measurement of the degree of distortion of the tetrahedron toward trigonal bipyramidal structures (in the case of phosphates) and pseudo-trigonal bipyramidal structures (in the case of phosphites). ^ Hypercoordination by <b>donor</b> <b>atom</b> interaction in pentaoxyphosphoranes is well documented. Again, donor atoms used have included sulfur and oxygen. The degree to which the <b>donor</b> <b>atom</b> interacts with the phosphorus is obtained by measuring the distance between the two atoms and by the extent of distortion of the trigonal bipyramid toward an octahedral structure. These measurements are gathered from the molecular structures which are determined by X-ray crystallography. Other methods which are used for structure elucidation include 1 H and 31 P NMR spectroscopy. ^ Six phosphites are synthesized, five of which contain the highly electronegative pentafluorophenoxy group. The effect of this group and of the varying aryl substituents on the coordination abilities of sulfur and sulfonyl oxygen atoms is discussed. Also included for comparison are two phosphites which contain no <b>donor</b> <b>atom</b> coordination. ^ Three phosphates are synthesized, one of which contains a pentafluorophenoxy group. The effect on donor coordination by placing a phosphoryl oxygen atom in place of a lone pair in the analogous phosphite structure is discussed. ^ Twelve phosphoranes are synthesized, eight of which exhibit <b>donor</b> <b>atom</b> coordination and are octahedral while four shown no donor interaction and are trigonal bipyramidal. Of the hexacoordinate phosphoranes, five were prepared via oxidative addition of a quinone and two via displacement reactions of monocyclic pentaoxyphosphoranes. ^ Penta- and hexacoordinate phosphoranes are considered as models for activated states for phosphoryl transfer enzymes. The effect on reaction rate of tighter binding in the six-coordinate enzymatic transition state relative to both the five-coordinate transition state and the enzyme-phosphate substrate is discussed. The reactivities of a series of known oxyphosphoranes with respect to nucleophilic displacement by catechols is also described. The effect of varying substituents and extent of donor coordination on reaction rates are discussed. ...|$|E
