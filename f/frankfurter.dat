40|$|This study {{aimed to}} develop a new type of <b>frankfurters</b> through {{addition}} of chilli and kim chi spices. Development of meat product formulations like <b>frankfurters,</b> are highly desirable from a diet/health standpoint due to specific combinations of potential functional ingredients. The effect of chilli and kim chi spices at 0. 3 % on physicochemical and sensory properties was evaluated. The <b>frankfurters</b> with 0. 3 % chilli significantly improves the sensory properties, the <b>frankfurters</b> with chilli were appreciated with 7. 6 points, <b>frankfurters</b> with kim chi with 7. 4 points and classic <b>frankfurters</b> with 6. 7 points.

PUFA/SFA and n- 6 /n- 3 PUFA ratios in control sample were 0. 27 and 9. 27; in reformulated <b>frankfurters</b> the PUFA/SFA ratio was higher (1. 7) and the n- 6 /n- 3 PUFA ratio was lower (0. 47). In general, <b>frankfurters</b> had good fat and water binding properties. Colour parameters were affected by formulation and storage time. Compared to control sample, <b>frankfurters</b> made with oil-in-water emulsions had higher (p < 0. 05) hardness, springiness and chewiness values. Emulsified oil stabilizing systems did not affect sensory characteristics of <b>frankfurters,</b> and all products were judged as acceptable. © 2010 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyse the {{occurrence}} of Listeria species in <b>frankfurters</b> and hams products packed under vacuum and exhibited for sale in Mexicali, Baja California. One hundred and eighty-two packages of <b>frankfurters</b> and 72 of hams belonging to 17 commercial brands were collected randomly among packages exposed for sale, according to simple randomized sampling. The sampling was carried out between May and November. Positive samples of Listeria were submitted to biochemical tests in order to differentiate and confirm their species. Sixteen point five percent (42 / 254) presented some species of Listeria : 19. 2 % in <b>frankfurters</b> (35 / 182) and 9. 7 % in hams (7 / 72) products. L. monocytogenes was identified from 19 of 182 <b>frankfurters</b> and only 1 of 72 hams products analysed. Other species of Listeria were detected in 16 <b>frankfurters</b> samples (8. 8 %) and in 6 of the hams (8. 3 %). Presence of L. monocytogenes in these kinds of meat products, specifically <b>frankfurters</b> product, suggest inefficiency and inefficacy in the microbiological control programs during the process of elaboration.

40|$|Shelf-life of <b>frankfurters</b> {{depends on}} various {{factors such as}} its composition, {{packaging}} material and method used as well as the effect of external conditions (temperature). The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the shelf-life of packaged (vacuum, shrink and modified atmosphere, MA) chicken frank-furters during storage at different temperatures. For this purpose regular and with sodium lactate addition chicken <b>frankfurters</b> were produced. For MA packaging (MAP), under gas mixture of 70 % N 2 and 30 % CO 2, a package consisting of container and heat sealable cover was used. Different laminate composition was used for vacuum and shrink packaging of <b>frankfurters.</b> During <b>frankfurters</b> storage physico-chemical (pH, aw), and microbiological (aerobic mesophiles, lactic acid bacteria and total bacterial count) analyses were performed. Packaging materials were analyzed for their barrier characteristic (oxygen permeability). The shelf-life of <b>frankfurters</b> can be extended if packaged in MA (54 days) and shrink (45 days) packaging compared to 36 days of shelf-life in vacuum packaging, at 3 C. Higher shelf-life is obtained for frank-furters with lactate addition, in all packaging conditions, stored at 6 C...|$|R

40|$|Chilled (35 ± 3 °F) {{or frozen}} (0 ± 3 °F) all-natural beef and beef-buffalo <b>frankfurters</b> made {{with or without}} sodium nitrite (NaNO 2) were evaluated. Treatments {{included}} <b>frankfurters</b> made with: all-natural beef without NaNO 2 and displayed frozen (B 0 F); all-natural beef and buffalo without NaNO 2 and displayed frozen (BU 0 F); all-natural beef with NaNO 2 and displayed frozen (BNF) or chilled (BNC). Batter pH, smokehouse yield, and proximate analysis were determined. No differences (P>. 05) were noted in batter pH, smokehouse yield, proximate analysis, or cooking yield.

40|$|Technological {{properties}} and structural characteristics of proteins and lipids, using Raman spectroscopy, of <b>frankfurters</b> formulated {{with olive oil}} bulking agents as animal fat replacers were examined during chilling storage. <b>Frankfurters</b> reformulated with oil bulking agents showed lower (P < 0. 05) processing loss and higher (P < 0. 05) hardness and chewiness. Purge loss during chilling storage was relatively low, demonstrating a good water retention in the products. β-Sheet structures were enhanced {{by the use of}} olive oil bulking agents, and this effect was more pronounced in samples containing inulin. Reformulated <b>frankfurters</b> contained the least turns (P < 0. 05). A significant decrease of β-sheets and an increase of turns were observed after 85 days of chilled storage. The lowest (P < 0. 05) values of IνsCH 2 /IνasCH 2 were recorded in <b>frankfurters</b> reformulated with oil bulking agents, which suggests more lipid acyl chain disorder. Structural characteristics were correlated to processing losses, hardness, and chewiness. © 2014 American Chemical Society. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effect of}} carcass {{part on the}} {{acceptability}} of <b>frankfurters</b> made from mechani-cally deboned poultry meat (MDPM) was determined. The effect of fresh or frozen condition of the MDPM {{and the effect of}} days of storage on the finished franks were studied. Backs from which abdominal fat was removed and skinned necks were deboned separately and also in combination (5 : 1, w/w). <b>Frankfurters</b> were prepared from fresh and frozen lots of each type of MDPM. Protein, fat, water, and seasoning were held constant. The products were tested after 1 and 7 days of storage. Evaluation included organoleptic examination by a taste panel, shear values, yields, and proximate analyses. In general, fresh and frozen mechanically deboned backs and backs plus necks and fresh me-chanically deboned necks produced <b>frankfurters</b> with optimum texture (snappiness), tenderness, and juiciness. Franks made from frozen mechanically deboned necks were more mushy. Overall satisfaction scores were best for <b>frankfurters</b> prepared from fresh and frozen mechanically deboned backs and backs plus necks. Overall satisfaction scores for franks made from fresh and frozen mechanically deboned necks were lower, probably due to poor flavor. Shear values, although very little different, reflected tenderness data from the taste panel. There was little difference among yields or proximate analysis results for any of the <b>frankfurters...</b>|$|R
5|$|The Court reargued {{the case}} {{at the behest of}} Associate Justice Felix <b>Frankfurter,</b> who used reargument as a {{stalling}} tactic, to allow the Court to gather a consensus around a Brown opinion that would outlaw segregation. The justices in support of desegregation spent much effort convincing those who initially intended to dissent to join a unanimous opinion. Although the legal effect would be same for a majority rather than unanimous decision, it was felt that dissent could be used by segregation supporters as a legitimizing counter-argument.|$|E
