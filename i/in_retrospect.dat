5|$|Paul Winfield plays Reliant captain Clark Terrell; Meyer {{had seen}} Winfield's work in {{films such as}} Sounder and wanted to direct him. Meyer thought <b>in</b> <b>retrospect</b> that the Ceti eel scenes might have been corny, but felt that Winfield's {{performance}} helped add gravity.|$|E
5|$|The first Winter Games {{were held}} in 1924, in Chamonix, France.

5|$|The {{programme}} was {{notable for}} its combination of realistic spaceflight procedures, ensured by hiring BBC technical adviser James Burke, and its strong character-based writing.

5|$|Due to its {{originality}} and longevity, Winnie Winkle {{became a}} household name and an icon, inspiring even Pop Art artist Roy Lichtenstein. Winnie Winkle was reprinted in Dell Comics, {{and for a time}} her face appeared on a cigar box lid. <b>In</b> <b>retrospect,</b> Winnie Winkle is seen as one of the comic strips heralding a new, more independent role for American women after World War I.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>retrospect,</b> Newcomer commended Williams' {{management}} {{for taking a}} risk on him and the game. The game has garnered praise from industry professionals as well. Jeff Peters of GearWorks Games lauded the gameplay, describing it as unique and intuitive. Fusion Learning Systems' Jeff Johannigman praised the flapping mechanism and Kim Pallister of Microsoft enjoyed the multi-player aspect.|$|E

5|$|In the 1956 NBA draft, Boston Celtics coach Red Auerbach had set {{his sights}} on Russell, {{thinking}} his defensive toughness and rebounding prowess were the missing pieces the Celtics needed. <b>In</b> <b>retrospect,</b> Auerbach's thoughts were unorthodox. In that period, centers and forwards were defined by their offensive output, and their ability to play defense was secondary.|$|E
5|$|McKinsey & Company has {{traditionally}} charged approximately 25 {{percent more than}} competing firms with an average project of one million dollars.

5|$|The {{choice of}} de Castries {{as the local}} {{commander}} at Điện Biên Phủ was, <b>in</b> <b>retrospect,</b> a bad one. Navarre had picked de Castries, a cavalryman in the 18th-century tradition, because Navarre envisioned Điện Biên Phủ as a mobile battle. Điện Biên Phủ required someone adept at World War I-style trench warfare, something for which de Castries was not suited.|$|E

5|$|The low ratings doomed {{the show}} to a single season and, {{although}} admired, it has never developed a significant following among science fiction aficionados.

5|$|A MOS Technology 6502 {{chip that}} {{operates}} at 894kHz generates the sound effects, and a speech synthesizer by Votrax generates Q*bert's incoherent expressions. The audio system uses 128B of random-access memory and 4KB of erasable programmable {{read only memory}} to store the sound data and code to implement it. Like other Gottlieb games, the sound system was thoroughly tested to ensure it would handle daily usage. <b>In</b> <b>retrospect,</b> audio engineer David Thiel commented that such testing minimized time available for creative designing.|$|E
5|$|After {{recording}} drums, {{bass and}} most of the guitars, the band, Giordano and Parker moved to Water Music in Hoboken, New Jersey. The rest of the guitars and the vocals, strings and cowbells were recorded there, and recording was complete by April. Giordano, Parker and Ted Young mixed the recordings, and Ted Jensen did the mastering; Mike Sapone contributed programming to the songs. Girl Next Door String Quartet provided the strings, arranged by conductor Ray Zu-Artez (who played piano). Neil Rubenstein of These Enzymes and Nick Torres of Northstar contributed vocals to some songs. <b>In</b> <b>retrospect,</b> Fred Mascherino considered the sessions rushed.|$|E
5000|$|... (1) The {{need for}} some administrators using {{multicast}} access to reliably communicate with [...] "client" [...] computers on local subnet(s) by giving them fixed DHCP addresses (via the router) is not discussed in any User's Guide (although this used not to be necessary in earlier versions, and may be an unfixed bug). The view-only stand-alone [...] "Retrospect Dashboard" [...] application for Retrospect Windows is still {{not mentioned in the}} User's Guide as of March 2017. On the other hand, because the Retrospect Windows User's Guide is now substantially different from the Retrospect Macintosh User's Guide, there seem to be some problems keeping the updates in sync. For example, the Server Editions' capability of running two or more Scripts scheduled for the same time on the same [...] "backup server" [...] simultaneously is not discussed <b>in</b> the <b>Retrospect</b> Macintosh User's Guide—either the method of specifying different [...] "activity threads" [...] for the Scripts or the source-destination conflict analysis of all Scripts that are scheduled to run at the same time.

60|$|However, I {{can speak}} of it all now <b>in</b> quiet <b>retrospect</b> and without bitterness. It will soon be over now.

5|$|Broadcast {{during a}} strike that took ITV (the BBC's rival) off the air, City of Death scored high ratings. The fourth episode was watched by over sixteen million viewers, the highest UK {{television}} audience ever attained by {{an episode of}} Doctor Who. Although, <b>in</b> <b>retrospect,</b> it has been {{regarded as one of}} the best serials from Doctor Who classic run, the initial reception was not as positive, with criticism of the humorous tone.|$|E
5|$|By the 1950s, Keynesian {{policies}} were adopted by {{almost the entire}} developed world and similar measures for a mixed economy were used by many developing nations. By then, Keynes's views on the economy had become mainstream in the world's universities. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the developed and emerging free capitalist economies enjoyed exceptionally high growth and low unemployment. Professor Gordon Fletcher has written that the 1950s and 1960s, when Keynes's influence was at its peak, appear <b>in</b> <b>retrospect</b> as a golden age of capitalism.|$|E
5|$|Confronted by an openly hostile Byzantine Empire, {{and faced}} with the eventuality that the war with the Lombards would be renewed at the truce's expiration, Thurisind searched for new allies {{as a way to}} {{pressure}} Justinian. He found assistance from the Kutrigurs, who he ferried across the Danube into the Byzantine Illyricum in 550 or 551, before the truce expired and probably before the Gepids were ready to precipitate a new conflict. <b>In</b> <b>retrospect,</b> it may be they arrived too late instead of too early, if the agreement had been made with the Second Lombard–Gepid War in mind.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{that day}} 19th century much artistic {{progress}} {{has taken place}} in our coinage.

60|$|The sphere we have left, {{which we}} know is sordid, {{sometimes}} shines <b>in</b> the <b>retrospect.</b> And there came a time, after the excitement of furnishing the new house was over, when our heroine, as it were, swung {{for a time in}} space: not for a very long time; that month, perhaps, between autumn and winter.|$|R
60|$|I {{shall not}} go deeply into my college career, recalling only such {{incidents}} as, seen <b>in</b> the <b>retrospect,</b> {{appear to have}} had significance. I have mentioned my knack for song-writing; but it was not, I think, until my junior year there was startlingly renewed in me my youthful desire to write, to create something worth while, that had so long been dormant.|$|R
5|$|Critical {{reception}} to Dynamite Headdy was positive. Critics {{highlighted the}} game's originality and creativity in distinguishing it among other {{games in the}} action-platform genre. They also commended Treasure for demonstrating their technical expertise with impressive graphical effects and building {{on the success of}} their earlier game Gunstar Heroes (1993). In reviews from the time and <b>in</b> <b>retrospect,</b> Dynamite Headdy is cited for being one of the best games on the Genesis. An 8-bit port was released for Game Gear, which itself served as the basis for a Master System port released exclusively in Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} to Knuckles' Chaotix, both {{contemporary and}} <b>in</b> <b>retrospect,</b> has been mixed. Critics found the partner mechanic and tethering physics to be cumbersome, although many journalists appreciated Sega's attempt to innovate the series. The level design was also cited as poor by multiple publications. The game {{has been considered}} the last classic game of the Sonic series and a declining point. Some characters and concepts introduced in Knuckles' Chaotix were later featured in other Sonic games and media. Despite interest from fans, the game itself has not been re-released except {{for a brief period}} through GameTap in the 2000s.|$|E
5|$|Enter the Void was {{produced}} under Fidélité Films, with 70% {{of the budget}} invested by Wild Bunch. French co-producers included Noé's company Les Cinémas de la Zone and the visual effects studio BUF Compagnie. It received pre-sales investment from Canal+ and funding from Eurimages. Additional co-production support was provided by Essential Filmproduktion of Germany and BIM Distribuzione of Italy. The total budget was 12.38 million euro. <b>In</b> <b>retrospect,</b> Noé called Irréversible a bank robbery, a film made in order to finance Enter the Void. He also {{saw it as a}} helpful technical exercise.|$|E
60|$|The Doctor had now talked {{himself back}} into an admirable humour; {{and as he}} sat in the arbour and slowly imbibed a large {{allowance}} of white wine and picked a little bread and cheese with no very impetuous appetite, if a third of his meditations ran upon the missing treasure, the other two- thirds were more pleasingly busied <b>in</b> the <b>retrospect</b> of his detective skill.|$|R
