5|$|Caused {{in part by}} a drought, the Russian <b>famine</b> of 1921 was {{the most}} severe that the country had {{experienced}} since that of 1891, resulting in around five million deaths. The <b>famine</b> was exacerbated by government requisitioning, as well as the export of large quantities of Russian grain. To aid the <b>famine</b> victims, the US government established an American Relief Administration to distribute food; Lenin was suspicious of this aid and had it closely monitored. During the <b>famine,</b> Patriarch Tikhon called on Orthodox churches to sell unnecessary items to help feed the starving, an action endorsed by the government. In February 1922 Sovnarkom went further by calling on all valuables belonging to religious institutions to be forcibly appropriated and sold. Tikhon opposed the sale of items used within the Eucharist and many clergy resisted the appropriations, resulting in violence.|$|E
5|$|<b>Famine</b> {{is shaped}} by {{generally}} two theories. The first is FAD, Food Availability Decline. This {{is the result of}} a drought, a war, or some other drastic change to the agricultural system. This is the natural cause for <b>famine.</b> The other theory deals primarily with the population’s ability to access or become entitled to food. In this case, food power makes itself known on a small scale, as opposing political forces in Sudan compete for the votes of the people by instigating or encouraging the <b>famine.</b>|$|E

5|$|For example, Sudan’s <b>famine</b> in the 1980s was {{completely}} intentional, {{and was only}} a pawn for a varied collection of different elites to improve their political and economic statuses. These political parties weren’t the only beneficiaries, though. Merchants were also known to hoard grain and buy livestock at inappropriately low prices when the famines shifted the terms of trade. Western Sudanese merchants during the <b>famine</b> of 1987 were described as heartless because they refused to sell grain to needy villages in Darfur at reasonable prices. Ergo, the Sudanese <b>Famine</b> was another example of food power in which food was and used as a policy, and which completely ignored {{the needs of the}} people and fostered the political and power-hungry intentions of opposite warring forces in the country.|$|E
5|$|Indian {{agriculture}} is {{heavily dependent on}} the monsoon {{as a source of}} water. In some parts of India, the failure of the monsoons results in water shortages, resulting in below-average crop yields. This is particularly true of major drought-prone regions such as southern and eastern Maharashtra, northern Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Western Orissa, Gujarat, and Rajasthan. In the past, droughts have periodically led to major Indian famines. These include the Bengal <b>famine</b> of 1770, in which up to one third of the population in affected areas died; the 1876–1877 <b>famine,</b> in which over five million people died; the 1899 <b>famine,</b> in which over 4.5 million died; and the Bengal <b>famine</b> of 1943, in which over five million died from starvation and famine-related illnesses.|$|E

50|$|Amartya Sen {{argues in}} his book Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation (1980) that {{population}} expansion fails to cause <b>famines</b> or degradation as Malthusians or Neo-Malthusians argue. Instead, in documented cases a lack of political entitlement to resources that exist in abundance, causes <b>famines</b> in some populations. He documents how <b>famines</b> can occur {{even in the midst}} of plenty or in the context of low populations. He argues that <b>famines</b> (and environmental degradation) would only occur in non-functioning democracies or unrepresentative states.|$|R
50|$|Speakman’s {{critique}} of the thrifty gene hypothesis {{is based on an}} analysis of the pattern and level of mortality during <b>famines.</b> Despite much anecdotal evidence used to suggest that <b>famines</b> cause substantial mortality, Speakman suggests that where real data are available <b>famines</b> actually involve rather low levels of mortality and {{there is no evidence that}} fat people survive <b>famines</b> better than lean people. In fact mortality actually falls mostly on groups such as the very young and very old where differential mortality in relation to body composition is highly unlikely.|$|R
50|$|The {{conventional}} explanation until 1951 for {{the cause}} of <b>famines</b> was the decline of food availability (abbreviated as FAD for food availability decline). The assumption was that the central cause of all <b>famines</b> was a decline in food availability. However this does not explain why only a certain section of the population such as the agricultural laborer was affected by <b>famines</b> while others were insulated from them.|$|R
5|$|The Little Ice Age caused crop {{failures}} and famines in Europe. The 1690s saw the worst <b>famine</b> in France since the Middle Ages. Finland suffered a severe <b>famine</b> in 1696–1697, during which {{about one-third of}} the Finnish population died.|$|E
5|$|There {{were times}} when people used to gather below the jharokha window to hold protest demonstrations to place their grievances before the emperor.

5|$|Two large famines {{occurred}} in Madras during this period, the Great <b>Famine</b> of 1876–78 and the Indian <b>famine</b> of 1896–97. As a result, {{the population of}} the Presidency fell for the first time from 31.2 million in 1871 to 30.8 million in 1881. These famines and alleged partiality shown by the government in handling the Chingleput Ryots' Case and the Salem riots trial caused discontent among the population.|$|E
50|$|<b>Famines</b> {{continued}} {{throughout the}} 20th century. Through {{the effects of}} climactic events, government policy, war and crop failure, millions of people died in each of at least ten <b>famines</b> between the 1920s and the 1990s.|$|R
5000|$|Food {{shortages}} {{in a population}} are caused either {{by a lack of}} food or by difficulties in food distribution; it may be worsened by natural climate fluctuations and by extreme political conditions related to oppressive government or warfare. The conventional explanation until 1981 for the cause of <b>famines</b> was the Food availability decline (FAD) hypothesis. The assumption was that the central cause of all <b>famines</b> was a decline in food availability. However, FAD could not explain why only a certain section of the population such as the agricultural laborer was affected by <b>famines</b> while others were insulated from <b>famines.</b> Based on the studies of some recent <b>famines,</b> the decisive role of FAD has been questioned and {{it has been suggested that}} the causal mechanism for precipitating starvation includes many variables other than just decline of food availability. According to this view, <b>famines</b> are a result of entitlements, the theory being proposed is called the [...] "failure of exchange entitlements" [...] or FEE. A person may own various commodities that can be exchanged in a market economy for the other commodities he or she needs. The exchange can happen via trading or production or through a combination of the two. These entitlements are called trade-based or production-based entitlements. Per this proposed view, <b>famines</b> are precipitated due to a breakdown in the ability of the person to exchange his entitlements. An example of <b>famines</b> due to FEE is the inability of an agricultural laborer to exchange his primary entitlement, i.e., labor for rice when his employment became erratic or was completely eliminated.|$|R
25|$|<b>Famines</b> {{have been}} {{frequent}} in world history. Some have killed millions and substantially diminished {{the population of}} a large area. The most common causes have been drought and war, but the greatest <b>famines</b> in history were caused by economic policy.|$|R

50|$|The {{result of}} the {{epidemic}} was that southern Busoga, its most densely populated area, was virtually uninhabited. Other areas affected by sleeping sickness, including eastern Bukooli and Busiki, were depopulated as well. <b>Famines</b> also triggered substantial population movements. Parts of northeastern Busoga and the adjacent Bukandi district (across the Mpologoma River) experienced <b>famines</b> in 1898-1900, 1907, 1908, 1917, 1918 and 1944. Populations in these areas shrank; many people {{were killed by the}} <b>famines,</b> and survivors moved to other areas for safety.|$|R
50|$|Even {{though the}} {{theories}} of Thomas Malthus would predict that <b>famines</b> {{reduce the size of}} the population commensurate with available food resources, in fact even the most severe <b>famines</b> have rarely dented population growth {{for more than a few}} years. The mortality in China in 1958-61, Bengal in 1943, and Ethiopia in 1983-85 was all made up by a growing population over just a few years. Of greater long-term demographic impact is emigration: Ireland was chiefly depopulated after the 1840s <b>famines</b> by waves of emigration.|$|R
5|$|The Great <b>Famine</b> of 1315 began {{a number}} of acute crises in the English agrarian economy. The <b>famine</b> centred on a {{sequence}} of harvest failures in 1315, 1316 and 1321, combined with an outbreak of murrain, a sickness amongst sheep and oxen in 1319–21 and the fatal ergotism, a fungus amongst the remaining stocks of wheat. Many {{people died in the}} ensuing <b>famine,</b> and the peasantry were said to have been forced to eat horses, dogs and cats as well as conducted cannibalism against children, although these last reports are usually considered to be exaggerations. Poaching and encroachment on the royal forests surged, sometimes on a mass scale. Sheep and cattle numbers fell by up to a half, significantly reducing the availability of wool and meat, and food prices almost doubled, with grain prices particularly inflated. Food prices remained at similar levels for the next decade. Salt prices also increased sharply due to the wet weather.|$|E
5|$|The {{first years}} of the 14th century were marked by famines, {{culminating}} in the Great <b>Famine</b> of 1315–17. The causes of the Great <b>Famine</b> included the slow transition from the Medieval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age, which left the population vulnerable when bad weather caused crop failures. The years 1313–14 and 1317–21 were excessively rainy throughout Europe, resulting in widespread crop failures. The climate change—which resulted in a declining average annual temperature for Europe during the 14th century—was accompanied by an economic downturn.|$|E
5|$|The great <b>Famine</b> of 1866–68, and the {{distrust}} and discontent {{concerning the}} way the establishment distributed the relief help, is estimated to have contributed greatly to the raising Swedish emigration to the United States.|$|E

50|$|The direct {{reasons for}} <b>famines</b> are often given as bad weather and blights (in {{particular}} potato blight); however {{there are also}} major social factors which caused <b>famines</b> in Galicia to be more likely, and to have more serious consequences than in {{many other parts of}} Europe.|$|R
