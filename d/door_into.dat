On 14 April 2001, the final show from TC 6 at BBC Television Centre was broadcast before the show moved to 'Studio A' in BBC Scotland the following week, which at the time, was based on Queen Margaret Drive, Glasgow. It then remained there {{until the end of}} its run.|$|E
5|$|Leeds Parish Church, rebuilt and reconsecrated in 1841 {{after an}} {{elaborate}} ceremony, was of almost cathedral size, {{the centre of}} a huge parish ministered by many curates. Lang's district was the Kirkgate, {{one of the poorest}} areas, many of whose 2,000inhabitants were prostitutes. Lang and his fellow curates fashioned a clergy house from a derelict public house. He later moved next <b>door,</b> <b>into</b> a condemned property which became his home for his remaining service in Leeds. In addition to his normal parish duties, Lang acted temporarily as Principal of the Clergy School, was chaplain to Leeds Infirmary, and took charge of a men's club of around a hundred members. On 24 May 1891 he was ordained to full priesthood.|$|E
5|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature of}} the Wootton Hall is its pair of Italian black and Beschia marble blackamoor torchères, originally given to the First Duke of Marlborough as a present from General Charles Churchill. In exceptionally good condition, they stand {{either side of the}} <b>door</b> <b>into</b> the Saloon. These were discovered in the silt of the River Tiber and are depictions of slaves who once served in a Roman household. Several flags stand above them, including the White Ensign. The ceiling is intricately made, featuring flowers in the plaster, each one different, the work of Colen Campbell in the early 18th century. The black and white check marble floor is also a distinguishing {{feature of the}} room, but through most of its history this floor would have been left plain as horses and carriages would enter the hall inside. In the mid 19th century Frederick, the 4th Earl, had laid down brown and blue tiles, replaced by the marble floor which was added by his son Robert in around 1910. The floor gives significant depth to the hall and provides fine acoustics, so much that Diana would once practice her tap dancing in the hall as a teenager.|$|E

25|$|The third {{match was}} between Crowbar and Terry Funk for the WCW Hardcore Championship. The match started when Funk ambushed Crowbar backstage. They fought inside a truck, and Funk sent Crowbar through {{a table with}} a hip toss. Crowbar {{attacked}} Funk with a car door, and slammed a <b>door</b> <b>into</b> Funk's head. Funk performed a low blow, and slammed the <b>door</b> <b>into</b> Crowbar's head repeatedly. Funk handcuffed Crowbar, and attacked him with the car door and a steel chair. Crowbar fought back with the chair, and performed a slingshot splash to Funk through a table. Funk fought back with chair shots, and pinned Crowbar after a piledriver on the car door to win the match and the title.|$|E

Two types of Orlit posts existed, the Orlit ‘A’ was at ground level and the Orlit ‘B’ was raised 6ft on four legs with a ladder for access.|$|E

25|$|In 1966, Faber and Faber {{published}} {{his first major}} volume, called Death of a Naturalist. This collection was met with much critical acclaim and won several awards, including the Gregory Award for Young Writers and the Geoffrey Faber Prize. Also in 1966, Heaney was appointed as a lecturer in Modern English Literature at Queen's University Belfast. That year his first son, Michael, was born. A second son, Christopher, was born in 1968. That same year, with Michael Longley, Heaney {{took part in a}} reading tour called Room to Rhyme, which increased awareness of the poet's work. In 1969, his second major volume, <b>Door</b> <b>into</b> the Dark, was published.|$|E

At the right edge, a young white woman in a refined white dress steps over a threshold from the house next <b>door</b> <b>into</b> this world, with another black figure behind her. (She is Johnson's sister.) An adult black woman looks out an upstairs window as she steadies a small light-skinned child sitting on the partially collapsed roof. The woman dancing with the child in the middle foreground has the darkest skin; nearly each individual is painted with a different skin tone.|$|E
25|$|Privates Horrigan, John Williams, Joseph Williams {{and other}} {{patients}} {{tried to hold}} the hospital entrance with rifles and fixed bayonets. Joseph Williams defended a small window, and 14 dead Zulus were later found beneath that window. As it became clear {{the front of the}} building was being taken over by Zulus, John Williams began to hack a way of escape through the wall dividing the central room and a corner room {{in the back of the}} hospital. As he made a passable breach, the <b>door</b> <b>into</b> the central room came under furious attack from the Zulus, and he only had time to drag two bedridden patients out before the door gave way.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} these alleys have no names and some have {{whimsical}} names such as “Sal si puedes” (Exit if you can). Another famous alley is the Callejon Oacuten, through which Ignacio Allende and Miguel Hidalgo entered with their army in 1810. One alley near the State Government Palace is called the Callejón de la Condesa (Alley of the Countess). The name comes from the lady {{of one of the}} mansions who lived there in the very late 18th and very early 19th centuries. Ashamed of her husband’s bad reputation with other women, before and after the marriage, the Countess began to enter and leave her home through the back <b>door</b> <b>into</b> this alley to avoid the glances of the townspeople.|$|E

25|$|The teacher's {{house had}} three levels {{and apart from}} ornate {{external}} stone carving was similar in size and features to the workmen's cottages. The basement contained a storage cellar, pantry and space for a WC. As with the houses and school building it is not certain that any WC's were actually installed. The ground floor contained two living rooms, one with a sink, range and access to a private yard. An entrance hall opened to the stair hall. At the mezzanine landing of the stair was a <b>door</b> <b>into</b> the school corridor. On the first floor there were two bedrooms, each with a fireplace, and a smaller bedroom in the clock tower. Flues from the four fireplaces were carried to a single central chimney stack supported by an arch (hidden in the roof space) across the stair hall. This was unusual and expensive form of construction, but visually impressive.|$|E
25|$|Harvey and Eliza Sutton died in 1952, and in 1960 Dr. J. Harold Donaldson {{purchased}} the house. Donaldson converted the structure into his medical clinic, making numerous further alterations counter to Wright's design. These included constructing a small brick addition {{on the north}} (rear) side {{for use as a}} diagnostic clinic, replacing the original roof with asphalt shingles, and blocking the original entrance into the reception room, using instead the previously private veranda <b>door</b> <b>into</b> what had been the living room. Donaldson also erected a wall of decorative concrete block around the entire property that incorporated lily pools, fish ponds, statues, and fountains featuring cherubs pouring water from vases. However, the changes that were most damaging to the historical fabric of the house involved filling in doors, cutting through oak floors, and adding walls to divide the flowing, interconnected interior into 24 small rooms.|$|E
25|$|Barrett {{was talking}} to the second engineer, Mr. Hesketh, when the red light and bells came on {{signalling}} the order to stop the engines. He shouted to the men in the boiler room to shut the dampers, the doors to the furnaces and to shut off the wind for the fires. Then he felt a crash and water came pouring in on him from a large tear in the ship's starboard side. Barrett made his way through the water tight <b>door</b> <b>into</b> boiler room 5. He was ordered to go back into boiler room 6, but there was 8 feet of water there. As some of the engineers attended the pumps, the engine room rang for all the stokers to go up on deck. Barrett was ordered to stay behind by an engineer, Mr. Harvey, in boiler room 5 to get some lamps, draw fires, and lift the manhole plate until water started to rush in.|$|E
