When they started the crane's engine, the <b>engine</b> <b>vibrations</b> sent the crane toppling backwards into the water. One man, John Gibson, jumped clear.

25|$|Although now obsolescent, the Idflieg {{accepted}} the Forssman into service in April 1916 as a trainer. Further {{development of the}} design was halted, although the aircraft's ballast was moved to counter tail heaviness that Steffen encountered on the acceptance flight. Shortly after acceptance, the aircraft's fuselage fractured just aft of the wings, due to <b>engine</b> <b>vibrations</b> while running the engines on the ground. The Forssman was dismantled at that point, and Bruno Steffen expressed relief at the news, as the aircraft {{would not be able}} to endanger other lives.|$|E
25|$|The first Bf 109 in serial production, the Bf 109 B-1, {{was fitted}} with the 670PS (661hp, 493kW) Jumo 210D engine driving a two-bladed {{fixed-pitch}} propeller. During the production run a variable-pitch propeller was introduced and often retrofitted to older aircraft; these were then unofficially known as B-2s. The Bf 109B saw combat with the Legion Condor during the Spanish Civil War, {{although it was}} apparent that the armament was still inadequate. Several aircraft were produced with an engine-mounted machine gun but it was very unreliable, most likely because of <b>engine</b> <b>vibrations</b> and overheating. Thus the Bf 109 V8 was constructed to test the fitting of two more machine guns in the wings; however, results showed that the wing needed strengthening. In the following V9 prototype, both wing guns were replaced by 20mm MG FF cannons.|$|E

2500|$|On 28 June 1943, {{the first}} Tempest Mk.II, LA602, flew {{powered by a}} Centaurus IV (2,520hp/1,879kW) driving a four-blade propeller. LA602 {{initially}} flew with a Typhoon-type fin and rudder unit. This {{was followed by the}} second, LA607, which was completed with the enlarged dorsal fin and first flew on 18 September 1943: LA607 was assigned to engine development. The first major problem experienced during the first few flights was serious <b>engine</b> <b>vibrations,</b> which were cured by replacing the rigid, eight-point engine mountings with six-point rubber-packed shock mounts. In a further attempt to alleviate engine vibration, the four blade propeller was replaced with a five blade unit; eventually, a finely balanced four bladed unit was settled on. Problems were also experienced with engine overheating, poor crankshaft lubrication, exhaust malfunctions and reduction-gear seizures. Because of these problems, and because of the decision to [...] "tropicalise" [...] all Tempest IIs for service in the South-East Asian theatre, production was delayed.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} quantitatively the {{influence}} of water emulsified fuel on combustion, <b>engine</b> <b>vibration</b> and noise, {{and the effect of}} ignition improver on the reduction of vibration and noise. The main conclusions obtained are as follows : (1) With an increase in the water addition rate, ignition delays and the maximum pressure rise rate increases. As a result, <b>engine</b> <b>vibration</b> and noise increase, in proportion to the pressure rise rate. (2) An increase in ignition delay with the addition of water is closely related to the heat quantity required to evaporate water in the fuel spray under a high temperature and high pressure condition.

2500|$|For the 2009 {{model the}} G35 sedan was {{replaced}} by the G37 sedan. The G37 sedan was first unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show for the European market. Exterior, interior and options remain identical to the 2008 G35 model range but the sedan now also sports the 3.7-liter VQ37VHR [...] "VVEL" [...] V6, rated [...] at 7,000 rpm and [...] at 5,200 rpm that was previously introduced in the G37 Coupe. Although the engine gains only [...] torque over the VQ35HR and this torque value arrives at a later 5,200 rpm vs. 4,800 in the VQ35HR, the torque curve itself is improved and flattened across the rpm range via Nissan's new VVEL (Variable Valve Event and Lift) variable valve timing resulting in better throttle response and low rpm torque. The G37s VQ37VHR engine has been touted by car magazines and reviewers as an improvement over the VQ35HR engine mostly adding much more refinement and smoother engine operation, especially at high rpm where the VQ35HR engine was frequently criticized for NVH and sounding strained, harsh and loud.

2500|$|A {{deliberate}} attempt to introduce [...] "modern car lines", the Mark E introduced semi-monocoque construction, both {{to improve the}} resilience {{of the car and}} to allow full-height doors to be fitted on both sides. As announced, the prototype car was completely flat-sided and as with previous models used light alloy for all exterior panels. Beneath the skin, there were two main steel frames, one which made up the principle support for the floor, rear suspension and doors and a second which carried the steering assembly and engine. This second frame was described as [...] "semi-floating" [...] to allow the damping out of <b>engine</b> <b>vibrations</b> and to prevent fractures. Further strength was obtained by separating the bonnet from the front grill, allowing the grill frame to add rigidity {{to the front of the}} car. Track and overall width of the car were the same as the Mark D, but the wheelbase was extended by [...] Though not appreciated at the time, this fundamentally affected the car's stability and made it liable to overturn. Weather protection was more sophisticated, the hood now including a front section that could be rolled back as a sunroof while the detachable side screens incorporate sliding windows. The seat was still a single bench, but the backrest was now split, one third allowing for adjustment to suit driver comfort, whilst the remainder hinged forward to allow access to the boot. Lighting was improved with larger headlamps, flashing indicators and rear number plate light. The fuel tank was increased in size to , but the car retained the Villiers 9E/3 engine with three-speed gearbox. Deliveries of the new car were expected to begin in May 1957.|$|E

Both versions were plagued by reliability issues worse than with the DFV they were supposed to replace. [...] The 3.3 L version powered Rondeau to the second points standing in the World Sportscar Championship season of 1982, but it was insufficiently reliable to be competitive in the longer events. [...] Thereafter, the 3.3 L DFL in the C1 class was unsuccessful, with those who managed to actually finish invariably ending up behind C2 cars. [...] The new fuel-restricted C Junior (C2) class in 1983 opened a niche for successful use of the 3.3 L version, where low power tuning brought its reliability to a level where it could succeed. In the C2 category it powered many privateer cars, mostly Spices and Tigas, to class victories around the world, including five at the 24 Hours of Le Mans between 1985 and 1990. [...] The 3.9 L version never achieved the same success as its smaller sibling, with most users finding incurable <b>engine</b> <b>vibrations</b> and it was out of competition use by 1985. It was used to power the famous Ford Supervan and Supervan 2 promotional projects, as well as the Australian designed and built Romano WE84 in the Australian Sports Car Championship, which ran the 3.0 L DFV in the championship before upgrading to the 3.9 L DFL for the 1984 World Endurance Championship round at the Sandown Raceway in Melbourne, where it finished 100 laps behind the class winner.|$|E

The first model is conventional elastomeric {{engine mounting system}} comprising elastic, viscous and friction functional components which expresses the nonlinear behaviour of the dynamic stiffness and damping of the engine mounts as functions of both the frequency and amplitude of excitation. The second model is based on adding actuators, sensors and a controller to the elastomeric mounts making the engine mounting system an adaptronic one.
