25|$|Ferdinand Porsche {{designed}} and built a four-wheel-driven electric vehicle for the k. u. k. Hofwagenfabrik Ludwig Lohner & Co. in Vienna in 1899, presented to the public during the 1900 World Exhibition in Paris. The vehicle was a series hybrid car, that used an electric <b>hub</b> <b>motor</b> at each wheel, powered by batteries, which were in turn charged by a gasoline-engine generator. It was clumsily heavy and due to its unusual status the so-called Lohner-Porsche is not frequently given its credit as the first four-wheel-driven automobile.|$|E
25|$|In 1939, the American bolt-on Whizzer gas-engined bicycle kit was introduced, {{utilizing}} a 138cc side-valve four-stroke engine, the first whizzer {{was of the}} friction drive variety, but was soon replaced with belt drive. Despite some initial engine reliability issues, the Whizzer enjoyed modest popularity during World War II due to fuel and automobile shortages, and was used by war plant workers and others with priority for transportation. After the war, the Whizzer became popular with youth who desired faster speeds from their heavy cruiser-framed Schwinn bicycles. In 1949, the company introduced a complete production bike, the Pacemaker. Sales of the Whizzer conversion kits continued until 1962. In the United Kingdom, the motorized bicycle saw a resurgence of popularity and such bolt-on motors as the Cyclaid and the Cyclemaster motor wheel saw brief periods of immense popularity. The Cyclemaster, which was a <b>hub</b> <b>motor</b> that could be fitted to an ordinary bike, started at 25cc (painted black), but later the size went up to 32cc (painted grey).|$|E
2500|$|... {{the front}} or rear wheel may be powered {{directly}} by a motor {{built into the}} hub (e.g. Singer Motor Wheel, Copenhagen Wheel). This avoids the need to transfer power to wheel by some other means. The downside of this system is that often, the original wheel must be replaced for the wheel with the <b>hub</b> <b>motor.</b>|$|E
50|$|Eventually {{the growth}} in power of the {{gasoline}} engine overtook {{the power of the}} electric wheel <b>hub</b> <b>motors</b> and this made up for any losses through a transmission. As a result, autos moved to gasoline engines with transmissions, but they were never as efficient as electric wheel <b>hub</b> <b>motors.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{two most}} common types of <b>hub</b> <b>motors</b> used in {{electric}} bicycles are brushed and brushless. There are many possible types of electric motorized bicycles with several technologies available, varying in cost and complexity; direct-drive and geared motor units are both used. An electric power-assist {{system may be}} added to almost any pedal cycle using chain drive, belt drive, <b>hub</b> <b>motors</b> or friction drive. BLDC <b>hub</b> <b>motors</b> are a common modern design with the motor built into the wheel hub itself and the stator fixed solidly to the axle and the magnets attached to and rotating with the wheel. The bicycle wheel <b>hub</b> is the <b>motor.</b> The power levels of motors used are influenced by available legal categories and are often, but not always limited to under 750 watts.|$|R

50|$|A frock motor is a <b>hub</b> <b>motor</b> {{frequently}} {{fitted to}} electric bicycles. Unlike belt or chain driven motors which can pose a hazardous entanglement risk to those wearing long or loose garments, the <b>hub</b> <b>motor</b> is laced {{into the center}} of the bicycle's wheel. With no fast moving parts near the rider's legs it poses little threat to those wearing frock-like garments. Frock motors are either internally geared or direct drive and come in various sizes depending on their power output. They are the most common type of electric bicycle motor and are fitted to millions of bicycles throughout China and around the world.|$|E

50|$|A direct rotor <b>hub</b> <b>motor</b> may {{feature a}} {{regenerative}} brake, {{so it can}} be used as a brake that converts some of the kinetic energy into battery charge. In addition to charging the battery when braking this incurs less wear on the traditional brake, reducing braking noises.|$|E

50|$|Pierre Couture, a Canadian {{inventor}} and engineer, {{has developed}} a wheel <b>hub</b> <b>motor</b> in 1982.

40|$|To {{optimize}} the {{energy efficiency and}} to reduce the CO 2 -emissions in the railway transport area new vehicle concepts are needed. Regarding the drive concept for high-speed trains the question of using wheel <b>hub</b> <b>motors</b> always comes back into the discussion. Especially for low-floor vehicles or double-deck vehicles {{it is likely to}} use the space, which is now taken by the chassis, {{to use it as a}} walk-through area. The distribution of the drive power between several axes represents another advantage. In this paper basic considerations for the design of wheel <b>hub</b> <b>motors</b> for high speed trains with electrically excited synchronous machines are carried out...|$|R
50|$|Regenerative braking is also {{possible}} on a non-electric bicycle. The EPA, working with students from the University of Michigan, developed the hydraulic Regenerative Brake Launch Assist (RBLA).It is naturally available on electric bicycles with direct-drive <b>hub</b> <b>motors.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some velomobiles {{have been}} {{converted}} to provide electric assist. Electric assist means that a small battery-operated electric-propulsion system is provided to assist the driver's leg muscle effort. Most electric-assist propulsion motors are of the in-wheel design in the rear wheel, such as geared <b>hub</b> <b>motors</b> (like eZee, Heinzmann, Bafang, BMC, etc.) and direct-drive <b>hub</b> <b>motors</b> (like Crystalyte, BionX, 9Continent, etc.) but mid-drive units (like Sunstar, Cyclone, Ecospeed, etc.) are used as well due to design constraints in velomobile models with one-sided rear wheel mounting like the Quest, Strada and Mango or front wheel drive in the Velayo, or better efficiency by using the multiple speeds of the chain drive or internal geared hubs (e.g. Rohloff 14 speed hub).|$|R
5000|$|In a {{parallel}} hybrid bicycle human and motor torques are mechanically coupled at the pedal {{or one of}} the wheels, e.g. using a <b>hub</b> <b>motor,</b> a roller pressing onto a tire, or a connection to a wheel using a transmission element. Most motorized bicycles, mopeds are of this type.|$|E
5000|$|Diesel wheel motor: Not all {{wheel hub}} motors were electric. C F Goddard in 1896 invented a piston <b>hub</b> <b>motor</b> for horseless {{carriages}} patented in US # 574,200.
