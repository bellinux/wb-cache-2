40|$|In recent years, the {{lifetime}} of an insulated railroad joint in the field has decreased due to increasing wheel loads. The goal {{of this research is}} to investigate possible changes in insulated rail joint design in order to improve the performance of the <b>insulated</b> <b>joint.</b> The finite element program ABAQUS is used to model the supported butt joint. In this model, the rail, joint bars, epoxy, and ties surrounding the joint are modeled using solid elements. The remaining ties are modeled as an elastic foundation. The rail is subjected to a tensile load, as well as a vertical wheel load that is applied to the rail using Hertz contact theory. Parametric studies are performed by varying the tie width, joint bar length, and joint bar dimensions. Two different wheel load locations are also investigated: centered about the end post, and halfway between the tie under the end post and the tie just {{to the left of the}} end post. The vertical displacement of the rail and <b>insulated</b> <b>joint</b> is one measure used to determine the effect of the parameters on the <b>insulated</b> <b>joint.</b> However, since the most common cause of failure in insulated rail joints is the debonding of the epoxy, this research also focuses on the stresses present in the epoxy when the joint is subjected to a static wheel load.

40|$|Bonded (glued) {{insulated}} rail joints {{are widely used}} in continuously welded railroad track. These joints frequently develop problems in which the epoxy debonds from the fishing surfaces of the rail and joint bars, leading to problems such as pull-aparts and electrical failures. <b>Insulated</b> <b>joint</b> problems can be disruptive to railroad operations, and may in some cases {{increase the risk of}} train derailments.

The primary goal of this research is to identify measurable changes in the joint’s strain distribution that correlate with the extent of debonding, to serve as the basis of a non-destructive monitoring and evaluation technique.

40|$|Squats {{have become}} a major tricky problem in the track of many railways. In {{the quest for the}} root causes of squats, it is {{observed}} that they are occasionally found at locations of track stiffness changes such as at fish-plated insulated joints and at switches and crossings. Obviously, there should be other factors in the track, which, together with the stiffness change, have played important roles otherwise there will be squats at all such locations. A validated hybrid multibody-finite element model of vehicle–track vertical interaction is extended to simulate the frictional dynamic rolling contact at a fish-plated <b>insulated</b> <b>joint</b> in order to identify such factors. Elastic– plastic rail material property is taken into account. It is found that it is track short defect in the preload condition of the bolts and the contact between the fishplates and the rail head, which together with the stiffness change, causes large normal and longitudinal contact force variation at the fishplate end so that differential wear and differential plastic deformation may accumulate at a fixed location. With proper wavelength, the accumulated rail top geometry deviation may grow into a squat. The significance of the present work lies in that other track short defects such as damaged and improper railpads and fastening, and ballast voids may also have such effects, which may be responsible for {{a large portion of the}} many squats in the tracks.

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{have been}} carried out to assess the influence of key parameters on the deterioration of insulated joints. The measures of fatigue damage were adopted; one low-cycle fatigue based and one ratcheting based. Both of these models are based on the stress–strain evolution, which consequently needs to be accurately modelled. This calls for a constitutive model that can deal with plasticity under general multi- axial loading. In the current study the material parameters in the constitutive model have been calibrated to reflect the characteristics of the rail steel grade 900 A. The simulations verify previous findings that the insulating layer does not carry any significant load. Consequently severe strains occur at the rail head edge. The ratcheting based fatigue criterion was found to be the most suitable for the current study and the accumulated plastic strain after four load passages, εeff, was adopted to quantify the ratcheting. The numerical simulations showed that increasing the insulating gap from 4 mm to 6 mm gives roughly the same effect as an increase of the vertical load from 150 kN to 200 kN, which is an increase in εeff of about 10 %. In addition, a very detrimental effect of traction and braking was found: Increasing the longitudinal load from 0 kN up to 45 kN caused an increase in εeff magnitudes with up to 95 %. The predictions of plastic deformation and rolling contact fatigue have been performed. A fixed traction coefficient was presumed giving a wear pattern that is a linear function of pressure, which is in turn proportional to the cube-root of the applied normal force. The highest wear is predicted immediately after the <b>insulated</b> <b>joint,</b> with additional high-wear spots appearing a few metres later as the wheel bounces down and settles. In addition to numerical simulations four operational joints have been monitored in field to follow the degradation. It was found that material damage is induced very fast.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} some fatigue related {{problems}} in railway mechanics related to increased axle loads and speeds. The {{focus is on}} defects and discontinuities in the wheel [...] rail system that affect the risk of fatigue and fracture of railway components such as wheels, rails and insulated joints. Numerical simulations are performed to study plastic deformation and fatigue impact on an <b>insulated</b> <b>joint.</b> The simulations feature a sophisticated constitutive model able to model multi-axial ratchetting which is indicated as the main damage mechanism. Effects are quantified for increased vertical and longitudinal load magnitudes and insulating gap width. High longitudinal loading {{is found to be}} severely deteriorating for the rail material. The risk for rail breaks is investigated from mechanical and statistical points of view with focus on impacts of flatted wheels. The influence of wheel flat impacts on rail cracks is quantified from a dynamic load analysis that evaluates rail bending moments. Stress intensity factors for rail head cracks under bending and temperature loading are then evaluated. A stochastic relation is established between the crack and the wheel flat impact positions. Finally rail crack growth and fracture are predicted using standard methods. To evaluate the risk of subsurface cracking in a wheel, the Dang Van equivalent stress under Hertzian contacts is evaluated. Two methods for this evaluation are found to be useful when considering accuracy and efficiency. Subsurface initiated rolling contact fatigue cracks initiate in the vicinity of material defects. As these exist randomly in the material, fatigue will appear randomly under otherwise constant conditions. Further, corrugation of the rail adds to the randomness. A combination of statistical methods, contact mechanics and fatigue analysis is employed for the analysis. Statistical properties of the material defects, contact geometry and contact load or the output from a full train [...] track simulation are taken as input. For the failure analysis, the damage accumulation for random amplitude loading is evaluated.

40|$|In {{countries}} with rough weather conditions, frequent delays cause railway companies {{to waste time}} and money. Many of these delays {{are related to the}} train detection systems, as the old DC track circuits are still used in some countries, including Sweden, our case study. Since {{the most important factor in}} the railway system is safety, in some cases, the train detection system gets incorrect information and detects a non-existent train. The train slows down to avoid a problem in the track (with other trains or other faults), causing prolonged delays with cascading effects. The analysis in this licentiate contributes to the detection and reduction of TC failures; this, in turn, will save money for the railway community. A classification of the most probable causes of failures related to the train detection system was derived from the Swedish failures report database 0 FELIA. After classifying failures, we focussed on the three most common worst case scenarios: low resistance between the rails, external interference such as a lightning strike, and iron-powder-bridges in the <b>insulated</b> <b>joint.</b> Electromagnetic interferences (EMI) are a problem for the railway system in general. One source of electromagnetic (EM) transients is the return current harmonic produced by the engine of the rolling stock itself. In the first stage of this licentiate, we implemented a Matlab model of the power supply system of the Swedish railway infrastructure, using the characteristics and previous measures of a real source. A model of a train as an active load validated by the manufacturer was integrated as a subsystem in different positions of the infrastructure. This method was used to study the behaviour of the low frequency system from an electrical point of view but it could also be used as input for an electromagnetic model using high frequencies. The model was validated through measurements taken in northern Sweden. In addition, a 3 D model of the whole railway system was proposed. The simulation software was CST STUDIO SUITE® (Computer Simulation Technology Studio Suite), supported by real measurements on site and the lab to tune and validate the model. The results of the simulation show that the model fits with reality and is reliable for the study of track circuit sections.

40|$|Rail joints {{have been}} in {{existence}} {{for a long time}} of which their design has remained primarily unchanged over this period. Rail joints are a typical example of bolted joints. Like other bolted joints, their integrity depends on the quantitative representation of the contact pressure distribution at the interface during design. In service, rail joints are subjected to complex operating stresses, and they demand high maintenance cost because they are safety critical and have the lowest service life of the components on the rail tracks. In this study, non-intrusive ultrasonic techniques have been employed to investigate the parameter relevant to their design, operation and condition monitoring. The effect of variation in plate thickness and diameter of the bearing surface of the bolt head on the contact pressure distribution at bolted interfaces under varying axial loads was investigated. While it was observed that the contact pressure at the interface increases as the applied load increases, the distance {{from the edge of the}} bolt hole at which the distribution becomes stable is independent of the applied load on the bolted joint. However, the contact pressure distribution was observed to vary with the plate thickness. Although the variation in the peak value of average contact pressure distribution in bolted joints does not depend on the plate thickness, the distance from the edge of bolt hole at which the value of the distribution becomes stable increases as the plate thickness is increased. It was revealed that the peak value of the contact pressure distribution decreases as bearing diameter of the bolt head increases, and that the distance at which the normalised average contact pressure distributions become fairly constant also increases as the bearing diameter of the bolt head increases. In the majority of the cases, the distance falls between 3 and 4 of the bolt radius from the edge of the bolt hole. It was also observed that the edge of the bolt head has a pronounced effect on the position of the peak value of the contact pressure distribution at the interface. Furthermore, a model based on a Weibull distribution has been proposed to fit the experimental data, and a good correlation was observed. Non-intrusive experimental techniques were simultaneously used to investigate the relaxation of contact pressure and loosening of bolted joints subjected to cyclic shear loading. Three critical areas: the contact interface of bolted component, the bolt length and the rotation of the bolt head, were monitored during loosening of the joints. The results show that loosening of bolted joints can be grouped into four stages. The early stage of the loosening of bolted joints is characterised by cyclic strain ratcheting- loosening of the bolted joint during vibration without rotation of the bolt head. The higher the rate of relaxation at this early stage the lower is the resistance of the bolted joint to vibration induced loosening of bolted joints. Furthermore, the rate of loosening at the bolted joint interface is not the same but increases away from the bolt hole. While the rate of loosening of bolted joints largely depends on the amplitude and the number of cycles of the applied dynamic shear load, it is independent of the frequency of the applied load. In addition, increasing the bolt torque was found to increase the loosening resistance of the bolted joint. When joints are subjected to a constant shear load in addition to the dynamic shear load, the loosening rate increase, and this rate depend on the magnitude of this constant shear load. A normal incidence pulse-echo ultrasonic technique was used to monitor de-bonding at the interface of adhesive bonded insulated lap joints and insulated block joints, subjected to a shear load induced failure. The results revealed that the <b>insulated</b> <b>joint</b> exhibited elastic behaviour before a sudden failure (rupture) of the joint. The de-bonding of adhesive/insulating layer on the web sides of IBJs was found to occur earlier than at any other parts of the joint when the applied load was only a fraction of the peak of the shear load. However, the de-bonding at the top and foot of the rail occurred almost at the peak of the shear load. This same technique was used to monitor the degradation, and eventual failure of IBJs subjected to cyclic shear loading. The results showed that the degradation of the adhesive insulating layer has commenced, and was in progress when the joint was virtually intact and displayed elastic behaviours. The failure at the adhesive interface is indicated by a sudden change in the value of the measured reflection coefficient. After this, the failure of the joint is preceded by plastic behaviour of the joint. In addition, the change in the length of the bolts can also be monitored directly, as a complete failure at the interface of the bolted joints can be highlighted before the failure occurred. The results of this study have shown that, with further development, ultrasound can be used to monitor the condition of IBJs while in service...|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{were carried}} out to evaluate the performance of <b>insulating</b> <b>joints</b> in railway tracks. Although <b>insulating</b> <b>joints</b> are considered weak spots on the track due to the imposed rail discontinuity, they are nevertheless essential to monitor and control train traffic. All simulations presented were conducted using the commercial FE code Abaqus. Results were extracted, processed and plotted {{with the help of}} the programming languages Python and Matlab. No dynamic effects were included in the simulations. This study consists of three major parts: The first part was to compare hyper-elastic Neo-hookean and linear elastic material models for the insulating layer in the joint. The simulations showed that there was no significant difference in stresses or displacements between the two models. Investigating the effects of increasing the stiffness of the insulating material was performed in the second part. The investigation showed that increased stiffness decreases the plastic deformation in the steel. However when increasing the stiffness the interfacial shear stress increases. This will promote failure of the glue that ties insulation and rail together. The effect of having an inclined <b>insulating</b> <b>joint</b> was analyzed. Four different inclination angles θ, were tested ranging from 0 ◦ (no inclination) to 60 ◦. By increasing the angle the plastic deformation in the steel on both sides of the insulating layer increased under pure rolling conditions. Inclination did not seem to cause any significant changes in interfacial shear stresses. Finally a comparison was made of the vertical displacement of the wheel cen- ter between the quasi-static ABAQUS simulations and approximations derived from Newtonian physics. These approximations indicate that the time that it takes for the wheel to travel over the gap is not sufficient to allow for the wheel displacements predicted by the quasi-static simulations when traveling on a speed exceeding roughly 85 km/h...|$|R

The study is largely motivated by plans to increase allowed axle loads in Sweden. The aim is to deliver operational results, as well as exemplify how practical problems in railway mechanics can be assessed by computer based simulations. In the first appended paper the influence of wheel flat impacts on the growth of rail cracks and subsequent rail breaks is analyzed. This calls for an analysis of the dynamic train [...] track interaction combined with a fracture mechanics analysis of crack growth and fracture. To account for high frequency excitations due to wheel flat impacts the in-house code DIFF is employed for the analysis of train [...] track interaction. Stress intensity factors for rail cracks are derived using FE-simulations. Added loading due to restricted thermal contraction of all-welded rails is included. Risks of rail breaks for specified crack sizes and temperatures are evaluated as functions of impact load magnitudes. In addition crack growth rates are quantified. Simulation results indicate that wheel flats increase the risk of rail breaks, but have a limited influence on rack growth rates. The latter is due to the infrequent occurrence of wheel flats and the fact that these need to impact in a rather narrow region to cause any considerable influence on the crack growth rate. In the second paper deterioration of <b>insulated</b> <b>joints</b> is analyzed by 3 D FE-simulations. Repeated negotiations of a loaded wheel over an <b>insulating</b> <b>joint</b> is simulated.

40|$|Abstract: Adhesively bonded <b>insulated</b> rail <b>joints</b> {{are used}} to {{electrically}} isolate sections of track into discrete blocks to detect the positions of trains, and are sometimes useful in detecting rail breaks. Recent advances in high-strength rails allow {{for the use of}} higher-weight cars. With this increased axle loading of the freight lines, bonded rail joints are encountering early breakdown through either electrical or mechanical failure. Service lives as short as 12 – 18 months have been reported on some rail lines, significantly lower than the lifetime of other railway components. The cost of replacing the joints has significantly increased the desire for a joint with improved durability. Commercially available bonded rail joints are typically double butt-strap joints consisting of two steel reinforcing joint bars, bonded to the rails with an epoxy adhesive that may contain a fibreglass or aramid cloth layer. This paper investigates a tapered bonded joint that was proposed to reduce the high stresses that can result in the more typical butt-strap joint configuration. The first type of analysis models the rails and joint bars as beams, and the adhesive and ground as distributed elastic springs.
