5|$|The series <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> {{an unfortunate}} start by {{reproducing}} a photograph on page {{two of the}} editorial that purported to be of Eddy, but was in fact of someone else.|$|E
5|$|Grabner <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a {{hot start}} with the Rangers, scoring his first hat-trick as a Ranger against the Tampa Bay Lightning on October 30. He {{finished}} the season second on the team in goals with 27, his highest single-season total since his rookie season in 2010-11.|$|E
5|$|The Giants' record rebounded to 9–7 in 1984, and Taylor had {{his fourth}} All-Pro season. He <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a quick start, {{recording}} four sacks in a September game. In the playoffs the Giants defeated the Los Angeles Rams 16–13, but lost 21–10 to the eventual champion 49ers.|$|E

5000|$|Rivera <b>got</b> 2010 <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a slow start, batting just [...]235 {{over the}} first two months of the season. He {{finished}} the season hitting [...]243 with 15 home runs.|$|R
50|$|That defeat, {{along with}} the size of the {{transfer}} fee, <b>got</b> Peach <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a terrible start with the fans - and he was never a popular player throughout his whole Town career.|$|R
5|$|Aerial {{operations}} for the incursion <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a slow start. Reconnaissance flights over the operational area were restricted since MACV believed that they might serve as a signal of intention. The role of the Air Force in the planning for the incursion itself was minimal at best, in part to preserve the secrecy of Menu which was then considered an overture to the thrust across the border.|$|E
5|$|In the {{shortened}} 2011–12 NBA season, the Blazers <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a 7–2 start. But {{the team}} quickly began to collapse, as starting point guard Raymond Felton, among others, struggled with McMillan's {{new approach to}} a running-style offense. The team gained some notability as Aldridge was named to his first All-Star Game. Despite Aldridge's performance, {{the rest of the}} team became more inconsistent.|$|E
5|$|Speedie resurfaced in 1960, when he {{was named}} the end coach for the new American Football League's Houston Oilers under former {{teammate}} and Oilers head coach Lou Rymkus. The Oilers won the AFL championship in 1960, but Rymkus was fired after the team <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a slow start the following year. Team owner Bud Adams urged Speedie {{to stay on the}} staff, but Speedie resigned out of loyalty to Rymkus.|$|E
25|$|Hampshire Hawks endured {{their second}} no-result {{in two days}} against Essex Eagles, having batted to a {{competitive}} total of 151 for 9 in their 20 overs, with Greg Lamb making 67. However, the Essex innings never <b>got</b> <b>off,</b> due <b>to</b> rain.|$|R

25|$|At {{the same}} time, Scotland's Home Championship win <b>got</b> Scotland <b>off</b> <b>to</b> {{a good start}} in their first attempt {{to qualify for the}} European Championships, with this and the {{following}} season's tourney doubling as qualifying matches for the 1968 finals.|$|R
5|$|Super Bowl XXV {{took place}} amidst a {{background}} of war and patriotism. The Persian Gulf War had begun {{less than two weeks}} previous, and the nation rallied around the Super Bowl as a symbol of America. The Giants <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a quick 3–0 lead; however, the Bills scored the next 12 points. The Giants responded by running a nearly eight-minute drive, which culminated in a 14-yard touchdown pass from Hostetler to Stephen Baker.|$|E
5|$|The Giants {{won their}} first 10 {{games of the}} 1990 season, setting a record for the best start in the team's history. The San Francisco 49ers also <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a strong start, {{matching}} New York with their own 10–0 start. Although both teams lost their next game, their Week 13 matchup was still eagerly anticipated. The Giants held the 49ers' vaunted offense to seven points, but scored just three themselves.|$|E
5|$|The captive {{breeding}} program, {{led by the}} San Diego Wild Animal Park and Los Angeles Zoo, {{and with}} other participating zoos around the country, including the Oklahoma City Zoo and Botanical Garden, <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a slow start due to the condor's mating habits. However, utilizing the bird's ability to double clutch, biologists began removing the first egg from the nest and raising it with puppets, allowing the parents to lay another egg.|$|E
50|$|In the 2000s, Exact {{acquired}} US manufacturing ERP software providers Macola, JobBOSS and MAX. In 2007, Exact purchased Longview Solutions for US $51.5 million. Longview Solutions <b>got</b> sold <b>off</b> <b>to</b> Marlin Equity Partners in July 2014 for {{an undisclosed}} amount of money.|$|R
5000|$|By {{the middle}} of May, Priddy was batting only [...]204, and McCarthy benched him, putting Gordon back at second base. Rizzuto {{recalled}} that Priddy's disrespect of Gordon <b>got</b> him <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a rocky start with the Yankee veterans. As a result, Priddy got no sympathy when he {{failed to live up}} to expectations and his own cocky predictions.|$|R
5000|$|An enraged Wellington later wrote, They {{had about}} 13,000 to watch 1,400. There {{they were all}} {{sleeping}} in their spurs even; but the French <b>got</b> <b>off.</b> I begin <b>to</b> be {{of the opinion that}} there is nothing on earth so stupid as a gallant officer.|$|R
5|$|The first {{televised}} {{match was}} Razor Ramon versus Ted DiBiase. DiBiase <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a quick start by attacking Ramon before the match began. Ramon quickly turned the match around with several clotheslines. DiBiase regained control before untying a turnbuckle cover. Ramon won the match after ramming DiBiase's {{head into the}} exposed turnbuckle and using the Razor's Edge to get the pin.|$|E
5|$|With a new first-time head coach, {{the team}} <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> slow starts. It started {{the season with}} a 1–5 record, but won 18 of its final 24 games and started its conference {{schedule}} with a 2–3 record, but won 8 of its final 9 games. The recovery enabled the team to qualify for its 32nd post season appearance (24 NCAA, 5 NIT and 2 CBI).|$|E
5|$|After {{the triumph}} of the {{previous}} season, the 1945–46 season was a complete loss for Kennedy. He <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a slow start, beginning the season at right wing before being returned to his center position and he also fell ill. By January Kennedy had only 5 points in 21 games and was then lost {{for the rest of the}} season due to an injury to his foot, when a Boston Bruin player's skate dug into his boot. With the Leafs also losing Captain Syl Apps to injury Toronto missed the playoffs.|$|E
25|$|The Heat won against London Capital on 10 January, {{meaning that}} they had <b>got</b> 2010 <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a good start with a three-game winning streak. However, they won just twice more in 18 games as they {{plummeted}} down the table to finish a lowly 11th, {{the first time in}} club history that they had failed to qualify for the play-offs.|$|R
60|$|Harry Esmond <b>got</b> <b>off</b> {{the horse}} <b>to</b> run to his mistress, as did little Frank, {{and one of}} the grooms took charge of the two beasts, while the other, hat and periwig in hand, walked by my lord's bridle to the front gate, which lay half a mile away.|$|R
50|$|Goodison Park was {{the venue}} for England's home clash against Ireland, who were newly renamed Northern Ireland in FIFA's eyes. Harold Hassall <b>got</b> England <b>off</b> <b>to</b> {{a good start}} with a goal after just ten minutes. Eddie McMorran put the Irish back on terms just before the hour mark, but Hassall {{completed}} his brace six minutes later. Lofthouse completed a comfortable 3-1 win for England.|$|R
5|$|Asashōryū <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a bad {{start in}} the July tournament by losing to Toyonoshima on the first day. After a second loss to maegashira Tochinonada on day five, he {{pulled out of the}} tournament on the sixth day citing pain in his elbow. The September tournament {{unfolded}} in a similarly poor fashion. After compiling a lacklustre 5–4 record through the first nine days, Asashōryū forfeited his tenth-day match to maegashira Gōeidō and withdrew. He had elbow pain, and presented a medical certificate.|$|E
5|$|Bayern <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a {{good start}} under Ancelotti, {{defeating}} Dortmund 2–0 in the 2016 DFL-Supercup. Despite being eliminated in the quarter-finals of the Champions League by Real Madrid and the semi-finals of the DFB-Pokal by Borussia Dortmund, they managed to clinch a fifth consecutive Bundesliga title with three matches remaining following a 6–0 away win over VfL Wolfsburg. Ancelotti was sacked by Bayern on 28 September 2017 and replaced by interim manager Willy Sagnol, following a 3–0 loss to PSG in the 2017–18 Champions League group stage and a slow start to the Bundesliga season that found them in third place.|$|E
5|$|Because California {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Virginia Tech's Mike Imoh fielded the ball at the goal line and returned it 40yards. Bryan Randall <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a good start, completing two passes for 26yards, and Kevin Jones ran the ball another 16yards. After pushing inside the California red zone, however, the California defense stiffened and Tech was prevented from gaining another first down. Kicker Carter Warley attempted his third field goal of the game—this one a 28-yard kick—but as before, the kick was no good.|$|E
50|$|Higgs {{was picked}} on the 1979 tour of India, along with Yardley and Peter Sleep. Five wickets against South Zone <b>got</b> his tour <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a strong start. Higgs took 7-143 {{in the first}} test (a draw).|$|R
25|$|Cadet {{inspection}} was a {{major event}} in the early 1960s. Everyone male and female, unless he/she had a religious exemption or was in Grade 13, was required to participate. The guys wore wool uniforms and the girls wore blazers. The cadets marched down Snyder Avenue, along Church Street, and back up Arthur Street before inspection. Participants <b>got</b> <b>off</b> classes <b>to</b> practice and after inspection, the evening ended up being quite a big event with a dance at the end.|$|R
60|$|It {{was about}} one {{o'clock in the}} {{afternoon}} when we seemed to be quite close to the green flanks of Umpondwana, that of a sudden we cut a wide spoor trampled by thousands of naked feet. Jan and Gaasha <b>got</b> <b>off</b> the waggon <b>to</b> examine it, but Ralph did not move.|$|R
5|$|Benzema <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a {{good start}} for the 2008–09 season, scoring twice in Lyon's opening league match against Toulouse. The {{following}} three weeks, he scored goals against Rhône-Alpes rivals Grenoble and Saint-Étienne and scored a goal against Nice, converting a penalty in the dying seconds. Lyon won all three matches. As {{a result of his}} early goals, Lyon club president Jean-Michel Aulas quelled the many transfer rumors surrounding Benzema by placing a €100million price tag on the striker. He was also nominated alongside Franck Ribéry to be featured on the French cover of the video game FIFA 09.|$|E
5|$|In 1120, the English {{political}} landscape changed dramatically. Three hundred passengers embarked on the White Ship {{to travel from}} Barfleur in Normandy to England, including {{the heir to the}} throne, William Adelin, and many other senior nobles. Stephen had intended to sail on the same ship but changed his mind at the last moment and <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> await another vessel, either out of concern for overcrowding on board the ship, or because he was suffering from diarrhoea. The ship foundered en route, and all but two of the passengers died, including William Adelin.|$|E
5|$|In 1927–28 Australian season, Woodfull {{played in}} five matches and was highly {{productive}} {{in the last}} three. He scored 99 and 191 not out in a victory over New South Wales, before adding 106 in an innings triumph over South Australia. He rounded off the season with 94 and 81 not out in a draw in the return match against New South Wales. He ended the Australian campaign with 645 runs at 129.00. With Ponsford amassing 1217 runs at 152.12, Victoria usually <b>got</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a strong start with the bat, and won the Shield easily.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Gordon {{turned up}} {{half an hour}} ago," [...] Acton said. [...] "It appears {{that he was going}} into the city, and <b>got</b> <b>off</b> the cars <b>to</b> talk over things with you. I believe he had a notion of going on again to-night, but Mrs. Acton won't hear of it." ...|$|R
2500|$|Akhil Herwadkar then <b>got</b> Mumbai <b>off</b> <b>to</b> a {{good start}} with a {{whirlwind}} 86-ball 107 {{but the rest of}} the lineup fumbled after his departure with the score on 141 in 22.2 overs. While Siddhesh Lad toiled to keep the innings afloat, the TN bowlers struck at the other end to push Mumbai further on the back-foot. He was the last to return to the pavilion for 47.|$|R
50|$|Historically, the Mezen Bay was {{the fishing}} area. The pomors who {{populated}} the coast were fishing along the coast. A sudden {{change of the}} weather could drive them off-shore. In this case, Morzhovets island was the last land before they <b>got</b> driven <b>off</b> <b>to</b> the Barents Sea and perish, and thus {{was considered to be}} the last resort. Another traditional occupation of the pomors in the Mezen Bay was seal hunting.|$|R
