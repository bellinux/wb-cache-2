5|$|Another {{spin-off}} starring Rainn Wilson as Dwight Schrute {{running a}} bed-and-breakfast and beet farm, titled The Farm, was proposed in early 2012. In October 2012, however, NBC {{decided not to}} <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> the series.

In January 2017 Gaiman confirmed the miniseries will be available on Amazon Prime in 2018 and will be broadcast on the BBC after its Amazon release.|$|E

However, the rabbi realizes that Shira is acting to please her family and refuses to condone the marriage.|$|E
5|$|Data-driven, Romney often {{played the}} role of a devil's {{advocate}} during exhaustive analysis of whether to <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> a deal. He wanted to drop a Bain Capital hedge fund that initially lost money, but other partners disagreed with him and it eventually made billions. He opted out of the Artisan Entertainment deal, not wanting to profit from a studio that produced R-rated films. Romney served {{on the board of directors}} of Damon Corporation, a medical testing company later found guilty of defrauding the government; Bain Capital tripled its investment before selling off the company, and the fraud was discovered by the new owners (Romney was never implicated). In some cases, Romney had little involvement with a company once Bain Capital acquired it.|$|E
5|$|McKay {{stated that}} he {{believed}} Kimball could still serve as an apostle even if he underwent a complete laryngectomy and advised him to <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> the procedure. Martin subsequently surgically removed one of Kimball's vocal cords {{and half of the}} other, leaving him barely able to speak above a hoarse whisper. After several weeks of enforced silence, Kimball slowly recovered, and by November 1957, he was allowed by his physician to resume speaking in public. Kimball's voice remained raspy throughout the rest of his life, and he usually wore an ear-mounted microphone to help magnify his voice, even when he was speaking at normal microphone-equipped pulpits.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the ensuing}} decades, the Erie Railroad fell into debt {{along with its}} competitor, the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad. On September 16, 1960, the Interstate Commerce Commission {{approved}} the railroads to <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> a merger, creating the new Erie-Lackawanna Railroad on October 15, 1960. The new railroad lasted only 16 years. In 1976, the Erie Lackawanna and several other large railroad companies were merged into the newly formed federal Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail). At this point, stations had to fight for survival. The station depot at Harriman has been closed and boarded up since at least 1970. Passenger train service, however, remained intact through the early 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The 1987 {{season was}} a {{disappointment}} for the Giants. They lost their first two {{games of the season}} before the 1987 NFL Players Strike. As opposed to the players strike five years previous, NFL owners made a decision to <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> replacement players. Unlike other teams such as the Washington Redskins and Houston Oilers, who made specific and elaborate plans to deal with the replacement games, the Giants made no plans. This resulted in the Giants losing all three replacement games, putting their record at 0–5 before the strike was over and the regular players returned. Though the Giants went a respectable 6–4 over their final 10 games, they were out of the playoffs at 6–9. A particular disappointment was the running game, which due to injuries to the offensive line (including tackle Karl Nelson missing the entire season due to Hodgkin's disease) struggled all season. Standouts included tight end Mark Bavaro, who led the team in catches with 55, and three of the Giants linebackers making the Pro Bowl—Taylor, Carl Banks (who was voted the team's MVP by the players), and Carson.|$|E

As an initiator of the New Wave movement, she edited the 1968 anthology England Swings SF, whose stories she collected while living in England for a year.|$|E
25|$|In December 2011, the Government {{announced}} that it intended to <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> trial badger culls in two 150km2 areas. These would take place over a 6-week period {{with the aim of}} reducing the badger population by 70% in each area. Farmers and land-owners would be licensed to control badgers by shooting and would bear the costs of any culls. The Government was to bear the costs of licensing and monitoring the culls.|$|E
25|$|A major bureaucratic fight {{erupted in}} the US {{government}} over the project. One argument against collaboration was that the Soviets would use it to steal US technology and know-how. A second was symbolic — the Soviet physicist Andrei Sakharov was in internal exile and the US was pushing the Soviet Union on its human rights record. The United States National Security Council convened a meeting {{under the direction of}} William Flynn Martin that resulted in a consensus that the US should <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> the project.|$|E

25|$|Some {{economists have}} criticized the {{efficiency}} of democracy, citing {{the premise of the}} irrational voter, or a voter who makes decisions without all of the facts or necessary information {{in order to make a}} truly informed decision. Another argument is that democracy slows down processes because of the amount of input and participation needed in order to <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> a decision. A common example often quoted to substantiate this point is the high economic development achieved by China (a non-democratic country) as compared to India (a democratic country). According to economists, the lack of democratic participation in countries like China allows for unfettered economic growth.|$|E
25|$|The {{resignation}} did not {{quell the}} consequences of Cowen’s actions, however. Eamon Gilmore {{announced that he would}} <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> his motion of no confidence on Wednesday, 26 January. Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny also announced that if Cowen did not ask President Mary McAleese for an immediate dissolution of the Dáil Éireann, his own party would put forward a motion of no confidence in the Taoiseach on Tuesday, ahead of Labour's motion. Then, on Sunday the 23rd, John Gormley announced that the Green Party was withdrawing from the government coalition, leaving Cowen {{at the head of a}} minority government (with seven ministers, the absolute minimum mandated by the constitution) and facing two consecutive no-confidence votes in the Dáil.|$|E
25|$|Come late October, {{and with}} the season rapidly approaching, DIG chose not to <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> the offer to buy the team. Differences between Wojcicki and the others about control over {{operations}} of the team {{were part of the}} problem. DIG at one time even offered to buy the team outright from Wojcicki, but an agreed upon price could not be achieved. This {{due in large part to}} the group being unable to verify the finances of the club. The newly appointed commissioner of the league flew to Edmonton and met with Best in a last-ditch attempt to have the group move forward with the purchase however no positive resolution could be made.Thus, Wojcicki would go into the season financing the club alone.|$|E

25|$|Given the {{limitations}} of the 3ª CCE to deal with the uprising in such a large region, the Command of the 3rd Military Region in Luanda decided to organize an operation with a stronger military force to subjugate it. A provisional battalion under the command of Major Rebocho Vaz was organized by the Luanda Infantry Regiment, integrating the 3ª CCE, the 4ª CCE (stationed in Luanda) and the 5ª CCE (that was still in route from the Metropole to Angola). On 4 February, the 4ª CCE was already embarked in the train ready to be dispatched to Malanje, when an uprising at Luanda erupted, with several prisons and Police facilities being stormed. Despite the indefinite situation at Luanda and despite having few combat units available there, General Libório, commander of the 3ª Military Region decided to <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> the sending of the 4ª CCE to Malanje, which arrived there on 5 February. The provisional battalion started gradually the operations to subdue the uprising.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, general Kutrzeba and {{his staff}} {{officers}} had suspected, even before the German invasion, {{that it would be}} the neighbouring Armies that would bear the German attack, and had developed plans at an offensive towards the south, to relieve Army Łódź. In {{the first week of the}} campaign, those plans, however, were rejected by the Polish commander-in-chief, Marshal Edward Rydz-Śmigły. By 8 September Kutrzeba had lost contact with Rydz-Śmigły, who had relocated his command center from Warsaw to Brest; due to these factors, Kutrzeba decided to <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> his plan. His situation was dire, as German forces were close to surrounding his units: the German 8th Army had secured the southern bank of the Bzura river, and the German 4th Army had secured the northern bank of Vistula, from Włocławek to Wyszogród, and its elements were attacking the rear of the Armies Pomorze and Poznań from the direction of Inowrocław and crossing the Vistula river near Płock.|$|E
25|$|When initial {{assessments}} {{were being}} made for the feasibility of restoring the observatory, both the telescope and observatory were in a poor condition {{as a result of}} years of neglect and an arson attempt by some local children. The telescope is made predominantly from brass and thus suffered minimal corrosion and damage. Most importantly the lens of the telescope survived unscathed allowing for restoration. This was carried out at first by several dedicated parents and governors of the school, amongst them Syd Little. Soon after the basic restoration ideas were raised for a larger project allowing the teaching of astronomy on a larger scale. After getting clearance from the original owners of the telescope {{to go ahead with the}} project, Rossall was given funds from the Lawrence House Trust, an educational charity, to <b>go</b> <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> their plans. The centre had an official opening on 26 September 2006 with Old Rossallian and former Astronomer Royal Sir Francis Graham Smith in attendance. The centre's motto is 'Astronomy For All' meaning that it offers courses to Rossall Students but also at a small cost to the general public. Courses also range from beginner to advanced to ensure that anybody who wishes to study Astronomy can do so.|$|E
