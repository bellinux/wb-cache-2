40|$|Purpose: This study {{explored}} {{the impact of}} non-sink receptor conditions on the in vitro skin permeation test (IVPT) and sought to estimate equivalent sink condition IVPT data. Methods: Simulated diffusion model and experimental IVPT data were generated for <b>ethyl</b> <b>salicylate</b> across human epidermal membranes in Franz diffusion cells using six different receptor phases, with a 10 fold variation in <b>ethyl</b> <b>salicylate</b> solubility. Results: Both simulated and experimental IVPT – time profiles were markedly affected by receptor phase solubility and receptor sampling rates. Similar sink condition equivalent estimated maximum fluxes were obtained by nonlinear regression and adjustment of linear regression estimates of steady state flux for relative saturation of the receptor phase over time for the four receptor phases in which the <b>ethyl</b> <b>salicylate</b> was relatively soluble. The markedly lower steady - state fluxes found for the other two phases in which <b>ethyl</b> <b>salicylate</b> was less soluble was attributed to an aqueous solution boundary layer effect. Conclusions: Non-sink receptor phase IVPT data {{can be used to}} derive equivalent sink receptor phase IVPT data provided the receptor phase solubility and hydrodynamics are sufficient to minimise the impact of aqueous diffusion layers on IVPT data.

40|$|We {{sought to}} {{understand}} {{when and how}} hydration enhances the percutaneous absorption of salicylate esters. Human epidermal membrane fluxes and stratum corneum solubilities of neat and diluted solutions of three esters were determined under hydrated and dehydrated conditions. Hydration doubled the human epidermal flux seen for methyl and <b>ethyl</b> <b>salicylate</b> under dehydrated conditions and increased the flux of neat glycol salicylate 10 -fold. Mechanistic analyses showed that this hydration-induced enhancement arises mainly from {{an increase in the}} stratum corneum diffusivity of the three esters. Further, we showed that unlike methyl and <b>ethyl</b> <b>salicylate,</b> glycol salicylate is hygroscopic and the ∼ 10 -fold hydration-induced flux enhancement seen with neat glycol salicylate may be due to its ability to hydrate the stratum corneum to a greater extent. The hydration-induced enhancements in in vitro epidermal flux seen here for glycol and <b>ethyl</b> <b>salicylate</b> were similar to those reported for their percutaneous absorption rates in a comparable in vivo study, whilst somewhat higher enhancement was seen for methyl salicylate in vivo. This may be explained by a physiologically induced self enhancement of neat methyl salicylate absorption in vivo which is not applicable in vitro...|$|E

The complexes are hydrolysed by hydrothermally assisted sol-gel technique and gave hydrolyzed product. Thermal studies of these products are made which favor the formation of multicomponent oxides.

40|$|Proximate factors {{affecting}} animal behavior include stimuli generated by conspecifics. In spider mites {{of the genus}} Tetranychus (Acari: Tetranychidae), males guard pre-reproductive quiescent females, because only the first mating results in fertilization. In a dual-choice experiment, more adult males of T. urticae were attracted to females guarded by a male than to solitary females. Because spider mites are known to perceive volatiles, we hypothesized that guarded and solitary females differ in the volatile blends emitted. To test this hypothesis, headspace volatiles of guarded females, solitary females, and solitary males were collected, respectively. GC/MS analysis detected octanal, methyl <b>salicylate,</b> <b>ethyl</b> 4 -ethoxybenzoate, and methyl cis-dihydrojasmonate {{in all of the}} groups. Orthogonal Projection to Latent Structures Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) of the blends clearly discriminated guarded females from solitary females, supporting our hypothesis. Individual compounds did not show significant difference in emission rates for guarded females vs. solitary females, suggesting that differences lay in the total blend composition. OPLS-DA did not discriminate between the blends emitted by guarded females and solitary males. In conclusion, the differences in the volatile blends are likely to mediate male discrimination between guarded and solitary females...|$|R

We examined qualitative and quantitative changes in selected intracellular and secreted cytokines in human keratinocyte cultures in {{response to}} non-sensitizing contact irritants (croton oil, sodium lauryl sulfate, methyl <b>salicylate,</b> <b>ethyl</b> phenylpropiolate), sensitizing irritants (oxazolone, dinitrofluorobenzene), and ulcerative agents (phenol, benzalkonium chloride, chromium trioxide). The chemicals were also applied to mouse skin to assess whether the chemical-specific pattern of inflammation correlated with the in vitro production of keratinocyte-derived cytokines. Although all agents elicited neutrophils to the site of chemical application, time dependent and chemical-specific patterns of inflammation could be detected. Sodium lauryl sulfate, phenol, and croton oil induced increases in IL- 8 production at non-cytotoxic concentrations in semi-confluent human keratinocyte cultures. Phenol and croton oil stimulated tumor necrosis factor α production, whereas croton oil was the only agent found to induce granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor production. Croton oil, phenol, benzalkonium chloride, and dinitrofluorobenzene induced the intracellular production of IL- 1 α without a concomitant release into the medium. The release of cytokines occurred in parallel with a relative increase in cytokine-specific mRNA transcripts. Studies using neutralizing antibodies to tumor necrosis factor α and IL- 1 α demonstrated that IL- 8 induction by croton oil and phenol occured directly rather than through autocrine circuits. These data suggest that a given pattern of cytokine production is chemical-specific and may predict the contribution of keratinocytes to skin inflammation...|$|R
40|$|A 5 -kbp region {{upstream}} of the are-ben-cat genes was cloned from Acinetobacter sp. strain ADP 1, {{extending the}} supraoperonic cluster of catabolic genes to 30 kbp. Four open reading frames, salA, salR, salE, and salD, were identified from the nucleotide sequence. Reverse transcription-PCR studies suggested that these open reading frames are organized into two convergent transcription units, salAR and salDE. The salE gene, encoding a protein of 239 residues, was ligated into expression vector pET 5 a. Its product, SalE, {{was shown to}} have esterase activity against short-chain alkyl esters of 4 -nitrophenol but was also able to hydrolyze <b>ethyl</b> <b>salicylate</b> to ethanol and salicylic acid. A mutant of ADP 1 with a Kmr cassette introduced into salE had {{lost the ability to}} utilize only ethyl and methyl salicylates of the esters tested as sole carbon sources, and no esterase activity against <b>ethyl</b> <b>salicylate</b> could be detected in cell extracts. SalE was induced during growth on <b>ethyl</b> <b>salicylate</b> but not during growth on salicylate itself. salD encoded a protein of undetermined function with homologies to the Escherichia coli FadL membrane protein, which is involved in facilitating fatty acid transport, {{and a number of other}} proteins detected during aromatic catabolism, which may also function in hydrocarbon transport or uptake processes. A Kmr cassette insertion in salD deleteriously affected cell growth and viability. The salA and salR gene products closely resemble two Pseudomonas proteins, NahG and NahR, respectively encoding salicylate hydroxylase and the LysR family regulator of both salicylate and naphthalene catabolism. salA was cloned into pUC 18 together with salR and salE, and its gene product showed salicylate-inducible hydroxylase activity against a range of substituted salicylates, with the same relative specific activities as found in wild-type ADP 1 grown on salicylate. Mutations involving insertion of Kmr cassettes into salA and salR eliminated expression of salicylate hydroxylase activity and the ability to grow on either salicylate or <b>ethyl</b> <b>salicylate.</b> Studies of mutants with disruptions of genes of the β-ketoadipate pathway with or without an additional salE mutation confirmed that <b>ethyl</b> <b>salicylate</b> and salicylate were channeled into the β-ketoadipate pathway at the level of catechol and thence dissimilated by the cat gene products.

For each separate compound or simple mixtures, quantitative analysis methods are reported. However, for a mixture containing all above mentioned active compounds, no assay methods were found. Due to the differing physicochemical characteristics, two methods were developed and optimized simultaneously. The non-volatile capsaicinoids, salicylic acid and glycol monosalicylate were analyzed with liquid chromatography following liquid-liquid extraction, whereas the volatile compounds were analyzed with static headspace-gas chromatography. For the latter method, liquid paraffin was selected as compatible dilution solvent. The optimized methods were validated in terms of specificity, linearity, accuracy and precision {{in a range of}} 80 % to 120 % of the expected concentrations.

40|$|The {{leafhopper}} Mgenia fuscovaria Stål (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) is a vector of aster yellows phytoplasma (AY), 'Candidatus Phytoplasma asteris', in grapevine, Vitis vinifera L. (Vitaceae), in South Africa. In {{a previous}} study, M. fuscovaria was preferentially attracted to AY-infected compared to uninfected grapevine branches, although {{the mode of}} attraction was not determined. Phytoplasma infection may alter the volatile profiles of plants, rendering them more attractive to the insect vector. This may {{lead to an increase}} in the number of vectors transmitting the pathogen. The volatile compounds that attract or repel insect pests could be used in behavioural manipulation strategies to manage pests. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of AY-infection on the volatile composition of the grapevine cultivars Colombard and Chenin blanc in summer and autumn, and the associated behavioural and electrophysiological responses of M. fuscovaria towards these changes in volatile profiles. Volatile analyses of AY-infected and uninfected grapevine branches revealed both qualitative and quantitative differences. In summer, methyl salicylate was produced in significantly higher amounts or only produced in AY-infected branches in cv. Chenin blanc and cv. Colombard, respectively. Similarly, <b>ethyl</b> <b>salicylate</b> was recorded only from AY-infected branches of both cultivars during summer. There was a significant increase in the total volatile emissions in AY-infected compared to uninfected grapevine cv. Colombard, including several green leaf volatiles. The compounds that differed significantly between AY-infected and uninfected branches in autumn were produced exclusively or in greater quantities in uninfected branches. (E,E) -α-farnesene was the most abundant compound recorded in all cases. Grapevine branches infected with AY often had a greater mass than uninfected branches with the same leaf area. In behavioural studies, M. fuscovaria displayed no consistent preferences toward volatiles from AY-infected and uninfected grapevine branches cv. Colombard or cv. Chenin blanc in summer or autumn. In summer, there were no significant differences in the choices made by leafhoppers for both cultivars. In autumn, leafhoppers preferred purified air over AY-infected cv. Colombard branches and AY-infected cv. Chenin blanc branches over purified air. There was no difference in the choices made between male and female leafhoppers. In electrophysiological tests, M. fuscovaria antennae displayed weak responses to grapevine volatiles collected in summer. Consistent responses were identified to 1 -octen- 3 -ol, phenol, (E,E) -α-farnesene, which is produced at elevated concentrations by AY-infected grapevine, and aromadendrene, which was only produced by AY-infected branches and not by uninfected branches cv. Colombard. For grapevine cv. Chenin blanc, insects responded to the co-eluting green leaf volatiles (E) - 2 -hexenal, (Z) - 3 -hexen- 1 -ol, (E) - 2 -hexen- 1 -ol and 1 -hexanol as well as nonane from uninfected branches. The results from this study suggest that M. fuscovaria is not preferentially attracted toward AY-infected grapevine branches based solely on olfactory cues. Based on the weak responses observed in electrophysiological and behavioural tests, as well as results obtained in studies on other leafhopper species, the observed attraction could be a result of visual cues rather than olfactory cues or a combination of both.

Simple phenolic glucoside {{is rare in}} Sapindaceae, {{and it may be}} of chemotaxonomic significance for Eurycorymbus as an independent genus within the family Sapindaceae. Besides the novel compounds 3, 7, and 28, compounds 1, 2, 4 - 6, 8 - 10, 12 - 16, and 18 - 27 were isolated from E. cavaleriei for the first time. In the present study, twenty eight compounds were isolated from the stems of E. cavaleriei. Twenty seven compounds had been identified including the new structures eurycorymboside A (3), eurycorymboside B (7), and eurycorymbic acid (28). The twenty four known compounds are vanillic acid 4 -O-beta-D-glucoside (1), glucosyringic acid (2), koaburaside (4), fraxin (5), tachioside (6), (-) -lyoniresinol 3 a-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (8), (-) -isolariciresinol 3 a-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (9), kaempferol 3 -O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1 → 4) -alpha-L-rhamnopyranosy 1 - 7 - O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside (10), 5 '-demethyl aquillochin (11), kaempferitrin (12), scopoletin (13), (-) -syringaresinol (14), cleomiscosin A (15), cleomiscosin B (16), daucosterol (18), methyl salicylate (19), <b>ethyl</b> <b>salicylate</b> (20), 4 -hydroxy- 3, 5 -bis(3 -methyl- 2 -butenyl) benzaldehyde (21), 1 -octatriacontanol (22), stigmasterol (23), beta-sitosterol (24), acetyloleanolic acid (25), vanillin (26), and 3 -oxotirucalla- 7, 24 -dien- 21 -oic acid (27). Compound 17 was tentatively determined to be either cleomiscosin C or D. Sapindaceae is a family of flowering plants with 145 genera and 1490 species, distributed mainly in tropical regions, with a few genera growing in the temperate zone. Eurycorymbus cavaleriei (Levl.) Rehd. et Hand. -Mazz. is the only species of the genus Eurycorymbus, belonging to Sapindaceae. It is a dioecious, rare and endemic tree species of China, being listed in the National plant protection (level two). Sapindaceae is an important family with strong biological activities. However, few phytochemical studies on E. cavaleriei had been reported. The present study is focused on the phytochemical investigation of E. cavaleriei for the isolation of active natural compounds. The antioxidant activity of the phenolic glucosides was evaluated by DPPH free radical scavenging assay. Koaburaside (4) exhibited antioxidant activity with IC 50 values of 9. 0 muM. In in vitro experiment, koaburaside also showed weak inhibitory activity against influenza A neuraminidase. But none of the phenolic glucosides showed cytotoxic activity against A- 549, Bel- 7402, and HCT- 8 cells in vitro. The sample was collected from the Nanyue Arboretum (Hunan, China), and identified as the stem of E. cavaleriei. Air-dried stems (5 kg) were extracted with 90 % ethanol. After removing excessive solvent under reduced pressure, the syrup obtained was suspended in water, followed by successive partition with petroleum ether (b. p. 60 [...] 80 °C), dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol. The different fractions were purified by silica gel, RP- 18, Sephadex LH- 20, MCI Gel CHP 20 P, and semi-preparative HPLC. The structures were established on the basis of spectral analysis (including HR-MS, 1 D- and 2 D-NMR). He, Yi. Adviser: Chun-Tao Che.

40|$|Summary In this work, {{several aspects}} around {{headspace}} (HS) sampling and detection hyphenated with gas chromatography (GC) were covered. Regarding HS sampling, {{the results of}} three studies were reported around the problems encountered with the analysis of aqueous samples and/or high boiling analytes with a high affinity for the matrix in chapters 2 to 4 in this manuscript, whilst the final chapter covers the development and characterization of a novel GC detector. In chapter 2, {{the use of the}} full evaporation technique (FET) for the analysis of high boiling analytes with a high affinity for apolar matrices was evaluated and compared with the conventional static HS (sHS) sampling approach. A FET method has been developed and validated for the analysis of typical high boiling analytes (bp. > 200 °C) including camphor, menthol, methyl salicylate and <b>ethyl</b> <b>salicylate</b> that are often used in various topical formulations. Data have shown that FET is an excellent approach to circumvent matrix effects that are often encountered with sHS methods. The method showed excellent recovery and repeatability during validation and was finally applied on commercial formulations such as Radosalil , ThermoCream , Vicks Vaporub  and Reflexspray . In chapter 3, acetone acetals were employed as water scavengers for the analysis of aqueous samples using HS-GC. After optimization of the scavenging reaction conditions, the approach was used for FET analysis of various typical high boiling polar residual solvents that are miscible with water. The procedure enabled sample enrichment which provided a significant gain in sensitivity of the FET analysis of these analytes and it was finally applied on a cefotaxime sample for the quantification of residual N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP). During experiments it was revealed that the same procedure can be used for the quantitative derivatization of ethylene glycol (EG) in aqueous samples. The formation of the significantly more volatile 2, 2 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -dioxolane (2, 2 -DD) enabled determining EG using sHS sampling. In chapter 4, a novel HS approach for the analysis of quaternary ammonium salts (QAS) in aqueous samples is presented in which the reported water scavenging method from chapter 3 is used for the removal of water and sample enrichment. Screening experiments revealed that QAS substituted with benzyl and methyl groups degrade to form benzyl chloride and chloromethane under the used experimental conditions. By using chloromethane and benzyl chloride for quantification of such QAS, matching calibration standards are not needed. This means that one kind can be used for the determination of other QAS that also yield chloromethane and benzyl chloride as reaction products. The methodology was used for the analysis of denatonium benzoate (DB) in EG based cooling liquids and the analysis of benzoxonium chloride (BZOCL) or benzethonium chloride (BZTCl) in mouth sprays. Finally in chapter 5, work around the development and characterization of a novel GC detector is presented. The detector used a micro cavity hollow cathode discharge (µCHCD) plasma as ion source combined with an either positively or negatively biased capture electrode. Typical advantages of the used low power µCHCD are the increased ionization efficiency compared to the hydrogen flame used in the flame ionization detector (FID) and operation at atmospheric pressure without the need for additional gasses. During development of the µCHCD ion source {{it was found that the}} detector geometry was of great influence on the obtained signal. By adapting to a geometry with a wide anode clearance angle, a sensitive response in the pg range was obtained for various analytes including carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4) which is poorly detected with the FID. It was noticed that halogenated analytes were possibly subjected to a different ionization mechanism than the non-halogenated species. Halogenated ones most likely form negative ions in the electron rich plasma as these were most efficiently detected by a positively biased capture electrode. status: publishe...|$|E
