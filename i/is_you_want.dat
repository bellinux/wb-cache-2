2500|$|Okereke {{released}} his first solo album, titled The Boxer, produced by XXXChange, on 21 June 2010, through Wichita / Polydor in the UK and Europe and Glassnote Records {{for the rest}} of the world. The album was released under the name Kele, dropping his surname. Okereke explained the album title, saying [...] "as a boxer, you have to rely on nobody else but yourself to achieve what it <b>is</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to achieve. Even though you take hits, you have to keep focus on your priorities and keep going. I thought that was an inspiring image." [...] The first single from the album, [...] "Tenderoni", was released on 14 June 2010.|$|E
2500|$|Harrelson had {{input into}} the {{wardrobe}} for his character, Tallahassee. [...] "I never worked so long and hard on an outfit in my life," [...] he stated. [...] "What this guy wears is who he <b>is.</b> <b>You</b> <b>want</b> {{to get a sense}} of this guy as soon as you see him. So I pick out the necklaces, the sunglasses. But the hat? The minute you see that on Tallahassee, you buy him. He's real. And he's got a real cool hat". Harrelson's choice of headwear for Tallahassee came not just down to style, but also to his environmental passions: the distinctive hat is handmade in Brazil by a company called The Real Deal using recycled cargo-truck tarps and wire from old truck tires.|$|E

6000|$|His manner {{changed and}} softened, {{but not for}} any pity for his companion, but rather from some change in his own feelings.

60|$|Friends, {{as you are}} {{the sons}} and daughters of Adam, and my brethren after the flesh, often and earnest have been my desires and prayers to God on your behalf, that you may come to know your Creator to be your Redeemer, and Restorer to the holy image that through sin you have lost, by the power and Spirit of his Son Jesus Christ, whom he hath given for the light and life of the world. And O that you, who are called Christians, would receive him into your hearts! for there it <b>is</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> him, and at that door he stands knocking, that you might let him in; but you do not open to him; you are full of other guests, so that a manger is his lot among you now as well as of old. Yet you are full of profession, as were the Jews when he came among them, who knew him not, but {{rejected}} and evily entreated him. So that if you come not to the possession and experience of what you profess, all your formality and religion will stand you in no stead in the day of God's judgment.|$|E

6000|$|Dined with Sir Robert Dundas,[8] {{where we}} met Lord and Lady Melville. My little nieces (ex officio) gave us some pretty music. I {{do not know}} and cannot utter a note of music; and {{complicated}} harmonies seem to me a babble of confused though pleasing sounds. Yet songs and simple melodies, especially if connected with words and ideas, have as much effect on me as on most people. But then I hate to hear a young person sing without feeling and expression suited to the song. I cannot bear a voice that has no more life in it than a pianoforte or a bugle-horn. There is something about all the fine arts, of soul and spirit, which, like the vital principle in man, defies the research {{of the most critical}} anatomist. You feel where it is not, yet you cannot describe what it <b>is</b> <b>you</b> <b>want.</b> Sir Joshua, or some other great painter, was looking at a picture on which much pains had been bestowed--"Why, yes," [...] he said, in a hesitating manner, [...] "it is very clever--very well done--can't find fault; but it wants something; it wants--it wants, damn me--it wants THAT"--throwing his hand over his head and snapping his fingers. Tom Moore's is the most exquisite warbling I ever heard. Next to him, David Macculloch[9] for Scots songs. The last, when a boy at Dumfries, was much admired by Burns, who used to get him to try over the words which he composed to new melodies. He is brother of Macculloch of Ardwell.|$|E
