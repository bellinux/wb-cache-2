This talk will discuss roadblocks in achieving rapid content <b>delivery,</b> <b>cover</b> {{the state of the art}} on accelerating content delivery, and present further challenges as the Internet continues to evolve. It will hopefully elicit more interest and efforts in advancing content delivery acceleration that will fuel further technological breakthroughs and economic growth...|$|E
40|$|The {{elimination}} of distribution inefficiencies, occurring {{due to the}} timing of customers' orders is an important reason for companies to introduce vendor managed inventory programs. By managing their customers' inventories, suppliers {{may be able to}} reduce demand variability and therefore distribution costs. We develop technology to measure the effectiveness of distribution strategies. We develop a methodology that allows the computation of tight lower bounds on the total mileage required to satisfy customer demand over a period of time. As a result, companies will be able to gain insight into the effectiveness of their distribution strategy. This technology {{can also be used to}} suggest desirable delivery patterns and to analyze tactical and strategic decisions. Secondly, we study the inventory routing problem with continuous moves (IRP-CM). The typical inventory routing problem deals with the repeated distribution of a single product, from a single facility, with an unlimited supply, to a set of customers that can all be reached with out-and-back trips. Unfortunately, this is not always the reality. We introduce the IRP-CM to study two important real-life complexities: limited product availabilities at facilities and customers that cannot be served using out-and-back tours. We need to design delivery tours spanning several days, covering huge geographic areas, and involving product pickups at different facilities. We develop a heuristic and an optimization algorithm to construct distribution plans. The heuristic is an innovative randomized greedy algorithm, which includes linear programming based postprocessing technology. To solve the IRP-CM to optimality, we give a time-discretized integer programming model and develop a branch-and-cut algorithm. As instances of time-discretized models tend to be large we discuss several possibilities for reducing the problem size. We introduce a set of valid inequalities, called <b>delivery</b> <b>cover</b> inequalities, in order to tighten the bounds given by the LP relaxation of the time-discretized model. We also introduce branching schemes exploiting the underlying structure of the IRP-CM. An extensive computational study demonstrates the effectiveness of the optimization algorithm. Finally, we present an integrated approach using heuristics and optimization algorithms providing effective and efficient technology for solving inventory problems with continuous moves. Ph. D.

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: {{to analyze}} the {{prevalence}} of pregnancy complications and sociodemographic profile of puerperal patients with complications, according to the form of financing of the childbirth service. Method: cross-sectional study with interview of 928 puerperal women whose childbirth was financed by the Unified Health System, health plans and private sources (other sources than the Unified Health System). The sample was calculated based on the births registered in the Information System on Live Births, stratified by hospital and form of financing of the childbirth service. Data were analyzed using the chi-square and Fisherâ€™s exact tests. Results: the prevalence was 87. 8 % for all puerperal women, {{with an average of}} 2. 4 complications per woman. In the case of <b>deliveries</b> <b>covered</b> by the Unified Health System, urinary tract infection (38. 2 %), anemia (26. 0 %) and leucorrhea (23. 5 %) were more frequent. In turn, vaginal bleeding (26. 4 %), urinary tract infection (23. 9 %) and leucorrhoea (23. 7 %) were prevalent in deliveries that were not covered by the Unified Health System. Puerperal women that had their <b>delivery</b> <b>covered</b> by the Unified Health System reported a greater number of intercurrences related to infectious diseases, while women who used health plans and private sources reported intercurrences related to chronic diseases. A higher frequency of puerperal adolescents, non-white women, and women without partner among those assisted in the Unified Health System (p < 0. 001). Conclusion: the high prevalence of complications indicates the need for monitoring and preventing diseases during pregnancy, {{especially in the case of}} pregnant women with unfavorable sociodemographic characteristics...|$|R

40|$|This study aims {{to solve}} Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW), which has {{received}} considerable attention in recent years, using hybrid genetic algorithm. Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows {{is an extension}} of the well-known Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) and involves a fleet of vehicles set-off from a depot to serve a number of customers at different geographic locations with various demands within specific time windows before returning to the depot eventually. To solve this problem, this study suggests a hybrid genetic algorithm combined with Push Forward Insertion Heuristic (PFIH) to make an initial solution and Î»-interchange mechanism to neighborhood search and improving method. The proposed genetic algorithm uses an integer representation in which a string of customer identifiers represents the sequence of <b>deliveries</b> <b>covered</b> by each of the vehicles. Part of initial population is initialized using Push Forward Insertion Heuristic (PFIH) and part is initialized randomly. A Î»-interchange mechanism interchanges the customers between routes and generates neighborhood solution.

40|$|Background: Clinical {{practice}} guidelines (CPGs) recommend universal {{prenatal screening}} for Group B Streptococcus (GBS) to identify candidates for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent early onset neonatal GBS infection. Interventions to promote physician adherence to these guidelines are imperative. This {{study examined the}} effectiveness of academic detailing (AD) of obstetricians, compared with CPG mailshot and no intervention, on the screening of pregnant women for GBS. Methods: A randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted in the medical cooperative of Porto Alegre, Brazil. All obstetricians who assisted in a <b>delivery</b> <b>covered</b> by private health insurance managed by the cooperative in the 3 months preceding the study (n = 241) were invited to participate. The obstetricians were randomized to three groups: direct mail (DM, n = 76), AD (n = 76) and control (C, n = 89, no intervention). Those in the DM group were sent guidelines on GBS. The AD group received the guidelines and an educational visit detailing the guidelines, which was conducted by a trained physician. Data on obstetrician age, gender, time since graduation, whether patients received GBS screening during pregnancy, and obstetricians who requested screening were collected for all participant obstetricians for 3 months {{before and after the}} intervention, using database from the private health insurance information system. Results: Three months post-intervention, the data showed that the proportion of pregnant women screened for GBS was higher in the AD group (25. 4 %) than in the DM (15. 9 %) and C (17. 7 %) groups (P = 0. 023). Similar results emerged when the three groups were taken as a cluster (pregnant women and their obstetricians), but the difference was not statistically significant (Poisson regression, P = 0. 108). Additionally, when vaginal deliveries were analyzed separately, the proportion screened was higher in the AD group (75 %) than in the DM group (41. 9 %) and the C group (30. 4 %) (chi-square, P < 0. 001). Conclusions: The results suggest that AD increased the prevalence of GBS screening in pregnant women in this population...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{lymphatic system}} that extends {{throughout}} the whole body is one of useful targets for efficient drug delivery. The intestinal lymphatic drug delivery has been actively studied to date because administered drugs can avoid the first-pass metabolism in the liver, resulting in improvement of oral bioavailability. Drugs must be hydrophobic {{in order to be}} transported into the intestinal lymphatics because the lipid absorption mechanism in the intestine is involved in the lymphatic delivery. Therefore, various lipid-based drug carrier systems have been recently utilized to increase the transport of drug into the intestinal lymphatics. Lipidic molecules of the lipid-based drug delivery systems stimulate production of chylomicrons in the enterocytes, resulting in an increase in drug transport into lymphatic in the enterocytes. This review summarizes recently reported information on development of liposomal carriers for the intestinal lymphatic <b>delivery</b> and <b>covers</b> important determinants for successful lymphatic delivery...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Knowledge work {{processes}} {{consist of}} interleaved agile, weakly-structured processes and strictly-structured processes. Knowledge management approaches for weakly-structured, ad-hoc knowledge work processes {{need to be}} lightweight, i. e., they cannot rely on high upfront modeling effort. However, approaches for business processoriented knowledge management require intensive modeling activities. In this paper, we introduce a bottom-up strategy for proactive information <b>delivery</b> to <b>cover</b> the complete spectrum of knowledge work processes in different phases, and present a series of prototypes realizing selected phases of this strategy. Among these is a novel prototype for supporting weakly-structured processes by integrating a standard to-do list application with a state-of-the-art document classification system. The resulting system allows for a task-oriented view on an office workerâ€™s personal knowledge space in order to realize a proactive and context-sensitive information support during her daily, knowledge-intensive tasks.
