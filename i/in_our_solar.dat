25|$|In the 1970s, Thomas Gold {{proposed}} {{the theory that}} life first developed not {{on the surface of}} the Earth, but several kilometres below the surface.

Thomas Gold also asserted that a trickle of food from a deep, unreachable, source is needed for survival because life arising in a puddle of organic material is likely to consume all of its food and become extinct. Gold's theory is that the flow of such food is due to out-gassing of primordial methane from the Earth's mantle; more conventional explanations of the food supply of deep microbes (away from sedimentary carbon compounds) is that the organisms subsist on hydrogen released by an interaction between water and (reduced) iron compounds in rocks.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel activity {{to model the}} dynamics of a Jupiter-mass, trans-Neptunian planet of a highly eccentric orbit. Despite a history rooted in modern astronomy, "Planet X", a hypothesised hidden planet lurking <b>in</b> <b>our</b> outer <b>Solar</b> System, has often been touted by conspiracy theorists {{as the cause of}} past mass extinction events on Earth, as well as other modern-day doomsday scenarios. Frequently dismissed as pseudoscience by astronomers, these stories continue to draw the attention of the public by provoking mass media coverage. Targeted at junior undergraduate levels, this activity allows students to debunk some of the myths surrounding Planet X by using simulation software to demonstrate that such a large-mass planet with extreme eccentricity would be unable to enter <b>our</b> <b>Solar</b> System unnoticed, let alone maintain a stable orbit.

25|$|The {{basis for}} the modern {{understanding}} of orbits was first formulated by Johannes Kepler whose results are summarised in his three laws of planetary motion. First, {{he found that the}} orbits of the planets <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>solar</b> system are elliptical, not circular (or epicyclic), as had previously been believed, and that the Sun is not located {{at the center of the}} orbits, but rather at one focus. Second, he found that the orbital speed of each planet is not constant, as had previously been thought, but rather that the speed depends on the planet's distance from the Sun. Third, Kepler found a universal relationship between the orbital properties of all the planets orbiting the Sun. For the planets, the cubes of their distances from the Sun are proportional to the squares of their orbital periods. Jupiter and Venus, for example, are respectively about 5.2 and 0.723 AU distant from the Sun, their orbital periods respectively about 11.86 and 0.615 years. The proportionality is seen by the fact that the ratio for Jupiter, 5.23/11.862, is practically equal to that for Venus, 0.7233/0.6152, in accord with the relationship. Idealised orbits meeting these rules are known as Kepler orbits.|$|E

The likelihood that a planet at 60 - 80 AU can be scattered into Sedna's orbit is roughly 50 %; this estimate depends critically on the geometry of the flyby. Even more interesting, though, is the roughly 10 % chance that Sedna was captured from the outer disk of the passing star.

2500|$|According {{to several}} Mormon writers (such as W.

The hypothesis is also based on a passage from the Book of Abraham stating that in the Garden of Eden, time was measured [...] "after the Lord's time, which was after the time of Kolob; for as yet the Gods had not appointed to Adam his reckoning". According to the hypothesis, the reason that Earth time was measured in Kolob time was because the Earth was physically located near Kolob.
