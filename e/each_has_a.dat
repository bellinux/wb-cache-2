5|$|Below the {{regional}} level, all of England {{is divided into}} 48 ceremonial counties. These are used primarily as a geographical frame of reference and have developed gradually since the Middle Ages, with some established as recently as 1974. <b>Each</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> Lord Lieutenant and High Sheriff; these posts are used to represent the British monarch locally. Outside Greater London and the Isles of Scilly, England is also divided into 83 metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties; these correspond to areas used {{for the purposes of}} local government and may consist of a single district or be divided into several.|$|E
5|$|Cave 2 {{is similar}} to cave 1 in design. The veranda has two pillars and two {{pilaster}}s, a bench between each pillar and pilaster with curtains in the back, which have a rail pattern. Over the pillars rests the rail-patterned rock beam, above which is the ceiling. Parts of the pillars and pilasters are broken. In front over the beam project rock imitations of rafters. A doorway with grooves for a wooden frame, leads into a middle room, with a bench along the left wall. The position of the hall-cell and cell are exchanged with respect to cave 1 design. <b>Each</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> bench.|$|E
5|$|Characters can use items {{ranging from}} {{projectiles}} to melee weapons; <b>each</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> different {{effect on the}} characters around it. Although many items have returned from previous Super Smash Bros. games, new ones have been introduced as well. Some returning items have changed appearance and function. Two varieties of items, Assist Trophies and Poké Balls, temporarily summon guest characters and Pokémon, respectively, that generally aid the summoner. They cannot be controlled by players and are usually invincible.|$|E

5|$|Quantico is an American drama thriller {{series that}} premiered on September 27, 2015 on American Broadcasting Company (ABC). Created by Joshua Safran who {{also serves as}} an {{executive}} producer, along with Mark Gordon, Robert Sertner and Nicholas Pepper. The series follows {{a group of young}} FBI recruits, or New Agent Trainees (NATs); <b>each</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> specific reason for joining the FBI Academy in Quantico, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|The plot is {{traditional}} {{in regards to}} Restoration theatre and includes three female characters, three respectable males, three non-respectable males, and three side characters. Each respectable male meets their female counterpart three times, and <b>each</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> parallel incident with letters and an unmasking. The primary plot of the play deals with Wisemore and his pursuit of Lady Matchless. With {{the help of his}} friend Merital, Wisemore is able to overcome other lovers and various struggles in order to prove his worth to Matchless and win her love.|$|E
5|$|The {{station has}} a very small car park (eleven spaces) and is not {{permanently}} staffed, but it contains a ticket machine, one of an initial batch of ten installed by SPT in late 2003 and early 2004 {{as part of a}} drive to curb fare dodging, which was estimated to be costing the company £2 million a year. Both platforms are elevated and <b>each</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> wheelchair ramp. There is a connecting footbridge between the two platforms.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternative}} approach was {{the development of}} the ADS or armoured suit, which isolates the diver from the pressure at depth, at the cost of mechanical complexity and limited dexterity. The technology first became practicable in the middle 20th century. Isolation of the diver from the environment was taken further by the development of remotely operated underwater vehicles in the late 20th century, where the operator controls the ROV from the surface, and autonomous underwater vehicles, which dispense with an operator altogether. All of these modes are still in use and <b>each</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> range of applications where it has advantages over the others, though diving bells have largely been relegated to a means of transport for surface supplied divers. In some cases combinations are particularly effective, such as the simultaneous use of surface orientated or saturation surface supplied diving equipment and work or observation class remotely operated vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Each {{platform}} has two same-level fare control areas, one {{at either}} end of the station, and there are no crossovers or crossunders. The full-time ones are at the north end and <b>each</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> turnstile bank, token booth, and two street stairs. The ones on the Manhattan-bound platform go up to the northeast and southeast corners of Bergen and Smith Streets while those on the Coney Island-bound platform go up to the northwest and southwest corners. The fare control areas on the south end of the platforms are unstaffed, containing full height turnstiles and one street stair to the northeast corner of Warren and Smith Streets on the Manhattan-bound platform and the northwest corner for the Coney Island-bound platform. The south fare control area is more heavily used.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of the}} Izak {{catshark}} is {{firm and}} stout, tapering dramatically towards the tail. The head is very short, wide, and flattened, with a blunt snout. The horizontally oval eyes are placed high {{on the head and}} have thick ridges beneath; <b>each</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> rudimentary nictitating membrane and is followed by a spiracle. The nostrils are preceded by triangular flaps of skin that almost reach the long, angular mouth. The mouth contains prominent papillae on both the roof and the floor, and lacks furrows at the corners. The upper and lower jaws contain on average 65 and 60 tooth rows respectively; each tooth is relatively large, with a narrow central cusp flanked by 1–2 smaller cusplets. There are five pairs of gill slits.|$|E
50|$|<b>Each</b> {{platform}} <b>has</b> same-level exits on both ends. The east (railroad south) exits <b>each</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> turnstile {{bank and}} one staircase {{to the eastern}} side of Washington Avenue, while the west (railroad north) exits <b>each</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> turnstile bank and staircases to both sides of Clinton Avenue. The west exit on the Manhattan-bound platform also <b>has</b> <b>a</b> full-time token booth.|$|R

5|$|The cloudy {{catshark}} feeds {{primarily on}} molluscs, followed by crustaceans and bony fishes. A predator of both this shark and its egg cases is the blotchy swell shark (Cephaloscyllium umbratile). A known parasite {{of this species}} is the myxosporidian Chloromyxum scyliorhinum. Reproduction is oviparous; adult females have a single functional ovary and two functional oviducts. As a prelude to mating, the male bites at the female's pectoral fin, side, and gill region. Once he has a grip, he wraps his body around hers and inserts one of his claspers into her cloaca. Copulation may last between 15 seconds and 4 minutes. The claspers of the male are unusual in that <b>each</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> row of around a hundred hooks running along the inner margin. These hooks likely serve to anchor the male to the female during copulation. The female is capable of storing sperm within her nidamental gland (an organ that secretes egg cases) for many months.|$|E
5|$|The poem is in {{many ways}} deeply Christian, with {{frequent}} references to the fall of Adam and Eve and to Jesus Christ. Scholars have debated the depth of the Christian elements within the poem by looking at {{it in the context of}} the age in which it was written, coming up with varying views as to what represents a Christian element of the poem and what does not. For example, some critics compare Sir Gawain to the other three poems of the Gawain manuscript. <b>Each</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> heavily Christian theme, causing scholars to interpret Gawain similarly. Comparing it to the poem Cleanness (also known as Purity), for example, they see it as a story of the apocalyptic fall of a civilisation, in Gawain's case, Camelot. In this interpretation, Sir Gawain is like Noah, separated from his society and warned by the Green Knight (who is seen as God's representative) of the coming doom of Camelot. Gawain, judged worthy through his test, is spared the doom of the rest of Camelot. King Arthur and his knights, however, misunderstand Gawain's experience and wear garters themselves. In Cleanness the men who are saved are similarly helpless in warning their society of impending destruction.|$|E
5|$|The sitters are {{presented}} in three-quarter view before flat, nondescript lacquer-like green backgrounds, which although lushly coloured, are thinly layered. <b>Each</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> white ground and light red imprimatura with lead content. The sitter's form and pose echo {{and in many ways}} counterbalance each other. Brand Philip draws attention to the similarities of the panels' linear construction, especially {{the manner in which the}} folds and lines of their clothing form triangular shapes. The train of Barbara's headdress across her chest corresponds with the opening of Albrecht's fur-lined coat. It was more usual in pendant portraits of this type for the male to be on the left-hand side; the positioning here may be an indication that Dürer originally intended his father's panel to stand alone, given that Barbara's was painted some time later.|$|E

5|$|Their temple {{building}} {{activity can}} be categorised into three phases. The early phase {{began in the}} last quarter of the 6th century and resulted in many cave temples, prominent among which are three elementary cave temples at Aihole (one Vedic, one Jain and one Buddhist which is incomplete), followed by four developed cave temples at Badami (of which cave 3, a Vaishnava temple, is dated accurately to 578 CE). These cave temples at Badami are similar, in that, <b>each</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> plain exterior but an exceptionally well finished interior consisting of a pillared verandah, a columned hall (mantapa) and a cella (shrine, cut deep into rock) which contains the deity of worship. In Badami, three caves temples are Vedic and one in Jain. The Vedic temples contain large well sculpted images of Harihara, Mahishasuramardhini, Varaha, Narasimha, Trivikrama, Vishnu seated on Anantha (the snake) and Nataraja (dancing Shiva).|$|E
5|$|There are 13 {{residential}} neighbourhoods, {{each with}} a variety of housing types: terraced, semi-detached and detached houses, low-rise flats and bungalows. There are no residential tower blocks, apart from the 8 storey Milton Mount Flats at the North end of Pound Hill. Many houses have their own gardens and are set back from roads. The hub of each neighbourhood is a shopping parade, community centre and church, and <b>each</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> school and recreational open spaces as well. Crawley Development Corporation's intention was for neighbourhood shops to cater only to basic needs, and for the town centre to be used for most shopping requirements. The number of shop units provided in the neighbourhood parades reflected this: despite the master plan making provision for at least 20 shops in each neighbourhood, the number actually built ranged from 19 in the outlying Langley Green neighbourhood to just seven in West Green, close to the town centre.|$|E
