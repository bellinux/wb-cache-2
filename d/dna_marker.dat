500|$|From {{very early}} in her career, Bowling wrote about educating horse breeders on genetic {{diseases}} in purebred animals and {{how to deal with}} these conditions. She performed a number of studies on the Arabian horse breed, including research into one of the genetic diseases that affects Arabians, cerebellar abiotrophy (CA). In 1985, she created a breeding herd at UCD of horses known to carry CA, and this small group provided preliminary DNA data for researchers. Bowling's own studies of CA were unpublished {{at the time of her}} death, but she is credited with demonstrating that the condition had a recessive mode of genetic inheritance and was likely the result of a single mutated allele. [...] A <b>DNA</b> <b>marker</b> test for the condition was developed by her successors at UCD, which became available to the public in 2008. In 2011, the causative mutation for cerebellar abiotrophy was identified, and the condition was conclusively established as an autosomal recessive.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Genomic {{research}} of cultivated peanut has lagged behind other crop species {{because of the}} paucity of polymorphic <b>DNA</b> <b>markers</b> found in this crop. It is necessary to identify additional <b>DNA</b> <b>markers</b> for further genetic research in peanut. Results Microsatellite markers in cultivated peanut were developed using the SSR enrichment procedure. The {{results showed that the}} GA/CT repeat was the most frequently dispersed microsatellite in peanut. The primer pairs were designed for fifty-six different microsatellites, 19 of which showed a polymorphism among the genotypes studied. The average number of alleles per locus was 4. 25, and up to 14 alleles were found at one locus. This suggests that microsatellite <b>DNA</b> <b>markers</b> produce a higher level of DNA polymorphism than other <b>DNA</b> <b>markers</b> in cultivated peanut. Conclusions It is desirable to isolate and characterize more <b>DNA</b> <b>markers</b> in cultivated peanut for more productive genomic studies, such as genetic mapping, marker-assisted selection, and gene discovery. The development of microsatellite markers holds a promise for such studies. </p...|$|R

2500|$|Many {{companies}} offer a percentage breakdown by ethnicity or region. Generally {{the world is}} specified into about 20–25 regions, and the approximate percentage of DNA inherited from each is stated. This is usually done by comparing the frequency of each Autosomal <b>DNA</b> <b>marker</b> tested to many population groups. The reliability {{of this type of}} test is dependent on comparative population size, the number of markers tested, the ancestry informative value of the SNPs tested, and the degree of admixture in the person tested. Earlier ethnicity estimates were often wildly inaccurate, but their accuracies have since improved greatly. Usually the results at the continental level are accurate, but more specific assertions of the test {{may turn out to be}} incorrect. For example, Europeans often receive an exaggerated proportion of Scandinavian.

2500|$|Forensic DNA typing {{has been}} an {{effective}} way of identifying or exonerating criminal suspects due to analysis of evidence discovered at a crime scene. The human genome has many repetitive regions {{that can be found}} within gene sequences or in non-coding regions of the genome. Specifically, up to 40% of human DNA is repetitive. There are two distinct categories for these repetitive, non-coding regions in the genome. The first category is called variable number tandem repeats (VNTR), which are 10-100 base pairs long and the second category is called short tandem repeats (STR) and these consist of repeated 2-10 base pair sections. [...] PCR is used to amplify several well-known VNTRs and STRs using primers that flank each of the repetitive regions. The sizes of the fragments obtained from any individual for each of the STRs will indicate which alleles are present. By analyzing several STRs for an individual, a set of alleles for each person will be found that statistically is likely to be unique. [...] Researchers have identified the complete sequence of the human genome. This sequence can be easily accessed through the NCBI website and is used in many real-life applications. For example, the FBI has compiled a set of <b>DNA</b> <b>marker</b> sites used for identification, and these are called the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) DNA database. Using this database enables statistical analysis to be used to determine the probability that a DNA sample will match. [...] PCR is a very powerful and significant analytical tool to use for forensic DNA typing because researchers only need a very small amount of the target DNA to be used for analysis. For example, a single human hair with attached hair follicle has enough DNA to conduct the analysis. Similarly, a few sperm, skin samples from under the fingernails, or a small amount of blood can provide enough DNA for conclusive analysis.|$|E
2500|$|Y-chromosome haplogroup O3 is {{a common}} <b>DNA</b> <b>marker</b> in Han Chinese, as it {{appeared}} in China in prehistoric times. It is found in more than 50% of Chinese males, and ranging up to over 80% in certain regional subgroups of the Han ethnicity. Other Y-DNA haplogroups {{that have been found}} with notable frequency in samples of Han Chinese include O-P203 (15/165 = 9.1%, 47/361 = 13.0%), C-M217 (10/168 = 6.0%, 27/361 = 7.5%, 187/1730 = 10.8%, 20/166 = 12.0%), N-M231 (6/166 = 3.6%, 18/361 = 5.0%, 117/1729 = 6.8%, 17/165 = 10.3%), O-M268(xM95, M176) (54/1147 = 4.7%, 8/168 = 4.8%, 23/361 = 6.4%, 12/166 = 7.2%), and Q-M242 (2/168 = 1.2%, 49/1729 = 2.8%, 12/361 = 3.3%, 48/1147 = 4.2%). However, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of Han Chinese increases in diversity as one looks from northern to southern China, which suggests that male migrants from northern China married with women from local peoples after arriving in modern-day Guangdong, Fujian, and other regions of southern China. Despite this, tests comparing the genetic profiles of northern Han, southern Han and southern natives determined that haplogroups O1b-M110, O2a1-M88 and O3d-M7, which are prevalent in southern natives, were only observed in some southern Hans (4% on average), but not in northern Hans. Therefore, this proves that the male contribution of southern natives in southern Hans is limited, assuming that the frequency distribution of Y lineages in southern natives represents that before the expansion of Han culture that started two-thousand years ago. In contrast, there are consistent strong genetic similarities in the Y chromosome haplogroup distribution between the southern and northern Chinese population, and the result of principal component analysis indicates almost all Han populations form a tight cluster in their Y chromosome. However, other research has also shown that the paternal lineages Y-DNA O-M119, O-P201, O-P203 and O-M95 are found in both southern Han Chinese and South Chinese minorities, but more commonly in the latter. In fact, these paternal markers are in turn less frequent in northern Han Chinese. [...] Another study puts Han Chinese into two groups: northern and southern Han Chinese, and it finds that the genetic characteristics of present-day northern Han Chinese was already formed as early as three-thousand years ago in the Central Plain area.|$|E

In contrast to the high amount of genetic variation observed with the mitochondrial <b>DNA</b> <b>marker,</b> no genetic variation in a nuclear RNA marker was observed.

50|$|This {{technique}} {{is an extension}} of “chromosome walking” that allows for larger “steps” along the chromosome. If we desire to take steps of length N kb, we first require very high molecular weight DNA. Once isolated, we partially digest it with a frequent-cutting restriction enzyme (such as MboI or BamHI). Next, obtained fragments are selected for size which should be around N kb in length. DNA must then be ligated at low concentration to favour ligation into circles rather than formation of multimers. A <b>DNA</b> <b>marker</b> (such as the amber suppressor tRNA gene supF) can be included at this time point within the covalently linked circle to allow for selection of junction fragments. Circles are subsequently fully digested with a second restriction enzyme (such as EcoRI) to generate a large number of fragments. Such fragments are ligated into vectors (such as a λ vector) which should be selected for using the <b>DNA</b> <b>marker</b> introduced earlier. The remaining fragments thus represent our library of junction fragments, or “jumping library”.The next step is to screen this library with a probe that represents a “starting point” of the desired “chromosome hop”, i.e. determining the location of the genome that is being interrogated. Clones obtained from this final selection step will consist of DNA that is homologous to our probe, separated by our <b>DNA</b> <b>marker</b> from another DNA sequence that was originally located N kb away (thus being called “jumping”).By generating several libraries of different N values, we should eventually be able to map the entire genome and move from one location to another, while controlling direction, by any value of N desired.|$|E
