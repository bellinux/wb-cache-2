40|$|ABSTRACT: A reliability-based {{method for}} <b>inspection</b> <b>scheduling</b> of steel bridges is {{proposed}} to yield the optimal (most economical) inspection strategy that meets an acceptable safety level through the planned ser-vice life. Two fatigue reliability formulations {{that can be}} applied for most details in steel bridges are pre-sented. For details classified according to AASHTO fatigue categories, a limit state function related to the number of stress cycles to failure based on Miner’s rule is used to evaluate the fatigue reliability; for details not classified according to AASHTO fatigue categories, a limit state function related to crack size and growth rate is used to evaluate the fatigue reliability. The <b>inspection</b> <b>scheduling</b> problem is modeled as an optimiza-tion problem with an objective function that includes the total expected cost of inspection, repair, and failure formulated using an event tree approach, appropriate constraints on the interval between inspections, and a specified minimally acceptable (target) structural reliability. An optimal inspection-scheduling plan can thus be developed for any specified fatigue details or fracture-critical sections in steel bridges. Examples pre-sented demonstrate the advantage of the reliability-based optimal <b>inspection</b> <b>scheduling</b> in cost saving and structural reliability control over alternative inspection plans. Two case studies related to steel bridges – one for a plate girder and the other for a box girder – are presented to demonstrate the proposed reliability-based optimal <b>inspection</b> <b>scheduling</b> procedure...|$|R
50|$|Manufacturers and {{operators}} of aircraft have a financial interest in ensuring that the <b>inspection</b> <b>schedule</b> is as cost-efficient as possible. Because aircraft are often revenue producing, {{there is an opportunity}} cost associated with the maintenance of the aircraft (lost ticket revenue), in addition to the cost of maintenance itself. Thus, this maintenance is desired to be performed infrequently, even when such increased intervals cause increased complexity and cost to the overhaul. Crack growth, as shown by fracture mechanics, is exponential in nature; meaning that the crack growth rate is a function of an exponent of the current crack size (see Paris' law). A desire for infrequent inspection intervals, combined with the exponential growth of cracks in structure has {{led to the development of}} non-destructive testing methods which allow inspectors to look for very tiny cracks which are often invisible to the naked eye. Examples of this technology include eddy current, ultrasonic, dye penetrant, and X-ray inspections. By catching structural cracks when they are very small, and growing slowly, these non-destructive inspections can reduce the amount of maintenance checks, and allow damage to be caught when it is small, and still inexpensive to repair.|$|E

He won the Republican primary and the general election entirely uncontested. In 2008, he faced his first opponents: Lonnie Thompson, the Democratic nominee, and Lawrence Fisher, an independent candidate. The Orlando Sentinel endorsed Thompson over Nelson, observing, [...] "He better appreciates the important issues facing the district than does his opponent," [...] and criticizing Nelson for not protecting the Wekiva River and for not supporting property-insurance reforms. Despite this fact, Nelson won his second term over Thompson by a solid margin of victory, winning 54% of the vote to Thompson's 43% and Fisher's 3%. When Nelson ran for a third term in 2010, he did not face a Democratic opponent, but instead a member of the Florida Tea Party, James Heinzelman. Nelson ran on a platform of [...] "repealing parts of SB 550, which would impose a five-year <b>inspection</b> <b>schedule</b> on septic tanks," [...] which he said would lead to a [...] "bureaucratic and costly nightmare" [...] and on supporting SunRail, which Heinzeilman vocally opposed. Ultimately, Heinzelman did not prove to be a significant challenge for Nelson, and he won re-election with 82% of the vote. In 2012, when the legislative districts were redrawn, Nelson was moved into the 31st District, which, like his previous district, was based in Apopka, but unlike his previous district, stretched into northern Lake County and won re-election to his fourth term entirely unopposed.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{an efficient}} computational technique to perform reliability-based optimization of structural design and an <b>inspection</b> <b>schedule</b> for fatigue crack growth. Calculating structural reliability {{in the presence}} of inspection is computationally challenging because crack size distribution has to be updated after each inspection to simulate replacement. An exact evaluation using Monte Carlo simulation is time consuming because large sample size is required for estimating accurately a low probability of failure. In this paper a less expensive approximate method is proposed to calculate reliability with inspection, combining Monte Carlo simulation and a first-order reliability method. We use Monte Carlo simulation with a small sample to update the probability distribution of crack sizes after inspection andafirst-order reliabilitymethod to calculate the failure probability at any timebetween inspections.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} improve the current {{pavement}} inspection systems, many studies have attempted to produce a flexible <b>inspection</b> <b>schedule</b> by minimizing the lifecycle cost of pavement management system. However, these methods do not incorporate the risk of untimely inspection nor adopt the state-of-art intelligent transportation resources, such as traffic data from various infrastructures, flow prediction models with high accuracy, and empirical-mechanistic models for pavement deterioration process. Therefore, this paper proposes a framework to optimize a flexible <b>inspection</b> <b>schedule</b> within a risk boundary defined by pavement state prediction with traffic flow data and a more mechanistic deterioration model. The results validate the outperformance of the optimized inspection over two conventional inspection schemes – 1 -year and 2 -year regular inspection.

40|$|Infrastructures are {{considered}} as important facilities required for every country and society {{to be able}} to work properly. Aging and deterioration of such structures during their lifetime are a major concern both for maintenance researchers in the academic world and for the practitioners. This concern is mainly because the deterioration increases the maintenance costs dramatically and lowers the reliability, availability, and safety of the structural system. Preventive maintenance and inspection activities are the most usual means for keeping the structure in a good condition. This paper utilizes the concept of delay-time for developing the optimal inspection policy for deteriorating structures. In the proposed stochastic model, discrete times of inspection activities are taken as the decision variables of an optimization problem, in a way that the obtained aperiodic (nonuniform) <b>inspection</b> <b>schedule</b> minimizes the total downtime ratio of the structure. To illustrate the model capabilities, various numerical examples are solved and results are compared with the traditional periodic (uniform) inspection policies.

40|$|Non-destructive testing (NDI) {{techniques}} are routinely used in bridge inspection. However, detection accuracy, accessibility, cost {{and consequences of}} false indication are all factors to consider when selecting the NDI techniques to be used. A probabilistic method is proposed to help select the most suitable NDI technique and an associated optimal schedule for fracture-critical member/detail inspections on a specified steel bridge. The Probability of Detection (POD) curve for each NDI technique which denotes its detection accuracy is employed. In addition, by combining probability calculations based {{on the use of}} the POD curve together with numerical Monte Carlo simulations for crack propagation in the fracture-critical detail, a total cost function is formulated that includes the expected cost of inspections, repair and failure resulting from the chosen NDI method and alternative inspection schedules. In summary, the selection of an NDI method with an associated <b>inspection</b> <b>schedule</b> for fracture-critical inspections is formulated as an optimization problem which utilizes appropriate constraints on inspection intervals and on a minimum acceptable (target) structural reliability.
