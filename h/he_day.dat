Passionately and reproachfully and wonderingly Jane had refused even to entertain such an idea. And now Lassiter never advised it again, grew sadder and quieter in his contemplation of the child, and infinitely more gentle and loving.

The environment defined by the context of globalisation and privatisation has implied fiscal compression and the consequent scarcity of resources at all levels of Government.

Public-private participation is the order of <b>he</b> <b>day.</b> It is in this context that this paper argues for a role for newer financial instruments like â€˜municipal-bondsâ€™. The paper also argues that for these initiatives to be successful, a thick and efficient secondary market in this segment of debt market is crucial.

40|$|Our {{aim was to}} {{quantify}} the intestinal metabolic fate of dietary alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG). Female pigs In = 6; 21 d old) were implanted with arterial, venous, portal and gastric catheters and an ultrasonic portal flow probe and fed a corn and soybean meal-based diet. On (t) <b>he</b> <b>day</b> of the experiment, the pigs received a 4 -h intragastric infusion of sodium AKG at a rate equivalent to 0, 2. 5, 5 or 10 % of dietary intake. The net portal AKG balance of the control and 2. 5 % treatments did not differ and were not different from zero. However, the net portal AKG balance of both the 5 [163 mumol/(kg (.) h) ] and 10 % [159 mumol/(kg (.) h) ] treatments were greater (P < 0. 05) than the control. Despite significant net AKG absorption at the 5 and 10 % levels, the net portal appearance represented only 10. 8 and 6. 7 %, respectively, of the enteral input. The net portal appearances of glutamate, glutamine, ammonia and the branched-chain amino acids were not affected by dietary AKG level. We conclude that the absorption of dietary AKG is limited in young pigs and {{does not change the}} net portal balance of amino acids or ammonia...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. 03 {{production}} in the Nashville urban plume during the 03 episode that occurred on July I l-July 13 1995, is examined to characterize the factors that control the ozone production rate and efficiency, and to examine {{the relative importance of}} natural and anthropogenic sources of hydrocarbons to ozone {{production in}} the urban center and outlying areas. The analysis focuses on data collected during aircraft flights on July 11 when the Nashville area was sampled more or less continuously from about 1000 to 1800 LT. The instantaneous ozone production rate P(O 3) in the downtom area from late morning through midafternoon on July 11 ranged between 10 and greater than 30 ppbv/h depending on location. After 1700 local time, production rates dropped to a few ppbv/h owing to the diminished solar intensity. Instantaneous production efficiencies with respect to NOx in the downtown area ranged between 2. 5 and 8, linearly depending on the ratio of the hydrocarbon to NOx, OH reactivity. Integral O 3 production efficiencies corrected for NOz losses ranged between 1. 5 and 4. The lowest efficiency was observed in the downtown area in the morning where NO • concentrations were high and hydrocarbon to NOx reactivity ratios were the lowest. Throughout <b>he</b> <b>day,</b> P(O 3) in the downtown area was limited by the availability of hydro-carbons. Anthropogenic hydrocarbons and CO contributed about 66 % of the total hydrocarbo...|$|E
40|$|Background: In {{the past}} day-care {{facilities}} {{for people with}} dementia were developed with little input from the users. As these facilities play art increasingly {{important role in the}} lives of the growing number of community-living persons with dementia and their caregivers, it now seems obvious to incorporate users' perspectives when establishing or optimizing day care. This study addresses the needs and wishes of informal caregivers when providing skilled psychogeriatric day-care in the Netherlands. Method: This is a qualitative, exploratory study, based on interviews with family caregivers and professional focus groups as the primary data source. Results: Using data from the interviews, the needs and wishes of carers were classed into three general domains: (1) approach to care - relating to shared and tailored care and confidence in professionals as well as the facility as important themes; (2) professional expertise - relating to the caters' need for education and information regarding dementia, available resources, as well as cooperation between professionals, and (3) the day program - concerning the content and structure oft <b>he</b> <b>day</b> care. Conclusions: The interviews with the caregivers suggest that the relationship with day-care personnel is an important aspect of psychogeriatric day-care. Caregivers have high expectations regarding the expertise of professionals, but seem to be unaware of available resources and services. Professionals should play a more active role in providing education, advice and support. Above all, the attendees must have a positive experience of the day-care facilities and its activities...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Nursing)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. The nursing {{education}} leader provides visionary leadership to his/her organisation, {{as well as}} to the profession of nursing, and must have t he authority and resources necessary to ensure {{nursing education}} and training standards are met. This link between professional practice and operational activity of the organisation leads to greater involvement in decision making and fosters collaboration within nursing education and training and interdisciplinary teams. A collaborative approach contributes to quality education and training. It involves lecturers participating in a common vision for their workplaces and being recognised for their unique contribution. Nursing education leadership is required to work out work schedules and to ensure that proper service rendering is at the order of t <b>he</b> <b>day.</b> Nursing education leaders are appointed according to their academic achievement and not their managerial or leadership skills. Policies, t he environment, and the workplace have, however changed significantly over the past couple of years. This has left nursing education leaders without a proper model to manage and lead the structure of their Nursing Education Institutions. As part of the process of reaching the academic level, leadership skills will play a secondary role. Although this. is the reality, leadership skills need to be addressed as part of the total armour of the nursing education leader. Based on the problem statement the following research questions were posed: -• How can a model for transformational leadership be developed for nursing education ?leaders in Nursing Education Institutions. To answer this question the following sub questions were posed: -• What are the concepts and related concepts in transformational leadership for nursing education leaders in the context of Nursing Education Institution? • What is the relationship between these concepts and how can these relationships be constructed for the development of a model for transformational leadership for nursing education in the Nursing Education Institution? As it is the researcher's intention to identify the concepts from an emic perspective, the following questions were formulated: • What are the expectations of the lecturers, students and administrative personnel of nursing education leaders? • What are present leadership styles used by nursing education leaders? The overall aim of this study was to: • Develop a model for transformational leadership for nursing education leaders in Nursing Education Institutions. In order to achieve this aim the following objectives were formulated: PHASE 1 OBJECTIVES The objectives of phase 1 were formulated to enable the identification and classification of concepts in relations to transformation to transformational leadership of nursing education leaders in the Nursing Education Institutions. These objectives were as follows: • Phase 1 (a) To explore and describe the expectations of the nurse educators, students and administrative personnel from nursing education leaders. To describe the present leadership styles used by nursing education leaders. PHASE 2 OBJECTIVES To develop and describe a model for transformational leadership for nursing education leaders in the Nursing Education Institutions, the following objectives were formulated: Phase 2 (a) : To describe the concepts in the model for transformational leadership for nursing education leaders in the Nursing Education Institutions Phase 2 (b) : To construct relational statements between concepts, Phase 2 (c) : To critically reflect on the model for transformational leadership for nursing education leaders in the Nursing Education InstitutionsDoctora...|$|E
