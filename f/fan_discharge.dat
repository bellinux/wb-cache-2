The evaluation criteria come from ANSI/HPS N 13. 1 - 1999, “Sampling and Monitoring Releases of Airborne Radioactive Substances from the Stacks and Ducts of Nuclear Facilities. ” Pacific Northwest National Laboratory conducted the tests on a 3. 67 : 1 scale model of the stack. Limited confirmatory tests on the actual stack will need to be conducted during cold startup of the High Level Waste Treatment Facility. The tests documented here assessed the capability of the air-monitoring probe to extract a sample representative of the effluent stream in accordance with criteria in ANSI/HPS N 13. 1. The test parameters covered the expected range of system flowrates with both one and two operating fans. The current stack design calls for the sampling probe to be located about 10 diameters downstream of the junction of the duct from Fan A with the stack. In accordance with the statement of work and the test plan, the test measurements were made at that location and also at one point upstream and another downstream. An adjustment was made for the distance between a typical sampling probe inlet and the centerline of its mounting flange.

5000|$|Specific thrust (net thrust/intake airflow) is an {{important}} parameter for turbofans and jet engines in general. Imagine a fan (driven by an appropriately sized electric motor) operating within a pipe, which is connected to a propelling nozzle. It is fairly obvious, the higher the fan pressure ratio (<b>fan</b> <b>discharge</b> pressure/fan inlet pressure), the higher the jet velocity and the corresponding specific thrust. Now imagine we replace this set-up with an equivalent turbofan - same airflow and same fan pressure ratio. Obviously, {{the core of the}} turbofan must produce sufficient power to drive the fan via the low-pressure (LP) turbine. If we choose a low (HP) turbine inlet temperature for the gas generator, the core airflow needs to be relatively high to compensate. The corresponding bypass ratio is therefore relatively low. If we raise the turbine inlet temperature, the core airflow can be smaller, thus increasing bypass ratio. Raising turbine inlet temperature tends to increase thermal efficiency and, therefore, improve fuel efficiency.|$|E

During deposition of at least the uppermost 100 m of <b>fan</b> deposits, <b>discharges</b> from the source basin consisted of channelized flows transporting sediment (which we infer to be primarily sand- and gravel-sized) as bedload coupled with extensive overbank mud-rich flows depositing planar beds of sand-sized or finer sediment. Flow events are inferred to have been of modest magnitude (probably less than ~ 60 m 3 /s), of short duration, and probably occupied only a few distributaries during any individual flow event. Occasional channel avulsions resulted {{in the distribution of}} sediment across the entire fan. A comparison with fine-grained alluvial fans in Chile’s Atacama Desert provides insights into the processes responsible for constructing the Saheki crater fans: sediment is deposited by channelized flows (transporting sand through boulder-sized material) and overbank mudflows (sand size and finer) and wind erosion leaves channels expressed in inverted topographic relief. The most likely source of water was snowmelt released after annual or epochal accumulation of snow in the headwater source basin on the interior crater rim during the Hesperian to Amazonian periods.

40|$|In {{order to}} support the air {{emissions}} permit for the 3410 Building, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory performed {{a series of tests}} in the exhaust air discharge from the reconfigured 3410 Building Filtered Exhaust Stack. The objective was to determine whether the location of the air sampling probe for emissions monitoring meets the applicable regulatory criteria governing such effluent monitoring systems. In particular, the capability of the air sampling probe location to meet the acceptance criteria of ANSI/HPS N 13. 1 - 2011, Sampling and Monitoring Releases of Airborne Radioactive Substances from the Stack and Ducts of Nuclear Facilities was determined. The qualification criteria for these types of stacks address 1) uniformity of air velocity, 2) sufficiently small flow angle with respect to the axis of the duct, 3) uniformity of tracer gas concentration, and 4) uniformity of tracer particle concentration. Testing was performed to conform to the quality requirements of NQA- 1 - 2000. Fan configurations tested included all fan combinations of any two fans at a time. Most of the tests were conducted at the normal flow rate, while a small subset of tests was performed at a slightly higher flow rate achieved with the laboratory hood sashes fully open. The qualification criteria for an air monitoring probe location are taken from ANSI/HPS N 13. 1 - 2011 and are paraphrased as follows with key results summarized: 1. Angular Flow—The average air velocity angle must not deviate from the axis of the stack or duct by more than 20 °. Our test results show that the mean angular flow angles at the center two-thirds of the ducts are smaller than 4. 5  for all testing conditions. 2. Uniform Air Velocity—The acceptance criterion is that the COV of the air velocity must be ≤ 20 % across the center two thirds of the area of the stack. Our results show that the COVs of the air velocity across the center two-thirds of the stack are smaller than 2. 9 % for all testing conditions. 3. Uniform Concentration of Tracer Gases—The uniformity of the concentration of potential contaminants is first tested using a tracer gas to represent gaseous effluents. The tracer is injected downstream of the fan outlets and at the junction downstream <b>fan</b> <b>discharges</b> meet. The acceptance criteria are that 1) the COV of the measured tracer gas concentration is ≤ 20 % across the center two-thirds of the sampling plane and 2) at no point in the sampling plane does the concentration vary from the mean by > 30 %. Our test results show that 1) the COV of the measured tracer gas concentration is 6. 5 %. 4. Uniform Concentration of Tracer Particles—Tracer particles of 10 -μm aerodynamic diameter are used for the second demonstration of concentration uniformity. The acceptance criterion is that the COV of particle concentration is ≤ 20 % across the center two thirds of the sampling plane. Our test results indicate that the COV of particle concentration is < 9. 9 % across the center two-thirds of the sampling plane among all testing conditions. Thus, the reconfigured 3410 Building Filtered Exhaust Stack was determined to meet the qualification criteria given in the ANSI/HPS N 13. 1 - 2011 standard.

40|$|This thesis studies airflow {{patterns}} in the face area of a typical room-and-pillar mining area, using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling. This research is designed to develop a scientific understanding of airflow distribution in room-and-pillar mining areas that is fundamental to developing engineering controls. The overall goal {{of the study is}} to develop improved engineering controls to minimize dust exposure of mine workers in the face area. Dust exposure can be a health hazard in underground coal mining industry based on historical data of coal workers 2 ̆ 7 pneumoconiosis among underground mine workers. Current regulatory dust exposure standards of 1. 5 mg/m 3, averaged over an 8 -hour period, have been recently revised with approval of new MSHA standards in April of 2014. Mining companies are currently seeking new technologies in order to comply with the new dust standards. Since mining geometries are complex and do not lend themselves to closed-form analytical solutions, CFD numerical modeling approach was used to develop an understanding of airflow distribution in the face areas. Since previous studies had focused on some cuts in mining heights of less than 2. 4 m (8 -ft), this study was performed for high mining areas of 4. 2 m (14 -ft). Such mining heights are very common in longwall mine development areas, particularly in the State of Illinois. The primary goal was to identify major differences in airflow between the two mining heights and how they affect development of engineering controls for minimizing dust exposure. Simulations were done using ANSYS software such as DesignModeler for modeling and meshing and FLUENT for calculations. Recirculation (RC) and low air velocity (LAV) zones were located for straight deep cut, straight deepest cut, cross-cut right, cross-cut right mine through, left turn cross-cut, and left turn cross-cut mine through for low mining height (LMH) and high mining height (HMH) with varying air quantity {{at the end of the}} line curtain (ELC). Air at the ELC was adjusted to achieve a ratio of 0. 85, 1. 00 and 1. 15 over the wet scrubber <b>fan</b> (WSF) <b>discharge</b> capacity. Results show that the air velocity in HMH case is much lower than for the LMH. In addition, the location of RC and LAV zones differ based on mining height and air quantity at the ELC. Furthermore, lower air quantity at the ELC causes the air exhausted by the WSF to recirculate back to the face area in order to satisfy the WSF requirement. Recommendations to deal with these differences are formulated...|$|R

Five airflow estimation methods were studied. The Reference Method was a fan corrected airflow to fan corrected speed calibration from an uninstalled engine test. In-flight airflow estimation methods utilized the average, or individual, inlet duct static- to total-pressure ratios, and the average fan-discharge static-pressure to average inlet total-pressure ratio. Correlations were established at low distortion conditions for each method relative to the Reference Method. A range of distorted inlet flow conditions were obtained from - 10 deg. to + 60 deg. angle of attack and - 7 deg. to + 11 deg. angle of sideslip. The individual inlet duct pressure ratio correlation resulted in a 2. 3 percent airflow spread for all distorted flow levels with a bias error of - 0. 7 percent. The <b>fan</b> <b>discharge</b> pressure ratio correlation gave results with a 0. 6 percent airflow spread with essentially no systematic error.

40|$|SYNOPSIS Hovercraft lift {{fans are}} {{subjected}} to varying back pressure due to wave action and craft motions when these vehicles are operating in a seaway. The oscillatory back pressure causes the fans to perform dynamically, exhibiting a hysteresis type of response and a corresponding degrada-tion in mean performance. Since hovercraft motions are influenced by variations in lift fan pressure and discharge, {{it is important to}} un-derstand completely the nature of the dynamic performance of lift fans in order to completely solve the hovercraft seakeeping problem. The present study was performed to determine and classify the insta-bilities encountered in a centrifugal fan operating against time-varying back pressure. A model-scale experiment was developed in which the <b>fan</b> <b>discharge</b> was directed into a flow-measuring device, terminating in a rotating valve which produced an oscillatory back pressure superimposed upon a mean aerodynamic resistance. Pressure and local velocity were measured as functions of time at several locations in the fan volute.

40|$|Dimensional {{restrictions}} in electronic equipment {{have resulted in}} miniaturisation of many existing cooling technologies. In addition, cooling solutions are required to dissipate increased thermal loads to maintain component reliability and user comfort. Fans are widely used in electronics cooling to meet such thermal demands, either in standalone for direct component cooling, or in combination with a heat sink. The thermal performance of such designs when scaled to dimensions suitable for use in portable electronics has received limited attention, mainly due to the reliance on passive cooling methodologies currently employed. However, as heat flux increases, passive cooling is reaching its limit and other solutions will be required. This thesis aims {{to address this issue}} by experimentally examining the fluid dynamics and thermal performance of forced convection cooling solutions with dimensional constraints. Conventional finned and novel finless heat sink designs have been integrated with commercially available radial blowers to investigate cooling solutions with overall foot print areas as low as 487 mm 2, and profile heights less than 5 mm. The novel finless geometry, with reduced manufacturing cost, energy consumption and weight promoted heat transfer above that of the same size classical finned designs for a range of operating points. Both geometries showed increases of up to 20 % in thermal performance by aligning the fan exit flow with the heat sink channels, hence demonstrating the need for integrated fan and heat sink design of low profile applications. Optimisation and geometry selection criteria were determined by scaling profile height for both heat sink designs from 4 mm to 1 mm. Theoretical predictions under estimated the finless design thermal performance, which was found to scale towards that of a turbulent flow regime despite the low Reynolds number. The mechanisms of this improvement in heat flux was investigated and unique, heat transfer enhancing, features in the finless design were identified. A combined infrared thermography and heated-thin-foil technique was developed for miniature fan applications, to accurately determine local heat transfer coe cients due to radial and axial fan flows. This highlighted the non-uniform heat transfer rates produced by the three-dimensional air patterns from rotating fans, and {{has been shown to be}} an important consideration in the design stages for component cooling. For the same chip temperature, strategic positioning of electronic components resulted in up to three-fold gains in power dissipation for direct component cooling applications. Local peaks in heat transfer coe cient when using axial fan impingement were directly related to the air flow and fan motor support interaction. It was found that for optimum thermal performance, motor support dimensions should be kept to a minimum and positioned on the inlet flow plane, the opposite to the current industrial practice. Flow structures and surface heat transfer trends due to radial fan flows were found to be common over a wide range of fan aspect ratios (blade height to fan diameter). The limiting aspect ratio for heat transfer enhancement was 0. 3, as larger aspect ratios were shown to result in a reduction in overall thermal performance. Results also indicate that low profile radial fan designs are not just limited to portable devices, but may also be a practical solution to thermal management issues in larger scale electronics. A practical operating condition was represented by the introduction of a uniform crossing air flow above a radial fan inlet and indirectly reduced surface heat transfer. A distorted inflow shifted the surface heat transfer distribution from an axisymmetric to asymmetric profile for a radially <b>discharging</b> <b>fan</b> design. Overall, the findings presented in this thesis are fundamentally and practically useful for the design of forced convection cooling solutions using rotating fans in space restricted applications...|$|R
40|$|Many ancient {{sedimentary}} basins {{are interpreted}} as endorheic basins, internally drained basins with no direct hydrological {{connection to the}} marine environment. Some of these endorheic basins are economically important because of the abundance of hydrocarbon resources. To date, many {{studies have been conducted}} on fluvial systems in endorheic basins; however, the fluvial architecture and facies distribution in ancient fluvial systems are not fully understood. Although they are an important key to rock record interpretation, modern terminal fluvial systems in semi-arid endorheic basins are rarely reported due to difficulties such as poor accessibility. The major objectives of this study are to: (1) investigate the development in space and time of the channel morphology and sediment distribution of a distal fluvial system in a semi-arid climatic setting, and (2) to build a quantitative data set {{for the construction of a}} 3 D sedimentary architecture model. The study is carried out on a river terminus system, the Río Colorado, at the edge of the world’s largest salt lake, the Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia. This unconfined and largely non-vegetated river terminus provides the opportunity to acquire a large data set including field and satellite data that enables analysing the development of channel morphologies and sediment characteristics (e. g., avulsion history, splay morphology and surface dynamics). The data acquisition consists of daily precipitation data, a Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM), a time-series Landsat imagery and high resolution WorldView- 02 and QuickBird- 02 satellite images, as well as surface and shallow sediment samples and high precision GPS data (Chapter 1). Changes in channel morphology of the terminal fluvial system are a function of the precipitation intensity in the catchment area (Chapter 2). The catchment area is characteristic of a mean slope of 0. 0008 m/m with the highest slope near the margin and gradually decreasing slope downstream, as well as higher vegetation cover in the mountainous regions than that in the tributary delta and terminal fluvial <b>fan.</b> Ten peak <b>discharge</b> events with more than 50 m 3 /s have been pinpointed between 1985 and 1999. The peak discharges resulted in massive flood-out of water and sediment onto the floodplain in the very low gradient river terminus and with a cross sectional channel area of less than 80 m 2. The development in space and time of crevasse splays and local avulsions was visualized by comparing Landsat MSS and TM images before and after peak discharge events. Crevasse splays expanded in peak discharge periods, and this led to amalgamation with adjacent crevasse splays by compensational stacking. The areal extent of the crevasse splays did not change in between peak discharge events. Multiple local avulsions were distinguished between 1975 and 2001. Crevasse splays and their crevasse channels can evolve over time to an entirely new river channel. Erosion greatly exceeds accretion on both banks of the river in the tributary catchment. The prominent river bank erosion is associated with an evolving channel planform such as meander morphology, channel morphology and river pattern development (Chapter 3). Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) analysis and field investigations suggest that non-vegetation cover and abundance of desiccation cracks and burrows are the main contributors to bank erosion. Changes in channel planform are the product of continuous lateral migration and frequent overbank flooding. Shallow channels and poor development of levees in combination with in-channel accretionary benches result in frequent overbank flooding, which lead to a high density of crevasse splays over unconsolidated river banks and accretionary benches. Avulsion and chute channels together with reactivation of partially abandoned meanders and connection of headcuts and crevasse channels produce an anabranching pattern in the study area. Crevasse splays have been categorized into three classes based on their development in space and time: new crevasse splays (NCS), changing crevasse splays (CCS) and inactive crevasse splays (ICS) (Chapter 4). The occurrence of these three types of crevasse splays shows no relationship with distance along the stream. The local gradient also shows no correlation with the number of crevasse splays. By contrast, the number of crevasse splay shows an exponential increase as the cross-sectional channel area decreases. In addition, some crevasse splays are attributed to the topographic low between adjacent crevasse splays and fill in the depression by compensational stacking. The unconfined area of the system showed great variations in sediment composition downstream. The alluvial fan segment is characterized by gravel with a fining-upward sequence, whereas the upper coastal plain segment is typified by coarse sand and some fine gravel in the upstream area, grading to fine sand downstream. Silt and clay are the dominant sediments in the lower coastal plain segment, although there is also some very fine sand. It was found that the study area is characterized by a linear decrease downstream in bedload and correspondingly an increase in suspended load deposits (Chapter 5). Thus, in the upper coastal plain bedload deposits dominate, while in the lower coastal plain suspended load deposits are prominent. A spectral library has been established for four types of surface materials using Landsat surface reflectance in combination with Landsat CDR data and field data analysis (Chapter 6). Four types of surface materials are distinguished in the river terminus: A: salty surface; B: silt-rich surface; C, clay-rich surface; D: salt. The silt-rich surface has a weak correlation with the annual precipitation while the salty surface tends to be inversely proportional to the annual precipitation. There is no relationship between the clay-rich surface and the annual precipitation. The main geomorphological changes have been identified as the formation of crevasse splays and avulsions. High annual precipitation-induced avulsions are found to lead to increased silt-rich surfaces. Channel and splay morphodynamics, longitudinal sediment dispersion pattern in the system, and surface composition in the river terminus are the focus of this study. The expected preservation potential and sequence stratigraphy of the Río Colorado system is discussed. Future work on such dryland river systems could include investigations of the mechanisms of fluvial discontinuity at the boundary between alluvial fan and upper coastal plain, the interaction between aeolian dunes and fluvial systems in the Río Colorado river system, and groundwater regimes in the coastal plain (Chapter 7) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of static pressure reset (SPR) control to save fan energy in variable air volume HVAC systems {{has been well}} documented. Current {{research has focused on}} the creation of reset strategies depending on specific system features. As the commissioning process has begun to require the prediction of savings, knowledge {{of the extent to which}} various SPR control strategies impact fan energy has become increasingly important. This research aims to document existing SPR control strategies and utilize building data and simulation to estimate fan energy use. A comprehensive review of the literature pertaining to SPR control was performed and the results were organized into a top-down flow chart tool. Based on the type of feedback available from a particular system, or lack thereof, this tool will facilitate the selection of a SPR control strategy. A field experiment was conducted on a single duct variable air volume system with fixed discharge air temperature and static pressure setpoints. Finally, an air-side model of the experimental system was created using detailed building design information and calibrated using field measurements. This model was used to estimate the fan energy required to supply the trended airflow data using fixed static pressure (FSP) and SPR control based on zone demand, system demand, and outside air temperature. While utilizing trend data from November 1, 2008 to February 12, 2009, the FSP control of the experimental system was used as the baseline for ranking the energy savings {{potential of}} nine different forms of duct static pressure control. The highest savings (73 - 74 %) were achieved using zonal demand based SPR control. System demand based SPR control yielded savings ranging from 59 to 76 %, which increased when the duct sensor was positioned near the <b>fan</b> <b>discharge</b> and under similar zone load conditions. The outside air temperature based SPR control yielded savings of 65 % since the experimental system supplied primarily perimeter zones. Finally, increasing the FSP setpoint from 2 to 3 inWG increased fan energy by 45 %, while decreasing the setpoint from 2 to 1 inWG decreased fan energy by 41 %...|$|E
