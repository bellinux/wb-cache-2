40|$|Abstract. For the {{supervision}} and control on the unattended <b>electromechanical</b> <b>equipments,</b> this paper applies industrial Ethernet technology {{to the design of}} RTU (Remote Terminal Unit) in SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) system. The hardware design of RTU is centered on STM 32 F 107 VC, which includes network communication interface, I/O (Input/Output) interface and local memory circuit. The software design, based on the midware of RL-ARM provided by ARM Ltd, comprises multi-task network communication, web server for remote configuration and file system for temporary data storage. The applications show that this intelligent RTU has properties of high reliability, good real-time, high EMC, small volume, low cost and simple implementation...|$|R

50|$|The {{success of}} Line 1 as a turnkey project {{acquired}} from Siemens with 100% imported <b>electromechanical</b> <b>equipment</b> prompted {{a wave of}} similar proposals from twelve other cities in mainland China {{toward the end of}} the 1990s. The fever for import-centric rapid transit caused the State Planning Committee to temporarily halt approval of rapid transit projects nationwide and regulate the localisation rates of rolling stock suppliers. Amid tightened regulation, only Line 2 of Guangzhou Metro received the immediate green light to proceed in June 1998 on the condition that at least 60% of its <b>electromechanical</b> <b>equipment</b> must be sourced domestically.|$|E

40|$|For pumping {{stations}} installed blade full-adjustable pumps with frequently varying {{head in a}} wide range, adjusting {{pump blade}} angles is {{an effective way to}} realize optimum operation. Optimal mathematical models were established aiming at the least daily operation cost for pumping station system, which includes main pump units, inlet and outlet passages and their accessories, forebay and outlet pond, auxiliary equipment, power transmission and transformation <b>equipment,</b> other <b>electromechanical</b> <b>equipments</b> and lightings. Also, head varying, time-varying electrical price, and blade adjusting frequency are all taken into account. Meanwhile, the influences of the blade adjusting frequency on operation cost are researched. The results indicate that the operation cost is reduced by 5. 64 %∼ 12. 13 % by the optimal schemes considering time-varying electrical price and adjusting pump blade angles than that of conventional schemes, taking Jiangdu Forth Pumping Station in China as a case. The more the blade adjusting frequency, the less the operation cost. Also, if the blade adjusting frequency exceeds eight times, the optimum operation cost is close to be a const. Therefore, it is advisable to adjust blade angles four to six times a day to save operation cost and guarantee the reliability of pump units...|$|R
25|$|Part of the {{previous}} permissive dialing plan included a mass calling prefix for radio station contests, introduced in the 1960s because some contests put unacceptable loads on the Bay Area's telephone switches.

40|$|Background: A new {{biological}} {{domestic wastewater}} treatment process, {{which has been}} presented these days in activated sludge modification, is Upflow Sludge Blanket Filtration (USBF). This process is aerobic and acts by using a sludge blanket in the separator of sedimentation tank. All biological flocs and suspended solids, which are presented in the aeration basin, pas through this blanket. The performance of a single stage USBF process for treatment of domestic wastewater was studied in laboratory scale. Methods: The pilot of USBF has been made from fiberglass and the main <b>electromechanical</b> <b>equipments</b> consisted of an air com­pressor, a mixing device and two pumps for sludge return and wastewater injection. The wastewater samples used for the experiments were prepared synthetically to have qualitative characteristics similar to a typical domestic wastewater (COD= 277 mg/l, BOD 5 = 250 mg/l and TSS= 1 mg/l). Results: On the average, the treatment system was capable to remove 82. 2 % of the BOD 5 and 85. 7 % of COD in 6 h hydraulic re­tention time (HRT). At 2 h HRT BOD and COD removal efficiencies dramatically reduced to 50 % and 46. 5 %, respectively. Conclusion: Even by increasing the concentrations of pollutants to as high as 50 %, the removal rates of all pollutants were re­mained similar to the HRT of 6 h...|$|R
