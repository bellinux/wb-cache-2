The Atreides rule is cut short by a murderous conspiracy crafted by the Harkonnens and Emperor himself. Leto's son Paul Atreides (known by the Fremen as Muad'Dib) later leads a massive Fremen army to victory over the Emperor's Sardaukar soldier-fanatics, and by threatening the destruction of all spice production on Arrakis manages to depose Shaddam and ascend the throne in his place. With Emperor Paul worshipped as a god, Arrakis becomes the governmental and religious center of the Imperium.|$|E

This research was conducted to measure the time and productivity of forest <b>harvesting</b> <b>operation</b> and also to analyze the cost and revenue of mangrove forest <b>harvesting</b> <b>operation</b> at Matang mangrove forest. This project had been carried out in cooperation with Seri Sepetang Enterprise, one of the harvesting licenses in Kuala Sepetang, Perak. Data collections were taken in every station starting from standing tree until to the Kiln-Drying jetty. The data then calculated by using the formulas of productivity and cost analysis. As the result, the productivity for felling, bucking and debarking, the manual skidding using wheel-barrow and the water transportation are 1. 84 tan/hour, 3. 82 tan/hour and 4. 64 tan/hour respectively. The cost for each operation of 9 tan log volume for felling, bucking and debarking, the manual skidding using wheel-barrow and the water transportation are RM 56. 88, RM 10. 80 and RM 36. 72 respectively. As the revenue, the company paid RM 260 per 9 tan of log for the in-forest operation (felling, manual skidding and loading to the ship) and pay RM 80 per 9 tan for the water transportation, and they gained the net profit of RM 192. 32 and RM 43. 28 respectively. The average of forest <b>harvesting</b> <b>operation</b> is twice operation in a day (equal with 2 x 9 -ton volume of log production a day), so they will gain a double profit. In conclusion, the forest <b>harvesting</b> <b>operation</b> is sustainably managed for supplying the raw material of charcoal industries in Matang mangrove forest. Since, they work manually and spend much energy in this forest <b>harvesting</b> <b>operation,</b> so for further study it recommends to conduct the ergonomics evaluation during forest <b>harvesting</b> <b>operation</b> at Matang Mangrove Forest...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{limitations}} for reaching sustainable forest development {{is related to the}} traffic of machines and vehicles during <b>harvest</b> <b>operations</b> and wood transport, which may cause soil structure degradation.

This study was conducted using undisturbed soil samples collected at the 0. 1 - 0. 125 m depth. Undisturbed soil samples were used in the uniaxial compression tests. Soil sampling consisted of two stages, before and after the mechanized <b>harvest</b> <b>operations.</b> The traffic effects on the sigmap in the dry season indicated that the soil compaction process was neither evident nor important. However, in the rainy season the traffic effects on the sigmap indicated that the operations performed with Harvester and Forwarder caused greater soil compaction than those with Motorized Saw and Manual, which caused less soil compaction...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to determine, {{through the use of}} the bearing capacity model, the traffic effects of the forest <b>harvest</b> <b>operations</b> on the preconsolidation pressure (p), during one cycle of the eucalyptus plantation. The work was conducted using undisturbed soil samples, collected at the surface of the A horizon and {{in the top of the}} B horizon of an Udult (PA), Aquox (FX) and Udox (LA) soils. The undisturbed soil samples were used in the uniaxial compression tests. The soil sampling was done before and after the <b>harvest</b> <b>operations.</b> The operations performed with the Forwarder caused greater soil compaction than the ones done with the Feller Büncher and Harvester. The percentage of soil samples, in the region with additional soil compaction, indicated that the Udult was the soil class more susceptible to soil compaction, followed by the Aquox and Udox. Despite Udult is the more susceptible to soil compaction, the regeneration of the soil structure in this soil class was more efficient than in Aquox.

40|$|Landings are an {{integral}} part of New Zealand <b>Harvest</b> <b>operations</b> where extracted trees are processed into logs and loaded out onto trucks. Forest owners need to balance the cost and environmental considerations when designing and constructing landings, with the productivity and safety of the harvesting crew that will use the landing. The objective of this study is to gain a greater understanding of landing size and how they affect forest <b>harvest</b> <b>operations.</b> This study investigates the relationship between landing size and processing delays. A time study was carried out for ten <b>harvest</b> <b>operations</b> predominantly in the lower North Island. The time study recorded all delays on the processing task of measuring and cutting stems into logs. The delays were then categorised so that only processing delays that are influenced by the size of the landing remained. These processing delays were then expressed per m 3 and used as the response variable in regression analysis to test their correlation against landing size and a range of other predictor variables. A very strong, linear relationship between processing delays per m 3 and actual landing size was found. This indicates that <b>harvest</b> <b>operations</b> on smaller landings exhibited higher delays per m 3 than those on larger landings. Loading of the deck was the most significant processing delay; this is a direct result of not having enough room for surge piles as delimbing was not able to be carried out during loader downtime. The significance of the relationships developed in this study can help forest owners realise the implications of building landings that are too small for the intended purpose.
