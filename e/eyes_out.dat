5|$|Several {{women in}} Carnivàle {{are tied to}} Avatars, but only two have Avataric blood: Belyakov's {{daughter}} Iris is a Vectorus by definition, and Justin's daughter Sofie is the Omega. Although Sofie is {{two years older than}} Ben, her father's Avataric generation places her in the next Avataric generation. The other affected women are human mothers who began to suffer from mental illness or strange behavior after giving birth to an Avatar. Ben's mother Flora was a religious fanatic who would not touch her son. Scudder's mother Emma cut her <b>eyes</b> <b>out</b> and killed several of her family members the night Scudder was born. Sofie's mother Apollonia became catatonic after Sofie's birth. Justin's and his older sister Iris's mother receives no special mention in the series, but the Pitch Document mentions her chronic paranoid schizophrenia after Justin's birth. As far as known, none of these mothers became pregnant after giving birth to an Avatar.|$|E
5|$|Andrei and Daniil {{are working}} on the {{decoration}} of a church in Vladimir. Although they have been there for several months the walls are still white and bare as Andrei is doubting himself. A messenger arrives with word from the furious Bishop to say they have until the Autumn to finish the job. On a nearby road {{in the middle of a}} field of flowers Andrei confides to Daniil that the task disgusts him and that he is unable to paint a subject such as the Last Judgement as he doesn’t want to terrify people into submission. He comes to the conclusion that he has lost the ease of mind that an artist needs for his work. Foma, impatient and ambitious, resigns and leaves Andrei's group to take up the offer of painting a smaller, less prestigious, church. Stone carvers and decorators of Andrei's party have also been working on the Grand Prince's mansion. The Prince wants the work to be done again more in line with his tastes but the workers already have another job, at the mansion of the Grand Prince's brother, and refuse. On a path through the woods soldiers accost the artisans on the orders of the Grand Prince and gouge their <b>eyes</b> <b>out,</b> so that they cannot replicate their work. Back at the church Andrei is dismayed by the news of their fate and angrily throws paint and smears it on one of the walls. Sergei (Vladimir Titov) one of the young apprentices who escaped the attack unharmed reads a random section of the bible aloud, at Daniil's request, concerning women. Durochka (Irma Raush) (whose name identifies her as a holy fool or Yurodivy), wanders in out of the rain and is upset by the sight of the paint on the wall. Her feeble-mindedness and innocence leads Andrei to the idea to paint a feast.|$|E
25|$|When Brian went overseas, Matthew (now codenamed Gabriel) {{convinced}} Betsy {{to become}} the new Captain Britain, wearing Kaptain Briton's modified costume. Working with Captain UK, the duo became public sensations. After several months, crime boss Vixen lured Betsy into a showdown with Slaymaster, who brutally beat her, then gouged her <b>eyes</b> <b>out.</b> Brian flew to her rescue and killed Slaymaster. Betsy refused R.C.X.'s offer of cybernetic eyes, preferring to rely on her psychic abilities; she and Gabriel went to Switzerland for Betsy to recuperate.|$|E

25|$|Lamia was a {{queen of}} Libya, whom Zeus loved. Hera turned {{her into a}} monster and murdered their {{children}}. Or, alternatively, she killed Lamia's children and the grief turned her into a monster. Lamia was cursed with the inability to close her eyes {{so that she would}} always obsess over the image of her dead children. Zeus gave her the gift {{to be able to take}} her <b>eyes</b> <b>out</b> to rest, and then put them back in. Lamia was envious of other mothers and ate their children.|$|E

She sends wild crows to peck their <b>eyes</b> <b>out,</b> but the Scarecrow kills them by breaking their necks. She summons a swarm of black bees to sting them, but they are killed trying to sting the Tin Woodman while the Scarecrow's straw hides the other three. She sends her Winkie soldiers to attack them, but the Cowardly Lion stands firm to repel them. Finally, she uses {{the power of the}} Golden Cap to send the winged monkeys to capture Dorothy, Toto, and the Cowardly Lion, unstuff the Scarecrow, and dent the Tin Woodman. Dorothy is forced to become the Wicked Witch's personal slave, while the witch schemes to steal Dorothy's Silver Shoes.|$|E

500|$|The HIV storyline {{came to an}} end {{on-screen}} in 2003, when {{executive producer}} Louise Berridge decided to axe Mark Fowler. In the serial, Mark discovers his HIV medication is failing, but instead of allowing Pauline to witness his deterioration, he leaves to spend the remainder of his life travelling. Richard has classed Mark's exit as her most difficult storyline, commenting: [...] "I was so genuinely upset that Todd Carty, who played Mark, was going I could barely get my lines out for want of crying—but everybody said I acted it well. It was, I think, ten per cent acting and 90 per cent me crying my <b>eyes</b> <b>out</b> because I was being selfish and didn't want Todd to go." [...] Mark, who had appeared intermittently for 18 years, was eventually killed off-screen in 2004, dying of an AIDS-related illness.|$|E
500|$|On 13 April 1962, Kirchherr met {{the group}} at Hamburg Airport, telling them that Sutcliffe had died a few days before. Sutcliffe's mother flew to Hamburg with the Beatles' manager Brian Epstein, and {{returned}} to Liverpool with her son's body. Sutcliffe's father did not hear of his son's death for three weeks, as he was sailing to South America, although the family arranged for a padre to tell him when he docked in Buenos Aires. After Sutcliffe's death, Kirchherr {{wrote a letter to}} his mother, apologising for being too ill to attend his funeral in Liverpool and saying how much she and Lennon missed him: [...] "Oh, Mum, he (Lennon) is in a terrible mood now, he just can't believe that darling Stuart never comes back.

500|$|Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Abby West {{focused on}} Carell's acting, {{explaining}} that [...] "the way that Michael's desire to boast and his healthy fear of offending Jan {{played out on}} Steve Carell's face was fantastic. From his braggadocio {{on the phone with}} Todd Packer (Packer!) to his death march up the stairs to face Jan, it was a thing of beauty." [...] BuddyTV's Oscar Dahl believed that [...] "Back from Vacation" [...] was [...] "one of the two or three best of the season", opining that [...] "simplicity" [...] was the key to the series' success. Dahl continued, [...] "Each episode's premise can be entirely mundane and inconsequential. It will still mine laughs from the situation at hand. We also had some nice development in the Jim-Pam-Karen triangle, with Pam giving Jim relationship advice, then bawling her <b>eyes</b> <b>out</b> afterwards. Maybe the best scene in the episode saw Dwight comfort her." [...] Television Without Pity graded the episode with an A.|$|E
500|$|In May 1894, Courtenay {{followed}} Lloyd to the Empire, Leicester Square, {{where she}} was performing, and attempted to batter her with a stick, shouting: [...] "I will gouge your <b>eyes</b> <b>out</b> and ruin you!" [...] His assault missed Lloyd, but struck Burge in the face instead. [...] As {{a result of the}} incident, Lloyd was sacked from the Empire for fear of a reprisal. Lloyd left the marital home, moving to 73 Carleton Road, Tufnell Park and successfully applied for a restraining warrant, which prevented Courtenay from contacting her. [...] A few weeks later, Lloyd began an affair with the music hall singer Alec Hurley, which resulted in Courtenay initiating divorce proceedings in 1894 on the grounds of her adultery. That year, together with a short tour of the English provinces, Lloyd travelled to New York with Hurley, where she appeared at the Imperial Theatre, staying for two months. On her return to England, she appeared in the Liverpool Christmas pantomime as the principal boy in Pretty Bo-Peep, Little Boy Blue, and the Merry Old Woman who lived in a Shoe. [...] Her performance was praised by the press, who called her [...] "delightfully easy, graceful and self-possessed." ...|$|E
500|$|William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet {{inspired}} the lyrics for [...] "Exit Music (For a Film)". Initially Yorke {{wanted to work}} lines from the play into the song, but the final draft of the lyrics became a broad summary of the narrative. He said: [...] "I saw the Zeffirelli version when I was 13 and I cried my <b>eyes</b> <b>out,</b> because I couldn't understand why, the morning after they shagged, they didn't just run away. It's a song for two people who should run away before all the bad stuff starts." [...] Yorke compared {{the opening of the}} song, which mostly features his singing paired with acoustic guitar, to Johnny Cash's At Folsom Prison. Mellotron choir and other electronic voices are used throughout the track. The song climaxes with the entrance of drums and distorted bass run through a fuzz pedal. The climactic portion of the song is an attempt to emulate the sound of trip hop group Portishead, but in a style that bass player Colin Greenwood called more [...] "stilted and leaden and mechanical". The song concludes by fading back to Yorke's voice, acoustic guitar and Mellotron.|$|E

500|$|Ferret-legging {{has existed}} for centuries, but the sport made a brief {{resurgence}} in popularity during the 1970s. According to a 2005 report published in the English Northern Echo newspaper, whether due to a [...] "lack of brave contestants or complaining wives", ferret-legging is now [...] "a dying sport" [...] that is being replaced by ferret racing, in which the animals race through a plastic pipe. Although the sport is now uncommon, annual competitions were held at the Richmond Highland Games & Celtic Festival in Richmond, Virginia from 2003 through 2009. In 2007 the Manitoba Ferret Association held a ferret-legging competition in St. Vital Park, Winnipeg, to raise money {{in support of the}} organization's shelter for homeless ferrets. Marlene Blackburn, who works with the Ferret Rescue League to ensure that no ferrets are harmed in the sport, claims that during the years the competitions have been held in Richmond no contestant has ever been bitten, although some may get a few scratches. According to Kelly Yager of the Manitoba Ferret Association, the animals actually like small, confined spaces. Jay Lugar, spokesman for the Richmond Highland Games & Celtic Festival, said ferrets are [...] "generally very harmless, fun-loving creatures." [...] Reg Mellor, however, commented that at their very worst, they can be [...] "cannibals, things that live only to kill, that'll eat your <b>eyes</b> <b>out</b> to get at your brain".|$|E
500|$|The {{other boys}} carry out equally barbaric acts: {{the two boys}} {{at the top of}} the steps are burning the <b>eyes</b> <b>out</b> of a bird with a hot needle heated by the link-boy's torch; the boys in the {{foreground}} are throwing at a cock (perhaps an allusion to a nationalistic enmity towards the French, and a suggestion that the action takes place on Shrove Tuesday, the traditional day for cock-shying); another boy ties a bone to a dog's tail—tempting, but out of reach; a pair of fighting cats are hung by their tails and taunted by a jeering group of boys; in the bottom left-hand corner a dog is set on a cat; and in the rear of the picture another cat tied to two [...] is thrown from a high window. In a foreshadowing of his ultimate fate, Tom Nero's name is written under the chalk drawing of a man hanging from the gallows; the meaning is made clear by the schoolboy artist pointing towards Tom. The absence of parish officers who should be controlling the boys is an intentional rebuke on Hogarth's part; he agreed with Henry Fielding that one of the causes for the rising crime rate was the lack of care from the overseers of the poor, who were too often interested in the posts only for the social status and monetary rewards they could bring.|$|E
500|$|After she {{accepted}} the role, Richard {{was told by}} Julia Smith {{that she would have}} to change her appearance, to make it more in keeping with Pauline's unglamorous lifestyle. This included having her hair cut. Richard has commented, [...] "I was very proud of my long hair, which had taken me years to grow. I hadn't had it cut short for nineteen years but reluctantly, I agreed... I cried my <b>eyes</b> <b>out</b> for the rest of the day after that traumatic hair cut." [...] From September 1984, Richard was involved in pre-production of the series, covering every angle, from hair, costume design and make-up to organising the set interior of her character's screen house. Richard has said that Pauline had been given extensive biographical detail, including minute specifics, such as her fictional time of her birth: [...] "It was vital that we should get to know our own characters intimately and so the cast initially sat together in family groups to learn our lines and bond with our 'relations'... it was essential to develop the rapport that families, who'd been together for years, would naturally have." [...] Richard's casting was considered to be [...] "a giant leap of faith" [...] by co-creators Holland and Smith, but one that ultimately [...] "landed on its feet", because Pauline went on to be one of the longest running characters in EastEnders history, remaining with the show for nearly twenty-two years.|$|E

500|$|Allmusic's MacKenzie Wilson {{wrote that}} Maybe This Christmas Too? {{would appeal to}} [...] "both casual and die-hard music fans of all ages". Wilson called Wainwright's {{performance}} [...] "classic chamber pop with a warm spirit" [...] and also noted the [...] "fetching" [...] graphic design work for the album's cover art by Brian [...] "Goatpillow" [...] Brooks of Cosmic Debris. Andrew Gilstrap's review for PopMatters also complimented [...] "Spotlight on Christmas", calling the song a [...] "clever piece of class-conscious commentary" [...] that provides a [...] "perfect example of [...] meticulous toyshop brand of pop." [...] Simmy Richman of The Independent considered The Flaming Lips' rendition of [...] "White Christmas" [...] to be the [...] "strangest" [...] he had ever heard. Gilstrap used the same adjective ("strange") to describe [...] "O Holy Night", and thought [...] "Silent Night" [...] was [...] "incredibly potent" [...] despite its short length. The New York Times Kelefa Sanneh called [...] "White Christmas" [...] "spooky" [...] and wrote that the album [...] "brings to the world something more ambivalent than joy". Gilbert concluded that Maybe This Christmas Too? [...] "feels just about right" [...] and [...] "does a fine job of representing the less than stellar aspects of a wintry, commercialized holiday like Christmas." [...] In 2008 The A.V. Club included [...] "Spotlight on Christmas" [...] as number thirty-nine on its list of [...] "42 holiday entertainments that don't make us want to claw our <b>eyes</b> <b>out</b> with rage".|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the sound of}} their studio recordings, Joy Division typically played loudly and aggressively during live performances. The band were unhappy with Hannett's mixing of Unknown Pleasures, which reduced the abrasiveness of their sound. According to Sumner, [...] "the music was loud and heavy, and we felt that Martin had toned it down, especially with the guitars". In concert, the group interacted little with the crowd; Paul Morley wrote, [...] "During a Joy Division set, outside of the songs, you'll be lucky to hear {{more than two or three}} words. Hello and goodbye. No introductions, no promotion". While singing, Curtis would often perform what was referred to as his [...] "'dead fly' dance", where the singer's arms would [...] "start flying in [...] semicircular, hypnotic curve". Simon Reynolds noted that Curtis's dancing style was reminiscent of an epileptic fit, and that he was dancing in the manner for some months before he was diagnosed with epilepsy. Live performances became problematic for Joy Division, due to Curtis's condition. Sumner later said, [...] "We didn't have flashing lights, but sometimes a particular drum beat would do something to him. He'd go off in a trance for a bit, then he'd lose it and have an epileptic fit. We'd have to stop the show and carry him off to the dressing-room where he'd cry his <b>eyes</b> <b>out</b> because this appalling thing had just happened to him".|$|E
500|$|Latifah Muhammad {{from the}} BET called the ballad a [...] "field of {{emotional}} land mines, which is fitting given the subject matter". The A.V. Club writer Evan Rytlewski {{wrote that the}} singer managed to convey [...] "real, unfettered pain" [...] on the [...] "crushing tribute" [...] to her miscarried baby. Korina Lopez from USA Today called the ballad [...] "sweet" [...] and one that offers a [...] "peek into her family life". Mesfin Fekadu from the Associated Press noted the song to be more honest than Beyoncé's previous work. Mike Wass of Idolator named the [...] "fragile ballad" [...] as a [...] "heartbreaking letter" [...] and his personal favorite on the album. He noted how it may never be disclosed whether the song was inspired by Beyoncé's personal loss, before adding that [...] "if so, it couldn't be a more beautiful tribute". Anupa Mistry from Spin found a [...] "moving story of a miscarriage" [...] in the track. Tom Breihan from the website Stereogum lauded Beyoncé's decision to record a song about the important subject of miscarriage, calling it [...] "an incredibly brave and real act" [...] and noting how it acted as a [...] "hug" [...] to people with similar experiences. He concluded that [...] "eople are going to cry their <b>eyes</b> <b>out</b> to this" [...] before naming [...] "Heaven" [...] and [...] "Blue" [...] "maybe the realest, most grown-up things Beyoncé has ever done".|$|E
