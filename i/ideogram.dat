25|$|The ideograms are symbols, not {{pictures}} of the objects in question—e.g. one tablet records a tripod with missing legs, but the <b>ideogram</b> used is of a tripod with three legs. In modern transcriptions of Linear B tablets, it is typically convenient to represent an <b>ideogram</b> by its Latin or English name or by an abbreviation of the Latin name. Ventris and Chadwick generally used English; Bennett, Latin. Neither the English nor the Latin can be relied upon as an accurate name of the object; in fact, the identification {{of some of the}} more obscure objects is a matter of exegesis.|$|E

40|$|<b>Ideograms</b> (symbols that {{represent}} {{a word or}} idea) have great communicative value. They refer to concepts in a simple manner, easing the understanding of related ideas. Moreover, <b>ideograms</b> can simplify the often cumbersome notation used {{in the fields of}} Physics and physical Chemistry. Nonetheless only a few specific <b>ideograms</b> for these fields have been defined to date. In this work we propose that the scientific community follows the example of Mathematics -as well as that of oriental languages- and bestows a more important role upon <b>ideograms.</b> To support this thesis we propose <b>ideograms</b> for essential concepts in Physics and Chemistry. They are designed to be intuitive, and their goal is to make equations easier to read and understand. Our symbols are included in a publicly available Latex package (svrsymbols).

25|$|In general, {{the range}} of {{possibilities}} is first narrowed down (often by entering the desired character's pronunciation). Then, if there remains more than one possibility, the desired <b>ideogram</b> is selected, either by typing the number before the character, or using a graphical menu to select it. The computer assists the typist by using heuristics to guess which character is most likely desired. Although this may seem painstaking, East Asian input methods are today sufficient in that, even for beginners, typing in these languages is only slightly slower than typing English.|$|E
25|$|The Plumed Serpent, an <b>ideogram</b> of {{the metaphor}} of Quetzalcoatl, alludes {{to one of the}} most {{powerful}} forces of nature. A Said metaphor is recorded in the Nahuatl language:Quetzalcoatl: he was the wind; he was the guide, the road sweeper of the rain gods, of the masters of the water, of those who Brough rain. And when the wind increased, it was said, the dust swirled up, it roared, howled, became dark, blew in all directions; there was lightning; it grew wrathful.The metaphor served to not only describe a powerful seasonal phenomenon, but was also the title of rulership and priestly office; additionally, the name figured in Toltec ties as a military title and emblem.|$|E
25|$|It {{is thought}} that the first true {{alphabetic}} writing was developed around 2000 BC for Semitic workers in the Sinai by giving mostly Egyptian hieratic glyphs Semitic values (see History of the alphabet and Proto-Sinaitic alphabet). The Ge'ez writing system of Ethiopia is considered Semitic. It {{is likely to be}} of semi-independent origin, having roots in the Meroitic Sudanese <b>ideogram</b> system. Most other alphabets in the world today either descended from this one innovation, many via the Phoenician alphabet, or were directly inspired by its design. In Italy, about 500 years passed from the early Old Italic alphabet to Plautus (750 to 250 BC), {{and in the case of}} the Germanic peoples, the corresponding time span is again similar, from the first Elder Futhark inscriptions to early texts like the Abrogans (c. AD 200 to 750).|$|E
5000|$|Because {{some ideas}} are universal, many {{different}} cultures developed similar <b>ideograms.</b> For example, an eye with a tear means 'sadness' in Native American <b>ideograms</b> in California, {{as it does}} for the Aztecs, the early Chinese and the Egyptians.|$|R

2500|$|That khwarrah – in {{addition}} to its significance as [...] "royal fortune" [...] – also signified [...] "fortune" [...] in a general sense is demonstrated by the use of an Aramaic <b>ideogram</b> GDE in the Middle Persian texts of the Sassanid and post-Sassanid periods.

2500|$|Visually, hieroglyphs are all {{more or less}} figurative: they {{represent}} real or illusional elements, sometimes stylized and simplified, but all generally perfectly recognizable in form. However, the same sign can, according to context, be interpreted in diverse ways: as a phonogram (phonetic reading), as a logogram, or as an <b>ideogram</b> (semagram; [...] "determinative") (semantic reading). The determinative was not read as a phonetic constituent, but facilitated understanding by differentiating the word from its homophones.|$|E

2500|$|A {{large part}} of the claims are clearly pseudoscientific, if not {{bordering}} on the esoteric.

He was originally patron {{god of the}} city of Eridu, but later the influence of his cult spread throughout Mesopotamia and to the Canaanites, Hittites and Hurrians. He was associated with the southern band of constellations called stars of Ea, but also with the constellation AŠ-IKU, the Field (Square of Pegasus). Beginning around the second millennium BCE, he was sometimes referred to in writing by the numeric <b>ideogram</b> for [...] "40," [...] occasionally referred to as his [...] "sacred number."

2500|$|A near {{complete}} pack of Mamluk {{playing cards}} {{dating to the}} 15th century and of similar appearance to the fragments above was discovered by Leo Aryeh Mayer in the Topkapı Palace, Istanbul, in 1939. It is not a complete set and is actually composed of three different packs, probably to replace missing cards. [...] The Topkapı pack originally contained 52 cards comprising four suits: polo-sticks, coins, swords, and cups. Each suit contained ten pip cards and three court cards, called malik (king), nā'ib malik (viceroy or deputy king), and thānī nā'ib (second or under-deputy). The thānī nā'ib is a non-existent title so {{it may not have}} been in the earliest versions; without this rank, the Mamluk suits would structurally be the same as a Ganjifa suit. In fact, the word [...] "Kanjifah" [...] appears in Arabic on the king of swords and is still used in parts of the Middle East to describe modern playing cards. Influence from further east can explain why the Mamluks, most of whom were Central Asian Turkic Kipchaks, called their cups tuman which means myriad in Turkic, Mongolian and Jurchen languages. Wilkinson postulated that the cups may have been derived from inverting the Chinese and Jurchen <b>ideogram</b> for myriad (...) [...]|$|E
2500|$|The Sumerians {{are said}} to have {{cultivated}} and harvested the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) in lower Mesopotamia as early as 3400 BCE, though this has been disputed. The most ancient testimony concerning the opium poppy found to date was inscribed in cuneiform script on a small white clay tablet {{at the end of the}} third millennium BCE. This tablet was discovered in 1954 during excavations at Nippur, and is currently kept at the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. Deciphered by Samuel Noah Kramer and Martin Leve, it is considered to be the most ancient pharmacopoeia in existence. Some Sumerian tablets of this era have an <b>ideogram</b> inscribed upon them, [...] "hul gil", which translates to [...] "plant of joy", believed by some authors to refer to opium. The term gil is still used for opium in certain parts of the world. The Sumerian goddess Nidaba is often depicted with poppies growing out of her shoulders. About 2225 BCE, the Sumerian territory became a part of the Babylonian empire. Knowledge and use of the opium poppy and its euphoric effects thus passed to the Babylonians, who expanded their empire eastwards to Persia and westwards to Egypt, thereby extending its range to these civilizations. British archaeologist and cuneiformist Reginald Campbell Thompson writes that opium was known to the Assyrians in the 7th century BCE. The term [...] "Arat Pa Pa" [...] occurs in the Assyrian Herbal, a collection of inscribed Assyrian tablets dated to c. 650 BCE. According to Thompson, this term is the Assyrian name for the juice of the poppy and it may be the etymological origin of the Latin [...] "papaver".|$|E
