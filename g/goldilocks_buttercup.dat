These have spread from the adjacent woodland, or survived from the cemetery's prior existence as Horseshoe Farm.|$|E

50|$|Ranunculus auricomus, {{known as}} <b>goldilocks</b> <b>buttercup</b> or Greenland buttercup, is a {{perennial}} species of buttercup native to Eurasia. It is a calcicole typically found in moist woods {{and at the}} margins of woods. It is apomictic, and several hundred agamospecies have been recognised.|$|E
50|$|In the near-natural {{riparian}} woods, ash and alder trees abound. In spring {{yellow wood}} anemone, bulbous corydalis and lesser celandine blossom in the woods. Opposite-leaved golden saxifrage and primrose grow on the wetter tracts {{of the nature}} reserve. There are also marsh marigold meadows which are also graced by flowers such as the western marsh orchid, water avens and <b>goldilocks</b> <b>buttercup.</b>|$|E
50|$|The site is {{a linear}} park {{along the banks of}} the Bonesgate Stream between Chessington Road and Filby Road. It adjoins Castle Hill LNR to the south and Hogsmill LNR (in Epsom and Ewell) to the north. It is mainly {{grassland}} with some coppiced hazel, which has the locally rare <b>goldilocks</b> <b>buttercup.</b> Birds include the great spotted woodpecker, song thrush and lesser whitethroat.|$|E
50|$|The site is {{a mixture}} of woodland, scrub and {{grassland}} on a south facing chalk slope. Some of the beech woodland dates back 400 years, and there is younger cherry, holly, yew and ash. Ground plants include wood spurge and <b>goldilocks</b> <b>buttercup,</b> and there are mammals such as roe deer and hazel dormice. There is a wide variety of fungi.|$|E
50|$|As {{with many}} farms in England Sheepdrove {{has entered the}} Defra {{agri-environment}} schemes to help support farmland biodiversity including special measures to restore habitats such as Sheepdrove Rare Butterfly Project which aims to attract marsh fritillaries. The farm has records of 25 species of butterfly, 10 species of bee, 6 species of bat and 104 species of bird (including 5 types of owl). Notable plants include the <b>goldilocks</b> <b>buttercup,</b> field gromwell and Venus's looking-glass.|$|E
50|$|The ground flora is {{particularly}} rich given {{its proximity to}} central London (the wood is within a six-mile radius of Charing Cross railway station). It includes a large population of wood anemone, <b>goldilocks</b> <b>buttercup</b> and wood sorrel, yellow pimpernel and square-stemmed St John's wort. A survey conducted in 1984 noted 39 distinct herbaceous species and 15 different grasses native to the wood, in addition to some 23 species of tree and shrub.|$|E
50|$|Other {{woodland}} species {{found in}} Grass Wood include Wild Strawberry (Fragaria vesca), Red Campion (Silene dioica), Wood Cranesbill (Geranium sylvaticum), Primrose (Primula vulgaris), Bugle (Ajuga reptans), St John's wort (Hypericum hirsutum), {{and a few}} Columbine (Aquilegia vulgaris) are found at woodland edges. There are scarce clumps of Stinking iris (Iris foetidissima) and of Stinking Hellebore (Helleborus foetidus). The grassland species of Lady's-mantle (Alchemilla glabra), Great Burnet (Sanguisorba officinalis), Melancholy Thistle (Cirsium helenioides) and <b>Goldilocks</b> <b>Buttercup</b> (Ranunculus auricomus) are found in clearings.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the park}} {{does not have}} the vast marshes and lakes {{characteristic}} {{of the rest of the}} region, water is nevertheless present everywhere. The humid zones are rich with a great diversity of flora and fauna. The stratification of vegetation is just as valid in the humid zones. In the montane region, the humid soils are covered with flowers such as the northern Labrador tea, cottonsedge, the <b>Goldilocks</b> <b>buttercup,</b> St Olaf's candlestick, common selfheal and common marsh-bedstraw. In the subalpine zone, the humid prairies mainly have mats of Globe-flower, kingcup and twoflower violet. In the alpine region there are many subalpine plants as well as the Pedicularis sceptrum-carolinum, and the vegetation decreases as the altitude increases.|$|E
