40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a new and}} original algorithm for optical <b>flow</b> <b>detection.</b> It {{is based on an}} iterative search for a displacement field that minimizes the L 1 or L 2 distance between two images. Both images are sliced into parallel and overlapping strips. Corresponding strips are aligned using dynamic programming exactly as 2 D representations of speech signal are with the DTW algorithm. Two passes are performed using orthogonal slicing directions. This process is iterated in a pyramidal fashion by reducing the spacing and width of the strips. This algorithm provides a very high quality matching for calibrated patterns as well as for human visual sensation. The results appears to be at least as good as those obtained with classical optical <b>flow</b> <b>detection</b> methods. 1.

40|$|Crowd {{counting}} {{which aims}} at obtaining {{the number of}} people within a scene is an important computer vision task. While most previous methods try to count people within one frame, this paper addresses this problem using the <b>detection</b> <b>flow</b> which is defined as a set of object detection responses along the temporal video sequence. We argue that counting based on <b>detection</b> <b>flow</b> provides a better way to estimate the crowd size with following merits: 1) it can greatly alleviate the common weakness of an object detector including miss detection and false alarms; 2) it is robust to temporal object occlusions and noises; 3) it is more competent to give specific descriptions of the crowd, e. g. crowd moving directions and target locations.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a literature review on data <b>flow</b> error <b>detection</b> and recovery techniques in embedded systems. In recent years, embedded systems {{are being used}} {{more and more in}} an enormous number of applications from small mobile device to big medical devices. At the same time, it is becoming important for embedded developers to make embedded systems fault-tolerant. To make embedded systems fault-tolerant, error detection and recovery mechanisms are effective techniques to take into consideration. Fault tolerance can be achieved by using both hardware and software techniques.
