25|$|Located {{previously}} in the crypt, {{where it was}} touched in the evening by the setting sun, was the Grave of the Unknown Soldier, a realistic depiction of a dead soldier sculpted by George Washington Lambert. Although previously visible to the public from above, the tomb has now been moved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> of the cathedral, to give the public greater access to it.|$|E
25|$|As such a {{large number}} of cups are needed, {{gathering}} normally occurs in large groups of people. The cups are simply stacked within each other until they form a tube or 'snake'. Once the snake has reached the desired length it is held skyward to 'dance' as if being charmed. Snake length is often restricted by the width of the bay of seats as anything longer will protrude <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle.</b> One solution to this is to team up with other groups and link your snakes together. One of the biggest challenges is trying to keep it in one piece.|$|E
25|$|The {{main event}} was a WWF Championship match between Dude Love and the champion, Stone Cold Steve Austin, with Vince McMahon as the special guest referee. The two wrestlers fought {{back and forth}} into the {{beginning}} of the match, and took the fight to ringside, where Pat Patterson announced that the match would be contested under No Disqualification rules. The two wrestlers continue to brawl at ringside, where they took the fight <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle,</b> where Patterson then announced that the match would be contested under Falls Count Anywhere rules, where afterwards Austin and Love continued to brawl all over the arena. As the fight returned to the ring, Patterson handed Love a steel chair, which Love and Austin used to attack each other, however, Dude Love accidentally hit McMahon with the steel chair. Austin then delivered a Stone Cold Stunner on Love, and a second referee attempted to count Austin's pin attempt. Patterson attacked the second referee, however, allowing Love to perform the Mandible claw on Austin. Both Patterson and Gerald Brisco attempted to count the pinfall, but The Undertaker, who was at ringside, chokeslammed them both through the announcer's tables. Austin then miraculously delivered another Stone Cold Stunner on Love, which proceeded to Austin dragging McMahon to where Austin would pin Love, by using McMahon's hand to count the pinfall.|$|E
50|$|In 2003, {{while the}} books were moved out of Condon to go to William H. Gates Hall, the librarians could not fit their library carts <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles.</b> <b>The</b> staff used a {{ferrying}} system to get books to range ends. The staff used a cart numbering system, removed books from shelves, and placed them in the carts.|$|R
50|$|The {{church has}} a nave and two aisles, {{separated}} by octagonal columns with Romanesque capitals and round columns with Baroque capitals. It ends in large apses, {{and has a}} series of chapels opening <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{production}} is a Broadway-type show. Many {{of the scenes}} and songs from the movie are re-created on stage {{and some of the}} action spills out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles,</b> such as Prince Ali's arrival in Agrabah on elephant back.|$|R
500|$|Presley's {{earliest}} musical influence {{came from}} gospel. His mother recalled {{that from the}} age of two, at the Assembly of God church in Tupelo attended by the family, [...] "he would slide down off my lap, run <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> and scramble up to the platform. There he would stand looking at the choir and trying to sing with them." [...] In Memphis, Presley frequently attended all-night gospel singings at the Ellis Auditorium, where groups such as the Statesmen Quartet led the music in a style that, Guralnick suggests, sowed the seeds of Presley's future stage act: ...|$|E
500|$|In 1943 the studio's film Casablanca won the Academy Award for Best Picture. When {{the award}} was announced, {{producer}} Hal B. Wallis {{got up to}} accept, only to find Jack Warner had rushed onstage [...] "with a broad, flashing smile and a look of great self-satisfaction" [...] to take the trophy, Wallis later recalled. [...] "I couldn't believe it was happening. Casablanca had been my creation; Jack {{had absolutely nothing to}} do with it. As the audience gasped, I tried to get out of the row of seats and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle,</b> but the entire Warner family sat blocking me. I had no alternative but to sit down again, humiliated and furious.... Almost forty years later, I still haven't recovered from the shock." ...|$|E
500|$|On January 31, 2010, Pink {{performed}} the song at the 52nd Grammy Awards {{in a similar}} fashion. She began the performance walking out in a white silk robe, {{standing in front of}} a backdrop of electric blue screens. She descenced <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> and took off the robe to reveal the bodysuit. After being lifted from the tank of water, Pink kept twirling and spreading water into all directions, before finally descending to the main stage. The audience greeted her with a standing ovation. The performance was deemed by various media outlets as the best of the ceremony. Glenn Gamboa of Newsday commented, [...] "With her stunning Grammy performance of 'Glitter in the Air,' Pink proved that you don’t have to be shocking or over-the-top to be the best or the most-talked-about. You just have to be amazing." [...] It was also voted on a readers' poll in MTV.com as the best performance of the night. Staff reporter Kyle Anderson said [...] "It's easy to see why, as her acrobatic performance of 'Glitter in the Air' was not only visually gorgeous, but also technically impressive — she was able to keep singing even as she was spinning around in the air". Pink later explained she had almost fallen during the song, saying, [...] "When I do it on tour, I don't have lights above me. There were lights above me, so it almost went into a strobe thing, and I actually did get a little turned around. I thought... I was going to fall on my nude butt. But I worked it out." [...] In 2013, Brad Wete for Billboard ranked the performance as the best performance at the Grammy Awards from 2000 to 2012, commenting it [...] "graceful, show-stopping performance of aerial, acrobatic and vocal brilliance." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "A {{source of}} wonder and delirious delight...one {{of the funniest}} plays of its kind... {{had it not been}} for the {{inhibiting}} restraints of the theatre mystique for the preservation of its dignity, I would have been overtaken by convulsions, propelled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles,</b> a happy, helpless invalid of intemperate laughter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If Reuben Camp or the head-waiter don't {{bring back}} some of those tickets, I don't know what I shall do. I shall have to put chairs <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> and charge five dollars apiece for {{as many people as}} I can crowd in there. I never knew {{anything}} so perfectly providential." ...|$|R
6000|$|A dozen {{members were}} on their feet {{shouting}} to the chair. One was recognized, and that man Wetherell perceived with amazement to be Mr. Jameson of Wantage, adherent of Jethro's--he who had moved to adjourn for [...] "Uncle Tom's Cabin"! A score of members crowded <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles,</b> but <b>the</b> Speaker's voice again rose above the tumult.|$|R
2500|$|All bicycle rack-equipped {{cars have}} a yellow [...] "Bike Car" [...] sign posted by the door. Cyclists are {{required}} to tie their bicycle to the rack with the bungee cord provided, and must be racked so they do not protrude <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle.</b> Each rack can accommodate four bicycles. Because the bikes are stacked together against the racks, most riders place a destination tag, available from a conductor, on their bicycles to optimize placement and minimize shuffling.|$|E

50|$|The Lazarium {{consisted}} of the church (to {{the east of the}} site), the tomb of Lazarus (to the west), and an open space between the two which probably served as an atrium. The church was {{in the form of a}} three-aisle basilica. The apse, in a solid rectangular block shape, was at the east end. A sacristy on each side opened <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{congregation}} {{passed out}} from <b>the</b> choir <b>into</b> <b>the</b> nave through {{a sort of}} gateway in the screen beneath the organ, at the place marked O in the plan; and then, spreading out on each side, they passed between <b>the</b> columns <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles,</b> and thus moved slowly down the nave and <b>the</b> <b>aisles,</b> surveying <b>the</b> monuments and sculptures as they proceeded. They did not stop long at any place, but moved on continually, though slowly, {{as if it were}} not the custom to walk about much for the purpose of viewing the abbey on Sunday.|$|R
50|$|There is a {{fragment}} of a cross head built <b>into</b> <b>the</b> north <b>aisle</b> wall; it {{was found in the}} churchyard in 1881.|$|R

6000|$|The {{motion was}} put and carried amid laughter. As they dragged Bradley {{out of his}} chair and pushed him up the aisle, {{everybody}} laughed and cheered. William Councill kicked the Colonel as he went past and Robie hit him a sounding slap between the shoulders. The Colonel bore it all with astonishing good nature. As they reached the platform, young Mason stepped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> and shouted: ...|$|E
50|$|The murals {{here and}} in <b>the</b> south <b>aisle</b> {{represent}} <b>the</b> teaching of Jesus in the parables of the kingdom. The Stations of the Cross, also by Starmer, begin here and continue <b>into</b> <b>the</b> south <b>aisle.</b>|$|R
50|$|Visitors {{enter the}} church through <b>the</b> {{existing}} tower <b>into</b> a barrel vaulted nave. At the centre is a dome, supported on four Ionic columns, which is {{lit by a}} lantern above. The barrel vault extends <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> from <b>the</b> dome in a Greek-cross form, leaving four flat ceilings {{in the corners of}} the church. The church is well lit by plain glass windows in <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> and originally there was a large east window in the chancel, that is now covered by a reredos. The plasterwork ceiling is finely decorated, and the barrel vaults are lit by elliptical windows.|$|R
60|$|Heyst looked <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dim <b>aisles</b> of <b>the</b> forest. Everything was {{so still}} {{now that the}} very ground on which they stood seemed to exhale silence <b>into</b> <b>the</b> shade.|$|R
60|$|Before {{the boys}} came down again, she had settled {{the plan of}} {{operations}} with Henrietta and Mr. Franklin, dragged her holly bushes <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle,</b> and brought out her knife and string. They came down declaring {{that they could be}} of no use, and they should go away, and Beatrice made no objection to the departure of Carey and Johnny, who, as she justly observed, would be only in the way; but she insisted on keeping Fred and Alex.|$|E
6000|$|And {{then came}} another wonder. In the gallery {{overhead}} the sacks of flour were stacked in long rows. Perhaps a mouse {{had been at}} one of them; anyway the jar of the deep organ note shook down between the cracks of the gallery floor a stream of flour, covering Father Abram {{from head to foot}} with the white dust. And then the old miller stepped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle,</b> and waved his arms and began to sing the miller's song: ...|$|E
60|$|Hodder rose too. She had thrust herself {{past him}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle,</b> {{but if he}} had not taken her arm she would have fallen. Thus they went {{together}} {{to the door of the}} church, and out into the white, burning sunlight. In spite of her weakness she seemed actually to be leading him, impelled by a strange force and fled down the steps of the porch to the sidewalk. And there she paused, seeing him still beside her. Fortunately he had his hat in his hand.|$|E
50|$|The vestry lies to the {{northeast}} alongside the chancel. It runs <b>into</b> <b>the</b> north <b>aisle</b> which extends to the west end. Again the roof is of metal.|$|R
60|$|He {{found an}} end {{seat on a}} row at about {{the middle of the}} right-field bleachers and I chose one across <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> and {{somewhat}} behind him. No players were yet in sight. The stands were filling up and streams of men were filing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> of <b>the</b> bleachers and piling over the benches. Old Well-Well settled himself comfortably in his seat and gazed about him with animation. There had come a change to his massive features. The hard lines had softened; the patches of gray were no longer visible; his cheeks were ruddy; something akin to a smile shone on his face as he looked around, missing no detail of the familiar scene.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> south <b>aisle,</b> clerestory, nave roof, {{north and}} south porches, and north chancel chapel were added in the 15th century. A will of 1442 {{describes}} the north porch as [...] "new". The addition of <b>the</b> south <b>aisle</b> also saw <b>the</b> re-setting of the nave south wall doorway and windows <b>into</b> <b>the</b> new <b>aisle</b> wall.|$|R
60|$|The service proceeded, and the jealous {{father was}} {{quite sure that}} a mutual {{consciousness}} was uninterruptedly maintained between those two; he fancied that more than once their eyes met. At the end, Fitzpiers so timed his movement <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle</b> that it exactly coincided with Felice Charmond's from the opposite side, and they walked out with their garments in contact, the surgeon being just that two or three inches in her rear which made it convenient for his eyes to rest upon her cheek. The cheek warmed up to a richer tone.|$|E
6000|$|... 1. Sleeping in a Pullman car {{presents}} some difficulties to the novice. Care {{should be}} taken to allay all sense of danger. The frequent whistling of the engine during the night is apt {{to be a source of}} alarm. Find out, therefore, before travelling, the meaning of the various whistles. One means [...] "station," [...] two, [...] "railroad crossing," [...] and so on. Five whistles, short and rapid, mean sudden danger. When you hear whistles in the night, sit up smartly in your bunk and count them. Should they reach five, draw on your trousers over your pyjamas and leave the train instantly. As a further precaution against accident, sleep with the feet towards the engine if you prefer to have the feet crushed, or with the head towards the engine, if you think it best to have the head crushed. In making this decision try to be as unselfish as possible. If indifferent, sleep crosswise with the head hanging over <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle.</b>|$|E
60|$|They are parched and cramped, {{the lines}} of their hands filled with grime; they go to sleep curled in {{distorted}} attitudes, heads against the window-panes or propped on rolled coats on seat-arms, and legs thrust <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>aisle.</b> They do not read; apparently they do not think. They wait. An early-wrinkled, young-old mother, moving as though her joints were dry, opens a suit-case in which are seen creased blouses, a pair of slippers worn through at the toes, a bottle of patent medicine, a tin cup, a paper-covered book about dreams which the news-butcher has coaxed her into buying. She brings out a graham cracker which she feeds to a baby lying flat on a seat and wailing hopelessly. Most of the crumbs drop on the red plush of the seat, and the woman sighs and tries to brush them away, but they leap up impishly and fall back on the plush.|$|E
50|$|The chancel {{measures}} 42 ft by 20 ft. It has {{a narrow}} opening <b>into</b> <b>the</b> north <b>aisle.</b> Its arcades {{to the north}} and south have octagonal piers and three pointed arches of two chamfered orders. The Banastre chapel to the north, and the Barnside chapel to the south, are both separated from <b>the</b> <b>aisles</b> by oak screens.|$|R
50|$|The nave's {{ceiling is}} {{of wood and}} has carved hammerbeam trusses. <b>The</b> five-bay <b>aisle</b> arcades have moulded piers and two-centred arches. Between the steeple and <b>the</b> south <b>aisle</b> there is a {{chamfered}} arch. The vestry has in its western wall, an unglazed window that opens <b>into</b> <b>the</b> north <b>aisle.</b> It has a square head and original iron stanchions and saddle bars.|$|R
50|$|Street's {{restoration}} {{left the}} interior too dark so, in 1861, two new plain diamond windows {{were added to}} the south wall and in 1876 dormer windows, rarely seen in churches, were built <b>into</b> <b>the</b> south <b>aisle</b> roof.|$|R
