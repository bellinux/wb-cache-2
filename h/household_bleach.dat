25|$|Hand washing {{with soap}} and water is an {{effective}} method for reducing the transmission of norovirus pathogens. Alcohol rubs (≥62% ethanol) may be used as an adjunct, but are less effective than hand-washing, as norovirus lacks a lipid viral envelope. Surfaces where norovirus particles may be present can be sanitised with a solution of 1.5% to 7.5% of <b>household</b> <b>bleach</b> in water, or other disinfectants effective against norovirus.|$|E
50|$|Scouring {{agents are}} {{mixtures}} {{of the usual}} cleaning chemicials (surfactants, water softeners) as well as abrasive powders. The abrasive powder must be of a uniform particle size. Bleaching powders contain compounds that release sodium hypochlorite, the classical <b>household</b> <b>bleaching</b> agent. These precursor agents include trichloroisocyanuric acid and mixtures of sodium hypochlorite (“chlorinated orthophosphate”).|$|R

25|$|Solutions {{of ammonia}} (5–10% by weight) {{are used as}} {{household}} cleaners, particularly for glass. These solutions are irritating to the eyes and mucous membranes (respiratory and digestive tracts), {{and to a lesser}} extent the skin. Caution should be used that the chemical is never mixed into any liquid containing bleach, as a poisonous gas may result. Mixing with chlorine-containing products or strong oxidants, such as <b>household</b> <b>bleach,</b> can lead to hazardous compounds such as chloramines.|$|E
25|$|Examples of {{household}} products that contain or can contain H3PO4 are: cleaners for toilet bowls, grout, tile, automobile rims, some general-purpose cleaners/degreasers.

Additionally, never mix chemicals at home unless {{fully aware of the}} occurring chemical reaction, hazards, and safe-handling precautions necessary to remain safe. In example, the mixing of <b>household</b> <b>bleach</b> and phosphoric acid from a toilet bowl cleaner can cause the release of highly toxic chlorine gas.|$|E
25|$|After the American Civil War and emancipation, many African-Americans {{migrated}} to larger towns or cities, {{where they were}} influenced by new styles.

40|$|Abstract. We {{conducted}} a study to determine if use of a new flocculant-disinfectant home water treatment reduced diarrhea. We randomly assigned 492 rural Guatemalan households to five different water treatment groups: flocculant-disinfectant, flocculant-disinfectant plus a customized vessel, bleach, bleach plus a vessel, and control. During one year of observation, residents of control households had 4. 31 episodes of diarrhea per 100 person-weeks, whereas the incidence of diarrhea was 24 % lower among residents of households receiving flocculant-disinfectant, 29 % lower among those receiving flocculant-disinfectant plus vessel, 25 % lower among those receiving bleach, and 12 % lower among <b>households</b> receiving <b>bleach</b> plus vessel. In unannounced evaluations of home drinking water, free chlorine was detected in samples from 27 % of flocculant-disinfectant households, 35 % of flocculant-disinfectant plus vessel households, 35 % of <b>bleach</b> <b>households,</b> and 43 % of <b>bleach</b> plus vessel <b>households.</b> In a setting where diarrhea was {{a leading cause of}} death, intermittent use of home water treatment with flocculant-disinfectant decreased the incidence of diarrhea...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{introduced}} home {{drinking water}} disinfection and handwashing with soap in Karachi squatter settlements {{to evaluate their}} effect on diarrhea. In April 2000, 150 households received soap, 76 received dilute bleach and a water storage vessel, and 76 were enrolled as controls. In 2000, among households wealthy enough to own a refrigerator, children in <b>households</b> that received <b>bleach</b> and a vessel had a 73 % lower incidence of diarrhea than controls; those that received soap had a 56 % lower incidence. There was no reduction in diarrhea in intervention households without a refrigerator. In 2001, <b>households</b> that received <b>bleach</b> and a vessel had a 71 % lower incidence of diarrhea and children in households that received soap had a 35 % lower incidence than controls. In 2001, the interventions were equally effective in households that had a refrigerator and those that did not. Both of these home-based interventions were ultimately effective in preventing diarrhea, but only households of slightly higher socioeconomic status changed their behavior quickly enough to benefit during the first summer...|$|R
25|$|The nail {{is often}} {{considered}} an impermeable barrier, {{but this is}} not true. In fact, it is much more permeable than the skin, and the composition of the nail includes 7–12% water. This permeability has implications for penetration by harmful and medicinal substances; in particular cosmetics applied to the nails can pose a risk. Water can penetrate the nail as can many other substances including paraquat, a fast acting herbicide that is harmful to humans, urea which is often an ingredient in creams and lotions meant for use on hands and fingers, and several fungicidal agents such as salicylic acid, miconazole branded Monistat, natamycin; and sodium hypochlorite which is the active ingredient in common <b>household</b> <b>bleach</b> (but usually only in 2–3% concentration).|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{disinfection}} method involves {{some form of}} chlorine or its compounds such as chloramine or chlorine dioxide. Chlorine is a strong oxidant that rapidly kills many harmful micro-organisms. Because chlorine is a toxic gas, {{there is a danger}} of a release associated with its use. This problem is avoided by the use of sodium hypochlorite, which is a relatively inexpensive solution used in <b>household</b> <b>bleach</b> that releases free chlorine when dissolved in water. Chlorine solutions can be generated on site by electrolyzing common salt solutions. A solid form, calcium hypochlorite, releases chlorine on contact with water. Handling the solid, however, requires greater routine human contact through opening bags and pouring than the use of gas cylinders or bleach which are more easily automated. The generation of liquid sodium hypochlorite is both inexpensive and safer than the use of gas or solid chlorine.|$|E
2500|$|Quarantine is {{best for}} control of FCV in catteries and kennels.

40|$|All {{children}} aged under 15 years admitted to hospital in Newcastle upon Tyne between 1974 and 1981 with {{a diagnosis of}} poisoning were studied. After the introduction in 1976 of child resistant containers for salicylates and paracetamol, salicylate poisonings fell dramatically. The other most important medicines to cause poisoning in young children were tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazapines, Lomotil (diphenoxylate and atropine), and iron preparations; these should also be packaged in child resistant containers by regulation.

40|$|It was {{evaluated}} the highest working dilution of the {{sodium hypochlorite solution}} (available as <b>household</b> and laundry <b>bleach,</b> with 2. 5 % of active chlorine) still effective in inactivating Mycobacterium fortuitum {{in the presence of}} different levels of bovine feces as organic soil. The experiments were conducted "in vitro" using filter paper as carriers. The time of contact was one hour at the temperature range of 4 to 8 °C. The blocking of the desinfectant activity was achieved by the dilution using a solution of 0. 5 % sodium thiosulphate with 0. 05 % twenn- 80 (v/v). The remaining microrganisms were cultivated in Lowenstcin-Jensen culture medium and the number of colonies forming unities was statiscally evaluated by the MannWhitneyTest. The results showed that the organic soil affected the desinfectant activity. The working dilutions calculated were 1 : 64 and 1 : 16, respectively, with and without organic soil. In working dilutions higher than 1 : 64 the regularity of the desinfectant action was very poor...|$|R
2500|$|Endospores are {{resistant}} to most agents that would normally kill the vegetative cells they formed from. Unlike persister cells, endospores {{are the result of}} a morphological differentiation process triggered by nutrient limitation (starvation) in the environment; endosporulation is initiated by quorum sensing within the [...] "starving" [...] population. Most disinfectants such as household cleaning products, alcohols, quaternary ammonium compounds and detergents have little effect on endospores. However, sterilant alkylating agents (e.g. ethylene oxide), and 10% bleach are effective against endospores. To kill most anthrax spores, standard <b>household</b> <b>bleach</b> (with 10% sodium hypochlorite) must be in contact with the spores for at least several minutes; a very small proportion of spores can survive longer than 10 minutes in such a solution. Higher concentrations of bleach are not more effective, and can cause some types of bacteria to aggregate and thus survive.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Professional use of {{hypochlorite}} (bleach) {{has been}} associated with respiratory symptoms. Bleach is capable of inactivating allergens, and there are indications that its domestic use may reduce the risk of allergies in children. OBJECTIVE: To study the associations between <b>household</b> use of <b>bleach</b> and atopic sensitization, allergic diseases, and respiratory health status in adults. METHODS: We identified 3626 participants of the European Community Respiratory Health Survey II in 10 countries who did the cleaning in their homes and for whom data on specific serum IgE to 4 environmental allergens were available. Frequency of bleach use and information on respiratory symptoms were obtained in face-to-face interviews. House dust mite and cat allergens in mattress dust were measured in a subsample. Associations between the frequency of bleach use and health outcomes were evaluated by using multivariable mixed logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: The use of bleach was associated with less atopic sensitization (odds ratio [OR], 0. 75; 95 % CI, 0. 63 - 0. 89). This association was apparent for specific IgE to both indoor (cat) and outdoor (grass) allergens, and was consistent in various subgroups, including those without any history of respiratory problems (OR, 0. 85). Dose-response relationships (P <. 05) were apparent for the frequency of bleach use and sensitization rates. Lower respiratory tract symptoms, but not allergic symptoms, were more prevalent among those using bleach 4 or more days per week (OR, 1. 24 - 1. 49). The use of bleach was not associated with indoor allergen concentrations. CONCLUSION: People who clean their homes with hypochlorite bleach {{are less likely to be}} atopic but more likely to have respiratory symptoms...|$|R
40|$|Developmental {{exposure}} to phthalates {{may be associated}} with adverse health outcomes but information on the variability and predictors of urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations during pregnancy is limited. We evaluated in Spanish pregnant women (n= 391) the reproducibility of urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations and predictors of exposure. We measured mono-(4 -methyl- 7 -hydroxyoctyl) phthalate (7 -OHMMeOP), mono-(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), mono-(2 -ethyl- 5 -hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), mono-(2 -ethyl- 5 -oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), mono-(2 -ethyl- 5 -carboxypentyl) phthalate (MECPP), mono-(2 -carboxyhexyl) phthalate (MCMHP), mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP), mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP), mono-iso-butyl phthalate (MiBP) and mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) in two spot urine samples collected in the first and third pregnancy trimesters. Questionnaires on predictors and food-frequency questionnaires were administered in the first and/or third pregnancy trimesters. Using creatinine-adjusted phthalate metabolite concentrations (log 10 -trasformed) we calculated intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Linear mixed and regression models assessed the associations between predictors and phthalate metabolites. The ICCs ranged from 0. 24 to 0. 07 and were higher for MBzP, MEP, MiBP, and lower for MEOHP and MEHHP. Overweight, lower education and social class, and less frequent consumption of organic food were associated with higher levels of some phthalate metabolites. The use of <b>household</b> cleaning products (<b>bleach,</b> ammonia, glass cleaners, oven cleaning sprays and degreasing products) at least once per week during pregnancy was associated with 10 - 44 % higher urinary phthalate metabolites. Bottled-water consumption, consumption of food groups usually stored in plastic containers or cans, use of plastic containers for heating food and cosmetic use were not associated with increased concentrations of phthalate metabolites. This large study with repeated phthalate measurements suggests that, in this Spanish setting, sociodemographic and lifestyle factors and household cleaning product use are better predictors of phthalate exposure levels in pregnant women than average water and food consumption and use of plastic containers and cosmetics. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|It was {{recently}} shown that {{substantial amounts of}} halogenated volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are formed in chlorine-bleach-containing household products {{as a result of}} reactions of sodium hypochlorite with organic product components. Use of these household products results in elevated indoor air halogenated VOC concentrations. Halogenated VOCs in several chlorine-bleach-containing household products (plain, n= 9; fragranced, n= 4; and surfactant-added, n= 29) from Europe and North America were measured in the present study. Chloroform and carbon tetrachloride were the dominating compounds having average concentrations of 9. 5 ± 29. 0 (average±SD) and 23. 2 ± 44. 3 (average±SD) mgL- 1, respectively. Halogenated VOC concentrations were the lowest in plain bleach, slightly higher in fragranced products and the highest in the surfactant-added products. Investigation {{of the relationship between the}} halogenated VOCs and several product ingredients indicated that chlorinated VOC formation is closely related to product composition. Indoor air concentrations from the <b>household</b> use of <b>bleach</b> products (i. e., bathroom, kitchen, and hallway cleaning) were estimated for the two dominating VOCs (chloroform and carbon tetrachloride). Estimated indoor concentrations ranged between 0. 5 and 1030 (34 ± 123, average±SD) μgm- 3 and 0. 3 - 1124 (82 ± 194, average±SD) μgm- 3 for chloroform and carbon tetrachloride, respectively, indicating substantial increases compared to background. Results indicated that indoor air concentrations from surfactant-added products were significantly higher (p< 0. 01) than other categories. The highest concentrations were from the use of surfactant-added bleach products for bathroom cleaning (92 ± 228 and 224 ± 334 μgm- 3, average±SD for chloroform and carbon tetrachloride, respectively). Associated carcinogenic risks from the use of these products were also estimated. The risk levels may reach to considerably high levels for a significant portion of the population especially for those steadily using the surfactant-added bleach products. Based on the results of the present study, it could be recommended that if possible the use of chlorine <b>bleach</b> containing <b>household</b> products should be avoided. If they are to be used, plain products should be preferred since the chlorinated VOC content increase with the number and amount of additives...|$|R
