50|$|The Apple Desktop Bus (ADB) was {{introduced}} on the Apple IIGS in 1986. This peripheral bus {{was intended to}} connect low-speed input devices like keyboards and computer mice. Looking for a low-cost connector, the design team selected the 4-pin mini-DIN connector, which is also used for S-Video. ADB only used one <b>data</b> <b>pin</b> and +5V and ground, leaving one pin free. This was used to implement the PSW connection, used {{to turn on the}} machine.

50|$|The {{most common}} version, called DDC2B, {{is based on}} I²C, a serial bus. Pin 12, ID1 of the VGA {{connector}} is now used as the <b>data</b> <b>pin</b> from the I²C bus, and the formerly-unused pin 15 became the I²C clock; pin 9, previously used as a mechanical key, supplied +5V DC power up to 50mA to drive the EEPROM, this allows the host to read the EDID even if the monitor is powered off. Though I²C is fully bidirectional and supports multiple bus-masters, DDC2B is unidirectional and allows only one bus master - the graphics adapter. The monitor acts as a slave device at the 7-bit I²C address 50h, and provides 128-256 bytes of read-only EDID. Because this access is always a read, the first I²C octet will always be A1h.|$|E

40|$|In {{contrast}} to continent/continent collision, arc–continent collision generates very short-lived orogeny because the buoyancy-driven impedance of the subduction of continental lithosphere, accompanied by arc/suprasubduction-zone ophiolite obduction, is relieved by subduction polarity reversal (flip).

Strain rates were a typical plate-boundary-zone 10 - 15. Metamorphism, to the second sillimanite isograd, with extensive partial melting, occurred within a few my after initial collision, indicating that conductive models for metamorphic heat transfer in Barrovian terrains are incorrect and must be replaced by advective models in which large volumes of mafic/ultramafic magma are emplaced, syn-tectonically, below and into evolving nappe stacks.

40|$|Power line {{communications}} (PLC) {{has been}} considered by utility companies for over a half century and for home networking in recent years. However, PLC at the IC level, or even at the PCB level, has not been investigated outside Dr. Ha’s research group. This thesis investigates the feasibility of PLC over power distribution networks (PDNs) of advanced microprocessors. A PDN in an integrated circuit (IC) is ubiquitous as seen by the internal logic, i. e., a power line is accessible to any internal node. This suggests the possibility of monitoring or controlling the logic value of any internal node through a power line by attaching a simple sensing/control circuit to the node. Routing the data through a power line avoids the necessity of preplanning the routing of a data path between the node and an external <b>data</b> <b>pin.</b> PLC over microprocessor PDNs also provide a viable means for ‘run-time testing ’ {{as well as for}} monitoring the so called ‘large time-constant errors ’ resulting from aging and temperature variations. In this thesis, we considered impulse-based ultra wideband (I-UWB) communication technology for PLC over PDNs of microprocessors. I-UWB has several advantages for PLC over PDNs due to its robustness to multipath effects, simple hardware fo...|$|E
40|$|The {{distribution}} of Ge islands is analysed {{in order to}} understand their optical behaviour. The Ce islands described in this paper were deposited by low-pressure chemical vapour deposition at relatively high temperature (700 degrees C), therefore the diffusion length of adatoms is high (similar to 100 mu m) and thus, not the limiting factor for nucleation. By changing the deposition time and the coverage, square-based pyramids, domes and relaxed domes are nucleated. Mainly domes emit light, the emission being in the wavelength range 1. 38 - 1. 55 mu m. When pyramids or relaxed domes are present, the photoluminescence broadens and decreases in intensity. The electroluminescence of vertically correlated islands increases with the number of layers, i. e. with the number of islands. The nucleation of islands on patterned (001) Si is changed when the deposition is performed on Si mesas with high index facets. The size distribution becomes narrower when the mesa size is decreased. An intermixing of up Bo 40 % Si in the 2 D layer was determined from photoluminescence <b>data.</b> <b>PIN</b> diodes fabricated on patterned wafers show an area-dependent electroluminecence related to a different microstructure of islands on large and small mesas. Finally, the lateral ordering on {hkl} facets is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Many {{areas of}} the {{cerebral}} cortex process sensory information or coordinate motor output necessary for control of movement. Disturbances in cortical cholinergic system can affect locomotor coordination. Spinal cord injury causes severe motor impairment and disturbances in cholinergic signalling can aggravate the situation. Considering the impact of cortical cholinergic firing in locomotion, we focussed the study in understanding the cholinergic alterations in cerebral cortex during spinal cord injury. The gene expression of key enzymes in cholinergic pathway - acetylcholine esterase and choline acetyl transferase showed significant upregulation in the cerebral cortex of spinal cord injured group compared to control with the fold increase in expression of acetylcholine esterase prominently higher than cholineacetyl transferase. The decreased muscarinic receptor density and reduced immunostaining of muscarinic receptor subtypes along with down regulated gene expression of muscarinic M 1 and M 3 receptor subtypes accounts for dysfunction of metabotropic acetylcholine receptors in spinal cord injury group. Ionotropic acetylcholine receptor alterations were evident from the decreased gene expression of alpha 7 nicotinic receptors and reduced immunostaining of alpha 7 nicotinic receptors in confocal imaging. Our <b>data</b> <b>pin</b> points the disturbances in cortical cholinergic function due to spinal cord injury; which can augment the locomotor deficits.

40|$|International audienceMating {{systems are}} thought to {{play a key role}} in {{molecular}} evolution through their effects on effective population size (N-e) and effective recombination rate. Because of reduced N-e selection in self-fertilizing species is supposed to be less efficient, allowing fixation of weakly deleterious alleles or lowering adaptation, which may jeopardize their long-term evolution. Relaxed selection pressures in selfers should be detectable at the molecular level through the analyses of the ratio of nonsynonymous and synonymous divergence, D-n/D-s or the ratio of nonsynonymous and synonymous polymorphism, pi(n) /pi(s). On the other hand, selfing reveals recessive alleles to selection (homozygosity effect), which may counterbalance the reduction in N-e Through population genetics models, this study investigates which process may prevail in natural populations and which conditions are necessary to detect evidence for relaxed selection signature at the molecular level in sellers. Under a Aide range of plausible population and mutation parameters, relaxed selection against deleterious mutations should be detectable, but the differences between the two mating systems can be weak. At equilibrium, differences between outcrossers and selfers should be more pronounced using divergence measures (D-n/D-s ratio) than using polymorphism <b>data</b> (<b>pi(n)</b> /pi(s) ratio). The difference in adaptive substitution rates between outcrossers and selfers is much less predictable because it critically depends on the dominance levels of new advantageous mutations, which are poorly known. Different ways of testing these predictions are suggested, and implications of these results for the evolution of self-fertilizing species are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Recent {{progresses}} in high-throughput proteomics {{have provided}} us with a first chance to characterize protein interaction networks (PINs), but also raised new challenges in interpreting the accumulating data. Results Motivated by the need of analyzing and interpreting the fast-growing data {{in the field of}} proteomics, we propose a comparative strategy to carry out global analysis of PINs. We compare two PINs by combining interaction topology and sequence similarity to identify conserved network substructures (CoNSs). Using this approach we perform twenty-one pairwise comparisons among the seven recently available PINs of E. coli, H. pylori, S. cerevisiae, C. elegans, D. melanogaster, M. musculus and H. sapiens. In spite of the incompleteness of <b>data,</b> <b>PIN</b> comparison discloses species conservation at the network level and the identified CoNSs are also functionally conserved and involve in basic cellular functions. We investigate the yeast CoNSs and find that many of them correspond to known complexes. We also find that different species harbor many conserved interaction regions that are topologically identical and these regions can constitute larger interaction regions that are topologically different but similar in framework. Based on the species-to-species difference in CoNSs, we infer potential species divergence. It seems that different species organize orthologs in similar but not necessarily the same topology to achieve similar or the same function. This attributes much to duplication and divergence of genes and their associated interactions. Finally, as the application of CoNSs, we predict 101 protein-protein interactions (PPIs), annotate 339 new protein functions and deduce 170 pairs of orthologs. Conclusion Our result demonstrates that the cross-species comparison strategy we adopt is powerful for the exploration of biological problems from the perspective of networks. </p...|$|E
40|$|Peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans {{isomerase}} NIMA-interacting 1 (Pin 1) is {{a unique}} enzyme that associates with the pSer/Thr-Pro motif and catalyzes cis-trans isomerization. We identified Pin 1 in the immunoprecipitates of overexpressed IRS- 1 with myc and FLAG tags in mouse livers and confirmed the association between IRS- 1 and Pin 1 by not only overexpression experiments but also endogenously in the mouse liver. The analysis using deletion- and point-mutated Pin 1 and IRS- 1 constructs revealed the WW domain located in the N terminus of Pin 1 and Ser- 434 in the SAIN (Shc and IRS- 1 NPXY binding) domain of IRS- 1 {{to be involved in}} their association. Subsequently, we investigated the role of Pin 1 in IRS- 1 mediation of insulin signaling. The overexpression of Pin 1 in HepG 2 cells markedly enhanced insulin-induced IRS- 1 phosphorylation and its downstream events: phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase binding with IRS- 1 and Akt phosphorylation. In contrast, the treatment of HepG 2 cells with Pin 1 siRNA or the Pin 1 inhibitor Juglone suppressed these events. In good agreement with these in vitro <b>data,</b> <b>Pin</b> 1 knock-out mice exhibited impaired insulin signaling with glucose intolerance, whereas adenoviral gene transfer of Pin 1 into the ob/ob mouse liver mostly normalized insulin signaling and restored glucose tolerance. In addition, it was also demonstrated that Pin 1 plays a critical role in adipose differentiation, making Pin 1 knock-out mice resistant to diet-induced obesity. Importantly, Pin 1 expression was shown to be up-regulated in accordance with nutrient conditions such as food intake or a high-fat diet. Taken together, these observations indicate that Pin 1 binds to IRS- 1 and thereby markedly enhances insulin action, essential for adipogenesis...|$|E
