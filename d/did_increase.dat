In the long run, as Toohey (2008) reports, many of the hoped-for benefits failed to materialize. Nationwide levels of participation in physical activity and sport did not rise, although passive spectatorship (such as TV watching) <b>did</b> <b>increase.</b> Many of the costly facilities built for the games remained underutilized in their wake.|$|E

While the Republican Congress did not support a federally-mandated {{increase in the minimum wage}}, 18 states <b>did</b> <b>increase</b> their minimum wages, benefiting an estimated 7 million workers, following the President's 2013 State of the Union speech calling for an increase. During late 2015, the House and Senate, in rare bipartisan form, passed the largest infrastructure package in a decade, costing $305 billion over five years, less than the $478 billion in Obama's initial request. He signed the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act into law in December 2015.|$|E
25|$|The {{plant is}} {{on a bluff}} which was {{originally}} 35 meters above sea level. During construction, however, TEPCO lowered {{the height of the}} bluff by 25 meters. One reason for lowering the bluff was to allow the base of the reactors to be constructed on solid bedrock in order to mitigate the threat posed by earthquakes. Another reason was the lowered height would keep the running costs of the seawater pumps low. TEPCO's analysis of the tsunami risk when planning the site's construction determined that the lower elevation was safe because the sea wall would provide adequate protection for the maximum tsunami assumed by the design basis. However, the lower site elevation <b>did</b> <b>increase</b> the vulnerability for a tsunami larger than anticipated in design.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, a researcher, Ken Simmons, {{introduced}} CaCO3 {{into the}} Whetstone Brook in Massachusetts. His {{hope was that}} the calcium carbonate would counter the acid in the stream from acid rain and save the trout that had ceased to spawn. Although his experiment was a success, it <b>did</b> <b>increase</b> the amount of aluminium ions {{in the area of}} the brook that was not treated with the limestone. This shows that CaCO3 can be added to neutralize the effects of acid rain in river ecosystems. Currently calcium carbonate is used to neutralize acidic conditions in both soil and water. Since the 1970s, such liming has been practiced on a large scale in Sweden to mitigate acidification and several thousand lakes and streams are limed repeatedly.|$|E

25|$|Joint {{injection}} of glucocorticoids (such as hydrocortisone) leads to short term pain relief that may last between {{a few weeks}} and a few months. Injections of hyaluronic acid have not produced improvement compared to placebo for knee arthritis, but <b>did</b> <b>increase</b> risk of further pain. In ankle osteoarthritis, evidence is unclear. The effectiveness of injections of platelet-rich plasma is unclear; there are suggestions that such injections improve function but not pain, and are associated with increased risk. A 2015 Cochrane review found that intra-articular corticosteroid injections of the knee did not benefit quality of life, {{had no effect on}} knee joint space, and clinical effects one to six weeks after injection could not be determined clearly due to poor study quality.|$|E
25|$|The Soviets {{were now}} over the most {{critical}} phase. Novikov now drew the conclusion that Soviet air forces could be effective by instituting changes. All bombers were to be escorted, Soviet fighter pilots were encouraged {{to be more aggressive}} and take part in low-level suppression attacks, and more night strikes owing to an absence of German night fighter forces would be less costly. Soviet forces <b>did</b> <b>increase</b> their effectiveness. Despite Loerzer's Corps claiming 487 Soviet aircraft destroyed in the air and 1,211 on the ground between 22 June and 13 July, aerial resistance was clearly mounting. On 13 July Army Group North counted 354 Soviet machines in the skies. All this compelled the Luftwaffe to return to bombing airfields. Of particular concern was the taran tactic. The VVS carried out 60 of these attacks in July.|$|E
25|$|Cline's privately {{published}} work Hope for high risk and rage filled children also cites family therapist and hypnotherapist Milton Erickson as a source, and reprints {{parts of a}} case of Erickson's published in 1961. The report describes {{the case of a}} divorced mother with a non-compliant son. Erickson advised the mother to sit on the child {{for hours at a time}} and to feed him only on cold oatmeal while she and a daughter ate appetizing food. The child <b>did</b> <b>increase</b> in compliance, and Erickson noted, with apparent approval, that he trembled when his mother looked at him. Cline commented, with respect to this and other cases, that in his opinion all bonds were trauma bonds. According to Cline, it illustrates the three essential components of 1) taking control, 2) the child's expression of rage; and, 3) relaxation and the development of bonding.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{uses the}} old-Keynesian {{representative}} agent model developed in Farmer (2010 b) to answer two questions: 1) <b>do</b> <b>increased</b> government purchases crowd out private consumption? 2) <b>do</b> <b>increased</b> government purchases reduce unemployment? Farmer compared permanent tax financed expenditure paths {{and showed that}} the answer to 1) was yes and the answer to 2) was no. We generalize his result to temporary bond-financed paths of government purchases that are similar to the actual path that occurred during WWII. We find that a temporary increase in government purchases does crowd out private consumption expenditure as in Farmer (2010 b). However, in contrast to Farmer's experiment we find that a temporary increase in government purchases can also reduce unemployment. ...|$|R
