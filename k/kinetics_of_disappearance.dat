In cell-free, postmitochondrial supernatants, we have previously observed that dense endosomes, but not light endosomes, interact with lysosomes. Cell-free interaction between isolated dense endosomes and lysosomes has now been reconstituted and analyzed in three ways: by transfer of radiolabeled ligand from endosomal to lysosomal densities, by a fluorescence dequenching assay which can indicate membrane fusion, and by measurement of content mixing. Maximum transfer of radiolabel to lysosomal densities required ATP and GTP plus cytosolic components, including N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor(s). Dense endosomes incubated in the absence of added lysosomes did not mature into vesicles of lysosomal density. Content mixing, and hence fusion, between endosomes and lysosomes was maximal in the presence of cytosol and ATP and also showed inhibition by N-ethyl-maleimide.

The first part of the paper deals with the formation of these adducts. It is shown that the ternary nucleic acid-cis-platinum-ethidium bromide complexes in which ethidium bromide and nucleotide residues are cross-linked by cis-platinum, are relatively unstable at 37 degrees C. In the presence of acridine, ethidium bromide (but not cis-platinum) is slowly released which leads to the formation of monofunctional cis-platinum-nucleic acid adducts.

Therefore, split applications (two applications of 2 g USG) were studied regarding the change of ammoniacal nitrogen concentration at the point of application. The first application was always at transplanting, at a depth of 10 cm; the second application was made 41 days after transplanting (DAT) (tillering stage) or 62 DAT (panicle initiation).

The pool was also depleted under conditions of amino acid starvation of a “relaxed” strain which accumulated “relaxed” particles. Most, if not all, of the protein present in “relaxed” particles was derived from the pool. The pool represented about 3 to 4 % of the total soluble proteins in the ribosome-free supernatant fluid of an E. coli extract...|$|E
40|$|International audienceReactive {{oxygen species}} are {{by-products}} of aerobic metabolism {{involved in the}} onset and evolution of various pathological conditions. Among them, the superoxide radical is of special interest as the origin of several damaging species such as H 2 O 2, hydroxyl radical, or peroxynitrite (ONOO−). Spin trapping coupled with ESR is a method of choice to characterize these species in chemical and biological systems and the metabolic stability of the spin adducts derived from reaction of superoxide and hydroxyl radicals with nitrones is the main limit to the in vivo application of the method. Recently, new cyclic nitrones bearing a triphenylphosphonium or permethylated β-cyclodextrin moiety have been synthesized and their spin adducts demonstrated increased stability in buffer. In this article, we studied {{the stability of the}} superoxide adducts of four new cyclic nitrones in the presence of liver subcellular fractions and biologically relevant reductants using an original setup combining a stopped-flow device and an ESR spectrometer. The <b>kinetics</b> <b>of</b> <b>disappearance</b> of the spin adducts were analyzed using an appropriate simulation program. Our results highlight the interest of the new spin trapping agents CD-DEPMPO and CD-DIPPMPO for specific detection of superoxide with high stability of the superoxide adducts in the presence of liver microsomes...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{chitosan}} hydrochloride (Ch-HCl) and of N-carboxymethylchitosan (CMCh), formulated in ophthalmic solutions, on the ocular pharmacokinetics of ofloxacin were studied in rabbits. The carboxymethylation of a chitosan of high molecular mass (1460 kDa) and deacetylation degree (89. 9 %) introduced 0. 84 N-carboxymethyl groups per repeating unit. Aqueous solutions containing 1 % (w/v) of either polymer showed a pseudoplastic rheologic behaviour, and, when instilled in rabbit eyes, produced no irritation. The <b>kinetics</b> <b>of</b> drug <b>disappearance</b> from tear fluid and the profiles of drug {{concentration in the}} aqueous humour versus time were determined and interpreted {{in the light of}} a pharmacokinetic model and of drug-polymer binding. Ch-HCl significantly enhanced intraocular drug penetration with respect to an isoviscous drug solution containing poly(vinyl alcohol) and to commercial ofloxacin eyedrops. This effect, which resulted in about 190 % increase of the peak concentration in the aqueous, was ascribed to an increased corneal permeability. The polyanionic CMCh failed to enhance intraocular drug penetration. It nevertheless increased precorneal drug retention in virtue of its viscosity and of ofloxacin binding. Consequently, the residence time at concentrations higher than the MIC 90 and the bioavailability of the antibiotic in the aqueous were increased by about 150 and 240 %, respectively, with respect to the reference vehicle...|$|R
40|$|Nester, E. W. (University of Washington, Seattle). Penicillin {{resistance}} of competent cells in deoxyribonucleic acid transformation of Bacillus subtilis. J. Bacteriol. 87 : 867 – 875. 1964. —Transformants {{are resistant to}} penicillin killing for several hours after deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) addition. The present study indicates that this resistance {{is a consequence of}} such cells still remaining competent and is not the result of any interaction of donor DNA with the recipient cell. The following data support this conclusion: (i) the frequency of transformation can be increased five- to tenfold if penicillin acts on a competent culture prior to DNA addition; (ii) the percentage of competent cells in such a penicillin-treated culture calculated {{on the basis of a}} random coincidence of DNA molecules entering the same cell increases some 25 -fold over that of a penicillin-nontreated population; (iii) the <b>kinetics</b> <b>of</b> penicillin killing of a recipient culture are identical whether or not transforming DNA has been added; (iv) the extent of killing by penicillin is related to the level of competence of the recipient culture; and (v) the <b>kinetics</b> <b>of</b> appearance and <b>disappearance</b> <b>of</b> competence in a population as well as in individual cells indicate that a cell may remain competent for 3 to 4 hr...|$|R
40|$|The <b>kinetics</b> <b>of</b> {{appearance}} and <b>disappearance</b> <b>of</b> three classes of ice nuclei in Pseudomonas syringae was investigated under conditions where high-level {{expression of the}} ice nucleation phenotype was obtained. The appearance of types 1, 2, and 3 ice nuclei, catalyzing nucleation at - 2 to - 5, - 5 to - 7, and - 7 to - 10 degrees C, respectively, was investigated during low-temperature induction in wild-type strains and in a unique, detergent-sensitive mutant that contained no type 3 ice nuclei when grown at 32 degrees C. Nuclei appeared in the following order: type 3, then type 2 and type 1. The <b>disappearance</b> <b>of</b> classes of ice nuclei was monitored during high-temperature treatment of fully induced cells; nuclei disappeared in the order type 1, type 2, and type 3. Although analysis of nucleation events is complicated by masking and unmasking of ice sites in the same cells, these temporal sequences of ice nucleus appearance or disappearance are consistent with an aggregation model for ice nucleus assembly (A. G. Govindarajan and S. E. Lindow, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85 : 1334 - 1338, 1988; G. Warren and P. Wolber, Mol. Microbiol. 5 : 239 - 243, 1991) ...|$|R
