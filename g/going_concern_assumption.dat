50|$|The {{going concern}} {{principle}} allows {{the company to}} defer some of its prepaid expenses until future accounting periods. The <b>going</b> <b>concern</b> <b>assumption</b> is a fundamental assumption {{in the preparation of}} financial statements. Under the <b>going</b> <b>concern</b> <b>assumption,</b> an entity is ordinarily viewed as continuing in business for the foreseeable future with neither the intention nor the necessity of liquidation, ceasing trading or seeking protection from creditors pursuant to laws or regulations. Accordingly, unless the <b>going</b> <b>concern</b> <b>assumption</b> is inappropriate in the circumstances of the entity, assets and liabilities are recorded on the basis that the entity will be able to realize its assets, discharge its liabilities, and obtain refinancing (if necessary) in the normal course of business.|$|E

The 'going concern' concept assumes that the business will remain in existence long enough for all the assets of the business to be fully utilized. Utilized assets means obtaining the complete benefit from their earning potential. (i.e. if you recently purchased equipment costing $5,000 that had 5 years of productive/useful life, then under the <b>going</b> <b>concern</b> <b>assumption,</b> the accountant would only write off one year's value $1,000 (1/5th) this year, leaving $4,000 to be treated as a fixed asset with future economic value for the business).|$|E

50|$|Under the <b>going</b> <b>concern</b> <b>assumption,</b> {{an entity}} {{is viewed as}} {{continuing}} in business for the foreseeable future. General purpose financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, unless management either intends to liquidate the entity or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Special purpose financial statements {{may or may not}} be prepared in accordance with a financial reporting framework for which the going concern basis is relevant (for example, the going concern basis is not relevant for some financial statements prepared on a tax basis in particular jurisdictions).

50|$|Continuation of {{an entity}} as a going concern is assumed in {{financial}} reporting {{in the absence}} of significant information to the contrary. Ordinarily, information that significantly contradicts the <b>going</b> <b>concern</b> <b>assumption</b> relates to the entity's inability to continue to meet its obligations as they become due without substantial disposition of assets outside the ordinary course of business, restructuring of debt, externally forced revisions of its operations, or similar actions.|$|E

The auditor considers such items as negative trends in operating results, loan defaults, denial of trade credit from suppliers uneconomical long-term commitments, and legal proceedings in deciding if there is a substantial doubt about an entity’s ability {{to continue as}} a going concern. If so, the auditor must draw attention to the uncertainty regarding the entity's ability to continue as a going concern, in their auditor's report. On the other hand, inappropriate use of the <b>going</b> <b>concern</b> <b>assumption</b> by an entity may cause the auditor to issue an adverse opinion on the financial statements. [...] This Guidance provides a framework to assist directors, audit committees and finance teams in determining whether it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis for preparing financial statements and in making balanced, proportionate and clear disclosures.

40|$|If {{auditors}} {{question a}} company’s ability to continue existing, they should issue a <b>going</b> <b>concern</b> {{opinion in the}} audit report.
