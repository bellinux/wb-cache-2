The focus of this research paper is to propose an <b>indexing</b> <b>technique</b> for image objects using RST. An <b>indexing</b> <b>technique</b> is proposed for image objects using image relation framework for RST.

Such feature vectors extracted from real world objects are usually {{presented in the}} form of multidimensional data. As a result, many multidimensional data <b>index</b> <b>techniques</b> have been widely introduced to the research community. These <b>index</b> <b>techniques</b> are categorized into two main classes: SP (space partitioning) /KD-tree-based and DP (data partitioning) /R-tree-based. Although {{there are a variety of}} “mixed ” <b>index</b> <b>techniques,</b> which try to inherit positive aspects from more than one <b>index</b> <b>technique,</b> the number of techniques that are derived from these two main classes is just a few.

Due to complexity of today’s database, finding matching records in single database is a crucial one. <b>Indexing</b> <b>techniques</b> are used to efficiently implement record linkage and deduplication.
