I {{want to be able}} to write about things I've never talked about before and tell a story with this album, because I've never {{actually}} had time to go in and do that." [...] For the album, Gomez made it with production team The Cataracs, as well as the Norwegian Stargate. Gomez also worked with Rock Mafia on numerous tracks on the album, having previously worked with them on previous singles with The Scene. For Stars Dance, Gomez attempted to have more creative control over her music, stating [...] "It's definitely the hardest I <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>worked</b> <b>on</b> a record, that's for sure. I wanted to have more creative control over the album's direction." [...] Jason Evigan, who worked with Gomez on the album, said [...] "She's not a little girl anymore. She wants to be like that and be respected like the great pop artists out there ... And I think she is. I think this album is really gonna blossom her into a new realm of electronic pop dance artist." [...] Prior to the album's release, Gomez announced she would be taking a musical hiatus after Stars Dance, commenting [...] "I've been saying that I worked really hard on this record and I feel like it might be my last one for a while ... I definitely love acting and I love film and I don't feel like I've done enough of that." ...|$|E

Written by Johns with art by Frank, it continues the story {{presented in the}} DC Universe: Rebirth Special and [...] "The Button" [...] storyline focusing on Superman and Doctor Manhattan. Speaking on the project, Johns said, [...] "It is Watchmen colliding with the DC Universe. It is the most personal and most epic, utterly mind-bending project I <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>worked</b> <b>on</b> in my career. With Rebirth, I {{opened the door to}} Manhattan. Part of that was I loved the real-world influence Watchmen has. I put Manhattan out there, and always thought there was a Manhattan/Superman story to be told... at the core of it, there’s a being who has lost his humanity, and distanced himself from it, and an alien who embodies humanity more than most humans. I love the idea that Watchmen influenced DC, but what would that look like in reverse? And it goes well beyond that." [...] Johns indicated the miniseries would not be a sequel to Watchmen and would be a stand alone story, with no tie-in material. Despite this, Johns noted Doomsday Clock [...] " [...] {{have an impact on the}} entire DC Universe. It will affect everything moving forward and everything that has come before. It will touch the thematic and literal essence of DC." [...] Johns also noted that the miniseries would be set one year in the future of the DC Universe, so by the time the final issue releases, [...] "the rest of the universe will have caught up to it — and the repercussions of the event will become known." ...|$|E

For most of the recording process, only three other people were in the studio with Madonna: William Orbit, an engineer named Pat McCarthy, and his assistant engineer, Matt Silva. They started recording in Los Angeles, but the recording process was initially plagued with machinery problems, as Orbit preferred to work with samples, synth sounds, and Pro Tools, and not with live musicians. The computers would break down, and recording would have to be delayed until they could be repaired. Orbit recorded the bulk of the album's instrumentation over a four-month period. Orbit recalls playing the guitar and having his fingers bleed during the long hours he spent in the studio.|$|R
5000|$|Prometheus and Pandora are two {{characters}} {{returning from the}} first ZX. In this title, their origins are revealed as sibling creations of Master Albert.

5000|$|Music composers of Xenoblade Chronicles, Yasunori Mitsuda, ACE (Tomori Kudo and Hiroyo [...] "Chico" [...] Yamanaka), Kenji Hiramatsu, and Manami Kiyota, {{returned}} to compose the game's soundtrack. The soundtrack features performances from the Bratislava Symphony Choir and the Irish-based vocal ensemble Anúna, {{with the latter}} providing song mixes that Mitsuda later revealed to have made him cry. Two vocal tracks, including the ending theme penned by Mitsuda, were sung by Jennifer Bird of the English acoustic duo Tomorrow Bird. Before recording, Mitsuda communicated with her so that Bird could properly convey the characters' emotions through her singing. While recording the melody section, Bird was able to improvise elements of her singing, something that did not normally happen with Mitsuda's arrangements.

Although Kojima planned to leave the project {{in the hands of}} other members from Kojima Productions, {{in order to make the}} plot's message clearer for the young demographic, he took the role of director at the same time as he was developing Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots. [...] The game was made for the PlayStation Portable due to content that could only <b>work</b> <b>on</b> it, such as the cooperative multiplayer feature. While being a stealth-based game like the previous titles, new gameplay features such as the customization and levelling up were added to increase the replay value. The use of a cooperative mode is intended to have players help each other and grow a sense of friendship. The development team that <b>worked</b> <b>on</b> Peace Walker was as large as the team that <b>worked</b> <b>on</b> Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots. Although several of the staff members had already <b>worked</b> <b>on</b> Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops, Peace Walker was created with a different mindset.

According to him, the game's setting revolved around conflict and its effects. In addition to Sakaguchi's work, Japanese novelist Kiyoshi Shigematsu created over thirty stories detailing Kaim's life as an immortal, titled [...] "A Thousand Years of Dreams". According to Shigematsu, {{it was the first time}} he <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>worked</b> <b>on</b> a video game, and was unsure about whether he could evoke emotion as he did in his books. In the end, he found that the interactive medium gave his work a new impact that moved him to tears upon seeing it in place. These story segments were presented in the game in a similar style to a visual novel, as the stories were intended to evoke emotion. The gameplay, such as the battle system, was kept deliberately traditional so that Sakaguchi had freedom to experiment with the story. Despite this, he wanted to introduce new real-time elements into the system. One of the elements Sakaguchi checked was how story and gameplay were balanced: sometimes, he would ask for a cutscene to be removed or for a boss battle to be lengthened if the balance seemed off.|$|R
5000|$|In 1977 Chantrell was {{commissioned}} by 20th Century Fox to produce poster art for the British release of a space fantasy film, Star Wars. Several promotional posters had already been produced to advertise Star Wars prior to Chantrell's involvement; artist Tom Jung was initially commissioned by Fox to create a poster, which was used to advertise the USA release. Now known as , this artwork was considered by Lucasfilm to be [...] "too dark" [...] and they commissioned a reworking of the image from the Brothers Hildebrandt, and their [...] was distributed to UK cinemas. Because these posters had both been produced while Star Wars was still in production, the artists had worked without reference to photographs of the actual cast. Fox executives considered the posters too abstract and were keen to commission a new version with fully realised likenesses of the lead actors. Chantrell was invited {{with his family to}} the film premiere, and he was given a pack of film stills and publicity photos to use as a reference for his painting. He took one month to complete the poster, the longest he <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>worked</b> <b>on</b> one poster.

In 1955 he and five others sailed a junk renamed Free China from Taiwan to San Francisco, escaping the oppressive government in control at the time while also persuading that government to sponsor the trip as the Taiwanese entry in a boat race that was to run between USA's east coast and Sweden. None of the men <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>worked</b> <b>on</b> a sail ship before. One of the five men was the USA Vice-consul to Taiwan who was placed on board to document the trip and a documentary movie was released. The journey was initially abandoned due to poor weather.

While acclaimed as a sensation upon arrival Free China eventually fell into disrepair over the next several decades. It was privately repaired in the late 80s and as at 2007, after having been lost for several years, there was talk of it returning it to Taiwan.

5000|$|The most {{interesting}} sidelight {{on the man}} is the novel way he approached a new invention. It is exactly the opposite of Edison’s method, according to reports of the working practices. When Edison got interested in a new idea it is said that, first, he researched {{to find out what}} has already been done to solve the problem. This preliminary preparation took weeks, sometimes months; the theory being to avoid duplication of effort. This period of preparation {{may have something to do}} with Edison’s alleged remark that “genius is five per cent inspiration and ninety-five percent perspiration.” Yet there seems to be another type of genius in which inspiration plays a much larger part, and Reuben Benjamin was an example. “When I visualize some desirable result,” he explained, “I prefer to head for it directly. This means, first of all, clearing my mind as much as possible of everything that may have been done about it previously. My memory isn’t particularly good and, strange as it may seem, I believe that this is a help rather than a drawback because then my brain isn’t cluttered up with old information. I try to proceed straight toward the objective just as though no one else <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>worked</b> <b>on</b> the problem.
