Room temperature carrier densities reduced by {{an order of}} magnitude while a threefold maximum increase in mobility was observed. By using a two-carrier analysis, it was found that, apart from parallel conduction passivation, the hydrogenation process also improves the channel mobility directly.

40|$|Thin {{evaporated}} {{films have}} been used to study the effects on reflection and transmission of visible and near visible light through solids by modulating the temperature of the specimen and the electric field in which it is situated. The principal aims of the studies were;(a) to obtain reliable data for comparison with electronic band structure calculations(b) to investigate a possible device application. Thermally modulated reflectance measurements have been performed on thick absorbing films of gold and copper and on the heavy rare earth metals, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium and erbium. The modulated reflectance results have been transformed to Deltae 2, the change in the imaginary part of the dielectric constant, by the Kramers-Kronig method of analysis. The Ae 2 spectra have been correlated with electronic band structure calculations. Shifts in the principal absorption edges of gold and copper with temperature (shifts of - 2. 3 x 10 4 eV/k and - 1. 2 x 10 4 eV/K respectively), not - previously observed in thermal modulation experiments although theoretically predicted by expanded lattice band structure calculations, have been detected, The technique {{has been found to be}} capable of locating weak structure in the Deltae 2 dispersion curve. New thermal modulation experiments on the heavy rare earth metals have enabled changes in the DeltaRp/Rp spectra to be observed as the temperature of the sample is decreased. These changes occur at the magnetic ordering temperatures and have not previously been observed using conventional static reflectance. By using electro-modulation, an integrated thin film optical modulator has been produced. The device has been constructed from thermally evaporated thin films of aluminium, silicon monoxide and cadmium sulphide, the latter being the active medium. Modulation degrees of between 10 and 15 % have been observed for very low modulating voltages ~ 15 volts. However the device is limited by the very large insertion loss at the centre of the cadmium sulphide absorption edge. Some studies have been made on the electro-modulation of metals using a "dry-package" configuration. No electro-modulation response of the metal was observed. This null result is in contradiction to electrolytic measurements. Computational analysis has been performed to demonstrate that the electroreflectance spectra observed using the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>technique</b> may not be an electro-modulation of the optical constants of the metal but an absorption induced by the modulating electric field in the Gouy region of the electrolyte. <p...|$|E

INTRODUCTION: Immediately {{adjacent}} to large hepatic veins, tumour ablation by radiofrequency or electrolysis may be impaired by heat or current sink effects. Ablation may also cause vessel injury and thrombosis. The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency and <b>electrolytic</b> ablative <b>techniques</b> {{adjacent to}} large hepatic veins. METHODS: Electrolytic and radiofrequency zones of ablation were created adjacent to hepatic veins in large white pigs. After 72 h the zones of ablation created were examined histologically for (a) the extent of tissue necrosis up to the vessel and (b) the presence of intimal damage and mural thrombus in the veins. RESULTS: An unexpected complication of electrolysis near large veins was cardiac tamponade. This current related phenomenon could easily be avoided. In seven of nine electrolysis zones of ablation necrosis was completely adjacent to the vessel wall, but in only four of seven radiofrequency zones of ablation. All zones of ablation were associated with intimal necrosis, and most with mural thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: Ablation of hepatic tumours by radiofrequency and electrolysis is unreliable adjacent to hepatic veins. Both techniques are associated with mural thrombus formation, and so risk thrombo-embolic complication. These ablative modalities are not recommended for zones of ablation adjacent to hepatic veins.

The spectroelectrochemical and ESR data clearly demonstrated the generation of the semiquinone radical of PQQ in holo-sGDH and in the free state in the presence of Ca(2 +). In contrast, in the absence of Ca(2 +) no semiquinone was observed, either for PQQ in the free state (at pH 7. 0) or in the enzyme (holo-X). Incorporation of Ca(2 +) into the active site of holo-X, yielding holo-sGDH, caused not only stabilization of the semiquinone form of PQQ but also a negative shift (of 26. 5 mV) of the two-electron redox potential, indicating that the effect of Ca(2 +) is stronger on the oxidized than on the reduced PQQ. Combining these data with the observations on the kinetic and chemical mechanisms, it was concluded that the strong stimulating effect of Ca(2 +) on the activity of sGDH can be attributed to facilitation of certain kinetic steps, and not to improvement of the thermodynamics of substrate oxidation. The consequences of this conclusion are discussed for the oxidative {{as well as for the}} reductive part of the reaction of sGDH...|$|R

Three kinds of cast-iron bonded diamond wheels with different grain size were adopted to get different grinding efficiency and surface quality of workpieces. The grinding properties of cast-iron bonded grinding wheels with different grain size and the ground surface quality of tungsten carbide are discussed in this paper. The experiment results indicate that, under the same feeding amount, the grinding efficiency of the wheel with bigger grain size is higher, and it could make the dimension accuracy of the workpiece controllable, but the wheel with smaller grain size could get better ground surface quality. The two grinding phases are decided by the ratio between the size of abrasive grain and the thickness of the oxide layer on the grinding wheel...|$|R
40|$|A high donor {{concentration}} (> 10 is cm- 3) obviously {{enhances the}} thermal oxidation. The p-type SiC oxida-tion data are added in Table III for comparison. Electrolytic etching in a 2 : 1 mixture {{of alcohol and}} 40 % HF is mainly used for the delineation of p+p- and n+n- junct ions and for those p-n junctions where both sides are very lightly doped. The delineation which is accomplished partly by surface attack and partly by sLaining may be markedly enhanced by a subsequent oxidation. Thus, the combination of electrolytic etch-ing and oxidation {{has been found to}} be successful for the delineation of all junctions of practical interest. Furthermore, the existence of doping inhomogeneities can be revealed by this technique. Figure 3 shows an angle lap of an n-type pitaxial SiC layer on an n-type substrate. It is clearly seen that there are impurity striations in the substrate whereas the doping of the epitaxial layer is uniform. In conclusion, it can be stated that the thermal oxidation of silicon carbide is a useful tool for polytype discrimination. An unambiguous determination of the polytype (6 H or 15 R), however, is possible only in those cases where the dependence of the oxidation rate on the conductivity type and the doping level is neg-ligible or can be taken into account properly.

Moreover, it is shown that top clearance and draft diameter affect flow resistance. However, the bubble redistribution with a screen mesh on the perforated plate distributor for macro-mixing is insignificant. The top region with a high energy dissipation rate is a suitable location for feeding reactants.

It is found that the increase in superficial gas velocity corresponds to the increase in energy input, liquid circulation velocity and shear rate, decreasing the macro-mixing time and segregation index. Moreover, it is shown that top clearance and draft diameter affect flow resistance. However, the bubble redistribution with a screen mesh on the perforated plate distributor for macro-mixing is insignificant. The top region with a high energy dissipation rate is a suitable location for feeding reactants. The analysis of present experimental data provides a valuable insight into the interaction between gas and liquid phases for mixing and improves the understanding of intrinsic roles of hydrodynamics upon the reactor design and operating parameter selection...|$|R
40|$|An {{electrochemical}} method of fabrication of (NiCoCrAlY) /MgO/Yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) multilayered coating was proposed. This multilayered coat {{is expected to}} work as a thermal barrier coating (TBC) for nickel superalloy substrates. The (NiCoCrAlY) layer was deposited using the electrophoretic deposition technique, the MgO layer was deposited by the <b>electrolytic</b> deposition <b>technique</b> and the YSZ layer was electrophoretically deposited. In order to study the deposit morphology and to determine the appropriate processing parameters for the multilayered coat, one-layer coatings of (NiCoCrAlY), MgO and YSZ were deposited and characterized. At first, the process of depositing (NiCoCrAlY) alloy particles using an aqueous media with AlCl 3 or Al(NO 3) 3 as an electrolyte revealed that the alloy particles were deposited {{at the same time as}} aluminium oxide. The co-deposited aluminium oxide worked as a binder between the particles and the substrate. In the electrolytic deposition process of the MgO coating, the layer deposited from Mg(NO 3) 2 solution was mainly magnesium hydroxide and it had to be calcinated to form a MgO coating. An optimization of the deposition process demonstrated that a crack free deposit of MgO could be obtained at low current density. An optimum condition of the electrophoretic deposition process was established for YSZ; it was found that adding 5 % water to the acetone bath increased the deposition rate of the YSZ particles, and had increased the porosity in the coat. A composite coating of (NiCoCrAlY) /MgO was formed after heat treatment at 850 °C for 1 hr. The electrochemically deposited MgO was easily sintered at 850 °C, which resulted in a dense ceramic coating that protects the substrate and the (NiCoCrAlY) coating from oxidation during sintering of the electrophoretically deposited YSZ layer at 1100 °C...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis work is to develop methods for forming and interfacing nanocrystal-molecule nanostructures in order to explore their electrical transport properties in various controlled environments. This work demonstrates the potential of nanocrystal assemblies for laterally contacting molecules for electronic transport measurements. We first propose a phenomenological model based on rate equations {{for the formation of}} hybrid nanocrystal-molecule (respectively: 20 nm – 1. 2 nm) nanostructures in solution. We then concentrate on nanocrystals (~ 60 nm) assembled between nano-gaps (~ 40 nm) as a contacting strategy for the measurement of electronic transport properties of thiophene-terminated conjugated molecules (1. 5 nm long) in a two-terminal configuration, under vacuum conditions. Similar devices were also probed with a three-terminal configuration using thiophene-terminated oxidation-reduction active molecules (1. 8 nm long) in liquid medium for the demonstration of the <b>electrolytic</b> gating <b>technique.</b> The experimental and modelling work presented in this thesis project brings into light physical and chemical processes taking place at the extremely narrow (~ 1 nm separation) and curved interface between two nanocrystals or one nanocrystal and a grain of a metallic electrode. The formation of molecular bridges at this kind of interface necessitates molecules to diffuse from a large liquid reservoir into the region in the first place. Molecular bonding must occur to the surface for both molecular ends: this is a low yield statistical process in itself as it depends on orientation of surfaces, on steric hindrance at the surface and on binding energies. On the other hand, the experimental work also touched the importance of the competition between potentially immiscible liquids in systems such that (organo-) metallic molecules solvated by organic solvent in water and organic solvent in contact with hydrated citrate stabilised nanocrystals dispersed in solutions or assembled between electrodes from both experimental and simulations point of view...|$|R
