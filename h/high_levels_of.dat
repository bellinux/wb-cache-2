5|$|<b>High</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> {{molybdenum}} {{can interfere}} with the body's uptake of copper, producing copper deficiency. Molybdenum prevents plasma proteins from binding to copper, and it also increases the amount of copper that is excreted in urine. Ruminants that consume <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> molybdenum suffer from diarrhea, stunted growth, anemia, and achromotrichia (loss of fur pigment). These symptoms can be alleviated by copper supplements, either dietary and injection. The effective copper deficiency, can be aggravated by excess sulfur.|$|E

For instance, it has been shown that, among {{university}} students, higher FA is associated with <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> schizotypy. Depression scores {{have been found to be}} higher in men, but not women, with <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> FA. One study by Shackelford and Larsen found that men and women with higher facial asymmetry reported more physiological complaints than those with lower facial asymmetry, and that both men and women with higher asymmetry experienced <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> psychological distress overall. For example, men with higher facial asymmetry experienced <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> depression compared to men with lower facial asymmetry. Fluctuating asymmetry has also been studied in relation to psychopathy. One study looking at offenders and non-offenders found that, although offenders had <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> FA overall, psychopathic offenders had lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> FA compared to offenders who did not meet the criteria for psychopathy. Additionally, offenders with the <b>highest</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> psychopathy were found to have similar <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> FA to non-offenders.|$|R

In addition, {{it is found that}} <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> efficiency results in <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> competition in the Chinese banking industry and <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> credit risk precede an increase in the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> competition.

5|$|Carménère {{favors a}} long growing season in {{moderate}} to warm climates. During harvest {{time and the}} winter period the vine fares poorly if it is introduced to <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> rain or irrigation water. This is particularly true in poor-soil plantings where the vine would need more water. Over-watering during this period accentuates the herbaceous and green pepper characteristics of the grape. The grape naturally develops <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> sugar before the tannins achieve ripeness. If grown in too hot a climate the resulting wine will have a high alcohol level and low balance.
