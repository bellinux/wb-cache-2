5|$|The {{discovery}} of spontaneous fission in reactor-bred plutonium due to contamination by plutonium-240 led Wigner to propose switching to breeding uranium-233 from thorium, but {{the challenge was}} met by the Los Alamos Laboratory developing an implosion-type nuclear weapon design. In October 1944, Creutz moved to Los Alamos, where he became a group leader responsible for <b>explosive</b> <b>lens</b> design verification and preliminary testing. Difficulties encountered in testing the lenses led {{to the construction of}} a special test area in Pajarito Canyon, and Creutz became responsible for testing there. As part of the preparation for the Trinity nuclear test, Creutz conducted a test detonation at Pajarito Canyon without nuclear material. This test brought bad news; it seemed to indicate that the Trinity test would fail. Hans Bethe worked through the night to assess the results, and was able to report that the results were consistent with a perfect explosion.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} of the high <b>explosive</b> <b>lens</b> (diagram item #6) is not shown in the Swedish drawing, but a standard lens made of fast and slow high explosives, as in Fat Man, would be much longer than the shape depicted. For a single high <b>explosive</b> <b>lens</b> to generate a concave wave that envelops an entire hemisphere, it must either be very long or {{the part of the}} wave on a direct line from the detonator to the pit must be slowed dramatically.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the more}} unusual {{isotopes}} found in trinitite, although by no means unique as it may also have formed during the Joe-1 test, which was a partial to complete Soviet replica of the Trinity/Fat Man design, is a barium neutron activation product, the barium in the Trinity device coming from the slow <b>explosive</b> <b>lens</b> employed in the device, known as Baratol.|$|E

25|$|To {{create the}} {{symmetrical}} implosion required to compress the plutonium to the required density, thirty-two explosive charges were simultaneously detonated around the spherical core. Using conventional explosive techniques with blasting caps, progress towards achieving simultaneity {{to within a}} small fraction of a microsecond was discouraging. Alvarez directed Johnston to use a large capacitor to deliver a high voltage charge directly to each <b>explosive</b> <b>lens,</b> replacing blasting caps with exploding-bridgewire detonators. This detonated all thirty-two charges within a few tenths of a microsecond. The invention was {{critical to the success of}} the implosion-type nuclear weapon. Johnston was awarded US Patent 3,040,660 for the exploding-bridgewire detonator.|$|E
25|$|An {{implosion}} {{shock wave}} {{might be of}} such short duration that {{only part of the}} pit is compressed at any instant as the wave passes through it. To prevent this, a pusher shell may be needed. The pusher is located between the <b>explosive</b> <b>lens</b> and the tamper. It works by reflecting some of the shock wave backwards, thereby having the effect of lengthening its duration. It is made out of a low density metal—such as aluminium, beryllium, or an alloy of the two metals (aluminium is easier and safer to shape, and is two orders of magnitude cheaper; beryllium has high-neutron-reflective capability). Fat Man used an aluminium pusher.|$|E
500|$|To {{keep the}} design {{as simple as}} possible, a near solid spherical core was chosen rather than a hollow one, {{although}} calculations showed that a hollow core would be more efficient in its use of plutonium. The core was compressed to prompt super-criticality by the implosion generated by the high <b>explosive</b> <b>lens.</b> This design became known as a [...] "Christy Core" [...] or [...] "Christy pit" [...] after physicist Robert F. Christy, who made the solid pit design a reality after it was initially proposed by Edward Teller. Along with the pit, the whole physics package was also informally nicknamed [...] "Christy Gadget".|$|E
25|$|The <b>explosive</b> <b>lenses</b> {{required}} by the Fat Man had to be fabricated. A small explosive plant was established at Los Alamos known as Site S, {{as it was a}} former sawmill. Groves was appalled at the work practices and safety at Site S, and considered it {{only a matter of time}} before it blew up. Graves expressed his concerns about Site S to Captain William S. (Deak) Parsons, a Navy officer who was in charge of O (for ordnance) Division at Los Alamos. Parsons recommended establishing another explosives plant. While Site S had the capacity to produce enough <b>explosive</b> <b>lenses</b> for one or two bombs per month, more might be required.|$|R

Apart from this, TBRL also develops explosives-based products for conventional military and civilian use.|$|R
5000|$|Many PBXes {{are safe}} to machine—to turn solid blocks into complex {{three-dimensional}} shapes. For example, a billet of PBX can, if necessary, be precisely shaped on a lathe or CNC machine.

500|$|Kistiakowsky was {{initially}} reluctant to come, [...] "partly because", he later explained, [...] "I didn't think the bomb {{would be ready}} in time and I was interested in helping to win the war". At Los Alamos, he began reorganizing the implosion effort. He introduced techniques such as photography and X-Rays to study the behavior of shaped charges. The former had been extensively employed by the ERL, while the latter had been described in papers by Tuck, who also suggested using three-dimensional <b>explosive</b> <b>lenses.</b> As with {{other aspects of the}} Manhattan Project, research into <b>explosive</b> <b>lenses</b> followed multiple lines of inquiry simultaneously because, as Kistiakowsky noted, it was [...] "impossible to predict which of these basic techniques will be the more successful." ...|$|R
50|$|In March 1990, customs {{officials}} at Heathrow Airport in London seized {{a case of}} military electrical capacitors - key components of triggers for <b>explosive</b> <b>lenses</b> - which was bound for Al Qa'qaa. The United States subsequently charged five people and two British companies with violations of export regulations.|$|R
5|$|A trial {{assembly}} of the Gadget without the active components or <b>explosive</b> <b>lenses</b> {{was carried out by}} the bomb assembly team headed by Norris Bradbury at Los Alamos on July 3. It was driven to Trinity and back. A set of <b>explosive</b> <b>lenses</b> arrived on July 7, followed by a second set on July 10. Each was examined by Bradbury and Kistiakowsky, and the best ones were selected for use. The remainder were handed over to Edward Creutz, who conducted a test detonation at Pajarito Canyon near Los Alamos without nuclear material. This test brought bad news: magnetic measurements of the simultaneity of the implosion seemed to indicate that the Trinity test would fail. Bethe worked through the night to assess the results, and reported that they were consistent with a perfect explosion.|$|R

50|$|An {{explosive}} lens—as used, for example, {{in nuclear}} weapons—is a highly specialized shaped charge. In general, it is a device composed of several explosive charges. These charges are arranged and formed {{with the intent}} to control the shape of the detonation wave passing through them. The <b>explosive</b> <b>lens</b> is conceptually similar to an optical lens, which focuses light waves. The charges that make up the <b>explosive</b> <b>lens</b> are chosen to have different rates of detonation. In order to convert a spherically expanding wavefront into a spherically converging one using only a single boundary between the constituent explosives, the boundary shape must be a paraboloid; similarly, to convert a spherically diverging front into a flat one, the boundary shape must be a hyperboloid, and so on. Several boundaries can be used to reduce aberrations (deviations from intended shape) of the final wavefront.|$|E
5000|$|All retired W56 warheads were stored, to be finally {{dismantled}} {{by the end}} of June 2006. [...] One warhead {{which had}} high-performance but highly sensitive PBX in its <b>explosive</b> <b>lenses</b> is reported to nearly have detonated in 2005 when an unsafe amount of pressure was applied to the explosive while it was being disassembled.|$|R
5|$|Instead of the {{seafaring}} assignment {{he hoped}} for, Reynolds {{was sent to}} the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory to assist George Kistiakowsky {{in the design of the}} <b>explosive</b> <b>lenses</b> required by the implosion-type nuclear weapon. In April 1944, Kistiakowsky named Reynolds as one of eleven men that he would like to have working for him at Los Alamos.|$|R
5|$|While George Kistiakowsky's Explosives Division (X Division) {{developed}} the <b>explosive</b> <b>lenses,</b> G Division designed {{the rest of}} the weapon.

5000|$|The EBW {{was invented}} by Luis Alvarez and Lawrence Johnston for the Fat Man-type bombs of the Manhattan Project, during their work in Los Alamos National Laboratory. The Fat Man Model 1773 EBW {{detonators}} used an unusual, high reliability detonator system with two EBW [...] "horns" [...] attached to a single booster charge, which then fired each of the 32 <b>explosive</b> <b>lens</b> units.|$|E
50|$|Historians can use {{accidental}} {{neutron activation}} to authenticate atomic artifacts and materials subjected to neutron fluxes from fission incidents. For example, {{one of the}} fairly unique isotopes found in trinitite, and therefore with its absence likely signifying a fake sample of the mineral, is a barium neutron activation product, the barium in the Trinity device coming from the slow <b>explosive</b> <b>lens</b> employed in the device, known as Baratol.|$|E

5000|$|Composition B, colloquially [...] "Comp B", is an {{explosive}} consisting of castable mixtures of RDX and TNT. It {{is used as}} the main explosive filling in artillery projectiles, rockets, land mines, hand grenades and various other munitions. [...] It was also used for the <b>explosive</b> <b>lenses</b> in the first implosion-type nuclear weapons developed by the United States.|$|R
5000|$|The W53 warhead of the B53 used oralloy (highly enriched uranium) {{instead of}} {{plutonium}} for fission, {{with a mix}} of lithium-6 deuteride fuel for fusion. The <b>explosive</b> <b>lens</b> comprised a mixture of RDX and TNT, which was not insensitive. Two variants were made: the B53-Y1, a [...] "dirty" [...] weapon using a U-238-encased secondary, and the B53-Y2 [...] "clean" [...] version with a non-fissile (lead or tungsten) secondary casing. Explosive yield was approximately nine megatons.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to being easier to manufacture, the Mark 4 introduced the concept of in flight insertion (IFI), a weapons safety concept which was used {{for a number of}} years. An IFI bomb has either manual or mechanical assembly, which keeps the nuclear core stored outside the bomb until close {{to the point that it}} may be dropped. To arm the bomb, the fissile nuclear materials are inserted into the bomb core through a removable segment of the <b>explosive</b> <b>lens</b> assembly, which is then replaced and the weapon closed and armed.|$|E
5000|$|The RDS-2 {{bomb was}} the {{successor}} to the RDS-1 bomb, but the RDS-1 atomic weapon relied heavily {{on the design of}} Fat Man. However, after the first successful test at KB-11, Russian developers quickly shifted to making improvements to the weapon. Their efforts focused on increasing the bomb’s efficiency, yield, and reducing the size and weight. [...] RDS-2 was successfully tested on September 24, 1951 at KB-11. The major improvement to the bomb was a redesigned <b>explosive</b> <b>lens</b> system that allowed the designers to double the yield of RDS-1 and reduce its size and weight.|$|E
500|$|With {{the work}} in Chicago winding down in mid-1944, Morrison moved to the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico as a group leader. His first task was to help {{determine}} how much plutonium a bomb would require. He calculated that [...] would be sufficient. He then worked with George Kistiakowsky on the <b>explosive</b> <b>lenses</b> required to detonate the implosion-type nuclear weapon.|$|R
50|$|Baratol, {{which has}} a {{detonation}} velocity of only about 4,900 metres per second, {{was used as the}} slow-detonating explosive in the <b>explosive</b> <b>lenses</b> of some early atomic bombs, with Composition B often used as the fast-detonating component. Atomic bombs detonated at Trinity in 1945, the Soviet Joe 1 in 1949, and in India in 1972 all used Baratol and Composition B.|$|R
50|$|Sensitivity is an {{important}} consideration in selecting an explosive for a particular purpose. The explosive in an armor-piercing projectile must be relatively insensitive, or the shock of impact would cause it to detonate before it penetrated to the point desired. The <b>explosive</b> <b>lenses</b> around nuclear charges {{are also designed to}} be highly insensitive, to minimize the risk of accidental detonation.|$|R
