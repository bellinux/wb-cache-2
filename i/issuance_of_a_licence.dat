40|$|AbstractThe {{concept of}} “fairness” is {{introduced}} and {{its position in}} the ethical systems of rights and virtues outlined. The application of such thinkings to the worlds of vaccines and vaccination is then examined in some detail. This domain stretches from the inception of the idea of a need for a prophylactic measure to counter a historic or modern disease, beit caused by an infectious or a non-infectious agent. At each stage of this process a view is taken as to the issues that arise from fair or unfair behaviours. This leads to conclusions that focus on the way we regulate the <b>issuance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>licence</b> to manufacture and sell a vaccine in addition to the emphasising the need to focus on immunogens that are both universal and cross-protective with regard to their being able to counter the disease causing properties of pathogens that can “change their outer surfaces”.
