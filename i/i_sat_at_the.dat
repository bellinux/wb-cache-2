2500|$|In 1876, Anna {{visited the}} Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia where she saw {{an exhibit of}} {{educational}} blocks created by Friedrich Wilhelm August Fröbel. The blocks, known as Froebel Gifts, were the foundation of his innovative kindergarten curriculum. Anna, a trained teacher, was excited by the program and bought a set with which young Wright spent much time playing. The blocks in the set were geometrically shaped and could be assembled in various combinations to form three-dimensional compositions. In his autobiography, Wright described the influence of these exercises on his approach to design: [...] "For several years <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> little Kindergarten table-top… and played… with the cube, the sphere and the triangle—these smooth wooden maple blocks… All are in my fingers to this day… [...] " [...] Many of Wright's buildings are notable for their geometrical clarity.|$|E

6000|$|He {{swallowed}} {{some wine}} {{and then sat}} up, leaning against me as <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the stairs, quite himself again, and assuring {{us that he was}} not hurt; Perrault never touched him--"Threatened you, then," [...] said Fulk.|$|E

6000|$|I conned old times; <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> {{studying}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> feet of {{the great}} masters: Now, if eligible, O that the great masters might return and study me! ...|$|R
60|$|On {{the third}} morning, at break of day, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{steering}} oar, {{an hour or}} two previous having relieved Jarl, now fast asleep. Somehow, and suddenly, a sense of peril so intense, came over me, that it could hardly have been aggravated by the completest solitude.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed I have, Crocker." [...] That {{glass of}} hot whiskey-and-water, though it {{enhanced}} the melancholy tenderness {{of the young}} man, robbed him of his bashfulness, and loosened the strings of his tongue. [...] "For three years! And {{there was a time}} when she worshipped the very stool on which <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> office. I don't like to boast." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had to meet}} my wife, {{and break}} the news, and give her hope that the child would soon be found. All this I did, - with some appearance, I suppose, of being sincere, for I was the object of no suspicion. This done, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bedroom window all day long, and watched {{the spot where the}} dreadful secret lay.|$|E
6000|$|I conn'd old times, [...] <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> {{studying}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> feet of {{the great}} masters, [...] Now if eligible O that the great masters might return and study me.|$|R
60|$|And {{no longer}} master of myself, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> table and hid my face, shaken by great sobs, {{to think that}} this was my return for his kindness.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> up, and <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{rustle of}} my motion {{he looked at}} me quickly.|$|R
60|$|I {{went to the}} window. I {{opened it}} and let the cold wintry air blow over my burning head. I don't know how long <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> window. There came a time when I saw Rothsay on the house steps. He walked rapidly toward the park gate. His head was down; he never once {{looked back at the}} room in which he had left me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{repeated}} the medicines I had given her, and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{side of the}} bed until the night was far advanced. She never abated the piercing quality of her shrieks, never stumbled in the distinctness or the order of her words. They were always 'My husband, my father, and my brother! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. Hush!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then I {{let myself}} in, made myself some tea, {{and tried to}} think it out. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> drawing-room window looking on to the garden, which still glowed with the last full evening light. But I was too distracted and dreamy to look at the lawns and flower-pots and flower-beds with any concentration. So I took the shock the more sharply because I'd seen it so slowly.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to build a cathedral one of these days," [...] said I to my wife, as <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> slant line of light made by the {{afternoon}} sun on our picture of the Cathedral of Milan.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought he}} had a good heart," [...] said my mother, softly, to me, looking over to Uncle Chipperton, who was telling my father, for the second time, just how I looked, as <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> alone <b>at</b> <b>the</b> long table.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> window, where I {{could just}} discover, {{here and there}} between the trees, the glimmer of {{the waters of the}} lake. I thought to myself: [...] "Thus far my mortal journey has brought me. Why not end it here?" ...|$|R
60|$|Indeed, it was {{a morning}} for {{thoughtful}} meditation; and as <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> feet of the four granite kings shortly after, waiting for {{the gate of the}} ducal palace to be opened, that I might see the girls drawing the water, I studied the group of the Judgment of Solomon, {{on the corner of the}} palace, and arrived at an entirely new interpretation of that Bible story, which I have now wholly forgotten.|$|E
60|$|It {{must have}} been two years afterwards, and I was almost fourteen, when one dreadful night my godmother and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fireside. I was reading aloud, and she was listening. I had come down at nine o'clock as I always did to read the Bible to her, and was reading from St. John how our Saviour stooped down, writing with his finger in the dust, when they brought the sinful woman to him.|$|E
6000|$|The boats {{used by the}} Army {{were all}} alike, made by the mile and sawed off. They were flat-boats, and their lines were rectangles. Each boat was six feet wide, ten feet long, and {{a foot and a}} half deep. Thus, when our two boats were hooked together, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> stern {{steering}} a craft twenty feet long, containing twenty husky hoboes who [...] "spelled" [...] each other at the oars and paddles, and loaded with blankets, cooking outfit, and our own private commissary.|$|E
60|$|Laura and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> silent <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{table for}} {{a quarter of an hour}} or more, {{wondering}} uneasily what had happened, and waiting for the chance of Sir Percival's speedy return. There were no signs of his return, and we rose to leave the room.|$|R
60|$|I {{began in}} that dexterous, insinuating manner of which I am truly proud. I thought madame was ill. Ah, no. A change, then, {{was all that}} was required. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> piano and sang. In a few minutes madame retired. I was alone with my friend.|$|R
60|$|May 5.--A moist rainy day, mild, however, and {{promising}} good weather. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> my desk <b>the</b> whole day, {{and worked at}} Gillies's review. So was the day exhausted.|$|R
60|$|One February night--I {{remember}} it well--there came a voice near Miss Marchmont's house, heard by every inmate, but translated, perhaps, only by one. After a calm winter, storms were ushering in the spring. I had put Miss Marchmont to bed; <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fireside sewing. The wind was wailing at the windows; it had wailed all day; but, as night deepened, {{it took a}} new tone--an accent keen, piercing, almost articulate to the ear; a plaint, piteous and disconsolate to the nerves, trilled in every gust.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{very far}} from the Chilcat to the Skoot, and we were many days in the canoes. And the while the men bent to the paddles, <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> feet of Ligoun and {{received}} the Law. Of small need {{for me to say}} the Law, O Hair-Face, for it be known to me that in this thou art well skilled. Yet do I speak of the Law of blood for blood, and rank for rank. Also did Ligoun go deeper into the matter, saying:-- ...|$|E
60|$|I {{got out of}} bed {{and wandered}} about. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> window and stared at the immensity of space. Between the stars was the void, the unfathomable darkness! I tried to recall the fragmentary {{knowledge}} of astronomy I had gained in my irregular reading, but it was all too vague to furnish any idea of the things we might expect. At last I got back to bed and snatched some moments of sleep--moments of nightmare rather--in which I fell and fell and fell for evermore into the abyss of the sky.|$|E
60|$|The camps on <b>the</b> hills <b>at</b> night swarmed {{with men}} in hot debate. The {{majority}} believed the camps to be a failure, and loud discussions resounded from the trees as partner and <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> supper. <b>The</b> town-site men were very nervous. The camps were decreasing in population, and the tone was one of general foreboding.|$|R
60|$|And I remembered back to {{my young}} days when <b>I</b> had <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> feet of Arius, {{who had been a}} presbyter of the city of Alexandria, and who had been robbed of the bishopric by the blasphemous and heretical Alexander. Alexander the Sabellianite, that is what he was, and his feet had fast hold of hell.|$|R
60|$|She was pleased, but answered, 'Tut, Trot; MY old bones {{would have}} kept till tomorrow!' and softly patted my hand again, as <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> looking thoughtfully <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fire.|$|R
60|$|My anxiety {{relieved}} {{as regards}} Inez, I {{returned to my}} own quarters. Not feeling inclined for slumber, however, instead of turning in <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> doorway contemplating {{the beauty of the}} night while I watched the countless fireflies that seemed to dust the air with sparks of burning gold; also the great owls and other fowl that haunt the dark. These had come out in numbers from their hiding-places among the ruins and sailed to and fro like white-winged spirits, now seen and now lost in the gloom.|$|E
60|$|The saffron rays of {{the declining}} {{sunlight}} filtered through the cornstalks in Micajah Widdup's garden-patch, and cast an amber glory upon my paste-pot. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> editorial desk in my non-rotary revolving chair, and prepared my editorial against the oligarchies. The room, with its one window, was already a prey to the twilight. One by one, with my trenchant sentences, I lopped off {{the heads of the}} political hydra, while I listened, full of kindly peace, to the home-coming cow-bells and wondered what Mrs. Flanagan was going to have for supper.|$|E
6000|$|Waitukurau. [...] Twenty {{minutes for}} luncheon. With me sat {{my wife and}} daughter, and my manager, Mr. Carlyle Smythe. <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> head of the table, and could see the {{right-hand}} wall; the others had their backs to it. On that wall, at a good distance away, {{were a couple of}} framed pictures. I could not see them clearly, but from the groupings of the figures I fancied that they represented the killing of Napoleon III's son by the Zulus in South Africa. I broke into the conversation, which was about poetry and cabbage and art, and said to my wife-- ...|$|E
60|$|I leaned my head upon my hand; {{and felt}} more sorry and downcast, as <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fire, than I could have {{supposed}} possible {{so soon after}} the fulfilment of my brightest hopes. As <b>I</b> <b>sat</b> thinking, <b>I</b> happened to meet my aunt's eyes, which were resting on my face. There was an anxious expression in them, but it cleared directly.|$|R
5000|$|Sir Edmund Anderson (1530 [...] - [...] 1 August 1605), Chief Justice of the Common Pleas under Elizabeth <b>I,</b> <b>sat</b> {{as judge}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> trial of Mary, Queen of Scots.|$|R
