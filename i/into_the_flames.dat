5|$|As an example, the {{execution}} scene in The Kingdom of This World puts European and autochthonous cultures in opposition {{through the use}} of the spectator-performer relationship. In this spectacle situation, Carpentier is able to juxtapose the Europeans' experience of Macandal's body falling <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>flames</b> with the autochthonous (Afro-Haitian) experience of Macandal's body flying off the stake. Through the different, mutable views of the performance that he creates, Carpentier is able to represent an unstable cultural identity. As a second example, the scene that Ti Noel constructs around himself after the sacking of the Sans-Souci Palace presents the reader with a dramatic rehearsal in which Ti Noel represents culturally mobile subjectivity by performing different identities on his own.|$|E
5|$|Gilly and Steph {{take a walk}} {{round the}} village on bonfire night where she finally admits she's scared of dying, they have a heart to heart {{conversation}} where she realises she's it is how {{she is going to}} die that scares her. When the pair see restaurant Il Gnosh on fire, Gilly rings for help whilst Steph runs into the burning building to save Amy Barnes (Ashley Slanina-Davies) and her children. Gilly stands on a ladder outside and begs her to come out, however she tells him she's ready to die and walks back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>flames.</b> Gilly deals with his grief by becoming angry that Steph has 'left' him. After Rhys tries to comfort him, Gilly goes into Steph's room and trashes it after seeing that she has still kept her photo of her and Max Cunningham (Matt Littler) on their wedding day, placed on a table. Gilly argues with Steph's family as they blame him for not saving her and disagree on the funeral arrangements. Frankie then tells him that Steph had never loved him and that Max would have done anything to save Steph from the fire, making him further deeply upset and angry. He starts drinking heavily, causing trouble on many occasions.|$|E
5|$|After {{four minutes}} of deliberation, the jury's foreman {{announced}} a guilty verdict and {{a sentence of}} death. The trial lasted about one hour. Court officers approached Washington to escort him away, but were pushed aside by a surge of spectators, who seized Washington and dragged him outside. Washington initially fought back, biting one man, but was soon beaten. A chain was placed {{around his neck and}} he was dragged toward city hall by a growing mob; on the way downtown, he was stripped, stabbed, and repeatedly beaten with blunt objects. By the time he arrived at city hall, a group had prepared wood for a bonfire next to a tree in front of the building. Washington, semiconscious and covered in blood, was doused with oil, hung from the tree by a chain, and then lowered to the ground. Members of the crowd cut off his fingers, toes, and genitals. The fire was lit and Washington was repeatedly raised and lowered <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>flames</b> until he burned to death. German scholar Manfred Berg posits that the executioners attempted to keep him alive to increase his suffering. Washington attempted to climb the chain, but was unable to, owing to his lack of fingers. The fire was extinguished after two hours, allowing bystanders to collect souvenirs from the site of the lynching, including Washington's bones and links of the chain. One attendee kept part of Washington's genitalia; a group of children snapped the teeth out of Washington's head to sell as souvenirs. By the time that the fire was extinguished, parts of Washington's arms and legs had been burned off and his torso and head were charred. His body was removed from the tree and dragged behind a horse throughout the town. Washington's remains were transported to Robinson, where they were publicly displayed until a constable obtained the body late in the day and buried it.|$|E

50|$|Each of the Shadowlords {{represents}} {{the antithesis of}} one of the three guiding principles: Faulinei, the Shadowlord of Falsehood opposes Truth; Astaroth, the Shadowlord of Hatred opposes Love; and Nosfentor, the Shadowlord of Cowardice opposes Courage. The Shadowlords must be defeated, but this cannot be accomplished through pure combat. First, the player must learn each Shadowlord's name by interviewing NPCs, Second, the three shards of the Gem of Immortality must be recovered from their scattered locations in the Underworld. Finally, the player must visit each of <b>the</b> sacred <b>flames</b> (<b>the</b> <b>Flame</b> of Truth at <b>the</b> Lycaeum, <b>the</b> <b>Flame</b> of Love at Empath Abbey, and <b>the</b> <b>Flame</b> of Courage at Serpent's Hold), summon the corresponding Shadowlord by shouting its name, lure <b>the</b> Shadowlord <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> and finally destroy the shard by throwing it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame.</b>|$|R
50|$|Candle wicks are {{normally}} {{made out of}} braided cotton. Wicks are sometimes braided flat, so that as they burn they also curl back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame,</b> thus making them self-consuming.

5000|$|The {{contexts}} for diffusion {{may vary}} somewhat. For instance, a candle uses {{the heat of}} <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> itself to vaporize its wax fuel and the oxidizer (oxygen) diffuses <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> from <b>the</b> surrounding air, while a gaslight <b>flame</b> (or <b>the</b> safety <b>flame</b> of a bunsen burner) uses fuel already {{in the form of}} a vapor.|$|R

A third tire burst and the DC-10's left landing gear collapsed, causing a fuel tank to rupture. Following the aborted takeoff, spilled fuel ignited and enveloped the center {{portion of the}} aircraft in flames. During the ensuing emergency evacuation, {{a husband and wife}} died when they exited the passenger cabin onto the wing and dropped down directly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>flames.</b> Two additional passengers died of their injuries approximately three months after the accident; 74 others aboard the plane were injured, as were 11 firemen battling the fire.|$|E
25|$|In this performance, Abramović {{sought to}} re-evoke {{the energy of}} extreme bodily pain, using a large petroleum-drenched star, which the artist lit on fire {{at the start of}} the performance. Standing outside the star, Abramović cut her nails, toenails, and hair. When {{finished}} with each, she threw the clippings <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>flames,</b> creating a burst of light each time. Burning the communist five-pointed star represented a physical and mental purification, while also addressing the political traditions of her past. In the final act of purification, Abramović leapt across the flames, propelling herself into the center of the large star. Due to the light and smoke given off by the fire, the observing audience did not realize that, once inside the star, the artist had lost consciousness from lack of oxygen. Some members of the audience realized what had occurred only when the flames came very near to her body and she remained inert. A doctor and several members of the audience intervened and extricated her from the star.|$|E
25|$|Floo powder can be {{used with}} any {{fireplace}} connected to the Floo Network. To transport from one to another, the fire at the point of departure must first be lit. The traveler throws a handful of Floo powder <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>flames,</b> turning them emerald green, then steps into the fireplace and states the intended destination in a clear and purposeful voice. Floo powder can also be used for communication; a wizard or witch can kneel {{in front of the fireplace}} and stick their head into the fire, which will then appear in the fire of the destination fireplace, leaving the witch or wizard free to talk. It is also known that other body parts may be transported via Floo Powder, as Umbridge almost catches Sirius the second time he converses with Harry through the Floo network. Voices can also be transmitted through the Floo Network, as seen in the Prisoner of Azkaban by Snape, who summons Lupin through his office's fireplace while interrogating Harry about the Marauder's Map.|$|E

50|$|The {{solution}} containing the relevant substance to be analysed is drawn <b>into</b> <b>the</b> burner and dispersed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> {{as a fine}} spray. The solvent evaporates first, leaving finely divided solid particles which move to the hottest region of <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> where gaseous atoms and ions are produced. Here electrons are excited as described above. It is common for a monochromator {{to be used to}} allow for easy detection.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the fuel}} in a <b>flame</b> combusts, <b>the</b> energy {{released}} by the combustion process is deposited in combustion products, usually molecular fragments called free radicals. The combustion products are excited to a very high temperature called <b>the</b> adiabatic <b>flame</b> temperature (that is, the temperature before any heat has been transferred away from the combustion products). This temperature is usually {{much higher than the}} temperature of the air in <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> or which an object inserted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> can reach. When the combustion products lose this energy by radiative emission, the radiation can thus be more intense than that of a lower temperature blackbody which has merely been inserted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame.</b> <b>The</b> exact emission process involved varies with the material, the type of fuels and oxidizers, and <b>the</b> type of <b>flame,</b> though in many cases it is well established that the free radicals undergo radiative recombination. This energetic light emitted directly from the combustion products may be observed directly (as with a blue gas <b>flame),</b> depending on <b>the</b> wavelength, or it may then cause fluorescence in the candoluminescent material. Some free radical recombinations emit ultraviolet light, which is only observable through fluorescence.|$|R

He was carried <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>flames,</b> upon which the wind changed direction, thus saving the building. Bede praised Mellitus' sane mind, but other than the miracle, little happened during his time as archbishop. [...] Bede also mentioned that Mellitus suffered from gout. Boniface wrote to Mellitus encouraging him in the mission, perhaps prompted by the marriage of Æthelburh of Kent to King Edwin of Northumbria. Whether Mellitus received a pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority, from the pope is unknown.|$|E

40|$|In this study, the {{stability}} and the light emittance of non-premixed propane-oxygen flames have been experimentally evaluated with respect to swirling oxidizer flow and variations in fuel nozzle diameter. Hence, three types of the vanes with the swirl angles of 30 °, 45 °, and 60 ° have been chosen for producing the desired swirling flows. The main aims {{of this study are}} to determine <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> behaviour, light emittance, and also considering the effect of variation in fuel nozzle diameter on combustion phenomena such as flame length, flame shape, and soot free length parameter. <b>The</b> investigation <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> phenomenology was comprised of variations of the oxidizer and fuel flow velocities (respective Reynolds numbers) and the fuel nozzle diameter. The results showed that the swirl effect could change <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> luminosity and this way could reduce or increase the maximum value of <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> light emittance in the combustion zone. Therefore, investigation <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> light emittance can give a good clue for studying the mixing quality of reactants, <b>the</b> <b>flame</b> phenomenology (blue flame or sooty flame, localized extinction), and the combustion intensity in non-premixed flames...|$|R
500|$|Some Chinese died on {{the banks}} of Bitter Creek as they fled, others near the {{railroad}} bridge as they attempted to escape Chinatown. The rioters threw Chinese bodies <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>flames</b> of burning buildings. Other Chinese immigrants, who had hidden in their houses instead of fleeing, were murdered, and then their bodies were burned with their houses. Those who could not run, including the sick, were burned alive in their camp houses. Many of the Chinese who were burned in their houses apparently tried [...] "to dig a hole in the cellar to hide themselves. But the fire overtook them when about half way in the hole, burning their lower limbs to a crisp and leaving the upper trunk untouched." [...] One remaining Chinese immigrant was found dead in a laundry house in Whitemen's Town, his home demolished by rioters.|$|E
500|$|In {{her final}} soliloquy, Brünnhilde thanks the Rhinemaidens for their [...] "good advice". They have {{apparently}} {{told her the}} full story of Siegfried's ensnarement and betrayal, and advised that only {{the return of the}} ring to the waters of the Rhine can lift its curse. Brünnhilde sings: [...] "What you desire I will give you: from my ashes take it to yourselves. The fire...will cleanse the curse from the ring". She exhorts the Rhinemaidens to [...] "carefully guard it" [...] in the future, then leaps <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>flames</b> of Siegfried's pyre. The fire blazes up to fill the stage, representing the destruction of the gods. As the Rhine overflows its banks the Rhinemaidens appear, making for the ring. Hagen, who covets the ring, shouts to them [...] "Get back from the ring!" [...] (Zurück vom Ring!), the last words of the drama. He is seized by Woglinde and Wellgunde and dragged into the Rhine's depths, as Flosshilde grabs the ring, holds it aloft, and joins her sisters [...] swimming in circles as the waters of the Rhine [...] gradually subside.|$|E

As Gilly runs for help, Steph hears Amy Barnes (Ashley Slanina-Davies) crying for help from a flat above Il Gnosh, so runs inside to help. Mercedes tries to stop her from going into the burning building but Steph ignores her. After rescuing Amy and her children, Leah and Lucas, Gilly calls to Steph to get out, but she refuses, saying she is now ready to die as she walks back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>flames.</b> Later, Gilly attempts to re-enter the flat, but is stopped by a fireman, who confirms Steph's death. The next day, Steph's family apart from Gilly watch her goodbye message. After Steph's funeral, Lee shows {{her family and friends}} individual films that Steph had recorded for all of them. However, she died before she could film Frankie's. On 11 March 2011, Cindy returns and Darren tells her about Steph and plays her the goodbye message. On 26 December, Steph made a one-off appearance as a ghost to Doug Carter (PJ Brennan).|$|E
