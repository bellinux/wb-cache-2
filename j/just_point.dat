6000|$|CYPRIAN: But for {{a purpose}} thus {{subordinate}} He might have employed Genii, good or evil,-- A sort of spirits called so by the learned, Who roam about inspiring good or evil, And from whose influence and existence we [...] 170 May well infer our immortality.

If they do {{something}} silly and you <b>just</b> <b>point</b> it out to them, then {{there is always a}} reason for it that you wouldn't understand. Oh, yes! And if you make just the slightest mistake, like what is natural to all of us, that is because you are wicked and unfeeling and don't want to be anything else." ...|$|E

"And I've succeeded {{beyond my}} hopes, for here you are, a steady, {{sensible}} businessman, doing heaps of good with your money, and laying up {{the blessings of}} the poor, instead of dollars. But you are not merely a businessman, you love good and beautiful things, enjoy them yourself, and let others go halves, as you always did in the old times. I am proud of you, Teddy, for you get better every year, and everyone feels it, though you won't let them say so.

6000|$|... 68. A {{difficult}} balance, indeed, {{for us to}} hold, if it {{were left}} merely to our skill to poise; but the <b>just</b> <b>point</b> between poverty and profusion has been fixed for us accurately by the wise laws of Providence. If you carefully watch for all the genius you can detect, apply it to good service, and then reverently preserve what it produces, you will never have too little art; and if, on the other hand, you never force an artist to work hurriedly, for daily bread, nor imperfectly, because you would rather have showy works than complete ones, you will never have too much. Do not force the multiplication of art, and you will not have it too cheap; do not wantonly destroy it, and you will not have it too dear.|$|E
6000|$|A careful perusal of the {{biographies of}} great {{men of the}} dynamic type leads one to the {{conclusion}} that much of their success is due to an assiduous improvement of every opportunity,--and Mr. Humphrey Crewe certainly possessed this quality, also. He is in the Pelican Hotel this evening, meeting the men that count. Mr. Job Braden, who had come down with the idea that he might be of use in introducing the new member from Leith to the notables, was met by this remark:--"You can't introduce me to any of 'em--they all know who I am. <b>Just</b> <b>point</b> any of 'em out you think I ought to know, and I'll go up and talk to 'em.

60|$|Many {{things more}} might be {{observed}} on this curious head of our author's speculations. But, taking leave {{of what the}} writer says in his serious part, if he be serious in any part, I shall only <b>just</b> <b>point</b> {{out a piece of}} his pleasantry. No man, I believe, ever denied that the time for making peace is that in which the best terms maybe obtained. But what that time is, together with the use that has been made of it, we are to judge by seeing whether terms adequate to our advantages, and to our necessities, have been actually obtained. Here is the pinch of the question, to which the author ought to have set his shoulders in earnest. Instead of doing this, he slips out of the harness by a jest; and sneeringly tells us, that, to determine this point, we must know the secrets of the French and Spanish cabinets[55], and that Parliament was pleased to approve the treaty of peace without calling for the correspondence concerning it. How just this sarcasm on that Parliament may be, I say not; but how becoming in the author, I leave it to his friends to determine.|$|E
60|$|Without bragging at all, let us <b>just</b> <b>point</b> out {{the chief}} {{claims of the}} above {{pleasing}} piece of composition. In the first place, it is perfectly stilted and unnatural; the dialogue and the sentiments being artfully arranged, {{so as to be}} as strong and majestic as possible. Our dear Cat is but a poor illiterate country wench, who has come from cutting her husband's throat; and yet, see! she talks and looks like a tragedy princess, who is suffering in the most virtuous blank verse. This is the proper end of fiction, and one of the greatest triumphs that a novelist can achieve: for to make people sympathise with virtue is a vulgar trick that any common fellow can do; but it is not everybody who can take a scoundrel, and cause us to weep and whimper over him as though he were a very saint. Give a young lady of five years old a skein of silk and a brace of netting-needles, and she will in a short time turn you out a decent silk purse--anybody can; but try her with a sow's ear, and see whether she can make a silk purse out of THAT. That is the work for your real great artist; and pleasant it is to see how many have succeeded in these latter days.|$|E
5000|$|Wolves are nocturnal {{animals and}} thus can often be heard howling faced toward the sky, which gave humans the {{impression}} that they are actually crying directly at the moon.

50|$|After nine years, the first, {{historic}} {{champion of}} Poland, Cracovia, regained the title.

50|$|St Just is twinned with Huelgoat, Bro-Gernev, Brittany. The town is also twinned, in {{partnership}} with Penzance, with Bendigo in the State of Victoria, Australia and with Nevada City in California, USA {{as a result of}} the historical links through the many people from the area who emigrated to the two destinations, mostly in the late 19th century, to find a better life in the mines there. There is still an area of Bendigo known as St. <b>Just</b> <b>Point.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In November 2014, Klass caused {{controversy}} {{by engaging}} in a heated debate with then-leader of the Labour Party, Ed Miliband, on the ITV show The Agenda. Discussing his proposals for a so-called mansion tax on larger homes, Klass expressed the view that this would hit [...] "little grannies". In the course of discussion, {{she pointed to a}} glass of water, saying [...] "You can't <b>just</b> <b>point</b> at things and tax them."

5000|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{gave the}} episode a [...] "good" [...] 7.2 out of 10 and {{wrote in his}} verdict, [...] "Gotham crammed a lot into its quasi-penultimate Season 3 chapter as the show's sloppiness {{collided}} with its elevated endgame stakes. Jim and Lee went full Tetch virus, Bruce went full League, and the gas bomb went off {{in the middle of}} town. Honestly, there are no rules at this point (Alfred's allowed to <b>just</b> <b>point</b> guns at people and/or dangle them from rooftops) so I'm curious to see how next week's two-parter will try and convince us that there's an actual police force in the city." ...|$|E
50|$|VLSI's design tools {{included}} {{not only}} design entry and simulation but eventually also cell-based routing (chip compiler), a datapath compiler, SRAM and ROM compilers, {{and a state}} machine compiler. The tools were an integrated design solution for IC design and not <b>just</b> <b>point</b> tools, or more general purpose system tools. A designer could edit transistor-level polygons and/or logic schematics, then run DRC and LVS, extract parasitics from the layout and run Spice simulation, then back-annotate the timing or gate size changes into the logic schematic database. Characterization tools were integrated to generate FrameMaker Data Sheets for Libraries. VLSI eventually spun off the CAD and Library operation into Compass Design Automation but it never reached IPO before it was purchased by Avanti Corp.|$|E
