5|$|After being designated, the cyclone became disorganized, and {{contained}} little deep and persistent convection; with dry air infringing {{on the western}} edge of the storm, substantial intensification was deemed unlikely. Despite being sheared, the cyclone neared tropical storm status later that day, though it remained a depression due to a partially non-tropical appearance. Initially, the depression meandered towards the northeast due to weak steering currents, and it intensified into a tropical storm at 0600UTC. As such, it was named Hanna by the National Hurricane Center. Over the next 24hours, the low-level center rotated around the mid- and upper-level centers, and the entire tropical storm turned southwestward by late September12. After a <b>jog</b> to the northwest, the low-level center became separated from the convection. Meandering, the storm started to turn northward under the steering currents of a southwesterly flow associated with an approaching mid-level trough. Hanna then strengthened sharply to reach to its peak intensity of 60miles per hour (100km/h) at 0000UTC on September14.|$|E

40|$|This master thesis aims {{to create}} a deeper {{understanding}} of the conditions for <b>jogging</b> in the everyday landscape. It examines the structures that may support it, and how they can be created. Through a literature study, I examine what research says about the importance of urban planning in promoting <b>jogging,</b> as well as what supportive structures for <b>jogging</b> in the everyday landscape consist of. The conclusions of the literature are applied practically through analysis in the studied everyday landscape, Flemingsberg. Based on the literature study’s conclusions and the analysis results, I develop demands and thresholds for <b>jogging</b> which exemplifies a possible approach to achieve {{a deeper understanding of}} the landscape of <b>jogging.</b> Finally, I give a suggestion on how <b>jogging,</b> from a public health perspective, can be promoted in Flemingsberg. The study shows that supportive structures for <b>jogging,</b> such as <b>jogging</b> trails and exercise facilities, are important elements of the landscape of <b>jogging,</b> but should only be considered as a part of it. Since <b>jogging</b> often starts right at the front door the everyday landscape should be seen as its whole. In urban planning movement is usually seen as a functional form of displacement. To reach a holistic perspective and {{a deeper understanding of the}} landscape of <b>jogging</b> the activity needs to be treated as a mobility, where the experience of the movement is central. Physical activity in public space reflects societal norms and structures. A deeper understanding of the various needs and preferences for <b>jogging</b> require that specific audiences are defines and included in the planning of the everyday landscape. It also requires that public health research theory is translated into concrete requirements and thresholds of what is sufficient and necessary to promote physical activity and <b>jogging.</b> If these concrete requirements are then practically applied within urban planning, an understanding of the supportive structures for <b>jogging</b> in the everyday landscape can be fully reached.
