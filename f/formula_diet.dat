Pre- and post-interventional intracellular micronutrient status in buccal mucosa cells (BMC) was analyzed, as well as additional micronutrient serum concentrations in 14 of the subjects.

40|$|ABSTRACT Using new nonisotopic and isotopic methods, {{we showed}} {{previously}} that fatty acid synthesis was markedly stimulated in weight-stable normal volunteers by a very-low-fat <b>formula</b> <b>diet</b> with 10 % of energy as fat and 75 % as short glucose polymers. In this study, we determined whether fatty acid syn-thesis was equally stimulated by a very-low-fat solid diet made with foods consumed typically. Four normal volunteers con-sumed the same very-low-fat <b>formula</b> <b>diet</b> for 25 d {{and then an}} isoenergetic solid food diet with 10 % of energy as fat and 75 % as starch, simple sugars, and fiber for 25 d. To measure fatty acid synthesis, the fatty acid compositions of the diets were matched to the composition of each subject’s adipose tissue and compared with the composition of VLDL-triacylglycerol. In all subjects, the large increases in newly formed palmitate and decreases in linoleate in VLDL-triacylglycerol were quickly reversed by the solid food diet, and the fraction of de novo synthesized fatty acids in fasting VLDL-triacylglycerol decreased from 30 – 54 % to 0 – 1 %. In a second group of subjects, the stimulation of fatty acid synthesis by the <b>formula</b> <b>diet</b> with 75 % glucose polymers was similarly reduced by a <b>formula</b> <b>diet</b> with amounts of fat, starch, and sugar chosen to mimic those of the solid food diet, but per-sisted after the addition of fiber or a diet with 75 % sugar. In con-clusion, an increase in fatty acid synthesis and palmitate-rich, linoleate-poor VLDL-triacylglycerol induced by very-low-fat, high-sugar diets may be reduced by the substitution of dietary starch for sugar with potentially beneficial effects on cardiovas-cular health.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{amount of}} oxalate {{excreted}} in urine {{has a significant}} impact on calcium oxalate supersaturation and stone formation. Dietary oxalate is believed to make only a minor (10 to 20 %) contribution to the amount of oxalate excreted in urine, but the validity of the experimental observations that support this conclusion can be questioned. An understanding of the actual contribution of dietary oxalate to urinary oxalate excretion is important, as it is potentially modifiable. METHODS: We varied the amount of dietary oxalate consumed by a group of adult individuals using <b>formula</b> <b>diets</b> and controlled, solid-food diets with a known oxalate content, determined by a recently developed analytical procedure. Controlled solid-food diets were consumed containing 10, 50, and 250 mg of oxalate/ 2500 kcal, as well as <b>formula</b> <b>diets</b> containing 0 and 180 mg oxalate/ 2500 kcal. Changes in the content of oxalate and other ions were assessed in 24 -hour urine collections. RESULTS: Urinary oxalate excretion increased as dietary oxalate intake increased. With oxalate-containing diets, the mean contribution of dietary oxalate to urinary oxalate excretion ranged from 24. 4 +/- 15. 5 % on the 10 mg/ 2500 kcal/day diet to 41. 5 +/- 9. 1 % on the 250 mg/ 2500 kcal/day diet, much higher than previously estimated. When the calcium content of a diet containing 250 mg of oxalate was reduced from 1002 mg to 391 mg, urinary oxalate excretion increased by a mean of 28. 2 +/- 4. 8 %, and the mean dietary contribution increased to 52. 6 +/- 8. 6 %. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that dietary oxalate makes a much greater contribution to urinary oxalate excretion than previously recognized, that dietary calcium influences the bioavailability of ingested oxalate, and that the absorption of dietary oxalate may be an important factor in calcium oxalate stone formation...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Data are {{presented}} from several studies concerning {{the effect of}} varying protein intake on urinary calcium excretion, A markedly positive correlation was found between protein ingestion and calciunia. Although the response was not linear, varying protein intake from 0 g to 90 g N per day results in approximately an 800 % increase in calcium excretion, irrespective of calcium intake. This effect of protein occurred in all our studies of individuals, and was also observed with pure L-amino acid mixtures. Am. J. (‘lin. Nutr. 27 : 584 - 589, 1974. As early as 1920, Sherman (I) observed that adding meat to the diet caused a urinary calcium increase in man; a similar effect was later noted by others (2 - 6). The increase in protein intake, due to the addition of meat to the diet was considered primarily responsible for this calciuretic effect. McCance et al. (7) further showed that the calciuretic effect could be induced by supplementing the diet with peptone, gluten. gelatin, or egg white. In most of these reports, only a few subjects were studied, and many components of the diet, other than calcium, were not balanced at varying levels of protein intake. A number of dietary factors besides protein {{have been shown to}} significantly affect the urinary calcium excretion (8 - 11). The importance of these prior studies is, therefore, obscured because many dietary t’actors were not controlled. During the past few years. we have studied the metabolic responses to varying protein intake by using well-controlled <b>formula</b> <b>diets.</b> Because the effects of many dietary factors can be eliminated or minimized by these well-balanced <b>formula</b> <b>diets,</b> it is possible to make a critical evaluation of the effect of protein intake on urinary calcium excretion...|$|R

Two groups of rats were fed isocaloric amounts of DFD (73 kcal/day); group I: sham-operated, orally-fed: group 2 : operated, intragastrically-fed. Diets included: Vivonex (V), Flexical (F), Vital, Vivonex high nitrogen, and a control casein rat liquid <b>formula</b> <b>diet</b> (C). After 2 wk rats were killed and the liver, pancreas, and small bowel removed. The bowel was divided into eight equal segments. Mucosal weight, DNA, and protein concentration per cm segment were measured. Pancreatic amylase activity (units/g), and liver weight and lipid content were measured. Weight gain was comparable in all oral-fed groups, but was decreased in all gastric-fed animals compared to the oral-fed group. Nitrogen retention was not influenced by route of feeding but was significantly lower for Vivonex and Flexical animals (p < 0. 01) in both oral-fed and gastric-fed groups. There was significant accumulation of lipid in the liver of both oral-fed and gastric-fed animals sustained on Vivonex and Vivonex high nitrogen (p < 0. 01). Most proximal intestinal segment weight and mucosal weight, protein and DNA were decreased compared to the control diet in both oral-fed and gastric-fed animals. These studies demonstrate that while the gastrointestinal response to isocaloric defined formula diets was significantly influenced by the specific diet, fewer responses were modified by feeding defined formula diets orally versus gastrically.

Their energy expenditure was measured by open circuit indirect calorimetry. Nitrogen turnover and whole body protein synthesis and catabolism were determined using repeated oral administration of 15 N-glycine for 60 - 72 h followed by the analysis of 15 N-enrichment in urinary urea. These VLBW infants grew at an average rate of 15 g/kg. d. About half of the ME intake (i. e. 50 kcal/kg. d) was invested in weight gain while the remainder (i. e. 60 kcal/kg. d) was oxidised. The energy equivalent of the weight gain (i. e. {{the amount of energy}} stored per g weight gain) and the N balance indicated that lean tissue made up approximately 2 / 3 of the weight gained and fat tissue the remaining 1 / 3.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Despite {{provision}} of adequate calories, defined formula diets in rats lead to bacterial translocation (BT), fatty infiltration of the liver, {{and an increased}} susceptibility to endotoxin. These deleterious effects may be {{due in part to}} a loss of intestinal barrier integrity resulting from bowel atrophy. Defined formula diets lack both glutamine and fiber, substances which may help maintain intestinal mass. To determine whether supplementation of defined formula diets with either glutamine or fiber might prevent bowel atrophy and, thus, BT, hepatic steatosis, and the altered response to endotoxin, Wistar rats were fed (1) defined <b>formula</b> <b>diet</b> ad libitum (DFD), (2) (DFD + 2 % (w/v) glutamine, (GLUT), or (3) DFD + 2 % (w/ v) psyllium (FIBER). Rats given standard food isocalorically pair-fed to DFD were used as controls. Nutritional status was assessed by daily weight gain, as well as the ability to maintai...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Growth {{failure is}} the most common extraintes-tinal manifestation of Crohn’s disease in childhood, {{occurring}} in up to 50 % to 88 % of affected patients. Previous studies have shown malnutrition to be the most likely cause of the decrease in height and weight velocities in these children. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effect of an intermittent defined <b>formula</b> <b>diet</b> on growth and disease activity in children with Crohn’s disease and growth failure. Six Tanner stage I-II patients, mean age 13. 6 years with height less than the 5 th percentile or height velocity less than the 3 rd percentile were enrolled in a 1 -year prospective study. An isotonic, hydrolyzed whey, medium-chain triglyceride formula was given by noctur-nal nasogastric infusion at a caloric equivalent of 50 th percent-ile for age, as the exclusive nutrient source 1 out of 4 months during a 1 -year period. A 2 -week exclusion diet and a 2 -wee...|$|E

40|$|Composition of diet may {{influence}} growth, diseases, tumor rates, {{and responses to}} chemical treatment. Since 1980 the NIH- 07 open <b>formula</b> nonpurified <b>diet</b> has been the selected diet for the National Toxicology Program (NTP) toxicity and carcinogenicity studies in rodents. Studies with nonpurified experimental diets with lower protein and higher fat and fiber than the NIH- 07 diet indicated that the diet for Fischer- 344 (F 344) rats in long-term studies could be modified to decrease the severity of chronic diseases and to decrease/delay the development of spontaneous tumors. Based {{on the results of}} these studies a new open <b>formula</b> nonpurified <b>diet</b> designated as NTP- 2000 was formulated to contain — 14. 5 % pro-tein,- 8. 5 % fat, and- 9. 5 % fiber. Corn, wheat, and wheat mid-dlings contribute to about 60 % of the ingredients; soybean meal, fish meal, and alfalfa meal are the additional sources of protein; purified cellulose, oat hulls, and alfalfa meal are the major source...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Radioisotopic {{analyses}} for carnitine content were done on infant formula, for-mulas for tube feeding, food supplements, and chemically defined diets. The carnitine {{content of the}} diets depend on the protein source. Products whose main protein source is soy protein isolate, casein, or egg white solids contain 4 nmole carnitine per milliliter or less, with most of them containing undetectable amounts of carnitine. Products based on milk or beef contain SO to 656 nmole carnitine per milliliter. The daily requirement of the body for carnitine is unknown. Evidence is discussed that indicates that the possible use of carnitine {{as a supplement to}} <b>formula</b> <b>diets</b> intended for long-term care needs to be considered. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 32 : 2272 - 2276, 1979. A recent review article appearing in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition em-phasizes how little we know about the content of carnitine in foods and discusses the ques-tions “as to whether carnitine needs are in-deed met entirely by endogenous synthesis and what role, if any, dietary carnitine play...|$|R
