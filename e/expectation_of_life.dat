2500|$|In {{cases of}} victims who were unconscious, one must award {{not only for}} the [...] "loss of {{amenities}} and loss of <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> but also for pain and suffering". Such damages are awarded not as a matter of [...] "solace". This view comes close to that expressed by Lord Scarman in Lim Poh Choo v Camden and Islington Area Health Authority, difference being that an award must be [...] "made even for pain and suffering in case of unconscious plaintiffs". The reason for so doing is that it [...] "looks strange that wrongdoer whose negligence makes the victim unconscious is placed in a more advantageous position than one who inflicts a lesser injury which does not render the victim unconscious".|$|E

40|$|With today's lower {{mortality}} rates, longer <b>expectations</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> and {{new medical}} technologies, the nation's health policy focus {{has shifted from}} emphasis on individual survival to emphasis on personal health and independent living. Using longitudinal data sets and new methodological techniques, researchers have begun to assess active life expectancies, estimating not only how long a subpopulation can expect to live beyond each age, but what fractions of the expected remaining lifetime will be lived as independent, dependent, or institutionalized. New ideas are addressed, applying recently developed multistate life table methods to Waves One and Two of the Massachusetts Health Care Panel Study. <b>Expectations</b> <b>of</b> active <b>life</b> are presented for those 65 and older who initially are {{in one of two}} functional states of well-being. Included are <b>expectations</b> <b>of</b> <b>life,</b> for those, for example, who were independent and remained so, or those who were dependent and became independent.

60|$|In {{regard to}} the moral qualities, some {{elimination}} of the worst dispositions is always in progress {{even in the most}} civilised nations. Malefactors are executed, or imprisoned for long periods, so that they cannot freely transmit their bad qualities. Melancholic and insane persons are confined, or commit suicide. Violent and quarrelsome men often come to a bloody end. Restless men who will not follow any steady occupation—and this relic of barbarism is a great check to civilisation[236]—emigrate to newly-settled countries, where they prove useful pioneers. Intemperance is so highly destructive, that the <b>expectation</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> of the intemperate, at the age, for instance, of thirty, is only 13.8 years; whilst for the rural labourers of England at the same age it is 40·59 years.[237] Profligate women bear few children, and profligate men rarely marry; both suffer from disease. In the breeding of domestic animals, the elimination of those individuals, though few in number, which are in any marked manner inferior, is by no means an unimportant element towards success. This especially holds good with injurious characters which tend to reappear through reversion, such as blackness in sheep; and with mankind some of the worst dispositions, which occasionally without any assignable cause make their appearance in families, may perhaps be reversions to a savage state, from which we are not removed by very many generations. This view seems indeed recognised in the common expression that such men are the black sheep of the family.|$|E

Analysis on the z-score scale offers useful insights into the way mortality evolves over time.

Methods: This is a descriptive and exploratory study with a qualitative approach, in which the focal group technique was used. Data were analyzed according to the Collective Subject Discourse. Results: The research revealed the following central ideas: 1) The private world of shelter institutions; 2) Representation of family X care under the eyes of adolescents and 3) Perspectives, dreams and desires regarding the future. Conclusion: There is evidence of the need for new debates about the adolescents' experience of difficulties in relation to the universe they are facing...|$|R

The collection uses Miami as its setting due to the wide demographic range of its inhabitants, and the stories address themes of memory, love, sex, opportunity and privilege, the mayhem born of disinformation, and the anxiety of displacement. Each story in the collection describes a pivotal moment when the characters encounter a truth that had previously eluded them and then must deal with the repercussions of that knowledge...|$|R
