25|$|Early examples, {{and most}} {{used by the}} Navy, had an output that {{directly}} drove a Pilot <b>Direction</b> <b>Indicator</b> meter in the cockpit. This eliminated the need to manually signal the pilot, as well as eliminating the possibility of error.|$|E
25|$|A {{good example}} of its {{replacement}} was the refitting of the Doolittle Raiders with a simple iron sight. Designed by Capt. C. Ross Greening, the sight was mounted to the existing pilot <b>direction</b> <b>indicator,</b> allowing the bombardier to make corrections remotely, like the bombsights of an earlier era.|$|E

50|$|By {{the end of}} August 1933 all Morris {{cars had}} {{synchromesh}} four-speed gearboxes, dipping headlights, hydraulic shock absorbers, leather upholstery, hydraulic brakes, rear petrol tank, <b>direction</b> <b>indicators</b> and safety glass.

25|$|Although the CSBS {{and similar}} designs allowed the {{calculation}} of the proper flight angle needed to correct for windage, it was normally not visible to the pilot. In early bombers the bomb aimer was normally positioned {{in front of the}} pilot and could indicate corrections by hand signals, but as aircraft grew larger it became common for the pilot and bomb aimer to be separated. This led to the introduction of the pilot <b>direction</b> <b>indicator,</b> or PDI. These typically consisted of a pair of electrical pointers mounted in a conventional aircraft instrument panel mount (a small dial). The bombardier used switches to move the pointer on his unit, which was repeated in the cockpit in front of the pilot.|$|E
2500|$|In 1981 {{the airport}} had {{expanded}} {{from the original}} [...] to an area of [...] In 2006 the runway was turf and had dimensions of [...] The airport had a hangar and tie downs available for aircraft storage, as well as wind <b>direction</b> <b>indicator.</b> The runway was marked with yellow cones and barrels. Hazards at the airport included a soft landing strip [...] "during spring thaw", trees {{too close to the}} north side of the runway, and deer on the runway, especially at night.|$|E
2500|$|The spans and wing {{areas of}} the DH.9A and H.P.20 were about the same, so the wing chord of the {{monoplane}} was about double that of the biplane. As a result, the tailing edge extended aft beyond the DH.9A's pilot's cockpit and so the H.P.20 was flown from {{what had been the}} gunner's position. There was a small cut out in the trailing edge to enhance the pilot's view. As there was no upper wing to house the fuel, the H.P.20 had a slightly round-ended cylindrical tank mounted high over the centre section to provide gravity feed. [...] Because high angles of attack were used in landing and take off with the slots open, the undercarriage was lengthened, as it had been on the H.P.17. There was an airflow <b>direction</b> <b>indicator</b> mounted on a little boom which projected forward of the starboard wing.|$|E

50|$|More modern {{aviation}} ADFs {{contain a}} small array of fixed aerials and use electronic sensors to deduce the direction using {{the strength and}} phase of the signals from each aerial. The electronic sensors listen for the trough that occurs when the antenna is {{at right angles to}} the signal, and provide the heading to the station using a <b>direction</b> <b>indicator.</b> In flight, the ADF's RMI or <b>direction</b> <b>indicator</b> will always point to the broadcast station regardless of aircraft heading, however a banked attitude can have a slight effect on the reading, the needle will still generally indicate towards the beacon, however it suffers from DIP error where the needle dips down {{in the direction of the}} turn.|$|E
50|$|The heading {{indicator}} (also called an HI) is a flight instrument {{used in an}} aircraft to inform the pilot of the aircraft's heading. It is sometimes referred to by its older names, the directional gyro or DG, and also (UK usage) <b>direction</b> <b>indicator</b> or DI.|$|E
