40|$|Dual-color live cell {{fluorescence}} microscopy of fast intracellular trafficking processes, such as axonal transport, requires rapid switching of illumination channels. Typical broad-spectrum sources necessitate {{the use of}} mechanical filter switching, which introduces delays between acquisition of different fluorescence channels, impeding the interpretation and quantification of highly dynamic processes. Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs), however, allow modulation of excitation light in microseconds. Here we provide a step-by-step protocol to enable any scientist to build a research-grade LED <b>illuminator</b> <b>for</b> live cell microscopy, even without prior experience with electronics or optics.

This invited paper discusses the general subject of laser <b>illuminators</b> <b>for</b> high speed photography as well as specific capabilities of a high repetition rate Q switched ruby laser system that provides laser pulse repetition rates up to 1 MHz. Individual laser pulse energies of ~ 1 J are obtained at a laser repetition rate of 250 kHz, and proportionately lower energies as the pulse repetition rate is increased to 1 MHz. Nearly uniform pulse to pulse micropulse laser pulse energies are obtained providing for nearly constant illumination over the ~ 120 s laser pulse envelope duration.
