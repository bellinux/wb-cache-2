5|$|According to Hussein's {{account of}} the events, Abu Nuwar and the Free Officers had planned for the Bedouin-dominated First Infantry Regiment in Zarqa to {{participate}} in a training exercise in the desert without ammunition to render it unavailable for Hussein to use against a planned anti-government demonstration scheduled to be held by Nabulsi on 14 April. Hussein was still wary of Nabulsi due to an alleged intercept of a message from Nasser imploring Nabulsi to resist his dismissal from the premiership. Hussein was informed of the Free Officers' alleged plot by Sharif Naser and Bedouin officers from Zarqa on the evening of 13 April. The incident coincided with a delivery by Abu Nuwar of an ultimatum to Prime Minister Said al-Mufti (Nabulsi's successor) warning Hussein to appoint a government reflecting the will of the elected parliament or face an army revolt. Al-Mufti apparently broke down emotionally in Hussein's presence, prompting the latter to inquire from Abu Nuwar about the ultimatum, to which Abu Nuwar professed his surprise. Hussein then brought Abu Nuwar along with him to inspect the scene at Zarqa, where Hussein was told by loyalist officers from Zarqa that rumors of his death had provoked heavy clashes between his loyalists and those of Abu Nuwar and that only the physical presence of <b>Hussein</b> <b>would</b> {{put an end to the}} fighting. Moreover, Hussein was told that Rashid and Ma'an Abu Nuwar (a distant cousin of Abu Nuwar) had been ordered to Amman to besiege the royal palace and arrest Hussein.|$|E
25|$|Both Yazid and Hussein {{had been}} {{involved}} in the siege of Constantinople a few years earlier. Hussein was in the army that laid siege under the command of Muawiyah's son Yazeed in AH 51.

25|$|After {{originally}} {{departing from}} Minneapolis, Hussein's body arrived in Istanbul, Turkey, where governmental officials awaited on 5 February 2014. The Somali National Funeral Committee announced that <b>Hussein</b> <b>would</b> {{be buried in}} Mogadishu's National Cemetery, with the official farewell event slated to start on Friday after the burial service.

25|$|After just 100 {{hours of}} ground combat, {{and with all}} of Kuwait and much of {{southern}} Iraq under coalition control, US President George H. W. Bush ordered a cease-fire and negotiations began resulting in an agreement for cessation of hostilities. Some US politicians were disappointed by this move, believing Bush should have pressed on to Baghdad and removed Hussein from power; {{there is little doubt}} that coalition forces could have accomplished this if they had desired. Still, the political ramifications of removing <b>Hussein</b> <b>would</b> have broadened the scope of the conflict greatly, and many coalition nations refused to participate in such an action, believing it would create a power vacuum and destabilize the region.|$|E
500|$|Raffles {{arrived in}} Singapore on 28 January 1819 and soon {{recognised}} the island {{as a natural}} choice for the new port. It lay at {{the southern tip of}} the Malay peninsula, near the Straits of Malacca, and possessed a natural deep harbor, fresh water supplies, and timber for repairing ships. It was also located along the main trade route between India and China. Raffles found a small Malay settlement {{at the mouth of the}} Singapore River, with an estimated population of about 1000 that consisted of the Orang Laut (sea gypsies), Malays and Chinese. headed by the Temenggong and Tengku Abdu'r Rahman. Around 100 of these Malays had originally moved to Singapore from Johor in 1811 led by Temenggong. [...] The island was nominally ruled by the Sultan of Johor, who was controlled by the Dutch and the Bugis. However, the Sultanate was weakened by factional division and Tengku Abdu'r Rahman and his officials were loyal to Tengku Rahman's elder brother Tengku Long who was living in exile in Riau. With the Temenggong's help, Raffles managed to smuggle Tengku Long back into Singapore. He offered to recognize Tengku Long [...] as the rightful Sultan of Johor, given the title of Sultan Hussein and provide him with a yearly payment of $5000 and $3000 to the Temenggong; in return, Sultan <b>Hussein</b> <b>would</b> grant the British the right to establish a trading post on Singapore. A formal treaty was signed on 6 February 1819 and modern Singapore was born.|$|E

2500|$|In December 2006, <b>Hussein</b> said he <b>would</b> take {{responsibility}} [...] "with honour" [...] for any attacks on Iran using conventional or chemical weapons during the 1980–1988 war, {{but he took}} issue with charges he ordered attacks on Iraqis.|$|R
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the Criminal Code, the Ba'athist regime, especially under Saddam <b>Hussein,</b> <b>would</b> issue additional resolutions on specific topics.

[...] In the agreement, Sultan Husain would receive a yearly sum of 5,000 Spanish dollars, with the Temenggong receiving a yearly sum of 3,000 Spanish dollars. This agreement was ratified with a formal treaty signed on 6 February 1819, and modern Singapore was born.|$|E
2500|$|The legacy {{left behind}} by Ismail is often viewed in a {{positive}} light. It is conventionally held that his sudden death altered the course of Malaysian history – Tun Abdul Razak appointed Tun Hussein Onn as his new deputy, and <b>Hussein</b> Onn <b>would</b> later appoint Mahathir as Deputy Prime Minister after succeeding Razak, setting Mahathir on the course towards becoming Prime Minister. Despite this, historians have often overlooked Ismail; one biographer of his has said that: ...|$|R

His father was also the maternal uncle of Saddam <b>Hussein,</b> whom <b>would</b> later marry Khairallah's sister, Sajida Talfah.

50|$|The Iraqi Army {{officers}} {{planning to}} kill Saddam with tank fire were compromised, arrested and executed {{before they could}} carry out the operation.

Despite Baer's pleas for American support of the offensive, none was offered, and the Kurdish troops were forced to withdraw. Baer was immediately recalled from Iraq and briefly investigated for the attempted murder of Saddam <b>Hussein.</b> He <b>would</b> later be cleared.|$|R
2500|$|Transjordan {{had been}} a no man's land {{following}} the July 1920 Battle of Maysalun. During this period, the British chose to avoid any definite connection with Palestine until a March 1921 conference at which {{it was agreed that}} Abdullah bin <b>Hussein</b> <b>would</b> administer the territory {{under the auspices of the}} Palestine Mandate. The Trans-Jordan Memorandum provided the detail to support Article 25 of the Mandate, such that the Jewish National Home did not apply to the territory east of the Jordan River. It also established a separate [...] "Administration of Trans-Jordan" [...] for the application of the Mandate, under the general supervision of Great Britain. Transjordan became largely autonomous under British tutelage according to an agreement of February 20, 1928, and fully independent under a treaty with Britain of March 22, 1946.|$|E
2500|$|At times Cockburn {{displayed}} prescience in his writing.

The target at home will be the Bill of Rights." [...] Cockburn went on to join {{the opposition to the}} 2003 invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq by American, British and other national military forces (the self-described [...] "Coalition of the Willing"). He forged alliances with libertarians and others concerned by the USA Patriot Act. In the wake of the capture of Saddam Hussein, Cockburn penned a column entitled [...] "How to kill Saddam", in which he argued that the ensuing trial of <b>Hussein</b> <b>would</b> be a sham, conducted by a [...] "kangaroo court", and that Hussein's conviction and ultimate execution were foregone conclusions.|$|E

5|$|The attack would {{consist of}} a four-prong offensive. The 1st Mechanized Division would pass through the 7th and 14th Infantry Divisions to protect the flank of the 3rd Armored Division, which would provide a {{blocking}} force west of Khafji while the 5th Mechanized Division took the town. The 1st Mechanized and 3rd Armored divisions would then retire to Kuwait, while the 5th Mechanized Division would wait until the Coalition launched a counteroffensive.

2500|$|Hazza' Al-Majali was {{appointed}} by Hussein to form a government; it consisted of loyalists who had persuaded Hussein to launch an offensive against the Iraqi government to restore the Hashemite monarchy. The expedition was cancelled amid British opposition and the weakened state of the Royal Jordanian Air Force. UAR agents assassinated prime minister Al-Majali with a bomb planted in his office. Twenty minutes later, another explosion went off; it was intended for Hussein as it was expected he would run to the scene, which he didhe was a few minutes late. Hussein, persuaded by Habis Al-Majali, Hazza's cousin and the army chief of staff, prepared for a retaliation against Syria. He prepared three brigades in the north, but the operation was called off after combined pressures from the Americans and the British. Egyptian radios dismissed Hussein as the [...] "Judas of the Arabs". <b>Hussein</b> <b>would</b> be subjected to several more assassination attempts. One involved replacing his nose drops with strong acid. Another plot was uncovered after {{a large number of}} cats were found dead in the royal palace; it emerged that the cook had been trying poisons to use against the king. Assassination attempts against the king subsided after a successful coup toppled the Syrian regime on 28September 1961 and the UAR collapsed. With a calmed situation in Jordan, the King issued his slogan [...] "Let us build this country to serve this nation." [...] But critics considered the slogan mere lip service, saying Hussein showed little interest in the economic situation of the country, unlike the military and foreign relations aspects.|$|E
60|$|But all Ibrahim's {{operations}} {{were marked by}} a want of rapidity. After securing Antioch, the Turkish army should have marched upon Horns, which offered an excellent position, where they might have established a communication with the Druses, upon whom some hopes were founded, and whence they would have commanded the road to Damascus. But it was not till the 6th of July that <b>Hussein</b> <b>would</b> execute this movement. Mehemet Pasha commenced his march; but in their haste they forgot to issue rations to the troops, who reached Horns at ten in the morning, almost dead with hunger and fatigue. The Seraskier of Aleppo was encamped, with his irregular troops, {{at the gates of}} the city; but without deigning even to think of the enemy, whom they thought to be at some distance, or to issue rations to the serving troops, they wasted their time in vain ceremonies.|$|E
