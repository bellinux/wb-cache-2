500|$|On 31 March 1945, Galland flew 12 {{operational}} jets to Munich {{to begin}} operations. On 5 April, he organised the interception of a USAAF raid. The Me 262s destroyed three B-17s. On 16 April Galland claimed two Martin B-26 Marauder bombers shot down. On 21 April, to his surprise, he was visited by Göring {{for the final}} time. Göring officially assigned Günther Lützow to him and confessed to Galland that his assertions about the Me 262 {{and the use of}} bomber pilots with experience as jet fighter pilots had been correct. He enquired about the progress of his unit with outspoken civility. As they parted, Göring said, [...] "I envy you Galland, for going into action. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> a few years younger and less bulky. If I were, I would gladly put myself under your command. It would be marvelous to have nothing to worry about but a good fight, like it was in the old days." ...|$|E
2500|$|The song {{continues}} to be regarded by some critics as a girl-pop classic, though others continue to {{view it as a}} sub-par girl pop song. It was included on several girl-pop compilations, including Growin' Up Too Fast: The Girl Group Anthology (1996), <b>I</b> <b>Wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>Were</b> a Princess: The Great Lost Female Teen Idols (1997), and Early Girls, Vol. 3 (2000). Charli XCX cited the song as an influence when recording her Sucker album. According to Goldmine Standard Catalog of American Records 1948-1991, the 7" [...] release of [...] "Dumb Head" [...] is now worth $12.|$|E
2500|$|Colin McDonald was {{captain of}} Victoria and an {{effective}} opener {{with a short}} backlift who had made centuries against South Africa and the West Indies and had stood up to Tyson in 1954-55. He made as fighting 32 and 89 in , but failed {{in the rest of}} the 1956 series. In 1958-59 McDonald's 519 runs (64.87) made him the first batsmen to top 500 runs in an Ashes series since Len Hutton in 1950-51 and the first Australian to do so since Don Bradman in 1948. His opening partner was Jim Burke a stonewaller who took 578 minutes to make 189 against South Africa in 1957-58 [...] and was the butt of the Sydney Hill barrackers; [...] "Burkey, you're so like a statue, <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> a pigeon" [...] He didn't make many runs in 1958-59 though he tended to hang around and retired at the end of the season rather than face the increasingly number of fast bowlers. Neil Harvey was Australia's premier batsmen after the retirement of Don Bradman, a left-handed strokemaker whose technique allowed him to make runs while other could hardly get bat to ball. Norm O'Neill made his debut in this series and was like a breath of fresh air in the stagnant cricket of the late 1950s. Athletic, good-looking and a positive strokemaker he was hailed as the [...] "New Bradman" [...] and a favourite with the crowds. Crowds flocked to his games just to see the [...] "Australian Hope" [...] and his striking 71 not out to win the First Test made a mockery of the England's funeral second innings. After Harvey and O'Neill came Ken Mackay sarcastically called [...] "Slasher Mackay" [...] as he rarely indulged in strokeplay, instead the ungainly Queenslander set about occupying the crease for as long a possible. He never made a Test century and only averaged 33.48, but always seemed to make runs when Australia was in trouble. Les Favell had a terrible time as an opener against Tyson and Statham in 1954-55, but was now a powerful middle-order batsman and crowd favourate who replaced Peter Burge after the First Test. Worth a mention is Bobby Simpson, a batting prodigy to match Norm O'Neill and an outstanding slip fielder, who made a duck in his only Test innings in the series, but was often 12th man and used as a substitute fielder. In the lower order were Richie Benaud and Alan Davidson, both hard-hitting all-rounders who liked to attack the bowling, but whose late order heroics were seldom needed.|$|E
