30|$|In this article, highly {{sensitive}} and low confinement loss enriching micro structured photonic crystal fiber (PCF) {{has been suggested}} as an optical sensor. The proposed PCF is porous cored hexagonal (P-HPCF) where cladding contains five layers with circular air holes and core vicinity is formed by two layered elliptical air holes. Two fundamental propagation characteristics such as the relative sensitivity and confinement loss of the proposed P-HPCF have been numerically scrutinized by the full vectorial finite element method (FEM) simulation procedure. The optimized values are modified with different geometrical parameters like diameters of circular or elliptical air <b>holes,</b> <b>pitches</b> of the core, and cladding region over a spacious assortment of wavelength from 0.8 µm to 1.8 µm. All pretending results exhibit that the relative sensitivity is enlarged according to decrement of wavelength of the transmission band (O+E+S+C+L+U). In addition, all useable liquids reveal the maximum sensitivity of 57.00 %, 57.18 %, and 57.27 % for n= 1.33, 1.354, and 1.366 respectively by lower band. Moreover, effective area, nonlinear coefficient, frequency, propagation constant, total electric energy, total magnetic energy, and wave number in free space of the proposed P-HPCF have been reported recently.|$|R

40|$|A {{new type}} of Time Projection Chamber (TPC) has been {{proposed}} for the upgrade of the ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment at CERN) so as to cater to the high luminosity environment expected at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) facility in future. This device will rely on the intrinsic ion back flow (IBF) suppression of Micro-Pattern Gas Detectors (MPGD) based technology in particular the Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM). GEM is to minimise the space charge effect in the main drift volume and thus will not require the standard gating grid and the resulting intrinsic dead time. It will thus be possible to read all minimum bias Pb [...] Pb events that the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will deliver at the anticipated peak interaction rate of 50 kHz for the high luminosity heavy-ion era in Run 3. New read-out electronics will send the continuous data stream to a new online farm at rates up to 1 TByte/s.

40|$|AbstractDischarge {{coefficients}} of 3 -in- 1 hole of three inclination angles and three spacing between holes are presented which described the discharge {{behavior of a}} row of holes. The inlet and outlet of the 3 -in- 1 hole both have a 15 ° lateral expansion. The flow conditions considered are mainstream turbulence intensities and density ratios of secondary flow to mainstream. The momentum flux ratios varied {{in the range from}} 1 to 4. The comparison is made of the discharge {{coefficients of}} three shaped holes to find an optimal hole with low flow loss. The results show that the discharge coefficients of 3 -in- 1 hole are highest in three shaped holes and therefore this article is focused on the measurements of discharge coefficients of 3 -in- 1 hole for various geometries and aerodynamic parameters. The measured results of 3 -in- 1 hole indicate that turbulence intensities, density ratios and momentum flux ratios have weak influence on discharge coefficients for inclination angle of 20 °. The high turbulence intensity yields the small discharge coefficients for inclination angle of 45 ° and 90 °. The increased both momentum flux ratios and density ratios lead to the increased discharge coefficients for inclination angle of 45 ° and 90 °. The increased inclination angle causes the rapidly increased discharge coefficients. There is a weak dependence of discharge coefficients on <b>hole</b> <b>pitches...</b>|$|R

A novel {{architecture}} of all-optical wavelength conversion {{in a highly}} nonlinear bismuth oxide-based photonic crystal fiber (PCF) is demonstrated. Self-phase modulation is utilized to induce spectral broadening for the all-optical wavelength converter. A recirculating configuration is designed to obtain the twice spectral broadening. Therefore, wavelength conversion is achieved. The design and the simulation of PCF are demonstrated. The desired dispersion properties can be tailored by the parameters of bismuth oxide (Bi 2 O 3) PCF microstructure. The propagation loss at 1550 nm is about 0. 8 dB/m. The simulation results of PCF indicate {{the relationship of the}} effective index of the fundamental mode, the mode effective area and the <b>holes</b> <b>pitch</b> of PCF. The nonlinear coefficient is expected to be 1100 W(- 1) km(- 1) by using bismuth oxide-based glass and reducing the effective core area.
