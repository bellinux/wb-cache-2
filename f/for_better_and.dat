The four recreational centers are named after their location on the map - North, East, South, and West. They each include one or more baseball fields and at least two tennis courts. There are two main parks, Cascade and Elywood, which are connected by a drive-on ford in the center. The Lorain County Metro Parks took over control of Cascade Park in late 2014, and has unveiled a master plan project throughout 2018 to restore the park <b>for</b> <b>better</b> <b>and</b> safer use, as well as maintain the park.|$|E
25|$|The Child PTSD Symptom Scale (CPSS) {{is a free}} {{checklist}} {{designed for}} children and adolescents to report traumatic events and symptoms that they might feel afterward. The items cover the symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), specifically, the symptoms and clusters used in the DSM-IV. Although relatively new, {{there has been a}} fair amount of research on the CPSS due to the frequency of traumatic events involving children. The CPSS is usually administered to school children within school boundaries, or in an off-site location to assess symptoms of trauma. Some, but not all, people experience symptoms after a traumatic event, and in serious cases, these people may not get better on their own. Early and accurate identification, especially in children, of experiencing distress following a trauma could help with early interventions. The CPSS {{is one of a handful}} of promising measures that has accrued good evidence for reliability and validity, along with low cost, giving it good clinical utility as it addresses a public health need <b>for</b> <b>better</b> <b>and</b> larger scale assessment.|$|E

[...] Metacritic gave it a score of 51 (out of 100) from 28 critics, indicating [...] "mixed or average" [...] reviews.

500|$|Bean {{starred in}} the first season of Game of Thrones, HBO's {{adaptation}} of the A Song of Ice and Fire novels by George R. R. Martin, playing the part of Lord Eddard Stark. Bean and Peter Dinklage were the two actors whose inclusion show runners David Benioff and D. B. Weiss considered necessary for the show to become a success, and for whose roles no other actors were considered. His portrayal won him critical praise; as The A.V. Club reviewer put it, he [...] "portrayed Ned {{as a man who}} knew he lived in the muck but hoped <b>for</b> <b>better</b> <b>and</b> assumed everyone else would come along for the ride." [...] HBO's promotional efforts focused on Bean as the show's leading man and best-known actor.|$|E

He served with distinction in the Apache Wars, including the Red River War relocating Southern Plains tribes to reservations in Oklahoma. General Pope made political enemies in Washington when he recommended that the reservation system would be better administered by the military than the corrupt Indian Bureau. He also engendered controversy by calling <b>for</b> <b>better</b> <b>and</b> more humane treatment of Native Americans, but author Walter Donald Kennedy notes that he also said [...] "It is my purpose to utterly exterminate the Sioux" [...] and planned to make a [...] "final settlement with all these Indians".|$|E

500|$|The Bangkok Post {{noted that}} the band [...] "stick firmly to their '90s alt-rock guns." [...] Their [...] "fuzzy-guitar/catchy-hook formula {{continues}} to dominate the album" [...] and amidst the fuzz and electronics, [...] "the title-track, Sugar and Beloved Freak do offer moments of (relatively) quiet bliss" [...] — songs that [...] "refreshingly showcase the essence of Manson's voice". It is proposed however that, apart from older, devoted 90's fans, the album probably won't connect with contemporary audiences. In his review for Time, Adam Kivel likewise stated that the album {{is most likely to}} resonate with fans of 90's alternative fusion, characterizing it as [...] "an anomaly" [...] in the current musical climate and not likely to gain significant radio-play. Lindsay Zoladz of Pitchfork Media summarized the album as [...] "a statement from a band that's stuck, combatively, to its guns. The times have changed but Garbage haven't, and now, <b>for</b> <b>better</b> <b>and</b> for worse, they've at last become alternative to everything." ...|$|E
500|$|Gender was a {{recurring}} theme in Rix Nicholas's career, <b>for</b> <b>better</b> <b>and</b> for worse. Praise from a French art critic for her abilities was expressed by saying [...] " [...] Rix paints like a man!". An Australian critic was unsure what to say, admiring her composition but declaring her technique [...] "strangely unfeminine". Pigot considered that, when Rix Nicholas sought to stake out a woman's place in nationalist art in mid-twentieth century Australia, her career was ultimately penalised by her unwillingness {{to play by the}} male establishment's rules. Art historian Catherine Speck had a different perspective on Rix Nicholas's post-World War I work, suggesting that it never subsequently attained the quality of her Paris output, because her first husband's death in the Great War drove her to create nationalist images of inconsistent quality. In their reference work A Story of Australian Painting, Mary Eagle and John Jones considered Rix Nicholas, alongside Clarice Beckett, to be [...] "the best woman artist to emerge from the artistic milieu of Melbourne in the decade of the First World War".|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{wrote that}} prior to Nirvana, [...] "alternative music was {{consigned}} to specialty sections of record stores, and major labels considered it to be, at the very most, a tax write-off". Following the release of Nevermind, [...] "nothing was ever quite the same, <b>for</b> <b>better</b> <b>and</b> for worse". The success of Nevermind not only popularized grunge, but also established [...] "the cultural and commercial viability of alternative rock in general". While other alternative bands had hits before, Nirvana [...] "broke down the doors forever", according to Erlewine. Erlewine further stated that Nirvana's breakthrough [...] "didn't eliminate the underground", but rather [...] "just gave it more exposure". In 1992, Jon Pareles of The New York Times reported that Nirvana's breakthrough had made others in the alternative scene impatient for achieving similar success, noting, [...] "Suddenly, all bets are off. No one has the inside track on which of dozens, perhaps hundreds, of ornery, obstreperous, unkempt bands might next appeal to the mall-walking millions". Record company executives offered large advances and record deals to bands, and previous strategies of building audiences for alternative rock groups {{had been replaced by}} the opportunity to achieve mainstream popularity quickly.|$|E

500|$|The Haitians at gravest risk {{of victimization}} by human traffickers are its poorest people, {{particularly}} children. In Haiti, the poorest {{country in the}} western hemisphere, over half the population lives on less than {{a dollar a day}} and over three quarters live on less than two dollars a day. [...] Severe poverty, compiled with a lack of social services such as education and basic healthcare increases a child’s vulnerability to modern slavery. [...] Factors that increase a child's likelihood of becoming a restavek include illness or loss of one or both parents, lack of access to clean water, lack of educational opportunities, and having access to family in a city. [...] In addition to poverty, individual factors that can lead to exploitation include unemployment, illiteracy, poor educational opportunities, a history of physical or sexual abuse, homelessness, and drug abuse. These individual factors “push” people towards pathways of human trafficking and modern day slavery. Oftentimes men, women and children accept slave-like work conditions because there is little hope <b>for</b> <b>better</b> <b>and</b> they need to survive. Some cross national borders in search of positive opportunities, but instead find themselves a part of the exploited work force. [...] Additionally, factors that make people easy targets for traffickers make enslavement more likely. [...] One group at high risk for sexual enslavement and other types of forced labor is internally displaced persons, particularly women and children living in refugee camps, [...] which offer little security. [...] The estimated 10% of undocumented Haitians, whose births go unreported, are at especial risk of enslavement.|$|E

Although GameSpy felt that the menu interface was not optimized in terms of usability, it lauded the look of the game's cinematics and briefing screens.

2500|$|Another factor {{influencing}} the band's style was {{the concept of}} [...] "All", invented by Stevenson and friend Pat McCuistion during a late-night fishing trip on Stevenson's boat, the Orca. According to Aukerman: [...] "While drinking all this coffee {{in the midst of}} catching mackerel they came up with the concept of All — doing the utmost, achieving the utmost. The more they got into it the more it turned into their own religion; it's partly humor, but it's also an outlook on how to conduct your life: to not settle for some, to always go for All". Stevenson described the concept of [...] "All" [...] as [...] "the total extent", and recalled that [...] "the quest for All became the main catalyst of the band, and we adopted this omni-ambitious way of life, <b>for</b> <b>better</b> <b>and</b> for better".

2500|$|While both {{biological}} and reciprocal altruism are observed in other animals, our species' complex social behaviors take these raw materials much farther. Philanthropy by wealthy individuals—some, such as Andrew Carnegie giving away their entire vast fortunes—have historically provided {{a multitude of}} public goods for others. [...] One major impact was the Rockefeller Foundation's development of the [...] "Green Revolution" [...] hybrid grains that probably saved many millions of people from starvation in the 1970s. Christian missionaries, who typically spend large parts {{of their lives in}} remote, often dangerous places, have had disproportionate impact compared with their numbers worldwide for centuries. Communist revolutionaries in the 20th century had similar dedication and outsized impacts.
