5|$|A toxin-antitoxin {{system is}} a set of two or more closely linked genes that {{together}} encode both a protein 'poison' and a corresponding 'antidote'. When these systems are contained on plasmids– transferable genetic elements– they ensure that only the daughter cells that inherit the plasmid survive after cell division. If the plasmid is absent in a daughter cell, the unstable antitoxin is degraded and the stable toxic protein kills the new cell; this is known as 'post-segregational killing' (PSK). Toxin-antitoxin systems are widely distributed in prokaryotes, and organisms often <b>have</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> multiple copies.|$|E
5|$|Watsessing Avenue {{station is}} located on the corner of Watsessing Avenue and Orange Street at Westinghouse Plaza in Bloomfield and is just blocks from Bloomfield's borders with East Orange and Orange. The former depot is {{currently}} used by the Bloomfield Police Benevolent Association. There are two below-street-level platforms at the Watsessing station. Ticket vending machines are available at street level on Watsessing Avenue and a $5 surcharge applies if riders buy them on the train; the Montclair-Boonton Line added vending machines to the remaining stations that did not <b>have</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> 2011.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century, the {{psychiatric}} reform that had been implemented by Franco Basaglia in Italy became known and was publicly declared to be implemented in Russia, with the view of retrenchment of expenditures. But {{when it became clear that}} even more money was needed for the reform, it got bogged down in the same way the reform of the army and many other undertakings did. Russia is decades behind the countries of the European Union in mental health reform, which has already been implemented or is being implemented in them. Until Russian society, Gushansky says, is aware of the need for mental health reform, we will live in the atmosphere of animosity, mistrust and violence. Many experts believe that problems spread beyond psychiatry to society as a whole. As Robert van Voren supposes, the Russians want to have their compatriots with mental disorders locked up outside the city and do not want to <b>have</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> community. Despite the 1992 Russian Mental Health Law, coercive psychiatry in Russia remains generally unregulated and fashioned by the same trends toward hyperdiagnosis and overreliance on institutional care characteristic of the Soviet period. In the Soviet Union, there had been an increase of the bed numbers because psychiatric services had been used to treat dissidents.|$|E

5|$|During Fineshriber's {{early years}} the {{congregation}} continued to modify its religious practices. At funerals, it encouraged mourners {{to leave the}} graveside, rather than having them wait until the coffin was lowered and cover it with earth themselves (as was the traditional practice). By this time, few members had bar mitzvah ceremonies for their 13-year-old boys; instead, boys and girls participated in the Reform Confirmation ceremony (though the synagogue still allowed those who wanted bar mitzvah ceremonies to <b>have</b> <b>them).</b> <b>In</b> 1916, the congregation eliminated the observance of the eighth days of Passover and Sukkot, required all worshipers to stand when mourners stood to recite the kaddish, and restored the Orthodox practice of blessing and naming babies in the synagogue {{as part of the}} services.|$|E
25|$|The Type 62 {{has also}} been {{exported}} widely. Foreign nations which field, or have fielded, the Type 62 include North Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Bangladesh, Tanzania, Democratic Republic of Congo, Republic of the Congo, Mali, Albania and Sudan. There {{is a lot of}} confusion concerning the North Korean Ch'ŏnma-ho main battle tank which is sometimes considered to be an upgrade of Type 62 light tank. This is incorrect as the Ch'ŏnma-ho main battle tank is based on the Soviet T-62 main battle tank. This originated from the fact that many times tanks like Type 59 and Type 62 are listed as T-59 and T-62. This leads to many confusions which in turn lead to, for example, listing the Albania as T-62 main battle tank operator and calling the Ch'ŏnma-ho main battle tank an upgrade of Type 62 light tank. It's not clear which nations still <b>have</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> service, although based on available knowledge it seems that all original users still have it either on active or reserve status except for North Korea which didn't <b>have</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> service as of 1995.|$|E
25|$|This {{is in fact}} a type of gapped {{relative}} clause, but {{is distinguished}} {{by the fact that the}} role of the shared noun in the embedded clause is indicated indirectly by the case marking of the marker (the relative pronoun) used to join the main and embedded clauses. All languages which use relative pronouns <b>have</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> clause-initial position: though one could conceivably imagine a clause-final relative pronoun analogous to an adverbial subordinator in that position, they are unknown.|$|E

25|$|Although prized as an {{ornamental}} flower, {{some people}} consider narcissi unlucky, because they hang their heads implying misfortune, and hence refuse to <b>have</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> the house. White narcissi are especially associated with death, especially the pure white N triandrus 'Thalia', and hence are considered grave flowers. Indeed, in Ancient Greece narcissi were planted near tombs. Robert Herrick, describes them as portents of death, an association which also {{appears in the}} myth of Persephone and the underworld (see The Arts, below).|$|E
25|$|Task Review: Invicta, {{despite making}} an {{immediate}} {{start on the}} task, chose to shop around before making purchases, though Syed's attempt to find the dinner jacket in East London turned up none that matched the required specifications. While the team managed to purchase all 10 items, many deals were rushed through with only minimal discounts. Meanwhile, Velocity wasted nearly three hours at the start {{trying to come up}} with a strategy, and while Ruth's sub-team performed well, Jo's sub-team wasted even more time by bargaining for items in shops that did not <b>have</b> <b>them</b> <b>in</b> stock, and failing to purchase the tyre required, resulting in a fine that cost them victory.|$|E
25|$|In 1945, More Fun Comics #101 {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} Superboy, establishing that Superman began his superhero career as a child. This issue showed Krypton in much greater detail than before, as a scientifically advanced world. Kryptonians {{did not appear to}} possess superhuman powers on Krypton but were aware that a Kryptonian on Earth would <b>have</b> <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> this story, Superman's biological parents were named Jor-El and Lara. Jor-El attempted to convince the Supreme Council that their world was doomed and that they must take action. The Council scoffed at Jor-El's warnings, so he returned home to save his family, if nobody else. But Jor-El was only able to save his son.|$|E

500|$|In {{terms of}} {{advanced}} technology, the Soviet Union was {{far behind the}} United States, Western Europe, and Japan.

500|$|... "Falling Down" [...] is a rock {{song that}} {{features}} [...] "aggressive" [...] guitar and drum lines powered by [...] "bloopy" [...] synths.

[...] The song is set in common time, and has a tempo of 140 beats per minute. It is written in the key of D aerycryllian mode, and Gomez's vocals span from the low note of A3 to high note of D5. It follows the chord progression Dm–C–Dm-C. Bill Lamb of About.com gave the single 4 out of 5 stars, calling the song [...] "catchy" [...] and commending Gomez's [...] "sassy" [...] vocals and its lyrics.
