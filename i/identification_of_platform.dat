Abstract: This paper {{introduces}} a methodology and algorithm for the qualitative <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>platform</b> components at multiple levels of system aggregation, among variants within a family of systems. We assume that the architectural concept and the functional requirements for the variants are pre-determined, and use Sensitivity Design Structure Matrices (SDSM) to represent the sensitivities between the design variables of the variants. We then introduce a novel algorithm for the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>platform</b> variables given the SDSM for each variant. Finally, the methodology is extended to the qualitative identification of platforms at various levels of system aggregation, i. e., between systems, subsystems and components. The process is demonstrated in an automotive vehicle example of platform identification...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Unmanned aerial {{vehicles}} (UAVs) {{represent a}} quickly evolving technology, broadening {{the availability of}} remote sensing tools to small-scale research groups {{across a variety of}} scientific fields. Development of UAV platforms requires broad technical skills covering platform development, data post-processing, and image analysis. UAV development is constrained by a need to balance technological accessibility, flexibility in application and quality in image data. In this study, the quality of UAV imagery acquired by a miniature 6 -band multispectral imaging sensor was improved through the application of practical image-based sensor correction techniques. Three major components of sensor correction were focused upon: noise reduction, sensor-based modification of incoming radiance, and lens distortion. Sensor noise was reduced through the use of dark offset imagery. Sensor modifications through the effects of filter transmission rates, the relative monochromatic efficiency of the sensor and the effects of vignetting were removed through a combination of spatially/spectrally dependent correction factors. Lens distortion was reduced through the implementation of the Brown–Conrady model. Data post-processing serves dual roles in data quality improvement, and the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>platform</b> limitations and sensor idiosyncrasies. The proposed corrections improve the quality of the raw multispectral imagery, facilitating subsequent quantitative image analysis...|$|E

Unwanted vibrations in the platform could affect the results of experiments which are planned. Therefore, it is important that sensors (accelerometers) be strategically placed to identify the amount and extent of these unwanted vibrations, and to validate the mathematical models used to predict the loads and dynamic response. Due to cost, installation, and data management issues, {{only a limited number of}} sensors will be available for placement. This work evaluates and compares four representative sensor placement algorithms for modal <b>identification.</b> Most <b>of</b> the sensor placement work to date has employed only numerical simulations for comparison.

Acheulean variability includes a widely recognized increase in biface refinement from the Early to Late Acheulean, however the specific timing and technological nature of this shift remain unclear as do its behavioral, cognitive, and evolutionary implications. To investigate this topic, we examined lithic collections from the early Middle Pleistocene Acheulean site of Boxgrove for evidence of the use <b>of</b> <b>platform</b> preparation as a biface thinning technique. To aid in the <b>identification</b> and assessment <b>of</b> <b>platform</b> preparation, Boxgrove artifacts were compared with experimental products of Inexperienced, Novice, and Expert stone knappers.

Various educational institutions do not have or {{do not wish to}} invest in such a structure, possibly because MOOCs are not yet part of official programs of universities, but initiatives by a particular teacher or a research group. Focusing on this problem, this study seeks to identify platforms that make it possible to create, host and provide courses free of charges for the offeror; find in the respective literature, the basic requirements for MOOC platforms and to evaluate the platforms based on the raised requirements. In order to identify the platforms, information was sought in scientific articles and websites dealing with the comparison <b>of</b> <b>platforms</b> and listing the existing MOOC providers. For the definition of evaluation requirements, there was a search in the Web of Science and Scopus databases, looking for the term "Massive Open Online Courses".

Commonality decisions are based on values of the performance deviation vector, and the product family is designed optimally with respect to the chosen platform.

40|$|System <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> {{offshore}} floating <b>platforms</b> {{is usually}} performed by testing small-scale models in wave tanks, where controlled conditions, such as still water for free decay tests, regular and irregular wave loading can be represented. However, this approach {{may result in}} constraints on model dimensions, testing time, and costs of the experimental activity. For such reasons, intermediate-scale field modelling of offshore floating structures may become an interesting as well as cost-effective alternative in a near future. Clearly, since the open sea is not a controlled environment, traditional system identification may become challenging and less precise. In this paper, a new approach based on Frequency Domain Decomposition (FDD) method for Operational Modal Analysis is proposed and validated against numerical simulations in ANSYS AQWA v. 16. 0 on a simple spar-type structure. The results obtained match well with numerical predictions, showing that this new approach, opportunely coupled with more traditional wave tanks techniques, proves to be very promising to perform field-site <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> the model structures...|$|R

40|$|In {{order for}} gene {{delivery}} to be clinically acceptable, {{a number of}} crucial developments {{need to be made}} to existing vectors. Significant advances {{have been made in the}} <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> novel <b>platform</b> vectors that possess modified tropism to the native vector, directing infectivity away from nontarget tissues such as the liver. In order to fully optimize these detargeted platform vectors, they need to be retargeted toward a chosen, defined site, which will be defined according to the disease studied. The successful transition of targeting peptides identified using in vitro screening protocols to an in vivo disease model may be compromized by the complexity of delivery into an intact biological system. To this end, peptides identified using in vivo biopanning may prove to be of greater clinical significance given that they were identified in the disease model of choice and so should translate more successfully to the intact preclinical model. Exploitation of the heterogeneity of the vascular endothelium using such an approach will go a long way toward improving the efficiency and achieving site-specific gene expression, with important clinical implications for the systemic application of gene delivery...|$|R
40|$|Although platform-independence is {{a central}} {{property}} in MDA models, the study of platformindependence has been largely overlooked in MDA. As a consequence, {{there is a lack}} of guidelines to select abstraction criteria and modelling concepts for platformindependent design. In addition, there is little methodological support to distinguish between platformindependent and platform-specific concerns, which could be detrimental to the beneficial exploitation of the PIM-PSM separation-of-concerns adopted by MDA. This paper is an attempt towards clarifying the notion of platformindependent modelling in MDA development. We argue that each level of platform-independence must be accompanied by the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> an abstract <b>platform.</b> An abstract platform is determined by the platform characteristics that are relevant for applications at a certain level of platform-independence, and must be established by balancing various design goals. We platform design, which forms a basis for defining requirements for design languages intended to support platform-independent design.

40|$|ABSTRACT Bacteria {{organize}} many membrane-related signaling {{processes in}} functional microdomains that are structurally and functionally {{similar to the}} lipid rafts of eukaryotic cells. An important structural component of these microdomains is the protein flotillin, which seems {{to act as a}} chaperone in recruiting other proteins to lipid rafts to facilitate their interaction. In eukaryotic cells, the occurrence of severe diseases is often observed in combination with an overproduction of flotillin, but a functional link between these two phenomena is yet to be demonstrated. In this work, we used the bacterial model Bacillus subtilis as a tractable system to study the physiological alterations that occur in cells that overproduce flotillin. We discovered that an excess of flotillin altered specific signal transduction pathways that are associated with the membrane microdomains of bacteria. As a consequence of this, we detected significant defects in cell division and cell differentiation. These physiological alterations were in part caused by an unusual stabilization of the raft-associated protease FtsH. This report opens the possibility of using bacteria as a working model to better understand fundamental questions related to the functionality of lipid rafts. IMPORTANCE The <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> signaling <b>platforms</b> in the membrane of bacteria that are functionally and structurally equivalent to eukaryotic lipid rafts reveals a level of sophistication in signal transduction and membrane organization unexpected in bacteria. It opens new and promising venues to address intricate questions related to the functionality of lipid rafts by using bacteria as a more tractable system. This is the first report that uses bacteria as a working model to investigate a fundamental question that was previously raised while studying the role of eukaryotic lipid rafts. It also provides evidence of the critical role <b>of</b> these signaling <b>platforms</b> in orchestrating diverse physiological processes in prokaryotic cells...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the development of a methodology for assessment of the safety of existing steel jacket platforms. The primary focus of this study has been on a methodology that can be used by regulatory bodies, owners, and operators to assess the safety <b>of</b> the offshore <b>platforms</b> located in the Gulf of Mexico. The safety assessment <b>of</b> ageing offshore <b>platforms</b> has become <b>of</b> increasing importance in the recent years in the United States and worldwide in order to ensure their safe operation and continued production of crude oil and gas. This has created a dilemma for the government regulatory bodies, owners, and operators in the United States, where a major number <b>of</b> <b>platforms</b> exist. In recent years, their interest in maintaining the safety <b>of</b> offshore <b>platforms</b> against loss <b>of</b> life, environmental pollution, and loss of resources and property has increased due to the awareness of the public of the consequences of their failure. Regulatory bodies, such as the Minerals Management Service (MMS) established in the United States, {{have a role to play}} to ensure that the structures operating in the offshore waters are safe to life, environment, property and loss of production. However, they do not have a methodology to make such routine assessments for the more than 4, 500 platforms operating in the Gulf of Mexico. In this study, a 4 -cycle screening methodology has been developed for making routine assessments of the safety <b>of</b> <b>platforms</b> against storm wave loads. Simplified techniques have been developed for platform capacity evaluation which will be of special importance for <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> potentially critical <b>platforms.</b> Judgements on their safety can be made based on a probabilistic approach, which utilizes the nominal estimates and the uncertainties in the load, strength, and consequences of the failure <b>of</b> a <b>platform.</b> Although the emphasis of this research is on safety assessment of the Gulf <b>of</b> Mexico <b>platforms</b> against the storm wave loads, the principles and theoretical background developed will be of use for assessment of the offshore structures in other areas and against other load sources. The ideas developed in this study could also be utilized in there­ qualification and rehabilitation of other civil engineering structures. In the State of California, CALTRANS, a government body, needs a process to evaluate the safety of more than 9, 000 existing bridges.

These parameters included, primarily platform rotational inertia and wheel slip. Data was collected in various track scenarios including benign flat terrain and more complicated beach runs. Track lengths spanned short straight paths of no more than 10 meters to full-run point-to-point autonomous navigation paths of up to 80 meters. The longer runs included turns of up to 180 degrees and terrain inclines of 2 degree or less. As expected the Shuey model proved reliable for short runs of no more than 10 meters. For long length runs in the beach environment the Dynamic Model diverged quickly. This is attributed to, primarily, wheel slip conditions {{and the fact that the}} Shuey Model is open loop.

40|$|The {{socio-economic}} benefits anticipated {{with the}} use and production of nanomaterial and nanoparticles in consumer products {{are linked to the}} fulfillment of the requirement for sustainability during the whole material life cycle. Engineered nanoparticles (ENP) can be of environmental concern, both due to the possible hazardous effects but also due to the differences in properties compared to regular chemicals, e. g. elevated surface area per mass of nanoparticle, the possibility for enhanced mobility and trespassing biological membranes and other emerging novel properties at the nanoscale. There is a scientific consensus that nanoparticles, nanomaterials and their transformation products have a high probability to be released in the environment. ENP in the aquatic environment present a very dynamic behavior that has to be understood in order to perform a physicochemical-based risk assessment that elucidates their transformation and transport leading to the possibility to predict environmental concentrations and exposure. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} adequate theoretical and experimental platforms that can be used for supporting the adequate assessment of fate processes of ENP in the environment. The main results achieved in the thesis were reflected in: 1) <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> theoretical <b>platforms</b> that can provide solutions for the evaluation of fate processes of ENP in aquatic environments 2) improvement in the application of a novel particle tracking method for characterizing natural nanoparticles and ENP in different matrices; 3) <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> the effects of well-characterized NOM and counterion valence on the aggregation rates of TiO 2 nanoparticles 4) developing a geographically distributed water classification for Europe based on river water chemistry, 5) use the geographical water classification to evaluate the aggregation and sedimentation of Au NP in in-situ quiescent-water microcosms. The physicochemical characteristics of the receiving water were found to be very influential on the fate of the ENP tested. The ionic concentration, presence of divalent counter ions (specifically calcium), the type of NOM and mass-ratio between NOM and the particles are among the most important parameters. NP coating, surface charge, material properties and shape will also play very important roles.

40|$|Introduction: The {{answer to}} the {{frequently}} asked question “how open is a software platform” is not binary; {{especially when it comes}} to software platforms for mobile devices. The openness <b>of</b> these <b>platforms</b> is determined by the openness strategy of a software producing organization. The decision to open up a platform, however, determines the degree of freedom for third parties to adopt the platform for commercial opportunities. Objective: The aim of this thesis is <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> the openness strategies of the main mobile platforms based on their architecture. Methodology: The openness strategies are uncovered using literature review and several qualitative interviews with mobile application developers.

40|$|Technology {{adoption}} {{analysis is}} one of the key exercises in managing technology innovation and diffusion. In this paper, we present a service platform for technology adoption analysis, with aim tailored to provide service provisioning to potential technology users and providers. With two service models provided in this platform, a practical privacy preserving framework is developed to help relieve privacy concerns <b>of</b> the <b>platform</b> participants. To illustrate the feasibility of the privacy preserving framework <b>of</b> this <b>platform,</b> an adoption process for RFID technology adoption analysis in logistics and supply chain management is presented to identify key sensitive attributes for background knowledge leading to unique <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> an individual or company. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|The GRADe {{study has}} {{investigated}} attitude determination areas offering potential improvements in ADCS cost, robustness and performance, with applicability across {{a range of}} mission types. The primary areas of investigation were: Use of low mass/cost sensors based on Micro Systems Technology (MST). Improved attitude determination algorithms to combine available data from a number of disparate attitude sensors. Candidate MST gyro sensors and an enhanced quaternion estimation algorithm were investigated in detail, having potential applicability as a viable alternative to the use of conventional sensors and algorithms, while also demonstrating graceful degradation and improved robustness. Purpose and Scope The objective {{of the study was to}} identify and investigate advanced estimation and data fusion concepts, in combination with new sensor technologies, with potential applicability to spacecraft attitude determination. The study focussed on: Achieving existing levels of performance with a reduction in cost. Improving robustness of the attitude determination system, in particular in the presence of poor quality data or changing sensor availability. Of particular interest is the ability to exhibit graceful degradation under sensor failure. In order to achieve these objectives, the initial phase of the study covered the following: Investigation of candidate sensor technologies and estimation techniques. Preliminary definition and assessment of the preferred approach. <b>Identification</b> <b>of</b> an example <b>platform</b> suitable for use as the basis of a future on-ground demonstration, using real sensor telemetry. This paper presents the results and conclusions of this initial phase of the GRADe study...|$|R
40|$|This article {{draws on}} van Dijck and Poell’s {{framework}} of social media logic to examine two platform news functionalities: Facebook Trending Topics and Twitter Moments. It uses the walkthrough method to investigate their technical features while also examining how they fit into platforms’ economic interests and regulatory processes. While {{the framework of}} social media logic enables the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> platforms’ influential elements – programmability, popularity, connectivity and datafication – embedded in news functionalities, a fifth element becomes apparent. The logic of automation naturalises these elements into processes of news distribution through claims that platform news functionalities are free from human intervention. By perpetuating the logic <b>of</b> automation, <b>platforms</b> position themselves as neutral conduits of news information. Expanding the framework of social media logic to include automation enables future analysis <b>of</b> <b>platform</b> developers’ evasion <b>of</b> accountability for shaping social and institutional processes, supported through their claims to produce unbiased automated technologies...|$|R
