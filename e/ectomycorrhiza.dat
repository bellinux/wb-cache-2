5|$|Over {{the course}} of his career, Moser {{collected}} over 25,000 mycological specimens. He first described around 420 Cortinarius species and around 80 other species, including both agarics and boletes. He circumscribed three new genera: Singeromyces (1966), Stephanopus (1975) and Anamika (2002). Much of his research covered four key areas: the taxonomy of Agaricales—including the classical morphotaxonomy and the chemotaxonomy of the order—the toxicity of the chemical constituents of members of the same order, and the ecology of <b>ectomycorrhiza.</b>|$|E
5|$|Inocybe cookei, {{commonly}} known as the straw fibrecap, is a species of mushroom in the Inocybaceae family. It was first described in 1892 by Giacomo Bresadola, and is named in honour of Mordecai Cubitt Cooke. The species can be found in Europe, Asia and North America. It produces small mushrooms of an ochre colour, with a prominent umbo, fibres on the cap and a distinctive bulb {{at the base of the}} stem. It grows from soil in mixed woodland, and is encountered in summer and autumn, though is not common. Ecologically, it feeds through use of <b>ectomycorrhiza.</b> Inocybe cookei has been described as both toxic and non-toxic, but either way, is not advised for consumption.|$|E
40|$|Recently, it was {{hypothesized}} that <b>ectomycorrhizas</b> hyphae are involved in mineral tunneling. We evaluated the role of <b>ectomycorrhizas</b> in mineral weathering and the ecosystem influx of basic cations by correlating mineral tunnel density to <b>ectomycorrhizas</b> density in two forest productivity gradients. The gradients, two gentle slopes in northern Sweden, are the result of groundwater movement and are characterized by reduced productivity upslope due to lower nitrogen availability. As expected, <b>ectomycorrhizas</b> density in the O horizon was higher upslope, where nitrogen availability was lower and where the vegetation was dominated by <b>ectomycorrhizas</b> plant species. We consistently found that tunnel formation in mineral grains was more intense in nutrient-poor sites, indicating a higher contribution of fungi to ecosystem influx of potassium and calcium. <b>ectomycorrhizas</b> density was positively correlated with feldspar tunnel density in the upper 2 cm of the E horizon. This suggests that <b>ectomycorrhizas</b> are involved in mineral tunneling. We discuss the possible involvement of cricoid mycorrhizas and saprotrophic fungi in feldspar tunneling {{and the role of the}} weathering status of mineral grains as additional factors controlling mineral funneling...|$|R
40|$|<b>Ectomycorrhizae</b> play {{important}} role in functioning of forest ecosystems where they are {{also one of the}} major carbon sinks. Physiological activity of vital cells in <b>ectomycorrhizae</b> was studied by using fluorescein diacetate (FDA) and fluorescence microscopy. Fluorescence activity of ectomycorrhizal mantels depends on physiological state of trees and species composition of fungi. Ectomycorrhizal root tips of Siberian spruce (Picea obovata) and Scotch pine (Pinus sylvestris) were sampled in different boreal forest sites in European part of Russia (the Komi Republic) during one growing season. Tissue fluorescence activity was estimated for nine ectomycorrhizal types of Scotch pine and for seven ectomycorrhizal types of Siberian spruce. Certain differences occurred among ectomycorrhizal types in FDA-hydrolysing activity of the different tissue layers of mycorrhizae: cortex, hyphal mantel, Hartig net and stele. All main tissues of coniferous <b>ectomycorrhizae</b> with plectenchimatous mantels of type A were characterized by higher fluorescence activity. Fluorescence intensity of fungal mantels in <b>ectomycorrhizae</b> of types В-, Е-, F-, G- and N was lower, but their stele indicated intermediate activity. Low activity of all tissues except for stele was registered in <b>ectomycorrhizae</b> of O-, Q- and RS-types, so these types were classified as inactive <b>ectomycorrhizae.</b> Highest fluorescence of <b>ectomycorrhizae</b> was recorded in period of their maximum growth in seasonal dynamics.

5|$|The fungus forms a tough mat of mycelia in the humus {{and upper}} soil of pine forests. This mycelial mat grows larger with old trees, and can cover {{an area of}} several square meters. These areas {{generally}} lack dwarf shrubs and promote the vigorous growth of mosses; reindeer lichens often occur {{in the center of}} large mats. The presence of the fungus changes the nature of the soil, resulting in a thinner humus layer, decreased groundwater penetration, decreased soil pH, and increases in the level of root respiration as well as the quantity of roots. The fungus also decreases the organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations. Soil with the mycelium becomes more podzolized than the surrounding soil. Similar to some other Hydnellum species, H.ferrugineum is sensitive to the increased nitrogen deposition resulting from clear-cutting, a forestry practice used in some areas of Europe. The fungus forms an unusual type of mycorrhiza with Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) in which the <b>ectomycorrhiza</b> appears normal at {{the leading edge of the}} mycelial mat, but leaves behind dead and atrophied roots at the trailing edge, showing saprophytic tendencies.|$|E
25|$|This type of {{mycorrhiza}} involves {{plants of}} the Ericaceae subfamily Arbutoideae. It is however different from ericoid mycorrhiza and resembles <b>ectomycorrhiza,</b> both functionally {{and in terms}} of the fungi involved. The difference to <b>ectomycorrhiza</b> is that some hyphae actually penetrate into the root cells, making this type of mycorrhiza an ectendomycorrhiza.|$|E
25|$|In a study {{concerning}} a Tilia americana-Tuber borchii <b>ectomycorrhiza,</b> 29 {{volatile organic compounds}} were produced only during the interaction phase between the two partners, suggesting some of these compounds could {{play a role in}} the early stages of the formation of the <b>ectomycorrhiza.</b> Another study on the same ectomycorrhizal association by Menotta et al. showed 58 genes were differentially expressed during the pre-contact phase, most of which were involved in secretory, apical growth, and infection processes. Thus, there appears to be a complex set of molecular changes that occurs even before the fungus and host plant make contact.|$|E
40|$|The {{turnover}} of ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungal biomass represents an important litter input into forest biogeochemical cycles. Cenococcum geophilum is a nearly ubiquitous and often abundant EM fungus, making the turnover dynamics {{of this species}} relevant and important across forest ecosystems. To better understand the turnover dynamics of C geophilum <b>ectomycorrhizas</b> we examined their persistence using minirhizotron imaging and vitality status using a fluorescein diacetate (FDA) stain and contrasted these results with <b>ectomycorrhizas</b> of other EM fungi. <b>Ectomycorrhizas</b> formed by C. geophilum persisted 4 - 10 times longer and exhibited contrasting seasonal patterns of vitality compared to <b>ectomycorrhizas</b> of other EM fungi. Together, this suggests that litter resulting from the death of C geophilum <b>ectomycorrhizas</b> is relatively recalcitrant to decay and may disproportionately influence forest biogeochemical cycles by retarding {{the rate at which}} carbon and nutrients are cycled.

25|$|As {{it becomes}} more {{apparent}} that belowground organisms and functions heavily influence forest productivity, recovery and stability, <b>ectomycorrhiza</b> are becoming a prime focus for conservation ecologists. The recent decline of many species of EcM fungi in Europe has also allowed the importance of EcM disappearance to gain traction in more widespread conservation circles. Many factors are contributing to the decline, including reduced tree vitality, conversion of forests to other uses, pollution and acidification of forest soils.|$|E
25|$|The hyphae {{extending}} outward {{into the}} soil from one <b>ectomycorrhiza</b> {{can serve as a}} source of EcM infection to other nearby plants. This can lead to the formation of common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs), which experiments have shown to culminate in the sharing of carbon and nutrients among the connected host plants in vitro.

500|$|The genera Lactarius, Lactifluus, Multifurca and Russula form a mutualistic ectomycorrhizal root {{symbiosis}} {{with trees}} and shrubs, exchanging mineral nutrients for photosynthetic sugar.

500|$|Lactarius deterrimus has {{traditionally}} been considered to have a strict mycorrhizal host specificity with Norway spruce. In 2006, {{it was reported that}} the fungus can also form arbutoid mycorrhiza with bearberry (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi). Arbutoid mycorrhizal associations are variants of <b>ectomycorrhiza</b> found in certain plants in the Ericaceae characterised by hyphal coils in epidermal cells. The mycorrhiza formed by L.deterrimus on both bearberry and Norway spruce show typical features such as a hyphal mantle and a Hartig net; the distinguishing characteristic between the mycorrhizal symbioses with the different hosts is that the hyphae penetrate the epidermal cells of bearberry, although there are also some differences {{in the form of the}} Hartig net, branching pattern, and colour. Although bearberry [...] has been shown to form mycorrhiza with a wide range of fungi both in the field and in laboratory experiments, it had never previously been known to form mycorrhiza with fungi thought to be strictly host-specific.

500|$|Paxillus involutus forms ectomycorrhizal {{relationships}} {{with a number}} of coniferous and deciduous tree species. Because the fungus has somewhat unspecialised nutrient requirements and a relatively broad host specificity, it has been frequently used in research and seedling inoculation programs. There is evidence of the benefit to trees of this arrangement: in one experiment where P.involutus was cultivated on the root exudate of red pine (Pinus resinosa), the root showed markedly increased resistance to pathogenic strains of the ubiquitous soil fungus Fusarium oxysporum. Seedlings inoculated with P.involutus also showed increased resistance to Fusarium. Thus P.involutus [...] may be producing antifungal compounds which protect the host plants from root rot. Paxillus involutus also decreases the uptake of certain toxic elements, acting as a buffer against heavy metal toxicity in the host plant. For example, the fungus decreased the toxicity of cadmium and zinc to Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) seedlings: even though cadmium itself inhibits <b>ectomycorrhiza</b> formation in seedlings, colonization with P.involutus decreases cadmium and zinc transport to the plant shoots and alters the ratio of zinc transported to the roots and shoots, causing more cadmium to be retained in the roots of the seedlings rather than distributed through its entire metabolism. Evidence suggests that the mechanism for this detoxification involves the cadmium binding to the fungal cell walls, as well as accumulating in the vacuolar compartments. Further, ectomycorrhizal hyphae exposed to copper or cadmium drastically increase production of a metallothionein—a low molecular weight protein that binds metals.|$|E
