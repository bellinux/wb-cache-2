5|$|The reserve <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> some scarce {{breeding}} birds, such as pied avocets on the islands, {{and western}} marsh harriers, Eurasian bitterns and bearded reedlings in the reeds. To encourage bitterns to breed, the reed beds have been improved {{to make them}} wetter, and the lagoon has been stocked with the common rudd. Typical wetland birds such as the water rail, reed warbler and sedge warbler also appear, and little egrets are common. The reserve has regularly attracted rarities, as its location <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> migrating birds. Ducks and geese winter at Titchwell in considerable numbers, and the reserve shelters the endangered European water vole.|$|E

5|$|Gastric acid acts as {{a barrier}} against {{microorganisms}} to prevent infections and <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> the digestion of food. Its low pH denatures proteins and thereby makes them susceptible to degradation by digestive enzymes such as pepsin. The low pH also activates the enzyme precursor pepsinogen into the active enzyme pepsin by self-cleavage. After leaving the stomach, the hydrochloric acid of the chyme is neutralized in the duodenum by sodium bicarbonate.|$|E
5|$|Gaze following, or shared gaze, can {{be found}} in a number of primates. Domesticated animals such as dogs and horses also {{demonstrate}} shared gaze. This type of joint attention <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> animals because gaze shifts serve as indicators alerting the animal to the location of predators, mates, or food.|$|E
5|$|Glyphs are {{inscribed in}} a {{vertical}} orientation, {{even if the}} object depicted (e.g. fish, Orion’s belt) is usually seen horizontally.

5|$|In {{addition}} to RNA processing, turnover and surveillance activities, the exosome <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> {{the degradation of}} so-called cryptic unstable transcripts (CUTs) that are produced from thousands of loci within the yeast genome. The importance of these unstable RNAs and their degradation are still unclear, but similar RNA species have also been detected in human cells.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} mouse embryo, cytoplasmic {{polyadenylation}} of maternal RNAs from the egg cell allows the cell {{to survive and}} grow even though transcription does not start {{until the middle of}} the 2-cell stage (4-cell stage in human). In the brain, cytoplasmic polyadenylation is active during learning and could play a role in long-term potentiation, which is the strengthening of the signal transmission from a nerve cell to another in response to nerve impulses and <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> learning and memory formation.|$|E

5|$|Lung cancers are {{classified}} according to histological type. This classification <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> determining management and predicting {{outcomes of the}} disease. Lung cancers are carcinomas—malignancies that arise from epithelial cells. Lung carcinomas are categorized by the size and appearance of the malignant cells seen by a histopathologist under a microscope. For therapeutic purposes, two broad classes are distinguished: non-small-cell lung carcinoma and small-cell lung carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|Surveys {{are needed}} to {{determine}} existing population densities and habitat viability for all species of slow loris. Connectivity between protected areas <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> slow lorises {{because they are not}} adapted to dispersing across the ground over large distances. For successful reintroductions, connectivity between sites with low population density is considered ideal. Protected area extensions are also needed in Borneo, Java, and Sumatra.|$|E

5|$|The poly(A) tail <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> {{the nuclear}} export, translation, and {{stability}} of mRNA. The tail is shortened over time, and, when it is short enough, the mRNA is enzymatically degraded. However, in a few cell types, mRNAs with short poly(A) tails are stored for later activation by re-polyadenylation in the cytosol. In contrast, when polyadenylation occurs in bacteria, it promotes RNA degradation. This is also sometimes the case for eukaryotic non-coding RNAs.|$|E

There are also several nationally or locally scarce invertebrates and plants specialised for this coastal habitat. It has five bird hides and an environmentally friendly visitor centre and further expansion is planned through the acquisition of neighbouring land and improvements to visitor facilities.|$|E
