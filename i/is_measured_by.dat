5|$|Beer is {{measured}} and assessed by bitterness, by strength and by colour. The perceived bitterness <b>is</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> the International Bitterness Units scale (IBU), defined in co-operation between the American Society of Brewing Chemists and the European Brewery Convention. The international scale was a {{development of the}} European Bitterness Units scale, often abbreviated as EBU, and the bitterness values should be identical.|$|E
5|$|Climate is the {{statistics}} of weather {{over long periods}} of time. It <b>is</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region {{over long periods of}} time. Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region.|$|E
5|$|Osmium {{is usually}} {{sold as a}} minimum 99.9% pure powder. Like other {{precious}} metals, it <b>is</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> troy weight and by grams. Its price in 2012 was about $400 per troy ounce (or about $13,000 per kilogram), depending on the quantity and its supplier.|$|E

5|$|A country's {{external}} wealth <b>is</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> {{the value}} of its foreign assets net of its foreign liabilities. A current account surplus (and corresponding financial account deficit) indicates an increase in external wealth while a deficit indicates a decrease. Aside from current account indications of whether a country is a net buyer or net seller of assets, shifts in a nation's external wealth are influenced by capital gains and capital losses on foreign investments. Having positive external wealth means a country is a net lender (or creditor) in the world economy, while negative external wealth indicates a net borrower (or debtor).|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{define the}} {{metallicity}} {{of a star}} as the abundance of chemical elements that have a higher atomic number than helium. This <b>is</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> a spectroscopic analysis of the atmosphere, followed by a comparison with the results expected from computed stellar models. In the case of IK Pegasus A, the estimated metal abundance is  = +0.07 ± 0.20. This notation gives the logarithm of the ratio of metal elements (M) to hydrogen (H), minus the logarithm of the Sun's metal ratio. (Thus if the star matches the metal abundance of the Sun, this value will be zero.) A logarithmic value of 0.07 is equivalent to an actual metallicity ratio of 1.17, so the star is about 17% richer in metallic elements than the Sun. However {{the margin of error}} for this result is relatively large.|$|E
5|$|During {{conversations with}} characters, Mass Effect employs a radial command menu, called Dialogue Wheel, where the player's {{dialogue}} options depend on wheel direction. The {{left side of}} the wheel is normally reserved for options that will continue the conversation in depth, while options on the right side tend to move the conversation towards completion. Responses at the top are generally more polite and selfless, while those at the bottom are more aggressive and hostile. Dialogue choices impact how others react to Shepard and affect the player's chosen morality. Morality <b>is</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> Paragon (charm) and Renegade (intimidate) points. These points allow the player to develop talents that affect the availability of new special Paragon and Renegade dialogue options with significant impact in the game.|$|E
30|$|Based on {{two major}} {{categories}} of classical emotion theories: {{cognitive and somatic}} [27], the subject’s emotional responses <b>were</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> physiological signals and subjective feeling. In the experiment, the subject’s physiological responses <b>were</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> PPI VLF/HF ratio, GSR startles, and EEG beta/alpha index. The subject’s affective responses <b>were</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> asking subjective feeling in post-test surveys.|$|R

5|$|Games {{last longer}} than their defined length due to play {{stoppages}} – the average NFL game lasts slightly over three hours. Time in a football game <b>is</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> the game clock. An operator is responsible for starting, stopping and operating the game clock based on {{the direction of the}} appropriate official. A separate clock, the play clock, is used to determine if a delay of game infraction has been committed. If the play clock expires before the ball has been snapped or free-kicked, a delay of game foul is called on the offense. The play clock is set to 40 seconds in professional and college football and to 25 seconds in high school play or following certain administrative stoppages in the former levels of play.|$|E
5|$|Like its predecessor, Super Smash Bros. Melee {{differs from}} {{traditional}} fighting games as {{the objective is}} to force their opponents beyond the boundaries of the stage. Most attacks inflict damage and can, if enough damage is dealt, knock back the enemy. Each character's health <b>is</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> a meter that represents the damage received as a percentage. The higher the percentage value, the farther the player gets knocked back, and the easier they are to knock off the stage, which will result in the character's death and the loss of a stock, or life. Unlike other games of the same genre, in which moves are entered by button-input combinations, most moves in Super Smash Bros. Melee can be accessed via one-button presses and a joystick direction.|$|E
5|$|Morality <b>is</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> Paragon (charm) and Renegade (intimidate) points. These points {{affect the}} {{availability}} of new special Paragon and Renegade dialogue options with significant impact in the game. For example, the game features some missions to gain the loyalty of the squad. What the player does during one of these missions will determine whether they gain the loyalty of a squad member, which in turn will unlock a special power and also help in the final battle. Endings range from the entire team surviving to the entire team being killed, Shepard included, and everything in between. Upon completing the game, a New Game Plus option is unlocked, allowing players to replay the game using the same character with which they finished it.|$|E

5|$|Radial {{velocity}} <b>is</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> the {{doppler shift}} of the star's spectral lines, and is given in units of km/s. The proper motion of a star, its parallax, is determined by precise astrometric measurements in units of milli-arc seconds (mas) per year. With knowledge of the star's parallax and its distance, the proper motion velocity can be calculated. Together with the radial velocity, the total velocity can be calculated. Stars with high rates of proper motion {{are likely to be}} relatively close to the Sun, making them good candidates for parallax measurements.|$|E
5|$|The Ising {{model is}} used to model the {{behavior}} of magnetic systems. It consists of an array of cells, the state of each of which represents a spin, either up or down. The energy of the system <b>is</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> a function {{that depends on the}} number of neighboring pairs of cells that have the same spin as each other. Therefore, if a cell has equal numbers of neighbors in the two states, it may flip its own state without changing the total energy. However, such a flip is energy-conserving only if no two adjacent cells flip at the same time.|$|E
5|$|The LIRGs that host {{hydroxyl}} megamasers may {{be distinguished}} {{from the general population}} of LIRGs by their molecular gas content. The majority of molecular gas is molecular hydrogen, and typical hydroxyl megamaser hosts have molecular gas densities greater than 1000cm−3. These densities are among the highest mean densities of molecular gas among LIRGs. The LIRGs that host hydroxyl megamasers also have high fractions of dense gas relative to typical LIRGs. The dense gas fraction <b>is</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> the ratio of the luminosity produced by hydrogen cyanide (HCN) relative to the luminosity of carbon monoxide (CO).|$|E
30|$|Physicochemical {{parameters}} of the studied wastewater such as pH, EC, temperature, turbidity, total suspended solids (TSS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD 5) and color were analyzed by using standard methods (APHA 2005).

5|$|The central {{concept of}} natural {{selection}} is the evolutionary fitness of an organism. Fitness <b>is</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> an organism's ability to survive and reproduce, which determines {{the size of its}} genetic contribution to the next generation. However, fitness {{is not the same as}} the total number of offspring: instead fitness is indicated by the proportion of subsequent generations that carry an organism's genes. For example, if an organism could survive well and reproduce rapidly, but its offspring were all too small and weak to survive, this organism would make little genetic contribution to future generations and would thus have low fitness.|$|E
5|$|The {{island has}} three endemic species of tree, the Arran {{whitebeam}}s. These trees are the Scottish or Arran whitebeam (Sorbus arranensis), the bastard mountain ash or cut-leaved whitebeam (Sorbus pseudofennica) and the Catacol whitebeam (Sorbus pseudomeinichii). If rarity <b>is</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> numbers alone they are amongst the most endangered tree {{species in the}} world. They are protected in Glen Diomhan off Glen Catacol, {{at the north end}} of the island by a partly fenced off national nature reserve, and are monitored by staff from Scottish Natural Heritage. Only 236 Sorbus pseudofennica and 283 Sorbus arranensis were recorded as mature trees in 1980. They are typically trees of the mountain slopes, close to the tree line. However, they will grow at lower altitudes, and are being preserved within Brodick Country Park.|$|E
5|$|The {{search for}} Gliese 3634 b {{started with a}} single {{exposure}} taken with HARPS on March 25, 2009. The results helped verify that Gliese 3634 was an ideal target for a planet search using the radial velocity method (in which the gravitational pull of a planet on its star <b>is</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> observing the resulting Doppler shift), as stellar activity would not overly mask or mimic Doppler spectroscopy measurements. It was also confirmed that Gliese 3634 is neither a binary star nor a quickly rotating star, common false positives when searching for transiting planets. Gliese 3634 was observed two weeks later for ten consecutive nights. Analysis of the resulting data found that the radial velocity variations most likely indicated {{the existence of a}} planet.|$|E

5|$|As {{many of the}} {{clinical}} {{signs and symptoms of}} ethylene glycol poisoning are nonspecific and occur in many poisonings the diagnosis is often difficult. It is most reliably diagnosed by the measurement of the blood ethylene glycol concentration. Ethylene glycol in biological fluids can be determined by gas chromatography. Many hospital laboratories do not have the ability to perform this blood test {{and in the absence of}} this test the diagnosis must be made based on {{the clinical}} presentation of the patient. In this situation a helpful test to diagnose poisoning is the measurement of the osmolal gap. The patients' serum osmolality <b>is</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> freezing point depression and then compared with the predicted osmolality based on the patients' measured sodium, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, and any ethanol that may have been ingested. The presence of a large osmolal gap supports a diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning. However, a normal osmolar gap does not rule out ethylene glycol exposure because of wide individual variability.|$|E
5|$|Pressure {{readings}} from John's peak are not consistently available as the CPHC did not monitor pressures at the time, but Air Force Reserve aircraft did measure a surface pressure of 929 mbar (hPa), making John {{one of the}} most intense hurricanes recorded in the central Pacific; both Hurricane Emilia and Hurricane Gilma recorded a lower pressure in the central Pacific earlier in the 1994 season, but with lower wind speeds. (Intensity <b>is</b> <b>measured</b> <b>by</b> minimum central pressure, which correlates with but is not directly linked to wind speeds). John was also only the fourth Category5 hurricane recorded in the central Pacific (the first was Hurricane Patsy in 1959, the second was Hurricane Emilia and the third one was Hurricane Gilma, both earlier in 1994), and possessed the highest recorded wind speed in a central Pacific hurricane, 175mph (280km/h). Since 1994, only one Category5 hurricane, Hurricane Ioke, has formed in or entered into the Central Pacific; Ioke, like Emilia and Gilma, had a lower central pressure but lower wind speeds than John. However, John's pressure record is incomplete; the 929mbar reading was only measured when the winds were 160mph; there is no pressure reading when it had winds of 175mph, so it could have been stronger than Emilia, Gilma or Ioke. John was the first Eastern Pacific hurricane to also exist as a typhoon, a feat only matched by Hurricane Genevieve in 2014.|$|E
