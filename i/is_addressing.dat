He is shown as a charioteer, notably when he <b>is</b> <b>addressing</b> the Pandava prince Arjuna character, symbolically reflecting the events that led to the Bhagavad Gitaa scripture of Hinduism. In these popular depictions, Krishna appears in the front as the charioteer, either as a counsel listening to Arjuna, or as the driver of the chariot while Arjuna aims his arrows in the battlefield of Kurukshetra.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} ways in which this biparental sex role specialization can be influenced was studied by manipulating the presence and absence of the mate as well as the presence and absence of an intruder. The former variable was considered because the specialization of parental roles only occurs when both parents are present, while the latter variable was considered because it is thought that biparental care in these cichlids was an evolutionary consequence of the protection of offspring from intruders. When both mates are present with no intruder, both parents may stay with the offspring by resembling single parents because each parent <b>is</b> <b>addressing</b> only the offspring and not its mate, or one parent may be concentrated on activities associated with the offspring while the other parent concentrates on patrolling and defending the area. Under these isolated conditions, a more equal sharing of parental behaviors tends to occur. However, when both mates are present and an intruder is introduced, the male spends more time chasing intruders while the female remains with the offspring more. When the intruder is present but a parent is by itself, the widowed male tends to leave the offspring unattended and instead attacks the intruder or predator. Therefore, the conclusive finding is that the male rarely remains with the offspring when the female is absent, and the female rarely confronts the intruder when the male is absent.|$|E

500|$|Harrison {{wrote and}} {{recorded}} [...] "Don't Let Me Wait Too Long" [...] {{during a period}} marked by his heightened devotion to Hindu spirituality, which coincided with marital problems with his first wife, Pattie Boyd, and the financial complications affecting his Bangladesh aid project.

Adorno concluded that astrology is a large-scale manifestation of systematic irrationalism, where individuals are subtly led—through flattery and vague generalisations—to believe that the author of the column <b>is</b> <b>addressing</b> them directly.

500|$|Over the two bridges, Harrison {{presents}} a more engaged perspective. He states that he's [...] "too much in love", but had {{he and his}} lover met [...] "some other day", the outcome might have been different.
