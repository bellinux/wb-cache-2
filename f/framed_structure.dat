5|$|Shalden {{contains}} twelve Grade II listed buildings, {{in addition}} to one Grade II* listed building. St Peter and St Paul's church is a Grade II building, and the Manor Farmhouse in Shalden Lane is a Grade II* building. The Manor Farmhouse a late-medieval hall house, built with a timber <b>framed</b> <b>structure</b> that covers two stories, dates from the 16th century, with early 19th-century cladding and 20th-century extensions. The house has a boarded door and a large porch. Inside are two wide fireplaces and {{a room with a}} Tudor arch. Shalden Lodge, another Grade II building, dates from the late 18th century, with early and late 19th-century alterations and additions.|$|E
5|$|Sale is {{a diverse}} {{community}} with a synagogue and Christian churches of various denominations. The church buildings were mostly constructed in the late 19th or early 20th century {{in the wake of}} the population boom created by the arrival of the railway in 1849, although records show that the Church of St Martin in Ashton upon Mersey dates back to at least 1304. Before the English Reformation, the inhabitants of Sale were predominantly Catholic, but afterwards were members of the Church of England. Roman Catholics returned to the area in the 19th century in the form of Irish immigrants. Two of the three Grade II* listed buildings in the town are churches. The Church of St Martin, which was probably originally an early 14th-century timber <b>framed</b> <b>structure,</b> was rebuilt in 1714 after the church had been destroyed in a storm. The Church of St John the Divine was built in 1868, to the design of Alfred Waterhouse. There are three Grade II listed churches in Sale: the Church of St Anne; the Church of St Mary Magdalene; and the Church of St Paul.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the whole process of the steel reinforced concrete <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> from elastic to elasto-plastic cracking gradually, damage until the collapse, the elasto-plastic finite element analysis theory and ETABS structural analysis software were used, then the spatial three-dimensional truss system model of <b>frame</b> <b>structures</b> was established. Based on the analysis of the elasto-plastic response for the <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> under one-dimensional and two-dimensional earthquake load, the interbedded displacement angle-time curve and horizontal displacement-time curve were obtained.

25|$|The {{library was}} built on a {{rectangular}} plan and subsequent extensions are to the rear. It was designed to resemble a church in a decorated neo-Gothic style with Arts and Crafts details. It is constructed of Cumbrian sandstone, the interior a delicately shaded 'Shawk' stone (from Dalston, varying in colour between sand {{and a range of}} pinks) and the exterior, dark red Barbary stone from Penrith. built around an internal steel <b>framed</b> <b>structure</b> and brick arched flooring. The red 'Barbary plain' sandstone, which Champneys believed 'had every chance of proving durable' for the exterior, was an unusual choice in late Victorian Manchester. It proved relatively successful, as an inspection by Champneys in 1900 revealed little softening by the 'effects of an atmosphere somewhat charged with chemicals' although, by 1909 some repairs were needed.|$|E
500|$|The {{hotel was}} {{situated}} at 3145 Las Vegas Boulevard South, between Desert Inn Road and Sands Avenue. The original name {{for many years}} was Wilbur Clark's Desert Inn. Wilbur Clark, described by Frank Sinatra biographer James Kaplan as a [...] "onetime San Diego bellhop and Reno craps dealer", originally began building the resort with his brother in 1947 with $250,000, but ran out of money. Author Hal Rothman notes that [...] "for nearly two years the <b>framed</b> <b>structure</b> sat in the hot desert sun, looking more like an ancient relic than a nascent casino". Clark approached the Reconstruction Finance Corporation for investment, but it was struggling financially. In 1949, he met with Moe Dalitz, {{the head of the}} notorious Cleveland gang, the Mayfield Road Mob, and Dalitz agreed to fund 75% of the project with $1.3 million, and construction resumed. Much of the financing came from the American National Insurance Company (ANICO), though Clark became the public frontman of the resort while Dalitz remained quietly in the background as the principal owner. The resort would eventually be renamed Desert Inn and was called the [...] "D.I." [...] by Las Vegas locals and regular guests.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> for {{spectrum}} sensing {{in a network}} of secondary users, and optimize the sum throughput of the network under the constraint on the aggregate interference offered by the network to the primary user. We contrast its performance with the traditional Stop And Sense (SAS) <b>frame</b> <b>structure,</b> which involves the secondary users stopping transmissions and sensing for spectrum holes. We obtain near-optimal, easily computable solutions for the sensing duration and sensing thresholds that approximately maximize the secondary throughput under an aggregate interference constraint. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we present a detailed comparison of the two schemes, and characterize the operating regimes where each <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> is preferable over the other. In general when switching latencies are not accounted for, {{we find that the}} proposed Simultaneous Sense and Access (SSA) <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> performs similar to the existing SAS <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> in terms of throughput for all values of primary signal SNR. When switching latencies are accounted for, the SSA <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> offers significantly higher throughput gain for all values of primary SNR. Another advantage of this <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> over a few other existing <b>frame</b> <b>structures</b> when employed in a network of secondary users {{is that it does not}} rely on the data in the previous slot to make decisions about the presence/absence of primary signal in the current slot which makes the <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> ideal for an adhoc network...|$|R

2500|$|The major {{differences}} between the two were in the fuselages. The Zögling had a very simple open frame girder fuselage, the Prüfling a more conventional hexagonal cross section, wood <b>framed</b> <b>structure,</b> ply covered forward from under the wing and fabric covered aft. The wing was supported over the fuselage with a pair of parallel lift struts on each side, bracing it at almost mid-span at the spars to the lower fuselage longerons. The open cockpit was below the wing centre section which was supported by two pairs of cabane struts to the upper fuselage longerons. The forward pair, placed {{just in front of the}} cockpit were single, upright struts but the rear ones, just behind, were each an inverted V-pair. [...] At the centre there was a noticeable gap between the wings, bridged by a short chord wooden link. [...] The horizontal tail was positioned on the upper longerons. with a triangular fin carrying an upright, straight edged balanced rudder which was slightly angled below the heel and extended down to the keel. The Prüfling landed on a rubber sprung skid below the whole forward, ply skinned fuselage, assisted by a very small tailskid.|$|E
2500|$|Naomi Jacobs {{argues that}} [...] "the {{displacement}} [...] {{is exactly the}} point of the novel, which subjects its readers to a shouldering-aside of familiar notions and comfortable perceptions of the world", and both narrations and jarring discrepancies of tone and perspective between them are essential to the purpose. In The Tenant, like in Wuthering Heights, a horrific reality of private life is obtained after passing through the voice of a framing narrator. According to Jacobs, the male narrator represents the public world, and the <b>framed</b> <b>structure</b> serves several functions that are strongly gender-related: it illustrates the process of going behind the official version of reality in order to approach the truth that the culture prefers to deny; it exemplifies the ways in which domestic reality is obscured by layers of conventional ideology; and it replicates the cultural split between male and female spheres that is shown {{to be one of the}} sources of the tragedy in the novel. Jacobs concludes that both Emily and Anne seemed to find it necessary, in approaching subjects that were considered to be controversial, to use the voice of a male narrator, appropriating, delegitimizing and even ridiculing his power, before telling anti-patriarchal truth.|$|E
2500|$|In 1959, two biographies were {{published}}: Anne Brontë, {{her life}} and work by Ada Harrison and Derek Stanford and Anne Brontë by Winifred Gérin. Noting that The Tenant was published some ten years before George Eliot's novels, Harrison and Stanford named Anne the [...] "first realist woman writer" [...] in Great Britain. Unlike some early critics, who considered the scenes of debauchery improbable, Harrison and Stanford believed them to be [...] "described in a fashion which Zola might have admired". Winifred Gérin believed Helen Graham to be [...] "one of the first married women in fiction who is both competent and resolved to keep herself not be any of the accepted means as housekeeper, companion or governess, but as a painter, selling her canvasses to dealers". Despite this, in her later work on the Brontës, Gérin dismissed The Tenant as being [...] "written too obviously {{as a work of}} propaganda, a treatise against drunkenness, to be considered a work of art". Several years later, however, Gérin wrote an introduction to The Tenant, where, while considering the <b>framed</b> <b>structure</b> in both The Tenant and Wuthering Heights a [...] "clumsy devise", acknowledged Anne's [...] "pre-eminent gift of story-teller" [...] and [...] "eloquence in proclaiming the equality of men and women". She believed that The Tenant [...] "might be said to be the first manifesto for 'Women's Lib'". Inga-Stina Ewbank considered Anne the least talented of the sisters and claimed that the framing structure, where [...] "Helen can reveal her innermost being to the diary" [...] while Gilbert is [...] "bound to be as objective as possible", [...] "throws novel out of balance". However, she believed that [...] "through the very nature of its central concern, The Tenant is feminist in the deepest sense of the word".|$|E
40|$|Reinforced-Concrete (R/C) <b>frame</b> <b>structures</b> with {{unreinforced}} {{clay brick}} masonry (URM) infill walls {{are commonly used}} in developing countries with regions of high seismicity.

30|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{behaviors of}} recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> are investigated by numerical simulation method with 3 -D finite fiber elements. The dynamic characteristics and the seismic {{performance of the}} RAC <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> are analyzed and validated with the shaking table test results. Specifically, the natural frequency and the typical responses (e.g., storey deformation, capacity curve, etc.) from Model 1 (exclusion of strain rate effect) and Model 2 (inclusion of strain rate effect) are analyzed and compared. It is revealed that Model 2 {{is more likely to}} provide a better match between the numerical simulation and the shaking table test as key attributes of seismic behaviors of the <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> are captured by this model. For the purpose to examine how seismic behaviors of the RAC <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> vary under different strain rates in a real seismic situation, a numerical simulation is performed by varying the strain rate. The storey displacement response and the base shear for the RAC <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> under different strain rates are investigated and analyzed. It is implied that the structural behavior of the RAC <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> is significantly influenced by the strain rate effect. On one hand, the storey displacements vary slightly in the trend of decreasing with the increasing strain rate. On the other hand, the base shear of the RAC <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> under dynamic loading conditions increases with gradually increasing amplitude of the strain rate.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Frame</b> <b>{{structure}}</b> on a slope is {{a common}} kind of structure in a mountainous area. It can diminish the impact on environment, by avoiding to dug or fill the slope, using an opening platform, supported by beams and columns. Because the <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> on a slope connects with the ground on different elevation level, it is evidently different from general <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> in seismic design. Four sets of <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> example on a slope sample are designed, with three opening floors connected with the ground on different elevation level, and three, six, nine, twelve upper floors correspondingly. The seismic responses characteristics of frames on a slope are studied in the paper from period, lateral deformation, seismic shear and so on, based on {{the analysis of the}} characteristics of <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> on a slope. The main conclusions are as follows: the slope can enhance structural lateral stiffness to a certain extent; the opening floors connected with the ground on different elevation level, are not necessarily frail stories; the distribution of seismic force is uneven between the columns in the same floors which connect with the ground on different elevation level, and fixed columns undertake more than others, making them more fragile; the torsional effect is noticeable in the <b>frame</b> <b>structure</b> on a slope...|$|R
