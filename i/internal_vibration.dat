The passengers for Batu Beru, kneeling on the planks, were engaged in rolling their bedding of mats busily; they tied up bundles, they snapped the locks of wooden chests. A pockmarked peddler of small wares threw his head back to drain into his throat the last drops out of an earthenware bottle before putting it away in a roll of blankets. Knots of traveling traders standing about the deck conversed in low tones; the followers of a small Rajah from down the coast, broad-faced, simple young fellows in white drawers and round white cotton caps with their colored sarongs twisted across their bronze shoulders, squatted on their hams on the hatch, chewing betel with bright red mouths {{as if they had been}} tasting blood. Their spears, lying piled up together within the circle of their bare toes, resembled a casual bundle of dry bamboos; a thin, livid Chinaman, with a bulky package wrapped up in leaves already thrust under his arm, gazed ahead eagerly; a wandering Kling rubbed his teeth with a bit of wood, pouring over the side a bright stream of water out of his lips; the fat Rajah dozed in a shabby deck-chair,--and at the turn of every bend the two walls of leaves reappeared running parallel along the banks, with their impenetrable solidity fading at the top to a vaporous mistiness of countless slender twigs growing free, of young delicate branches shooting from the topmost limbs of hoary trunks, of feathery heads of climbers like delicate silver sprays standing up without a quiver. There was not a sign of a clearing anywhere; not a trace of human habitation, except when in one place, on the bare end of a low point under an isolated group of slender tree-ferns, the jagged, tangled remnants of an old hut on piles appeared with that peculiar aspect of ruined bamboo walls that look as if smashed with a club. Farther on, half hidden under the drooping bushes, a canoe containing a man and a woman, together with a dozen green cocoanuts in a heap, rocked helplessly after the Sofala had passed, like a navigating contrivance of venturesome insects, of traveling ants; while two glassy folds of water streaming away from each bow of the steamer across the whole width of the river ran with her up stream smoothly, fretting their outer ends into a brown whispering tumble of froth against the miry foot of each bank.|$|E

Molecular beam experiments {{have shown that the}} energy in the <b>internal</b> <b>vibrations</b> are about as effective as the translational energy in inducing dissociation. The published wave packet simulations on the methane dissociation reaction on transition metals have treated the methane molecule always as a diatomic up to now. Besides the C-H bond and molecule surface distance, a combination of other coordinates were included, like (multiple) rotations and some lattice motion. None of them have looked at the role of the <b>internal</b> <b>vibrations.</b> We were not able yet to simulate the dissociation including all <b>internal</b> <b>vibrations.</b> Instead we simulated the scattering of methane in fixed orientations, for which all <b>internal</b> <b>vibrations</b> can be included, and used the results to deduce consequences for the dissociation. Furthermore we studied the isotope effect, and the role of vibrational excitations. We ended with classical trajectory calculations of the rotational vibrational scattering of a non-rigid methane molecule from a Ni(111) surface. Energy dissipation and scattering angles have been studied {{as a function of the}} translational kinetic energy, the incident angle, the (rotational) nozzle temperature, and the surface temperature.

40|$|We {{present results}} of {{simulations}} for a dilute gas of inelastically colliding particles.

This allows us to study large systems for long times in the truely inelastic regime. During the cooling stage we observe complex cluster dynamics, as large clusters of particles form, collide and merge or dissolve. Typical clusters are found to survive long enough to establish local equilibrium within a cluster, but not among different clusters. We extend the model to include net dissipation of energy by damping of the <b>internal</b> <b>vibrations.</b> Inelatic collapse is avoided also in this case but in contrast to the conservative system the translational energy decays according to the mean field scaling law, E(t) ∝ t^- 2, for asymptotically long times.

40|$|We {{perform a}} {{detailed}} numerical analysis of soliton–soliton collisions within a standard {{model of the}} nonlinear dual-core optical fiber. We demonstrated that, almost in all the cases, the collisions are very strongly inelastic, typically leading to formation of a breather that demonstrates violent <b>internal</b> <b>vibrations.</b> In particular, if both solitons are asymmetric and from different branches, the asymmetric breather produced by the collision switches between the two cores with the change of the collision velocity. If the colliding solitons are mutually mirror-symmetric, two asymmetric breathers can be produced. In the case when the two colliding asymmetric solitons are from the same branch, a breather is formed again, symmetric if the solitons are identical. In this case, the breather demonstrates extremely strong <b>internal</b> <b>vibrations,</b> compressing itself, from time to time, into very narrow pulses. We also study in detail an interplay between noise, which is always present in the fiber, and the soliton–soliton collisions.

40|$|We {{consider}} a mass-less manifestly covariant linear Schrödinger equation. First, {{we show that}} it possesses a class of non-dispersive soliton solution with finite-size spatio-temporal support inside which the quantum amplitude satisfies the Klein-Gordon equation with finite emergent mass. We then proceed to interpret the soliton wave function as describing a particle with finite mass, energy and momentum. Inside the spatio-temporal support, the wave function shows spatio-temporal <b>internal</b> <b>vibration</b> with angular frequency and wave number that {{are determined by the}} energy-momentum of the particle as firstly conjectured by de Broglie. Imposing resonance of the <b>internal</b> <b>vibration</b> inside the spatio-temporal support leads to Planck-Einstein quantization of energy-momentum. The first resonance mode is shown to recover the classical energy-momentum relation developed in special relativity.
