50|$|The new Secretary sought {{allies in}} Congress to {{implement}} his agenda. One such ally {{was the new}} junior senator from Montana, Thomas J.

5|$|Anti-annexation Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri {{had been}} the only Southern Democrat to vote against the Tyler-Texas measure in June 1844.

As pro-annexation sentiment grew <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>home</b> <b>state,</b> Benton retreated from this compromise offer. By February 5, 1845, in the early debates on the Brown-amended House bill, he advanced an alternative resolution that, unlike the Brown scenario, made no reference whatsoever to the ultimate free-slave apportionment of an annexed Texas and simply called for five bipartisan commissioners to resolve border disputes with Texas and Mexico and set conditions for the Lone Star Republic's acquisition by the United States.|$|E

By the time of the 1886 Congressional elections, Blaine was giving speeches and promoting Republican candidates, especially <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>home</b> <b>state</b> of Maine. Republicans were successful in Maine, and after the Maine elections in September, Blaine went on a speaking tour from Pennsylvania to Tennessee, hoping to boost the prospects of Republican candidates there. Republicans were less successful nationwide, gaining seats in the House while losing seats in the Senate, but Blaine’s speeches kept him and his opinions in the spotlight.|$|E
