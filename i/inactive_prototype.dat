40|$|The present {{research}} linked social comparison processes to prototype models of risk behaviour in predicting physical activity, controlling for perceived health threat and perceived behavioural control. One hundred and forty respondents reported on physical activity, perceived control over physical activity, perceived personal threat resulting from in-activity, preferred {{level of social}} comparison, as well as psychological distancing from (perceived similarity), and favorability of active and in-active prototypes. Results indicated main rather than interactive effects of prototype assessments on physical activity. Prototype similarity rather than prototype favorability consistently predicted physical activity when the <b>inactive</b> <b>prototype</b> was being evaluated. Incorporating level of social comparison, those who made upward comparisons with others who are better at maintaining physical activity (a) perceived active prototypes more similar and inactive prototypes more dissimilar to themselves; (b) had greater perceptions of control over their ability to be active, and had lower perceived health threat. Perceived control consistently predicted physical activity across regression models. Importantly, upward comparisons in assessing physical activity were made by those who were more physically active (Beta =. 46). The findings have implications {{for the use of}} comparison targets in health programs aimed at promoting physical activity...|$|E
30|$|Considering the {{predicted}} cytotoxic activity of modified compounds (Additional file 3) and experimental activity of their prototypes (Table  4), the structural modification of compound 1 reduce cytotoxic activity. The experimental inactive compounds (2 and 7) afforded modified compounds (2 A– 2 R and 7 A– 7 R) that possessed weakly to inactive cytotoxic activity. Although the tested compound 8 contains aromatic ester, which {{is represented by}} nArCOOR descriptor value, it {{was found to be}} experimentally inactive. However, the improved activities of modified compounds in series 8 (8 A– 8 R) were predicted when compared to their <b>inactive</b> <b>prototype</b> (8). Notably, the ester 8 N (pIC 50 0.054) was noted as the most potent compound among all modified compound series. It was observed that particular forms (opened/closed chain), substituents R (phenoxyester), R 1 (H, OH, OCH 3) and R 2 (1 -adamantyl, phenyl) on the meta- and para- triazoles influence the R 5 e+ value of the compounds in governing their cytotoxic activities. For both para- and meta- modified compounds in series 8, closed chain analogs (8 E, 8 G, 8 N and 8 P) were predicted to exhibit more potent cytotoxic activity (indicated by pIC 50 value) than opened chain analogs (8 A, 8 C, 8 J and, 8 K) and the 1 -adamantyl (R 2) derivatives (8 H and 8 R) were predicted to be more active than phenyl (R 2) derivatives (8 D and 8 M). In case of the opened chain analogs (8 A, 8 B, 8 C, 8 J, 8 K and 8 L), most of the compounds with para-triazole were predicted as more potent compounds than the compounds with meta-triazole as indicated by pIC 50 values i.e., 8 A (− 0.618) >  8 J (− 1.038) and 8 B (− 0.786) >  8 K (− 1.122) except for the case of phenyl (R 2) compounds in which the large improved activity of meta-triazole 8 M (− 0.618) was observed as compared to the para-triazole 8 D (− 2.466). In contrast, the closed chain meta-triazole compounds (8 N and 8 P) and 1 -adamantyl meta-triazole compound (8 R, pIC 50 − 0.282) were found to exhibit more potent activity than the corresponding closed chain para-triazoles (8 E and 8 F, pIC 50 − 0.114 and − 0.786, respectively) and 1 -adamantyl (R 2) para-triazole compound (8 H, pIC 50 − 0.702).|$|E
40|$|From the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) inventory, {{thirteen}} 8 -aminoquinoline analogs of primaquine {{were selected}} for screening against a panel of seven Plasmodium falciparum clones and isolates. Six of the 13 8 -aminoquinolines had average 50 % inhibitory concentrations between 50 and 100 nM against these P. falciparum clones and were thus {{an order of magnitude}} more potent than primaquine. However, excluding chloroquine-resistant clones and isolates, these 8 -aminoquinolines were all an order of magnitude less potent than chloroquine. None of the 8 -aminoquinolines was cross resistant with either chloroquine or mefloquine. In contrast to the <b>inactive</b> primaquine <b>prototype,</b> 8 of the 13 8 -aminoquinolines inhibited hematin polymerization more efficiently than did chloroquine. Although alkoxy or aryloxy substituents at position 5 uniquely endowed these 13 8 -aminoquinolines with impressive schizontocidal activity, the structural specificity of inhibition of both parasite growth and hematin polymerization was low...|$|R
40|$|In {{contrast}} to canonical phage endolysins, which require holin-mediated {{disruption of the}} membrane {{to gain access to}} attack the cell wall, signal anchor release (SAR) endolysins are secreted by the host sec system, where they accumulate in an inactive form tethered to the membrane by their N-terminal SAR domains. SAR endolysins become activated by various mechanisms upon release from the membrane. In its <b>inactive</b> form, the <b>prototype</b> SAR endolysin, LyzP 1, of coliphage P 1, has an active-site Cys covalently blocked by a disulfide bond; activation involves a disulfide bond isomerization driven by a thiol in the newly released SAR domain, unblocking the active-site Cys. Here, we report that Lyz 103, the endolysin of Erwinia phage ERA 103, is also a SAR endolysin. Although Lyz 103 does not have a catalytic Cys, genetic evidence suggests that it also is activated by a thiol-disulfide isomerization triggered by a thiol in the SAR domain. In this case, the inhibitory disulfide in nascent Lyz 103 is formed between cysteine residues flanking a catalytic glutamate, caging the active site. Thus, LyzP 1 and Lyz 103 define subclasses of SAR endolysins that differ in the nature of their inhibitory disulfide, and Lyz 103 is the first enzyme found to be regulated by disulfide bond caging of its active site. In infections by double-stranded DNA phages, host lysis requires degradation of the peptidoglycan by a phage-encoded endolysin (17). By far the most intensively studied endolysin i...|$|R
