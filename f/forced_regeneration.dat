40|$|The {{effect of}} rapid {{shortening}} on rate of <b>force</b> <b>regeneration</b> (dF/dtR) was examined in single, intact frog (Rana temporaria) skeletal muscle fibres (3 · 0 °C). Step releases leading to unloaded shortening were applied after 500 ms of stimulation, during the plateau of an isometric tetanus. Initial mean sarcomere length ranged from 2 · 05 to 2 · 35 μm; <b>force</b> <b>regeneration</b> after shortening was at 2 · 00 μm. Values for dF/dtR following a 25 nm half-sarcomere− 1 release were 3 · 17 ± 0 · 17 (mean ± s. e. m., n= 8) {{times greater than}} the initial rate of rise of force before release (dF/dtI). As release size was increased from 25 to 175 nm half-sarcomere− 1, the relationship between release size and dF/dtR decreased sharply before attaining a plateau value that was 1 · 34 ± 0 · 09 times greater than dF/dtI. Despite wide variations in dF/dtR, the velocity of unloaded shortening remained constant (2 · 92 ± 0 · 08 μm half-sarcomere− 1 s− 1; n= 8) for the different release amplitudes used in this study. To investigate its role in the attenuation of dF/dtR with increased shortening, the effects of rapid ramp (constant velocity) shortening on intracellular free Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) were monitored using the Ca 2 +-sensitive fluorescent dye furaptra. Compared with an isometric contraction, rapid fibre shortening was associated with a transient increase in [Ca 2 +]i while <b>force</b> <b>regeneration</b> after shortening was associated with a transient reduction in [Ca 2 +]i. The greatest reductions in [Ca 2 +]i were associated with the largest amplitude ramps. Cross-bridge-mediated modifications of the Ca 2 + affinity of troponin C (TnC) may explain the fluctuations in [Ca 2 +]i observed during and after ramps.

Multicast transmission may use network bandwidth {{more efficiently than}} multiple point-to-point connections. Many algorithms have been proposed for generating “good ” multicast trees, however, these algorithms have significant limitations for networks containing mobile hosts. Existing algorithms either do not support changes to the multicast group while building the tree or impose unrealistic restrictions, such as prohibiting overlapping modifications or <b>forcing</b> <b>regeneration</b> of the tree after each change. Clearly, to extend the range of applications that depend on multicast communication to mobile hosts, multicast tree algorithms must provide a flexible means for participants to join and leave the multicast group.

[...] But even if the drawing power is always triumphant, the ability to resist does not depend upon {{the meaning of the word}} [...] "draw" [...] in John 12:32, but on the question what the [...] "draw" [...] is intended to accomplish.

This gave rise in Europe to the forthcoming introduction of an emission standard on total particle number, that will take place for passenger cars from EURO 5 (stage b) on. The behavior of the DPF is therefore under investigation, to better understand its effectiveness toward particle number reduction. Moving from that background, a study on the effect of a close coupled DOC-CDPF (Diesel Oxidation Catalyst + Catalyzed Diesel Particulate Filter) on PM emissions is proposed in this paper, with special focus on the comparison between mass and number collection efficiency. Experimental data have been gathered at the engine laboratory of the University of Rome Tor Vergata, equipped with a FIAT 2. 0 l EURO 5 passenger car engine.

To assess stem cell transduction and epithelial regrowth a forced-injury model was employed {{at a number of}} time points after the gene therapy protocol. Epithelial remodelling in cystic fibrosis and normal airways of mice was also assessed. Airway stem cell hyperplasia and goblet cell hyperplasia and hypertrophy, and epithelial mucin content were assessed in the trachea and in some instance the nasopharynx in the nasal airways of CF and normal mice. Additionally, the effectiveness of the LPC / lentiviral gene therapy protocol was assessed in lung airways of normal ferrets and the marmoset, a non-human primate, to determine if airway transduction of both differentiated ciliated cells and stem cells reflected observations noted in previously-published mouse-based studies. These ferret and marmoset animal studies have been published prior to thesis submission. Airway stem cells transduction was confirmed in the trachea and nasal airways of mice following pre-treatment with LPC and subsequent treatment with a HIV- 1 VSV-G pseudotyped lentiviral vector carrying the LacZ marker gene. A forced injury model was employed to <b>force</b> <b>regeneration</b> of the airway epithelium after vector treatment. Following the ablation and subsequent regeneration of the airway epithelium, clusters of LacZ positive were observed in both the trachea and nasal airways suggesting transduction of the airway stem cells and the passing of the transgene to their progeny upon differentiation. Airway epithelial remodelling was demonstrated in both airway stem cells and goblet cells in CF mice. Hyperplasia of airway stem cells and goblet cells in CF mice was observed. Hypertrophy and change in mucin acidity of goblet cells was also observed. Additionally, remodelling of the cartilage rings in the trachea was observed in CF mice. This is the first study to demonstrate the presence of goblet cell hyperplasia, hypertrophy and change in mucin acidity in the presence of airway stem cell hyperplasia. Importantly, the hyperplasia of airway stem cells in CF airways had previously been proposed however, this is the first study to directly quantitate the airway stem cell compartment using a novel flow cytometry and clonogenic assay approach. Finally, the transduction of airway stem cells and ciliated cells is shown in normal ferrets and marmosets, a non-human primate. Validation of transducing relevant airway cell type in these animals adds to the gene therapy proof of principle foundation previously demonstrated in the airways of mice. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Also, DO places the tissue under tension, a novel mechanical mode for these algorithms. Altogether, this provides an attractive setting for the study of mechanical <b>forces</b> on bone <b>regeneration.</b> ✘ The aim was to simulate bone regeneration during DO, using mechano-regulation based on deviatoric strain and fluid velocity (Prendergast et al. 1997). We hypothesized that this algorithm could be corroborated by th...|$|R
40|$|Growth cones {{facilitate}} the repair of nervous system damage {{by providing the}} driving <b>force</b> for axon <b>regeneration.</b> Using single-neuron laser axotomy and in vivo time-lapse imaging, we show that syndecan, a heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycan, is required for growth cone function during axon regeneration in C.  elegans. In the absence of syndecan, regenerating growth cones form but are unstable and collapse, decreasing the effective growth rate and impeding regrowth to target cells. We provide evidence that syndecan has two distinct functions during axon regeneration: (1) a canonical function in axon guidance that requires expression outside the nervous system and depends on HS chains and (2) an intrinsic function in growth cone stabilization that is mediated by the syndecan core protein, independently of HS. Thus, syndecan is a regulator of a critical choke point in nervous system repair...|$|R
