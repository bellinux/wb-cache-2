A two-tap finite impulse response filter with simple hardware realizes the functions of a 90 Â° phase shift, suppression of the static component and digital delay of up to a few hundred turns for the KEKB rings. Difficulties in the circuit board, such as the trimming of the timing skews or the problem of long-term reliability, have been solved using custom GaAs large-scale integrated circuits which demultiplex and multiplex fast parallel-digital data coming from the analog-to-digital converter {{and going to the}} digital-to-analog converter.

40|$|A "real-time" {{hardware}} reconstruction {{system for}} Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been designed, constructed, and demonstrated. Here, "real-time" corresponds to frame rates of 30 {{or more per}} second (i. e., video rate). The system is capable of reconstructing images via either the 2 D FFT algorithm or the filtered backprojection algorithm. The 2 D FFT hardware reconstructs 256 x 256 images from complex-valued data (on a rectilinear grid) {{at a rate of}} 30 frames/sec while the filtered backprojection hardware is capable of reconstructing 64 x 64 images from complex-valued data (on a polar grid) at a rate of 37 frames/sec. Real-time MRI may be achieved by interfacing the reconstruction system to MR scanners with ultra-fast acquisition capabilities, such as echo-planar imaging (EPI) for rectilinear data or spiral-scan for polar data. The reconstruction system consists of a number of circuit boards plugged into the bus of a personal computer (PC). The circuit boards are configured by the PC, and thereafter, communicate with each other through ribbon cables independent of the PC operation. Three of the circuit boards are common in both reconstruction methods. They are an analog-to-digital convertor board (ADC), an interface memory board (IM), and a display processor board (DP). In the 2 D FFT method a fourth circuit board referred to as the Fourier processor board (FP) is utilized. In the filtered backprojection method two additional circuit boards, a projection <b>filter</b> <b>board</b> (PF) and a backprojection board (BP) are used. The basic theory of the two reconstruction methods as well as design and implementation of the digital-electronic hardware are described in this dissertation.

The method is dedicated to power converters with N active conductors and a ground conductor, followed by passive circuits. A sophisticated use of impedance matrices allows high frequency current prediction. The power system is divided into functional circuits called blocks. Each passive block is modeled by an impedance matrix. A fast matrix calculation permits association of those matrices to obtain a compact model represented by an impedance matrix. Knowing the converter output voltages and the resulting impedance matrix, currents are calculated to study the influence of each passive block on high frequency current spectrum, and so the EMI (electromagnetic interference). This will help for <b>filter</b> and <b>board</b> layout design for a given load.

Standard economic theory predicts that corporate <b>boards</b> <b>filter</b> out exogenous industry and market shocks from firm performance before deciding on CEO retention. Using a new hand-collected sample of 1, 627 CEO turnovers from 1993 to 2001, we document that CEOs are {{significantly more likely}} to be dismissed from their jobs after bad industry or bad market performance.

For each quasar, we collected two deep, narrow-band images, one sampling the Ly-alpha line+continuum at the quasar redshifts {{and one of}} the continuum emission redwards of the line. After carefully modeling the Point Spread Function, we find no evidence for extended Ly-alpha emission. These observations set 2 -sigma limits of L(Ly-alpha, extended) < 3. 2 x 10 ^{ 44 } erg/s for J 1030 + 0524 and L(Ly-alpha, extended) < 2. 5 x 10 ^{ 44 } erg/s for J 1148 + 5251. Given the star formation rates typically inferred from (rest-frame) far-infrared measurements of z~ 6 quasars, these limits are well below the intrinsic bright Ly-alpha emission expected from the recombination of gas photoionized by the quasars or by the star formation in the host galaxies, and point towards significant Ly-alpha suppression or dust attenuation. However, small extinction values have been observed along the line of sight to the nuclei, thus reddening has to be coupled with other mechanisms for Ly-alpha suppression (e. g., resonance scattering).

The ac impedance measurement is not only reflects the battery state of health, but also a crucial parameter for a charging control strategy to reduce the internal thermal rise. The battery ac impedance is achieved with a battery charger by injecting ac ripple current and measuring the ac voltage response with the sinusoidal ripple current (SRC) charging technique. The digital signal processor is used to extract the battery ac ripple content and calculate the impedance magnitude and phase angle. However, it has computational burden due to many signal transformation steps, extracting the ac ripple content, creating the virtual Î±-Î² frame for separating the impedance phase angle, and computational complexity with limited ADC sensing range between 0 to 3 V at 12 -bit resolution.
