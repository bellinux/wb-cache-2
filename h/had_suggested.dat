5|$|Berger later {{claimed that}} he had come {{up with the idea of}} SS combat troops wearing {{camouflage}} jackets from his own hunting days, and <b>had</b> <b>suggested</b> it to SS-Obergruppenführer Sepp Dietrich, commander of the Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler Regiment (LSSAH). From 1938, various forms of Flecktarn camouflage were issued. The author Adrian Weale doubts Berger's account.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} May 16, 1976, though an Associated Press report in August 1975 <b>had</b> <b>suggested</b> filming would start in late 1975. Spielberg {{did not want}} to do any location shooting because of his negative experience on Jaws and wanted to shoot Close Encounters entirely on sound stages, but eventually dropped the idea.|$|E
5|$|Some astronomers <b>had</b> <b>suggested</b> {{that the}} impacts {{might have a}} {{noticeable}} effect on the Io torus, a torus of high-energy particles connecting Jupiter with the highly volcanic moon Io. High resolution spectroscopic studies found that variations in the ion density, rotational velocity, and temperatures {{at the time of}} impact and afterwards were within the normal limits.|$|E
50|$|First, some <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> {{that the}} gas {{chromatograph}} {{may not have}} been sensitive enough to detect the organics. Though other scientists <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> that they could have detected low levels of organics....|$|R
50|$|Bopearachchi <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> that Menander II reigned c. 90-85 BCE, whereas R. C. Senior <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> c. 65 BCE. In that case, Menander II ruled {{remaining}} Indo-Greek territories in Gandhara {{after the}} invasion of Maues.|$|R
50|$|Yanomaman {{is usually}} not {{connected}} with any other language family. Joseph Greenberg <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> a relationship between Yanomaman and Macro-Chibchan. Migliazza (1985) <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> a connection with Panoan and Chibchan. Neither proposal has been accepted.|$|R
5|$|The government's first witness, U.S. Attorneys' Office clerk Gordon Morgan {{testified that}} Glasser <b>had</b> <b>suggested</b> that Sidney S. Eckstone be {{appointed}} foreperson {{of a grand}} jury that returned only eight out of twenty indictments and that Glasser and Eckstone had conferred frequently. Another prosecution witness, illegal distillery landlord William F. Workman, testified that Capone-affiliated Louis Schiavone had posted approximately $1,000,000 in bail bonds.|$|E
5|$|Although {{one of the}} plaintiffs' witnesses, a {{chartered}} land surveyor, <b>had</b> <b>suggested</b> {{that the}} authorities could redevelop the land in a different manner, he did not state that the authorities' redevelopment plan was wrong or indefensible. The court {{was not in a}} position to decide which plans for redeveloping areas in Singapore were better. Thus, the acquisition of the temple property had not infringed Article 12(1) of the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the war, she {{returned}} to her work on the report. She controversially published findings that held that the time period between two occupational levels, Level II (preceding Babylonian conquest by Nebuchadnezzar) and Level III (preceding Assyrian conquest by Sennacherib) was likely to be in the range of 100 years, rather than a decade, as Starkey <b>had</b> <b>suggested.</b> Although the majority held that Starkey's interpretation was more likely, in 1973 subsequent excavations vindicated her opinion.|$|E
50|$|For acute {{low back}} pain, low quality {{evidence}} <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> {{no difference between}} real and sham spine manipulation, and moderate quality evidence <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> no difference between spine manipulation and other commonly used treatments, such as medication and physical therapy.|$|R
50|$|Robert Hetzron <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> {{that the}} Rift {{languages}} (South Cushitic) {{are a part}} of Lowland East Cushitic, and Kießling & Mous (2003) <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> more specifically that they be linked to a Southern Lowland branch, together with Oromo, Somali, and Yaaku-Dullay.|$|R
50|$|The role of Syk in {{epithelial}} malignancies is controversial. Several authors <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> that abnormal Syk function facilitates {{transformation in}} Nasopharyngeal carcinoma and {{head and neck}} cancer while other authors <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> a tumor suppressor role in breast and gastric cancer.|$|R
5|$|British {{journalist}} David Rose {{writes that}} by 1976 the Farm was already {{seen as a}} sink estate, and by 1980 a Department of the Environment report <b>had</b> <b>suggested</b> demolition, although a regeneration project after the 1985 riots led to improvements. Sir Kenneth Newman, Metropolitan Police commissioner from 1982 to 1987, regarded the estate as one of London's symbolic locations, or potential no-go areas, along with Railton Road in Brixton, All Saints Road in Notting Hill, the Notting Hill Carnival, and the Stonebridge Estate in Harlesden. The 1986 Gifford Inquiry into the rioting criticised the police for having adopted this attitude.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Lamberti of Bari <b>had</b> <b>suggested</b> to Goheen in 1976 that Primitivo {{might be}} the Croatian variety Plavac Mali. By 1982 Goheen had {{confirmed}} that they were similar but not identical, probably by isozyme analysis. Some Croatians, however, became convinced that Plavac Mali {{was the same as}} Zinfandel, among them Croatian-born winemaker Mike Grgich. In 1991 Grgich and other producers came together as the Zinfandel Advocates and Producers (ZAP) with the objectives of promoting the varietal and wine, and supporting scientific research on Zinfandel. With this support, UCD professor Carole Meredith went to Croatia and collected over 150 samples of Plavac Mali throughout Dalmatia, in collaboration with the University of Zagreb.|$|E
5|$|During 2008, Tomlinson was {{a witness}} for the inquest into {{the deaths of the}} Princess of Wales and Dodi al Fayed. He <b>had</b> <b>suggested</b> that MI6 was {{monitoring}} Diana before her death and that her driver on the night she died, Henri Paul, may have been an MI6 informant, and that her death resembled plans he saw during 1992 for the assassination of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milošević, using a bright light to cause a traffic accident.|$|E

The latter {{suggestions}} would retain the initial D in DSD.|$|R
40|$|Context: Prenatal {{androgen}} excess {{can cause}} a phenocopy of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in mammals. Retrospective studies <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> that girls at risk for PCOS have low birth weight, and prospective studies <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> an increased prevalence of small-for-gestational-age offspring in women with PCOS...|$|R
50|$|Two studies <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> that {{rivastigmine}} {{may help}} with cognitive aspects, but {{the authors of}} both studies <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> a larger sampling be used. There {{is some evidence that}} the hypnotic zolpidem may improve motor function and eye movements, but only from small-scale studies.|$|R
5|$|In 1905 the Heroic Self Sacrifice Memorial Committee <b>had</b> <b>suggested</b> to Mary Watts {{that public}} funds be raised to {{complete}} the memorial, but she objected and promised {{to complete the}} 120 tablets at her own cost or provide funds in her will to do so. However, in 1910 she told the Committee that {{she was unable to}} fund the project, as she was devoting her time and money to the Watts Mortuary Chapel and the Watts Gallery in Compton. Work to fill the three empty rows of the memorial was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, Stephen Hawking {{published}} a calculation which suggested that black holes {{are not completely}} black but emit a dim radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon. This work extended previous results of Jacob Bekenstein who <b>had</b> <b>suggested</b> that black holes have a well defined entropy. At first, Hawking's result appeared to contradict {{one of the main}} postulates of quantum mechanics, namely the unitarity of time evolution. Intuitively, the unitarity postulate says that quantum mechanical systems do not destroy information as they evolve from one state to another. For this reason, the apparent contradiction {{came to be known as}} the black hole information paradox.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, {{there was}} {{discussion}} about a future westward extension to I-68. Such an extension would connect the western terminus of I-68 in Morgantown to WV2 in Moundsville. A 1989 proposal <b>had</b> <b>suggested</b> a toll road be built along this corridor. In 2003, the Federal Highway Administration approved the extension, {{paving the way}} for federal funding and for the road {{to become part of the}} National Highway System on completion. However, the project ran into problems due to lack of funds, and in 2008, West Virginia Governor Joe Manchin suggested dropping the project altogether, making construction of a westward extension of I-68 unlikely in the near future.|$|E

50|$|Christian Settipani <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> the Martiniakos {{family could}} share common ancestry with the Phrygian Dynasty, {{allowing}} descendants some {{claim to the}} throne. He <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> the relation may be {{through one of the}} sisters of dynasty founder Michael II. The origins of the dynasty are poorly recorded.|$|R
50|$|On a {{more limited}} basis, BRTA <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> that a park and ride railway station be {{provided}} at Brackmills. In the light of local population growth, BRTA <b>has</b> <b>suggested</b> that a reopened line, including a station at Olney, would relieve the A428 road and promote tourism.|$|R
5|$|Isaac Newton had {{considered}} the {{effect in the}} Principia, but pessimistically thought that any real mountain would produce too small a deflection to measure. Gravitational effects, he wrote, were only discernible on the planetary scale. Newton's pessimism was unfounded: although his calculations <b>had</b> <b>suggested</b> a deviation of less than 2minutes of arc (for an idealised three-mile high mountain), this angle, though very slight, was within the theoretical capability of instruments of his day.|$|E
5|$|King was {{influential}} in deciding who would play Flagg {{in the television}} adaptation of The Stand. He felt {{he was the best}} villain he had ever created, and wanted the actor playing him to be right for the part. Director Mick Garris and the studios wanted to give the role to an established star such as Christopher Walken, James Woods, Willem Dafoe or Jeff Goldblum. King himself <b>had</b> <b>suggested</b> Robert Duvall in his introduction to the novel. Miguel Ferrer, who played Flagg's henchman in the film, was interested in playing the villain.|$|E
5|$|On 24 August 1899, Sub-Inspector AM Harte-Barry of the British South Africa Police interviewed Chief Mubruma, who corroborated {{much of what}} Chintanda {{had said}} {{regarding}} Clark's claims to represent the Company. Mubruma said that Clark had visited the previous week and {{had told him to}} have his men ready for work south of the river within a month. When told that Clark had no connection with the BSAC, Mubruma said that he would not give Clark the workers, but would readily take part in the kind of scheme he <b>had</b> <b>suggested</b> if the Company wished. He made no comment relevant to Clark's alleged sexual misconduct.|$|E
50|$|There {{is little}} {{information}} on the breeding of the Megalurus warblers. Some studies <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> polygamy, while others <b>have</b> <b>suggested</b> monogamy {{is the most important}} breeding system. The nest is an open or partially open cup suspended in reeds. The clutch size is two to six eggs.|$|R

5|$|On November 18, 2011, Hareide was {{appointed}} to lead the parliamentary committee that is investigating the 2011 Norway Attacks. His nomination to that position was proposed by the red-green parties. On January 23, 2012, Hareide denounced a speech at KrF's local chapter in Sarpsborg that <b>had</b> <b>suggested</b> that the terrorist attacks and the Alexander Kielland disaster were divine warnings or punishments for Norway's policy towards Israel; Hareide {{said that this was}} far beyond normal thinking and completely out of line with the party's values.|$|E
5|$|Politically, the Belgians did {{not trust}} the French. Marshal Philippe Pétain <b>had</b> <b>suggested</b> a French strike at Germany's Ruhr area using Belgium as a spring-board in October 1930 and again in January 1933. Belgium feared it would be drawn into a war regardless, and sought to avoid that eventuality. The Belgians also feared being drawn into a war {{as a result of}} the French–Soviet pact of May 1935. The Franco-Belgian {{agreement}} stipulated Belgium was to mobilise if the Germans did, but what was not clear was whether Belgium would have to mobilise in the event of a German invasion of Poland.|$|E
5|$|Roosevelt, both appreciating Willkie's talents, {{and seeking}} to {{divide and conquer}} his opposition, had been mulling over ways his former {{opponent}} might be of use. The president's onetime advisor, Justice Felix Frankfurter, <b>had</b> <b>suggested</b> to Van Doren on New Year's Eve that Willkie should travel across the Atlantic to demonstrate bipartisan support of Britain. Willkie had already been planning a visit in support for Britain. Roosevelt believed that the visit of the nominal head of the opposition party {{would be far more}} effective in demonstrating American support than sending one of his advisors.|$|E
