5|$|There {{are many}} ways in which viruses spread from host to host but each species of virus uses only one or two. Many viruses that infect plants are carried by organisms; such organisms are called vectors. Some viruses that infect animals, {{including}} humans, are also spread by vectors, usually blood-sucking insects. However, direct transmission is more common. Some virus infections, such as norovirus and rotavirus, are spread by contaminated food and water, hands and communal objects and by intimate contact with another infected person, while others are airborne (influenza virus). Viruses such as HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C are often transmitted by unprotected sex or contaminated hypodermic needles. It <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how each different kind of virus is spread to prevent infections and epidemics.|$|E
5|$|Apollo Justice was {{developed}} {{by a team of}} 28 staff members. It was produced by Minae Matsukawa and directed by Mitsuru Endo, with character design and art by Kazuya Nuri, while series creator Shu Takumi wrote the game's scenario and took on a supervisory role. Takumi had wanted the series to end with the previous game, as he felt its main character, Phoenix Wright, had been fully explored and that his story had been told; he said that it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> when to end a story, {{that he did not want}} the series to become a shadow of its former self, and that he did not see any reason to continue it. When it was still decided that a fourth game would be made, Takumi wanted it to have a new main character and a new story; he did not plan to have Phoenix appear in the game, but his colleagues wanted him in the game in some form, which led to him being the accused in the first case in the game.|$|E
5|$|For {{the fourth}} game, Takumi wrote the {{scenario}} and {{took on a}} supervisory role. He had wanted the series to end with the third game, as he felt Phoenix had been fully explored and that his story had been told; {{he said that it}} <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> when to end a story, {{that he did not want}} the series to become a shadow of its former self, and that he did not see any reason to continue it. Despite this, the spin-off series Ace Attorney Investigations was created, being directed by Takeshi Yamazaki and produced by Motohide Eshiro; Takumi returned to the series to write the crossover Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney. He also directed and wrote Dai Gyakuten Saiban, which was described as being the first entry in a new Ace Attorney series. He said that he has mixed feelings about the series being developed by other Capcom staff, comparing it to a parent sending their child to their first day in school. Yamazaki and Eshiro went on to direct and produce the main series entries Dual Destinies and Spirit of Justice. Due to exhaustion after working on Dual Destinies, Yamazaki split direction responsibilities with Takuro Fuse for Spirit of Justice, with Yamazaki working on the scenario, and Fuse on the art and gameplay.|$|E

30|$|However, the low {{variability}} {{we observed}} in performance does not exclude {{the possibility of}} a relationship between the duration of eye fixation and the establishment of controlling by selection or rejection. For example, in terms of duration of eye fixation, it would <b>be</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> whether other participants exhibiting a different pattern than that {{of the participants in the}} present experiment would achieve a high percentage of correct responses in probes evaluating select and reject control relationships. In a similar way, it would <b>be</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> whether participants who performed poorly on tests would exhibit a pattern of eye fixation different from that of the present experiment. These questions require future studies in which experimental manipulations generate differential patterns of select and reject controlling relationships (for example, as suggested by Johnson and Sidman 1993) in order to assess whether such variability is related to patterns of eye fixation.|$|R

25|$|Solutes {{in water}} also affect water {{activity}} that affects many chemical reactions {{and the growth}} of microbes in food. Water activity can be described as a ratio of the vapor pressure of water in a solution to the vapor pressure of pure water. Solutes in water lower water activity—this <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> because most bacterial growth ceases at low levels of water activity. Not only does microbial growth affect the safety of food, but also the preservation and shelf life of food.|$|E
25|$|To draw an {{algebraic}} curve, it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> {{the remarkable}} points and their tangents, the infinite branches and their asymptotes (if any) {{and the way}} in which the arcs connect them. It is also useful to consider the inflection points as remarkable points. When all this information is drawn on a sheet of paper, the shape of the curve usually appears rather clearly. If not, it suffices to add a few other points and their tangents to get a good description of the curve.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} {{micelles}} {{was introduced to}} describe the core-corona aggregates of small surfactant molecules, however it has also extended to describe aggregates of amphiphilic block copolymers in selective solvents. It <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> {{the difference between these}} two systems. The major difference between these two types of aggregates is in the size of their building blocks. Surfactant molecules have a molecular weight which is generally of a few hundreds of grams per mole while block copolymers are generally one or two orders of magnitude larger. Moreover, thanks to the larger hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts, block copolymers can have a much more pronounced amphiphilic nature when compared to surfactant molecules.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{interesting}} to note that different scholars frequently have different opinions regarding any given question. This is why there is usually more than one fatwa regarding any one question. In fact, {{there are a number of}} methodologies for how to understand evidence gathered from the previously mentioned sources of Islamic law. Scholars who follow different methodologies will frequently arrive at different answers to the same question. It is well known that in Islam there are four schools of thought, and each of them differ with respect to certain aspects. However, it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that these differences are usually about minor issues. For example, in terms of beliefs, the vast majority of Muslims agree on most aspects of belief, most importantly the concept of monotheism, and belief in the angels, Prophets, holy books and the Day of Judgment.|$|E
25|$|In limited over matches (one innings matches), {{the team}} that scores more runs wins. So if team A scored 250 from 50 overs {{with the loss of}} 1 wicket (250–1), then the target for team B is to get 251. The number of wickets that has fallen does not affect which team has won. So if team B scored 251 but with the loss of 9 wickets (251–9), team B still won because it scored more runs, even though it lost more wickets. In a similar {{situation}} if team A scored 250/1, but team B scored 240 (all out), then team A would win because it scored more runs. Part way through a limited over match, to judge the likely final scores, it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> in addition to runs already scored and wickets already lost, how many overs each side has remaining, so this is always quoted.|$|E

25|$|Stability of {{nanoparticle}} agglomerates {{is critical}} for estimating size distribution of aerosolized particles from nano-powders or other sources. At nanotechnology workplaces, workers can be exposed via inhalation to potentially toxic substances during handling and processing of nanomaterials. Nanoparticles in the air often form agglomerates due to attractive inter-particle forces, such as van der Waals force or electrostatic force if the particles are charged. As a result, aerosol particles are usually observed as agglomerates rather than individual particles. For exposure and risk assessments of airborne nanoparticles, it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> about the size distribution of aerosols. When inhaled by humans, particles with different diameters are deposited in varied locations of the central and periphery respiratory system. Particles in nanoscale {{have been shown to}} penetrate the air-blood barrier in lungs and be translocated into secondary organs in the human body, such as the brain, heart and liver. Therefore, the knowledge on stability of nanoparticle agglomerates is important for predicting the size of aerosol particles, which helps assess the potential risk of them to human bodies.|$|E

After development of the original Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney was finished, Takumi's boss, Shinji Mikami, told him that they should make an Ace Attorney trilogy, with a grand finale in the third game's last case. As Takumi wanted the three first Ace Attorney games to be parts of a larger work, he avoided making a lot of changes: art for main characters such as Phoenix, Maya and Edgeworth was reused from the first game, to avoid having the previous games look outdated in comparison to newer games in the series; and no new gameplay mechanics were added for Trials and Tribulations, as Takumi was happy with the gameplay after having added the psyche-lock mechanic for Justice for All. He wanted the series to end with Trials and Tribulations, as he had explored Phoenix's character fully and wanted to avoid the series becoming [...] "a shadow of its former self", saying that he thinks it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> when to end a story.|$|E

30|$|Finally, it will <b>be</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the {{distribution}} of subsidy payments across firms. Several {{studies have found that}} participation in employer subsidies is highest among large firms, and that many small firms are unaware of the subsidy.

To the extent that data on firm size, location, and industry are not already available from government records, it is relatively easy to collect it from firms claiming the subsidy. In sum, for management purposes, a subsidy program needs not only a system for generating descriptive statistics from data flowing in from eligibility determinations and subsidy payments, but should also collect ancillary data from sample surveys of workers and firms, to answer questions that go beyond simple descriptions of subsidies paid and their recipients.|$|R
