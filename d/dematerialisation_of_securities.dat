Until this point, many exchanges would act as their own clearing house, however the additional computer systems required to handle large volumes of trades, {{and the opening of}} new financial markets in the 1980s, such as the 1986 big bang in the UK, led to a number of exchanges separating or contracting the clearing and settlement functions to dedicated organisations.|$|E

Today, only the United States and the United Kingdom, due to more ancient and more extended infrastructures, maintain a substantial minority of securities under a paper form. The <b>dematerialisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> incurs that most securities, even though they are sometimes characterised as [...] "bearer securities", do not take any more the form of paper forms held at home by the investor or deposited in a vault with a bank.

These programmes take {{a variety of forms}} and often exist to satisfy a number of objectives. In some jurisdictions, they play a significant funding role. Even in countries where retail borrowing programmes play a small role, they are in many cases politically important because they satisfy primarily social objectives. In recent years, some OECD countries have begun to reconsider their retail borrowing programmes. Shrinking borrowing requirements in a number of countries have led to priority being put on maintaining liquid wholesale markets. Other countries continue to see benefits from their retail borrowing programmes and use them as a significant and stable source of funding.

40|$|A <b>dematerialisation</b> <b>of</b> {{the economy}} {{can provide a}} crucial {{contribution}} toward sustainable devel-opment. It can {{take place in the}} production sphere through technological change or in the con-sumption sphere through altered consumer behaviour. This paper focuses on the second case, a shift of expenditure from material consumption (e. g. manufactured products) to non-material consumption (e. g. services). Since all production requires material, an input-output model is used to account for indirect material use. The model features post-Keynesian macroeconomic founda-tions, which make it possible to study the effects of altered consumption patterns on total con-sumption, output, and income distribution. The empirical application for the case of Germany shows that a <b>dematerialisation</b> <b>of</b> consumption might be considered a win-win strategy from an ecological and economic viewpoint. However, its effects on the distribution of income and inter-national trade may be problematic. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{communication}} {{sets out}} some methodological and technical operations that the Ponte de Lima county is taking over {{during the process}} <b>of</b> <b>dematerialisation</b> <b>of</b> their analogical information processes, that compose the current Municipal Active and Permanent Information System. Within {{the scope of the}} information society and taking into consideration the central role of information as a dynamic motor for the municipality in providing products and information services to its citizens, it is necessary a new approach in the production, management, organization, representation, circulation and retrieval of information, by adopting the technologies needed for the transformation it creates. Thus, the Municipal Information System Active and Permanent positions itself on a dynamic organic-functional context, which can be studied and processed based on a systematic point of view, in light of the new paradigm - post-custodial, informational and scientific – of information science. The Arquivo Municipal of Ponte de Lima intends to assert itself as an important element in the implementation of administrative modernisation, both by means of studying the user’s informational behaviour and optimising informational flows, improving thus the rendering of multi-channel services (digital and analogical), both for internal users (municipal services) and for external users (residents). The methodology described in this communication focuses on presenting a case study, developed under the project "e-archives" subject to the application Sama funded by NSRF, which includes the <b>dematerialisation</b> <b>of</b> Private Works Procedures. The <b>dematerialisation</b> <b>of</b> these processes requires the identification of document types, of the type of processes and information flows, with a view to simplify and streamline existing procedures and adjust informational flows, arising from the informational behaviour of the several parts involved.

50|$|Berríos-Negrón's social {{pedestals}} take environmental form {{as their}} medium. In {{parallel to the}} works of contemporary artists such as Mark Leckey that take the <b>dematerialisation</b> <b>of</b> sculpture {{as part of the}} digitalisation of life, in the case of Berríos-Negrón’s work, his temporary works often contend with <b>dematerialisation</b> as part <b>of</b> the geopolitics of climate change or forced migration. These time-based works are conditioned by things that at first glance could be dispassionately thought of as ordinary things, such as ropes, tables, chairs, carpets, book shelves, archives, and so forth. Berríos-Negrón believes that these things only begin to work as social pedestals when activated by collective engagement. As part of his own culture and education, Berríos-Negrón points to Brazilian and Latin American Neo-concrete art and to “transculturation”, as well as to North American Interrogative Design and Second-Order Cybernetics.|$|R

50|$|Berríos-Negrón {{defines a}} social {{pedestal}} {{as an art}} form that looks to make visible the <b>dematerialisation</b> <b>of</b> sculpture. He does not see it as a singular, physical thing, but a time-based form of displaying art that is characterised by multiple types of visible and invisible sculptural objects and experiences. Berríos-Negrón argues that the social pedestal does evolve from the “Social sculpture” in that it also looks to contribute to the understanding of art's potential to shape, structure and transform society and the environment. In that regard, Berríos-Negrón intends his social pedestals to go beyond the body and agency of the artist, aspiring to condition the transformative potential of art by making environments that operate by themselves, without the direct intentionality of the artist. As such, Berríos-Negrón deploys these environments with the intention of facilitating a social experience that is often contemplative and participatory, one that displays affirmative intersections between artistic, curatorial, political, and scientific practices.|$|R
