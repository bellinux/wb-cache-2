5|$|Academic {{journals}} and conferences, however, <b>have</b> <b>continued</b> <b>to</b> {{comment on the}} theme of race within the game.

Writing for the Digital Games Research Association in 2011, Geyser and Tshabalala noted that racial stereotyping had never been in intention of Capcom, though compared their depiction of Africa to that of the 1899 novel Heart of Darkness. Post-colonial Africa, they opined, was portrayed as being unable to take care of itself, and at the mercy of Western influences.|$|E
