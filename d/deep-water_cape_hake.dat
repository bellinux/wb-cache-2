40|$|ABSTRACT Spawning {{times and}} {{spawning}} intensity {{during the life}} cycles of some fish species found off South Africa and Norway were synthesized using data collected from the literature. The comparison of temporal patterns in spawning of South African fish species showed variable spawning times and intensity depending on the environmental conditions within that spawning habitat. Their spawning migration durations were suggested to be short since they inhabit a dynamic coastal upwelling ecosystem with intra-seasonal differences caused by changes in upwelling strength enhanced by south-easterly winds, nutrient-limited waters on the spawning grounds and stable thermal conditions. This contrasts with Norwegian fish species, which showed patterns of spawning times and durations that are restricted and confined to spring (February – May), probably due to strong, consistent seasonality, depending on primary production. This explains the inter-annual differences observed in their spawning periods, where strong south-westerly winds (downwelling), light intensity and salinity stratification could influence long spawning migrations. For Cape hakes, environmental variability influencing recruitment was further investigated {{on the west coast}} nursery grounds of the southern Benguela, particularly for <b>deep-water</b> <b>Cape</b> <b>hake</b> (Merluccius paradoxus). Biophysical characteristics of the west coast nursery grounds were assessed in relation to distribution of <b>deep-water</b> <b>Cape</b> <b>hake</b> juveniles (< 15 cm) using physical data (CTD, alongshore wind speed anomalies) and biological data (abundance/density of hake juveniles, recruitment estimates). Distinct spatial patterns of hake distribution were evident in relation to near-bottom environmental factors (temperature, salinity and oxygen). Nansen surveys conducted from 2003 – 2013 during summer (January – February) showed greater abundance of hake juveniles over the Orange Banks than in other nursery areas. The hake juveniles occurred in mid-shelf waters with oxygen depletion (2 – 3 mL O₂. L⁻¹) and hypoxic conditions (< 2 mL O₂. L⁻¹) and temperature ranges of 7 – 11 ⁰C. Salinity appeared to have less influence on hake juveniles' distribution. During spring surveys, hake catches were reduced on all nursery grounds except near Cape Columbine. There was a strong positive correlation between <b>deep-water</b> <b>Cape</b> <b>hake</b> recruitment indices and summer wind speed anomalies for the same year (Lag = 0 year) and with autumn wind speed anomalies of the previous year (Lag = 1 year). The relationship between winds and near-bottom oxygen concentrations on the Orange Banks is unclear and needs to be investigated...|$|E
40|$|The commercially {{valuable}} hake fishery off South Africa {{consists of}} two morphologically similar species, the shallow-water Cape hake Merluccius capensis and the <b>deep-water</b> <b>Cape</b> <b>hake</b> M. paradoxus. Because catch-and effort statistics collected from the fishery are not species-disaggregated, previous published quantitative assessment methods have treated the two hake species as one. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that (although treated as two separate populations in past assessments) the South and West coasts components of each species form a single stock. This paper describes {{the development of the}} first fully species-disaggregated coast-wide baseline assessment of the South African hake resource.

Baselines were calculated using the empirical percentiles (EmP) method applied to length (L) – weight (W) data collected by research surveys on the South African west and south coasts, from 1983 to 2013. Four quadratic Ws equations for each species were generated, based on the following weight statistics for each size class j : first quartile, median, third quartile and mean. Median Ws equations were chosen for the baseline for shallow-water hake (log&# 8321;&# 8320; Ws=- 2. 491 + 3. 33 8 *(log&# 8321;&# 8320; L) - 0. 065 *(log&# 8321;&# 8320; Lj) ²) and deep-water hake (log&# 8321;&# 8320; Ws =- 2. 161 + 2. 930 *(log&# 8321;&# 8320; L) + 0. 0456 *(log 10 Lj) ²).

Monthly mean Wr indices peaked in June and October for shallow-water hake and July and October for deep-water hake. Mean Wr values were different for shallow-water hake on the south (105 %) and west (103 %) coasts. Deep-water hake showed no spatial variability in mean Wr values.

40|$|The hake {{fishery is}} South Africa's most {{valuable}} and harvests two morphologically similar species, the shallow- water Cape hake Merluccius capensis and the <b>deep-water</b> <b>Cape</b> <b>hake</b> M. paradoxus. Since 1948, annual catches have exceeded 50 000 tons {{and the current}} total allowable catch (TAC) is about 150 000 tons, a quantity informed by assessments of the hake resource. Current assessments on which management is based use single-stock models that ignore food-web effects. Usually including such interactions in assessments is problematic because {{of the complexity of}} food webs. In the case of Cape hake, however, cannibalism and inter-species predation form a very large component of hake mortality and food consumption, thus making a multi-species model not only more feasible but also likely more reliable. A comprehensive multi-species model incorporating these interactions was last investigated in 1995. Since then, substantially more data have become available, and hake single-species assessments have developed considerably, inter alia now including the ability to take careful account of species differentiation. Additionally, with increased computer processing power, more sophisticated modelling can now be attempted than was possible 20 years ago, rendering an update and refinement of the 1995 analyses timeous. The thesis uses mathematical methods to model hake-on-hake predation and cannibalism in hake populations explicitly by incorporating an additional mortality term to account for these interactions. Information from stomach samples obtained on hake research surveys on predator and prey lengths, {{as well as on the}} proportion of hake in the diet of hake predators, is then included when fitting the model to data. Chapter 1 contains a brief introduction to the work. Chapter 2 provides background information on the Cape hake fishery and its management, as well as pertinent information on the biology and diet of the hake (and related fish) from the literature that is relevant to the development of the model constructed in this thesis. Chapter 3 lays out the data available for assessing the Cape hake populations: abundance indices together with catch and catch-at-size data for the standard non-predation model, and hake stomach content data for the years 1999 - 2013 to inform the predation component of multi-species model developed. Chapter 4 provides the details for the standard hake assessment model used at present to inform management of the stocks. This model forms the basis for the multi-species model developed incorporating predation, which is presented in Chapter 5.

The {{two species}} of <b>Cape</b> <b>hake,</b> Merluccius capensis (shallow-water hake) and M paradoxus (deepwater hake), fomi the {{mainstay}} of the bottom trawl industry off South Africa and constitute the country's most valuable fishery. It is therefore important that the status of this resource be assessed regularly to ensure that exploitation is at a sustainable level. The two <b>Cape</b> <b>hake</b> species are morphologically similar and no distinction is made between them in commercial catch statistics. Consequently, for assessment purposes, the <b>Cape</b> <b>hakes</b> are treated as a single species. It is assumed that two stocks of <b>Cape</b> <b>hake</b> exist, one off the West Coast and another off the South Coast of South Africa. Central to the assessments of these stocks are the catch per unit effort (CPUE) data because it assumed that CPUE is proportional to abundance. The nominal CPUE (hake catch divided by actual time trawled) for both the West and South Coast stocks has shown a steady growth over the period 1978 - 1994, increasing {{at a rate of}} 3. 8 % per annum on the West Coast and 4. 2 % per annum on the South Coast. The bulk of this thesis is concerned with determining whether these increases in CPUE are the result of an increasing biomass, or are rather, in part, the result of improved vessel efficiency due to technological advancement or of changes in fishing strategy. The existing CPUE time series had previously been standardised by means of applying power factors which were crudely estimated in the early 1970 s and which are likely inappropriate for the current fishing fleets. These CPUE series have therefore been re-standardised by applying the internationally accepted approach of General Linear Modelling (GLM) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{offshore}} demersal hake trawl is {{the largest}} sector of the South African hake fishery, which targets shallow-water (Merluccius capensis) and <b>deep-water</b> (M. paradoxus) <b>Cape</b> <b>hakes.</b> Economically, {{it is the most}} important fishery in South Africa, generating ZAR ~ 5 billion in revenue, mainly from exports, and it supports an estimated 30 000 jobs. Whereas {{there are a number of}} single-species and ecosystem models that assess hake stock dynamics and examine the food web dynamics of the southern Benguela ecosystem, the human social hake fishery system is less understood. In order to address this need, this study's aims are to i) analyse the structure and dynamics of the economics of the South African offshore demersal hake trawl fishery from empirical data and stakeholder interviews, and ii) produce a prototype economic simulation model of this fishery to better understand the dynamics of the industry and the relative importance of its internal and external drivers, e. g. industrial organization, environmental uncertainty, exchange rate and fuel price. The empirical analyses confirm that the offshore hake trawl fishery is an economically mature and highly vertically integrated industry. That is, most companies control much of the value-chain, catching, processing, marketing and distributing their fish products, with access to economies of scope and scale. Nine company clusters, formed through consolidation of fishing rights and a variety of catch-share agreements, have been identified. Based on their size and operations they have been categorized as small, medium, large and super-cluster types. Fishing vessel numbers have declined since 1978 to streamline operations, with current effort optimising restrictions based on vessel engine power and the ability to catch the full quota. During the observation period (2005 - 2012), high-value export markets have bought 60 - 70 % of the South African hake total allowable catch (TAC), comprising nine major markets and a number of smaller ones. The lower-value domestic market takes ca. 30 % plus imports equivalent to another ca. 15 % of TAC. Hake export volumes have shifted from fresh to frozen and increasingly to value-added products, especially after the 2008 banking crisis. This corresponds to an industry-confirmed price-convergence between fresh and frozen hake products. This product displacement trend is largely due to changes in the largest export market, Spain, and is mirrored by an increased reliance on freezer trawling in the industry...|$|R

Species which may prove important {{as a result of}} further research are Lolliguncula mercatoris, Ommastrephes bartramii, Todarodes filippovae, Histioteuthis miranda and Abraliopsis gilchristi.

Use of the latter criterion indicates that Sepia australis, Todaropsis eblanae and Lycoteuthis ?diadema are sufficiently abundant to be exploited by fisheries.

40|$|The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} variability of the egg and larval abundance of Merluccius spp. in the Benguela Jet Current was analysed. The <b>Cape</b> <b>hakes,</b> occurring in waters off South Africa, are important for the commercial fisheries in the southern Benguela system, but information on their early life-history strategy is sparse. Data and samples, for this study, were collected during bimonthly cruises of the South African Sardine and Anchovy Recruitment Project (SARP) from August 1995 to July 2003. Samples were collected with a mini-bongo net (300  µm mesh) on a transect crossing the Benguela Current off the Cape Peninsula at 34. 15 °S, 18. 29 °E extending 58  nm offshore. Eggs and larvae were commonly found in currents with north-westerly flow, suggesting that the Benguela Jet Current transports eggs and larvae of Merluccius spp. to the northern nursery areas. Spawning grounds of Merluccius spp. appeared {{to be on the}} western Agulhas Bank during August 1996 to July 1998. Two possible spawning grounds in different water depths were identified, suggesting spawning by both <b>Cape</b> <b>hake</b> species, M. capensis and M. paradoxus. Peak abundances of eggs and larvae of Merluccius spp. were found from June to October, a time of reduced offshore transport. Abundances of eggs and larvae were low in austral summer and autumn.

40|$|The {{demersal}} fishery off {{the west}} coast of South Africa experiences decreased catches per unit effort of hake, Merluccius capensis and M. paradoxus, following the onset of strong south easterly winds. Research has demonstrated that, during daylight hours, <b>Cape</b> <b>hakes</b> migrate vertically in the water column in response to strong south easterly winds, decreasing their availability to the bottom trawl. Hydroacoustic, trawl and environmental data were collected off the West Coast during both calm and wind-swept periods in an attempt to understand the forces that initiate this behaviour, its spatial variability and the implications for demersal trawl estimates of abundance. Near-bottom currents appear to be the primary factor influencing the vertical distribution of the demersal fish community, of which hake constitutes a large proportion, during daylight hours. Correlation between wind and near-bottom currents suggest that the poleward component of the currents increase in velocity within eight hours following the onset of south easterly winds. The fish avoid boundary layers where currents change direction and speed dramatically, and seem to concentrate in waters with relatively stable current regimes. This result questions the assumption of CPUE-based assessment models that hake availability to the bottom trawl is constant or varies randomly. The incorporation of acoustic assessment techniques to demersal surveys has potential, but may be most valuable by supplementing swept-area estimates of abundance, since the sampling efficiency of these methods varies within the water column. The incorporation of wind indices and gear performance data to <b>Cape</b> <b>hake</b> assessment models have been identified as useful considerations for the future. _______________________________________________________...|$|R

40|$|Sewage {{effluents}} disposed {{into the}} marine environment from De Beers Marine Namibia diamond mining vessels {{have the potential to}} cause endocrine disruptive effects in marine organisms. Endocrine disruption refers to the alteration of the normal functioning of the endocrine system and various chemicals have the ability to mimic hormones, effecting endogenous hormone synthesis, transport, receptor interaction and intracellular signaling. The potential endocrine disruptive effects, caused by the release of different types of sewage effluents into the ocean, on fish species is a concern due to the commercial importance of fish species found in the mining area e. g. hake, sole, horse mackerel. Increased awareness of marine environmental degradation due to the presence of chemical contaminants has resulted in research being done on early warning systems, in the form of biomarkers. Cytochrome P 450 monooxygenase 1 A (CYP 1 A) and vitellogenin (vtg) are important proteins found in fish liver and blood, that have been used as biomarkers for the detection of pollutants in fish. CYP 1 A is a subfamily of the P 450 superfamily of enzymes and catalyzes the oxidation, hydrolysis and reduction of exogenous and endogenous compounds (phase I reactions) and thus has the capacity to regulate the metabolism of several organic contaminants. CYP 1 A expression is altered by exposure to planar xenobiotic compounds e. g. polyaromatic hydrocarbons. Vtg is an important precursor for egg yolk proteins and plays a role in the growth and development of an oocyte. Expression of this protein is altered upon exposure to estrogenic compounds. The aim of this project was to isolate CYP 1 A from fish liver by differential centrifugation and optimize conditions for the CYP 1 A-mediated ethoxyresorufin-Odeethylase (EROD) assay and western blot analysis (to assess CYP 1 A expression). Another aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the potential effects of biologically disruptive chemicals from sewage effluents, discharged into {{the marine environment}}, on the expression of CYP 1 A in two species of hake, Merluccius capensis and M. paradoxus (<b>Cape</b> <b>hake).</b> CYP 1 A in <b>Cape</b> <b>hake</b> is approximately a 60 kDa protein and the highest EROD activity was detected in the microsomal fraction after differential centrifugation. Optimal EROD assay conditions were observed at pH 7. 5, a temperature of 25 °C, 10 μl of sample and a reaction time of 30 seconds. Enzyme stability assays indicated a drastic decrease in enzyme activity after 30 seconds. The EROD assay was not NADPH dependent but was limited by NADPH supply, with an increase of 300 % in EROD activity being observed with the addition of 0. 1 M exogenous NADPH. The addition of dicumarol (40 μM), a phase II enzyme inhibitor, showed a 232 % increase in EROD activity. This is because dicumarol inhibited enzymes with the capacity to metabolize the product (resorufin) of the EROD reaction. With regard to western blot analysis, the optimal primary (rabbit antifish CYP 1 A peptide) and secondary (anti-mouse/rabbit antibody-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (POD)) antibody dilutions were determined to be 1 : 1000 and 1 : 5000, respectively. The comparison of CYP 1 A expression in <b>Cape</b> <b>hake</b> samples from De Beers Marine mining area and reference sites showed higher EROD activity (16. 29 ± 0. 91 pmol/min) in fish samples from the mining area in comparison to the reference site (10. 42 ± 2. 65 pmol/min). Western blot analysis was in agreement with the EROD assay results and a higher CYP 1 A expression was observed in fish from the mining sites. The increased CYP 1 A expression observed in fish from the mining area is not definitively an indication of a pollutant effect in the environment, as several environmental and biological factors (e. g. photoperiod and age) must also be considered before reaching this conclusion. Another aim of this study was to purify vtg from <b>Cape</b> <b>hake</b> blood samples. <b>Cape</b> <b>hake</b> vtg was purified from fish plasma by selective precipitation with MgCl 2 and EDTA. Precipitated sample was subjected to anion exchange chromatography using fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC). Vtg eluted as two broad peaks and had a molecular weight above 200 kDa. SDS-PAGE analysis also resolved smaller molecular weight proteins below 70 kDa, which were thought to be vitellogenin cleavage proteins, lipovitellin and phosphovitins. Western blot analysis was performed; however, it did not produce any conclusive results. The purification of vtg enables further studies in characterizing this protein and developing assay aimed at detecting estrogenic pollutants in the marine environmen...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparison}} {{was made}} of some biological characteristics and abundance dynamics of silver hake (Merluccius bilinearis) from Scotian Shelf (Northwest Atlantic) and <b>cape</b> <b>hake</b> (Merluccius capensis) from Southeast Atlantic area (between 18 °– 28 °S). Differences in size composition, growth rate and length-at-maturity were most significant in late- 1960 s – first half of 1970 s. During the subsequent period these parameters became more similar. Taking into consideration the approximately similar rates of natural mortality, these species may be described as belonging to similar abundance dynamics with high reproduction ability and strong fluctuation of abundance. During the period 1968 – 90 similarity of recruitment trends and total biomass of southern and northern species was found, along with evidence of a synchronous pattern of general trends under the impact of global climatic variations...|$|R
40|$|An {{instrumental}} {{method to}} predict frozen storage time of <b>Cape</b> <b>hake</b> {{was developed by}} evaluation {{of a combination of}} methods previously known to classify hake into different quality categories, such as apparent viscosity, Kramer and puncture tests. The results showed that with multiple linear regression analysis it was possible to obtain linear models for the prediction of storage time at - 20 °C. Only apparent viscosity (ηapp) and Kramer shear resistance (Kramer) were included in the regression model (months = 15. 003 - 0. 001 ηapp + 0. 144 Kramer; Radj 2 = 0. 91). The model had a typical error of estimation of 2. 0 months. The simplicity of the model, which requires only two parameters, and the easiness of their measurement make the method a good candidate for use in quality control laboratories of hake processing industries. © 2006 Society of Chemical Industry.

40|$|In summary, {{this work}} aims {{to build on}} that done by Punt and Leslie (1995) and Punt and Butterworth (1995) in the {{development}} of a multispecies model for the two <b>Cape</b> <b>hake</b> species, Merluccius capensis and M. paradoxus. There, the authors aimed to construct a model which included hake, seals and other predatory fish and then to use this model to assess the consequences of different levels of consumption of hake by seals on the hake fishery in the context of the change in the size of sustainable hake TACs and catch rates. They also aimed to investigate the effect of seal culling on the fishery. In the years that have passed since, more data have become available, and the hake assessment models have been continuously developed. The aim of the hake cannibalism and inter-species predation model presented in this document is to update the work done by Punt and Leslie (1995) with new data, and to extend the model to the level of the current hake assessment model...|$|R
40|$|Larval {{mortality}} in marine fish is strongly linked to characteristic traits such as growth and condition, but {{the variability in}} these traits is poorly understood. We tried to identify the variability in growth in relation to conditions leading to greater survival chances for early stages of <b>Cape</b> <b>hake,</b> Merluccius paradoxus and M. capensis, in the Benguela upwelling ecosystem. During two cruises in 2007 and one cruise in 2008, hake larvae and juveniles were caught. Otolith microstructures revealed a larval age ranging from 2 to 29 days post-hatching (dph), whereas juvenile age was 67 – 152 dph. RNA:DNA ratios, used to evaluate nutritional condition, were above the relevant threshold level for growth. No strong coupling between growth and condition was detected, indicating a complex relationship between these factors in the southern Benguela ecosystem. Merluccius paradoxus juveniles caught in 2007 (the surviving larvae of 2006) had significantly higher larval growth rates than larvae hatched in 2007 and 2008, possibly indicating selection for fast growth in 2006. High selection pressure on growth could be linked to predation avoidance, including cannibalism...|$|R
40|$|Dissertação mest., Gestão da Água e da Costa, Universidade do Algarve, 2007 Age {{and growth}} {{estimates}} of <b>Cape</b> <b>hake</b> (Merluccius capensis), {{in the waters}} off Namibia were described from 804 specimens collected during January and February 2003. Each specimen was aged twice using whole otoliths. Otolith growth measurements was taken and used in back-calculated length-at-age data of M. capensis. Direct average otolith growth measurements have shown that up to three false rings formed prior to the first annulus. Ogives demonstrated the differences in otolith diameter, location frequency between the annuli and false rings. A power fish length-otolith diameter relationship used for back-calculation is: (L = 1. 39 * OD). The average back-calculated lengths {{for the first four}} years of life were 19. 3, 25. 6, 31. 8 and 38. 2 cm total fish length. Age composition, estimated from an age length key, indicated that juveniles and young fish predominate in survey and commercial catches. The von Bertalanffy growth parameters was (growth coefficient, K = 0. 07; asymptotic length, = 123. 13; = - 1. 5). Sexual maturity was reached at age 1. 67 years. The high correlation between otolith weight and age permits the use of otolith weight as a substitute for future age assessments. 1717. 1 ∞L 0 t Ke...|$|R
