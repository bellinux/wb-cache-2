Conversely, the increasing popularity of drug treatment options {{and the expansion}} of benefits has motivated providers to overdiagnose ASD.

A number of Western cultures associate breasts with sexuality and tend to regard bare breasts in public as immodest or indecent. Breasts and especially the nipples are an erogenous zone on women.|$|E

25|$|Just under {{half the}} world's {{population}} {{is currently on}} the Internet. Roughly 75% {{of those people are}} on social media and ¾ of those folks <b>have</b> <b>social</b> media accounts on their mobile phones. Mobile phone usage is beneficial for social media marketing because mobile phones <b>have</b> <b>social</b> networking capabilities, allowing individuals immediate web browsing and access to social networking sites. Mobile phones have grown at a rapid rate, fundamentally altering the path-to-purchase process by allowing consumers to easily obtain pricing and product information in real time and allowing companies to constantly remind and update their followers. Many companies are now putting QR (Quick Response) codes along with products for individuals to access the company website or online services with their smart phones. Retailers use QR codes to facilitate consumer interaction with brands by linking the code to brand websites, promotions, product information, or any other mobile-enabled content. In addition, Real-time bidding use in the mobile advertising industry is high and rising because of its value for on-the-go web browsing. In 2012, Nexage, a provider of real time bidding in mobile advertising, reported a 37% increase in revenue each month. Adfonic, another mobile advertisement publishing platform, reported an increase of 22 billion ad requests that same year.|$|E
25|$|Incentive {{theory in}} {{psychology}} treats motivation {{and behavior of}} the individual as they are influenced by beliefs, such as engaging in activities {{that are expected to}} be profitable. Incentive theory is promoted by behavioral psychologists, such as B.F. Skinner. Incentive theory is especially supported by Skinner in his philosophy of Radical behaviorism, meaning that a person's actions always <b>have</b> <b>social</b> ramifications: and if actions are positively received {{people are more likely to}} act in this manner, or if negatively received people are less likely to act in this manner.|$|E
25|$|She also {{suggests}} video games can <b>have</b> <b>social</b> benefits for children, for example, video games {{can provide a}} topic of discussion and something over which children can bond, and can help children make friends; playing video games can increase a child's self-esteem when they are struggling in one aspect of their life, but {{are able to do}} something correctly in a video game; and, children can also learn to take on leadership roles within a multi-player online game. Christopher Ferguson, a psychologist well known for his video game research, conducted a study in which results suggest that violent games reduce depression and hostile feelings in players through mood management.|$|E

25|$|Folk {{models of}} belief, lack of education, and {{religious}} connotations {{of the disease}} continue to influence social perceptions of those afflicted {{in many parts of}} the world. In Brazil, for example, folklore holds that leprosy is transmitted by dogs, it is a disease associated with sexual promiscuity, and is sometimes thought to be punishment for sins or moral transgressions. Socioeconomic factors also have a direct impact. Lower-class domestic workers who are often employed by those in a higher socioeconomic class may find their employment in jeopardy as physical manifestations of the disease become apparent. Skin discoloration and darker pigmentation resulting from the disease also <b>have</b> <b>social</b> repercussions.|$|E

The only effect is {{on the ability to}} tell different notes apart due to the separation of two key areas in the brain. Most sufferers of amusia describe music as unpleasant. Others simply refer to it as noise and find it annoying. This can <b>have</b> <b>social</b> implications because amusics often try to avoid music, which in many social situations is not an option. In China and other countries in which identical words have different meanings based on pitch, amusia may have a much more pronounced social and emotional impact: difficulty in speaking and understanding the language.|$|E
25|$|Minority {{populations have}} {{increased}} exposure to environmental hazards that include lack of neighborhood resources, structural and community factors {{as well as}} residential segregation that result in a cycle of disease and stress. The environment that surrounds us can influence individual behaviors and lead to poor health choices and therefore outcomes. Minority neighborhoods have been continuously noted to have more fast food chains and fewer grocery stores than predominantly white neighborhoods. These food deserts affect a family’s ability to {{have easy access to}} nutritious food for their children. This lack of nutritious food extends beyond the household into the schools that have a variety of vending machines and deliver over processed foods. These environmental condition <b>have</b> <b>social</b> ramifications and in the first time in US history is it projected that the current generation will live shorter lives than their predecessors will.|$|E

25|$|Poverty {{cannot be}} defined only by {{statistics}} and reports, {{such as the}} poverty line, {{to see whether or}} not people are impoverished in their respective countries. The concept of social and cultural exclusion helps to better convey poverty as a process that involves multiple agents. Many developing countries <b>have</b> <b>social</b> and cultural norms that prevent women from having access to formal employment. Especially in parts of Asia, North Africa, and Latin America, the cultural and social norms do not allow women to have much labor productivity outside the home as well as an economic bargaining position within the household. This social inequality deprives women of capabilities, particularly employment, which leads to women having a higher risk of poverty. This increase in occupational gender segregation and widening of the gender wage gap increases women's susceptibility to poverty.|$|E
25|$|The gene NRG1 {{codes for}} neuregulin 1, a growth factor which {{is crucial to}} the {{development}} of the nervous system, and to neurotransmission and formation of synapses in adults. NRG1 and the gene for the receptor to which neuregulin 1 binds, ERBB4, have been tested as possible animal models of schizophrenia. While mice which have two copies of (are homozygous for) a knocked out version of NRG1 do not survive, viable animal models have been developed using heterozygous or partial knockout. One such mouse model is the heterozygous removal of the EGF-like domain on neuregulin 1, these models are called Nrg1(ΔEGF)+/− mice. Nrg1(ΔEGF)+/− mice have been shown to <b>have</b> <b>social</b> interaction problems, reduced prepulse of inhibition and larger spontaneous locomotion. Other neuregulin 1 models include the heterozygous removal of the transmembrane domain (Nrg1(ΔTM)+/− mice) and the immunoglobulin domain (Nrg1(ΔIg)+/− mice). Nrg1(ΔTM)+/− mice display hyperactivity in various conditions, an effect which is reduced by the atypical antipsychotic clozapine.|$|E

500|$|Social deficits {{distinguish}} {{autism and}} the related autism spectrum disorders (ASD; see Classification) from other developmental disorders. People with autism <b>have</b> <b>social</b> impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted.

The shooting was baffling to those who knew him, as he appeared outgoing and never appeared to <b>have</b> <b>social</b> problems. This has also confused investigators, who have not found a suicide note. Some of Kazmierczak's former NIU roommates described him as a quiet man who usually stayed to himself.

500|$|Thomas's {{refusal to}} align with any {{literary}} group or movement {{has made him}} and his work difficult to categorize. Although influenced by the modern symbolism and surrealism movement he refused to follow its creed. Instead Thomas is viewed {{as part of the}} modernism and romanticism movements, though attempts to pigeon-hole him within a particular neo-romantic school have been unsuccessful. Elder Olson, in his 1954 critical study of Thomas's poetry, wrote [...] "...a further characteristic which distinguished Thomas's work from that of other poets. It was unclassifiable." [...] Olson continued that in a postmodern age that continually attempted to demand that poetry <b>have</b> <b>social</b> reference, none could be found in Thomas's work, and that his work was so obscure that critics could not explicate it.|$|E
