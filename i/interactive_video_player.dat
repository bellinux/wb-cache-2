50|$|Project Tuva was a {{collaborative}} research project between Bill Gates and Microsoft Research in 2009 demonstrating the potential {{value of an}} <b>interactive</b> <b>video</b> <b>player</b> platform for learning. The platform hosted the Messenger Lectures series titled The Character of Physical Law given at Cornell University by Richard Feynman in 1964 and recorded by the BBC. According to his video introduction, Gates saw the lectures when he was younger. He enjoyed the physics concepts and Feynman's lecturing style, and later acquired the rights to make the video available to the public. He hopes that this will encourage others to make educational content available for free.|$|E

This paper describes a video processing framework that explores {{the use of}} these features for multimedia applications. Processes are used to encapsulate operations on video and audio streams; mobile data types are used to transfer data between them efficiently, and mobile channels allow the process network to be dynamically reconfigured at runtime. We present demonstration applications including an <b>interactive</b> <b>video</b> <b>player.</b> Preliminary benchmarks show that the framework has comparable overhead to multimedia systems programmed using traditional methods...|$|E
40|$|Millions of {{learners}} today use how-to videos to master new skills {{in a variety}} of domains. But browsing such videos is often tedious and inefficient because video player interfaces are not optimized for the unique step-by-step structure of such videos. This research aims to improve the learning experience of existing how-to videos with step-by-step annotations. We first performed a formative study to verify that annota tions are actually useful to learners. We created ToolScape, an <b>interactive</b> <b>video</b> <b>player</b> that displays step descriptions and intermediate result thumbnails in the video timeline. Learners in our study performed better and gained more self-efficacy using ToolScape versus a traditional video player. To add the needed step annotations to existing how-to videos at scale, we introduce a novel crowdsourcing workflow. It ex tracts step-by-step structure from an existing video, including step times, descriptions, and before and after images. We in troduce the Find-Verify-Expand design pattern for temporal and visual annotation, which applies clustering, text process ing, and visual analysis algorithms to merge crowd output. The workflow does not rely on domain-specific customiza tion, works on top of existing videos, and recruits untrained crowd workers. We evaluated the workflow with Mechanical Turk, using 75 cooking, makeup, and Photoshop videos on YouTube. Results show that our workflow can extract steps with a quality comparable to that of trained annotators across all three domains with 77 % precision and 81 % recall.

For example, without careful prefetching and buffer management, {{the use of multiple}} alternative playback paths can easily result in playback interruptions. In this paper, we present a full implementation of an <b>interactive</b> branched <b>video</b> <b>player</b> using HTTP-based Adaptive Streaming (HAS) that provides seamless playback even when the users defer their branch path choices to the last possible moment. Our design includes optimized prefetching policies that we derive under a simple optimization framework, effective buffer management of prefetched data, and the use of parallel TCP connections to achieve efficient buffer workahead. Through performance evaluation under a wide range of scenarios, we show that our optimized policies can effectively prefetch data of carefully selected qualities along multiple alternative paths such as to ensure seamless playback, offering users a pleasant viewing experience without playback interruptions...|$|R

I {{must not be}} the only one who finds them oddly compelling–more and more boxes show up on each hit. ” — Anonymous subject <b>Interactive</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Player</b> • Browser video player that guides a worker to label an entity. • First, instructs user to draw a box around an item of interest. • User then adjusts the box when video pauses on the next key frame. Linear Interpolation • The {{simplest}} tracking approach is linear interpolation: b lin t T − t t = b 0 + bT for 0 ≤ t ≤ T T T • But, objects do not necessarily move linearly and can be chaotic. Experiments & Results • Diminishing returns: each click has less impact than previous. • The “Turk philosophy ” is not efficient for video. • Trade-off between CPU cost vs. human cost for max. accuracy. • A visual based tracker can benefit video annotation. • Interactive vision: with modest human effort, we can deploy algorithms that quantify progress in difficult scenarios. Unsolved Problem 1 : No fully automatic solution today is capable of detecting and tracking both the people and the basketball. Unsolved Problem 2 : Building large video data sets is inefficient because frame-by-frame hand labeling is slow, costly, and tedious. Motivations 1. What is the best division of labor for crowdsource video labeling? 2. What are the tradeoffs between automation and manual labeling? 3. Given a fixed budget, what is the best accuracy we can achieve? Contributions • A set of “best-practices ” for crowdsourced video annotation. • In contrast to [1], can interpolate nonlinear paths w/o much effort. • Expanding [2] to analyze tradeoffs between human and CPU cost. • Ability to build massive video data sets under a budget. • A reusable, open source video annotation platform for affordable, research video labeling...|$|E
