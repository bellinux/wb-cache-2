Numerous areas had substantial snowfall deficits before this storm. After several weak Alberta clippers crossed the <b>eastern</b> <b>half</b> of the continent and brought occasional light snowfalls, a large dip in the Northern branch of the jet stream favored a more active pattern, which, as it connected with the southern branch, {{led to the development of}} the storm.|$|E
