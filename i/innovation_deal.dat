30|$|Another {{feature of}} {{financial}} innovations, {{which seems to}} apply mainly to financial instruments, is their combinatorial nature. By combinatorial, we mean that the underlying structure of financial innovations can consist {{of a combination of}} claims. One consequence of this feature is the unbundling of instrument characteristics in ways that allow users of financial innovations (such as investors and borrowers) to pick and choose features of the instrument they desire (Llewellyn, 1992). Another consequence is the high speed of change in financial innovations by simply making new combinations (Lerner and Tufano, 2011). According to Herrera and Schroth (2004), a financial <b>innovation</b> <b>deal</b> (particularly with credit derivatives) must undergo further incremental changes to meet client specifications and improve product quality. This suggests that financial innovations tend to be adaptive and highly customizable to market needs (Rajan, 2006). It is not clear, however, whether this adaptive nature applies to financial innovation in general or to specific sectors or categories. Zachary (2011) finds that financial innovations that are traded in the market are standardized while those created by banks for their clients could be customized. Although the discussion on incremental innovation, combination, and complexity as a feature of financial innovation appears to relate more to innovations in the products category, Mention and Torkelli (2014) suggest that process innovations could also be incremental in nature.|$|E
40|$|In {{light of}} climate change and other {{environmental}} challenges, actors across the globe are currently contemplating how {{to bring about a}} socio-technical shift resulting in increased use of renewable energy technology. Scientists are researching new technologies, policymakers are crafting policy, industrialists are starting up new companies and investors are investing in these companies. Innovation, conceptualized as the Schumpeterian notion of creating ‘new combinations' is central in the process. This thesis deals with innovation. More specifically it deals with innovation in one particular renewable energy technology: bioenergy. It does so through the study of bioenergy in Norway and Sweden. However, where most students of <b>innovation</b> <b>deal</b> with innovation as a result of systemic properties, this thesis is focused on practice, and the factors which feed into innovation practice from an actor-perspective. Inspired by various strands of STS theory, an underlying assumption of the thesis is that innovation is a continuous process which involves a range of actors. To be successful, bioenergy solutions do not only have to work according to technical specifications, they must become successfully integrated elements in Norwegian and Swedish collectives. This leads to studies of the potential interplay between innovators, the technology and various elements in the Norwegian and Swedish society, in other words bioenergy innovation is co-studied with the collective(s) it seeks to become part of. Specifically, this thesis consists of four research papers. All papers are concerned with bioenergy, and can be related to discussions about how innovation occurs, how innovation endeavours are shaped and how we can understand the practice of innovation in a broader setting. The first paper, ‘Organic Innovation' studies innovation practices in the Norwegian bioenergy industry and how this practice is shaped or formatted by new markets, resource availability, new regulations and customer relationships. The second paper ‘curb your enthusiasm' considers how bioenergy is given meaning to in Norwegian and Swedish newspapers, highlighting how this process of meaning attribution leads to a different image of what bioenergy ‘is' in the two countries and how this might affect processes of innovation and diffusion. The third paper, ‘Publics in the pipeline', considers the links between the Swedish and Norwegian ‘public' and the bioenergy industry from an industry perspective. How does the industry construct their publics and how do these constructed publics influence the action of the innovators? The final paper, ‘What we disagree about when we disagree about sustainability', considers scientific, political and industrial disagreements over the status of bioenergy and peat in a climate and sustainability perspective. How can decision makers make strategic decisions about technology development when competing knowledge claims exists about the same technology? The four papers are accompanied by an introductory essay which synthesizes the results from these quite different papers, focusing specifically on how studies of this type can increase our understanding of processes of innovation and socialization of technology.

40|$|In this essay, we {{challenge}} the present dominant {{emphasis in the}} Dutch Innovation Debate {{on the creation of}} technological innovations, the focus on a few core technologies, and the allocation of more financial resources. We argue that managerial capabilities and organizing principles for innovation should have a higher priority on the Dutch Innovation Agenda. Managerial capabilities for <b>innovation</b> <b>deal</b> with cognitive elements such as the capacity to absorb knowledge, create entrepreneurial mindsets, and facilitate managerial experimentation and higher-order learning abilities. These capacities can only be developed by distinctive managerial roles that enhance hierarchy, teaming and shared norms. Utilizing these unique managerial capabilities requires novel organizing principles, such as managing internal rates of change, nurturing self-organization and balancing high levels of exploration and exploitation. These managerial capabilities and organizing principles of innovation create new sources of productivity growth and competitive advantage. The dramatic fall back of the Netherlands in the league of innovative and high productivity countries of the World Economic Forum-Report can be mainly attributed to the present lack in the Netherlands of these key managerial and organizational enablers of innovation and productivity growth. We provide various levers for building unique managerial capabilities and novel organizing principles of innovation. Moreover, we describe the necessary roles that different actors have to play in this innovation arena. In particular, we focus on the often neglected but important role of strategic regulations that speed up innovation and productivity growth. They are the least expensive way to boost innovation in organizations in both the Dutch private and public sector. Finally, we discuss the implications for the Dutch Innovation Agenda. It should start with setting a challenging ambition, namely the return of The Netherlands within the WEF- league of the top-ten most innovative and productive countries of the world. Considering the under-utilization of available knowledge stemming from technological innovations, managerial and organizational determinants of innovation should receive first priority. These determinants have a high strategic relevance and should receive more public recognition. We suggest to organize an annual innovation ranking of the most outstanding Dutch firms, to develop an innovation audit that measures firms’ non-technological innovation capacity, and to create an overall innovation policy for fast diffusion of new managerial capabilities and adequate organizing principles throughout the Dutch private and public sector. In conclusion, we add five new items to the Dutch Innovation Agenda: 1. 	Prioritize administrative innovations Investments in management and organization determinants of absorption of knowledge and its successful application (administrative innovation) should have a higher priority than investments in technological innovations. 2. 	Build new managerial capabilities and develop novel organizing principles For these administrative innovations to succeed, firms have to build managerial capabilities (broad knowledge-base, absorptive capacity, managerial experimentation, higher-order learning) and various management roles (hierarchy, teaming, shared norms) to increase the assimilation of external knowledge and the utilization for innovation. Moreover, they have to develop novel organizing principles that increase internal rates of change, nurture self-organization and synchronize high levels of exploration and exploitation. 3. 	Set levers of innovation by creating selection environments that favor innovation and by redefining the roles of key actors Management has to create a proper organizational context to foster entrepreneurship and innovation (internal selection environment). Governmental agencies have to focus on innovation and productivity enabling strategic regulations (external selection environment). Moreover, research institutes, business schools, and consulting firms should not only focus on technological knowledge, but also on managerial and organizational knowledge for innovation. In the end, private small and large firms and public institutions have to recognize that they all must contribute to the national goal of increasing innovation and productivity growth. 4. 	Create a new challenging national ambition: return of the Netherlands within the top- 10 The Netherlands has to return to the top-ten most innovative and productive countries in the world as reflected in international rankings such as the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index. 5. 	Proliferate an awareness and passion for innovation: Create public awareness and recognition of the societal relevance of outstanding managerial capabilities and organizing principles to innovation and productivity growth: o	Initiate a Dutch innovation ranking in terms of management and organization; o	Develop proper assessment tools for innovations in management and organization; o	Enhance reporting on the progress on managerial and organizational innovation as part of modern corporate governance and as part of outstanding annual reports. These issues may contribute to rethinking the fundamental sources of innovation, productivity growth and sustainable competitive advantage of the Dutch economy...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} {{the framework for}} the creation of whole-body planar acquisitions from Monte Carlo modelling with GATE. The ground truth is a complex model representing a `virtual patient' based on the NCAT-WB anthropomorphic model. Radiopharmaceutical kinetic was generated from compartmental modelling, to assign a time-activity curve (TAC) to each functional compartment. In order to match the kinetic model's functional compartments, the geometrical NCAT-WB model was used to define the corresponding functional volumes, where each geometric voxel results from a linear combination of the functional contributions for that voxel. Image generation was performed by Monte Carlo modelling with GATE. However, Monte Carlo modelling necessitates huge computation times. It is therefore important to save as much time as possible - for example by decreasing the total number of simulations required to generate a dataset. The originality of our approach is twofold: Each functional volume is simulated only once and the resulting output is weighted using the respective TAC, allowing for several image time-points to be generated from the same simulation. The second <b>innovation</b> <b>deals</b> with the way to corrupt images with Poisson noise. The classical way is to simulate enough photons to obtain almost-noiseless projections and then apply a noise filter on the GATE projections. In case of complete simulation of an anthropomorphic model, the simulation time becomes far too long. We propose a method to generate an image with sufficient statistics while preserving the Poisson noise modeled by GATE. We developed a new GATE output which stores in a list the projection pixel indices of the detected photons. It is then possible to build projections with the number of detected events needed for a specific compartment over an acquisition time period. The proposed output is compatible with the generation of SPECT images based on the compartmental approach...|$|R
