25|$|When the King {{toured the}} front (24 October) Haig {{told him that}} Robertson should go home and become CIGS, whilst Robertson told the King (27 October 1915) that Haig should replace French. He was {{promoted}} to permanent lieutenant general on 28 October 1915. Robertson clinched his claim as the future CIGS with a lengthy paper (actually written by Maurice, dated 8 November) “The Conduct of the War”, arguing that all British efforts must be directed at the defeat of Germany. Robertson told Haig from London (15 November 1915), where he was seeing the King and Kitchener, “the first thing is to <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> command”.|$|E
500|$|... "Birthday" [...] {{contains}} elements of funk-pop, synthpop, and disco house. The song {{is backed by}} a [...] "busy but buoyant" [...] instrumentation featuring a [...] "deeply rhythmic impulse". Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times felt [...] "Birthday" [...] was a musically updated version of disco, achieved by replacing [...] "cheesy strings" [...] with [...] "jerky breaks and synth washes". Its [...] "joyful" [...] lyrics present the commemoration of her partner's birthday {{as a metaphor for}} sexual intercourse. The bridge section of [...] "Birthday", which sees Perry singing [...] "Let me <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> your birthday suit / It's time to bring out the big balloons", was found by Ben Rattliff to resemble French duo Daft Punk's works.|$|E
500|$|Malcolm Evans' 3D Monster Maze, {{released}} for the Sinclair ZX81 in 1982, is a first-person game {{without a}} weapon; the player cannot fight the enemy, a Tyrannosaurus Rex, so must escape by finding the exit before the monster finds him. The game states its distance {{and awareness of}} the player, further raising tension. Edge stated it was about [...] "fear, panic, terror and facing an implacable, relentless foe who’s going to <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> the end" [...] and considers it [...] "the original survival horror game". Retro Gamer stated, [...] "Survival horror {{may have been a}} phrase first coined by Resident Evil, but it could’ve easily applied to Malcolm Evans’ massive hit." ...|$|E

500|$|Sir Lucious Left Foot was {{recorded}} {{over a period}} of three years, beginning on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day in 2007. Big Boi has said that he [...] "always start working on albums on Martin Luther King Day. It's a good luck charm". The album was primarily recorded at Stankonia Recording Studio in Atlanta, Georgia, the studio used by OutKast for their previous albums. Additional recording took place at The Dungeon Recording Studios, The Slumdrum Dreamhouse, and King of Crunk in Atlanta, Dungeon East Studios in Decatur, Georgia, Instrumental Zoo in Miami, Florida, and Kush Studios in Palm Island, Florida. Big Boi discussed the Stankonia studio's environment in an interview for The Guardian, calling it [...] "comfortable but gritty enough to <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> a state of mind of being raw and ready to kill stuff", while noting that the sessions were accompanied by [...] "some candles, a little red light, maybe some crunk juice and a cigar; every now and then perhaps a little 'purple'". While searching for a new record label, he completed recording for the album. The album was mastered on May 27, 2010.|$|E
500|$|Darryl Scipio of Vibe stated unlike [...] "today's {{masculine}} R" [...] that is [...] "laden with jokers who sing {{of little}} but freekin' girls—and then of keeping {{it on the}} down-low", Personal doesn't use [...] "wordy descriptions of sex to <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> the mood to dance". Scipio stated that all 12 songs on the album feature [...] "tight, bouncy production" [...] and that {{all the members of}} the group sing confidently; [...] "there are no weak vocals here". He cited [...] "House Keeper" [...] and [...] "Personal" [...] as having the most soul, [...] "but the rest stand solidly". He concluded his review of the album by stating that: [...] "These visionaries are definitely a sound for sore ears". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic compared the group and the musical style of Personal to that of Boyz II Men. Erlewine stated that where Boyz II Men have first-rate professional songwriters and producers, Men of Vizion merely have [...] "competent hacks", which means that [...] "no matter how hard the group tries, they can't make any of these songs memorable". Jai Henry of The Daily Cougar commented that although at times they sound [...] "a little too much" [...] like Blackstreet, Men of Vizion [...] "definitely have their own sound".|$|E
500|$|The battle {{system in}} Medieval: Total War was {{considered}} by many reviewers to be {{the highlight of the}} game. In their review, Eurogamer felt [...] "The sensation of scale and drama in these conflicts is incredible", praising the visual effects and combat. The different battlefields and their environments were praised by IGN, with ActionTrip agreeing that [...] "Medieval: Total War looks better than Shogun", adding that the terrain and units are more detailed than those in Shogun: Total War. GameSpot praised the realistic battles, mentioning that the real-world battlefield considerations like fatigue, ammunition, facing, and morale included in the game was a [...] "welcome change". GameSpy also stated the [...] "chaotic" [...] battles were appropriate to the era, but criticised the siege aspect, claiming it to be [...] "too plain and underwhelming", with a lack of detail compared to the other 3D elements. The soundtrack to the game was well received by IGN, [...] "The soundtrack is full of rousing context-sensitive orchestra moments which <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> the mood for bloody slaughter" [...] commenting it is fitting for a game that [...] "delivers body counts like no other" [...] ActionTrip also admired how the game's music changed pace as the battle commenced, praising The Creative Assembly for its [...] "masterfully placed audio and visual effects". The artificial intelligence for Medieval: Total War was thought to be much improved over its predecessor, CGW mentioning the AI was intelligent enough to prevent brute force alone from winning fights. Criticism was received on the larger battles giving low frame rates and performance, while ActionTrip also noted several unit management issues with path-finding and unit facing, stating [...] "it's demoralising to see archers facing the wrong way".|$|E

2500|$|The use {{of amber}} lights to alert drivers that a spotter vehicle is parked is controversial. Light bars and strobe lights have been {{becoming}} increasingly popular with storm spotters and storm chasers since, proponents claim, both groups often travel {{in less than}} ideal weather conditions where visibility may be limited. However, in recent years, some spotters and chasers have been seen using red, blue, white, and/or green lighting devices, apparently imitating emergency vehicles. Such actions are illegal in most areas and are highly condemned by both the spotter and storm chaser communities. Said Chuck Doswell, [...] "flashing light bars added to your chase vehicle (similar to those used by law enforcement) may be illegal in some places and their use to imply some sort of official status to your chasing {{is probably going to}} <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> trouble". Chris Novy, a trainer of storm spotters throughout the US and a veteran storm chaser, also notes that lights distract and can even unconsciously attract other drivers and that lights may encourage people to drive aggressively or to park in situations they would otherwise avoid and thus increase danger to themselves and to other drivers.|$|E

2500|$|Haig sent {{copies of}} the {{relevant}} orders and a critique of GHQ's conduct of the battle to his wife, who showed them to Stamfordham (10 November) for the King to see. Robertson was working against French, telling Haig (15 November) that [...] "the first thing is to <b>get</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> command". The Prime Minister discussed the matter with the King and Kitchener (both of whom thought French {{not up to the}} job, although Kitchener thought the time not right for a change), and, on 23 November, Haig. Asquith then asked Esher to convey to French in person the news that he must resign, but that he was being offered a peerage and the newly created job of Commander-in-Chief Home Forces. [...] However, French insisted on seeing Asquith again (29 November) at which meeting Asquith told him that he must take the first step and that he was not being [...] "recalled" [...] (sacked). [...] French's official critique of Haig's performance at Loos finally reached the War Office on 1 December. [...] He wrote to Asquith (2 December) suggesting that Kitchener be removed {{to be replaced by a}} civilian Secretary of State to avoid friction with the new job of Commander-in-Chief Home Forces, and writing that he would await Asquith's decision on this point. [...] He returned to France (3 December), but Asquith had been exchanging further letters with Stamfordham and they agreed that French must now be pressed to quit. [...] Walter Long telephoned French (4 December) passing on the Prime Minister's message that he must resign.|$|E
