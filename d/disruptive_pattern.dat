5|$|Many {{military}} camouflage patterns {{since the}} 1940s have been disruptively coloured, {{and with the}} issue of US Woodland pattern to United States armed forces from 1981, <b>disruptive</b> <b>pattern</b> became a dominant feature of military uniforms.

500|$|<b>Disruptive</b> <b>patterns</b> use {{strongly}} contrasting markings such as spots or stripes {{to break}} up the outlines of an animal or military vehicle. Some predators, like the leopard, and some potential prey like the Egyptian nightjar, use <b>disruptive</b> <b>patterns.</b> <b>Disruptive</b> <b>patterns</b> are defined by A.

5|$|<b>Disruptive</b> <b>patterns</b> use {{strongly}} contrasting, non-repeating markings such as spots or stripes {{to break}} up the outlines of an animal or military vehicle, or to conceal telltale features, especially the eyes, as in the common frog. <b>Disruptive</b> <b>patterns</b> may use more than one method to defeat visual systems such as edge detection. Predators like the leopard use disruptive camouflage to help them approach prey, while potential prey like the Egyptian nightjar use it to avoid detection by predators. <b>Disruptive</b> <b>patterning</b> is common in military usage, both for uniforms and for military vehicles. <b>Disruptive</b> <b>patterning,</b> however, does not always achieve crypsis on its own, as an animal or a military target may be given away by factors like shape, shine, and shadow.|$|R

5|$|The {{outlines}} of an animal's body {{can be made}} hard to see by other methods, such as by using a highly irregular outline.

5|$|The root of {{the modern}} multi-scale {{camouflage}} patterns {{can be traced back}} to 1930s experiments in Europe for the German and Soviet armies. This was followed by Canadian development of Canadian <b>Disruptive</b> <b>Pattern</b> (CADPAT), first issued in 2002, and then with US work which created Marine pattern (MARPAT), launched between 2002 and 2004.|$|E
5|$|In the Royal Navy, dazzle paint schemes reappeared in January 1940. These were unofficial, and {{competitions}} {{were often}} held between ships {{for the best}} camouflage patterns. The Royal Navy's Camouflage Department {{came up with a}} scheme devised by a young naval officer, Peter Scott, a wildlife artist, which were developed into the Western Approaches Schemes. In 1942 the Admiralty Intermediate <b>Disruptive</b> <b>Pattern</b> came into use, followed in 1944 by the Admiralty Standard Schemes.|$|E

Some predators, like the leopard, and some potential prey like the Egyptian nightjar, use <b>disruptive</b> <b>patterns.</b> <b>Disruptive</b> <b>patterns</b> are defined by A. Barbosa and colleagues as [...] "characterized by high-contrast light and dark patches, in a nonrepetitive configuration, that also provide camouflage by disrupting the recognizable shape or orientation of the animal", as in the cuttlefish.The strategy appears paradoxical and counter-intuitive as a method of camouflage, since disrupting outlines depends on using patches of colour which contrast strongly with each other, so the patches are themselves conspicuous. While background matching works best for a single background, disruptive coloration is a more effective strategy when an animal or a military vehicle may have a variety of backgrounds.|$|R
40|$|AbstractDisruptive body {{coloration}} is {{a primary}} camouflage tactic of cuttlefish. Because rapid changeable coloration of cephalopods is guided visually, we can present different visual backgrounds (e. g., computer-generated, two-dimensional prints) and video record the animal’s response by describing and grading its body pattern. We showed previously that strength of cuttlefish <b>disruptive</b> <b>patterning</b> depends on the size, contrast, and density of discrete light elements on a homogeneous dark background. Here we report five experiments on the interactions {{of these and other}} features. Results show that Weber contrast of light background elements is—in combination with element size—a powerful determinant of disruptive response strength. Furthermore, the strength of <b>disruptive</b> <b>patterning</b> decreases with increasing mean substrate intensity (with other factors held constant). Interestingly, when element size, Weber contrast and mean substrate intensity are kept constant, strength of <b>disruptive</b> <b>patterning</b> depends on the configuration of clusters of small light elements. This study highlights the interactions of multiple features of natural microhabitats that directly influence which camouflage pattern a cuttlefish will choose...|$|R
40|$|Many prey {{species have}} evolved {{defensive}} colour patterns to avoid attacks. One type of camouflage, disruptive coloration, relies on contrasting patterns that hinder predators' {{ability to recognize}} an object. While high contrasts are used to facilitate detection in many visual communication systems, they are thought to provide misleading information about prey appearance in <b>disruptive</b> <b>patterns.</b> A fundamental tenet in disruptive coloration theory is the principle of ‘maximum disruptive contrast’, i. e. <b>disruptive</b> <b>patterns</b> are more effective when higher contrasts are involved. We tested this principle in highly contrasting stripes that have often been described as <b>disruptive</b> <b>patterns.</b> Varying the strength of chromatic contrast between stripes and adjacent pattern elements in artificial butterflies, we found a strong negative correlation between survival probability and chromatic contrast strength. We conclude that too high a contrast leads to increased conspicuousness rather than to effective camouflage. However, artificial butterflies that sported contrasts {{similar to those of}} the model species Limenitis camilla survived equally well as background-matching butterflies without these stripes. Contrasting stripes do thus not necessarily increase predation rates. This result may provide new insights into the design and characteristics of a range of colour patterns such as sexual, mimetic and aposematic signals...|$|R
5|$|While {{patterns}} {{can provide}} more effective crypsis than solid colour when the camouflaged object is stationary, any pattern, particularly one with high contrast, stands {{out when the}} object is moving. Jungle camouflage uniforms were issued during the Second World War, but both the British and American forces found that a simple green uniform provided better camouflage when soldiers were moving. After the war, most nations returned to a unicoloured uniform for their troops. Some nations, notably Austria and Israel, continue to use solid colour combat uniforms today. Similarly, while larger military aircraft traditionally had a <b>disruptive</b> <b>pattern</b> with a darker top over a lighter lower surface (a form of countershading), modern fast fighter aircraft often wear gray overall.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft {{camouflage}} {{is the use}} of camouflage {{on military}} aircraft to make them more difficult to see, whether on the ground or in the air. Given the possible backgrounds and lighting conditions, no single scheme works in every situation. A common approach has been a form of countershading, the aircraft being painted in a <b>disruptive</b> <b>pattern</b> of ground colors such as green and brown above, sky colors below. For faster and higher-flying aircraft, sky colors have sometimes been used all over, while helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft used close to the ground are often painted entirely in ground camouflage. Aircraft flying by night have often been painted black, but this actually made them appear darker than the night sky, leading to paler night camouflage schemes. There are trade-offs between camouflage and aircraft recognition markings, and between camouflage and weight. Accordingly, visible light camouflage has been dispensed with when air superiority was not threatened or when no significant aerial opposition was anticipated.|$|E
25|$|Rhodesian Brushstroke {{is similar}} to the United Kingdom's <b>Disruptive</b> <b>Pattern</b> Material (DPM). It {{consists}} of large, contrasting, shapes tailored to break up the outline of an object. Like most disruptive camouflage, the pattern is dependent on countershading, utilising hues with high-intensity contrast or noticeable differences in chromaticity.|$|E
40|$|Individual cuttlefish, octopus and squid {{have the}} {{versatile}} capability to use body patterns for background matching and disruptive coloration. We define—qualitatively and quantitatively—the chief {{characteristics of the}} three major body pattern types used for camouflage by cephalopods: uniform and mottle patterns for background matching, and <b>disruptive</b> <b>patterns</b> that primarily enhance disruptiveness but aid background matching as well. There is great variation within each of the three body pattern types, but by defining their chief characteristics we lay the groundwork to test camouflage concepts by correlating background statistics with those of the body pattern. We describe at least three ways in which background matching can be achieved in cephalopods. <b>Disruptive</b> <b>patterns</b> in cuttlefish possess all four of the basic components of ‘disruptiveness’, supporting Cott's hypotheses, and we provide field examples of disruptive coloration in which the body pattern contrast exceeds that of the immediate surrounds. Based upon laboratory testing as well as thousands of images of camouflaged cephalopods in the field (a sample is provided on a web archive), we note that size, contrast and edges of background objects are key visual cues that guide cephalopod camouflage <b>patterning.</b> Mottle and <b>disruptive</b> <b>patterns</b> are frequently mixed, suggesting that background matching and disruptive mechanisms are often used in the same pattern...|$|R
5|$|Fish such as Dascyllus aruanus have bold <b>disruptive</b> <b>patterns</b> {{on their}} sides, {{breaking}} up their outlines with strong contrasts. Fish like Heniochus macrolepidotus have similar bands of colour that extend into fins projecting {{far from the}} body, distracting attention from the true shape of the fish.|$|R

500|$|Cott possessed {{considerable}} artistic skill. Like Abbott Thayer, he {{used his}} artistry in his scientific work, including in Adaptive Coloration in Animals, to help argue the case he was making. [...] For example, his black-and-white potoo shows this rainforest bird sitting motionless on a mottled tree trunk, its behaviour and <b>disruptive</b> <b>pattern</b> combining to provide effective camouflage. The philosopher and jazz musician David Rothenberg wrote of Cott's art: ...|$|E
50|$|Keeled scales scatter light {{differently}} from smooth, flat scales. As a result, most reptiles with keeled scales are not shiny: {{they have a}} dull, non-reflective appearance. It is therefore possible that keeled scales further improve the camouflage effects already provided by skin coloration, countershading and <b>disruptive</b> <b>patterns.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{importance}} of high-contrast patterns for successful disruption was predicted {{in general terms}} by the artist Abbott Thayer in 1909 and explicitly by the zoologist Hugh Cott in 1940.

2500|$|Thayer is {{sometimes}} referred to as the [...] "father of camouflage".

500|$|Hugh Bamford Cott's 500-page book Adaptive Coloration in Animals, {{published}} in wartime 1940, systematically described {{the principles of}} camouflage and mimicry.

500|$|Digital {{camouflage}} patterns, {{widely used}} for uniforms with designs such as CADPAT and MARPAT, {{have been applied}} to the aircraft of some armed forces.

In 2017, a prototype of the Russian air force's Sukhoi Su-57 flew with a countershaded digital camouflage scheme, all dark above except for a multi-scale pattern at the edges.|$|E
500|$|With the {{adoption}} of low-level attack profiles in the mid-1960s, B.1As and B.2s were given a glossy sea grey medium and dark green <b>disruptive</b> <b>pattern</b> camouflage on the upper surfaces, white undersurfaces and [...] "type D" [...] roundels. (The last 13 Vulcan B.2s, XM645 onwards, were delivered thus from the factory). In the mid-1970s: Vulcan B.2s received a similar scheme with matte camouflage, light aircraft grey undersides, and [...] "low-visibility" [...] roundels; B.2(MRR)s received a similar scheme in gloss; and the front half of the radomes were no longer painted black. Beginning in 1979, 10 Vulcans received a wrap-around camouflage of dark sea grey and dark green because, during Red Flag exercises in the US, defending SAM forces had found that the grey-painted undersides of the Vulcan became much more visible against the ground at high angles of bank.|$|E
40|$|Many animals use concealing {{markings}} {{to reduce}} the risk of predation. These include background pattern matching (crypsis), where the coloration matches a random sample of the background and <b>disruptive</b> <b>patterns,</b> whose effectiveness has been hypothesized to lie in breaking up the body into a series of apparently unrelated objects. We have previously established the effectiveness of disruptive coloration against avian predators, using artificial moth-like stimuli with colours designed to match natural backgrounds as perceived by birds. Here, we investigate the mechanism by which <b>disruptive</b> <b>patterns</b> reduce detectability, using a computational vision model of edge detection applied to photographs of our experimental stimuli, calibrated for bird colour vision. We show that, disruptive coloration is effective by exploiting edge detection algorithms that we use to model early visual processing. Thus, ‘false’ edges are detected within the body rather than at its periphery, so inhibiting successful detection of the animal's body outline...|$|R
500|$|<b>Disruptive</b> <b>patterns</b> {{can also}} conceal {{specific}} features. Animals such as fish, birds, frogs and snakes can readily be detected by their eyes, which are necessarily round and dark. Many species conceal the eye with a stripe {{that runs through}} the eye, sometimes contrasting with a stripe above the eye, making it seem just part of a dark area of background. Cott called this a [...] "coincident disruptive pattern".|$|R
50|$|This {{species has}} a {{wingspan}} of 45-52 mm and the forewings are very distinctively shaped with a sharply pointed apex. The common name {{is derived from}} the characteristic markings on the forewings: the base colour is buffish, brown towards the termen, and is marked with a bold v-shaped pink and green marking. Despite this bright colouring, the angular markings provide excellent <b>disruptive</b> <b>patterning</b> camouflage. The hindwings are whitish with darker venation.|$|R
500|$|More favourably, Cott {{explicitly}} recognises Thayer's work on countershading, though granting Edward Bagnall Poulton's partial anticipation {{with his}} work on the chrysalis of the purple emperor butterfly. Further, Cott quotes Thayer's description of countershading, and Cott's Figure 1, of countershaded fish, is captioned [...] "Diagrams illustrating Thayer's principle of obliterative shading". Implicitly, also, Cott follows Thayer in his Figure 3 [...] "Larva of Eyed Hawk-moth" [...] in both [...] "natural (e.g. 'up-side-down')" [...] and [...] "unnatural" [...] positions; in his Figure 5 drawing of the disruptive effect of the stripes and bold markings of woodcock chicks (like Thayer's Figure 81); in his Plate 7, with (just like Thayer's Figure 7) a photograph of a white cock against a white background; in his Figure 18 and front cover drawings of a copperhead snake lying on a bed of leaves, with and without its <b>disruptive</b> <b>pattern</b> (like Thayer's Plate 11) and so on.|$|E
2500|$|The Army's jungle green uniform was {{replaced}} {{in the late}} 1980s by the <b>Disruptive</b> <b>Pattern</b> Camouflage Uniform (DPCU) which was specifically designed by the Defence Science and Technology Organisation and optimised for wear in the semi-arid bush of the Australian mainland. DPCU consists of five-tones with a greenish sand coloured background with randomly arranged spots of orange-brown, mid-brown, leaf-green and very dark green overlaid. At this time brown leather boots also replaced the wear of the black leather general purpose boot when in the field. Later, {{as a result of}} operations in the arid terrain of Iraq and Afghanistan in the 2000s a <b>Disruptive</b> <b>Pattern</b> Desert Uniform (DPDU) was introduced in 2006. Further changes later resulted in the adoption of the Australian Multicam Camouflage Uniform (AMCU), also known as [...] "Multicam" [...] (and similar to that worn by the US Army and British), from 2014.

5|$|Disruptive {{coloration}} (also {{known as}} disruptive camouflage or <b>disruptive</b> <b>patterning)</b> {{is a form}} of camouflage that works by breaking up the outlines of an animal, soldier or military vehicle with a strongly contrasting pattern.
