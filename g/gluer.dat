40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} distributed commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) based software integration by using the concepts of a multi-agent system and the distributed scripting mechanism. COTS software products are increasingly used to be software components in large-scale systems. Most organisations try to gain the promises of rapidly development and lower cost from reusing COTS components. Nevertheless, COTS-based software system development needs an efficient and useful integration approach. We developed a multi-agent system as an execution platform for distributed COTS software products. Instead of an RPC-like invocation approach, we adopt mobile agents to interoperate COTS software. We also developed a scripting mechanism for helping the software integrator to write a <b>gluer.</b> By using our scripting language constructs and the associated rules, a software integrator can easily write various scripts in various styles. To illustrate this multi-agent system, a distributed CPU-utilisation data collection system, is experimented in our study.

40|$|What is the normativity of (linguistic) meaning? What {{exactly does}} this thesis (that meaning is normative) amount to? Is meaning indeed normative, or {{can it be}} naturalistically reduced? The present thesis {{examines}} some arguments, for and against, the thesis that meaning is normative (i. e., the semantic normativity thesis), and through this process of examination it aims {{to arrive at a}} better understanding of how to adequately address the foregoing questions. The first chapter of the present work focuses on Kripke’s seminal views on the normativity of meaning, discussed in his influential book, Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language. A detailed analytical exposition of his so-called “sceptical argument” and “sceptical solution” is provided in the first chapter of this thesis, both of which contain Kripke’s key ideas on the normativity of meaning. The chapter then concludes with an analytical extraction and reconstruction of Kripke’s ideas on the normativity of meaning. The second chapter of this thesis examines an argument in support of semantic normativity, called the “simple argument. ” It then proceeds to examine how <b>Gluer</b> and Wikforss attack this simple argument for the normativity of meaning. The chapter then presents a further criticism of <b>Gluer</b> and Wikforss’s criticisms of the simple argument. After this, two key distinctions, between use and application, and between performative application and application implied in use, are elaborated. The chapter concludes with a discussion of how these foregoing distinctions drawn help to explain a key step in Kripke’s sceptical argument, namely, the generalizing step. The third and last chapter of this thesis examines another argument in support of semantic normativity, called the “meaning proposal argument” (MPA). MPA, it is argued in this chapter, is untenable and should be discarded. Then, the chapter proceeds to discuss Gampel’s elaboration of a key feature of semantic normativity present in Kripke’s discussions, namely, the context of use. Finally, the last section of the chapter utilizes Gampel’s distinctions, as well as the distinctions that have been drawn in the previous (second) chapter, in approaching and addressing the central issue of whether or not meaning is normative. This final section argues that although meaning is not intrinsically normative, it is noncategorically normative, and furthermore, some considerations are given in support of the thesis that meaning is also essentially normative. published_or_final_versionPhilosophyDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I will defend analyticity. Quine has criticized analyticity. To answer Quine’s challenge, P. Boghossian distinguishes metaphysical analyticity and {{epistemological}} analyticity. He argues that epistemological analyticity exists while metaphysical analyticity does not. But, T. Williamson further rejects epistemological analyticity. In this thesis, I will defend both metaphysical analyticity and epistemological analyticity. In chapter I, I will generally define and discuss four conceptions of analyticity. I {{will show that}} there are different readings of each conception of analyticity. In chapter II, I will criticize K. <b>Glüer,</b> Hofmann & Horvath, and G. Russell’s arguments. They attempt to defend metaphysical analyticity. I will show that their arguments fail. To answer Quine’s challenge and to salve analyticity, Boghossian resorts to implicit definition and Glock suggests a normative view of analyticity. In chapter III, I will argue that their efforts fail. In chapter IV, I will defend metaphysical analyticity in a new perspective. The new perspective holds that metaphysical analyticity is true in virtue of concepts rather than meanings. I will argue that, analytic propositions are about the logical relations of realities. And these logical relations are the projections of our conceptual systems. So, the truth of analytic statements is completely determined by concepts they contain. And then, in chapter V, I will explain how concepts could completely determine the truth of analytic statements. Basing on some theories of concepts, I will show that the truth of analytic statements {{could be explained by}} means of the structure of concepts. In chapter VI, I will defend epistemological analyticity. T. Williamson has rejected epistemological analyticity. I will argue that Williamson’s argument fails. I will show that his definitions of analyticity are improper. published_or_final_versionPhilosophyDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{we focus}} on {{developing}} language extensions and frameworks, which offer a declarative way of defining the elements involved in the instance level software composition. We focus on two challenges specific to the instance-level integration step; the two contributions proposed {{as a solution to}} each of these challenges both present declarative approaches for implementing specific concerns. These concerns are; 1. selecting objects based on how they are used in a system and, 2. non-intrusive implementation and injection of adapters. The first challenge is the difficulty of selecting objects based on other criteria than the type system. This is important during integration since, independent of their type, objects can become relevant to a component when they participate in specific events; i. e., which phase of their life-cycle they are in. Selecting objects according to such phase shifts results in scattered and tangled code. To handle these problems, we introduce a novel aspect-oriented concept, called instance pointcuts, for maintaining sets that contain objects with a specified usage history. Specifics are provided in terms of pointcut-like declarations selecting events in the life-cycle of objects. The instance pointcuts approach adds a new dimension to modularity by providing a fine-grained mechanism and a declarative syntax to create and maintain phase-specific object sets. The second challenge is establishing common interfaces between instances while maintaining loose coupling. To this end we have created an adaptation framework, called zamk, which unites dependency injection with under-the-hood adaptation logic. Due to limitations we have identified in the traditional adapter pattern, we have created the concept of converters. Converter classes are defined by the user and managed by the zamk runtime; consequently the only dependency that needs to be introduced during integration is calls to the zamk API. zamk comes with its own dependency injection with its own domain-specific language called <b>gluer.</b> We automate the adaptation process by exploiting the type hierarchies and provide checks and context-relevant messages for correct integration. As a result the zamk framework provides a non-intrusive approach for adapting and binding software, which supports code reuse, software maintainability and evolution...|$|E
40|$|Nanoparticles (NPs) are {{promising}} tools in medical fields, both in diagnosis and therapy (Schlorf et al., 2012; Wickline and Lanza, 2008). Despite this high applicative potential, {{little is known}} about their interaction with biological systems, almost in terms of endocytic pathways and toxicity. The first step to develop a good drug delivery systems based on NPs is to well characterize these molecular aspects. Thus, in this work, with a quantitative and qualitative approach, we studied the uptake of two representative sizes of polystyrene nanoparticles (PS-NPs), 44 nm (NP 44) and 100 nm (NP 100), labeled with FITC and ROD, respectively, in human adenocarcinoma gastric cells (AGS). The experiments were performed after exposure with 10 μg/mL NPs for different times of incubation and temperatures (37 °C and 4 °C), with or without well known endocytosis inhibitor drugs (dynasore for clathrin dependent pathways and EIPA for macropinocytosis/phagocytosis). Quantitative spectrofluorimetric assays reveal a time-dependent kinetics of internalization at 37 °C, with maximum values after 30 min and a decrease after 1 h for both NPs sizes. Precisely, NP 44 show a high rate of uptake and a quickly internalization compared to NP 100 (Fig. 1). Fluorescent images demonstrate that NPs are able to accumulate in the cytoplasm after 1 and 4 h, without reaching cell nuclei. However, NP 100 tend to form aggregate after long exposition times (Fig. 3), while NP 44 present an uniform cytoplasmatic distribution at all times considered (Fig. 4). Endocytosis inhibition tests show a null internalization at 4 ° C and a strong reduction of the uptake rate after treatment with dynasore for both NPs; EIPA, instead, partially affects NPs uptake (Fig. 2). In conclusion, in this study, we demonstrated that PS-NPs are internalized by AGS cells in a size and time dependent manner; probably, as suggest by other authors, they undergo a release process (Iversen et al., 2011). Moreover, we show that this uptake occurs through an energy dependent mechanism and that clathrin mediated endocytosis seems to be the privileged endocytic pathway for PS-NPs.

40|$|A {{software}} system {{is comprised of}} parts, which interact through shared interfaces. Certain qualities of integration, such as loose-coupling, requiring minimal changes to the software and fine-grained localisation of dependencies, have impact on the overall software quality. Current general-purpose languages do not have features that target these integration qualities at the instance level, hence they lack expressive power to define integration-specific code. As a result integration requires invasive code alterations, tightly coupled components that hinder maintainability and reuse. In this thesis, we focus on developing language extensions and frameworks, which offer a declarative way of defining the elements involved in the instance level software composition. Our motivation is that nonintrusive means of integration at the granularity of the instance level {{has an impact on}} the maintainability and the extensibility of the software. We focused on declarativeness since we want to improve how integration concerns are expressed in the implementation. We particularly focus on two challenges specific to the instance-level integration step; the two contributions proposed as a solution to each of these challenges both present declarative approaches for implementing specific concerns. These concerns are; 1. selecting objects based on how they are used in a system and, 2. non-intrusive implementation and injection of adapters. The first challenge is the difficulty of selecting objects based on other criteria than the type system. This is important during integration since, independent of their type, objects can become relevant to a component when they participate in specific events. Such events mark the phases in the life-cycle of objects. The phase in which an object currently is, affects how it is handled in an application; however phase shifts are oftenimplicit. Selecting objects according to such phase shifts results in scattered and tangled code. To handle these problems, we introduce a novel aspect-oriented concept, called instance pointcuts, for maintaining sets that contain objects with a specified usage history. Specifics are provided in terms of pointcut-like declarations selecting events in the life-cycle of objects. Instance pointcuts can be reused, by refining their selection criteria, e. g., by restricting the scope of an existing instance pointcut; and they can be composed, e. g., by set operations. These features make instance pointcuts easy to evolve according to new requirements. The instance pointcuts approach adds a new dimension to modularity by providing a fine-grained mechanism and a declarative syntax to create and maintain phase-specific object sets. The second challenge we have tackled is establishing common interfaces between instances while maintaining loose coupling. To this end we have created an adaptation framework, called zamk, which unites dependency injection with under-the-hood adaptation logic. Due to limitations we have identified in the traditional adapter pattern, such as an increased number of dependencies and implementation challenges due to dependence on type inheritance, we have created the concept of converters, which are annotated classes that adhere to a specific structure. Converter classes do not have to inherit from other classes to implement the adaptation logic. They are defined by the user and managed by the zamk runtime; consequently the only dependency that needs to be introduced during integration is calls to the zamk API. zamk comes with its own dependency injection mechanism that is used with a designated domain-specific language called <b>Gluer.</b> The dependency injection logic is intertwined with the adaptation logic which queries a registry of converters to perform automated adaptation between two types. We automate the adaptation process by exploiting the type hierarchies and provide checks and context-relevant messages for correct integration. As a result the zamk framework provides a non-intrusive approach for adapting and binding software, which supports code reuse, software maintainability and evolution...|$|E
