5|$|All battleships are top {{heavy and}} tend to settle upside down when they sink. Arkansas settled upside down, but a 1989 diver's sketch of the wreck shows hardly any of the {{starboard}} side of the hull, making it look like the ship is lying on <b>her</b> <b>side.</b> Most of the starboard side is present, but severely compacted.|$|E
5|$|As World War II was beginning, Sophie's Jewish parents {{sent her}} away from Austria. She was on board of the MS St. Louis when it was turned away from Cuba {{and sent to the}} United Kingdom.

5|$|During the battle, Oryol was {{probably}} hit by five 12-inch, two , nine , thirty-nine 6-inch shells, and 21 smaller rounds or fragments. Although {{the ship had}} many large holes in the unarmored portions of <b>her</b> <b>side,</b> she was only moderately damaged as all of the four (one 12-inch and three 6-inch) shells that hit <b>her</b> <b>side</b> armor failed to penetrate. The left gun of her forward 12-inch turret had been struck by an 8-inch shell that broke off its muzzle and another 8-inch shell struck {{the roof of the}} rear 12-inch turret and forced it down, which limited the maximum elevation of the left gun. Two 6-inch gun turrets had been jammed by hits from 8-inch shells and one of them had been burnt out by an ammunition fire. Another turret had been damaged by a 12-inch shell that struck its supporting tube. Splinters from two 6-inch shells entered the conning tower and wounded Yung badly enough that he later died of his wounds. Casualties totaled 43 crewmen killed and approximately 80 wounded.|$|E
5|$|Edward VI died on 6 July 1553, aged 15. His will swept {{aside the}} Succession to the Crown Act 1543, {{excluded}} both Mary and Elizabeth from the succession, and instead declared as his heir Lady Jane Grey, granddaughter of Henry VIII's sister Mary Tudor, Queen of France. Lady Jane was proclaimed queen by the Privy Council, but her support quickly crumbled, {{and she was}} deposed after nine days. On 3 August 1553, Mary rode triumphantly into London, with Elizabeth at <b>her</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
5|$|Helena, as promised, lived {{close to}} the Queen, and both she and Beatrice {{performed}} duties for her. Beatrice, whom Victoria had groomed for the main role at <b>her</b> <b>side,</b> carried out the more important duties, and Helena took on the more minor matters that Beatrice {{did not have time}} to do. In later years, Helena was assisted by her unmarried daughter, Helena Victoria, to whom the Queen dictated her journal in the last months of her life.|$|E

5|$|Zoe {{is found}} not guilty of Sarah's murder, due to the court believing Sarah {{committed}} suicide. After Lydia catches Mike kissing Zoe, she goes to Amy and tells her what she saw, and tells her she believes Zoe {{is trying to get}} Mike on <b>her</b> <b>side</b> {{to make it look like}} she is innocent. Lydia expresses her doubts with Mike, still trying to blame Zoe for Sarah's death. However, after realising she could try to get Zoe on <b>her</b> <b>side,</b> she pleads with her to forgive her and move into the Barnes family home. An angry Zoe throws her out. Zoe then approaches Lydia and apologises. The pair slowly become friends. However, Zoe is only pretending in order to get a confession. Lydia and Zoe kiss as part of Zoe's plan to expose Lydia as Sarah's killer. Mike throws Zoe out of the flat.|$|E
5|$|After {{her return}} to International Mercantile Marine (IMM), the ship {{underwent}} a refit at the W. & A. Fletcher Marine Works yard in Hoboken that outfitted her for 242 first-, 310 second-, and 876 third-class passengers. On 8 January 1920, while Kroonland was still under repair, the American Line ship , berthed next {{to her at the}} Fletcher yard, caught fire. In the multi-alarm fire, firefighters believed that St. Louis was a lost cause, and so focused their efforts on saving Kroonland. At one point, St. Louis heeled over and leaned on Kroonland but the only resulting damages were scorch marks on <b>her</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E

5|$|After riding {{at anchor}} for two weeks, Endeavour was heaved {{out of the}} water on 9 November and laid on <b>her</b> <b>side</b> for repairs. Some damaged timbers were found to be infested with shipworms, which {{required}} careful removal to ensure they did not spread throughout the hull. Broken timbers were replaced and the hull recaulked, scraped of shellfish and marine flora, and repainted. Finally, the rigging and pumps were renewed and fresh stores brought aboard for the return journey to England. Repairs and replenishment were completed by Christmas Day 1770, and the next day Endeavour weighed anchor and set sail westward towards the Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|After {{winning the}} toss, New Zealand captain Haidee Tiffen opted to bat first. <b>Her</b> <b>side</b> were bowled out in 47.2 overs {{for a total}} of 166 runs. All-rounder Lucy Doolan, batting at number nine, was the highest scorer for New Zealand with 48. England bowler Nicky Shaw took a career-best four wickets for 34 runs. In their response, England built an opening {{partnership}} of 74 runs and continued to score steadily. Despite regularly losing wickets, they reached the winning total with 23 balls to spare, earning England their first World Cup title for 16 years. Shaw, who had initially not been included in the England team, was named player of the match after replacing the injured Jenny Gunn just minutes {{before the start of the}} match.|$|E
5|$|Amira goes to Yusef for help, {{saying she}} needs him on <b>her</b> <b>side,</b> {{threatening}} to tell Zainab that Yusef {{bought her a}} plane ticket {{if he does not}} help her get Syed back. She convinces Zainab to talk to Yusef, and when Yusef sees 15-year-old Ben Mitchell (Joshua Pascoe), who has recently come out as homosexual, running out of Christian's flat, he asks if Christian acted inappropriately. At first Ben says nothing happened but later Ben tells Yusef that Christian touched him, and they tell Ben's father, Phil. This turns out to be untrue, but leads to Christian leaving Syed and Walford.|$|E

5|$|Around noon, as {{a result}} of poor {{coordination}} and signaling, the Swedish line unexpectedly turned toward the allied fleet. When the flagship Kronan came about in the maneuver it suddenly heeled over and began to take in water. According to master gunner Anders Gyllenspak, the sails were not reefed and the ship leaned over so hard that water flooded in through the lower gunports. As the ship was leaning over, a gust of wind pushed the ship on <b>her</b> <b>side,</b> bringing her masts and sails down in line with the surface of the sea. Shortly afterwards, the gunpowder store exploded and ripped the forward section of the starboard side apart. Kronan quickly lost buoyancy and sank, taking most of her 850-man crew with her.|$|E
5|$|By July 1929 {{the last}} of the {{superstructure}} had been cleared, and Bremse was turned upside down using techniques developed on salvaging some of the destroyers. Compressors were then used to pump air into the hull and bring her to the surface, while she was supported by 9-inch wires attached to two floating docks anchored on her port shoreward side. The salvage teams had almost raised her when she suddenly toppled onto <b>her</b> <b>side</b> and then heeled over gradually during the night, settling onto the rocks inshore.|$|E
5|$|During that night, a storm blew up and {{approximately}} 200 soldiers {{were assigned to}} the task of restraining the airship in the gale-force winds. On Saturday morning, the wind was strong enough to pull some of the iron pickets anchoring the airship out of the ground so that she swung broadside to the wind, causing her to tip on <b>her</b> <b>side,</b> which in turn caused sacks of ballast to be released. Even then the Patrie could have been saved; had the release cord been attached to the gas-bag, a single tug on the cord would have been enough to release the hydrogen and save the ship. An oversight led to this not being done, the troops were unable to keep control her and thus could not continue to hold her down in the storm.|$|E
