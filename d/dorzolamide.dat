The {{purpose of the present}} study was to investigate whether timolol, which belongs to another group of glaucoma drugs called beta blockers, has a similar effect. In addition, the effect of <b>dorzolamide</b> and timolol in combination was studied. METHODS: Polarographic oxygen electrodes were placed transvitreally over the optic disc in anaesthetised pigs and ONPO(2) was recorded continually. Drugs were administered intravenously either as 100 mg timolol followed by 500 mg <b>dorzolamide</b> (n = 5), 500 mg <b>dorzolamide</b> followed by 100 mg timolol (n = 5), or 100 mg timolol and 500 mg <b>dorzolamide</b> given simultaneously (n = 5). Arterial blood pressure, blood gasses, and heart rate were recorded. RESULTS: ONPO(2) was unaffected by administration of 100 mg timolol as an intravenous injection (n = 5). Administration of 500 mg <b>dorzolamide</b> by itself significantly increased ONPO(2) from 2. 96 (SD 0. 62) kPa to 3. 69 (SD 0. 88) kPa (n = 4, p = 0. 035).

Topically applied carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs) in eye drop solutions are commonly used to treat glaucoma. However, local eye irritation and multiple daily administrations may hamper their clinical usefulness. Aqueous eye drop formulations that improve their topical bioavailability and reduce their eye irritation can improve their clinical efficacy. Earlier studies showed that <b>dorzolamide</b> and closely related CAIs are more effectively delivered into the eye from acidic eye drop solutions than from comparable neutral solutions. Consequently, <b>dorzolamide</b> was marketed as an aqueous pH 5. 6 eye drop solution (Trusopt(®), Merck). Later, it was shown that increasing the pH of the eye drops from pH 5. 6 to physiologic pH significantly reduced their local irritation. Earlier attempts to use cyclodextrins (CDs) as ocular penetration enhancers in <b>dorzolamide</b> eye drop solutions failed since; although the CDs were able to enhance the aqueous solubility of <b>dorzolamide,</b> increasing the pH from 5. 6 to physiologic pH reduced {{the ability of the}} drug to permeate into the eye. Later, it was discovered that formulating the drug as aqueous dorzolamide/γCD eye drop microparticle suspension resulted in significant bioavailability enhancement. The solid dorzolamide/γCD microparticles are mucoadhesive and release <b>dorzolamide</b> into the aqueous tear fluid for extended time period.

Posttreatment changes in the IOP of albino rabbits were monitored using a rebound tonometer over a 5 -h time course. Changes in IOP after application of saline served as the control. One-way analysis of variance and Dunnett’s post hoc tests were used for statistical analyses. Results: After topical instillation, 0. 4 % ripasudil resulted in significant decreases in IOP at 0. 5 and 1  h compared with the control group.

40|$|Three Simple, precise, {{accurate}} and economical UV {{methods have been}} developed and validated for the quantitative estimation of <b>Dorzolamide</b> HCl in bulk and pharmaceutical dosage form. <b>Dorzolamide</b> HCl has the absorbance maxima at 253 nm in zero order spectra (Method A). In the first order derivative spectra, showed absorbance maxima at 238 nm (Method B) {{and in the second}} order derivative spectra, showed peak maxima at 278 nm (Method C). Distilled water was used as solvent for all the methods. Beer’s law was found to be obeyed in the concentration range of 3 - 24 μg/ml. The developed method was validated according to ICH guidelines and was found to be accurate, economic and precise. The proposed method can be successfully applied for the estimation of <b>Dorzolamide</b> HCl in bulk and pharmaceutical dosage forms.

40|$|X-linked {{juvenile}} retinoschisis (XLRS) is a recessively inherited vitreoretinal degeneration {{characterized by}} macular pathology and splitting of the neuroretinal layers that {{is associated with}} alterations in the XLRS 1 gene. There have been no therapeutic interventions known to be effective for patients with X-linked juvenile retinoschisis, but some studies are trying to determine the importance of <b>dorzolamide</b> for the treatment of foveal lesions in this disease. The authors, using optical coherence tomography, describe findings in a patient with X-linked juvenile retinoschisis, before and after a topical use of <b>dorzolamide.</b> Besides the improvement in his visual acuity, further studies are required to elucidate the real prevalence of nonresponse to <b>dorzolamide</b> and the frequency with which there may be a recurrence of foveal cystic changes during continued treatment...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Cost is {{an issue}} when {{prescribing}} two drugs with equivalent efficacy. We compared the direct medical costs of topical brinzolamide 1 % (twice a day or three times daily) with topical <b>dorzolamide</b> 2 % (twice a day or three times daily) in France, Italy, Portugal and Spain in patients with ocular hypertension or primary open-angle glaucoma. Design and setting: Three double-blind, controlled, randomised trials (with a study duration of 3 months) compared the response rate of brinzolamide twice a day or three times daily versus <b>dorzolamide</b> three times daily, and the response rate of brinzolamide-timolol twice a day versus a dorzolamide-timolol combination twice a day. A fourth double-blind randomised trial (with a duration of 12 months) compared brinzolamide twice a day and three times daily with timolol monotherapy. Local tolerance was compared in two dedicated studies. Rates of switching to a new medication regimen were evaluated through a US health maintenance organisation database. In case of treatment failure, the patients were treated with latanoprost. A model was developed to value direct medical costs over 3 months. The economic perspective {{was that of the}} third-party payer and the patient, and included direct medical costs (reimbursed part plus co-payment). Patients: Patients with ocular hypertension and/or primary open-angle glaucoma who had not responded to or could not tolerate beta-blocker therapy. Outcome measure: The daily direct medical costs of therapy with the two drugs. Results: As monotherapy, brinzolamide twice daily and three times daily was found to be as efficacious as <b>dorzolamide</b> three times a day. Brinzolamide twice daily plus timolol was also as efficacious as a combination of <b>dorzolamide</b> and timolol twice a day. Stinging of the eye upon instillation with brinzolamide was experienced by fewer patients than with <b>dorzolamide</b> (pAntiglaucomas, Brinzolamide, Cost minimisation, <b>Dorzolamide,</b> Glaucoma, Ocular hypertension, Pharmacoeconomics...|$|E

METHODS: Fifteen patients with OAG were evaluated in a randomised, cross-over, double-blind study. They were treated with either brinzolamide or <b>dorzolamide</b> for 3 months and then crossed-over after a 4 -week washout period. They were given timolol during a 4 -week run-in period and during washout. The following were performed after run-in, after washout and after each treatment period: adverse events check, measurement of visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, blood pressure, heart rate, and intraocular pressure, and fundus examination. Ocular blood flow was assessed using confocal scanning laser Doppler flowmetry (HRF) and colour Doppler imaging (CDI). Retinal oxygenation levels were determined using a non-invasive measurement of haemoglobin oxygen saturation by digital photographic fundus oximetry. RESULTS: Both brinzolamide and <b>dorzolamide</b> {{reduced the number of}} zero-flow pixels in the retina as measured by HRF, suggesting an increase in retinal blood flow (- 6. 86 and - 0. 452 respectively) with brinzolamide treatment resulting in fewer zero-flow pixels than <b>dorzolamide</b> (- 6. 41) (p = 0. 024). Both brinzolamide and <b>dorzolamide</b> increased oxygen saturation in the retina as measured by photographic retinal oximetry in the superior (0. 82 (p = 0. 002) and 0. 87 (p = 0. 005)) and inferior (0. 88 (p = 0. 035) and 0. 82 (p = 0. 002)) retinal veins. No significant changes were found in CDI measurements of the retrobulbar blood supply during either treatment. CONCLUSION: This pilot study suggests that brinzolamide and <b>dorzolamide</b> may increase retinal oxygen saturation in patients with OAG...|$|E

Please click on the hyperlink in Additional Links fieldBACKGROUND: Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs) increase blood flow {{in the brain and}} probably also in the optic nerve and retina. Additionally they elevate the oxygen tension in the optic nerve in the pig. We propose that they also raise the oxygen tension in the retina. We studied the oxygen tension in the pig retina and optic nerve before and after <b>dorzolamide</b> injection. Also the retinal vessel diameters during carbonic anhydrase inhibition were studied. METHODS: A polarographic oxygen electrode was placed transvitreally immediately over the retina or the optic disc in anaesthetised pigs. The oxygen tension was recorded continually and 500 mg <b>dorzolamide</b> was injected intravenously. Retinal vessel diameters were analysed from monochromatic fundus photographs taken before and after injection of <b>dorzolamide.</b> RESULTS: Baseline retinal oxygen tension (RPO 2) was 3. 34 +/- 0. 50 kPa (mean +/- SD, n= 6) and baseline optic nerve oxygen tension (ONPO 2) was 3. 63 +/- 1. 00 kPa. RPO 2 was increased by 0. 36 +/- 0. 11 kPa (n= 6, P= 0. 025) and ONPO 2 by 0. 73 +/- 0. 34 kPa (n= 6, P= 0. 003) 30 min after <b>dorzolamide</b> administration. The retinal arterioles was significantly dilated by 13 +/- 7 % (n= 5, P= 0. 016) and the retinal venules by 12 +/- 8 % (n= 5, P= 0. 030) 30 min after injection of <b>dorzolamide.</b> CONCLUSION: Retinal and optic nerve oxygen tension increased with systemic administration of <b>dorzolamide.</b> The retinal vessels dilated, probably causing increased blood flow inducing the observed increase in RPO 2. The increased oxygenation of retina by CAI may offer therapeutic possibilities in ischaemic diseases of the retina and optic nerve...|$|E
