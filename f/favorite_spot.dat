25|$|In 1989, {{the hotel}} closed to undergo an {{extensive}} renovation that lasted two years, and cost $160 million. The hotel reopened on September 16, 1991. While {{the hotel was}} restored to the grand style of its 1915 heyday, significant changes were made. All guest rooms were converted to suites. In addition, Long Bar, which was a <b>favorite</b> <b>spot</b> of celebrities such as Somerset Maugham, was relocated from the lobby to a new adjoining shopping arcade. Long Bar is also where the national cocktail, the Singapore Sling was invented by bartender Ngiam Tong Boon.|$|E
25|$|One day he {{suddenly}} finds {{the energy to}} get out of bed and rededicates himself to architecture, something Summer had pressured him to do. He makes a list of firms he wants to work for, assembles a portfolio, and goes to job interviews. On day 488, Summer is waiting for Tom at his <b>favorite</b> <b>spot</b> in the city and they talk. Summer explains that Tom was right about true love existing; he was just wrong about it being with her. She says she got married because she felt sure about her husband, something she wasn't with Tom. Summer puts her hand on Tom's and says she is glad to see he is doing well. As she leaves, Tom tells her he really hopes she is happy.|$|E
25|$|The L-shaped {{layout of}} the massive building, {{together}} with adjacent constructions, and the surrounding brick and masonry fence, hides to the local transient the open and greenish interior patio of the residence. The patio can be access through the zaguan, the carport, or directly from the upper level eastern end, using a brick and masonry half-turn with landing staircase. As of 2013 the house was vacant, and thus the small urban courtyard-backyard reflects abandonment. However, there are certain built elements within the area that still warrant further description. Most important {{of these is the}} marble flared stair, identical to the zaguan staircase (but with one less riser) and the iron grilled gate, which replicates also the zaguans iron gate. Many early twentieth century Vives' family photos at the patio, using the staircase as stage, suggest the social importance of the location. A water fountain sits {{at the center of the}} patio, another <b>favorite</b> <b>spot</b> for early 20th century family photos. There are two separate brick and masonry constructions in a precarious state, currently used as construction material storage area. During the 19th century, the buildings were use as residence for the service personnel.|$|E

500|$|Gates {{continued}} his heavy betting on horse races {{when in the}} United States.

[...] At yet another race, Gates won US$650,000 from his large bets.

Outside of his own hotel suite, Gates' <b>favorite</b> <b>spot</b> in New York City was the gambling establishment opened by Richard Canfield in 1898. The club was at 5 East 44th Street. [...] Delmonico's was next door and provided catering to the club's guests. When there or at Canfield's Saratoga clubhouse, Gates' favored game was faro which he had learned while selling barbed wire in Texas.|$|E
500|$|In the mid-1920s the German {{government}} established {{relations with}} Moscow {{and the presence}} of Kirill and his wife, pretenders to the Russian throne, became an embarrassment. [...] Although the Bavarian government rejected pressures to expel the Russian claimant, Kirill and Victoria decided to establish their permanent residence in France. In the summer of 1926 they moved to Saint-Briac on the Breton coast, where they had spent their summer vacations before. The remoteness of Brittany provided both privacy and security. They bought a large house {{on the outskirts of the}} town and gave it a Breton name, Ker Argonid, Villa Victoria. The resort town of Saint-Briac was a <b>favorite</b> <b>spot</b> for retired British citizens who wanted to live well on a limited income. Victoria made friends among the Britons as well as the French and other foreign residents of the town. Though at first her manner could seem haughty, residents soon discovered that Victoria was more approachable than her husband. Their friends treated them with deference, curtsying or calling them by their imperial titles. They lived a secluded country life, finding it more agreeable than at Coburg.|$|E

It became a <b>favorite</b> <b>spot</b> among locals, offering magnificent vistas of the Statue of Liberty, the Manhattan skyline across the East River, the Brooklyn Bridge, the Manhattan Bridge, and spectacular fireworks displays over the East River.

2500|$|Tom shows Summer his <b>favorite</b> <b>spot</b> in the city, which overlooks {{a number}} of {{buildings}} he likes, though the view is somewhat spoiled by parking lots.

[...] The Crow used this place annually in the autumn, a place of multiple cliffs along a ridge that eventually sloped to the creek. Early {{in the morning the}} day of the jump a medicine man would stand {{on the edge of the}} upper cliff, facing up the ridge. He would take a pair of bison hindquarters and pointing the feet along the lines of stones he would sing his sacred songs and call upon the Great Spirit to make the operation a success. After this invocation the medicine man would give the two head drivers a pouch of incense. As the two head drivers and their helpers headed up the ridge and the long line of stones they would stop and burn incense on the ground repeating this process four times. The ritual was intended to make the animals come to the line where the incense was burned, then bolt back to the ridge area.|$|E
