5|$|Fishing {{industry}} is a major enterprise as Romblon is surrounded by water on all sides. The fishing grounds of Romblon are a migratory path of fish from Sulu and Visayan Seas passing Tablas Strait, Sibuyan Sea and Romblon Pass. The waters also abound with <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> due to the coral reefs surrounding the islands.|$|E
5|$|Flatfish are <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> (bottom-feeding fish) {{that show}} {{a greater degree}} of {{asymmetry}} than any other vertebrates. The larvae are at first bilaterally symmetrical but they undergo metamorphosis during the course of their development, with one eye migrating {{to the other side of}} the head, and they simultaneously start swimming on their side. This has the advantage that, when they lie on the seabed, both eyes are on top, giving them a broad field of view. The upper side is usually speckled and mottled for camouflage, while the underside is pale.|$|E
5|$|The thick {{shell and}} rounded shape of {{bivalves}} make them awkward for potential predators to tackle. Nevertheless, {{a number of}} different creatures include them in their diet. Many species of <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> feed on them including the common carp (Cyprinus carpio), which is being used in the upper Mississippi River to try to control the invasive zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha). Birds such as the Eurasian oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus) have specially adapted beaks which can pry open their shells. The herring gull (Larus argentatus) sometimes drops heavy shells onto rocks in order to crack them open. Sea otters feed on a variety of bivalve species and have been observed to use stones balanced on their chests as anvils on which to crack open the shells. The Pacific walrus (Odobenus rosmarus divergens) {{is one of the main}} predators feeding on bivalves in Arctic waters. Shellfish have formed part of the human diet since prehistoric times, a fact evidenced by the remains of mollusc shells found in ancient middens. Examinations of these deposits in Peru has provided a means of dating long past El Niño events because of the disruption these caused to bivalve shell growth.|$|E

50|$|For the UK fleet as a whole, {{over the}} past 15 {{years there has been}} a sharp declne in <b>demersal</b> <b>fishing,</b> a {{fluctuating}} but relatively stationary situation for pelagic fish and an increase in Norway lobster (nephrops) fisheries. Since most of the pelagic and <b>demersal</b> <b>fishing</b> is carried out by North Sea-based vessels, it is the nephrops fishery that dominates the fisheries economy for ports facing the west of Scotland waters.|$|R
40|$|Pelagic and {{demersal}} guilds of piscivorous fishes {{are linked}} {{by a variety}} of biological and physical processes that mediate interactions with common prey species. Understanding the behaviors of predators and prey can provide insight into the conditions that make such linkages possible. Here we report on the behaviors of mid-water piscivorous fishes and the responses of prey that produce feeding opportunities for <b>demersal</b> piscivorous <b>fishes</b> associated with "live bottom" ledge habitats off the coast of Georgia (northwest Atlantic Ocean). Prey taxa reduced nearest neighbor distances and retreated towards the seafloor during predatory attacks by mid-water <b>fishes.</b> <b>Demersal</b> <b>fishes</b> subsequently attacked and consumed prey in these ephemeral high density patches. No predation by <b>demersal</b> <b>fishes</b> was observed when prey species were at background densities. If the predator-prey interactions of <b>demersal</b> piscivorous <b>fishes</b> are commonly mediated by the predatory behavior of midwater piscivorous fishes and their prey, such indirect facilitative behaviors may be important in terms of the population processes (e. g., prey consumption and growth rates) of these <b>demersal</b> <b>fishes...</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{demersal}} zone supports {{many animals}} that feed on benthic organisms or seek protection from predators. The seabed provides {{a range of}} habitats on or {{under the surface of}} the substrate which are used by creatures adapted to these conditions. The tidal zone with its periodic exposure to dehydrating air is home to barnacles, molluscs, and crustaceans. The neritic zone has many organisms that need light to flourish. Here, sponges, echinoderms, polychaete worms, sea anemones, and other invertebrates live among algal-encrusted rocks. Corals often contain photosynthetic symbionts and live in shallow waters where light penetrates. The extensive calcareous skeletons they extrude build up into coral reefs which are an important feature of the seabed. These provide a diverse habitat for reef dwelling organisms. There is less sea life on the floor of deeper seas but marine life also flourishes around seamounts that rise from the depths, where fish and other animals congregate to spawn and feed. Close to the seabed live <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> that largely feed on pelagic organisms or benthic invertebrates. Exploration of the deep sea by submersibles revealed a new world of creatures living on the seabed that scientists had not previously expected. Some like the detritivores rely on organic material falling to the ocean floor. Others cluster round deep-sea hydrothermal vents where mineral-rich flows of water emerge, supporting communities whose primary producers are sulphide-oxidizing chemoautotrophic bacteria and whose consumers include specialized bivalves, sea anemones, barnacles, crabs, worms, and fish. A dead whale sinking {{to the bottom of the}} ocean provides food for an assembly of organisms which similarly rely largely on the actions of sulphur-reducing bacteria. Such places support unique biomes where many new microbes and other lifeforms have been discovered.|$|E
25|$|Like coastal <b>demersal</b> <b>fish,</b> {{deep sea}} <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> {{can be divided}} into benthic fish and benthopelagic fish, where the benthic fish are {{negatively}} buoyant and benthopelagic fish are neutrally buoyant.|$|E
25|$|Examples of such {{shallow water}} <b>demersal</b> <b>fish,</b> found in both {{tropical}} and temperate waters around the world, are triplefins, seahorses, wrasse and flounder. As <b>demersal</b> <b>fish,</b> all these fish {{spend most of}} their time on or near the sea floor.|$|E

25|$|Fish {{that live}} on or in close {{association}} with the sea floor are called <b>demersal</b> <b>fish.</b> This section discusses the coastal <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> that live on the continental shelf, but are living further from the coast and in deeper water than the nearshore fish discussed above.|$|E

Increased catch with a proportionate increase of <b>demersal</b> <b>fishes</b> was obtained when compared to a standard bottom trawl of 32 m head rope length with small meshes, suggesting the possibility of increasing the mesh size of trawl nets in the forepart.

25|$|Deep sea <b>{{demersal}}</b> <b>fish</b> {{are usually}} long and narrow. Many are eels or shaped like eels. This {{may be because}} long bodies have long lateral lines. Lateral lines detect low-frequency sounds, and some demersal fishes have muscles that drum such sounds to attract mates.

25|$|<b>Demersal</b> <b>fish</b> can {{be divided}} into two main types: {{strictly}} benthic fish which can rest on the sea floor, and benthopelagic fish which can float in the water column just above the sea floor.|$|E
25|$|Benthopelagic {{fish have}} neutral buoyancy, {{so they can}} float at depth without much effort, while {{strictly}} benthic fish are more dense, with negative buoyancy so they can lie on the bottom without any effort. Most <b>demersal</b> <b>fish</b> are benthopelagic.|$|E
25|$|The {{bodies of}} deep water <b>demersal</b> <b>fishes</b> are muscular with well {{developed}} organs. In this {{way they are}} closer to mesopelagic fishes than bathypelagic fishes.
