5|$|Carbon fiber {{is made by}} {{pyrolysis}} of <b>extruded</b> {{and stretched}} filaments of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) and other organic substances. The crystallographic structure and mechanical properties of the fiber depend {{on the type of}} starting material, and on the subsequent processing. Carbon fibers made from PAN have structure resembling narrow filaments of graphite, but thermal processing may re-order the structure into a continuous rolled sheet. The result is fibers with higher specific tensile strength than steel.|$|E
5|$|Glass fiber {{is formed}} when thin strands of silica-based or other {{formulation}} glass are <b>extruded</b> into many fibers with small diameters suitable for textile processing. The technique of heating and drawing glass into fine fibers {{has been known}} for millennia; however, the use of these fibers for textile applications is more recent. Until this time, all glass fiber had been manufactured as staple (that is, clusters of short lengths of fiber).|$|E
5|$|Many other {{biological}} structures exhibit liquid-crystal behavior. For instance, the concentrated {{protein solution}} that is <b>extruded</b> by a spider to generate silk is, in fact, a liquid crystal phase. The precise ordering of molecules in silk {{is critical to}} its renowned strength. DNA and many polypeptides can also form LC phases and this too forms {{an important part of}} current academic research.|$|E

50|$|In recent years, many {{manufacturers}} {{had already}} developed their technologies of <b>extruding</b> {{and expansion of}} polyolefin backing. In the past, the production process of backing was done by <b>extruding,</b> cross-linking and expansion. However, {{in order to increase}} the production efficiency, some of manufacturers expand the backing during <b>extruding,</b> and then send the backing to e-beam for the cross-linking process.|$|R
5000|$|Cold forming (cold heading): Cold forming {{is similar}} to <b>extruding</b> in that it squeezes the blank {{material}} but cold forming uses the punch and the die to create the desired form, <b>extruding</b> does not.|$|R
5|$|The high melting point, {{hardness}} and {{corrosion resistance}} of iridium and its alloys determine {{most of its}} applications. Iridium and especially iridium–platinum alloys or osmium–iridium alloys have a low wear and are used, for example, for multi-pored spinnerets, through which a plastic polymer melt is <b>extruded</b> to form fibers, such as rayon. Osmium–iridium is used for compass bearings and for balances.|$|E
5|$|Mount Tambora has {{remained}} active {{since the end}} of the 1815 eruption sequence. Minor lava domes and flows were <b>extruded</b> on the caldera floor during the 19th and 20th centuries. Sometime between 1850 and 1910, Tambora erupted again but only inside the caldera. Small lava flows and lava dome extrusions were formed. This eruption (VEI-2) created the Doro Api Toi parasitic cone inside the caldera. A very small (VEI-0) and non-explosive eruption occurred in 1967; Another very small eruption was reported in 2011. In August 2011, the alert level for the volcano was raised from level I to level II after increasing activity was reported in the caldera, including earthquakes and smoke emissions.|$|E
5|$|The {{exoskeleton}} of {{the abdomen}} {{is divided into}} plates called dorsal tergites and ventral sternites. Wax is secreted from glands on the abdomen and <b>extruded</b> between the sternites where it resembles flakes of dandruff. It is secreted by the queen when she starts a nest and by young workers. It is scraped from the abdomen by the legs, moulded until malleable and used {{in the construction of}} honeypots, to cover the eggs, to line empty cocoons for use as storage containers and sometimes to cover the exterior of the nest.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: An {{experimental}} {{program was}} undertaken to <b>extrude</b> a lead alloy on ELECompact- 1500 compression machine. Extrusion variables were <b>extrude</b> diameter (d), die bearing length (h), and included die entrant angle Ө = 90 o. Using experimental values, numerical models were obtained {{to describe the}} relationship between extrusion variables and extrusion pressure and <b>extrude</b> deflection. The numerical models were then used to obtain the response pressure predictions for aluminum alloy. Results of validation tests indicated good correlation between predicted and experimental values. The predictions also compare favorably with values obtained by a similar second-order modified upper bound model frequently used in industry for estimating extrusion loads with prediction errors below 4 %. Surface responses graphs of extrusion pressure and <b>extrude</b> deflection were also used to define the optimized field for interaction of extrusion parameters for minimizing extrusion loads and controlling <b>extrudes</b> deflection or bending. Owing to fewer input variables, the proposed models were considered convenient options for a quick estimate of extrusion loads and product curvature...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{process of}} {{constructing}} breakwater {{project is a}} course of dumping rockfill. And the slit is squeezed out. The simulation of dumping rockfill is mainly by Lagrange or Euler algorithm. But these two algorithms have disadvantages {{in the process of}} simulating. The course of <b>extruding</b> slitl is a dynamic contact process of rockfill, seawater and silt. This paper studies the basic principle of Coupled Euler Lagrange algorithms (CEL). The course of <b>extruding</b> slit is simulated by CEL with ABAQUS. This paper studies the course of <b>extruding</b> slit by dumping rockfill in the project of Haiyang harbor. The size effect of rockfill on <b>extruding</b> depth is put forward. The research results can be used be used for reference in other engineering...|$|R
5|$|The gastrovascular cavity {{itself is}} divided {{into a number of}} {{chambers}} by mesenteries radiating inwards from the body wall. Some of the mesenteries form complete partitions with a free edge {{at the base of the}} pharynx, where they connect, but others reach only partway across. The mesenteries are usually found in multiples of twelve, and are symmetrically arranged around the central lumen. They have stomach lining on both sides, separated by a thin layer of mesoglea, and include filaments of tissue specialised for secreting digestive enzymes. In some species, these filaments extend below the lower margin of the mesentery, hanging free in the gastrovascular cavity as thread-like acontial filaments. These acontia are armed with nematocysts and can be <b>extruded</b> through cinclides, blister-like holes in the wall of the column, for use in defence.|$|E
5|$|The {{recovered}} beef {{material is}} <b>extruded</b> through long tubes that are thinner than a pencil, {{during which time}} at the Beef Products, Inc. (BPI) processing plant, the meat is exposed to gaseous ammonia. At Cargill Meat Solutions, citric acid is used to kill bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella. Gaseous ammonia {{in contact with the}} water in the meat produces ammonium hydroxide. The ammonia sharply increases the pH and damages microscopic organisms, the freezing causes ice crystals to form and puncture the organisms' weakened cell walls, and the mechanical stress destroys the organisms altogether. The product is finely ground, compressed into pellets or blocks, flash frozen and then shipped for use as an additive.|$|E
5|$|The abdomen {{consists}} of ten segments and contains the gut and genital organs. The front eight segments have spiracles and the terminal segment is modified for reproduction. The male has {{a pair of}} clasping organs attached to a ring structure, and during copulation, a tubular structure is <b>extruded</b> and inserted into the female's vagina. A spermatophore is deposited in the female, following which the sperm {{make their way to}} a seminal receptacle where they are stored for later use. In both sexes, the genitalia are adorned with various spines, teeth, scales and bristles, which act to prevent the butterfly from mating with an insect of another species. After it emerges from its pupal stage, a butterfly cannot fly until the wings are unfolded. A newly emerged butterfly needs to spend some time inflating its wings with hemolymph and letting them dry, during which time it is extremely vulnerable to predators.|$|E

5|$|The main {{geological}} {{component of}} the Mendips is Carboniferous Limestone. It represents {{the remnants of a}} much higher range of hills that existed hundreds of millions years ago. This has allowed the formation of features such as Cheddar Gorge, Ebbor Gorge and Burrington Combe. There are a wide variety of caves and swallet holes caused by dissolution of the rock by water. Further east there are Silurian volcanoes, Carboniferous Limestone outcrops, Variscan thrust tectonics, Permo-Triassic conglomerates, sediment-filled fissures, a classic unconformity, Jurassic clays and limestones, Cretaceous Greensand and chalk topped with Tertiary remnants including Sarsen Stones. These sediments have yielded a fairly rich fossil fauna of brachiopods and trilobites indicating that they were deposited in a shallow marine sea into which the lavas were <b>extruded.</b> The rocks are quarried at Moons Hill near Stoke St Michael for aggregate.|$|E
