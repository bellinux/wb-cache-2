Previous studies have concerned with minimizing the cost {{but in this}} model, aim is maximizing auditor’s utility. For this purpose an integer programming model introduced.

Each branch has different <b>impact</b> <b>values</b> for auditors, which indicate auditors’ utility level in terms of location, size and type of branches. Also to keep the balance of auditor’s working days and total gained <b>impact</b> <b>values</b> particular constraints are defined for the integer programming model.

50|$|Impact {{tests are}} used in {{studying}} the toughness of material. A material's toughness is a factor {{of its ability to}} absorb energy during plastic deformation. Brittle materials have low toughness {{as a result of the}} small amount of plastic deformation that they can endure. The <b>impact</b> <b>value</b> of a material can also change with temperature. Generally, at lower temperatures, the impact energy of a material is decreased. The size of the specimen may also affect the value of the Izod impact test because it may allow a different number of imperfections in the material, which can act as stress risers and lower the impact energy.|$|E
50|$|Wheel sensors {{along the}} tracks feel for flat {{spots on the}} train's wheels. Any flat wheel that becomes too {{dangerous}} to travel on (a big flat spot on the train wheel) will be counted as a defect. Typically, these systems utilise accelerometers, strain gauges, fibre optic methods, or the very latest (WIPD) wheel impact phase detector. A wheel impact load detector (WILD) measures impacts, but does not normalise these impact measurements against anything: simply the impact reading. They do not attempt to cater for differences in sprung mass, as they are measuring wheel defect impact rather than impact load. Therefore, the same wheel defect will register a much larger impact when a wagon is loaded, versus when it is empty.A wheel condition monitoring detector monitors {{the condition of the}} wheel independent of sprung mass - independent of load. They do this by subtracting the wheel mass to get the normalised <b>impact</b> <b>value.</b> These systems are therefore typically better at detecting smaller defects with greater resolution.|$|E

When it performed in short bursts to maintain a low temperature, EB irradiation at a dosage of less than 0. 216 MGy increased the <b>impact</b> <b>value</b> of the glass. Because the EB irradiation generated dangling bonds in the silica glass, partial relaxation of residual strain probably occured around these dangling bonds in the network structure. If this relaxation resulted in optimization of the interatomic distance of the silicon–oxygen pairs to minimize the potential energy, it would increase the bonding energy of the network structure. The increased <b>impact</b> <b>value</b> was therefore mainly due to an increase in the bonding energy for the silicon–oxygen atomic pairs in the atomic network structure, {{as well as to the}} relaxation of the network structure.

The study was an applied research adopting a survey method and it was based on survey correlation using questionnaires. The statistical population of this research was students of business management. Simple random sampling method was used and a total valid sample of 224 was collected.

40|$|AIM: This paper {{presents}} {{the evaluation of}} a preceptorship programme for newly-qualified nurses (NQNs) to determine preceptee engagement with the preceptorship programme, and the <b>impact,</b> <b>value</b> and sustainability of the programme from the preceptees' perspectives. BACKGROUND: The literature suggests that NQNs find the transition from student to qualified nurse to be stressful and that preceptorship can reduce this stress and promote adaptation to the new role. SETTING: This study took place in one NHS Healthcare Trust in South West London, UK. PARTICIPANTS: Ninety NQNs {{were invited to participate}} in the study and the response rate was 48. 9 % (n= 44). The study took place in 2011. METHODS: Evaluative research design was used incorporating a fourfold evaluation framework of preceptee engagement, <b>impact,</b> <b>value</b> and sustainability (Ooms et al., 2011). This was a mixed methods study. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected through questionnaires, reflective journals and through personal audio recordings made by the preceptees. Quantitative data were analysed through descriptive statistics and t-tests, and Cronbach's alpha coefficient was used to assess reliability of impact and value scales. In addition analysis of open-ended questions and qualitative data was undertaken using the Framework Method of analysis. FINDINGS: Findings show that preceptee engagement in the programme was high and preceptorship was highly valued by the majority of preceptees (85 %). Preceptors played a positive role in terms of alleviating stress. Preceptorship impacted positively on preceptees in terms of development of communication skills and clinical skills, and role, personal and professional development. In addition, preceptees felt that the programme was of value despite acknowledging difficulties in making time to meet with preceptors. Preceptees also indicated that they would wish to be preceptors in the future and that they would recommend preceptorship to all nurses who are either newly qualified or new in role. Preceptees judged the preceptorship programme positively for engagement, <b>impact,</b> <b>value</b> and sustainability. CONCLUSION: The study is unique when mapped against other research studies as it explores a breadth of evaluative issues not found in other preceptorship studies, e. g. engagement, <b>impact,</b> <b>value</b> and sustainability of preceptorship. The study adds insights about sustainability of preceptorship programmes and expectations of competence of NQNs that do not appear in previous literature about preceptorship...|$|E

Plates of iron- 12 weight percent nickel- 0. 25 weight percent titanium were grain-refined by the four-step, grain-refining thermal treatment developed for this alloy. These plates were then welded with Inconel No. 92 weld wire using the Gas Metal Arc (GMA) welding process with argon- 15 % helium gas shielding. Both a single pass and a double-sided, 2 pass electron beam (EB) weld were also made but without filler metal addition. Weldments were radiographed and sectioned and the Charpy V-notch specimens removed were tested at liquid-nitrogen and -helium temperatures. Radiographically acceptable weld deposits were somewhat difficult to achieve. Only 4 out of 7 GMA welds and 2 out of 4 EB welds were acceptable. The problems encountered during EB welding were largely due to alignment and weld metal fluidity. The automated GMA welds encountered problems due to incomplete fusion, {{the sensitivity of the}} weld metal to oxidization and the production of inclusions rich in titanium. The minimum Charpy V-notch <b>impact</b> <b>values</b> obtained for the heat-affected zones of a radiographically acceptable GMA weld were 50 and 62 ft-lbs (68 and 84 Joules) at liquid helium (4 °K) and liquid nitrogen (- 196 °C) testing temperatures, respectively.
