5|$|The {{bulk of the}} <b>external</b> <b>work</b> was {{complete}} {{by the end of}} 1879. The result closely followed Burges's original plans, with the exception of an additional watch tower intended to resemble a minaret, and some defensive timber hoardings, both of which were not undertaken. Clark continued to advise Burges on historical aspects of the reconstruction and the architect tested the details of proposed features, such as the drawbridge and portcullis, against surviving designs at other British castles.|$|E
25|$|In practice, the Joule–Thomson {{effect is}} {{achieved}} by allowing the gas to expand through a throttling device (usually a valve) which must be very well insulated to prevent any heat transfer to or from the gas. No <b>external</b> <b>work</b> is extracted from the gas during the expansion (the gas must not be expanded through a turbine, for example).|$|E
25|$|Besides the {{canonical}} choral {{celebration of the}} Divine Office, a portion of which was recited at midnight, there were two hours of private prayer daily. The fasts and disciplines were rigorous and frequent. The great <b>external</b> <b>work</b> was preaching and spiritual ministrations among the poor. In theology the Capuchins abandoned the later Franciscan School of Scotus, {{and returned to the}} earlier school of St. Bonaventure.|$|E

25|$|This {{consists}} of a refrigeration cycle, where heat is removed from a low-temperature space or source and rejected to a high-temperature sink {{with the help of}} <b>external</b> <b>work,</b> and its inverse, the thermodynamic power cycle. In the power cycle, heat is supplied from a high-temperature source to the engine, part of the heat being used to produce work and the rest being rejected to a low-temperature sink. This satisfies the second law of thermodynamics.|$|E
25|$|While the {{exchange}} of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the bloodstream and the pulmonary airspace works by diffusion and requires no <b>external</b> <b>work,</b> air must be moved {{into and out of}} the lungs to make it available to the gas exchange process. In spontaneous breathing, a negative pressure is created in the pleural cavity by the muscles of respiration, and the resulting gradient between the atmospheric pressure and the pressure inside the thorax generates a flow of air.|$|E

50|$|The {{development}} of the stadium was part of three subsites which also included a 3,400-space carpark which cost A$25 million, and a plaza with <b>external</b> <b>works,</b> also costing $25 million. The roof's masts reach 42 m above ground level, and the stadium occupies a site of 20000 m2.|$|R
25|$|Energy is {{associated}} with gravitational fields. A stationary body far from another can do <b>external</b> <b>work</b> if it is pulled towards it, and therefore has gravitational potential energy. Since work is required to separate two bodies against the pull of gravity, their gravitational potential energy increases as they are separated, and decreases as they approach one another. For point masses the gravitational energy decreases to zero as they approach zero separation. It is convenient and conventional to assign the potential energy as having zero value when they are an infinite distance apart, and hence it has a negative value (since it decreases from zero) for smaller finite distances.|$|E
500|$|The castle was {{purchased}} by Count Robin Mirrlees in 1962 or 1963. Renovation work was possibly undertaken in 1965 by architect Oliver Hill, although his undated drawings {{may not have been}} fully implemented. [...] After visiting the property in 1966, Nigel Tranter, author and historian, reported that work had begun on the structure but described it as a [...] "ruinous shell of a house". Some structural restoration work was undertaken and the castle was slightly repaired, sufficient to have made it [...] "wind and watertight" [...] by 1971. But it was then abandoned again, and further deterioration occurred; it had been uninhabitable since 1836, and Mirlees never lived in it. Internally, only basic work was undertaken. Local residents believed the only time the interior was used during this period was when a ceremony was held to site a plaque commemorating the completion of <b>external</b> <b>work</b> in 1971.|$|E
500|$|Plans {{submitted}} in 2005 for {{the restoration}} of the building were approved by Liverpool City Council. The scheme involved major internal and <b>external</b> <b>work</b> that would fully restore the Grade II* listed building. The plans included opening the building to the public, by creating a new viewing floor inside the dome and a publicly accessible sunken piazza on the riverside frontage that would provide a small parade of restaurants, cafes and shops. A sixth level of the building, which had been [...] "dismantled" [...] {{in the aftermath of the}} Second World War, was also to be restored, providing a series of luxury apartments. The first stage of the renovation was completed in early 2008, when the restoration of the Portland stone on the river facing side of the building was completed. The £10m restoration project was fully completed in early 2009, when the last scaffolding was removed from the outside of the building and [...] of refurbished office space was completed.|$|E
50|$|The palace is {{believed}} to be completed in the late eighteenth century. Additional construction such as the upper storey was added in the late 18th century.

Internal work included new timber stairs, toilets and a theatrette. New ceiling cornices and ceiling roses were installed to match the period and the existing.|$|E
2500|$|The main public {{buildings}} in Sydney, completed from the 1850s until the 20th century {{were built in}} sandstone from Pyrmont where some 50 quarries operated.

Many of Sydney's early sandstone buildings remain but many have been demolished. Demolished buildings include: Vickery's Warehouse, Pitt Street; Robert C.

60|$|September 28th.--8---- and I {{walked to}} Charing Cross {{yesterday}} forenoon, and there took a Hansom cab to St. Paul's Cathedral. It {{had been a}} thick, foggy morning, but had warmed and brightened {{into one of the}} balmiest and sunniest of noons. As we entered the cathedral, the long bars of sunshine were falling from its upper windows through the great interior atmosphere, and were made visible by the dust, or mist, floating about in it. It is a grand edifice, and I liked it quite as much as on my first view of it, although a sense of coldness and nakedness is felt when we compare it with Gothic churches. It is more an <b>external</b> <b>work</b> than the Gothic churches are, and is not so made out of the dim, awful, mysterious, grotesque, intricate nature of man. But it is beautiful and grand. I love its remote distances, and wide, clear spaces, its airy massiveness; its noble arches, its sky-like dome, which, I think, should be all over light, with ground-glass, instead of being dark, with only diminutive windows.|$|E
60|$|Passing the Swanzy establishment, a model board-house, with masonry posts, a {{verandah}} all round, and {{a flying}} roof of corrugated iron, we ascend the old paved ramp. Here we remark that the castle-gateway of the Dutch, {{leading to the}} outer or slave court, {{has been replaced by}} a mean hole in the wall. The <b>external</b> <b>work</b> was demolished, lest the enemy effect a lodgement there. We can walk seawards round the green knob scattered with black boulders, and pick an excellent salad, a kind of African dandelion, which the carnivorous English miners called 'grass,'--with a big, big D. Entering the hole in the wall, and passing through a solid arched gateway and across a small court upon which the prison opens, we ascend the steps leading to the upper work. This is a large square house, pierced in front for one door and three windows, and connected by a bridge, formerly a drawbridge, with the two tall belvideres, once towers guarding the eastern entrance. The body is occupied by the palaver-hall of the opper koopman (chief factor), now converted into a court-house and a small armoury of sniders. It leads to the bedrooms, disposed on three sides. The materials are trap, quartz, probably gold-bearing, and fine bricks, evidently home-made. The substantial quarters fronting the sea are breezy, comfortable, and healthy; and the large cistern contains the only good drinking-water in Axim. Life must be somewhat dull here, but, after all, not so bad as in many an out-station of British India. The chief grievance is that the inmates, the District-commissioner and his medico, are mere birds of passage; they are ordered off and exchanged, at the will of head-quarters, often before they can settle down, and always before they learn to take interest in the place. The works consist of two bastions on the land side; a large one to the south-east, and a smaller to the north-east. Seawards projects a rounded cavalier, fronted by dead ground, or rather water. In the days of the Dutch the platforms carried '22 iron guns, besides some patteraroes.' Now there are two old bronze guns, two 'chambeis' bearing the mark 'La Hague,' and an ancient iron tube dismounted: a seven-pounder mountain-gun, of a type now obsolete, lurks in the shadows of the arched gateway. I afterwards had an opportunity of seeing the ammunition, and was much struck by a tub of black mud, which they told me was gunpowder. The Ashantis at least keep theirs dry.|$|E
