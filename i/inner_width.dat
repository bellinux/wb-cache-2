To measure these velocity dispersions, we use 13 CO, C 18 O, and N 2 H+ line observations obtained with the IRAM 30 m telescope. Correlating our velocity dispersion measurements with the filament column densities derived from Herschel data, we show that interstellar filaments can be divided into two regimes: thermally subcritical filaments, which have transonic velocity dispersions (c_s < σ_tot < 2 c_s) independent of column density, and are gravitationally unbound; and thermally supercritical filaments, which have higher velocity dispersions scaling roughly as the square root of column density (σ_tot Σ^ 0. 5), and are self-gravitating. The higher velocity dispersions of supercritical filaments may not directly arise from supersonic interstellar turbulence but may be driven by gravitational contraction/accretion. Based on our observational results, we propose an evolutionary scenario whereby supercritical filaments undergo gravitational contraction and increase in mass per unit length through accretion of background material while remaining in rough virial balance.

40|$|Context. Herschel {{observations}} of nearby molecular clouds suggest that interstellar filaments and prestellar cores represent two fundamental {{steps in the}} star formation process. The observations support a picture of low-mass star formation according to which filaments of 0. 1 pc width form first in the cold interstellar medium, probably {{as a result of}} large-scale compression of interstellar matter by supersonic turbulent flows, and then prestellar cores arise from gravitational fragmentation of the densest filaments. Whether this scenario also applies to regions of high-mass star formation is an open question, in part because the resolution of Herschel is insufficient to resolve the <b>inner</b> <b>width</b> of filaments in the nearest regions of massive star formation. Aims. In an effort to characterize the <b>inner</b> <b>width</b> of filaments in high-mass star-forming regions, we imaged {{the central part of the}} NGC 6334 complex at a resolution higher by a factor of > 3 than Herschel at 350 μm. Methods. We used the large-format bolometer camera ArTéMiS on the APEX telescope and combined the high-resolution ArTéMiS data at 350 μm with Herschel/HOBYS data at 70 – 500 μm to ensure good sensitivity to a broad range of spatial scales. This allowed us to study the structure of the main narrow filament of the complex with a resolution of 8 ″ or < 0. 07 pc at d 1. 7 kpc. Results. Our study confirms that this filament is a very dense, massive linear structure with a line mass ranging from 500 M⊙/pc to 2000 M⊙/pc over nearly 10 pc. It also demonstrates for the first time that its <b>inner</b> <b>width</b> remains as narrow as W 0. 15 ± 0. 05 pc all along the filament length, within a factor of < 2 of the characteristic 0. 1 pc value found with Herschel for lower-mass filaments in the Gould Belt.
