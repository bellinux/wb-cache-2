The perceived high cost premium of SFRs over LWRs has been the primary impediment to the commercial expansion of SFR technologies. In this paper, cost reduction options are discussed for advanced SFR designs.

The design options for the fully passive decay heat removal systems are also thoroughly examined.

5000|$|A 15 MWe <b>demonstration</b> <b>reactor,</b> Arbeitsgemeinschaft Versuchsreaktor (AVR {{translates}} to experimental reactor consortium), was {{built at the}} Jülich Research Centre in Jülich, West Germany. The goal was to gain operational experience with a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor. The unit's first criticality was on August 26, 1966. The facility ran successfully for 21 years, and was decommissioned on December 1, 1988, {{in the wake of}} the Chernobyl disaster and operational problems. During removal of the fuel elements it became obvious that the neutron reflector under the pebble-bed core had cracked during operation. Some hundred fuel elements remained stuck in the crack. During this examination it became also obvious that the AVR is the most heavily beta-contaminated (strontium-90) nuclear installation worldwide and that this contamination is present in the worst form, as dust. [...] In 1978, the AVR suffered from a water/steam ingress accident of 30 metric tons, which led to contamination of soil and groundwater by strontium-90 and by tritium. The leak in the steam generator, leading to this accident, was probably caused by too high core temperatures (see criticism section). A re-examination of this accident was announced by the local government in July, 2010.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSteady-state {{operation}} of a fusion power plant requires external current drive to minimize the power requirements, and a high fraction of bootstrap current is required.

Two plasma scenarios pertaining to two different <b>demonstration</b> <b>reactor</b> options, known as pulsed (Option 1) and steady-state (Option 2) models, have been analyzed.

40|$|Hydrogen {{explosion}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} dangerous accident phenomena in both nuclear fusion and fission reactor. In the typical fusion reactor, tritium and deuterium are fuel elements for fusion reaction, and they exist in condensed state around the cryo-pump in the normal operation condition. In the accident situation, increasing heat transfer system temperature can mobilize lots of tritium in the vacuum vessel. And then, coolant can react with high-temperature structures generating hydrogen gas inside vacuum vessel. In addition, air ingress into plasma terminates fusion reaction producing activated dust on the first wall plasma facing surfaces. Through these series of process, mobilized tritium and dust aerosol can explode in the vacuum vessel and damage the containment building integrity, making a sort of source term leakage to environment through various system volumes. In this paper, preliminary safety analysis for hydrogen and dust explosion accident for assumed design of Korean fusion <b>demonstration</b> <b>reactor</b> is conducted. An MELCOR system analysis code is used to simulate this accident and parametric analysis to investigate effect on the accident scale and safety systems like detritiation system such as heating, ventilation, and air conditioning isolation system and pressure suppression system. As a result, aerosol distribution of each control volume and its release route are estimated, and final aerosol release to the environment is compared with release guideline for ITER.

40|$|This {{analysis}} {{focuses on}} identifying the intrinsic {{strengths and weaknesses}} of the (Very) High Temperature Reactor – HTR – at the latest state of the technology. The potential opportunities offered by the future HTR market and the factors and threats that limit its deployment are also analysed. The HTR has been under study in the nuclear sector since the 1960 ’s mainly in the USA and the EU (Germany) and more recently in South Africa and China; in fact, <b>demonstration</b> <b>reactors</b> up to 300 MWe have been built and have operated for several years. However, when they were built, the market reality did not really match up well with the strengths and potential of the HTR, and other reactor technologies won the favour of the nuclear energy market and took advantage of the opportunities offered by it. There are several reasons why the HTR, despite showing high potential for electricity production and co-generation (non electric applications), has been unable to share the market with other reactor technologies although some of them may no longer be valid. These and other reasons should be analysed, taking into consideration the current market situation and envisaging future energy market demands and trends from a realistic perspective [...] This paper focuses on an HTR SWOT analysis based on the available public information summarized in the SWOT matrix and workout considerations.

40|$|Abstract. As {{the physics}} of a burning plasma are coming closer to being {{demonstrated}} in ITER, the focus of fusion research will shift towards the technology needed to build a <b>demonstration</b> <b>reactor.</b> The EU supports the development of its reference breeding blankets mainly within its long-term breeding blanket and materials R&D programmes. The recent European Power Plant Conceptual Study (PPCS) points out that a plant based on Helium-cooled in-vessel components, i. e. breeding blanket and divertor, while assuming limited technological extrapolation, {{has the potential for}} producing electricity in a competitive future market. While this outcome is based on careful analysis of key functions of the in-vessel components, the complexity of the task has prevented a comprehensive design of a blanket/divertor system fully integrated within the reactor vessel of a tokamak fusion machine. The paper presents the current status of a study of design concepts available for reactor integration, based on the recent development in Europe of blankets and divertors, and focussing on the EU modular Helium cooled pebble bed (HCPB) blanket concept. As a geometry relevant for a <b>demonstration</b> <b>reactor,</b> a reactor model of 3300 MW fusion power is assumed. Conceptual design solutions are proposed for (i) blanket segmentation; (ii) curved blanket modules covering the tokamak surface; (iii) replacable shield modules; in-vessel piping including compensation for differential thermal expansion; and, (iv) attachment and remote handling schemes for blanket and shield. The requirements imposed by in-vessel integration have implications on blanket performance, since they affect blanket coverage, the amount of structural steel required, and radial space requirements. The work provides important feedback especially on current breeding blanket design, and input for the definition of a future European DEMO study...|$|E
