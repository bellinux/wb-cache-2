He mentions the recommendations of other physicians, Diagoras (according to Eristratus), Andreas, and Mnesidemus, only to dismiss them as false and not borne out by experience. He ends with a <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> the liquid is gathered from poppy plants, and lists names used for it: chamaesyce, mecon rhoeas, oxytonon; papaver to the Romans, and wanti to the Egyptians.|$|E
5|$|Unfinished Tales also {{contains}} various drafts {{not included in}} The Lord of the Rings that describe Saruman's attempts to frustrate Sauron's chief servants, the Nazgûl, {{in their search for}} the Ring during the early part of The Fellowship of the Ring; in one version he considers throwing himself on Gandalf's mercy. There is also a <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> Saruman becomes involved with the Shire and of how he gradually becomes jealous of Gandalf. Another brief account describes how the five Istari were chosen by the Valar for their mission.|$|E
5|$|The Fox terrier and Jack Russell terrier type dogs {{of today}} are all descended from dogs of that period, {{although}} documented pedigrees earlier than 1862 {{have not been}} found, although several records remain of documented breeding by John Russell between the 1860s and 1880s. The Fox Terrier Club was formed in 1875 with Russell {{as one of the}} founder members; its breed standard was aspiration, and not a <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> the breed appeared then. By the start of the 20th century, the Fox terrier had altered more towards the modern breed, but {{in some parts of the}} country the old style of John Russell's terriers remained, and it is from those dogs that the modern Jack Russell type has descended.|$|E

5|$|The {{text on the}} Cylinder praises Cyrus, {{sets out}} his {{genealogy}} and portrays him as a king from a line of kings. The Babylonian king Nabonidus, who was defeated and deposed by Cyrus, is denounced as an impious oppressor {{of the people of}} Babylonia and his low-born origins are implicitly contrasted to Cyrus' kingly heritage. The victorious Cyrus is portrayed as having been chosen by the chief Babylonian god Marduk to restore peace and order to the Babylonians. The text states that Cyrus was welcomed by the people of Babylon as their new ruler and entered the city in peace. It appeals to Marduk to protect and help Cyrus and his son Cambyses. It extols Cyrus as a benefactor of the citizens of Babylonia who improved their lives, repatriated displaced people and restored temples and cult sanctuaries across Mesopotamia and elsewhere in the region. It concludes with a <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> Cyrus repaired the city wall of Babylon and found a similar inscription placed there by an earlier king.|$|E
5|$|This Case further {{represented}} {{the development of}} the incandescent electric light bulb from the fundamental steps shown in Case #1. These electric lamps were from worldwide inventors that worked directly with Edison on ideas. The electric light bulbs were grouped chronologically from 1881 to 1904. Among these were some Diehl's induction lamps for use with alternating current. A <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> this technology worked is that of a secondary coil of wire was placed inside the bulb of a vacuum. The two ends of the coiled wire connected to the filament that was electrified and provided the light. A primary coil was wound {{on the outside of the}} glass bulb. This coil was connected to an alternating current electrical power supply. The secondary coil inside the bulb would receive this alternating magnetism from the primary coil and provide an electrical current that electrified the inside filament. Ultimately this type of alternating current technology never developed and was not used. Pictures of some of the lamps that were in this display are below. These were later numbered 358 to 536.|$|E
