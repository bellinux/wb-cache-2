25|$|By {{producing}} the bulk concentrate, the total recovery of zinc for sale was maintained at over 70% until 1989. However, the high lead content {{meant that the}} bulk concentrate could not be treated by the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>zinc</b> process, {{and it had to}} be sold to zinc smelters using the more-expensive Imperial Smelting Process. Initially, MIM received good revenue from its bulk concentrate, but as the nature of the ore continued to deteriorate, the production of the bulk concentrate increased and saturated the market. Payment terms declined until MIM received less than half the payment for zinc in the bulk concentrate than it received for zinc in the zinc concentrate.|$|E
50|$|The {{striking}} {{method is}} also used {{in combination with the}} plating of different metals. If it is desirable to plate one type of deposit onto a metal to improve corrosion resistance but this metal has inherently poor adhesion to the substrate, a strike can be first deposited that is compatible with both.

5000|$|The {{privately owned}} Tasmanian Hydro-Electric and Metallurgical Co. Ltd. first took a serious {{interest}} in generating hydro-electric power {{from one of}} Tasmania's highland rivers in late 1909, to provide power for James Gillies' newly patented <b>electrolytic</b> process for <b>zinc</b> refining, and a [...] "carbide" [...] smelter to be constructed near Snug. They resolved to construct a hydro-electric power plant in {{the valley of the}} Ouse River, above the town that bears that name. Water was to be provided by a small dam on the great lake at Miena, which would then divert water down the steep drop using a woodstave pipeline and a flume. Construction began in earnest in 1910.|$|R
40|$|<b>Electrolytic</b> {{recovery}} of <b>zinc</b> (Zn) from aqueous solutions is an energy intensive process carried out using highly concentrated Zn 2 + solutions. To reduce the energy consumption and make Zn recovery possible from dilute waste streams, a more energy-efficient process is needed. In this study, we tested a microbial electrolysis cells for Zn recovery from acidic solutions. The reactors contained biological anodes that generated current by oxidizing acetate. The reactors were operated with either controlled anode potential or controlled cathode potential. During operation with controlled anode operation, the energy efficiency for Zn recovery was highly variable and {{depended on the}} biologically generated current and the Zn 2 + concentration in the catholyte. During operation with controlled cathode potential, a relatively stable energy consumption of 0. 59 – 0. 72 kWh kg− 1 Zn was obtained. This was about three times lower than the energy consumption for Zn recovery under abiotic conditions...|$|R

In 1914, Montana Power considered raising the height of Black Eagle Dam to increase its power generation capacity. In 1916, much of the Boston and Montana smelter plant {{was replaced by a}} modern copper and zinc smelter, and a wire and cable manufacturing plant was added. But Black Eagle Dam, even with upgrades to its turbines and other power generation equipment, still only generated about three MW of electricity. More power was required. By the early 1920s, the needs of the city of Great Falls had outstripped Black Eagle Dam's ability to generate electricity, and the smelter was planning a new <b>electrolytic</b> <b>zinc</b> manufacturing plant that would require 10 MW of power. By 1925, the north powerhouses were seriously outdated.|$|E

40|$|In the <b>electrolytic</b> {{production}} of <b>zinc,</b> cobalt {{is removed from}} zinc electrolyte by cementation with zinc dust Prior to electrowinning. Although the thermodynamics for this reaction are favourable, kinetic barriers to cobalt reduction render the method impractical unless activators such as antimony or arsenic in conjunction with copper are used. There is {{a large body of}} work studying the effect of these additives, yet the mechanism by which they act is still poorly understood. Moreover, regardless of the beneficial effect of the activators, from time to time the process fails to meet the target level of 0. 1 mg/L cobalt in the purified electrolyte, with negative consequences in the electrowinning operation. Even when the target conditions are met, zinc dust consumption is excessively high: satisfactory operation requires up to 300 times the stoichiometric amount of zinc dust. In the present work the role of the antimony/copper activators was investigated in a batch cementation process using synthetic electrolyte. The objectives were to study the fundamentals of cobalt cementation in zinc sulfate electrolyte with conventional additives, to clarify the action of additives and their role in cementation, and to identify and test novel additives.

40|$|The mineral-processing {{industry}} {{was a significant}} contributor to the Belgian economy in 2001. The refining of copper, zinc, and minor metals {{and the production of}} steel, all from imported materials, were the largest mineral industries in Belgium. The extraction and recovery of nonferrous metals were carried out in large-scale, high-technology plants. Europe’s largest <b>electrolytic</b> copper and <b>zinc</b> refineries were in Belgium as was one of the continent’s largest lead refineries. The country was also a significant producer of cadmium, germanium, selenium, and tellurium as byproducts from smelting and refining operations. Although the country is small, Belgium has a significant industrial minerals sector. The country was an important producer of such industrial materials as carbonates, which included limestone, dolomite, silica sand, and construction materials, which included a wide range of different types of marble. Environmental programs and policy in Belgium were the responsibility of the Federal Ministry of the Environment as well as its comparable ministries in Flanders and Wallonia, which are two separate regions of the country. Environmental programs ranged from treating oil effluent to reducing air pollution emissions. Belgium was a major exporting country with a highly developed market economy and, in 2000 (latest year for which data are available), was ranked as the 12 th largest trading nation in {{the world in terms of}} exports and imports, each equivalent to about 75 % of gross national product; this made the country one of the highest per capita exporters in the world.

50|$|At {{the same}} time, the mineral grain {{size of the}} lead-zinc ore mined and {{processed}} at Mount Isa was decreasing, making it harder to separate the lead and zinc minerals. The liberation of sphalerite (zinc sulfide) grains dropped from over 70% to just over 50% between 1984 and 1991. As a result, the Mount Isa lead-zinc concentrator was forced to produce a bulk concentrate {{from the beginning of}} 1986 until late 1996. Bulk concentrates cannot be treated in <b>electrolytic</b> <b>zinc</b> smelters, due to their lead content, and are typically treated in blast furnaces using the Imperial Smelting Process. The Imperial Smelting Process has higher operating costs than the more common <b>electrolytic</b> <b>zinc</b> process, and therefore the payment received by producers of bulk concentrate is lower than that received for separate lead and zinc concentrates. The zinc in the Mount Isa bulk concentrate was eventually worth less than half that of the zinc in the zinc concentrate.|$|E
50|$|Towards {{the end of}} his {{political}} career, Baillieu began {{to take advantage of the}} need for lead and zinc that had been made clear as a result of World War I. Following up on his involvement in the 1905 founding of Zinc Corporation Ltd. at the Broken Hill Ore Deposit in New South Wales, Baillieu worked with W.S. Robinson and Sir Colin Fraser to reorganise the Broken Hill Associated Smelters at Port Pirie and brought about the formation and development of the <b>Electrolytic</b> <b>Zinc</b> Company in Risdon, Tasmania. As a result of this work, he was awarded (jointly with Robinson) the gold medal of the Institution of Mining and Metallurgy. At the time of his retirement in 1930, Baillieu was a director of the Herald and Weekly Times, the <b>Electrolytic</b> <b>Zinc,</b> the Dunlop Rubber Company and Carlton and United Breweries.
