40|$|While {{there is}} {{evidence}} that feedback projections from cortical and neuromodulatory structures to the olfactory bulb are crucial for maintaining the oscillatory dynamics of olfactory bulb processing, {{it is not clear how}} changes in dynamics are related to odor perception. Using electrical lesions of the olfactory peduncle, sparing output from the olfactory bulb while decreasing <b>feedback</b> <b>inputs</b> to the olfactory bulb, we demonstrate here a role for <b>feedback</b> <b>inputs</b> to the olfactory bulb in the formation of odor–reward associations, but not for maintaining primary bulbar odor representations, as reflected by spontaneous odor discrimination.

40|$|Perceptual {{learning}} {{has been used}} to probe the mechanisms of cortical plasticity in the adult brain. Feedback projections are ubiquitous in the cortex, but little is known about their role in cortical plasticity. Here we explore the hypothesis that learning visual orientation discrimination involves learning-dependent plasticity of top-down <b>feedback</b> <b>inputs</b> from higher cortical areas, serving a different function from plasticity due to changes in recurrent connections within a cortical area. In a Hodgkin-Huxley-based spiking neural network model of visual cortex, we show that modulation of <b>feedback</b> <b>inputs</b> to V 1 from higher cortical areas results in shunting inhibition in V 1 neurons, which changes the response properties of V 1 neurons. The orientation selectivity of V 1 neurons is enhanced without changing orientation preference, preserving the topographic organizations in V 1. These results provide new insights to the mechanisms of plasticity in the adult brain, reconciling apparently inconsistent experiments and providing a new hypothesis for a functional role of the feedbac...|$|R

Therefore we aim benefits to apply this telerobotics background to develop surgical robotics systems. The development of a new input device calls first for a precise understanding of the application requirements. A complete bibliographic study as well as specific experiments were therefore undertaken to understand both the operators manipulative abilities (amplitude of movements, forces, bandwidth, …) and the requirements of the tasks to be done (workspace, environment’s behaviour, …).

40|$|In {{order to}} deal with a large amount of {{information}} carried by visual inputs entering the brain at any given point in time, the brain swiftly uses the same inputs to enhance processing in one part of visual field {{at the expense of the}} others. These processes, collectively called bottom-up attentional selection, are assumed to solely rely on feedforward processing of the external inputs, as it is implied by the nomenclature. Nevertheless, evidence from recent experimental and modeling studies points to the role of feedback in bottom-up attention. Here, we review behavioral and neural evidence that <b>feedback</b> <b>inputs</b> are important for the formation of signals that could guide attentional selection based on exogenous inputs. Moreover, we review results from a modeling study elucidating mechanisms underlying the emergence of these signals in successive layers of neural populations and how they depend on feedback from higher visual areas. We use these results to interpret and discuss more recent findings that can further unravel feedforward and feedback neural mechanisms underlying bottom-up attention. We argue that while it is descriptively useful to separate feedforward and feedback processes underlying bottom-up attention, these processes cannot be mechanistically separated into two successive stages as they occur at almost the same time and affect neural activity within the same brain areas using similar neural mechanisms. Therefore, understanding the interaction and integration of feedforward and <b>feedback</b> <b>inputs</b> is crucial for better understanding of bottom-up attention...|$|R
30|$|DCM {{provides}} {{a wide range}} of powerful clock management features: Clock De-Skew, Frequency Synthesis, Phase Shifting and General Control Signals. The DCM contains a delay-locked loop (DLL) that can completely eliminate clock distribution delays, hence deskewing the DCM’s output clocks with respect to the input clock. The DLL contains delay elements (individual small buffers) and control logic. The control logic contains a phase detector and a delay line selector. The phase detector compares the incoming clock signal (CLKIN) against a <b>feedback</b> <b>input</b> (CLKFB) and steers the delay line selector, essentially adding delay to the output of DCM until the CLKIN and CLKFB coincide.|$|E

40|$|The {{inferior}} olivary nucleus (IO) {{forms the}} gateway to the cerebellar cortex and receives feedback information from the cerebellar nuclei (CN), thereby occupying a central position in the olivo-cerebellar loop. Here, we investigated the <b>feedback</b> <b>input</b> from the CN to the IO in vivo in mice using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. This approach allows us to study how the CN-feedback input is integrated with the activity of olivary neurons, while the olivo-cerebellar system and its connections are intact. Our results show how IO neurons respond to CN stimulation sequentially with: i) a short depolarization (EPSP), ii) a hyperpolarization (IPSP) and iii) a rebound depolarization. The latter two phenomena can also be evoked without the EPSPs. The IPSP is sensitive to a GABA(A) receptor blocker. The IPSP suppresses suprathreshold and subthreshold activity and is generated mainly by activation of the GABA(A) receptors. The rebound depolarization re-initiates and temporarily phase locks the subthreshold oscillations. Lack of electrotonical coupling {{does not affect the}} IPSP of individual olivary neurons, nor the sensitivity of its GABA(A) receptors to blockers. The GABAergic <b>feedback</b> <b>input</b> from the CN does not only temporarily block the transmission of signals through the IO, it also isolates neurons from the network by shunting the junction current and re-initiates the temporal pattern after a fixed time point. These data suggest that the IO not only functions as a cerebellar controlled gating device, but also operates as a pattern generator for controlling motor timing and/or learning...|$|E
