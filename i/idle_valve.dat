50|$|At <b>idle,</b> <b>valve</b> overlap is {{eliminated}} to stabilize combustion.|$|E
50|$|This is {{the default}} pre-loaded code from Bowling and Grippo. It {{is a simple}} and {{effective}} fuel injection controller with an 8x8 fuel table for speed density or alpha-n. Narrow band or wide band oxygen sensors {{can be used for}} closed loop control, and an on/off <b>idle</b> <b>valve</b> may be used.|$|E
50|$|This is {{the default}} Al Grippo code {{that you can}} load onto your MS-II board. The code has (multiple) 12x12 fuel and spark tables, stepper IAC control, PWM <b>idle</b> <b>valve</b> control, several user-configurable spare ports (for things like boost control, water injection, fan control, etc.), self-tuning {{functions}} (Automatic Mixture Control - AMC), and fuel control to 1 µs (100 times more resolution than MegaSquirt-I). MS-II can control distributors or EDIS ignitions and decode many standard toothed crank wheels. Additional features includes X-Tau transient enrichment compensation (acceleration enrichment), nitrous control with fuel and spark adjustments, enhanced closed-loop mixture control w/ wide band sensor AFR targeting, two types of rev-limiting, MAP/MAF/alpha-N fuel control, injector test mode, flex fuel (gasoline/E85) with appropriate sensor, and many more.|$|E
50|$|Additional {{functions}} of the ECM include operation of the fuel pump by closing the Ground for the fuel pump relay, and control of idle speed by a throttle plate bypass <b>valve.</b> The <b>Idle</b> Air Control <b>Valve</b> (IACV) (previously known as an <b>Idle</b> Air Stabiliser <b>Valve</b> - IASV), receives a changing milliamp signal that varies the strength of an electromagnet pulling open the bypass valve.|$|R
50|$|Engine changes {{included}} PGM-FI (Programmed Fuel Injection), IACV (<b>Idle</b> Air Control <b>Valve),</b> {{which operates}} with the FI system, and HECS3 oxygen sensor {{to comply with}} EURO-3 regulations.|$|R
50|$|The {{catalytic}} converter, {{which on}} the PH1 172 had been dual barrel {{was reduced to}} a single barrel and featured 2 lambda sensors, one before and one after the catalytic converter. The biggest change to the PH2 172 over the PH1 was the introduction of an electric throttle. This meant the <b>Idle</b> Control <b>Valve</b> of the PH1 was no longer required leading to a minor redesign of the intake manifold.|$|R
50|$|This is {{the default}} MS3 code {{that you can}} load onto your MS-III board. The code has (multiple) 16x16 fuel and spark tables, support for up to V8 {{sequential}} fuel and spark, stepper IAC control, 2 or 3 wire PWM <b>idle</b> <b>valve</b> control, fuel control to 1 µs, several user-configurable spare ports, specific features for boost control, water injection, fan control, nitrous control etc., MS-III can control distributors or EDIS ignitions and decode {{a wide range of}} OEM toothed crank and cam wheels. Additional features includes enhanced transient enrichment compensation (acceleration enrichment), enhanced closed-loop mixture control with wide band sensor AFR targeting, closed loop idle control, various types of rev-limiting, MAP/MAF/alpha-N fuel control, injector and coil test mode, crank/cam input diagnostics, SDcard datalogging, flex fuel (gasoline/E85) with appropriate sensor, LPG support, and many more.|$|E
40|$|Engine {{control by}} ECU (Electronic Control Unit) can be shortly {{described}} by informations coming from sensors {{sent to the}} ECU, and by calculated and setting values sent to actuators by the ECU. This paper describes idle regulations observations on an engine simulator. The observation of specific idle driving strategies is especially performed by using an ECU which drives an <b>idle</b> <b>valve</b> based on stepper motor linear actuator. Various sub-models like starting models or road models allow idle pintle motion patterns to be generated, showing idle control strategies and calibrations.

50|$|An {{idle air}} control {{actuator}} or <b>idle</b> air control <b>valve</b> (IAC actuator/valve) is a device commonly used in fuel-injected vehicles to control the engine's idling RPM. In carburetted vehicles a similar device known as an idle speed control actuator is used.|$|R
5000|$|Throttle bodies {{may also}} contain valves and {{adjustments}} {{to control the}} minimum airflow during idle. Even in those units that are not [...] "drive-by-wire", there will often be a small solenoid driven <b>valve,</b> the <b>Idle</b> Air Control <b>Valve</b> (IACV), that the ECU uses to control the amount of air that can bypass the main throttle opening to allow the engine to idle when the throttle is closed.|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- OBD-II {{provides}} {{additional information}} to engineer for diagnosis and repair of emissions related problems. OBD-II, standardizes {{on the amount}} of memory (Freeze Frame) it uses to store the readings of the vehicle sensor when it logs on emission related Intermittent Trouble code (IT). The intent of OBD-II, systems is to detect most vehicle malfunctions when performance of a power train component or system deteriorates {{to the point that the}} vehicle’s HC emission exceed standard. The vehicle operator is notified at the time when the vehicle begins to marginally exceed emission standards, by illuminating the Malfunctions Indicator Light (MIL).

5000|$|Air was {{provided}} {{from the air}} filter intake to the intake manifold by a Holley-designed, aluminum, twin-venturi, mechanically actuated throttle body, which was bolted atop the intake manifold. Each venturi was progressively bored and had a diameter of 50mm. To this unit were mounted the Throttle Position Sensor (TPS), Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) sensor and Idle Air Control (IAC) valve (initially {{referred to as the}} [...] "AIS Motor"). A steel cable connected the accelerator pedal inside the vehicle to a mechanical linkage {{at the side of the}} throttle body, which acted to open the air intake butterfly valves inside the venturis. During <b>idle</b> these butterfly <b>valves</b> were closed, so a bypass port and the IAC valve were used to control the intake of air.|$|R
5000|$|... 2008: The CB400SF Hyper VTEC Revo {{introduced}} Honda's PGM-FI programmed {{fuel injection}} and an <b>idle</b> air control <b>valve</b> for improved fuel economy and reliability. Revised engine materials and an integrated crank-case cover reduced the engine weight by 2 kg. The VTEC operation was further refined such that in gears 1-5 four-valve operation engaged at 6,300 rpm for wide open throttle, otherwise at 6,750 rpm, and remaining at 6,750 rpm in 6th gear. Independent cylinder ignition timing map, revised air intake geometry {{and a larger}} stainless steel muffler contribute to fuel efficiency. Updated frame rigidity and engine mounting position improved handling. Optional combined ABS uses three-piston sliding calipers on the front brakes instead of the standard four-piston opposed calipers and a larger 256 mm rear brake disc. Overall weight increased by 4 kg, and 9 kg with ABS.|$|R
50|$|In {{most modern}} installations, an {{electronic}} device called a tachometric relay or safety switch {{is used to}} operate electrical shut-off solenoids. These work by sensing that the engine is running by detecting ignition pulses. Some systems use an engine oil pressure sensor instead. In all installations, there is a filterlock (consisting of a filter assembly and a vacuum or electric solenoid operated shut-off valve) located at the input to the converter. In European converters, {{there is also a}} solenoid in the converter to shut off the <b>idle</b> circuit. These <b>valves</b> are usually both connected to the output of the tachometric relay or oil pressure switch. Where solenoids are fitted to the outputs of fuel tanks, these are also connected to the output of the tachometric relay or oil pressure switch. In installations with multiple tanks, a switch or changeover relay may be fitted to allow the driver to select which tank to use fuel from. On bi-fuel, the switch used to change between fuels is used to turn off the tachometric relay.|$|R
5000|$|Most rotaries had normal inlet valves, so {{that the}} fuel (and {{lubricating}} oil) was taken into the cylinders already mixed with air - as in a normal four-stroke engine. Although a conventional carburetor, {{with the ability to}} keep the fuel/air ratio constant over a range of throttle openings, was precluded by the spinning crankcase; it was possible to adjust the air supply through a separate flap valve or [...] "bloctube". The pilot needed to set the throttle to the desired setting (usually full open) and then adjust the fuel/air mixture to suit using a separate [...] "fine adjustment" [...] lever that controlled the air supply valve (in the manner of a manual choke control). Due to the rotary engine's large rotational inertia, it was possible to adjust the appropriate fuel/air mixture by trial and error without stalling it, although this varied between different types of engine, and in any case it required a good deal of practice to acquire the necessary knack. After starting the engine with a known setting that allowed it to <b>idle,</b> the air <b>valve</b> was opened until maximum engine speed was obtained.|$|R
