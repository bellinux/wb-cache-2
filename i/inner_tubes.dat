This unexpected increase in Raman lines is attributed to a splitting of the <b>inner</b> <b>tube</b> response.

40|$|Microstructure and {{mechanical}} {{properties of the}} welding zone highly depend on the thickness of <b>inner</b> <b>tube</b> for jointing two tubes using magnetic pulse welding (MPW). In this study, the critical thickness of <b>inner</b> 20 Fe <b>tube</b> for the Al-Fe welding tubes is investigated by combining the theoretical calculation and experiments. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that plastic deformation zone of the <b>inner</b> <b>tube</b> expands from its inner surface to its outer surface. With equilibrium equations and modified Tresca yield criterion, the critical thicknesses of <b>inner</b> <b>tube</b> under various collision velocities are derived so as to assure the high quality of the welding.

5000|$|Traditional {{designs of}} {{pneumatic}} tires required a separate <b>inner</b> <b>tube</b> which could fail {{for a number}} of reasons, such as incorrect tire fit, friction between the tire wall and <b>inner</b> <b>tube</b> generating excess heat, or a puncture. Tubeless tire technology does away with the need for an <b>inner</b> <b>tube</b> thereby increasing safety. In a tubeless tire, the tire and the rim of the wheel form an airtight seal, with the valve being directly mounted on the rim. If a tubeless tire gets a small puncture, air escapes only through the hole, leading to a gentle deflation. Conversely, an <b>inner</b> <b>tube</b> could potentially burst like a balloon, leading to deflation of the tire which could result in sudden loss of control of the vehicle. However, the [...] "bursting like a balloon" [...] scenario is highly unlikely due to fact that the <b>inner</b> <b>tube</b> is inside of the tire and will deflate at a rate proportional to the puncture hole size.|$|R

25|$|The air {{conditioning}} system on the new Insight has an expanded thermodynamic range compared to conventional systems. Unlike the separate low pressure and high pressure refrigerant pipes used in conventional systems, the Insight has its low pressure cold pipe enclosing the high pressure hot refrigerant pipe that allows the cold refrigerant on its {{way back to the}} engine bay to cool the warm refrigerant traveling to the cabin. A unique, spiral groove along the outside of the inner pipe increases the surface area and therefore the efficiency of the heat transfer between the outer and <b>inner</b> <b>tubes.</b> This improves the thermal efficiency of the air-conditioning system and, as a result, less effort is required from the compressor, resulting in improved fuel efficiency.|$|E
25|$|A tube of {{particular}} structural, seismic, economic, and political {{interest is the}} BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) transbay tube. This tube was constructed {{at the bottom of}} San Francisco Bay through an innovative process. Rather than pushing a shield through the soft bay mud, the tube was constructed on land in sections. Each section consisted of two inner train tunnels of circular cross section, a central access tunnel of rectangular cross section, and an outer oval shell encompassing the three <b>inner</b> <b>tubes.</b> The intervening space was filled with concrete. At the bottom of the bay a trench was excavated and a flat bed of crushed stone prepared to receive the tube sections. The sections were then floated into place and sunk, then joined with bolted connections to previously-placed sections. An overfill was then placed atop the tube to hold it down. Once completed from San Francisco to Oakland, the tracks and electrical components were installed. The predicted response of the tube during a major earthquake was likened to be as that of a string of (cooked) spaghetti in a bowl of gelatin dessert. To avoid overstressing the tube due to differential movements at each end, a sliding slip joint was included at the San Francisco terminus under the landmark Ferry Building.|$|E

30|$|The {{electrical}} transport {{properties of}} DWCNTs characterized by multi-stable conductance states might originate from their larruping microstructures: small diameter and two layers. It {{is said that}} the weak interwall interactions can activate low-frequency librational motion about and vibration motion normal to the tube axis for the <b>inner</b> <b>tube</b> in DWCNTs [16]. It {{may be hard to}} believe that the entire <b>inner</b> <b>tube</b> vibrate or librate; however, it is possible for some small part of the twisted <b>inner</b> <b>tube</b> to vibrate or librate independently under the equilibrium of the van der Waals interaction between layers with the elastic force of the graphene layers. There may be orientational dislocations or twist frozen in DWCNTs during their synthesis. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) observation revealed that there are smaller (0.39 nm) interlayer spaces with the commensurate lattice and larger (0.54 nm) spaces also in the same DWCNT [30]. Calculations also indicated that the interwall interactions can induce electron transfer from outer tube to interwall region, and then the outer tube can be viewed as being hole doped by the <b>inner</b> <b>tube</b> [31]. When the <b>inner</b> <b>tube</b> (or part of it) changes its configuration about the tube axis sporadically, the amount of charge transfer will change accordingly, and then the Fermi level will shift. We believe that the VG can disturb the charge distribution in the interwall region, and then the configuration of DWCNTs. When the <b>inner</b> <b>tube</b> vibrates normal to the <b>tube</b> axis, the <b>inner</b> <b>tube</b> is close to the outer tube on one side and far away on the other side, which will serve as the new factor for electron scattering [32].|$|R

An additional problem is designing a mechanism that can be implemented at a small scale that is robust and versatile enough to be used for a variety of core samples. This design consists of a set of tubes (a drill <b>tube</b> and an <b>inner</b> <b>tube)</b> and a rolling element (rolling tooth). An additional tube {{can be used as a}} sample tube. The drill <b>tube</b> and the <b>inner</b> <b>tube</b> have longitudinal holes with the axes offset from the axis of each tube. The two eccentricities are equal. The <b>inner</b> <b>tube</b> fits inside the drill tube, and the sample tube fits inside the <b>inner</b> <b>tube.</b> While drilling, the two tubes are positioned relative to each other such that the sample tube is aligned with the drill tube axis and core. The drill tube includes teeth and flutes for cuttings removal. The <b>inner</b> <b>tube</b> includes, at the base, the rolling element implemented as a wheel on a shaft in an eccentric slot. An additional slot in the <b>inner</b> <b>tube</b> and a pin in the drill tube limit the relative motion of the two tubes. While drilling, the drill assembly rotates relative to the core and forces the rolling tooth to stay hidden in the slot along the <b>inner</b> <b>tube</b> wall. When the drilling depth has been reached, the drill bit assembly is rotated in the opposite direction, and the rolling tooth is engaged and penetrates into the core.
