5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the fires, erosion was a particular concern, especially as the rains were heavy the following year. Helicopters dropped millions of gallons of water on the fires, and water retrieval from a few small creeks actually dropped the water level temporarily. Stream flow was also affected by water-pumping operations. The more than a million gallons of <b>diammonium</b> phosphate-based fire-retardant material polluted some streams, but this too was transient and had no long term ill effects on water quality. Fire fighting foams used on wildfires differ from those used for other situations such as fuel fires. They are very low in toxicity and were believed to have completely dispersed by the spring of 1989.|$|E
5|$|Stations in Paradip and Bhubaneswar each {{recorded}} sustained {{winds of}} 150km/h (90mph) before their instruments failed. Winds of 175km/h (110mph) were measured in Puri as the cyclone {{passed to the}} north. The strong winds damaged electric lines and uprooted trees over 50years old in Puri and Kendrapada. Downed power lines across the state cut off communications between Odisha {{and the rest of}} the world for over 24hours and caused widespread power outages. According to the Southern Electricity Supply Corporation, damage to the power grid caused by the cyclone totaled ₹330million (US$4.4million). Stalling over land, the Odisha cyclone dropped torrential rainfall, with 24-hour rainfall rates at times exceeding 20cm (7.9in); Paradip documented 53cm (20.9in) over one 24-hour period. Over the course of the storm's passage, total rainfall amounts over 60cm (23.6in) occurred over a large swath of Odisha. The highest recorded rainfall total was documented in Oupada, which measured 95.5cm (37.60in) of rain over a three-day period. Flooding caused by the storm was estimated to have killed approximately 2,000people. The heavy rains flattened thatched huts and damaged roads and other infrastructure. Within the seven worst affected districts, over 70%of homes were destroyed; most of these were thatched homes, though 10–15%of non-thatch roofed homes were also destroyed. Approximately 11,000schools were either significantly damaged or destroyed. All major district roads in the area were either washed out or blocked by felled trees. In Bhubaneswar, 60%of trees were flattened by the winds and rain; aerial surveys revealed that the entire city was submerged by floodwaters. Adjacent areas were nearly stripped of all tree cover. Until 8November, the city remained without power. The inundation induced by the far-reaching storm surge and heavy rain kept Konark submerged in knee-deep water for six days after landfall. Over the course of four days, the excessive rainfall caused the flooding of the Baitarani, Brahmani, Budhabalanga, Kharasua, and Salandi rivers, resulting in 20,005flood embankment breaches and the damaging of 6headworks. Thousands of people suffered chemical burns after the flooding mixed industrial chemicals into bathing ponds. Oswal Chemicals and Fertilisers, which maintained the world's largest <b>diammonium</b> phosphate plant, reported severe damage to the facility. In the five Odishan districts most affected, all electric water pumps were disabled, though hand pumps remained operable.|$|E
25|$|Major two-component {{fertilizers}} {{provide both}} {{nitrogen and phosphorus}} to the plants. These are called NP fertilizers. The main NP fertilizers are monoammonium phosphate (MAP) and <b>diammonium</b> phosphate (DAP). The active ingredient in MAP is NH4H2PO4. The active ingredient in DAP is (NH4)2HPO4. About 85% of MAP and DAP fertilizers are soluble in water.|$|E
25|$|Like yeast, the {{lactic acid}} {{bacteria}} (LAB) used in malolactic fermentation (generally Oenococcus oeni) requires nitrogen. However, unlike S. cerevisiae LAB can not utilize ammonia and such additions like <b>diammonium</b> phosphate (DAP) offers no nutritional benefits. Winemakers who inadvertently use DAP as a nutrient additive for their MLF inoculation risk providing nutrients instead for spoilage organisms such as Brettanomyces.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) {{limits the}} use of <b>diammonium</b> {{phosphate}} as a nitrogen additive to 968mg/l (8lbs/1000 gal) which provides 203mg N/L of YAN. In the European Union, most countries follow the guidelines of the International Organisation of Vine and Wine (OIV) which dictates a limit of 300mg/L. In Australia, the limit {{is based on the}} level of inorganic phosphate with a maximum limit of 400mg/l of phosphate permitted.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is {{generally}} {{thought to be}} a metabolic by-product of yeast fermentation in nitrogen limited environments. It is formed when yeast ferments via the sulfate reduction pathway. Fermenting wine is often supplemented with <b>diammonium</b> phosphate (DAP) as a nitrogen source to prevent H2S formation. The sensory threshold for hydrogen sulfide is 8-10 μg/L, with levels above this imparting a distinct rotten egg aroma to the wine. Hydrogen sulfide can further react with wine compounds to form mercaptans and disulfides.|$|E
25|$|Yeast assimilable {{nitrogen}} or YAN is {{the combination}} of Free Amino Nitrogen (FAN), ammonia (NH3) and ammonium (NH4+) that is available for the wine yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to use during fermentation. Outside of the fermentable sugars glucose and fructose, nitrogen {{is the most important}} nutrient needed to carry out a successful fermentation that doesn't end prior to the intended point of dryness or sees the development of off-odors and related wine faults. To this extent winemakers will often supplement the available YAN resources with nitrogen additives such as <b>diammonium</b> phosphate (DAP).|$|E
25|$|Despite these setbacks, Borlaug found encouragement. Visiting Ethiopia in 1994, Jimmy Carter won Prime Minister Meles Zenawi's {{support for}} a {{campaign}} seeking to aid farmers, using the fertilizer <b>diammonium</b> phosphate and Borlaug's methods. The following season, Ethiopia recorded the largest harvests of major crops in history, with a 32% increase in production, and a 15% increase in average yield over the previous season. For Borlaug, the rapid increase in yields suggested that there was still hope for higher food production throughout sub-Saharan Africa, despite lingering questions {{and the absence of}} long-term studies.|$|E
25|$|Many {{of these}} {{nutrients}} {{are available in}} the must and skins of the grapes themselves but sometimes are supplemented by winemakers with additions such as <b>diammonium</b> phosphate (DAP), freeze-dried micro-nutrients (such as Go-Ferm and Ferm-K) and even the remnant of dead or extracted yeast cells such that the fermenting yeast can break down to mine for available nitrogen and nutrients. One historical winemaking tradition that is still practiced in some Italian wine regions is the ripasso method of adding the leftover pomace from the pressing of other wines into a newly fermenting batch of wine as an additional food source for the yeast.|$|E
25|$|Sodium {{bicarbonate}} {{can be used}} {{to extinguish}} small grease or electrical fires by being thrown over the fire, as heating of sodium bicarbonate releases carbon dioxide. However, it should not be applied to fires in deep fryers; the sudden release of gas may cause the grease to splatter. Sodium bicarbonate is used in BC dry chemical fire extinguishers {{as an alternative to the}} more corrosive <b>diammonium</b> phosphate in ABC extinguishers. The alkaline nature of sodium bicarbonate makes it the only dry chemical agent, besides Purple-K, that was used in large-scale fire suppression systems installed in commercial kitchens. Because it can act as an alkali, the agent has a mild saponification effect on hot grease, which forms a smothering, soapy foam.|$|E
25|$|While arginine, {{glutamine}} {{and other}} amino acids are rapidly consumed often {{very early in}} fermentation, proline is not consumed by yeast at all during the normal, anaerobic conditions of fermentations. This is {{because one of the}} enzymes required for its use is an oxidase (requiring molecular oxygen) and the other is repressed by the presence of ammonium (another source of assimilable nitrogen needed by yeast) in the must. However, well aerated starter cultures that contain must which hasn't had any <b>diammonium</b> phosphate added it to it will usually see some utilization of proline before the anaerobic conditions of fermentation kick in. When winemakers measure FAN, they need to be aware if their assay is including proline since this will make their YAN measurement higher. Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon are two Vitis vinifera varieties that are known to have very high proline levels while Riesling and Sauvignon blanc usually have very low levels.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 2007, {{the prices}} of {{fertilizers}} of all kinds increased dramatically, peaking around the summer of 2008 (see graphs by the International Fertilizer Industry Association). Prices approximately tripled for ammonia, urea, <b>diammonium</b> phosphate, muriate of potash (KCl), and sulfuric acid (used for making phosphate fertilizer), and then fell just as dramatically {{in the latter part}} of 2008. Some prices doubled within the six months before April 2008. Part of the cause for these price rises was the rise in the price of oil, since the most fertilizers require petroleum or natural gas to manufacture. Although the main fossil fuel input for fertilizer comes from natural gas to generate hydrogen for the Haber–Bosch process (see: Ammonia production), natural gas has its own supply problems similar to those for oil. Because natural gas can substitute for petroleum in some uses (for example, natural gas liquids and electricity generation), increasing prices for petroleum lead to increasing prices for natural gas, and thus for fertilizer.|$|E

2500|$|The {{source for}} these {{nutrients}} is {{often found in}} the grape must itself, though MLF inoculations that run concurrent with alcoholic fermentation risk the yeast outcompeting the bacteria for these nutrients.
