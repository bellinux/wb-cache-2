5|$|Telangiectasias and {{arteriovenous}} malformations in HHT {{are thought}} to arise because of changes in angiogenesis, the development of blood vessels out of existing ones. The {{development of a new}} blood vessel requires the activation and migration of various types of cells, chiefly endothelium, smooth muscle and pericytes. The exact mechanism by which the HHT mutations influence this process is not yet clear, and it is likely that they disrupt a balance between pro- and antiangiogenic signals in blood vessels. The wall of telangiectasias is unusually <b>friable,</b> which explains the tendency of these lesions to bleed.|$|E
5|$|Shepherd {{satellites}} {{are small}} moons that orbit within, or just beyond, a planet's ring system. They {{have the effect}} of sculpting the rings: giving them sharp edges, and creating gaps between them. Saturn's shepherd moons are Pan (Encke gap), Daphnis (Keeler gap), Atlas (A Ring), Prometheus (F Ring) and Pandora (F Ring). These moons together with co-orbitals (see below) probably formed as a result of accretion of the <b>friable</b> ring material on preexisting denser cores. The cores with sizes from one-third to one-half the present day moons may be themselves collisional shards formed when a parental satellite of the rings disintegrated.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} types of rock beneath the soil strongly influence the landscape; they determine the type of vegetation that will grow, and ultimately the type of animal that will inhabit the area. Limestone has fissures and is soluble in water, therefore rivers {{have been able to}} carve deep, narrow valleys. The rivers then often find routes underground, creating cave systems. Millstone Grit is insoluble but porous, absorbing water which seeps through the grits, until it meets the less porous shales beneath, creating springs where it reaches the surface. The shales are <b>friable</b> and easily attacked by frost and form areas that are vulnerable to landslides, as on Mam Tor.|$|E
5|$|Erosion can be {{the result}} of {{material}} movement by the wind. There are two main effects. First, wind causes small particles to be lifted and therefore moved to another region. This is called deflation. Second, these suspended particles may impact on solid objects causing erosion by abrasion (ecological succession). Wind erosion generally occurs in areas with little or no vegetation, often in areas where there is insufficient rainfall to support vegetation. An example is the formation of sand dunes, on a beach or in a desert. Loess is a homogeneous, typically nonstratified, porous, <b>friable,</b> slightly coherent, often calcareous, fine-grained, silty, pale yellow or buff, windblown (Aeolian) sediment. It generally occurs as a widespread blanket deposit that covers areas of hundreds of square kilometers and tens of meters thick. Loess often stands in either steep or vertical faces. Loess tends to develop into highly rich soils. Under appropriate climatic conditions, areas with loess are among the most agriculturally productive in the world. Loess deposits are geologically unstable by nature, and will erode very readily. Therefore, windbreaks (such as big trees and bushes) are often planted by farmers to reduce the wind erosion of loess.|$|E
25|$|The soil {{generally}} is a sandy loam or a strong but <b>friable</b> clay, and very fertile. Large quantities of seaweed {{as well as}} lime and marl are available for manure.|$|E
25|$|As a {{burrowing}} species, Townsend's ground squirrels select {{sites with}} deep, <b>friable,</b> well-drained soils. In southeastern Idaho, 68% of Townsend's ground squirrel burrows were in sand, 28% in silt, and 4% in clay.|$|E
25|$|Overall, the Hunter Valley {{has more}} soils (mostly hard, acidic patches of poorly {{draining}} heavy clay) that are unsuitable for viticulture {{than they have}} areas that are ideal for growing grapes. The soils of the Lower Hunter vary widely from sandy alluvial flats (often planted to Semillon), to deep <b>friable</b> loam (often planted with Shiraz) and <b>friable</b> red duplex soils. In the Upper Hunter, the rivers and creeks of the region contribute to the areas black, silty loam soils that are often overlaid on top of alkaline clay loam. Among the hills of the Brokenback range are strips of volcanic basalt that are prized by growers for their tendencies to restrict vigor and concentrate mineral flavours in the grapes.|$|E
25|$|An {{initial survey}} by the California Department of Education found that {{nearly half of the}} state's school {{facilities}} contained <b>friable</b> (easily crumbled) asbestos. It was found in gyms, hallways, boiler rooms and classrooms. Maintenance workers, custodians and all school employees felt at risk.|$|E
25|$|Pumice, <b>friable</b> pumice-like gray-brown porous {{formations}} {{formed from}} molten brown corium foamed with steam when immersed in water. Located in the {{pressure suppression pool}} in large heaps near the sink openings, where they were carried by water flow as they were light enough to float.|$|E
25|$|The type of soils that {{dominate}} the upland areas are Tagaytay loam and Tagaytay sandy loam with mountain soil undifferentiated found on the south-eastern side bordering Laguna province. Also on the southern tip are Magallanes clay and Mountain soil undifferentiated with interlacing of Magallanes clay loam steep phase. The Tagaytay loam contains fine sandy materials, moderately <b>friable,</b> and easy to work on when moist. In an undisturbed condition, it bakes and becomes hard when dry. About one-half of this soil type is devoted to upland rice and upland crops. On the other hand, Tagaytay sandy loam is <b>friable</b> and granular with considerable amount of volcanic sand and underlain by adobe clay. Mountain soil undifferentiated is forested with bamboos found in the sea coast. Cavite also has the Patungan sand characterized by pale gray to almost white sand with substratum of marine conglomerates which are found at Sta. Mercedes in Maragondon and in some coastlines of Ternate.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the ban, {{asbestos}} {{was widely}} used {{in the construction industry}} in thousands of materials. Some are judged to be more dangerous than others due to the amount of asbestos and the material's <b>friable</b> nature. Sprayed coatings, pipe insulation and Asbestos Insulating Board (AIB) are thought to be the most dangerous due to their high content of asbestos and <b>friable</b> nature. Many older buildings built before the late 1990s contain asbestos. In the United States, there is a minimum standard for asbestos surveys as described by ASTM Standard E 2356â€“04. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency includes some but not all asbestos-contaminated facilities on the Superfund National Priorities list (NPL). Renovation and demolition of asbestos contaminated buildings is subject to EPA NESHAP and OSHA Regulations. Asbestos is not a material covered under CERCLA's innocent purchaser defense. In the UK, the removal and disposal of asbestos and of substances containing it are covered by the Control of Asbestos Regulations 2006.|$|E
25|$|Exposure to {{asbestos}} in {{the form}} of fibers is always considered dangerous. Working with, or exposure to, material that is <b>friable,</b> or materials or works that could cause release of loose asbestos fibers, is considered high risk. However, in general, people who become ill from inhaling asbestos have been regularly exposed in a job where they worked directly with the material.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanical}} {{action of the}} glacier de la Durance was facilitated {{by the presence of}} relatively <b>friable</b> layers. The part which is central and south-east of the town consists mainly of soft rocks (Callovo-Oxfordian black marl). They consist of soft schist of bluish or brown colors. In the northwestern part are the harder rocks of lighter colours, Tithonian limestone, formed in places of rocky bars or cornices.|$|E
25|$|Their gross {{appearance}} is solid, <b>friable,</b> and yellow, with necrotic and hemorrhagic areas. They also often contain cysts that can degenerate or rupture. Histologically, yolk sac tumors {{are characterized by}} the presence of Schiller-Duval bodies (which are pathognomonic for yolk sac tumors) and a reticular pattern. Yolk sac tumors commonly secrete alpha-fetoprotein and can be immunohistochemically stained for its presence; the level of alpha-fetoprotein in the blood is a useful marker of recurrence.|$|E
25|$|Asbestos {{is found}} in older homes and buildings, but occurs most {{commonly}} in schools, hospitals and industrial settings. Although all asbestos is hazardous, products that are <b>friable,</b> eg. sprayed coatings and insulation, pose a significantly higher hazard as {{they are more likely}} to release fibers to the air. The US Federal Government and some states have set standards for acceptable levels of asbestos fibers in indoor air. There are particularly stringent regulations applicable to schools.|$|E
25|$|Farms {{with large}} {{livestock}} and poultry operations, such as factory farms, are called concentrated animal feeding operations or feedlots in the US {{and are being}} subject to increasing government regulation. Animal slurries are usually treated by containment in anaerobic lagoons before disposal by spray or trickle application to grassland. Constructed wetlands are sometimes used to facilitate treatment of animal wastes. Some animal slurries are treated by mixing with straw and composted at high temperature to produce a bacteriologically sterile and <b>friable</b> manure for soil improvement.|$|E
25|$|As a hard, rigid solid {{in the dry}} state, soil {{becomes a}} crumbly (<b>friable)</b> semisolid when a certain {{moisture}} content, termed the shrinkage limit, is reached. If it is an expansive soil, this soil will also begin to swell in volume as this moisture content is exceeded. Increasing the water content beyond the soil's plastic limit will transform it into a malleable, plastic mass, which causes additional swelling. The soil will remain in this plastic state until its liquid limit is exceeded, which causes it to transform into a viscous liquid that flows when jarred.|$|E
25|$|Sangiovese {{has shown}} {{itself to be}} {{adaptable}} to {{many different types of}} vineyard soils but seems to thrive in soils with a high concentration of limestone, having the potential to produce elegant wines with forceful aromas. In the Chianti Classico region, Sangiovese thrives on the highly <b>friable</b> shale-clay soil known as galestro. In the Montalcino region, where there is a high proportion of limestone-based alberese soils alternating with deposits of galestro. The lesser zones of the generic Chianti appellation are predominantly clay, which often produce as high quality of wine as alberese and galestro do.|$|E
25|$|Since 2001, {{expanded}} polypropylene (EPP) foams {{have been}} gaining in popularity and in application as a structural material in hobbyist radio control model aircraft. Unlike expanded polystyrene foam (EPS) which is <b>friable</b> and breaks easily on impact, EPP foam {{is able to}} absorb kinetic impacts very well without breaking, retains its original shape, and exhibits memory form characteristics which allow it to return to its original shape in {{a short amount of}} time. In consequence, a radio-control model whose wings and fuselage are constructed from EPP foam is extremely resilient, and able to absorb impacts that would result in complete destruction of models made from lighter traditional materials, such as balsa or even EPS foams.|$|E
25|$|Now the Wilmslow Formation, (part of the Sherwood Sandstone Group), {{the lower}} Triassic was {{previously}} a threefold division, the Lower Mottled Sandstone, The Pebble Beds and the Upper Mottled Sandstone, (only the later is seen at Alderley) which merged into the Conglomerates {{of the upper}} Triassic. The Upper Mottled Sandstone now the lower Wilmslow Member is a medium to coarse-grained <b>friable</b> false-bedded sandstone with abrupt colour changes from bright red to white. It is composed mainly of rounded grains but sub-angular grains also occur. Normally the rock lacks coherence and weathers into sand down to 6m and even unweathered rock can be crushed to sand easily. However near faults, ghost crystals of barites make the sandstone harder and resistant.|$|E
25|$|Tyrrhenus Mons (Tyrrhena Patera) is an eroded, low-lying volcano in {{the western}} part of Hesperia Planum. It is one of the oldest large central-vent volcanoes on the planet and a member of a class of volcanoes called {{highland}} paterae, which erupted mainly in the Late Noachian and Early Hesperian. Tyrrhenus Mons stands only 1.5km above the surrounding plains. At its center lies a 40km diameter depression, or caldera, from which radiate numerous flat-floored valleys and ridges that suggest the volcano has been highly eroded. The low relief of Tyrrhenus Mons combined with its degraded state indicate the volcano consists largely of <b>friable</b> and easily eroded material such as volcanic ash. The ash was likely derived from the interaction of magma with groundwater or ice.|$|E
25|$|In {{an archaeological}} {{excavation}} {{of the road}} at {{the southern edge of}} Bourne (TF098193), where it ran across a margin between Kellaways clay and the argillaceous (clayey) Kellaways sand, {{it was found that the}} construction of the carriageway had been done by digging two parallel shallow trenches into the subsoil and over-filling them with gravel ballast so as to form kerbs. Coarse sand was used to form the carriageway between them. This was a skilful use of the available materials as south of Kate's Bridge, the road passes over such minerals but little but rather <b>friable</b> Cornbrash is available near the excavated site. Clearly, this part of the road was constructed from the south, northwards and the materials carried along it. However, further north, in the Long Hollow, cornbrash from Sapperton TF019239, seems to have been used (Lane p.23.) Again, the use is north of the source.|$|E
25|$|After fairly {{favourable}} {{climatic conditions}} in the 1920s with good rainfall and relatively moderate winters, which permitted increased settlement and cultivation in the Great Plains, the region entered an unusually dry era {{in the summer of}} 1930. During the next decade, the northern plains suffered four of their seven driest calendar years since 1895, Kansas four of its twelve driest, and the entire region south to West Texas lacked any period of above-normal rainfall until record rains hit in 1941. When severe drought struck the Great Plains region in the 1930s, it resulted in erosion and loss of topsoil because of farming practices at the time. The drought dried the topsoil and over time it became <b>friable,</b> reduced to a powdery consistency in some places. Without the indigenous grasses in place, the high winds that occur on the plains picked up the topsoil and created the massive dust storms that marked the Dust Bowl period. The persistent dry weather caused crops to fail, leaving the plowed fields exposed to wind erosion. The fine soil of the Great Plains was easily eroded and carried east by strong continental winds.|$|E
25|$|Three {{other main}} beds are seen at Alderley Edge. The first is <b>friable</b> mottled {{sandstone}} {{similar to the}} Upper Mottled Sandstone, the Beacon Lodge Sandstone which attains a thickness of 12m and {{can be seen at}} Beacon Lodge resting above the conglomerates. The second is a conglomerate which overlies the Brynlow and is seen by the site of the old mines and is thus called the West Mine Conglomerate. There are ten upward fining cycles in this rock and it has a thickness of 40m. The third rock is creamy white sandstone, which lacks the pebbly beds and is upward fining; it overlies the West Mine Conglomerate and is seen in outcrops at Brynlow. This is the Wood Mine Sandstone it has a thickness of 16m. Two other minor beds are seen to the southeast of these areas a single cycle conglomerate/sandstone/marl of 9m thickness known as the Brynlow conglomerate and a final bed that overlies the Brynlow Conglomerate and is named the Nether Alderley Sandstone. On top of the Nether Alderley Sandstone lie the Mercia Mudstones which attain a thickness of 300m, but these are only seen on the lower plains, it is in these beds that the halite lies.|$|E
500|$|LIke the cathedrals of Carlisle, Lichfield and Worcester, Chester Cathedral {{is built}} of New Red Sandstone, [...] {{in this case}} Keuper Sandstone from the Cheshire Basin. The stone lends itself to {{detailed}} carving, but is also <b>friable,</b> easily eroded by rain and wind, and is badly affected by pollution. With the other red sandstone buildings, Chester {{is one of the}} most heavily restored of England's cathedrals. The restoration, which included much refacing and many new details, took place mainly in the 19thcentury.|$|E
500|$|Tirunelveli {{is located}} at , and its average {{elevation}} is [...] It {{is located at}} the southernmost tip of the Deccan plateau. The Tamirabarani River divides the city into the Tirunelveli quarter and the Palayamkottai area. The river (with its tributaries, such as the Chittar) is the major source of irrigation, and is fed by the northeast and southwest monsoons. The major lakes in the city are Nainar Lake and Udayarpetti Lake. The area around the Tamirabarani River and the Chittar has five streams: Kodagan, Palayan, Tirunelveli, Marudur East and Marudur West, and the Chittar feeds fifteen other channels. The soil is <b>friable,</b> red and sandy.|$|E
500|$|Amanita exitialis, {{also known}} as the Guangzhou {{destroying}} angel, is a mushroom of the large genus Amanita. It is distributed in eastern Asia, and probably also in India where it has been misidentified as A.verna. Deadly poisonous, it is a member of section Phalloideae and related to the death cap A.phalloides. The fruit bodies (mushrooms) are white, small to medium-sized with caps up to [...] in diameter, a somewhat <b>friable</b> ring and a firm volva. Unlike most agaric mushrooms which typically have four-spored basidia (spore-bearing cells), the basidia of A.exitialis are almost entirely two-spored. Eight people were fatally poisoned in China after consuming the mushroom in 2000, and another 20 have been fatally poisoned since that incident. Molecular analysis shows that the species has a close phylogenetic relationship with three other toxic white Amanitas: A.subjunquillea var. alba, A.virosa and A.bisporigera.|$|E
500|$|Most of the sand, made of 98% translucent, rounded-grain quartz, was transported from coastal {{sand dunes}} to the west, {{in what is}} now central Nevada. Today the Navajo Sandstone is a {{geographically}} widespread, pale tan to red cliff and monolith former with very obvious sand dune cross-bedding patterns (...) [...] Typically the lower part of this remarkably homogeneous formation is reddish from iron oxide that percolated from the overlaying iron-rich Temple Cap formation while {{the upper part of the}} formation is a pale tan to nearly white color. The other component of the Navajo's weak cement matrix is calcium carbonate, but the resulting sandstone is <b>friable</b> (crumbles easily) and very porous. [...] Cross-bedding is especially evident in the eastern part of the park where Jurassic wind directions changed often. The crosshatched appearance of Checkerboard Mesa is a good example (...) [...]|$|E
500|$|Coprinellus micaceus is a saprotrophic species, {{deriving}} {{nutrients from}} dead and decomposing organic matter, and grows {{in and around}} stumps or logs of broad-leaved trees or attached to buried wood. It prefers feeding on bark, particularly the secondary phloem, rather than the wood. In the scheme of the succession of fungal species involved in the decomposition of wood, C.micaceus is a late stage colonizer, and prefers to feed on wood that has already decomposed sufficiently to have reached [...] "a <b>friable</b> softened consistency". A 2010 study suggests that the fungus can also live as an endophyte, inhabiting the woody tissue of healthy trees without causing disease symptoms. The fungus is also associated with disturbed or developed ground, such as the sides of roads and paths, gardens, building sites and the edges of parking lots; {{it has also been}} noted for growing indoors on rotting wood in humid environments. In one instance it was discovered about 120m (400ft) underground in an abandoned coal mine, growing on wooden gangways and props used to support the roof.|$|E
2500|$|Crocidolite {{commonly}} {{occurs as}} soft <b>friable</b> fibers. Asbestiform amphibole may also occur as soft <b>friable</b> fibers but some varieties such as amosite are commonly straighter. All forms of asbestos are fibrillar {{in that they}} are composed of fibers with breadths less than 1 micrometer in bundles of very great widths. Asbestos with particularly fine fibers is also referred to as [...] "amianthus".|$|E
2500|$|The {{endoscopic}} {{appearance in}} eosinophilic gastroenteritis is nonspecific; it includes erythematous, <b>friable,</b> nodular, and occasional ulcerative changes.|$|E
2500|$|Apart {{from recent}} {{alluvial}} deposits, the other main {{rock in the}} valley is Hauturu Sandstone, which is mid to late Whaingaroan, about 30 million years old. It is commonly knobbly due to resistant bands and lenses of hard calcareous sandstone in soft <b>friable</b> quartzofeldspathic sand ...|$|E
2500|$|Tilmanstone coal {{was taken}} to {{customers}} elsewhere on the main line in the EKLR's own wagons. The major ones were Hammill brickworks and Wingham Engineering. [...] Since Kent coal was <b>friable</b> and not suitable for all purposes, the railway also handled coal ordered from other coalfields. [...] There was a coal merchants' located at Staple station.|$|E
2500|$|Caseous {{necrosis}} can {{be considered}} a combination of coagulative and liquefactive necrosis, typically caused by mycobacteria (e.g. tuberculosis), fungi and some foreign substances. The necrotic tissue appears as white and <b>friable,</b> like clumped cheese. Dead cells disintegrate but are not completely digested, leaving granular particles. Microscopic examination shows amorphous granular debris enclosed within a distinctive inflammatory border. Granuloma has this characteristic.|$|E
2500|$|The {{project area}} {{lies in the}} narrow gorge section of the Magdalena River. The rock {{formation}} is of <b>friable</b> sandstones of tertiary age. It is [...] upstream from {{the confluence of the}} Magdalena and PÃ¡ez Rivers. The contractor will provide about 48,000 million pesos to build the perimeter road that will boost tourism and commercial development southwest of the Huila Department.|$|E
2500|$|The {{turquoise}} {{occurs as}} vein or seam fillings, and as compact nuggets; these are mostly small in size. While quite fine material is sometimes foundâ€”rivalling Iranian material in both colour and durabilityâ€”most American turquoise is {{of a low}} grade (called [...] "chalk turquoise"); high iron levels mean greens and yellows predominate, and a typically <b>friable</b> consistency in the turquoise's untreated state precludes use in jewellery.|$|E
