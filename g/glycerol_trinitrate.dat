40|$|Various nitrate esters, such as <b>glycerol</b> <b>trinitrate,</b> {{erythritol}} tetranitrate, and mannitol hexanitrate, {{have for}} many years {{been used in the}} treatment of hyper-tension, but the exact mechanism of their action has not been well defined. Leech (1) believed that the nitrite ion found in the blood after ingestion of or-ganic nitrates was responsible for the pharmacological response. The basic action of the nitrite ion in the body is the lowering of tone and the relaxation of arterial muscles, producing a prompt fall in blood pressure. Crandall et al.

40|$|<b>Glycerol</b> <b>trinitrate</b> reductase (NerA) from Agrobacterium radiobacter, {{a member}} of the old yellow enzyme (OYE) family of oxidoreductases, was {{expressed}} in and purified from Escherichia coli. Denaturation of pure enzyme liberated flavin mononucleotide (FMN), and spectra of NerA during reduction and reoxidation confirmed its catalytic involvement. Binding of FMN to apoenzyme to form the holoenzyme occurred with a dissociation constant of ca. 10 - 7 M and with restoration of activity. The NerA-dependent reduction of <b>glycerol</b> <b>trinitrate</b> (GTN; nitroglycerin) by NADH followed ping-pong kinetics. A structural model of NerA based on the known coordinates of OYE showed that His- 178, Asn- 181, and Tyr- 183 were close to FMN in the active site. The NerA mutation H 178 A produced mutant protein with bound FMN but no activity toward GTN. The N 181 A mutation produced protein that did not bind FMN and was isolated in partly degraded form. The mutation Y 183 F produced active protein with the same kcat as that of wild-type enzyme but with altered Km values for GTN and NADH, indicating a role for this residue in substrate binding. Correlation of the ratio of KmGTN to KmNAD(P) H, with sequence differences for NerA and several other members of the OYE family of oxidoreductases that reduce GTN, indicated that Asn- 181 and a second Asn- 238 that lies close to Tyr- 183 in the NerA model structure may influence substrate specificity...|$|E

METHODS: Brain BDNF protein levels were measured before and after in situ removal of the cerebral endothelium that was achieved by brain perfusion with a 0. 2 % CHAPS (3 -[(3 -cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]- 1 -propane sulphonate) solution. BDNF protein and mRNA levels as well as levels of endothelial NO synthase phosphorylated at serine 1177 (P-eNOSser 1177) were measured in cerebral microvessel-enriched fractions. These fractions were also exposed to <b>glycerol</b> <b>trinitrate.</b> Hypertension (spontaneously hypertensive rats) and physical exercise training were used as experimental approaches to modulate cerebrovascular endothelial NO production. RESULTS: CHAPS perfusion resulted in a marked decrease in brain BDNF levels. Hypertension decreased and exercise increased P-eNOSser 1177 and BDNF protein levels. However, BDNF mRNA levels that were increased by exercise did not change after hypertension. Finally, in vitro exposure of cerebral microvessel-enriched fractions to <b>glycerol</b> <b>trinitrate</b> enhanced BDNF production. CONCLUSION: These data reveal that BDNF levels measured in brain homogenates correspond for a large part to BDNF present in cerebral endothelial cells and that cerebrovascular BDNF production is dependent on cerebrovascular endothelial eNOS activity.

40|$|Soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) is an {{important}} effector for nitric oxide (NO). It acts by increasing intracellular cyclic GMP (cGMP) levels to mediate numerous biological functions. Recently, 1 H-[1, 2, 4]oxadiazolo[4, 3,-a]quinoxalin- 1 -one (ODQ) {{was identified as a}} novel and selective inhibitor of this enzyme. Therefore, ODQ may represent {{an important}} pharmacological tool for differentiating cGMP-mediated from cGMP-independent effects of NO. In the present study, we examined the inhibitory action of ODQ both functionally and biochemically. In phenylephrine-preconstricted, endothelium-intact, isolated aortic rings from the rat, ODQ, in a concentration-dependent manner, increased contractile tone and inhibited relaxations to authentic NO with maximal effects at 3 microM. Pretreatment of vascular rings with ODQ induced a parallel, 2 -log-order shift {{to the right of the}} concentration-response curves (CRCs) to histamine, ATP, NO, the NO-donors S-nitrosoglutathione, S-nitroso-N-acetyl-D,L-penicillamine, and spermine NONOate [N-[4 -[1 -(3 -amino propyl) - 2 -hydroxy- 2 -nitroso hydrazino]butyl]- 1, 3 -propane diamine], and the direct sGC-stimulant [3 -(5 '-hydroxymethyl- 2 'furyl) - 1 -benzyl indazole] YC- 1 but did not affect relaxations induced by papaverine and atriopeptin II. Moreover, the rightward shift of the CRCs to Angeli's salt, peroxynitrite, and linsidomine was similar to that of NO. These results suggested that ODQ is specific for sGC. Furthermore, they indicate that NO can cause vasorelaxation independent of cGMP. Three interesting exceptions were observed to the otherwise rather uniform inhibitory effect of ODQ: the responses to acetylcholine, <b>glycerol</b> <b>trinitrate,</b> and sodium nitroprusside. The latter two agents are known to require metabolic activation, possibly by cytochrome P- 450 -type proteins. The 3 - to 5 -log-order rightward shift of their CRCs suggests that, in addition to sGC, ODQ may interfere with heme proteins involved in the bioactivation of these NO donors and the mechanism of vasorelaxation mediated by acetylcholine. In support of this notion, ODQ inhibited hepatic microsomal NO production from both <b>glycerol</b> <b>trinitrate</b> and sodium nitroprusside as well as NO synthase activity in aortic homogenates. The latter effect seemed to require biotransformation of ODQ. Collectively, these data reveal that ODQ interferes with various heme protein-dependent processes in vascular and hepatic tissue and lacks specificity for sGC...|$|E

A combination of high-pressure liquid chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses of the culture medium during the growth of A. radiobacter on basal salts-glycerol-GTN medium showed the sequential conversion of GTN to glycerol dinitrates and glycerol mononitrates.

However, the {{mechanism}} by which GTN provides NO, in particular in liver, is still unknown. In this study, we provide experimental evidence showing that cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria are required for the release of NO from GTN in the liver. NO and nitrite (NO 2 −) were determined using low-temperature electron paramagnetic resonance and the Griess reaction, respectively. The first step of GTN biotransformation is the release of NO 2 −. This step is performed in cytoplasm and catalyzed by glutathione-S-transferase. The second step is the rate-limiting step where NO 2 − is slowly reduced to NO. This is mainly catalyzed by cytochrome P- 450. The second phase can be significantly enhanced by decreasing the pH value, a situation which occurs during ischemia. At high NADPH concentrations exceeding physiological values, cytochrome P- 450 catalyzes GTN biotransformation without the involvement of cytoplasmic glutathione-S-transferase. In conclusion, our data show that NO 2 − derived from the first step of biotransformation of GTN in the liver is the precursor of NO but not a product of NO degradation; consequently, NO 2 − levels {{are not likely to be}} a marker of NO release from GTN as earlier suggested...|$|E
40|$|GTN (nitroglycerin; <b>glycerol</b> <b>trinitrate)</b> causes {{dilation}} {{of blood}} vessels via activation of nitric oxide (NO) -sensitive sGC (soluble guanylate cyclase), a heterodimeric haem protein that catalyses the conversion of GTP into cGMP. Activation of sGC by GTN requires enzymatic or non-enzymatic bioactivation of the nitrate. Based on insufficient NO release and lack of spectroscopic evidence for formation of NO–sGC, the cysteine (Cys) -dependent activation of sGC by GTN was proposed to occur in an NO-independent manner. This extraordinary claim is questioned by the present findings. First, the effect of GTN/Cys was blocked by the NO scavenger oxyhaemoglobin, the superoxide-generating compound flavin mononucleotide and the haem-site sGC inhibitor ODQ (1 H-[1, 2, 4]oxadiazolo[4, 3 -a]quinoxalin- 1 -one). Secondly, at equi-effective concentrations, GTN/Cys and the NO donor 2, 2 -diethyl- 1 -nitroso-oxyhydrazine released identical amounts of NO. Finally, at sufficiently high rates of NO release, activation of sGC by GTN/Cys {{was accompanied by a}} shift of the Soret band from 431 to 399  nm, indicating formation of NO–sGC. In the absence of Cys, GTN caused haem oxidation, apparent as a shift of the Soret band to 392  nm, which was accompanied by inactivation of the NO-stimulated enzyme. These results suggest that the effect of GTN/Cys is the result of an activation/inactivation equilibrium that is controlled by the rate of NO release and haem oxidation...|$|E
40|$|Four axenic {{bacterial}} species {{capable of}} biodegrading nitroglycerin (<b>glycerol</b> <b>trinitrate</b> [GTN]) were isolated from soil samples {{taken from a}} washwater soakaway at a disused GTN manufacturing plant. The isolates were identified by 16 S rRNA gene sequence homology as Pseudomonas putida, an Arthrobacter species, a Klebsiella species, and a Rhodococcus species. Each of the isolates utilized GTN as its sole nitrogen source and removed nitro groups sequentially from GTN to produce glycerol dinitrates and mononitrates (GMN), {{with the exception of}} the Arthrobacter strain, which achieved removal of only the first nitro group within the time course of the experiment. The Klebsiella strain exhibited a distinct preference for removal of the central nitro group from GTN, while the other five strains exhibited no such regioselectivity. All strains which removed a second nitro group from glycerol 1, 2 -dinitrate showed regiospecific removal of the end nitro group, thereby producing glycerol 2 -mononitrate. Most significant was the finding that the Rhodococcus species was capable of removing the final nitro group from GMN and thus achieved complete biodegradation of GTN. Such complete denitration of GTN has previously been shown only in mixed bacterial populations and in cultures of Penicillium corylophilum Dierckx supplemented with an additional carbon and nitrogen source. Hence, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a microorganism that can achieve complete denitration of GTN...|$|E
40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) is an {{endogenous}} compound, {{which plays}} a fundamental {{role in the}} modulation of the function of the cardiovascular system. where it induces vasorelaxing and antiplatelet responses, mainly through the stimulation of guanylate cyclase and the increase of cGMP. Many drugs of common, time-honoured clinical use (for example, <b>glycerol</b> <b>trinitrate</b> and all the vasodilator nitrites and nitrates) act via the release of exogenous NO, thus mimicking the effects of the endogenous factor. In the last few years, a revision of the "one-compound-one-target" paradigm has led pharmacologists and pharmaceutical chemists to develop new classes of molecules which combine different pharmacodynamic properties. This innovative pharmacological/pharmaceutical strategy has produced hybrid drugs, with a dual mechanism of action: a) the slow release of nitric oxide and b) another fundamental pharmacodynamic profile. These drugs have been obtained by inserting appropriate NO-donor chemical groups (i. e. nitrate esters, nitrosothiols, etc.), linked to a known drug, by means of a variable spacer moiety. These new pharmacodynamic hybrids present the advantage of combining a basic mechanism of action (for example, cyclooxygenase inhibition, beta-antagonism or ACE inhibition) with a slow release of NO, which may be useful either to reduce adverse side effects (for example, the gastrotoxicity of NSAIDs), or to improve the effectiveness of the drug (for example, conferring direct vasorelaxing and antiplatelet effects on an ACE-inhibitor). The aim of this review is to present the chemical features of NO-releasing hybrids of cardiovascular drugs, and to explain the pharmacological improvements obtained by the addition of the NO-donor properties...|$|E
40|$|Drinking {{water in}} the Leipzig area seemed to be {{contaminated}} by explosives made and handled {{near the village of}} Elsnig in the region. The full facts became known only after 1990 and, compared with similar locations in Germany, Elsnig plays an outstanding role due to is large quantities and varieties of explosives with all their byproducts and metabilites (in same samples more than 50 components). This made is necessary to develop and validate additional analytical techniques. Particularly it was necessary to characterized an influence of the Elsnig groundwater matrix on the correctness of analytical results. The studies also focused on the efficiency of an electrochemical detector in analysing real samples. The results can be summarized as follows: Various compounds such as hexyl, hexogen, octogen, tetryl, picric acid, <b>glycerol</b> <b>trinitrate</b> and nitrobenzoic acids cannot or cannot be directly analyzed by gas chromatography. HPLC, in principle, enables all explosives, byproducts and metabolities to be separated and detected. The experimental conditions for this are given. The electrochemical detector is a valuable addition to the UV detector in analysing real samples, but cannot replace it. For the extractive enrichment of all explosives and relevant compounds of water it is necessary to work with 3 different pH-values. A suitable extraction regime was worked out. In solid phase extraction, the Elsnig real-water matrix has a rather strong influence on the recovery rates of a number of substances. In liquid extraction, this influence is considerably smaller.

40|$|The {{reaction}} of pentaerythritol tetranitrate reductase with reducing and oxidizing substrates {{has been studied}} by stopped-flow spectrophotometry, redox potentiometry, and X-ray crystallography. We show in the reductive half-{{reaction of}} pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) reductase that NADPH binds to form an enzyme-NADPH charge transfer intermediate prior to hydride transfer from the nicotinamide coenzyme to FMN. In the oxidative half-reaction, the two-electron-reduced enzyme reacts with several substrates including nitroester explosives (<b>glycerol</b> <b>trinitrate</b> and PETN), nitroaromatic explosives (trinitrotoluene (TNT) and picric acid), and alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds (2 -cyclohexenone). Oxidation of the flavin by the nitroaromatic substrate TNT is kinetically indistinguishable from formation of its hydride-Meisenheimer complex, consistent with a mechanism involving direct nucleophilic attack by hydride from the flavin N 5 atom at the electron-deficient aromatic nucleus of the substrate. The crystal structures of complexes of the oxidized enzyme bound to picric acid and TNT are consistent with direct hydride transfer from the reduced flavin to nitroaromatic substrates. The mode of binding the inhibitor 2, 4 -dinitrophenol (2, 4 -DNP) {{is similar to that}} observed with picric acid and TNT. In this position, however, the aromatic nucleus is not activated for hydride transfer from the flavin N 5 atom, thus accounting for the lack of reactivity with 2, 4 -DNP. Our work with PETN reductase establishes further a close relationship to the Old Yellow Enzyme family of proteins {{but at the same time}} highlights important differences compared with the reactivity of Old Yellow Enzyme. Our studies provide a structural and mechanistic rationale for the ability of PETN reductase to react with the nitroaromatic explosive compounds TNT and picric acid and for the inhibition of enzyme activity with 2, 4 -DNP. 1389...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesWe {{investigated}} whether human age-related endothelial dysfunction {{is accompanied}} by quantitative and qualitative alterations of the endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) pool. BackgroundCirculating progenitor cells with an endothelial phenotype contribute to the regeneration and repair of the vessel wall. An association between the loss of endothelial integrity and EPC modification may provide a background to study the mechanistic nature of such age-related vascular changes. MethodsIn 20 old and young healthy individuals (61 ± 2 years and 25 ± 1 year, respectively) without major cardiovascular risk factors, endothelial function, defined by flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery via ultrasound, {{as well as the}} number and function of EPCs isolated from peripheral blood, were determined. ResultsOlder subjects had significantly impaired endothelium-dependent dilation of brachial artery (flow-mediated dilation [FMD] 5. 2 ± 0. 5 % vs. 7. 1 ± 0. 6 %; p < 0. 05). Endothelium-independent dilation after <b>glycerol</b> <b>trinitrate</b> (GTN) was not different, but the FMD/GTN ratio was significantly lower in old subjects (49 ± 4 % vs. 37 ± 3 %; p < 0. 05), suggesting endothelial dysfunction. There were no differences in the numbers of circulating EPCs, defined as CD 34 /KDR or CD 133 /KDR double-positive cells in peripheral blood. In contrast, lower survival (39 ± 6 cells/mm 2 vs. 65 ± 11 cells/mm 2; p < 0. 05), migration (80 ± 12 vs. 157 ± 16 cells/mm 2; p < 0. 01), and proliferation (0. 20 ± 0. 04 cpm vs. 0. 44 ± 0. 07 cpm; p < 0. 05) implicate functional impairment of EPCs from old subjects. The FMD correlated univariately with EPC migration (r = 0. 52, p < 0. 05) and EPC proliferation (r = 0. 49, p < 0. 05). Multivariate analysis showed that both functional features represent independent predictors of endothelial function. ConclusionsMaintenance of vascular homeostasis by EPCs may be attenuated with age based on functional deficits rather than depletion of CD 34 /KDR or CD 133 /KDR cells...|$|E
40|$|The nitroaromatic {{compound}} 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluene (TNT) and the nitrate esters <b>glycerol</b> <b>trinitrate</b> (GTN) and {{pentaerythritol tetranitrate}} (PETN) are high explosives {{that have been}} produced {{on a massive scale}} for use in industrial and military applications. Through many years of production and use of these explosives, large quantities of toxic wastes have been generated, which has resulted in extensive contamination of soil and groundwater. These organic nitrate contaminants are highly recalcitrant and not normally found in the environment, thus classifying these compounds as xenobiotics. During this study, 36 bacterial species were isolated from contaminated soil and water that were able to utilize either TNT or PETN as a sole source of nitrogen. These were identified as Arthrobacter sp. (Pa- 3, Pb- 5, ST 12, ST 13, ST 14, ST 17, ST 23, ST 26), Pseudomonas sp. (ST 1, ST 2, ST 15, ST 18, ST 19,ST 22), Enterobacter sp. (ST 3, ST 5, ST 6, ST 8, ST 11), Klebsiella sp. (ST 4, ST 10, ST 16, ST 20, ST 21, ST 28, ST 29), Microbacterium sp. (ST 7, Pa- 4, Pb- 6,ST 9, ST 24, ST 25 ST 27,ST 30), and Achromobacter xylosoxidans (TNT 1, TNT 2). Six representative isolates were selected from the 36 isolates for further analysis of growth and enzyme activity. The isolates were found to catalyse the NAD(P) H- dependent reductive cleavage/breakdown of GTN and PETN in a manner that was similar to a class of previously described oxidoreuctase flavoproteins. These include Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE), PETN reductase, GTN reductase, xenobiotic reductases A and B and N-ethyl maleimide reductas. This is the first report of nitroaromatic degradation by Achromobacter xylosoxidans as per the author’s knowledge. The aim {{of this study was to}} isolate bacteria able to degrade TNT and PETN and to characterize these bacteria and the enzymes produced by them. Thirty-six bacteria were isolated from contaminated soil and water that were able to utilize either TNT or PETN as a sole source of nitrogen. Identification was based on 16 S rRNA gene sequences and biochemical testing. Studies investigating co-metabolism of the explosives in the presence of Tween- 80 was performed. Triton X- 100 was also evaluated as co-metabolic substrate. It was demonstrated that the addition of Tween- 80 as a co-substrate assisted in the co-metabolism of explosives and did improve the growth and therefore the degradation of the explosive. However, Triton X- 100 did not result in co-metabolism of the explosives since an improvement in growth was not observed. The information acquired in this study can assist in the further characterization, optimization and production of explosive-degrading enzymes...|$|E
