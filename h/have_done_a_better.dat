Comparing McCarthy to 'Dennis the Menace' of cartoon fame, the Vermonter {{delivered}} a scathing address in which he lambasted the Wisconsin man for dividing the nation.

He marveled {{at the way the}} Soviet Union was winning military successes in Asia without risking its own resources or men, and said this nation was witnessing 'another example of economy of effort...in the conquest of this country for communism.'

Smith {{has said that the}} title was intended to invoke witchcraft, that he concocted the word [...] "Enduction" [...] to suggest the album could be a listener's induction into the Fall and that [...] "Hex" [...] was a reference to this being the band's sixth release. His vocals are higher in the mix than on previous Fall releases and were described in 1982 by Sounds as [...] "emerg like a loudhailer from a fog of guitar scratch". The songs were deliberately produced in a raw and low-fi approach by Smith, Grant Showbiz and Richard Mazda in a sound described at the time as a [...] "well produced noise" [...] that was acceptable by Fall standards. Critic Mark Storace claimed that he [...] "could <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> job on a 4-track if I was pissed out of my head". Smith responded by saying that [...] "nowadays people just can't just shut up if they don't know what they're talking about."

Three songs were written at rehearsal and done the next time." ...|$|E

His rival, the French Florent Manaudou, won the gold beating the world record. Cielo also helped the Brazilian 4 × 50 metre mixed freestyle relay (formed by Cielo, João de Lucca, Etiene Medeiros and Larissa Oliveira) to win the bronze medal, beating the South American record with a time of 1:29.17, only 4 hundredths of Russia, which won the silver medal. In this race, Cielo opened with a time of 20.65, showing that could <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> time in the 50-metre freestyle final. On {{the last day of the}} competition, Cielo won the rematch against Manaudou, in the Men's 100 metre freestyle, where Manaudou was also favorite, but was defeated by Cielo, who won the gold with a time of 45.75. Cielo also closed the competition with a flourish, leading the Brazilian quartet to an unprecedented gold in the traditional Men's 4 × 100 metre medley relay, with a time of 3:21.14, South American record. Cielo took the relay in fourth place and surpassed everyone with an incredible split time of 44.67.|$|E

Cramer admitted {{that he can do}} better, and that he can change. He also pointed out the mass illusion on Wall Street and the finance industry in general that, in the words of former Merrill Lynch CEO Stanley O'Neal, [...] "fixed income and credit (i.e. the economy) were no longer cyclical in nature", and that this illusion had permeated Wall Street and all other industries connected to it, including the finance networks.|$|E

It so happened that she could not <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> thing, for Laurie came in so quietly she did not hear him, and as she stood at the distant window, with her head half turned and one hand gathering up her dress, the slender, white figure against the red curtains was as effective as a well-placed statue.|$|E
