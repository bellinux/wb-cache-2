5|$|Professor Nathan Katz {{writes of}} {{the analogy of}} a burning building, used by the Buddha in the Lotus Sutra, which casts {{religious}} language as imperative. In the analogy, a father sees his children {{at the top of}} a burning building. He persuades them to leave, but only by promising them toys if they leave. Katz argues that the message of the parable is not that the Buddha <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>telling</b> lies; rather, he believes that the Buddha was illustrating the imperative use of language. Katz believes that religious language is an imperative and an invitation, rather than a truth-claim.|$|E

500|$|In August 2012, the United States sanctioned Hezbollah for its alleged {{role in the}} war. General Secretary Nasrallah denied Hezbollah {{had been}} {{fighting}} {{on behalf of the}} Syrian government, stating in an 12 October 2012, speech that [...] "right from the start the Syrian opposition <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>telling</b> the media that Hizbullah sent 3,000 fighters to Syria, which we have denied". However, according to the Lebanese Daily Star newspaper, Nasrallah said in the same speech that Hezbollah fighters helped the Syrian government [...] "retain control of some 23 strategically located villages [...] inhabited by Shiites of Lebanese citizenship". Nasrallah said that Hezbollah fighters have died in Syria doing their [...] "jihadist duties".|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Will (Eric McCormack) accepts Karen's (Megan Mullally) {{invitation}} as her date, due to {{her husband}} being in prison, to her annual Valentine's Day party. It is there that Karen passes off Will as her [...] "gigolo," [...] after her rival Beverley Leslie (Leslie Jordan) teases her for being alone. Word gets around that Will is [...] "working" [...] for Karen for the weekend, which prompts many women asking for Will's [...] "services". Much to his dismay, Will believes he, a lawyer, is accepting legal clients. Karen finally reveals to Will that she <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>telling</b> everyone he is her gigolo.

500|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2008â€“09 NHL season, Panthers head coach Peter DeBoer, who first saw Horton play at seven years old, said about his hopes for Horton, [...] "If I'm looking for guys to do more, he wouldn't be at the top of the list. If he can give us 30-plus, I'd be happy with Nathan. There's a group of guys {{underneath}} him that I think can make a lot bigger jumps than I need out of Nathan Horton goal-wise." [...] Horton was also moved from his position of right wing to centre before the season. After playing a few games at centre, Horton said, [...] "It's not as easy as wing. You can play wing and all you have to concentrate on is getting the puck and shooting it. At center, you have more responsibilities." [...] Against the Nashville Predators on November 1, Horton played in his 300th career game, but failed to record a point. On November 26, Horton suffered a deep cut in his leg after it was stepped on by a skate. At the time of the injury, Horton had 6 goals and 7 assists. In early December, the Ottawa Sun reported that the Panthers might have been looking to trade Horton after he was reportedly unhappy playing for the team. Horton returned to the lineup on December 17 after missing eight games. After the game, Horton commented, [...] "I'm excited to play. It's kind of a different Panthers team than the past. It's really changed in a matter of a month. Things are going good now, and everybody's really buying into what Pete <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>telling</b> us all year." [...] On January 17, Horton recorded 3 assists to help the Panthers defeat Tampa Bay, 43. For the second time during the season, Horton's name came up in trade rumours, this time with the Chicago Blackhawks. In early March, days after the trade deadline, Horton suffered a finger injury that forced him to have surgery. He returned to the lineup on March 23, recording an assist in a Panthers loss to the Carolina Hurricanes. Horton ended the season with 22 goals and 23 assists in 67 games.|$|E

However, he said that Hezbollah fighters have gone to Syria independently and died there doing their [...] "jihadist duties". Hezbollah states it supports a process of reforms in Syria and is against what it calls US plots to destabilize and interfere in Syria.|$|E

[...] Unable to do so because of the promise he made to Frodo, he resolves to allow something he refers to only as [...] "She" [...] {{to take care of his}} problem. Sam realizes that the Ring masters Gollum more than hunger. Gollum persuades Frodo and Sam not to enter the Black Gate, where they would have been surely caught. Gollum tells them of a secret entrance to Mordor. Thus, they head south into Gondor's province of Ithilien, where they get to see one of the [...] "oliphants" [...] in a battle between the men of Gondor and the Haradrim. [...] They are then accosted by a group of Gondorian rangers led by Faramir, the brother of Boromir. Frodo learns from Faramir of Boromir's death. Faramir and the Rangers lead Frodo and Sam into a secret hideout where Sam accidentally reveals to Faramir that Frodo carries the One Ring.
