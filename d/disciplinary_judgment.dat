He fears that he has conceded too much to the papal party in not treating the Syllabus as ex cathedra; in allowing that the popes had been apt to claim dogmatic infallibility for wellnigh a thousand years; as to the ecumenicity of the Vatican council. Among other matters he was reading “the curious volumes of Discorsi di Pio IX., published at Rome, and he might find it his duty to write collaterally upon them.” This duty he performed with much fidelity in the Quarterly Review for January 1875. He is active in interest about translations; keen to enlist auxiliaries in every camp and all countries; delighted with all utterances from Italy or elsewhere that make in his direction, even noting with satisfaction that the agnostic Huxley was warm in approval. “I pass my days and nights,” he tells the Duke of Argyll (Dec. 19), “in the Vatican. Already the pope has given me two months of incessant correspondence and other hard work, and it may very well last two more. Nor is this work pleasant; but I am as far as possible from repenting of it, as no one else to whom the public would listen saved me the trouble. It is full of intense interest. Every post brings a mass of general reading, writing, or both. Forty covers {{of one kind or another}} to-day, and all my time is absorbed. But the subject is well worth the pains.” The Italians, Lord Granville told him, “generally approved, but were puzzled why you should have thought it necessary.” Retorts and replies arose in swarms, including one from Manning and another from Newman. He was accused by some of introducing a Bismarckian Kulturkampf into England, of seeking to recover his lost popularity by pandering to no-popery, of disregarding the best interests of the country for the sake of his own restoration to power.(323) ...|$|E
40|$|This {{present study}} {{investigated}} whether face-type (stereotypical or nonstereotypical) facilitates stereotype-consistent categorization and decision-making. Previous literature regarding adults has suggested an associative link between stereotypically Black facial features and assumed criminality. This study seeks to extend these findings by investigating whether the same heuristic processes that underpin biased decisions regarding adult phenotypic racially stereotypical features (e. g., broad nose, full lips) extend to children’s faces. That is, do the negative stereotypes (i. e., criminal Black male) that influence face-type judgments in adults extend to child face-type judgements as well. In two studies testing face-type categorization and <b>disciplinary</b> <b>judgments,</b> people {{were more likely}} to miscategorize children with stereotypical faces into negative roles more than positive roles. People {{were also more likely to}} increase their <b>disciplinary</b> <b>judgments</b> from one infraction to another for children with stererotypical faces compared to atypical faces. Results suggest that face-type cues do extend to children and also engender negative associations...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} lessons education should teach is discipline. While it does not appear as a subject, it underlies the whole educational structure. It is the training that develops the whole educational structure. It is the training that develops self control, character, orderliness, and efficiency. It is the key to good conduct and proper consideration for other people. In all disciplinary action teachers should be mindful {{of the fact that they}} are dealing with individual personalities. A child's personality, disposition, and personal characteristics should be given consideration before prescribing treatment. Each child is deserving of each teacher's very best thinking and most deliberate <b>judgment.</b> <b>Disciplinary</b> action should not be administered in such a way as to cause the child to lose status before his/her social group. Teachers will guard against making remarks to other pupils concerning the child's shortcomings or engage in discussions with a pupil in such a way as to reflect discredit upon the pupil before the others. All information concerning the pupil or his/her family background should be held in strictest confidence. In cases of insubordination or misconduct when ordinary and usual methods of correction ar...|$|R
