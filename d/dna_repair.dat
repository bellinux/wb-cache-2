40|$|MutLα {{is a key}} {{component}} of the <b>DNA</b> mismatch <b>repair</b> system in eukaryotes. The <b>DNA</b> mismatch <b>repair</b> system has several genetic stabilization functions. Of these functions, <b>DNA</b> mismatch <b>repair</b> is the major one. The loss of MutLα abolishes <b>DNA</b> mismatch <b>repair,</b> thereby predisposing humans to cancer. MutLα has an endonuclease activity that is required for <b>DNA</b> mismatch <b>repair.</b> The endonuclease activity of MutLα depends on the DQHA(X) 2 E(X) 4 E motif which {{is a part of the}} active site of the nuclease. This motif is also present in many bacterial MutL and eukaryotic MutLγ proteins, <b>DNA</b> mismatch <b>repair</b> system factors that are homologous to MutLα. Recent studies have shown that yeast MutLγ and several MutL proteins containing the DQHA(X) 2 E(X) 4 E motif possess endonuclease activities.

40|$|Lung {{cancer is}} {{the most common cause of}} death from cancer {{worldwide}} per year. Platinum-based combination chemotherapy is a main treatment of lung cancer. Cisplatin is adopted widely and used effectively in the first-line chemotherapy. Unfortunately, development of cisplatin resistance is a major obstacle to the success of lung caner. Cisplatin is a cell-cycle-non-specific cytotoxic drugs and its main target is DNA. Thus, defective <b>DNA</b> damage <b>repair</b> is one of the main mechanisms of cisplatin resistance. In this review, we will focus on the defective <b>DNA</b> damage <b>repair</b> in cisplatin resistance of lung cancer including nucleotide excision <b>repair,</b> <b>DNA</b> mismatch <b>repair,</b> <b>DNA</b> double-strand break <b>repair</b> and translesion synthesis...|$|R

40|$|In {{addition}} to their established role in <b>repairing</b> post-replicative <b>DNA</b> errors, <b>DNA</b> mismatch <b>repair</b> proteins contribute to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis {{in response to a}} wide range of exogenous DNA damage (e. g., alkylation-induced lesions). The role of <b>DNA</b> mismatch <b>repair</b> in response to ultraviolet-induced DNA damage has been historically controversial.

5|$|A {{distinct}} {{group of}} DNA-binding proteins is the DNA-binding proteins that specifically bind single-stranded DNA. In humans, replication protein A is the best-understood {{member of this}} family and is used in processes where the double helix is separated, including DNA replication, recombination, and <b>DNA</b> <b>repair.</b> These binding proteins seem to stabilize single-stranded DNA and protect it from forming stem-loops or being degraded by nucleases.|$|E
5|$|Damage to DNA {{alters the}} spatial {{configuration}} of the helix, and such alterations can be detected by the cell.

5|$|Enzymes called DNA ligases can rejoin cut {{or broken}} DNA strands.

40|$|Abstract: An Anacystis nidulans photolyase enzyme {{containing}} two chromophore cofactors was simulated for a photoreaction <b>DNA</b> <b>repairing</b> process via {{molecular dynamics}} (MD) method. A novel {{approach has been}} introduced for the electron transfer between the FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide; flavin) molecule and CPD (cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer). This approach involves four simulation stages with different charges for the FAD and CPD fragments and a role of a charged state of the active cofactor was qualified during the MD modeling. Observations show that flavin has actively participated in a charge transfer process, thereby involving the conformational changes of the DNA and CPD substrate fragment. The DNA conformation behavior has shown to correlate with the electron transfer from flavin to CPD. This is manifested on the similarities of the <b>DNA</b> <b>repairing</b> process by excision repair of the UV photoproducts...|$|R
5|$|The {{chemicals}} in the red-colored zone include an aromatic quinone, beta-carotene, and chlorophyll. The quinone is deep-red colored pigment chiodectonic acid, thought {{to function as a}} radiation protectant; in combination with beta-carotene, which has an established role in cellular <b>DNA</b> <b>repair</b> following exposure of the organism to UV-damage, such radiation protectants are often found in lichens and in extremophilic situations and are essential for survival.|$|E
5|$|Another way enzyme {{malfunctions}} {{can cause}} disease comes from germline mutations in genes coding for <b>DNA</b> <b>repair</b> enzymes. Defects in these enzymes cause cancer because cells are {{less able to}} repair mutations in their genomes. This causes a slow accumulation of mutations and results {{in the development of}} cancers. An example of such a hereditary cancer syndrome is xeroderma pigmentosum, which causes the development of skin cancers in response to even minimal exposure to ultraviolet light.|$|E
5|$|At {{the ends}} of the linear {{chromosomes}} are specialized regions of DNA called telomeres. The main function of these regions is to allow the cell to replicate chromosome ends using the enzyme telomerase, as the enzymes that normally replicate DNA cannot copy the extreme 3′ ends of chromosomes. These specialized chromosome caps also help protect the DNA ends, and stop the <b>DNA</b> <b>repair</b> systems in the cell from treating them as damage to be corrected. In human cells, telomeres are usually lengths of single-stranded DNA containing several thousand repeats of a simple TTAGGG sequence.|$|E

5|$|Genetic {{engineering}} is the modification of an organism's genome through biotechnology.

5|$|Alkaloids {{are derived}} from various amino acids. Over 3000 known {{alkaloids}} exist, examples include nicotine, caffeine, morphine, cocaine, colchicine, ergolines, strychnine, and quinine. Alkaloids have pharmacological effects on humans and other animals. Some alkaloids can inhibit or activate enzymes, or alter carbohydrate and fat storage by inhibiting the formation phosphodiester bonds involved in their breakdown. Certain alkaloids bind to nucleic acids and can inhibit synthesis of proteins and affect <b>DNA</b> <b>repair</b> mechanisms. Alkaloids can also affect cell membrane and cytoskeletal structure causing the cells to weaken, collapse, or leak, and can affect nerve transmission. Although alkaloids act on a diversity of metabolic systems in humans and other animals, they almost uniformly invoke an aversively bitter taste.|$|E
5|$|Checkpoint Proteins can be {{separated}} into four groups: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-like protein kinase, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-like group, two serine/threonine(S/T) kinases and their adaptors.

5|$|Despite the {{profound}} advances made over recent decades {{in our understanding}} of life's fundamental processes, some basic problems have remained unresolved. One of the major unresolved problems in biology is the primary adaptive function of sex, and particularly its key processes in eukaryotes of meiosis and homologous recombination. One view is that sex evolved primarily as an adaptation that promoted increased genetic diversity (see references e.g.). An alternative view is that sex is an adaptation for promoting accurate <b>DNA</b> <b>repair</b> in germ-line DNA, and that increased genetic diversity is primarily a byproduct that may be useful in the long run.

5|$|During early pregnancy, type 1 lobules {{quickly become}} type 2 lobules because {{of changes in}} {{estrogen}} and progesterone levels. Maturing into type 3 and then reaching full differentiation as type 4 lobules requires an increase of human placental lactogen (hPL) which occurs {{in the last few}} months of pregnancy. According to the abortionbreast cancer hypothesis, if an abortion were to interrupt this sequence then it could leave a higher ratio of type 2 lobules than existed prior to the pregnancy. Russo and Russo have shown that mature breast cells have more time for <b>DNA</b> <b>repair</b> with longer cell cycles, accounting for the slightly reduced risk of breast cancer for parous women against the baseline risk for women who have never conceived and those who have conceived and terminated their pregnancies.|$|E
5|$|Eukaryotic cells {{exposed to}} DNA {{damaging}} agents also activate important defensive pathways by inducing multiple proteins involved in <b>DNA</b> <b>repair,</b> cell cycle checkpoint control, protein trafficking and degradation. Such genome wide transcriptional response is very complex and tightly regulated, thus allowing coordinated global response to damage. Exposure of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to DNA damaging agents results in overlapping but distinct transcriptional profiles. Similarities to environmental shock response {{indicates that a}} general global stress response pathway exist {{at the level of}} transcriptional activation. In contrast, different human cell types respond to damage differently indicating an absence of a common global response. The probable explanation for this difference between yeast and human cells may be in the heterogeneity of mammalian cells. In an animal different types of cells are distributed among different organs that have evolved different sensitivities to DNA damage.|$|E
40|$|Unrepaired or inaccurately <b>repaired</b> <b>DNA</b> damage {{can lead}} to a range of cell fates, such as apoptosis, {{cellular}} senescence or cancer, depending on the efficiency and accuracy of <b>DNA</b> damage <b>repair</b> and on the downstream DNA damage signalling. <b>DNA</b> damage <b>repair</b> and signalling have been studied and modelled in detail separately, but it is not yet clear how they integrate with one another to control cell fate. In this study, we have created an integrated stochastic model of <b>DNA</b> damage <b>repair</b> by non-homologous end joining and of gamma irradiation-induced cellular senescence in human cells that are not apoptosis-prone. The integrated model successfully explains the changes that occur in the dynamics of <b>DNA</b> damage <b>repair</b> after irradiation. Simulations of p 53 /p 21 dynamics after irradiation agree well with previously published experimental studies, further validating the model. Additionally, the model predicts, and we offer some experimental support, that low-dose fractionated irradiation of cells leads to temporal patterns in p 53 /p 21 that lead to significant cellular senescence. The integrated model is valuable for studying the processes of DNA damage induced cell fate and predicting the effectiveness of DNA damage related medical interventions at the cellular level...|$|R
