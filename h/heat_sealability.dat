50|$|The {{biopolymer}} is {{also used}} in packaging manufacturing. Applications can be clear, opaque, flexible, or rigid. The biopolymer is similar to polystyrene, and exhibits tensile strength and modulus comparable to hydrocarbon-based thermoplastics. Much like polyester, it resists grease and oil, and offers flavor and odor barrier. Ingeo provides <b>heat</b> <b>sealability</b> at temperatures equivalent to polyolefin sealant resins.|$|E
50|$|A {{wide range}} of {{chemical}} treatments (in addition to corona) {{can be applied to}} PET film during its manufacture to help it adhere to various coatings, such as inks, adhesives, metalization, etc. Surface treatments can also be applied to incorporate properties like surface-slip and anti-static. Yet another approach is co-extrusion, where different polyester layers are combined to obtain properties like built-in <b>heat</b> <b>sealability,</b> rough surface with high clarity, etc.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{effects of}} {{nanoparticles}} (nano clay and nano silicon dioxide) on <b>heat</b> <b>sealability,</b> physicochemical, barrier, and mechanical properties of starch films were investigated. Starch films were prepared by casting method with addition of nanoparticles and plasticizers. All film properties were measured under standard conditions. Mechanical properties {{of all types}} of films were increased by incorporation of nanoparticles. Mungbean starch films showed 100 % increment in tensile strength by incorporation of nanoclay. Moisture content, water solubility, and WVP of all starch films decreased whereas decomposition temperature of the films was increased by incorporation of nanoparticles. All films were heat sealable, but nanoparticles-incorporated films exhibited better <b>heat</b> <b>sealability</b> than did control films. In summary, the type of starch governed the <b>heat</b> <b>sealability</b> but nanoparticles have potential to improve seal strength of starch films as well as other functional properties...|$|E
40|$|This study {{intended}} to provide biopolymer films used as food packaging, which will result in reducing environmental pollution produced by the activities of synthetic food packaging. We used zinc oxide nanorods (ZnO-nr) and we prepared nanocomposite films by means of solvent casting. FTIR and SEM were employed to characterize the final films. SEM images revealed that ZnO-nr particles were homogenously distributed throughout the film surface. The thermal, optical, and <b>heat</b> <b>sealability</b> properties of the films were also examined. Adding ZnO-nr significantly reduced oxygen permeability and <b>heat</b> <b>sealability.</b> The semolina films’ UV absorbance was highly impacted by the degree of ZnO-nr addition. The nanocomposite films absorbed above 90 % of the near infrared spectra. In addition, the zeta potential revealed the surface charge of ZnO-nr had a negative charge of about − 33. 9 mV...|$|E

Polylactide coating cardboard was prepared through the solvent coating, and study its packaging performance. In this study, chloroform is based solvent, ethanol or n-propanol as auxiliary solvents, poly (ethylene glycol) or poly caprolactone as plasticizer, and the water vapor permeability, oxygen permeability and <b>heat</b> <b>sealability</b> of polylactic acid coated cardboard...|$|E
30|$|Although <b>heat</b> <b>sealability</b> is an {{important}} factor for packaging materials, only a few studies have investigated this topic. The seal strength for gelatin matrices increased with lower concentrations of ZnO NRs (Figure  2 b). This result was attributed to the improvement of hydrogen and other bonds on the ZnO NR surface. However, the sealability of the films decreased with addition of higher percentage of ZnO NRs, possibly due to the reduction in flexibility and moisture content of the films.|$|E
40|$|KaptonFN film {{consists}} of a polyimide core that has been laminated with FEP fluoropolymer outer layers. This composite material's resistance to most chemical solvents, <b>heat</b> <b>sealability</b> and low moisture uptake make KaptonFN attractive as a packaging material for electronics and implantable devices. KaptonFN/Ti micro-joints were fabricated by using focused infrared laser irradiation. The micro-joints were mechanically debonded, and the KaptonFN/Ti interfaces were studied by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The locus of failure of the joints {{was found to be}} in the FEP layer near the interface with the Ti. The XPS results give evidence for the formation of Ti-F bond in the interfacial region...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{thermoplastic}} polyimide (PI) films (PI- 1 ~PI- 5) with intrinsic <b>heat</b> <b>sealability</b> have been synthesized by the high-temperature polycondensation reaction of asymmetrical 2, 3, 3 ꞌ, 4 ꞌ-oxydiphthalic anhydride (aODPA) and various aromatic diamines {{in order to}} meet the demands of advanced flexible copper clad laminates (FCCL). The derived PI resins had good solubility in polar aprotic solvents, such as N-methyl- 2 -pyrrolidone (NMP) and N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) at a solid content up to 20 wt%. Flexible and tough films could be cast from the PI/NMP solution and the films exhibited tensile strength higher than 83 MPa. Among the developed PIs, those derived from aODPA and benzimidazole-containing diamines, including PI- 4 from aODPA and 2 -(4 -aminophenyl) - 5 -aminobenzimidazole (4 APBI) and PI- 5 from aODPA and 2 -(3 -aminophenyl) - 5 -aminobenzimidazole (3 APBI) exhibited the highest thermal stability (glass transition temperatures, Tg > 340 °C), lowest linear coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE 1. 0 N/mm). Flexible copper clad laminate (FCCL) with no curling was successfully prepared from PI- 4 and copper foil...|$|E
40|$|The <b>heat</b> <b>sealability</b> of {{laminated}} {{films with}} linear {{low density polyethylene}} (LLDPE) and low density polyethylene (LDPE) as the sealant materials was investigated. A laboratory heat sealer was used to study the response of laminated films to temperature, time, and pressure. Platen temperature was confirmed as primary factor in controlling heat-seal strength. Dwell time must be sufficiently long to bring the interfacial temperature to a desired level. When the desired heat-seal strength has been achieved, further increase of dwell time did not improved heat-seal strength. Platen pressure had little effect above the level required to flatten the materials for good contact. Bar sealing process window for each sample were developed. The optimum combination of platen temperature and dwell time for each laminated film can be obtained in the respective process windows. Strength of heat-seal and its failure modes are closely related. Plateau initiation temperature closely corresponds to the final melting point of sealant materials. Relatively higher platen temperature was required to seal laminated films with lower thermal conductance. Required dwell time corresponds closely to the heat flow rate of bar sealing process. Laminated films made from extrusion lamination process provided lower level of achievable heat seal strength when compared with the laminated films made from dry-bond lamination proces...|$|E
40|$|Low-density {{polyethylene}} (LDPE) and polypropylene (PP) {{are widely}} used polymers in packaging industry. These polymers differ to one and other by their polymer structures: LPDE has long branched body, when PP is a linear polymer. Branched structure gives LDPE flexibility that PP lacks due to its high level of crystallization. The aim {{of this research was}} to compare these polymers in extrusion coating and find out if there are certain procedures in surface treatments that could improve PP’s properties in post-coating stage. For instance PP has high melting temperature and low surface energy that prevents its use in extrusion coating. In extrusion coating a thin film of the molten polymer is extruded though a flat tie and then pressed towards the substrate. The substrate in this study was paper and the studied treatments were flame, corona, and plasma focusing on heat sealing, hot tack, surface energy and water vapour transmission (WVTR). The study was divided into four different case studies: 1. The effect of flame treatment, 2. The barrier effect of plasma and corona, 3. The effect of the treatment combination, 4. The influence of time and conditions. In the results, it was shown that PP has better water vapour transfer resistance throughout the study points and in comparison to LDPE it also reacted more on the surface treatments in case of WVTR. LDPE had higher surface energy in nearly every study point despite the surface treatment and its reaction on treatments was greater. LDPE’s and PP’s <b>heat</b> <b>sealability</b> temperatures were relatively close to each other in treated study points, though LDPE’s reference value was remarkably lower. If flame treatment is combined with plasma or corona, the best results for both used polymers took place in the treatment order where the flame treatment was performed first: sealing temperature, surface energy and WVTR enhanced. In the study of time condition contact angles grow in logarithmic scale in both studied polymers and the highest growth happens in hotter and humid conditions. LDPE’s and PP’s sealing temperatures follow relatively similar curve in function of time. /Kir 1...|$|E
