25|$|In Klazomenai {{primarily}} amphoras and hydria {{were painted}} {{in the middle of}} the 6th century BC (c. 550 to 350 BC), as well as deep bowls with flat, angular-looking figures. The vessels are not very elegant in workmanship. Dancing women and animals were frequently depicted. Leading workshops were those of the Tübingen Painter, the Petrie Painter, and the Urla Group. Most of the vases were found in Naukratis and in Tell Defenneh, which was abandoned in 525 BC. Their origin was initially uncertain, but Robert Zahn identified the source by comparison with images on Klazomenian sarcophagi. The pottery was often decorated with sculptured women’s masks. Mythological scenes were rare; <b>fishscale</b> ornaments, rows of white dots, and stiff-looking dancing women were popular. The depection of a herold standing in front of a king and a queen is unique. In general, men were characterized by large, spade-shaped beards. Starting already in 600 BC and continuing to about 520 BC rosette cups, successor to the eastern Greece bird cups, were produced, probably in Klazomenai.|$|E

The work done by other researchers on hot or cold rolled sheet steels over the last few decades has been reviewed.

The <b>fishscaling</b> resistance of the steels can be correlated to the effective hydrogen diffusion coefficient, and a model of correlation between the effective hydrogen diffusion coefficient and the volume fraction of the precipitates was established and verified.

40|$|When {{porcelain}} enamels or vitreous-type ceramic coatings {{are applied}} to ferrous metals, there {{is believed to be}} an evolution of hydrogen gas both during and after the firing operation. At elevated temperatures rapid evolution may result in blistering while if hydrogen becomes trapped in the steel during the rapid cooling following the firing operation gas pressures may be generated at the coating-metal interface and flakes of the coating literally blown off the metal. To determine experimentally the relative importance of the principal sources of the hydrogen causing the defects, a procedure was devised in which heavy hydrogen (deuterium) was substituted in turn for regular hydrogen in each of five possible hydrogen-producing operations in the coating process. The findings of the study were as follows: (1) the principal source of the defect-producing hydrogen was the dissolved water present in the enamel frit that was incorporated into the coating. (2) the acid pickling, the milling water, the chemically combined water in the clay, and the quenching water were all minor sources of defect-producing hydrogen under the test conditions used. Confirming experiments showed that <b>fishscaling</b> could be eliminated by using a water-free coating...|$|R

All except the Blaker's Park and Patcham clock towers are Grade II-listed. John Johnson's design for the Jubilee Clock Tower of 1888 combined the Classical style with Baroque motifs and some High Gothic elements. Pink granite, a copper <b>fishscale</b> dome, Corinthian columns and mosaic portraits of Royal Family members combine to give a [...] "supremely confident and showy" [...] design. [...] The tower has withstood fierce criticism and calls for its demolition, {{and is now a}} widely appreciated landmark. Francis May's [...] "pompous" [...] clock tower, built in the newly laid out Preston Park in 1891–92, also combined some Classical and Gothic elements—this time using terracotta, pale brick and stone—but its style is closest in spirit to Neo-Flemish Renaissance. A copper dome with a weather-vane tops the four-stage tower. A London architect, Llewellyn Williams, won the commission for the Queen's Park clock tower in 1915; his three-stage design, on high ground, incorporates Portland stone (partly rusticated) and red brick, and also has a copper roof. Blaker's Park, northeast of Preston Park, was laid out in 1893 when Sir John Blaker (later 1st Baron of Brighton) donated land. [...] He also paid £1,000 towards the construction in 1896 of a [...] red-brick and iron clock tower with a pale green exterior. [...] It is topped by a cupola with a dolphin-shaped weather-vane, and bears Blaker's monogram. Patcham's clock tower, built of pale stone in an International/Modernist style, stands on a green amidst 1930s housing and forms an important landmark.|$|E
