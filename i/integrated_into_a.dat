5|$|The Manche Ch'ol were <b>integrated</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> {{regional}} trade network that included their Itza and Lakandon Ch'ol neighbours, and involved {{the exchange of}} Manche produce such as cacao, annatto and vanilla for salt, the only Maya source of which was controlled by the Itza after the Spanish conquest of the province of Acalan. This trade monopoly was maintained by force {{on the part of}} the Itza, who vigorously ensured that the Manche Ch'ol remained subservient to them. After the Manche towns on the coast of Belize fell under Spanish control in the 16th century, they continued to have close links with the independent inland Manche settlements. Trade continued and intermarriage was common. The towns in the Cancuén River drainage traded via land and riverine routes with both the independent Itza (notably with Nojpetén) and with colonial Verapaz (principally with Cobán and Cahabón).|$|E

5|$|The medieval city walls, {{built in}} several stages between the 13th and the 16th century, were torn down after the French {{annexation}} in the 17th century. However, four towers escaped destruction. The Tour des Sorcières ("witches' tower"), which served as a gate and a jail, is the tallest. The Tour de l'Horloge ("clock tower") was also originally part of a gate. The clock and the elaborate roof were added in 1614. Two much smaller towers can also be seen, one near the Ill river and another <b>integrated</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> later house. All these remains date from the 13th century.|$|E
5|$|To {{the west}} of the nave is a small narthex, which is topped by an unusual {{rectangular}} tower. The tower was used either as a bell tower or watchtower, or possibly both. It was accessible via wooden ladders on the inside and the outside. It features four wide vaulted windows in its upper part and a rectangular dome covered with roof tiles. According to art historian Robert G. Ousterhout, the tower of the Church of the Holy Mother of God is the earliest example of a belfry <b>integrated</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> church building and arranged above the narthex in Balkan architecture. This design would later establish itself as standard in the Balkans. The construction of an integrated tower has been attributed to either Western European or oriental (Syriac or Armenian) influences.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{a decline}} in social {{mobility}} for those of less prominent clans, the local elites became far more <b>integrated</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> nationwide upper class social structure during the Eastern Han period, thus expanding the classification of who belonged to the upper class. The emerging gentry class—which became fully consolidated during the Eastern Han—consisted of unemployed scholars, teachers, students, and government officials. These men, although geographically separated and mired in local activities, started to view themselves as participants in wider national affairs of politics and scholarship. They recognized shared values of filial piety, deference, and emphasizing study in the Five Classics over holding public office. Emperors Yuan and Cheng were forced to abandon their resettlement schemes for officials and their families around the royal tombs settlement in 40 BCE and 15 BCE, respectively; unlike the days of Emperor Wu, historian Cho-Yun Hsu asserts {{that at this point}} officials and scholars had so much influence in both local and national-level politics that to forcibly relocate them became unthinkable.|$|E

5|$|Fenix is a praetor {{within the}} {{military}} of the Khalai. Bill Roper voices Fenix in both StarCraft and Brood War. A templar and {{an old friend of}} Tassadar's, Fenix is a powerful and cunning leader, but remains distrustful towards the motives of the ruling judicator caste. Under the command of Aldaris, Fenix helps defend Aiur from the Zerg invasion, but eventually falls in the battle of Antioch when his position is overwhelmed by Zerg and his psi-blades lose power. Nevertheless, Fenix is retrieved and <b>integrated</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> dragoon, a mechanical fire support unit designed to allow incapacitated warriors to continue military service. Fenix allies his templar forces with Tassadar's upon the schism between Tassadar and the Protoss government, later leading a task force against the Overmind's outer defenses, facilitating Zeratul's assassination of a number of cerebrates and ultimately the death of the Overmind itself. Over this time, Fenix develops a strong friendship with Tassadar's Terran companion Jim Raynor.|$|E
5|$|Durkheim {{believed}} {{there was more to}} suicide than extremely personal individual life circumstances: for example, a loss of a job, divorce, or bankruptcy. Instead, he took suicide and explained it as a social fact instead of a result of one’s circumstances. Durkheim believed that suicide was an instance of social deviance. Social deviance being any transgression of socially established norms. He created a normative theory of suicide focusing on the conditions of group life. The four different types of suicide that he proposed are egoistic, altruistic, anomic, and fatalistic. He began by plotting social regulation on the x-axis of his chart, and social integration on the y-axis. Egoistic suicide corresponds to a low level of social integration. When one is not well <b>integrated</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> social group it can lead to a feeling that he or she has not made a difference in anyone’s lives. On the other hand, too much social integration would be altruistic suicide. This occurs when a group dominates the life of an individual to a degree where they feel meaningless to society. Anomic suicide occurs when one has an insufficient amount of social regulation. This stems from the sociological term anomie meaning a sense of aimlessness or despair that arises from the inability to reasonably expect life to be predictable. Lastly, there is fatalistic suicide, which results from too much social regulation. An example of this would be when one follows the same routine day after day. This leads to he or she believing there is nothing good to look forward to. Durkheim suggested this was the most popular form of suicide for prisoners.|$|E

Firstly, the paper concentrates on a general overview of CIMO and describes the constitution and functions of the CIMO architecture. Secondly, the paper presents the definition of the CIMO component concept and addresses how CIMO facilitates users to establish scalable component-based applications and how CIMO supports the synchronous and asynchronous communication between components. Thirdly, the paper explains how CIMO sets up the deployment of components and processes after users have developed components based on CIMO specifications. </p...|$|R
