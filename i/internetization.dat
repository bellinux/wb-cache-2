40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{exploratory}} {{review of the}} literature with particular reference to business organizations. Today, we observe in university research and in enterprises practices that looking for information, often converges with the use of internet. We intend to show in this paper historical influences and scientific foundations over which authors build modern looking for information. Both in companies and in scholar situations, we notice a lack of methodology in how to handle the problem of looking for information, an <b>internetization</b> of the looking for, and a Googlelization, mostly based on the paradigm of information acceptance. How can we define an efficient and effective looking for information? We present a new approach to consider efficiency and effectiveness in looking for information...|$|E

40|$|The {{progressive}} {{process of}} <b>internetization</b> leads the audience {{little by little}} to setting aside traditional media of today's every day: dailies, radio and television. The evolution of media use leads to thorough consideration of the future that awaits both media owners and users. Trying to show potential concerns, the author refers to the classic theory of agenda setting (Lazarsfeld & Merton, 1948; McCombs & Shaw, 1972). American research conducted in 1999 showed distinctive concentration of Internet traffic; 80 % of site visits were made to just 0, 5 % of websites, such as Yahoo!, Excite, eBay et al. (Waxman 1999). A similar tendency emerged in 2004, during Polish research on Internet traffic (Meller 2004). The paper focuses on the electronic media which may already be an important field of agenda setting research. The analysis concerns the example of Polish Internet users and Polish e-media. As the paper shows, among the latter, a particularly important role is played by portals – the places where beginners usually start their cyberspace adventure and where, paradoxically, they are encouraged to stay most of the time. Key words: Agenda setting theory, internet portals, national enclaves over cyberspace...|$|E

We would like to learn what did the printed newspaper editors take to internetisation is not destroyed and to ensure a good position in the media market. In this work we're trying to show the example of the Czech print media: on the magazine and on the newspaper. The work is divided into two parts: theoretical and practical. The first part covers various theoretical considerations modern theorists <b>internetization</b> to understand as much as possible. Than we dedicated to the history of the formation and evolution internteu {{in the context of the}} Internet on the territory of the Czechoslovakia and later the Czech Republic. Following basic characteristics of network media, or by other authors also new media. Then attention is paid to interactivity as a key attribute, and the most advanced network media. This is followed by a description of some possible approaches to the conveniences of digital technologies and their use in a wide context when working with information, including the potential risks and dangers that modern communications technology eventually could lead to or have even caused. The practical part of the work focuses mainly on the editors of Hospodářské noviny and Respekt with the aim of mapping procedures that the two [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Information {{technologies}} play a {{very important}} role in modernizing Russia's economy and society as whole. Its competitive advantage lies in the availability of highly educated labour resources. Russia accounts for approximately 9 % of researchers in the world as opposed to a share of about 0. 3 % in the world innovation market. Our approach is based on identifying ways to set up IT innovation centres and create an organizational and economic mechanisms making possible the transfer of new technologies to production processes and the creation of tools for innovative management. In the markets of high technology Russia will concentratie on software tools for IT security, applied modelling information systems, various types of software, and cryptographic systems, some types of specialized computing systems. In the Education Project two main mechanisms of systemic change are envisaged: to identify and support leading higher educational institutions; to introduce on a grand scale new knowledge-management methods and put mechanisms into practice. Among the main intentions of the Education Project the following should be mentioned: the modernization of its material-technical base, the <b>internetization</b> of education, the expansion of innovation centres on the pattern of universities and scientific and research institutes, the creation of Russian "Siliceous Valley"- Skolkovo complementary clusters of small, innovative companies. In the framework of the Health Care 2020 Programme. Activities are underway to introduce a Federal Register of the most widespread diseases, to operate waiting lists of those who need high technology medical help, and to centralize access to the common database of normative and reference information. Drafts of their electronic presentation formats are developed on the basis of international ISO standards. An Internet market for various types of medical and information services is being set up; telemedicine technologies are being taken into account. The social orientation of IT development will improve educational and health care systems, accelerate progress in extending the number of qualified professionals in IT (according to experts, the demand for these in 2012 will increase by up to 550, 000 persons, and even then the country's demand will only be satisfied to the degree of 15 %). A model enabling Russia to enter the group of countries with a high development of intellectual potential demands more intensive introduction of IT in modernization of Russian society.

Among the countries of Latin America, Cuba shows the best performance in education as per UNESCO (2009). In the 1990 s, Cuba entered a period of change and transition followed by the collapse of the USSR, its closest international partner. This transition has largely been driven by globalization through tourism, neoliberal policies, double currency, technology, etc. It has been argued in the literature that these changes have made the teachers and the educational system vulnerable. I take these claims as a starting point and further explore how the changes in the Cuban society have affected teachers and the Cuban educational system as a whole in the post-Fidel period. Through the global architecture of education theoretical framework, I explore the current features of the Cuban educational system. Further, through the concept of transition I discuss the implications of the most recent changes in the status of the teacher profession. I argue, among other things, that throughout the post-Fidel transition there has been a higher exposure to Western values, for instance, as a result of <b>internetization.</b> Western values seem to come in conflict with the Cuban anti-imperialistic and anti-capitalistic ideologies traditionally embedded in the educational system. The discrepancy already existing between what is taught at school by teachers and what is out there in the reality increases. This puts teachers whose task is to drive this ideological education in a challenging position. Nevertheless, it seems that the Cuban educational system keeps being rather deviant from the features embedded in the global architecture of education; starting from its state-generated social capital, which does not reproduce the status quo and relieves the school system from its classist nature. At the same time, new and old factors such as spreading of internet and tourism are having more impact in the island and Cuba is challenged to reach a compromise with these factors in order to not sacrifice its educational principles and successes. One of my key findings is that it appears that teachers’ economic condition largely affect their position since their condition often leads them to turn into the illegal or gray area. The data was gathered during my fieldwork, through a qualitative-focused ethnographic research, where I conducted informal interviews with teachers and “knowledgeable people” about the teacher profession...|$|E
