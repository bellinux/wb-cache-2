5|$|After rejoining the Emperor at Champaubert, Nansouty {{took part}} to the Battle of Montmirail, where he was at first {{instructed}} to protect the artillery. He then joined in the attack of the Guard infantry on the farm of Ėpine-au-Bois, where he suddenly wheeled left with his men and fell upon unprepared enemy infantry, charging home, routing these troops and subsequently pursuing the fugitives. This combined attack of the Guard resulted in {{a great number of}} prisoners and captured enemy guns, with Nansouty receiving a light wound in the process. A part of his men then took {{part to the}} Battle of Château-Thierry, where the Emperor ordered the Guard cavalry to make a turning move against the enemy left, and where Nansouty's subordinates General Letort and Colonel Curély brilliantly broke several enemy squares. Then, on 14 February, Nansouty personally led a brilliant charge at the Battle of Vauchamps, where he supported Grouchy in a cavalry action that decided the battle. Charging Blücher's men from the front, Nansouty allowed Grouchy to magnificently fall behind the enemy columns, which they both then sabred and crushed, with the Guard cavalry subsequently participating in a highly successful pursuit. Enemy losses reached a staggering 9,000-10,000 casualties, with 25 cannons lost. The Emperor was radiant following this battle, but, by nightfall, his mood changed when he found out of the loss of some Guard horse artillerymen. These men had been captured during their march and it was reported that their capture resulted from General <b>Guyot</b> (one of Nansouty's subordinates) failing to provide an escort and a guide for them. In Nansouty's presence, a fuming Napoleon summoned <b>Guyot</b> and then chastised him for the repeated losses in cannon during the previous battles, as well as for various other shortcomings, such as failing to properly escort the Emperor. After an angry tirade, Napoleon promptly axed <b>Guyot</b> and announced to Nansouty that General Exelmans would replace <b>Guyot</b> at the helm of his Old Guard heavy cavalry. This episode apparently strained relations between Emperor Napoleon and General Nansouty.|$|E
5|$|Nansouty's final {{campaign}} {{took place}} in 1814 on French soil, under bleak circumstances for the French, who saw huge Coalition armies invade France {{at the beginning of}} that year. During this campaign, his command, 5,000 Horse Guards, included the 1st and 2nd Chevau-légers Lanciers regiments, under General Édouard Colbert, the Chasseurs à Cheval, under General Laferrière, the Grenadiers à Cheval under General <b>Guyot,</b> the Dragons, under General Letort, as well as the entire Guard horse artillery.|$|E
5|$|Seamounts {{can form}} {{in a wide}} variety of tectonic settings, {{resulting}} in a very diverse structural bank. Seamounts come {{in a wide variety}} of structural shapes, from conical to flat-topped to complexly shaped. Some are built very large and very low, such as Koko <b>Guyot</b> and Detroit Seamount; others are built more steeply, such as Loihi Seamount and Bowie Seamount. Some seamounts also have a carbonate or sediment cap.|$|E
5000|$|Another factor {{contributing}} to the <b>guyots</b> being underwater {{has to do with}} the oceanic ridges, such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in the Atlantic Ocean. Mid-ocean ridges gradually spread apart over time, due to molten lava being pushed up under the surface of the earth and creating new rock. As the mid-ocean ridges spread apart, the <b>guyots</b> move with them, thus continually sinking deeper into the depths of the ocean. Thus, the greater amount of time that passes, the deeper the <b>guyots</b> become. [...] Although <b>guyots</b> can be hundreds of millions of years old, there have been some recently discovered <b>guyots</b> that were only formed within the last 1 million years, including Bowie Seamount on the coast of British Columbia, Canada.|$|R

40|$|This paper generalizes both {{original}} data and all available materials obtained by home and foreign researchers when studying <b>guyots</b> of the Magellan seamounts. The Magellan seamounts represent an extended arc-like chain of seamounts, mainly <b>guyots</b> within the middle {{part of the}} East-Mariana Trough. The <b>guyots</b> rise above the relatively flat floor of the East-Mariana Trough with depths about 5500 - 6000 m to the height up to 4500 - 4800 m and reach depth level from 1300 to 1200 m. In 1980 s- 1990 s the Magellan seamounts become objects of permanent studies for both home and foreign researchers. First of all it is connected {{with the fact that}} considerable accumulations of Fe/Mn crusts and nodules were found at slopes and tops of the Magellan seamounts. Though having some similar features, the <b>guyots</b> of the Magellan seamounts differ considerably in their geological structure, time of formation and duration of volcanic activity. They were studied rather non-uniformly. The Ita-Maitai, Dalmorgeo, Roskomnedra, Vulkanolog, TIG, Hemler <b>guyots</b> and the Himu seamount were studied in detail, while the Nakhodka, IMGiG, TOI, DVGI <b>guyots</b> and the D- 4 and Golden Dragonseamounts are less studied.

5|$|Day {{continued}} {{to take on}} challenging and difficult projects. He had already printed the first English book of church music in 1560. In 1567, Matthew Parker, the Archbishop of Canterbury, commissioned Day to print a collection of writings attributed to the tenth-century Aelfric of Eynsham. For this work, Day, known for his fine and varied fonts, had the first-ever font of Anglo-Saxon type cut. The cost was borne by Parker, perhaps Day's most important patron. The font may have been designed by François <b>Guyot,</b> a French type-founder known to have worked for Day and lived in his household. Day used the same font to print Lambarde's Archaionomia (a collection of Anglo-Saxon laws) in 1568. In 1570, he printed Billingsley and Dee's English Euclid, which included folding and movable diagrams—one of the first printed books ever to do so. In the same year, he printed Ascham's Scholemaster.|$|E
5|$|The Hawaiian–Emperor {{seamount}} chain {{is a series}} of volcanoes and seamounts extending across the Pacific Ocean. The chain has been produced by the movement of the ocean crust over the Hawaii hotspot, an upwelling of hot rock from the Earth's mantle. As the oceanic crust moves the volcanoes farther away from their source of magma, their eruptions become less frequent and less powerful until they eventually cease to erupt altogether. At that point erosion of the volcano and subsidence of the seafloor cause the volcano to gradually diminish. As the volcano sinks and erodes, it first becomes an atoll island and then an atoll. Further subsidence causes the volcano to sink below the sea surface, becoming a seamount and/or a <b>guyot.</b> This list documents the most significant volcanoes in the chain, ordered by distance from the hotspot; however, there are many others that have yet to be properly studied.|$|E
5|$|The {{oldest and}} most heavily eroded part of the chain are the Emperor seamounts, which are 39 to 85million years in age. The Emperor and Hawaiian chains are {{separated}} by a large L-shaped bend that causes the orientations of the chains to differ by about 60°. This bend was long attributed to a relatively sudden change {{in the direction of}} plate motion, but research conducted in 2003 suggests that it was the movement of the hotspot itself that caused the bend. The issue is still currently under debate. All of the volcanoes {{in this part of the}} chain have long since subsided below sea level, becoming seamounts and guyots (see also the seamount and <b>guyot</b> stages of Hawaiian volcanism). Many of the volcanoes are named after former emperors of Japan. The seamount chain extends to the West Pacific, and terminates at the Kuril–Kamchatka Trench, a subduction zone at the border of Russia.|$|E

5|$|The Bordeaux wine region {{accounts}} for more than 60% of the Cabernet Sauvignon grown in France. Outside of Bordeaux, Cabernet Sauvignon is found in varying quantities throughout Le Midi and in the Loire Valley. In general, Cabernet Sauvignon wines are lighter and less structured, drinkable much earlier than Bordeaux wine. In the southwest French appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOCs) of Bergerac and Buzet it is used to make rosé wine. In some regions it is used to add flavor and structure to Carignan while it is blended with Négrette in Gaillac and Fronton as well as Tannat in Madiran. In Provence, the grape had some presence in the region in the mid 19th century, when viticulturist Jules <b>Guyot</b> recommended it as a blending partner with Syrah. In recent years, several Midi wine estates, such as Mas de Daumas Gassac have received international acclaim for their Cabernet Sauvignon blended in Hérault, with Rhône grapes like Syrah. It is often made as a single varietal in the vin de pays of the Languedoc. The influence of Australian flying winemakers has been considerable in how Cabernet Sauvignon is treated by some Languedoc wine estates, with some producers making wines that can seem like they are from the New World. Overall, the grape has not exerted it dominance of the region, generally considered less ideally situated to the dry climate than Syrah. The Languedoc producers who give serious consideration to Cabernet Sauvignon, generally rely on irrigation to compensate for the climate.|$|E

25|$|On {{the morning}} of 1 November, the Prussians left Waren. Blücher moved to the {{northeast}} via Hohen Wangelin, covered by a rear guard under General-Major Friedrich Gottlieb von Oswald. Winning marched east along {{the north shore of}} several lakes, covered by Oberst von Pletz's rear guard. That morning in Waren, Colonel Claude-Étienne <b>Guyot</b> with the 400-strong 22nd Chasseurs à Cheval from Soult's corps surrounded and captured Major Schmude and 170 dragoons. However, when <b>Guyot</b> tried to advance from the town, Pletz counterattacked with 850 horsemen of the Köhler Hussar Regiment # 7. For a loss of only one killed, 15 wounded, and 10 missing, the Prussian hussars threw Guyot's cavalry back into Waren and freed Schmude and his men.

25|$|The Beaujolais {{region has}} one of the highest vine density ratios of any major {{worldwide}} wine region, with anywhere from 9000 to 13,000 vines per hectare. Most vines are trained in the traditional gobelet style, where the spurs of the vines are pushed upwards and arranged in a circle, resembling a chalice. This method has its roots in the Roman style of vine training and has only recently begun to fall out of favor for the <b>guyot</b> method which involves taking a single or double spur and training it out horizontally. Harvest usually occurs in late September and is almost universally done by hand rather than with the use of mechanical harvesters.

Except for the guns which were unable to cross the stream, Heidenreich's troops moved east and seized Marchais at about 11:00 am. More French artillery having arrived in the interval, Napoleon ordered Ricard to attack Marchais at noon. A bitter struggle for Marchais raged for two hours, with the Russians retaining control of the village. Napoleon ordered an artillery bombardment {{while he waited for}} Michel's Old Guard division to march forward from Montmirail. At 2:00 pm the emperor ordered an attack on Sacken's left flank. Four of Friant's Old Guard battalions marched west along the highway toward Haute-Épine dairy farm, supported on their right by seven squadrons of Gardes d'Honneur. At the same time, Claude-Étienne <b>Guyot</b> led four Guard cavalry squadrons around the Russian left flank.

40|$|Cainozoic deep-sea {{ostracod}} assemblages {{from the}} summits of Mid-Pacific <b>guyots</b> point {{to high levels}} of endemism possibly {{as a result of their}} bathymetric separation from the surrounding sea floor. However, the interpretation of these fossil assemblages is hampered by the paucity of comparative material from surrounding non-guyot sites. Fifteen ostracod assemblages from DSDP Site 463 (Late Cretaceous-Pleistocene) were studied to compare with those from nearby <b>guyots.</b> Three distinct faunal assemblages are recognised at Site 463 : Assemblage A (Maastrichtian-Eocene), Assemblage B (Oligocene-Upper Miocene) and Assemblage C (Upper Miocene-Pleistocene) although the palaeoenvironmental significance of these units is unclear. Sixty-two ostracod species are identified, the thirteen most abundant are discussed in the taxonomic section, five of which are described as new. Between 30 and 100 % of the species encountered in each sample are considered as endemic to Site 463, while some of the remaining species were previously thought to be endemic to individual <b>guyots.</b> Similarly high levels of endemism on nearby <b>guyots</b> probably reflect an incomplete knowledge of deep-sea ostracod faunas rather than the establishment of geographically or bathymetrically restricted populations. The presence of globally pandemic and geographically widespread taxa on sites such as the Mid-Pacific Mountains, surrounded by abyssal depths which lie below the CCD, indicates that some faunal exchange or migration of ostracods does take place. This must be achieved within the intermediate waters and probably occurs passively...|$|R
40|$|Many of the <b>guyots</b> of the Northwestern Pacific Ocean {{are capped}} by {{sequences}} of uncemented pelagic carbonate. Examination {{of three of}} these pelagic caps from Limalok, Lo-En, and Wodejebato <b>guyots</b> in the Marshall Islands indicates that sediment accumulation throughout the late Paleogene and late Cenozoic was characterized by episodes of deposition during the earliest Miocene, late early to early middle Miocene, late middle Miocene, mid-Pliocene, and Quaternary, separated by periods of little or no accumulation. The Miocene record consists of extensively winnowed foraminifer oozes, which suggest relatively energetic currents in the intermediate waters. The Pliocene and Quaternary sequences contain finer grained nannofossil oozes, suggesting lower intermediate-water current velocities. Comparison with <b>guyots</b> from more northern locations indicates a highly predictable relationship between modern latitude and pelagic cap thickness, with thickness decreasing toward the north.
