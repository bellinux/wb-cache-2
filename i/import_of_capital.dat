Furthermore, while <b>import</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> goods and raw materials had significantly positive effects on exports in almost all industries, competitiveness had significant positive effect only in the lighter industries (food and beverages, and textiles), productivity growth did not have significant positive effect in any industry, and firm size had significant positive effect on exports only in petro-chemical industry for firms of size higher than a threshold level. ...|$|E

On the impact of import competition, the study found that it depends on domestic market structure. It promotes investment in R&D only when the market structure is highly concentrated otherwise it has negative effect. Thus the paper brings out the conditional nature of trade’s impact on R&D investment.

Foreign borrowings by Indian corporates are characterised {{by a large}} number of companies accessing international capital markets for small size loans. The policy framework on foreign commercial borrowings has been effective in achieving a balanced maturity profile as also in channelising funds to productive sectors. It is observed that foreign borrowings by the corporates and <b>import</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> goods display a close positive relationship. Since capital goods import is closely related to growth in industrial production, it implies that the demand for foreign borrowings by the corporates is generated by the underlying pace of real activity. The estimated error correction model revealed that Indian corporates ’ long-run demand for overseas commercial borrowings is predominantly influenced by the pace of domestic real activity, followed by the interest rate differentials between the domestic and international markets (indicating arbitrage) and the credit conditions. The real variable dominates the price variable in driving the demand for overseas commercial borrowings. JEL Classification...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} {{characteristic of}} the role of foreign trade in the technological catch-up of countries is the complementary nature of technological change and human capital formation. In this context, the level of education is likely to have a crucial impact on total factor productivity because it determines the capacity of an economy to carry out technological innovation, and to adopt and to implement efficiently technology from abroad. However, the role of human capital as a pre requisite for technology absorption although theoretically acknowledged has been empirically neglected. One of the main problems with empirical studies in this domain is that they do not clearly test the mechanisms through which trade, namely the <b>import</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> goods, affects total factor productivity or, roughly the level of technological development of a given country. Through cointegration techniques, we demonstrate the relevance of the technological absorption hypothesis. We show that the interaction between human capital and (lagged) machinery imports – that is, the technological absorption capability - is the most critical determinant of Portuguese long-run total factor productivity.

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{economic}} reforms in general and subsequent wave of M&A in particular, this paper attempts to {{examine the impact of}} M&A on the export competitiveness of firms in the Indian manufacturing sector. By using a panel dataset of 33 industries from the period of 2000 - 01 to 2007 - 08, it is found that, the wave of M&A has enhanced the export competitiveness of firms. The industries with larger number of M&A have greater penetration in the international market. The other factors that have significantly contributed to export competitiveness include the presence of MNCs and import of foreign technology. Export competiveness is higher in the industries that have larger presence of MNCs and greater foreign technology purchase intensity. On the other hand, industries with higher capital intensity or greater selling efforts by firms have limited penetration in the international market. However, this paper did not find any significant influence of market concentration, competition from imports, in-house efforts, or profitability on export competitiveness of firms. Therefore, the findings from this paper have important policy implications in relation to the regulation of M&A and entry of MNCs as well as the <b>import</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> goods...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{permanent}} real depreciation on a country's capital stock is uncertain. Whether total capital stock rises or falls {{depends on how}} depreciation affects aggregate demand, the real interest rate, and especially the <b>import</b> content <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> goods. In the long run, the capital stock {{can be expected to}} rise in traded goods and fall in nontraded goods. Despite this long-run ambiguity, anticipated changes in real exchange rate have a predictable effect on the dynamics <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> accumulation. They provide an incentive for speculative rellocation of investment over time, so they can greatly distort the timing of investments. In the framework of this paper, the time profile of investment is related to how financially open an economy is and to the <b>import</b> content <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> goods. When a real depreciation is expected, an investment boom is likely to develop if the <b>import</b> content <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> goods is high relative to the degree <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> mobility: the anticipated depreciation promotes flight into foreign goods.
