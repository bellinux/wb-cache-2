50|$|Northern Edge 2007 {{combined}} with Alaska Shield took place from April 30 - May 17, 2007. Its purpose was for local, state, federal, DoD, and non-governmental organizations and agencies to exercise {{how to respond}} to a national crisis in a full range of training scenarios. This was the largest response readiness exercise {{in the history of the}} State of Alaska, involving more than 75 agencies and approximately 7,000 people. Military and civilian participants worked together to <b>intercept</b> <b>aircraft,</b> <b>respond</b> to attacks on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System and the North Pole Industrial Complex, and conducted medical evacuations after mass casualty incidents.|$|R
50|$|Finally, the {{introduction}} of the first effective anti-aircraft missiles dramatically changed the game. Radars for plotting an air intercept were generally made as long-range as possible in order to give the operators ample time to guide <b>intercept</b> <b>aircraft</b> onto the target as it moved across the display. This led to low blip/scan ratios and inaccurate prediction of aircraft trajectories. This had been compounded by the difficulty of quickly scrambling <b>intercept</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In September 1982, [...] - {{the third}} Kiev-class carrier - was commissioned. By now the V/STOL {{technique}} had been well practised, {{and the resulting}} increase in the Yak-38's overall performance and capability was exploited during the passage of Novorossiysk from Severomorsk to join the Pacific Fleet. A pair of armed Yak-38s operating from Minsk <b>intercepted</b> <b>aircraft</b> from the U.S. carrier Enterprise over the Arabian Sea on 16 December 1982. This event {{marked the first time}} Soviet VTOL <b>aircraft</b> <b>intercepted</b> American <b>aircraft</b> while armed with missiles.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the main site, a Ground Air Transmit Receive (GATR) site was located 3.5 {{miles north of the}} main site, at a heading of 335 degrees, in order to gain some distance from the high-powered RF energy from the search radar systems. The GATR sites were used to communicate audibly to <b>intercept</b> <b>aircraft</b> in order to vector them to airborne targets. AN/GRT-3 [...] systems were the transmitters used, along with AN/GRR-7 [...] receivers. Backup Transceivers, AN/GRC-27 [...] systems were used to cover frequencies that were lost due to outages of the main transmitters and receivers. In {{addition to}} these, an AN/GKA-5 Time-division Data-link (TDDL) system [...] was used to digitally provide the vectoring data to the F-106 Delta Dart <b>intercept</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|R
500|$|... "However in {{case the}} flight {{recorders}} shall become available to the western countries their data may be used for: Confirmation of no attempt by the <b>intercepting</b> <b>aircraft</b> to establish a radio contact with the intruder plane on 121.5MHz and no tracers warning shots in the last section of the flight" ...|$|R
50|$|The Swedish Saab 35 Draken was {{specifically}} designed for <b>intercepting</b> <b>aircraft</b> passing Swedish airspace at high altitudes {{in the event of}} a war between the Soviet Union and NATO. With the advent of low flying cruise-missiles and high-altitude AA-missiles the flight profile was changed, but regained the interceptor profile with the final version J 35J.|$|R
5000|$|During the 1950s, the MiG-15s of the USSR {{and their}} Warsaw Pact allies on many occasions, <b>intercepted</b> <b>aircraft</b> of the NATO air forces {{performing}} reconnaissance near or inside their territory; such incidents sometimes ended with aircraft of {{one side or}} the other being shot down. The known incidents where the MiG-15 was involved include: ...|$|R
50|$|Air defence ground {{units are}} those air defence {{organizations}} not equipped with aircraft. The majority {{are devoted to}} searching for, identifying, and keeping track of aircraft in the sky, and coordinating with fighters to <b>intercept</b> <b>aircraft</b> that either cannot be identified; are suspicious; require assistance; participating in criminal activity; intruding in sovereign airspace; or have been declared hostile.|$|R
50|$|And {{thus the}} concept of using the blip/scan to avoid detection. A high-speed, high-altitude {{aircraft}} might fly over early warning radars without being recognized. Moreover, even if an operator recognized the blip as an aircraft, {{the small number of}} returns and fast movement across the display would make it difficult or impossible to manually calculate a trajectory for relay to <b>intercepting</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On 23 December, {{aircraft}} {{from the}} American escort carrier [...] spotted a suspected runner {{and there were}} further reports of a flotilla of destroyers escorting another merchantman west from France. HMS Gambia, [...] Glasgow, and [...] formed a cordon to <b>intercept.</b> <b>Aircraft</b> attacked the flotilla, now escorting an incoming merchantman (SS Osorno), reporting a hit and a near-miss on Osorno.|$|R
5000|$|VF-142 {{became the}} first Atlantic Fleet F-14 {{squadron}} to intercept a Soviet Tu-95 [...] "Bear" [...] on 23 April 1976. One of the routine tasks U.S. Navy F-14s performed was <b>intercepting</b> <b>aircraft</b> that approached U.S. carrier groups too closely. Soviet strategic bombers and maritime reconnaissance aircraft regularly patrolled near U.S. carriers during the Cold War and were often escorted away by F-14s.|$|R
5000|$|Along {{with the}} Air Defense mission, {{the men and}} women of [...] "The Green Mountain Boys" [...] have also been tasked seven times to deploy to {{different}} locations in Central America to help patrol the skies and <b>intercept</b> <b>aircraft</b> suspected of illegally smuggling drugs. These missions were usually flown far offshore in the middle of the night and required a high degree of proficiency.|$|R
50|$|In 2006 and 2007 {{the unit}} {{returned}} to Afghanistan {{for two and}} three aircraft Aerospace Expeditionary Force rotations. On the home front, the end of 2007 found four <b>aircraft</b> <b>responding</b> to the great 2007 California wildfires.|$|R

50|$|In January 1950 the USAF asked Boeing and MARC to {{consider}} merging the GAPA and Wizard projects. Wizard's long-range radars and communications systems, {{combined with a}} greatly enlarged GAPA powered by ramjets, would offer a clear alternative to the 35 mile km ranged GAPA or Nike. By June the teams' design was for a Mach 3 winged missile to <b>intercept</b> <b>aircraft</b> at 80,000 ft up to 200 mi away, eventually emerging as the CIM-10 Bomarc. Wizard ABM efforts ended.|$|R
50|$|In {{military}} aviation, scrambling is {{the act of}} quickly getting {{military aircraft}} airborne to react to an immediate threat, usually to <b>intercept</b> hostile <b>aircraft.</b>|$|R
50|$|A bushfire at Katoomba and the Blue Mountains on 24 October {{caused some}} houses {{and a school}} to be evacuated, over 100 fire-fighters and three <b>aircraft</b> <b>responding</b> to contain the blaze. Some minor {{property}} damage occurred but no homes {{were lost in the}} blaze.|$|R
25|$|On April 5, 6 and 7 one Yugoslav Mig-29 was {{scrambled}} to <b>intercept</b> NATO <b>aircraft,</b> {{but each time}} Yugoslav pilots refused battle due to malfunctions.|$|R

2500|$|Though the 23lb {{projectiles}} have no explosives, their Mach 7 velocity {{gives them}} 32 megajoules of energy, but impact kinetic energy downrange will typically be 50 {{percent or less}} of the muzzle energy. [...] The Navy is looking into other uses for railguns, besides land bombardment, such as air defense; with the right targeting systems, projectiles could <b>intercept</b> <b>aircraft,</b> cruise missiles, and even ballistic missiles. The Navy is also developing directed energy weapons for air defense use, {{but it will be}} years before they will be effective.|$|R
5000|$|The third memo {{acknowledges}} that {{analysis of the}} recorder tapes showed no evidence of the Soviet interceptor attempting to contact KAL 007 via radio nor any indication that the KAL 007 had been given warning shots."However in case the flight recorders shall become available to the western countries their data may be used for: Confirmation of no attempt by the <b>intercepting</b> <b>aircraft</b> to establish a radio contact with the intruder plane on 121.5 MHz and no tracers warning shots in the last section of the flight" ...|$|R
50|$|In January 1982, the FAA {{unveiled}} the National Airspace System (NAS) Plan.The {{plan called for}} more advanced systems for Air Traffic Control, and improvements in ground-to-air surveillance and communication with new Doppler Radars and better transponders. Better computers and software were developed, air route traffic control centers were consolidated, {{and the number of}} flight service stations reduced. There is no overlap of responsibility between DoD and FAA within the NAS: this is why within FAA-controlled airspace the FAA is in charge of controlling and vectoring hijack <b>intercept</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|R
5000|$|First, {{atmospheric}} conditions, sunspots, the target's {{transmission schedule}} and antenna characteristics, {{and other factors}} create uncertainty that a given signal intercept sensor {{will be able to}} [...] "hear" [...] the signal of interest, even with a geographically fixed target and an opponent making no attempt to evade interception. Basic countermeasures against interception include frequent changing of radio frequency, polarization, and other transmission characteristics. An <b>intercept</b> <b>aircraft</b> could not get off the ground if it had to carry antennas and receivers for every possible frequency and signal type to deal with such countermeasures.|$|R
50|$|In late November 2014, the IDF {{revealed}} that the David's Sling system would soon be deployed in various areas around Israel for a trial period before becoming operational. Initial trials will focus {{on its ability to}} intercept short and medium-range rockets and missiles with a range of coverage three times greater than Iron Dome. After that, the system needs to undergo two further trials, testing its ability to <b>intercept</b> <b>aircraft</b> and longer-range missiles and then cruise missiles. David's Sling will be linked up to the Home Front Command's command and control systems, as well as also having its own independent interception management center.|$|R
50|$|Wimbledon {{had been}} the radar {{controller}} on duty at RAF Neatishead {{at the time of}} the sightings. While his account of events agreed with that of Perkins in some details, including the description of the aircraft being apparently chased by the object, he stated that it had in fact been his team who directed the two Venoms to the interception and that the U.S. personnel at Lakenheath would have been merely 'listening in'. Wimbledon disagreed with Klass' analysis, remembering the incident as involving a solid radar return tracked from three sets on the ground and one in the <b>intercepting</b> <b>aircraft.</b>|$|R
50|$|Military <b>aircraft</b> also <b>respond</b> on this {{frequency}} but use {{a different}} transmission protocol (see Step 3).|$|R
50|$|Borovykh flew {{during the}} Great Patriotic War fronts from December 1941. His {{operational}} range included Orel, Kursk, Gomel, Brest, Lviv, Warsaw, and Berlin. His missions involved <b>intercepting</b> enemy <b>aircraft,</b> providing cover for bombers, and aerial reconnaissance.|$|R
50|$|The {{squadron}} {{was first}} activated at Lajes Field in the Azores in November 1952 as the 57th Air Rescue Squadron in a reorganization of Air Rescue Service. The 7th Air Rescue Squadron at Wheelus Field, Libya was expanded {{into a group}} and each of its remotely stationed lettered flights {{was replaced by a}} new squadron. The 57th replaced Flight B of the 7th Squadron and assumed its personnel and equipment. The squadron mission was to <b>intercept</b> <b>aircraft</b> in distress while crossing the Atlantic and to escort them back to Lajes Field. The 57th also provided search and rescue for both downed aircraft and for ships.|$|R
