5|$|As {{genres of}} popular literature, science <b>fiction</b> <b>and</b> fantasy often seem more {{constrained}} than non-genre literature by their conventions of characterisation {{and the effects}} that these conventions have on depictions of sexuality and gender. Science fiction in particular has traditionally been a puritanical genre oriented toward a male readership. Sex is often linked to disgust in SF and horror, and plots based on sexual relationships have mainly been avoided in genre fantasy narratives. On the other hand, science <b>fiction</b> <b>and</b> fantasy can also provide more freedom than realistic literature to imagine alternatives to the default assumptions of heterosexuality and masculinity that permeate many cultures. Homosexuality is now an accepted and common feature of science <b>fiction</b> <b>and</b> fantasy literature, its prevalence due {{to the influence of}} lesbian-feminist and gay liberation movements.|$|E

The first issue was dated September/October 1939; the magazine was immediately successful, and {{less than a year later}} a companion magazine, Fantastic Novels, was launched.|$|E

In particular, the book contributes to prescient discussions around decolonization, post-capitalism and new kinds of social movements – exploring the intersections of these with contemporary art practice and visual culture. Contributions range from work on science, sonic <b>and</b> financial <b>fictions</b> <b>and</b> alternative space-time plots to myths and images generated by marginalized and ‘minor’ communities, queer-feminist strategies of <b>fictioning,</b> <b>and</b> the production of new Afro- and other futurisms...|$|R
