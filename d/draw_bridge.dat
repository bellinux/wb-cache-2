25|$|Market Street Bridge – Officially {{called the}} John Ross Bridge, this bridge is a bascule bridge, {{which is a}} type of <b>draw</b> <b>bridge.</b> The bridge was {{completed}} in 1917 for the large sum of $1,000,000 for the time. Having stood for decades since its last major overhaul, the Tennessee Department of Transportation declared it unsafe in late 2004. The bridge was closed in 2005 for a long-overdue renovation and was reopened on August 4, 2007.|$|E
25|$|The Forge is {{believed}} to have been purpose-built as a blacksmith's forge in the first half of the 19th century, when it was owned and run by Francis South. The Forge derives its name from the foot-bridge which crosses the River Welland next to the building, and which was originally made of chains. Watercolours by Hilkiah Burgess in the Spalding Gentlemen's Society collection indicate that it was a <b>draw</b> <b>bridge,</b> designed to enable boats and barges to navigate up river from the Wash. At this time there was a working port at Spalding, and the accounts for the period 1850-1860 show that the blacksmith of Chain Bridge Forge was servicing the boats here.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{existing}} narrow gauge between Stirling North and Port Augusta {{had been removed}} many years earlier, {{the challenge for the}} PRRPS was to develop an effective means of reinstating the narrow gauge in to Port Augusta. The greatest aspect to this challenge was how to cross over what remains of the standard gauge line to Marree, which has since been truncated at Leigh Creek {{with the opening of the}} newer standard gauge line from Tarcoola to Alice Springs in 1980. This line to Leigh Creek is exclusively used for transporting coal from Leigh Creek to Northern Power Station, and branches off the main standard gauge network at Stirling North. Many options for crossing this line were investigated, including a <b>draw</b> <b>bridge</b> arrangement, diamond crossovers and an underpass. The final decision was an underpass, passing below the Leigh Creek coal train line, which greatly reduced the amount of safe working interfacing with the standard gauge line. Diagram.|$|E

500|$|The Floating Harbour was {{constructed}} in 1809, isolating the Avon and Frome from tides between Cumberland Basin and Totterdown Lock. [...] The increasing use of the Frome as an open sewer combined {{with the loss of}} the scouring action of the tides meant that it was now becoming a health hazard and in 1825 it was again diverted, with locks at Stone House, channelling the main flow through Mylne's Culvert to the tidal Avon at New Cut, to the east of what is now Gaol Ferry Bridge. [...] Up to 1858 the Frome was open along its whole length, and crossed by some 13 bridges. [...] During {{the latter half of the}} nineteenth century, a culvert was built from Wade Street in St Judes to Stone Bridge, covering this stretch completely: Rupert Street, Fairfax Street and Broad Weir run over this culverted section. [...] St Augustine's Trench from Stone Bridge to <b>Draw</b> <b>Bridge</b> (near the northern end of Baldwin Street) was covered over in 1893 and the section between that point and the bottom of Park Street was covered over in 1938.|$|E

6000|$|Speaking of the {{execution}} of these two martyrs to the bee in their bonnets, John Davenport gives us a capital example {{of the way in}} which Divine [...] "judgments" [...] may be made to work both ways at the pleasure of the interpreter. As the crowd was going home from the hanging, a drawbridge gave way, and some lives were lost. The Quakers, of course, made the most of this lesson to the pontifices in the bearing power of timber, claiming it as a proof of God's wrath against the persecutors. This was rather hard, since none of the magistrates perished, and the popular feeling was strongly in favor of the victims of their severity. But Davenport gallantly captures these Quaker guns, and turns them against the enemy himself. [...] "Sir, the hurt that befell so many, by their own rashness, at the <b>Draw</b> <b>Bridge</b> in Boston, being on the day that the Quakers were executed, was not without God's special providence in judgment & wrath, I fear, against the Quakers & their abettors, who will be much hardened thereby." [...] This is admirable, especially as his parenthesis about [...] "their own rashness" [...] assumes that the whole thing was owing to natural causes. The pity for the Quakers, too, implied in the [...] "I fear," [...] is a nice touch. It is always noticeable how much more liberal those who deal in God's command without his power are of his wrath than of his mercy. But we should never understand the Puritans if we did not bear in mind that they were still prisoners in that religion of Fear which casts out Love. The nearness of God was oftener a terror than a comfort to them. Yet perhaps in them was the last apparition of Faith as a wonder-worker in human affairs. Take away from them what you will, you cannot deny them that, and its constant presence made them great in a way and measure of which this generation, it is to be feared, can have but a very inadequate conception. If men now-a-days find their tone antipathetic, it would be modest at least to consider whether the fault be wholly theirs,--whether it was they who lacked, or we who have lost. Whether they were right or wrong in their dealing with the Quakers is not a question to be decided glibly after two centuries' struggle toward a conception of toleration very imperfect even yet, perhaps impossible to human nature. If they did not choose what seems to us the wisest way of keeping the Devil out of their household, they certainly had a very honest will to keep him out, which we might emulate with advantage. However it be in other cases, historic toleration must include intolerance among things to be tolerated.|$|E
