5|$|Roberts {{switched}} to Dunlop tires for the 1982 season, as Goodyear {{pulled out of}} motorcycle racing. New competition had arrived as Honda entered their new two-stroke NS500 ridden by defending champion Lucchinelli, former 350cc world champion, Takazumi Katayama and newcomer Freddie Spencer. Roberts won the season-opening round in Argentina on the old square-four Yamaha, but then {{switched to}} the new OW61 YZR500 V4 engined bike. He came in third at the Austrian Grand Prix then, sat out the French Grand Prix at Nogaro as {{he and the other}} top riders boycotted the race over unsafe track conditions. Roberts then won the Spanish Grand Prix at Jarama ahead of Sheene, and scored a second place behind Suzuki rider Franco Uncini in the Netherlands. In a portent of things to come, Roberts was leading the Belgian Grand Prix when his Dunlop tires lost their grip and he had to settle for fourth place as Spencer went on to win his first Grand Prix for Honda. Roberts then injured his knee and <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> British Grand Prix and had to miss the Swedish round, but by then the world championship had been claimed by Uncini with a total of five victories while Roberts fell to fourth place. By the end of the 1982 season, Roberts had won sixteen 500cc Grand Prix races, more than double that of any of his contemporaries.|$|E

25|$|A {{serious effort}} was made in 1668 to secure a scheme of comprehension, with William Bates, Richard Baxter and Thomas Manton for the dissenters meeting Wilkins and Hezekiah Burton. Wilkins felt the Presbyterians could be brought within the Church of England, while the Independent separatists were left outside. It fell through by late summer, with Manton blaming John Owen for {{independent}} scheming for general toleration with Buckingham, and Baxter pointing the <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> House of Lords.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} achieve this effect, a seam bowler usually {{delivers}} the ball with the seam held upright, with rotation about a horizontal axis. This keeps the seam aligned vertically as it travels towards the batsman, making it likely that the ball will bounce with the seam on the pitch. Of course, consistently hitting the seam is {{not as easy as}} it sounds. The seam has to be held upright between the index finger and the middle <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time of the delivery of the ball and, most importantly, the wrist has to be dead straight when the ball is delivered. The seam and wrist position of Australia's Glenn McGrath are arguably a perfect example.|$|E
25|$|Following the 2007–08 NBA season, the Lakers faced two key {{injuries}} in the offseason. Andrew Bynum, who missed {{the second half of}} the season and playoffs was rehabilitating and working on conditioning. Trevor Ariza, who also missed {{the second half of the}} season, but later returned in the playoffs also had to work back into shape. Both players played on opening day. During the 2007–08 season, Kobe Bryant suffered a tear in his right pinkie <b>finger.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> time, Bryant decided to forgo surgery and play out the rest of the season and participate in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. He eventually chose to not to have surgery and let the hand heal naturally.|$|E
25|$|Kargil War: R {{was heavily}} criticised in 1999, {{following}} the Pakistani incursions at Kargil. Critics accused R {{of failing to}} provide intelligence that could have prevented the ensuing ten-week conflict that brought India and Pakistan {{to the brink of}} a full-scale war. While the Army has been critical of the information they received R has pointed the <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> politicians, claiming they had provided all the necessary information. However, R was successful in intercepting a telephonic conversation between Pervez Musharraf, the then Pakistan Army Chief who was in Beijing and his chief of staff Lt. Gen. Mohammed Aziz in Islamabad. This tape was later published by India to prove Pakistani involvement in the Kargil incursion. In 2011, a think tank report stated that RAW had warned in its October 1998 assessment that Pakistan Army might launch a limited swift offensive with possible support of alliance partners, however the government ignored such reports.|$|E

[...] He went to Buenos Aires to confront Rosas, who sent him on another political mission. On his way back, Facundo {{was shot and killed}} at Barranca Yaco, Córdoba. According to Sarmiento, the murder was plotted by Rosas: [...] "An impartial history still awaits facts and revelations, in order to point its <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> instigator of the assassins".|$|E
500|$|Smith was {{credited}} with creating or popularizing the following basketball techniques: The [...] "tired signal," [...] in which a player would use a hand signal (originally a raised fist) to indicate {{that he needed to}} come out for a rest, huddling at the free throw line before a foul shot, encouraging players who scored a basket to point a <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> teammate who passed them the ball, in honor of the passer's selflessness, instituting a variety of defensive sets in one game, having the point guard call out the defense set for the team, and creating a number of defensive sets, including the point zone, the run-and-jump, and double-teaming the screen-and-roll.|$|E

500|$|From their {{advantageous}} height by Königgrätz, the Austrians frequently bombarded the Prussian army encamped below them. On {{the same}} day that Frederick's doctors bled him, an Austrian cannonade grew so strong that Frederick rode out to observe the damage. During the ride, his vein opened. A company medic bound his wound, an incident later depicted by the painter Bernhard Rode. In his admiring history of Frederick the Great, the English historian Thomas Carlyle (1795–1881) relayed the story of Frederick and a Croatian marksman. As Frederick was reconnoitering, Carlyle maintained, the King encountered the Croat taking aim at him. Reportedly, he wagged his <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> man, as if to say, [...] "Do not do that." [...] The Croat thought better of shooting the King, and disappeared into the woods; some reports maintain he actually knelt before the king and kissed his hand.|$|E
500|$|The role {{of extra}} 9413 was played by Jules Raucourt, {{credited}} {{in the film}} simply as [...] "Raucourt". Although Raucourt started {{his career as a}} leading man of silent action films, he ironically became a film extra himself after cinema transitioned into the sound era. Raucourt later wrote a novel using the title of the film. The role of Extra #13 was played by Adriane Marsh, herself a film extra, who never again obtained a named role in cinema. Extra #15, who then becomes a movie star, was portrayed by Voya George, a personal friend of Vorkapić, who went on to a career in European films. Robert Florey also himself appears in the film as a casting director, although only his disembodied mouth and hand are visible, shaking his <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> protagonist. Slavko Vorkapić also had a brief role in the film as the man constantly walking up the stairs toward the words [...] "SUCCESS".|$|E
500|$|In the {{original}} fairy tale, the princess actually sleeps for 100 {{years before she}} is finally awoken by the prince's kiss; this detail was adjusted for the film in favor of having Prince Phillip introduced much earlier, and thus Aurora is awoken much sooner. The writers also omitted darker elements featured in the earliest versions of [...] "Sleeping Beauty", such as the princess being raped and impregnated with twins by the prince while she is asleep. In the Brothers Grimm's version, the princess is destined to prick her <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> age of 15, while Disney {{decided to make the}} character one year older. Aurora's names are borrowed from both Tchaikovsky's ballet and the Brothers Grimm's version of the fairy tale. While Tchaikovsky referred to his princess as [...] "Aurora", the Brothers Grimm named her [...] "Little Briar Rose". This ultimately inspired Disney to use both, the latter of which serves as the character's alias while she is hiding from Maleficent. Aurora was the last princess in whose conception Walt Disney himself was directly involved.|$|E

500|$|Levels were {{designed}} {{based on a}} Deluxe Paint interface, which allowed several of the members to design levels, resulting in [...] "hundreds of levels". There were several internal iterations of the levels, each designer challenging the others. Dailly pointed out that David Jones [...] "used to try and beat us, and after proudly stabbing a <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> screen and saying 'There! Beat that!', we'd calmly point out a totally new way of getting around all his traps, and {{doing it in a}} much simpler method. 'Oh...', he'd mutter, and scramble off to try and fix it." [...] They also sent internally tested levels to Psygnosis, getting back the results of their testing via fax. While most were solved quickly, Dailly commented that [...] "Every now and again though, the fax would be covered in scribbles with the time and comments crossed out again and again; this is what we were striving for while we were designing the levels, and it gave us all a warm fuzzy feeling inside." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{their time}} in Jacksonville, the McCains' {{marriage}} began to falter. [...] McCain had extramarital affairs; he was seen with other women in social settings and developed a reputation among his colleagues for womanizing. [...] Some of McCain's activity with other women occurred when he was off-duty after routine flights to Marine Corps Air Station Yuma and Naval Air Facility El Centro. [...] McCain later said, [...] "My marriage's collapse was attributable to my own selfishness and immaturity more {{than it was to}} Vietnam, and I cannot escape blame by pointing a <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> war. The blame was entirely mine." [...] His wife Carol later stated that the failure was not due to her accident or Vietnam and that [...] "I attribute [...] more to John turning 40 and wanting to be 25 again than I do to anything else." [...] John McCain's biographer, Robert Timberg, believes that [...] "Vietnam did play a part, perhaps not the major part, but more than a walk-on." [...] According to John McCain, [...] "I had changed, she had changed. People who have been apart that much change." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mutombo also {{achieved}} {{a certain level}} of on-court notoriety. After a successful block, he was known for taunting his opponents by waving his index finger, like a parent reproaching a disobedient child. Later in his career NBA officials would respond to the gesture with a technical foul for unsportsmanlike conduct. To avoid the technical foul, Mutombo took to waving his <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> crowd after a block, which is not considered taunting by rules. In addition, his flailing elbows were known for injuring several NBA players, including Michael Jordan, Dennis Rodman, Charles Oakley, Patrick Ewing, Chauncey Billups, Ray Allen, Yao Ming, LeBron James and Tracy McGrady. His former teammate Yao Ming made a joke about it: [...] "I need to talk to Coach to have Dikembe held out of practice, because if he hits somebody in practice, it's our teammate. At least in the games, it's 50/50." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Lee Kuan Yew, {{there were}} irreconciliable {{differences}} between the two from the outset, due to the UMNO's communal politics. [...] The racial riots in July 1964, triggered and intensified the political rift between PAP and UMNO. Communal politics was often the central theme of Malaysian Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman’s speeches and he often pointed the <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> PAP leaders and Lee Kuan Yew for interfering in his political party’s decisions and for contesting in Malaya’s federal elections advocating for a non-communal politics. Furthermore, Tunku Abdul Rahman’s encouragement of racial tension and anti-PAP sentiments among Singaporean Malays made it difficult for the PAP to work with UMNO to forge good relations. Thus, these ideological differences on party politics and the outbreaks of the racial riots in 1964 were some of the important contributing factors which led to the eventual separation of Singapore from the Malayan, paving the way for Singapore’s independence in June 1965. Singapore was finally declared an independent and sovereign state on August 9, 1965.|$|E
2500|$|After Burroughs {{graduated}} from Harvard, his formal education ended, except for brief flirtations with graduate study {{of anthropology at}} Columbia and medicine in Vienna, Austria. He traveled to Europe and became involved in Austrian and Hungarian Weimar-era LGBT culture; he picked up young men in steam baths in Vienna and moved in a circle of exiles, homosexuals, and runaways. There, he met Ilse Klapper, a Jewish woman fleeing the country's Nazi government. The two were never romantically involved, but Burroughs married her, in Croatia, against the wishes of his parents, {{to allow her to}} gain a visa to the United States. She made her way to New York City, and eventually divorced Burroughs, although they remained friends for many years. After returning to the United States, he held a string of uninteresting jobs. In 1939, his mental health became a concern for his parents, especially after he deliberately severed the last joint of his left little <b>finger</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> knuckle to impress a man with whom he was infatuated. This event made its way into his early fiction as the short story [...] "The Finger." ...|$|E
