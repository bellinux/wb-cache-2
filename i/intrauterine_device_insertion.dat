They also comment on its analgesic properties for cervical and uterine instrumentation. Methods The authors reviewed 275 referrals seen over a 6 -month period in consultant-delivered clinics provided by a contraception service that serves a single county (population 500 000). They describe the simple technique they use for hysterosonography with Instillagel. Results The authors found Instillagel useful as a contrast medium for sonographic assessment of the endometrial cavity. Additionally, presence of gel in the endometrial cavity, with a time interval between insertion of gel and uterine instrumentation, appears to result in analgesia and relaxation of the uterus. There was a very low incidence of diffi culties in a group of patients who had previously experienced signifi cant problems with uterine instrumentation. Conclusions Hysterosonography is an effi cacious, simple and inexpensive technique for assessment of the endometrial cavity. It has many potential applications in contraceptive care.

WHO headquarters sent questionnaires to country-level focal points to complete with their Ministry of Health counterparts. Between February and May 2016, 23 of 32 (72 %) surveys were completed. All respondents reported that their countries had used the MEC document in the past, with most reporting that they had used the guidance as a reference (n = 20, 87 %), for training purposes (n = 19, 83 %), to change clinical practices (n = 17, 74 %), and to develop national policies (n = 16, 70 %). While many respondents (16, 70 %) indicated their countries already include immediate postpartum <b>intrauterine</b> <b>device</b> <b>insertion</b> among breastfeeding women in their family planning policies, few reported currently allowing use of progestogen-only pills (n = 8, 35 %) or implants (n = 8, 35 %) during the immediate postpartum period (i. e., less than 48 hours after delivery) for breastfeeding women. A higher percentage of respondents indicated their countries allowed breastfeeding women the option of progestogen-only pills (n = 16, 70 %) and implants (n = 13, 57 %) between 48 hours and 6 weeks postpartum.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} whether a department policy changing the scheduling of the postpartum visit from 6 weeks to 2 - 3 weeks after delivery {{is associated with}} higher long-acting reversible contraception initiation at the postpartum visit. We conducted a quasiexperimental before-after study to evaluate long-acting reversible contraception initiation, specifically an intrauterine device or contraceptive implant, at the postpartum visit between women scheduled for follow-up at 6 weeks (before policy change) and 2 - 3 weeks after delivery (after policy change). Secondary outcomes included postpartum visit completion, overall contraception initiation at the postpartum visit, overall contraceptive use at 6 months after delivery, and repeat pregnancies by 6 months postpartum. We obtained delivery and postpartum information using the electronic medical record and contacted participants 3 and 6 months after delivery to assess contraception use and repeat pregnancies. We enrolled 586 participants between December 2014 and November 2015, of whom 512 women (256 in each cohort) continued to meet eligibility criteria after delivery. Long-acting reversible contraception initiation rates at the postpartum visit were lower in the 2 - to 3 -week (16. 5 %, 95 % CI 12. 2 - 21. 8) compared with the 6 -week group (31. 1 %, 95 % CI 25. 2 - 37. 7, P<. 01), primarily {{as a result of}} patient and health care provider preferences for delaying <b>intrauterine</b> <b>device</b> <b>insertion</b> to a later visit. More women completed a scheduled 2 - to 3 -week postpartum visit (90. 2 %, 95 % CI 86. 0 - 93. 3) compared with a 6 -week visit (81. 6 %, 95 % CI 76. 4 - 85. 9, P<. 01).

To verify if ultrasound is an adequatemethod to follow-up postplacental IUD insertions. To assess if theimmediate insertion of postplacental IUD leads to an increasedrisk of uterine infections and perforations, or greater likelihood ofpregnancy during the observation period. Methods: A group of 50 patients who had an <b>intrauterine</b> <b>device</b> introduced within tenminutes after delivery of the placenta were studied. Twenty-fivewomen had vaginal delivery and 25 had cesarean sections. Theintrauterine device used in this study was the Multiload CU 375,standard model, manufactured by Organon Ltd., in Ireland. Theintrauterine device was inserted in those who had vaginal deliveryeither manually and under anesthesia, or with an inserter, whichdid not require anesthesia. In patients who had cesarean sections,the insertion was manual. Clinical and ultrasound follow up wasperformed four times: 48 hours postpartum, and at 6, 12 and 24 weeks. The distance {{from the top of the}} <b>intrauterine</b> <b>device</b> to theuterine fundus was measured by ultrasound. Results: This studyshowed a significant difference in postplacental intrauterinedevices inserted after vaginal deliveries and cesarean sections. The expulsion/removal rate was 32 % among the subjects who hadan <b>intrauterine</b> <b>device</b> inserted after vaginal delivery.

40|$|Abstract Introduction <b>Intrauterine</b> {{contraceptive}} <b>devices</b> may {{at times}} perforate and migrate to adjacent organs. Such uterine perforation usually passes unnoticed with development of potentially serious complications. Case presentation A 25 -year-old woman of North Indian origin presented with an acute tender lump {{in the right}} iliac fossa. The lump was initially thought to be an appendicular lump and treated conservatively. Resolution of the lump was incomplete. On exploratory laparotomy, a hard suspicious mass {{was found in the}} anterior abdominal wall of the right iliac fossa. Wide excision and bisection of the mass revealed a copper-T embedded inside. Examination of the uterus did not show any evidence of perforation. The next day, the patient gave a history of past copper-T <b>Intrauterine</b> contraceptive <b>device</b> <b>insertion.</b> Conclusions Copper-T insertion is one of the simplest contraceptive methods but its neglect with inadequate follow-up may lead to uterine perforation and extra-uterine migration. Regular self-examination for the "threads" supplemented with abdominal X-ray and/or ultrasound in the follow-up may detect copper-T migration early. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of <b>intrauterine</b> contraceptive <b>device</b> migration to the anterior abdominal wall of the right iliac fossa. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Incomplete uterine {{perforation}} after <b>intrauterine</b> <b>device</b> (IUD) <b>insertion</b> has occasionally been observed. We {{report on}} three patients who underwent flexible hysteroscopy for localization and retrieval of these intramural devices. Case Reports: Three Taiwanese women presented with lower abdominal pain, discomfort during defecation and frequent urination. All used a Nova-T IUD for contraception. Sonography suggested dislocation of the IUD or perforation, and pelvic examination revealed missing strings. All the women underwent flexible hysteroscopy to localize and retrieve the devices. The hysteroscopic examination indicated partial perforation or embedding {{of the device}} into the cervical or uterine wall. Retrieval was smoothly performed without cervical dilatation or anesthesia in all three women. All devices were directly retrieved using the grasping forceps of the flexible hysterofibroscope. The subsequent courses were smooth and uneventful. Conclusion: Flexible hysteroscopy is a simple and useful tool for diagnosis and retrieval of intramural IUDs.

40|$|Background: Use {{of modern}} {{contraceptive}} methods {{has been shown}} to reduce unwanted pregnancy, high parity and maternal mortality. <b>Intrauterine</b> contraceptive <b>devices</b> which are among the safest and most effective reversible contraceptives available, are particularly suitable for women in developing countries as they are affordable, convenient to use, do not require re-supply visits and are very cost-effective. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the socio-demographic characteristics of <b>intrauterine</b> contraceptive <b>device</b> acceptors, the pattern of insertions and complications at the University of Uyo Teaching hospital, Uyo. Method: The record cards of all clients who had <b>intrauterine</b> contraceptive <b>device</b> inserted at the family planning clinic over a six-year period were reviewed. Results: During the study period, there were 852 new contraceptive acceptors out of which 39. 7 &#x 0025; accepted the <b>intrauterine</b> contraceptive <b>device.</b> The modal age group of the clients was 25 - 29 years (32. 5 &#x 0025;). Acceptance of <b>intrauterine</b> contraceptive <b>device</b> was most common among multiparous clients (65. 1 &#x 0025;). Majority of the acceptors were married (90. 0 &#x 0025;), Christians (98. 8 &#x 0025;) and 72. 8 &#x 0025; had at least secondary school education. Clinic personnel (65. 7 &#x 0025;) and friends/relatives (21. 3 &#x 0025;) were the most common sources of information on contraception. Most (93. 5 &#x 0025;) of the clients had their <b>intrauterine</b> contraceptive <b>devices</b> inserted within 7 days of menstruation.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe {{objective}} was to describe the endometrial milieu of stable transplant patients and healthy women before and after levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) insertion. Study designWomen between 18 and 45 years of age desiring LNG-IUS insertion were enrolled with a 2 : 1 ratio of healthy to stable solid organ transplant patients. The first visit entailed a blood draw, uterine lavage and endometrial biopsy followed by LNG-IUS insertion. Follow-up visit involved a repeat serum draw, uterine lavage and endometrial biopsy. Cytokine levels were measured in the uterine lavage and serum by quantifying inflammatory biomarkers. Immunohistochemistry staining {{was performed on the}} endometrial tissue to measure macrophage levels. Statistical analysis included a nonparametric analysis that compared medians of the marker levels before and after <b>intrauterine</b> <b>device</b> (IUD) <b>insertion</b> within the group and between the two groups. ResultsSixteen participants completed the study: 5 solid organ transplant patients and 11 healthy patients. For the serum, there were no marked changes in the cytokines or soluble receptor levels in either group after IUD insertion. However, in the uterine lavage, there was an increase in cytokine levels post-IUD insertion for both healthy and transplant women. For the endometrial tissue, there was evidence of macrophage activity in both groups after <b>device</b> <b>insertion.</b> ConclusionsThis pilot study investigated the uterine environment of the transplant patient population. Findings have pointed to the strong local inflammatory response following LNG-IUS insertion for the transplant recipients. In addition, these preliminary findings will help power a larger study that can investigate the safety and effectiveness of the IUD in this patient population. ImplicationsFindings from this pilot study suggest that the IUD is inducing a local inflammatory reaction in the uterus of the transplant patient as in the healthy control. A larger study can build on these preliminary results to pursue the efficacy and safety of IUD use among solid organ transplant patients...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: A {{substantial}} {{proportion of}} women who undergo an abortion continue afterwards without switching to more effective contraceptive use. Many subsequently have repeat unintended pregnancies. This study, therefore, aimed to identify and describe health professionalg experiences of providing contraceptive counselling to women seeking an abortion. Methods: We interviewed 21 health professionals (HPs), involved in contraceptive counselling of women seeking abortion at three differently sized hospitals in Sweden. The interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim and analysed using conventional qualitative content analysis. Results: Three clusters were identified: Complex counselling, Elements of counselling and Finding a method. HPs often experienced consultations including contraceptive counselling {{at the time of}} an abortion as complex, covering both pregnancy termination and contraceptive counselling. Women with vulnerabilities placed even greater demands on the HPs providing counselling. The HPs varied in their approaches when providing contraceptive counselling but also in their knowledge about certain contraception methods. HPs described challenges in finding out if women had found an effective method and in the practicalities of arranging <b>intrauterine</b> <b>device</b> (IUD) <b>insertion</b> post-abortion, when a woman asked for this method. Conclusions: HPs found it challenging to provide contraceptive counselling at the time of an abortion and to arrange access to IUDs post-abortion.

40|$|Objectives. Little {{is known}} about the utility of simulation-based {{training}} in office gynaecology. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the self-reported effectiveness and acceptability of the PelvicSim™ (VirtaMed), a high-fidelity mobile simulator, to train clinicians in <b>intrauterine</b> <b>device</b> (IUD) <b>insertion.</b> Methods. Clinicians at ambulatory healthcare centres participated in a PelvicSim IUD training programme and completed a self-administered survey. The survey assessed prior experience with IUD insertion, pre- and post-training competency and comfort and opinions regarding the acceptability of the PelvicSim. Results. The 237 participants were primarily female (97. 5 %) nurse practitioners (71. 3 %). Most had experience inserting the levonorgestrel LNG 20 IUD and the copper T 380 A device, but only 4. 1 % had ever inserted the LNG 14 IUD. For all three devices, participants felt more competent following training, with the most striking change reported for insertion of the LNG 14 IUD. The majority of participants reported increased comfort with uterine sounding (57. 7 %), IUD insertion on a live patient (69. 8 %), and minimizing patient pain (72. 8 %) following training. Of the respondents, 89. 6 % reported the PelvicSim IUD insertion activities as “valuable” or “very valuable. ” All participants would recommend the PelvicSim for IUD training, and nearly all (97. 2 %) reported that the PelvicSim was a better method to teach IUD insertion than the simple plastic models supplied by IUD manufacturers. Conclusions. These findings support the use of the PelvicSim for IUD training, though whether it is superior to traditional methods and improves patient outcomes requires evaluation...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The {{current study}} aims {{to compare the}} {{efficacy}} and safety of 200 mcg versus 400 mcg vaginal misoprostol administered 3 h prior to <b>intrauterine</b> <b>device</b> (IUD) <b>insertion</b> in parous women. Study design: A randomized double-blind controlled trial. Setting: Women’s Health Hospital, Assiut, Egypt. Materials and methods: Two-hundred twelve women were randomized into two groups; group I received 2 misoprostol 400 mcg tablets and group II received one misoprostol 200 mcg and one placebo tablet vaginally three hours before a copper IUD insertion. The primary outcome was the rate of successful IUD insertion in both groups. The secondary outcomes include the rate of adverse effects. Results: There was no statistical difference between both groups as regard successful IUD insertion (p =  0. 17). Additionally, the satisfaction score reported by the women was not statistically different (p =  0. 11). Failure of IUD insertion was present in three cases in the misoprostol 400 mcg group versus four cases in the misoprostol 200 mcg group (p =  0. 45). Both groups were similar regarding the duration of insertion (p =  0. 85). Abdominal cramping and shivering were the main side effects in both groups, however the rate of their occurrence was significantly higher in the misoprostol 400 mcg group than the other group (30. 2 % versus 10. 4 % and 7. 5 % versus 1. 9 %, respectively; p =  0. 0001). Conclusion: Vaginal misoprostol 200 mcg prior to IUD insertion appears {{to be similar to}} 400 mcg as regard the success of IUD insertion and procedure duration with significantly lower side effects...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the combination of levonorgestrel-releasing <b>intrauterine</b> <b>device</b> (LNG-IUD) <b>insertion</b> and palliative radiotherapy (RT) as a potential approach for treating frail, elderly endometrial cancer (EC) patients considered unfit for curative oncological treatments. The inclusion criteria were an age of ≥ 65 years, pathological confirmation of a uterine neoplasm, a Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) value of ≥ 4 {{and the presence of}} vaginal bleeding. Patients underwent intrauterine insertion of an LNG-IUD, and thereafter, received a total dose of 30 Gy at 3 Gy per fraction, over 10 days. The clinical target volume (CTV) was defined as the uterus and disease-involved tissues in the pelvis plus a 1 -cm margin. The planning target volume was obtained by adding a 1 -cm isotropic margin to the CTV. A total of 9 patients with EC (median age, 85 years; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≥ 2, ≥ 88. 8 %; obesity, 55. 5 %; median CCI, 5) received an LNG-IUD plus RT. An early complete resolution of bleeding was documented in 8 patients (88. 8 %), while the remaining patient experienced a marked improvement. The median duration of bleeding control was 18 months, while the 2 -year actuarial rate of bleeding-free survival was 53. 3 % (median follow-up time, 20 months; range, 9 - 60 months). No LNG-IUD- or severe RT-related complications were documented. Overall, a high rate of bleeding remission, durable bleeding-free survival in face of the easy intrauterine insertion of an LNG-IUD and a negligible toxicity profile of the complete treatment were documented in this study, indicating a requirement for further investigation in a larger series...|$|R

40|$|Background. Uterine {{perforation}} and transvesical {{migration of}} an <b>intrauterine</b> <b>device</b> are rare complications. Case. A 28 -year-old {{woman who had}} an <b>intrauterine</b> <b>device</b> was admitted to our outpatient clinic with complaints of amenorrhea lasting 5 weeks and pelvic pain lasting a year. Transvaginal ultrasonography revealed embedding of the <b>intrauterine</b> <b>device</b> in the bladder. The misplaced device was removed by laparotomy. Conclusion. The followup of <b>intrauterine</b> <b>device</b> localization with transvaginal ultrasonography is essential for early detection of possible serious complications...|$|R
40|$|Background: Pelvic {{inflammatory}} {{disease is a}} community-acquired infection accounting for approximately 1. 2 million hospital visits and $ 1. 88 billion in cost annually in the United States. Few interventions are available {{for the prevention of}} pelvic {{inflammatory disease}}. <b>Intrauterine</b> <b>devices</b> are a well established method of contraception, in addition, levonorgestrel-releasing <b>intrauterine</b> <b>devices</b> may provide a protective advantage against pelvic inflammatory disease. This review aims to evaluate the available evidence to determine if levonorgestrel <b>intrauterine</b> <b>devices,</b> in addition to contraception, provide a protective benefit against pelvic inflammatory disease when compared to other <b>intrauterine</b> <b>devices.</b> Method: An extensive literature search was performed using the databases MEDLINE, Web of Science, and CINAHL. Duplicate results and non-English articles were excluded. Articles meeting inclusion criteria were analyzed using the GRADE system. Results: The literature search identified three articles that met inclusion criteria. All studies were randomized comparison trials involving a levonorgestrel <b>intrauterine</b> <b>device</b> compared to one or more forms of copper <b>intrauterine</b> <b>device.</b> Studies showed conflicting evidence supporting the benefit of levonorgestrel <b>intrauterine</b> <b>devices</b> for the prevention of pelvic inflammatory disease. All studies were of very low quality. Conclusion: Limited very low quality evidence is available to support the potential benefit of levonorgestrel <b>intrauterine</b> <b>devices</b> for the prevention of pelvic inflammatory disease. Research results are conflicting and there is a small amount of very low quality evidence to support this theory. Based on the current research levonorgestrel <b>intrauterine</b> <b>devices</b> for the prevention of pelvic inflammatory disease are not recommended. Further well designed prognostic studies are needed to determine the protective potential of levonorgestrel <b>intrauterine</b> <b>devices...</b>|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the study}} was to provide an {{overview}} to infectious and reactive cytological effects of <b>intrauterine</b> <b>devices,</b> which are one of the most widely used methods of contraception, with the results we obtained in the Mardin region. Material and Method: We evaluated together the pap smears of the 300 <b>intrauterine</b> <b>device</b> (+) and 300 <b>intrauterine</b> <b>device</b> (-) patients sent to the pathology department in the period of 2010 - 2011. Genital infection rates and frequency of reactive-dysplastic cellular changes were statistically compared between the groups together with the literature data. Results: In the <b>intrauterine</b> <b>device</b> (+) group, 2 (+) and more severe inflammation was observed in 66. 3 % of cases. Bacterial vaginosis (26 %), candida (12 %) and trichomonas vaginalis (8 %) were recorded as the most common infectious agents, followed by actinomyces (4 %). Between the groups of <b>intrauterine</b> <b>device</b> (+) and (-), no significant difference was observed in terms of the incidence of squamous cell abnormalities, except ASC-US (p= 0. 02). In the <b>intrauterine</b> <b>device</b> (+) group, the presence of atypical glandular cells and reactive findings was significantly higher than the control group. After the removal of the <b>intrauterine</b> <b>device,</b> 61 cases that had control smears showed regression, with a rate of % 75. 4 (n= 46). Conclusion: The local irritative and inflammatory effect of <b>intrauterine</b> <b>devices</b> basically causes reactive and regenerative changes mostly in glandular cells. <b>Intrauterine</b> <b>devices</b> disrupt the genital flora and significantly increase the frequency of genital infection by creating a foreign body reaction...|$|R
