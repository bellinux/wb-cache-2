Genetic engineering is a big chance and hope for the humanity, nevertheless it brings also many serious menaces. It is essential first of all to obse regulations of the “Convention on protection of human rights and on dignity o f a human bemg as against applications of biology and medical sciences (May 1997) as well as to observe the Additional Protocol on ’’The Ban on coning of a human being" which was adopted <b>in</b> <b>Pans</b> <b>on</b> January, 1988...|$|R
50|$|The {{industrial}} production of bread became notable during these years. At {{the beginning of}} the 20th century it is estimated that only about 8% of Canadian wives bought bread commercially. However, the {{industrial production}} of bread grew impressively and by the 1960s, 95% of homemakers purchased bread commercially. One bakery of note, The Canada Bread Company Limited, was founded in 1911 {{as the result of the}} amalgamation of five smaller companies. Industrial bakeries such as this were characterized by the use of large machines for the mixing of dough, which was placed <b>in</b> <b>pans</b> <b>on</b> slow moving conveyor belts that transported them through giant ovens, where they were baked. Large automated packaging machines wrapped the finished loaves at great speed. Improvements in transportation and packaging technology throughout the decades allowed a shrinking number of bakeries to serve every larger markets. In 1939 there were about 3200 commercial bakeries across the country but by 1973 the figure stood at 1700, while in 1981 there were 1400.|$|R

50|$|Another {{variant of}} a Great Depression-era shotgun slug design is the wax slug.

Once the shell cooled, the birdshot was now held in a mass by the cooled paraffin, and formed a slug. No roll or fold crimp was required to hold the wax slug in the hull. These were often used to poach deer during the Depression.|$|R

5000|$|... 1950 the Swiss Roger Perrinjaquet invents an appliance, {{which is}} {{patended}} on the 6th March 1950 under the section handheld appliances. His wish {{was to work}} with this appliance directly <b>in</b> <b>pans</b> <b>on</b> the stove. Bamix, {{the name of this}} handheld blender is composed of the words battre and mixer (beat and mix). Without having investors, Perrinjaquet sold the patents to ESGE Ltd, which was producing initially bicycle racks, electrical kitchen knives, watches and small electrical motors. At the end of the Fifties, the company launched the fabrication of the first handheld blenders in serie. At the beginning of the Sixties, several production sites were opened, especially the current head office of the company in Mettlen, in the canton Thurgau. During this period, the daily production amounts to 250 blenders, today it is a number of 2000 blenders. The company is selling nowadays its products worldwide in over 25 countries. 1964 the company was sold to the group General Electrics. The Americans tried to increase the falling sales figures through the reduction of the production sites.The Belgian Walter Bodart purchased the company back in 1971. ESGE Ltd. in Mettlen will be the only site for Bamix. The philosophy of Walter Bodart is simple: Quality for quantity, concentration on one single product and an administrative organisation as small as possible.1986 took place a management by out to the sirs Gunsch, Rüttiman and Stahl. 2002 the group is sold to the Sirs Jud and Eigenmann. Erich Eigenmann serves as CEO of ESGE Ltd. since 1 October 2002. Since its inventation, Bamix has changed rarely during the last decennium.|$|R

40|$|With {{varying the}} {{molecular}} weight, copolymer chemical structure and concentration, the probe diffusion behavior of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) in N, N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc) solutions of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) was studied by dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique. In {{combination with the}} systematic viscosity property investigation for PAN/DMAc system, the probe diffusion results provided insight to understand the interactions between PAN and SWCNTs. It was found that, due to depletion interaction, the SWCNT diffusion positively deviates from the Stokes&# 8211;Einstein (SE) relation <b>in</b> <b>PAN</b> homopolymer solutions. However, <b>in</b> <b>PAN</b> copolymer solution, the SWCNT diffusion mostly obeys the SE relation, which was speculated {{as a result of}} hydrogen-bonding formation between the carboxylic acid functional groups <b>in</b> <b>PAN</b> copolymers and <b>on</b> purified SWCNTs. Moreover, due to the unique features of SWCNT probes &# 8211; very long, extremely rigid, and adjustable bundle diameter, the SWCNT probe diffusion unambiguously revealed the topological constraints of polymer network responsible for the retardation of thin rod diffusion. Quantitative analysis indicated that the correlation length rather than the “tube” diameter of polymer liquid is the critical length scale to dictate the diffusion retardation of SWCNTs in polymer solutions. close 3...|$|R
