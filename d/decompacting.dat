40|$|A {{short term}} field {{mesocosm}} experiment {{was performed in}} semi-deciduous forest areas of Ivory Coast {{to assess the impact}} of a <b>decompacting</b> (Hyperiodrilus africanus, Eudrilidae) and two compacting (Millsonia omodeoi and Dichogaster terraenigrae, Acanthodrilidae) earthworm species on soil properties. These species have been selected for their predominance in the region and their contrasting impact on soil structure. The experimental design consisted of a treatment without worms (control), and treatments with one, two or three species of earthworms. Both compacting and <b>decompacting</b> earthworms increased water infiltration rate in all treatments, with marked impact in H. africanus and M. omodeoi+D. terraenigrae treatments. Interactions between compacting and <b>decompacting</b> species resulted in more large aggregates in comparison to when the compacting species D. terraenigrae was alone. This may be accounted for by their compacting attribute as compacting earthworms are responsible for producing the highest number of large aggregates. The low values of mean weight diameter in treatments combining <b>decompacting</b> and compacting earthworms compared with compacting "M. omodeoi" one also confirmed the trend of decline in soil compaction in the presence of the <b>decompacting</b> species. These results showed positive impact of species richness on soil structure regulation, which is crucial in ecosystem productivity and support consequently the insurance hypothesis. In fact, this study showed that the preservation of earthworm species belonging to these two contrasting functional groups is essential for the maintenance of stable soil structure regulation in agro-tropical ecosystems [Current Zoology 58 (4) : 556 – 565, 2012]...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the role of}} intracellular Ca 2 + in compaction, the first morphogenetic event in embryogenesis, we analyzed preimplantation mouse embryos under several <b>decompacting</b> conditions, including depletion of extracellular Ca 2 +, blocking of Ca 2 + channels, and inhibition of microfilaments, calmodulin, and intracellular Ca 2 + release. Those treatments induced decompaction of mouse morulae and simultaneously induced changes in cytosolic free Ca 2 + concentration and deregionalization of E-cadherin and fodrin. When morulae were allowed to recompact, the location of both proteins recovered. In contrast, actin did not change its cortical location with compaction nor with decompaction-recompaction. Calmodulin localized in areas opposite to cell–cell contacts in eight-cell stage embryos before and after compaction. Inhibition of calmodulin with trifluoperazine induced its delocalization while morulae decompacted. A nonspecific rise of intracellular free Ca 2 + provoked by ionomycin {{did not affect the}} compacted shape. Moreover, the same <b>decompacting</b> treatments when applied to uncompacted embryos did not produce any change in intracellular Ca 2 +. Our results demonstrate that in preimplantation mouse embryos experimentally induced stage-specific changes of cell shape are accompanied by changes of intracellular free Ca 2 + and redistribution of the cytoskeleton-related proteins E-cadherin, fodrin, and calmodulin. We conclude that intracellular Ca 2 + specifically is involved in compaction and probably regulates the function and localization of cytoskeleton elements...|$|E
40|$|A {{uniaxial}} High-Velocity Compaction (HVC) {{process for}} polymer powder using a cylindrical, hardened steel die {{and a new}} technique with relaxation assist was tested {{with a focus on}} the compactibility characteristics and surface morphology of the compacted materials using various heights of relaxation assist device with different compacting profiles. Relaxation assist device was presented as a new technique to reduce springback, pull-out phenomenon and to improve the compaction process. The basic phenomena associated with HVC are explained and the general energy principle is introduced to explain pull-out phenomenon during the <b>decompacting</b> stage. In this study, polyamide- 11 powders with different particle size distributions have been compacted with the application of different compaction profiles, e. g. different energies and velocities. It was found that the relative green density is influenced more by the pre-compacting (primary compaction step) than by the post-compacting (secondary compaction step). Experimental results for different compaction profiles were presented showing the effect of varying the opposite velocity during the <b>decompacting</b> stage and how to improve the homogeneous densification between the upper and lower surface and the evenness of the upper surface of the compacted powder bed by using relaxation assists, and the influences of the relaxation assist device on the process characteristics. It was found that the relaxation assist improves the compaction of the polymer powder by locking the powder bed in the compacted form. In addition, the relative times of the compacting stage, <b>decompacting</b> stage and the reorganisation of the particles can be controlled by altering the height of the relaxation assist. It was found that the high-velocity compaction process is an interruption process and that the delay times between the pressure waves can be reduced by increasing the height of the relaxation assist device. Furthermore, the first gross instantaneous springback and the total elastic springback are reduced. Two bonding strain gauges and a high-speed video camera system were used to investigate the springback phenomenon during the compaction process. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and image computer board Camera (IC-PCI Imaging Technology) were used to the study the morphological characteristics, the limit of plastic deformation and particle bonding by plastic flow at contact points, and pull-out phenomena.

In year 1 barley was sown in both fields, underseeded with alfalfa in Field 1. The following year alfalfa was grown in Field 1 and corn using minimum tillage in field 2. Measurements included cone penetration resistance, dry bulk density, and crop yields. It was found that compaction had a significant effect on lowering yields.

It uses percussion to deliver mechanical energy into the frozen mixture, breaking up the ice and <b>decompacting</b> the soil so that only low reaction forces are required from a rover or spacecraft to push the sensor downward.

However, compaction of salt-marsh stratigraphies can cause post-depositional lowering (PDL) {{of the samples}} used to reconstruct sea level, creating an estimation of former sea level that is too low and a rate of rise that is too great. We estimated the contribution of compaction to late Holocene sea-level trends reconstructed at Tump Point, North Carolina, USA. We used a geotechnical model that was empirically calibrated by performing tests on surface sediments from modern depositional environments analogous to those encountered in the sediment core. The model generated depth-specific estimates of PDL, allowing samples {{to be returned to}} their depositional altitudes. After removing an estimate of land-level change, error-in-variables changepoint analysis of the <b>decompacted</b> and original sea-level reconstructions identified three trends. Compaction did not generate artificial sea-level trends and cannot be invoked as a causal mechanism for the features in the Tump Point record.

In this study an attempt of delineating what are or not geological features has been done by validating the seismic structural interpretation using the restoration technique which also provided information about the extensional history of the study area.

40|$|Erosion control {{treatments}} {{were applied}} to abandoned logging roads in California, {{with the goal of}} reducing road-related sediment input to streams and restoring natural hydrologic patterns on the landscape. Treatment of stream crossings involved excavating culverts and associated road fill and reshaping streambanks. A variety of techniques {{were applied to}} road benches, which included <b>decompacting</b> the road surface, placing unstable road fill in more stable locations, and reestablishing natural surface drainage patterns. Following treatment and a 12 -year recurrence-interval storm, some road reaches and excavated stream crossings showed evidence of mass movement failures, gullying, bank erosion and channel incision. Post-treatment erosion from excavated stream crossings was related to two variables: a surrogate for stream power (drainage area * channel gradient) and the volume of fill excavated from the channel. Post-treatment erosion on road reaches was related to four explanatory variables: method of treatment, hillslope position (upper, mid-slope or lower), date of treatment, and an interaction term (hillslope position * method of treatment). Sediment delivery from treated roads in upper, middle and lower hillslope positions was 10, 135, and 550 m of sediment/kilometer of 3 treated roads, respectively. In contrast, inventories of almost 500 km of forest roads in adjacent catchments indicate that untreated roads produced 1500 to 4700 m of sediment/km of road 3 length. Erosion from 300 km of treated roads contributed less than 2 percent of the total sediment load of Redwood Creek during the period 1978 to 1998. Although road removal treatments do not completely eliminate erosion associated with forest roads, they do substantially reduce sediment yields from abandoned logging roads...|$|E

Third generation artificial grass pitches have been observed to get harder over time. The maintenance technique of rubber infill decompaction is intended to help slow, or reverse, this process. At present, little is understood about either the science of the infill compaction process or the efficacy of decompaction maintenance. The objective of this study was to measure the changes in rubber infill net bulk density, force reduction (impact absorption) and vertical ball rebound under various levels of compactive effort in controlled laboratory-based testing. The assessments were repeated after the systems had been raked to simulate the decompaction maintenance techniques. These tests defined the limits of compaction (loose to maximally compacted) in terms of the change in rubber infill net bulk density, force reduction and vertical ball rebound. Site testing was also undertaken at four third generation pitches immediately pre and post decompaction, to determine the measurable effects in the less well controlled field environment. Rubber infill net bulk density was found to increase as compactive effort increased, resulting in increased hardness. <b>Decompacting</b> the surface was found to approximately fully reverse these effects. In comparison, the site measurements demonstrated similar but notably smaller magnitudes of change following the decompaction process suggesting that the field state pre and post decompaction did not reach the extremes obtained in the laboratory. The findings suggest that rubber infill net bulk density is an important parameter influencing the hardness of artificial grass and that decompactions can be an effective method to reverse compaction related hardness changes...|$|E

Imaging and pathologic analysis suggest that changes in white matter myelination may underlie both the enlargement of white matter tracts that contributes to megancephaly, and/or hyper-intense signals visualized on MRI. To study the role(s) of Nf 1 and HRasin oligodendrocytes, we examined the optic nerve and corpus callosum,myelinated fiber tracts. We studiedNf 1 heterozygous mice,tamoxifen-induced Nf 1 loss in mature oligodendrocytes (Plp-CreERT), and a new transgenic model in which the CNPase promoter drives expression of HRasG 12 V. Activated HRas and loss of Nf 1 within oligo-lineage cells (PLPCre; Nf 1 fl+; 2 ̆ 6 PLPCre; Nf 1 fl/fl) resulted in optic nerve enlargement. The corpus callosum of CNP-HRasG 12 V mice was also enlarged. Electron microscopy analysis revealed 3 phenotypes within the enlarged optic nerves. 1) When Nf 1 was lost or HRas was activated within oligodendrocytes, the myelin was <b>decompacted</b> due to splitting at the intraperiod lines. The transgenic Nf 1 +/- mice, in which Nf 1 loss is not restricted to oligo-lineage cells, displayed lesser myelin decompaction, and these mice did not have significantly enlarged optic nerves. 2) Enlarged axons accompanied the <b>decompacted</b> myelin within all models. 3) All Nf 1 and Ras mouse models also showed {{an expansion of the}} perivascular astrocyticendfeet surrounding the vasculature.

We {{show that the}} interaction of the ALC 1 macrodomain with the ATPase module mediates auto-inhibition. PARP 1 activation suppresses this inhibitory interaction. Crucially, release from auto-inhibition requires a poly-ADP-ribose (PAR) binding macrodomain.

ALC 1 fragments lacking the regulatory macrodomain relax chromatin in vivo without requiring PARP 1 activation. Further, the ATPase restricts the macrodomain’s interaction with PARP 1 under non-DNA damage conditions. Somatic cancer mutants disrupt ALC 1 ’s auto-inhibition and activate chromatin remodeling.

In the absence of Rec 8, chromosomes were <b>decompacted</b> relative to those of wild-type cells. Conversely, loss of the cohesin-associated protein Pds 5 resulted in hypercompaction. Although this hypercompaction requires Rec 8, binding of Rec 8 to chromatin was reduced in the absence of Pds 5, indicating that Pds 5 promotes chromosome association of Rec 8. To explain these observations, we propose that meiotic prophase chromosomes are organized as chromatin loops emanating from a Rec 8 -containing axis: the absence of Rec 8 disrupts the axis, resulting in disorganized chromosomes, whereas reduced Rec 8 loading results in a longitudinally compacted axis with fewer attachment points and longer chromatin loops...|$|R

We have isolated, characterized, and mutated a previously undescribed mouse gene, Traube (Trb), essential for preimplantation development. Similar protein coding sequences are found in rats, humans, and yeast. The TRB protein contained two amino-terminal acidic domains, a leucine zipper, and three putative nuclear localization signals. The Trb gene was expressed at low levels ubiquitously early in development and became restricted to the liver and the central nervous system from E 11. 5 onward. Myc-tagged TRB protein was localized to the nucleus, and in {{a large proportion of the}} cells to the nucleoli. The Trb mutant embryos halted in development at the compacted morula stage at E 2. 5. At E 3. 5 they started to <b>decompact</b> and a day later they disintegrated and died. The observed defect was cell autonomous, as mutant cells failed to participate in the formation of chimeric embryos. The Trb mutant embryos showed a 50 % reduction of the total cell number. The mutant embryos exhibited a paucity of ribosomes, polyribosomes, and rough endoplasmic reticulum. This paucity of ribosomes together with the localization of TRB to the nucleoli, the site of ribosome synthesis, suggests that TRB is involved in the synthesis of ribosomes...|$|R
40|$|Growing {{demand for}} land in dry {{tropical}} zones is increasing pressure to use sandy soils, despite their low fertility {{which is due to}} a lack of organic matter, minerals and moisture. Now scientists in Thailand have developed a new method to increase their fertility. The simple method involves digging grooves 10 cm wide in between a crop s planting rows, and digging deep enough to break through the compacted layer which is normally found at 25 cm depth in sandy soils. The grooves, 40 cm apart, are then filled with the <b>decompacted</b> soil. This allows the plant s root system to grow in the grooves and to draw sustenance from the minerals and moisture that often lie below the compacted layer. Trials have shown significant increases in yield of such crops as cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), maize (Zea mays) and Brazilian lucerne grass (Styloxanthes guianensis).

40|$|An {{open and}} decondensed {{chromatin}} organization is a defining property of pluripotency. Several epigenetic regulators have {{been implicated in}} maintaining an open chromatin organization, but how these processes {{are connected to the}} pluripotency network is unknown. Here, we identified a new role for the transcription factor NANOG as a key regulator connecting the pluripotency network with constitutive heterochromatin organization in mouse embryonic stem cells. Deletion of Nanog leads to chromatin compaction and the remodeling of heterochromatin domains. Forced expression of NANOG in epiblast stem cells is sufficient to <b>decompact</b> chromatin. NANOG associates with satellite repeats within heterochromatin domains, contributing to an architecture characterized by highly dispersed chromatin fibers, low levels of H 3 K 9 me 3, and high major satellite transcription, and the strong transactivation domain of NANOG is required for this organization. The heterochromatin-associated protein SALL 1 is a direct cofactor for NANOG, and loss of Sall 1 recapitulates the Nanog-null phenotype, but the loss of Sall 1 can be circumvented through direct recruitment of the NANOG transactivation domain to major satellites. These results establish a direct connection between the pluripotency network and chromatin organization and emphasize that maintaining an open heterochromatin architecture is a highly regulated process in embryonic stem cells.

40|$|Compaction of the Escherichia coli {{nucleoid}} in the cell’s centre {{was associated}} with the loss of colony-forming ability; these effects were caused by induction of Cyt 1 Aa, the cytotoxic 27 kDa protein from Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis. Cyt 1 Aa-affected compaction of the nucleoids was delayed but eventually more intense than compaction caused by chloramphenicol. The possibility that small, compact nucleoids in Cyt 1 Aa-expressing cells resulted in DNA replication run-out and segregation following cell division was ruled out by measuring relative nucleoid length. Treatments with membrane-perforating substances other than Cyt 1 Aa did not cause such compaction of the nucleoids, but rather the nucleoids overexpanded to occupy nearly all of the cell volume. These findings support the suggestion that, in addition to its perforating ability, Cyt 1 Aa causes specific disruption of nucleoid associations with the cytoplasmic membrane. In situ immunofluorescence labelling with Alexa did not demonstrate a great amount of Cyt 1 Aa associated with the membrane. Clear separation between Alexa-labelled Cyt 1 Aa and 49, 6 -diamidino- 2 -phenylindole (DAPI) -stained DNA indicates that the nucleoid does not bind Cyt 1 Aa. Around 2 h after induction, nucleoids in Cyt 1 Aa-expressing cells started to <b>decompact</b> and expanded to fill the whole cell volume, most likely due to partial cell lysis without massive peptidoglycan destruction...|$|R
