In the ensuing months after the election, various Republicans asserted that Perot had acted as a spoiler, enough {{to the detriment of}} Bush to lose him the election. While many disaffected conservatives may have voted <b>for</b> <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> to protest Bush's tax increase, further examination of the Perot vote in the Election Night exit polls not only showed that Perot siphoned votes nearly equally among Bush and Clinton, but of the voters who cited Bush's broken [...] "No New Taxes" [...] pledge as [...] "very important," [...] two thirds voted for Bill Clinton.|$|E
500|$|The {{day after}} McCain announced, Bush {{made a show}} of visiting Phoenix and {{displaying}} that he, not McCain, had the endorsement of Arizona Governor Jane Dee Hull and several other prominent local political figures. [...] McCain did have the support {{of the rest of the}} Republican Arizona congressional delegation. [...] Hull would continue to attack McCain during the campaign, and was featured in high-profile Arizona Republic and New York Times stories about McCain's reputation for having a bad temper, with the latter featuring on-the-record criticism from Governor of Michigan John Engler. [...] By early November, stories about McCain's temper problem were frequent enough that Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz wrote a survey article about them. [...] Some of McCain's opponents, including those in or close to the Senate Republican leadership, intimated that McCain's temper was a sign of mental instability. [...] The notion that this was due to McCain's POW days caused Admiral James Stockdale, a fellow former POW and 1992 vice-presidential candidate <b>for</b> <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot,</b> to write an op-ed piece for The New York Times, [...] "John McCain in the Crucible". In it, Stockdale said that the reverse was true: that the experience of resisting during the POW experience made former POWs more emotionally stable in later life, not less. [...] In early December, McCain released some 1,500pages of his medical and psychiatric records, which showed several psychiatric evaluations over a number of years following his POW release that indicated no signs of lingering mental or emotional difficulty from that period.|$|E

In the ensuing months after the election, various Republicans asserted that Perot had acted as a spoiler, enough {{to the detriment of}} Bush to lose him the election. While many disaffected conservatives may have voted <b>for</b> <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> to protest Bush's tax increase, further examination of the Perot vote in the Election Night exit polls not only showed that Perot siphoned votes nearly equally among Bush and Clinton, but roughly two-thirds of those voters who cited Bush's broken [...] "No New Taxes" [...] pledge as [...] "very important" [...] (25%) [...] voted for Bill Clinton. The voting numbers reveal that to win the electoral vote Bush would have had to win 10 of the 11 states Clinton won by less than five percentage points. For Bush to earn a majority of the popular vote, he would have needed 12.2% of Perot's 18.9% of the vote, 65% of Perot's support base. State exit polls suggested that Perot did not alter the electoral college count, except potentially in one state (Ohio), which nonetheless showed a result in the margin of error. Furthermore, Perot was most popular in states that strongly favored either Clinton or Bush, limiting his real electoral impact for either candidate. He gained relatively little support in the Southern states and happened to have the best showing in states with few electoral votes. Perot appealed to disaffected voters all across the political spectrum who had grown weary of the two-party system. NAFTA played a role in Perot's support, and Perot voters were relatively moderate on hot-button social issues.|$|E

40|$|The {{liberalization}} of trade in goods, capital, and services {{has played a}} major role in the transformation of the world economy of the past twenty-five years. The redistribution of resources that has followed this transformation has been experienced differently in different parts of the world and by different groups of people. There have thus been winners and losers in the first, second, and third worlds alike, depending on ability to compete in this global field. Not surprisingly then, attitudes to free trade and the free movement of capital have varied across countries and across groups of the population. Although the population's attitudes usually play a secondary role in shaping trade policy, they sometimes have significant political ramifications (e. g. support for political parties that oppose free trade agreements, illustrated by support <b>for</b> <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> in the early 90 s or the French population's rejection of the European Union Constitution in 2005). The article addresses the question of whether public opinion attitudes to free trade match the social and national geographies of benefits and losses as most economists and political economists predict or whether, instead, they obey an alternative economic logic. The puzzle that prompts our interest in the issue of attitudes to trade is the observation in several empirical studies of a negative relationshi...|$|E
