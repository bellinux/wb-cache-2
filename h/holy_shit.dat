In 1972 he published the manifesto Your window right — your tree duty.

He wrote numerous manifestos, lectured and designed posters in favor of nature protection, including against nuclear power, to save the oceans and the whales and to protect the rain forest. He was also an advocate of composting toilets and the principle of constructed wetland. He perceived feces not as nauseous but as part of the cycle of nature.

25|$|The duo is {{reassigned to}} a revived scheme from the 1980s, {{which specializes in}} infiltrating high schools. Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) assigns them to contain the spread of a {{synthetic}} drug called HFS (<b>Holy</b> Fucking <b>Shit)</b> at Sagan High School. He gives them new identities and enrolls them as students, giving them class schedules fitting their previous academic performances; Jenko taking mostly arts and humanities, and Schmidt taking mostly science classes, but the duo mixes up their identities. Schmidt gets a lead on HFS from classmate Molly (Brie Larson), and he and Jenko meet the school's main dealer, popular student Eric (Dave Franco). The two take HFS {{in front of him}} to maintain their cover. After experiencing the drug's effects, the duo discovers that Schmidt's intelligence now makes him popular, while Jenko's lax attitude is frowned upon.|$|R
5000|$|... "For most poets-who-sing or singers-who-poet, {{the blues}} is a shirt {{to be worn}} instead of a whole wardrobe. But Rux {{is rooted in the}} blues, both musically and philosophically. “Geneva” {{features}} Dave Tronzo’s slinky slide guitar and Marcelle Lashey’s heroic testifying, both of which play perfectly against Rux’ tale of a hairdresser who somehow seems like the legendary Greek heroine Atalanta. Even during the Eno/Fripp/Bowie atmospheric cloud of “My Brother’s Hands (Union Song)”, collaborator Jaco van Schalkwyk starts to add congas and backup layers until everything simmers, and then Rux pours his vocabulary all over everything like gravy. Rux is the least pretentious of pretentious poets—he even has the courtesy to introduce the protest song “I Can’t Write Left-Handed” with a brief spoken intro giving props to composer Bill Withers, right before he sings the <b>holy</b> living <b>shit</b> out of the song. Just listening to it makes my eyes fill up, especially since it seems like this god damned war in Iraq is never going to end. Carl Hancock Rux is out there, making things weird and lovely and furious and deep. If it might not be your cup of tea, maybe you need to drink something besides tea for a change."POPMATTERS ...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, the {{swearing}} {{becomes more}} popular day by day. As a result, {{there are many}} educated people also use it to express their feelings when they are anger, upset, stress, and hurt. It is the same of what Todd Phillips tells in his movie “The Hangover”. The aim {{of this research is}} to describe swearing, types of swearing and to know the most dominant swearing expressed by Phil Wenneck as a school teacher in “The Hangover” movie directed by Todd Phillips. In conducting this research, the researcher used a descriptive qualitative research design to analyzed the data. All the data in this research were taken from the conversation among the characters, especially by Phil Wenneck (a school teacher) and his friends in “The Hangover” movie which were considered as swearing. Since this research was a qualitative research, the main instrument of this research was the researcher herself. For analyzing the data the researcher used some steps, firstly, the researcher tabulated all swearing expressed by Phil Wenneck in “The Hangover” movie directed by Todd Phillips. Secondly, she categorized the types of swearing expressed by Phil Wenneck in “The Hangover” movie. Lastly, she decided the most dominant of swearing expressed by Phil Wenneck in that movie. The result of this study showed that Phil Wenneck in “The Hangover” movie directed by Todd Phillips used ninety five swearings for showing up his awe, anger, upset, stress, and hurt such as fucked up, <b>holy</b> <b>shit,</b> Jesus, goddamn, shit!, and so on. Secondly, Phil Wenneck used some types of swearing in “The Hangover” movie based on Steven Pinker`s theory, such as: descriptive swearing, idiomatic swearing, abusive swearing, emphatic swearing, and cathartic swearing. Thirdly, Phil Wenneck used “shit” swearing as the most dominant swearing in “The Hangover” movie. Finally, it was proved that swearing was also spoken by people who have high and well education. We cannot judge someone who uses obscene words to swear other people as people who are impolite, do not have high and well education. In relation with that theory, it is clear that someone used swearing for different reason and purposes...|$|E
