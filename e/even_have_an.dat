5|$|The {{length and}} {{internal}} structure of Peking-opera plays is highly variable. Prior to 1949, zhezixi, short plays or plays {{made up of}} short scenes from longer plays, were often performed. These plays usually center on one simple situation or feature a selection of scenes designed to include {{all four of the}} main Peking opera skills and showcase the virtuosity of the performers. This format has become less prevalent in recent times, but plays of one act are still performed. These short works, as well as individual scenes within longer works, are marked by an emotional progression {{from the beginning of the}} play to the end. For example, the concubine in the one act play The Favorite Concubine Becomes Intoxicated begins in a state of joy, and then moves to anger and jealousy, drunken playfulness, and finally to a feeling of defeat and resignation. A full-length play usually has from six to fifteen or more scenes. The overall story in these longer works is told through contrasting scenes. Plays will alternate between civil and martial scenes, or scenes involve protagonists and antagonists. There are several major scenes within the work that follow the pattern of emotional progression. It is these scenes that are usually excerpted for later zhezixi productions. Some of the most complex plays may <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> emotional progression from scene to scene.|$|E
25|$|Labyrinth of Reflections, a book heavily {{based on}} various {{internet}} subcultures and cyberpunk mythos, is another product of this period. Although Labyrinth is often labeled as cyberpunk, it {{is a rather}} straight romance story, hardly meeting Dozois criterion, and, more to the fact, was written when the author did not <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> Internet connection; all his internet knowledge was limited to FIDONet membership.|$|E
25|$|One type of {{device that}} {{integrates}} CobraNet {{is the audio}} DSP. As self-powered speakers became more common, Cobranet was frequently used to distribute the audio signal from the DSP. These devices typically receive audio from CobraNet (and often from other digital or analog sources simultaneously), and process the audio using digital filters and effects (for example, volume control, EQ, compression, delay, crossovers, etc.) and then output the audio via CobraNet (or other digital or analog outputs). Some DSPs <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> integral telephone hybrid, and can incorporate CobraNet and other sources into a teleconferencing application.|$|E

25|$|Cities, like municipalities, are {{composed}} of barangays, which can range from urban neighborhoods (such as Brgy. 9, Santa Angela in Laoag), to rural communities (such as Brgy. Iwahig in Puerto Princesa). Barangays are sometimes grouped into officially defined administrative (geographical) districts. Examples of such are the cities of Manila (16 districts), Davao (11 districts), Iloilo (seven districts), and Samal (three districts: Babak, Kaputian and Peñaplata). Some cities such as Caloocan, Manila and Pasay <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> intermediate level between the district and barangay levels, called a zone. However, geographic districts and zones are not political units; there are no elected city government officials in these city-specific administrative levels. Rather they only serve to make city planning, statistics-gathering other administrative tasks easier and more convenient.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} few months of Apple's existence, it did not <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> office. Most of the company's {{business}} was conducted from the NEMS building. It was not until the autumn of 1967 that Apple finally opened a London office. Since the Beatles already owned a four-story building at 94 Baker Street that had been purchased as an investment property by their accountants, they decided that Baker Street was as good a location as any for Apple. In September they set up an office for Apple Publishing in the Baker Street building. With Epstein's death, there was nobody in the Beatles' inner circle with business acumen who could manage the company, and, as with their band affairs, the Beatles decided that they would manage it themselves.|$|E

2500|$|Assembly {{language}} {{has long been}} the primary development language for many popular home computers of the 1980s and 1990s (such as the MSX, [...] Sinclair ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Commodore Amiga, and Atari ST). This was in large part because interpreted BASIC dialects on these systems offered insufficient execution speed, as well as insufficient facilities {{to take full advantage of}} the available hardware on these systems. Some systems <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> integrated development environment (IDE) with highly advanced debugging and macro facilities. Some compilers available for the Radio Shack TRS-80 and its successors had the capability to combine inline assembly source with high-level program statements. Upon compilation a built-in assembler produced inline machine code.|$|E
2500|$|In Japan, being cute is {{acceptable}} {{for men and}} women. A trend existed of men shaving their legs to mimic the neotenic look. Japanese women often try to act cute to attract men. A study by Kanebo, a cosmetic company, found that Japanese women in their 20s and 30s favored the [...] "cute look" [...] with a [...] "childish round face". Women also employ a look of innocence {{in order to further}} play out this idea of cuteness. Having large eyes is one aspect that exemplifies innocence; therefore many Japanese women attempt to alter the size of their eyes. To create this illusion, women may wear large contact lenses, false eyelashes, dramatic eye makeup, and <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> East Asian blepharoplasty, commonly known as double eyelid surgery.|$|E

Battling against the Takeda, and Hojo clans made Yoshimoto and his soldiers experienced. Imagawa was an amazing diplomat, eventually securing key alliances with them, and after vassalizing the Matsudaira clan of the famed Tokugawa Ieyasu; Imagawa Yoshimoto was considered the strongest Daimyo in the Tokaido. Imagawa Yoshimoto enjoyed a strong position, and wanted to be Shogun, he was said to <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> obsession with shaving his eyebrows, and blacking his teeth like a Kyoto Noble. He was one of the dominant daimyōs in Japan until his death in 1560 after trying to march on the capital to become Shogun. He was killed in the village of Dengakuhazama in Okehazama by Oda Nobunaga, who would become the first unifier of Japan.|$|E
2500|$|In sensory neurons, an {{external}} signal such as pressure, temperature, light, or sound is {{coupled with the}} opening and closing of ion channels, which in turn alter the ionic permeabilities of the membrane and its voltage. These voltage changes can again be excitatory (depolarizing) or inhibitory (hyperpolarizing) and, in some sensory neurons, their combined effects can depolarize the axon hillock enough to provoke action potentials. [...] Examples in humans include the olfactory receptor neuron and Meissner's corpuscle, which are critical for the sense of smell and touch, respectively. [...] However, not all sensory neurons convert their external signals into action potentials; some do not <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> axon! Instead, they may convert the signal into {{the release of a}} neurotransmitter, or into continuous graded potentials, either of which may stimulate subsequent neuron(s) into firing an action potential. [...] For illustration, in the human ear, hair cells convert the incoming sound into the opening and closing of mechanically gated ion channels, which may cause neurotransmitter molecules to be released. In similar manner, in the human retina, the initial photoreceptor cells and the next layer of cells (comprising bipolar cells and horizontal cells) do not produce action potentials; only some amacrine cells and the third layer, the ganglion cells, produce action potentials, which then travel up the optic nerve.|$|E

6000|$|There {{is nothing}} in this, perhaps, which Christ might not have said except the abominable metaphysical modernism of [...] "the spirit world"; {{but to say that}} it is {{recorded}} that He did say it, is like saying it is recorded that He preferred palm trees to sycamores. It is a simple and unadulterated untruth. The author should know that these words have meant a thousand things to a thousand people, and that if more ancient sects had paraphrased them as cheerfully as he, he would never have had the text upon which he founds his theory. In a pamphlet in which plain printed words cannot be left alone, it is not surprising if there are mis-statements upon larger matters. Here is a statement clearly and philosophically laid down which we can only content ourselves with flatly denying: [...] "The fifth rule of our Lord is that we should take special pains to cultivate the same kind of regard for people of foreign countries, and for those generally who do not belong to us, or <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> antipathy to us, which we already entertain towards our own people, and those who are in sympathy with us." [...] I should very much like to know where in the whole of the New Testament the author finds this violent, unnatural, and immoral proposition. Christ did not have the same kind of regard for one person as for another. We are specifically told that there were certain persons whom He specially loved. It is most improbable that He thought of other nations as He thought of His own. The sight of His national city moved Him to tears, and the highest compliment He paid was, [...] "Behold an Israelite indeed." [...] The author has simply confused two entirely distinct things. Christ commanded us to have love for all men, but even if we had equal love for all men, to speak of having the same love for all men is merely bewildering nonsense. If we love a man at all, the impression he produces on us must be vitally different to the impression produced by another man whom we love. To speak of having the same kind of regard for both is about as sensible as asking a man whether he prefers chrysanthemums or billiards. Christ did not love humanity; He never said He loved humanity; He loved men. Neither He nor anyone else can love humanity; it is like loving a gigantic centipede. And the reason that the Tolstoians can even endure to think of an equally distributed affection is that their love of humanity is a logical love, a love into which they are coerced by their own theories, a love which would be an insult to a tom-cat.|$|E

60|$|And, {{like all}} fine arts, {{it must be}} based upon a broad, solid sincerity, which, like a law of Nature, rules an {{infinity}} of different phenomena. Your endeavour must be single-minded. You would talk differently to a coal-heaver and to a professor. But is this duplicity? I deny it. The truth consists in the genuineness of the feeling, in the genuine recognition of the two men, so similar and so different, as your two partners in the hazard of life. Obviously, a humbug, thinking only of winning his little race, would stand a chance of profiting by his artifices. Men, professors or coal-heavers, are easily deceived; they <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> extraordinary knack of lending themselves to deception, a sort of curious and inexplicable propensity to {{allow themselves to be}} led by the nose with their eyes open. But a ship is a creature which we have brought into the world, as it were on purpose to keep us up to the mark. In her handling a ship will not put up with a mere pretender, as, for instance, the public will do with Mr. X, the popular statesman, Mr. Y, the popular scientist, or Mr. Z, the popular--what shall we say?--anything from a teacher of high morality to a bagman--who have won their little race. But I would like (though not accustomed to betting) to wager a large sum that not one of the few first-rate skippers of racing yachts has ever been a humbug. It would have been too difficult. The difficulty arises from the fact that one does not deal with ships in a mob, but with a ship as an individual. So we may have to do with men. But in each of us there lurks some particle of the mob spirit, of the mob temperament. No matter how earnestly we strive against each other, we remain brothers on the lowest side of our intellect and in the instability of our feelings. With ships it is not so. Much as they are to us, they are nothing to each other. Those sensitive creatures have no ears for our blandishments. It takes something more than words to cajole them to do our will, to cover us with glory. Luckily, too, or else there would have been more shoddy reputations for first-rate seamanship. Ships have no ears, I repeat, though, indeed, I think I have known ships who really seemed to have had eyes, or else I cannot understand on what ground a certain 1,000-ton barque of my acquaintance on one particular occasion refused to answer her helm, thereby saving a frightful smash to two ships and to a very good man's reputation. I knew her intimately for two years, and in no other instance either before or since have I known her to do that thing. The man she had served so well (guessing, perhaps, at the depths of his affection for her) I have known much longer, and in bare justice to him I must say that this confidence-shattering experience (though so fortunate) only augmented his trust in her. Yes, our ships have no ears, and thus they cannot be deceived. I would illustrate my idea of fidelity as between man and ship, between the master and his art, by a statement which, though it might appear shockingly sophisticated, is really very simple. I would say that a racing-yacht skipper who thought of nothing else but the glory of winning the race would never attain to any eminence of reputation. The genuine masters of their craft--I say this confidently from my experience of ships-- have thought of nothing but of doing their very best by the vessel under their charge. To forget one's self, to surrender all personal feeling in the service of that fine art, is the only way for a seaman to the faithful discharge of his trust.|$|E
