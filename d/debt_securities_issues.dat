40|$|In this article, {{we study}} {{the choice of}} issuer {{location}} and regulatory competition in the European corporate debt market. We find that, in absolute terms, Germany has by far the highest outflow of debt issues, while the Netherlands, the UK, Luxembourg and Ireland see the most inflows (in that order). We use a panel gravity model to investigate country specific factors attracting foreign subsidiaries as issuer. The data clearly support the prediction that the locational choice is positively influenced by a low withholding tax rate. There is also some evidence that corporate tax rates play a role. We do not find support for creditor protection rules in bankruptcy as a driver of cross-border <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> <b>issues.</b> Hence, countries who wish to attract issuers are well-advised to reduce their withholding tax rates – creditor rights seem not to matter...|$|E
40|$|The study {{investigates the}} impact of debt {{securities}} issuance on equity market behaviour of the issuers. The event study results reveal that overall debt securities issuers experience increase in equity return following debt securities issuance and decrease in systematic risk while total risk remain unchanged. Further examination of the 100 debt securities issuing companies found significant differences between hybrid and non-hybrid debf securifies issues. Hybrid debt securities experience significant fall in equity returns and systematic risk but an increase in total risk. Non-hybrid <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> <b>issues,</b> however; are found to have no impact on equity market behaviour. Findings of the study imply that general decline in systematic risk for debt securities issuing company could motivate issuance of debt securities and thus improve market liquidity.

40|$|Abstract: The {{scope of}} this article is to point out the {{features}} of European corporate bond market, in particular its development since the euro introduction. We structured our paper on chapters that present its economic importance, the implications of the common currency in respect to its growth and the level of integration in the present context. This market, including the <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> <b>issued</b> by non-financial corporations, non-monetary financial corporations and monetary financial institutions, is economically important, as it contributes to the allocation of funds to their most profitable uses. Its rapid growth since the introduction of the euro can be explained by developments in economic activity, the costs of issuance and mergers &acquisitions-related activity. The adoption of the common currency had a direct and permanent effect on <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> <b>issued</b> by non-monetary financial corporations. However, the use of corporate bonds at the euro area level is not uniform across countries. Country-specific factors continue to matter, despite the fact that financial markets are gradually becoming more integrated. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{accumulation}} of international reserves by emerging markets {{raises the question}} of how to best utilize these funds.

Second, a portion of the reserve pool along with borrowed funds could be used to purchase contingent <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> <b>issued</b> by governments and corporations, helping to solve the first-mover problem that limits the liquidity of markets in these instruments and hinders their acceptance by private investors.

Commercial and industrial (C) lending potential has expanded with the adoption of syndication practices, allowing credit risks to be spread across {{a greater number of}} participating banks and non-bank lenders.

CLOs allow loans to be financed primarily with high-rated <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> <b>issued</b> to institutions like mutual funds, pension funds, and insurance companies.

40|$|The {{effect of}} a change in capital {{structure}} on the risk and return of common stockholders is investigated. Also, the information content of dividends when a firm goes for new outside financing is examined. Data used in the study are collected from the Moody's Bond Survey, the Prentice Hall's Capital Adjustments, the Wall Street Journal Index, and the Center for Research in Security Prices Tape. The study uses an event study methodology. The risk (beta) of common stock before an issuance of <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> is compared with the risk after the issue. The stock market reaction to the issuance of new <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> is measured using after-the-event risk. The information content of dividend announcement before a new debt issue is compared to that of after the issue. The findings show that debt issue reduces stock holders' risk if the issuer is a dividend paying company. Also, <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> <b>issued</b> through an exchange offer increase stockholders' wealth. Finally, issuance of new debt does not affect the information content of dividends...|$|R

40|$|Enhancements to the BIS <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> {{statistics}} 1 The BIS has revised its <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> {{statistics to}} enhance their comparability across different markets. International issues have been redefined as <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> <b>issued</b> outside the market where the borrower resides, and statistics combining international and domestic issues are being released for the first time. The revised statistics highlight the growing size and internationalisation of bond markets. JEL classification: F 34, G 15. The internationalisation of bond markets has made {{it increasingly difficult to}} distinguish between international and domestic <b>debt</b> <b>securities.</b> The BIS has thus revised its methodology for classifying international issues, focusing now on the market of issue instead of the targeted investor base. In addition, the BIS has harmonised classifications with those in the Handbook on Securities Statistics and released for the first time data on total <b>debt</b> <b>securities.</b> This special feature outlines the reasons for these changes and discusses their impact on the statistics. Conceptual challenges The BIS has since the mid- 1980 s published statistics on borrowing activity in debt capital markets. Coverage has improved steadily over the years, expanding from the initial focus on international markets to cover more than 50 domestic markets as well. At the same time, changes in financial markets have challenged the usefulness of the statistics for financial stability analysis. 2 In particular, the growing size and diversity of <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> markets have heightened the importance of comparable data across markets. Furthermore, the growing openness of local markets to foreign investors and issuers has blurred the distinction between international and domestic <b>debt</b> <b>securities...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{trend toward}} {{incorporating}} information derived from financial markets {{into the bank}} supervision process has gained momentum {{over the past several}} years. This in part reflects an evolution in the thinking about how private market information can contribute to the process. In light of the evolving view of the potential contributions of market information, this paper reviews the empirical evidence relevant to the usefulness of financial market information in the bank supervision process. This paper reviews the research on what information can be gleaned from the pricing of equity and <b>debt</b> <b>securities</b> <b>issued</b> by banking organizations. The weight of the research leaves little room for doubt that financial market signals reflect underlying bank risk and that market evaluations of the risk of individual banking organizations are strongly correlated with supervisory findings. The evidence {{on the extent to which}} market signals can augment the information set of bank supervisors is more subtle, but overall it demonstrates that financial market signals should play a role in the bank supervision process. 1...|$|R
