5|$|The house sparrow's main predators are {{cats and}} birds of prey, {{but many other}} animals prey on them, {{including}} corvids, squirrels, and even humans—the house sparrow has been consumed in the past by people {{in many parts of}} the world, and <b>it</b> <b>still</b> <b>is</b> in parts of the Mediterranean. Most species of birds of prey have been recorded preying on the house sparrow in places where records are extensive. Accipiters and the merlin in particular are major predators, though cats are likely to have a greater impact on house sparrow populations. The house sparrow is also a common victim of roadkill; on European roads, it is the bird most frequently found dead.|$|E

25|$|A {{significant}} milestone of the Tang {{period of}} Xinjiang {{was that it}} {{marked the end of}} Indo-European influence in Xinjiang. This was partially spurred by Chinese policies, which unintentionally sped the turkification of Xinjiang, rather than the sinification that had occurred in other territories conquered by the Tang. The Tang dynasty recruited a large number of Turkic soldiers and generals, and the Chinese garrisons of Xinjiang were for the most part staffed by Turks rather than those of the Han ethnicity. Xinjiang was beginning its transition into a region that is linguistically and culturally Turko-Mongolic, which <b>it</b> <b>still</b> <b>is</b> to this day.|$|E

25|$|Meta-diethynylbenzene dianion is a {{structural}} isomer of Ortho-diethynylbenzene dianion.

Like Ortho-diethynylbenzene dianion, Meta-diethynylbenzene dianion exists in the gas state, contrary to the other bases and superbase which exist in the solution state. In Meta-diethynylbenzene dianion, the two negatively charged ethynyl (C2H2-) groups are bonded to the first and third carbon atoms of the benzene ring. But in Ortho-diethynylbenzene dianion, the ethynyl groups are bonded to the first and second carbon atoms of the benzene ring. Like Ortho-diethynylbenzene dianion, Meta-diethynylbenzene dianion has no known use.|$|E

25|$|There {{has been}} a public park at Duppas Hill since 1865, when the Croydon Board of Health bought land from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners for £2,000 to create Croydon's first {{recreation}} ground. It was laid out with paths, a bandstand, pavilion and an ornate drinking fountain. The Board of Health {{had to deal with}} cattle trespassing, drinking booths and other problems. The Board had proposed enclosing it with iron posts and railings intending to turn the area into a park rather than a recreation ground for all to enjoy sports and games freely, and in particular aimed to restrict horse-riding. Some of the Board wanted to ban horse-riding completely on the public open space, others to ban grooms exercising horses but not the general public riding for pleasure. Sir Francis Head, a famous soldier who lived at Duppas Hall overlooking the park, chaired a large public meeting to prevent the enclosure, wrote letters and memoranda to the press and headed a memorial of 3,500 people protesting against enclosure. He argued that the horse riders protected defenceless ladies, but he was eventually satisfied with notices forbidding people from exercising their horses, with Duppas Hill becoming the space for recreation <b>it</b> <b>still</b> <b>is</b> today.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} approach called analyzer-based imaging was first explored in 1995 by Viktor Ingal and Elena Beliaevskaya at the X-ray laboratory in Saint Petersburg, Russia, and by Tim Davis {{and colleagues at}} the CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation) Division of Material Science and Technology in Clayton, Australia. This method uses a Bragg crystal as angular filter to reflect {{only a small part}} of the beam fulfilling the Bragg condition onto a detector. Important contributions to the progress of this method have been made by a US collaboration of the research teams of Dean Chapman, Zhong Zhong and William Thomlinson, for example the extracting of an additional signal caused by ultra-small angle scattering and the first CT image made with analyzer-based imaging. An alternative to analyzer-based imaging, which provides equivalent results without requiring the use of a crystal, was developed by Alessandro Olivo and co-workers at the Elettra synchrotron in Trieste, Italy. This method, called “edge-illumination”, operates a fine selection on the X-ray direction by using the physical edge of the detector pixels themselves, hence the name. Later on Olivo, in collaboration with Robert Speller at University College London, adapted the method for use with conventional X-ray sources, opening the way to translation into clinical and other applications. Peter Munro (from the University of Western Australia) substantially contributed to the development of the lab-based approach, by demonstrating that it imposes practically no coherence requirements and that, this notwithstanding, <b>it</b> <b>still</b> <b>is</b> fully quantitative.|$|E
