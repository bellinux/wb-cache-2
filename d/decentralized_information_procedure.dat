40|$|Abstract—This paper proposes an {{alternative}} approach {{to address the problem}} of coordinating behaviors in mobile robot navigation: fusion of control signals. Such approach is based on a set of two <b>decentralized</b> <b>information</b> filters, which accomplish the data fusion involved. Besides these two fusion engines, control architectures designed according to this approach also embed a set of different controllers that generate reference signals for the robot linear and angular speeds. Such signals are delivered to the two <b>decentralized</b> <b>information</b> filters, which estimate suitable overall reference signals for the robot linear and angular speeds, respectively. Thus, the background for designing such control architectures is provided by the nonlinear systems theory, which makes this approach different from any other yet proposed. This background also allows checking control architectures designed according to the proposed approach for stability. Such analysis is carried out in the paper, and shows that the robot always reaches its final destination, in spite of either obstacles along its path or the environment layout. As an example, a control architecture is designed to guide a mobile robot in an experiment, whose results allows checking the good performance of the control architecture and validating the design approach proposed as well.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Structured {{navigation}} {{is extremely}} important for supporting users' information-seeking tasks and understanding of online information spaces [1]. In a centralized environment, information architects (IAs) can provide such support by developing organization and navigation systems using standard techniques [2]. However, <b>decentralized</b> <b>information</b> sytems are becoming more prevalent due to improved content management tools and their potential advantages, such as greater flexibility and reduced costs [3]. These decentralized systems often lack structured navigation, leading to serious HCI problems such as hypertext disorientation [4]. "Who's My Daddy?"

40|$|We use a {{model of}} {{real-time}} <b>decentralized</b> <b>information</b> processing to understand how constraints on human information processing affect the returns to scale of organizations. We identify three informational (dis) economies of scale: diversification of heterogeneous risks (positive), sharing of information and of costs (positive), and crowding out of recent information due to information processing delay (negative). Because decision rules are endogenous, delay does not inexorably lead to decreasing returns to scale. However, returns {{are more likely to}} be decreasing when computation constraints, rather than sampling costs, limit the information upon which decisions are conditioned. The results illustrate how information processing constraints together with the requirement of informaitonal integration cause a breakdown of the replication arguments that have been used to establish nondecreasing technological returns to scale. returns to scale, real-time computation, <b>decentralized</b> <b>information</b> processing, organizations, bounded rationality...|$|R

The proposal consists in taking some least mean square estimates of the optical flow vector associated to a certain region of the image considered and to fuse them {{in order to get a}} more accurate final estimate of such a vector. Besides this, the way the initial least mean square estimates are obtained is also modified, by reducing the number of observations used to get each one of them, in order to make the overall algorithm faster. The idea is that such initial estimates can be rougher, once the fusion engine improves the accuracy of the final estimate, in the sense that the <b>decentralized</b> <b>information</b> filter generates a final estimate whose variance is lower than the smallest variance associated to the initial estimates...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model that}} distinguishes between <b>decentralized</b> <b>information</b> processing and <b>decentralized</b> decision making in organizations; it shows that decentralized decision making can be advantageous due to computational delay, {{even in the absence}} of communication costs. The key feature of the model, which makes this result possible, is that decisions in a stochastic control problem are calculated in real time by boundedly rational members of an administrative staff. The control problem is to allocate resources in a changing environment. We consider a class of hierarchical <b>procedures</b> in which <b>information</b> about payoffs flows up and is aggregated by the hierarchy, while allocations flow down and are disaggregated by the hierarchy. Nodes of the hierarchy correspond not to a single person but to decision-making units within which there may be <b>decentralized</b> <b>information</b> processing.

40|$|Abstract — We {{report a}} <b>decentralized,</b> vehicle-based {{extended}} <b>information</b> filter designed to enable single-beacon acoustic navigation of multiple underwater vehicles. In single-beacon navigation, ranges {{from a single}} reference beacon to a moving underwater vehicle are used {{in addition to the}} vehicle’s inertial navigation sensors to perform absolute (as opposed to relative) localization and navigation. For this implementation we assume a moving reference beacon from which range measurements are calculated using asynchronous acoustic data broadcasts that also contain information about the reference beacon’s position and recent sensor measurements. We assume that other than these acoustic data transmissions the vehicle has no knowledge of the beacon’s position or sensor measurements. This implementation allows the simultaneous navigation of multiple vehicles within acoustic range of the reference beacon. Within this framework we show that the <b>decentralized</b> <b>information</b> filter yields identical results to a centralized extended Kalman filter at the instant of each range measurement; in addition we show that between range measurements the results from the two filters differ only by linearization errors. We compare the state estimation results of the <b>decentralized</b> <b>information</b> filter to that of a centralized extended Kalman filter using a simulated data set. I...|$|R
