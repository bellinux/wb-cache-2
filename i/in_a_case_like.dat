5|$|Coinciding {{with the}} release of his Letters and Speeches of Oliver Cromwell in 1845, Thomas Carlyle was asked to view the head. He did not, and {{on the basis of a}} friend's visit, wrote a scathing {{dismissal}} of the authenticity of the head: “it has hair, flesh and beard, a written history bearing that it was procured for £100 (I think of bad debt) about 50 years ago...the whole affair appears to be fraudulent moonshine, an element not pleasant even to glance into, especially <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> Oliver's.” Fitzgibbons 2008, Pearson and Morant agree that Carlyle's dismissal was not based on any historical or scientific fact. Although Carlyle conceded that it was “the head of some decapitated man of distinction”, the only other known man of distinction to be embalmed and then decapitated in such a manner over the previous 200 years was Henry Ireton. George Rolleston had conducted an examination on another skull—called the Ashmolean skull—after claims that it was Cromwell's head. Rolleston was unconvinced by the skull's supposed history, and visited Wilkinson's home to see the skull shortly afterwards. After an examination, he dismissed the Ashmolean skull as a fake and declared that the Wilkinson head was the real head of Cromwell.|$|E

25|$|It {{may occur}} that systems of {{coordinates}} for two {{different sets of}} geometric figures are equivalent {{in terms of their}} analysis. An example of this is the systems of homogeneous coordinates for points and lines in the projective plane. The two systems <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> this are said to be dualistic. Dualistic systems have the property that results from one system can be carried over to the other since these results are only different interpretations of the same analytical result; this is known as the principle of duality.|$|E
2500|$|Not every {{subset of}} the sample space [...] must {{necessarily}} be considered an event: some of the subsets are simply not of interest, others cannot be [...] "measured". This is not so obvious <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> a coin toss. In a different example, one could consider javelin throw lengths, where the events typically are intervals like [...] "between 60 and 65 meters" [...] and unions of such intervals, but not sets like the [...] "irrational numbers between 60 and 65 meters" ...|$|E
2500|$|After an {{extensive}} analysis finding that truthful trial testimony was protected speech, which culminating in find a genuine factual dispute {{on the issue}} and thus overturning the summary judgement initially granted by the district court, Flaum echoed one of Scalia's criticisms in a footnote. [...] "Waters provides little direct guidance as to {{the division of labor}} between judge and jury <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> this one," [...] he observed. [...] "The critical question that, to this point, remains unanswered requires an assessment of the defendants' subjective motivation, a classic jury issue." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "In {{the final}} analysis," [...] he wrote, [...] "a Justice's vote <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> this depends more {{on his or}} her views about the {{respective}} lawmaking responsibilities of Congress and this Court than on conflicting policy interests. Judges who have confidence in their own ability to fashion public policy are less hesitant to change the law than {{those of us who are}} inclined to give wide latitude to the views of the voters' representatives on nonconstitutional matters." [...] While he had admittedly helped start the discussions about the various interpretations of Wilko in his dissent in Scherk v. Alberto-Culver, Inc. while chief judge of the Seventh Circuit, he said [...] "one of these arguments, however, carries sufficient weight to tip the balance between judicial and legislative authority and overturn an interpretation of an Act of Congress that has been settled for many years." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{choosing}} the surface Σ(t), the restrictions are that (i) {{it has to}} be bounded by a closed curve around which the EMF is to be found, and (ii) it has to capture the relative motion of all moving parts of the circuit. It is emphatically not required that the bounding curve corresponds to a physical line of flow of the current. On the other hand, induction is all about relative motion, and the path emphatically must capture any relative motion. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>like</b> Figure 1 where a portion of the current path is distributed over a region in space, the EMF driving the current can be found using a variety of paths. Figure 2 shows two possibilities. All paths include the obvious return loop, but in the disc two paths are shown: one is a geometrically simple path, the other a tortuous one. We are free to choose whatever path we like, but a portion of any acceptable path is fixed in the disc itself and turns with the disc. The flux is calculated though the entire path, return loop plus disc segment, [...] and its rate-of change found.|$|E

50|$|This sphere {{example was}} used by Newton himself to discuss the {{detection}} of rotation relative to absolute space. Checking the fictitious force needed {{to account for the}} tension in the string is one way for an observer {{to decide whether or not}} they are rotating - if the fictitious force is zero, they are not rotating. (Of course, <b>in</b> <b>an</b> extreme <b>case</b> <b>like</b> the gravitron amusement ride, you do not need much convincing that you are rotating, but standing on the Earth's surface, the matter is more subtle.)
