5|$|After the eulogies, {{the three}} {{speakers}} each laid a wreath at the casket, and the Senate Chaplain, the Reverend Barry Black, gave the benediction. Cheney escorted Nancy Reagan to the casket, where {{she said her}} goodbyes. The dignitaries in the room paid their respects during the next half-hour. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> instance, {{the doors of the}} Capitol were then opened to the public, who stood in lines stretching many blocks to view the casket.|$|E
5|$|Arad's {{police force}} {{was chosen as}} the {{exceptional}} force for 2007, and awarded an award of excellence on 5 March 2008. Among others, a severe reduction in property crime was cited. Arad's force was able {{to reduce the amount of}} such crimes from 1,092 in 2003 to just 168 in 2007. On 18 July 2008, Arad police, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> incident, shot dead a man threatening to kill his ex-wife with a knife.|$|E
5|$|Bell entered Penn in {{the fall}} of 1914 as an English major and joined Phi Kappa Sigma. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> {{occurrence}} for a sophomore, he became the starting quarterback for Penn's coach George H. Brooke. On the team, he also was as a defender, punter, and punt returner. After the team's 3–0 start, Bell temporarily shared possession of his quarterbacking duties until he subsequently reclaimed them later in the season, as Penn finished with a record of 3–5–2.|$|E

5|$|Cresswell was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> {{position}} for many reasons. Although she was of common birth, {{a woman and}} unmarried, she rose {{to a position of}} high status, running a large business enterprise. By mid-life she was an independently wealthy woman, connected across England to rich and powerful men in government and the court. Her network of services were in high demand, counter to the religious and social morals of the day.|$|E
5|$|In 1976 Giridhar {{topped the}} final Acharya {{examinations}} in Vyakarana, winning seven gold medals and the Chancellor's gold medal. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> achievement, {{although he had}} only enrolled for a master's degree in Vyakarana, he was declared Acharya of all subjects taught at the university on 30 April 1976.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, the Mets and the Phillies met <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> 5 game {{regular season}} series at Citizens Bank Park. The Mets took 4 out of 5 games.

The stela is executed in the wrap-around style. A flint blade was found buried under the stela butt, buried as an offering when the stela was dedicated. The hieroglyphic inscriptions on Stela H are badly damaged.|$|E
5|$|After the {{publication}} of Go Quietly, Agnew largely disappeared from public view. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> TV interview in 1980, he advised young people not to go into politics because too much was expected of those in high public office. In 1983 a Maryland court ordered him to pay the state the sum of $268,000, including interest and penalties, {{the sum of the}} bribes he had taken while a public employee. Agnew did not dispute the judgement, but seven years later applied unsuccessfully for this sum to be treated as tax-deductible. He was briefly in the news in 1987, when as the plaintiff in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, he gave the public some insight into his recent business activities.|$|E
5|$|Because it seldom {{appears in}} high concentration, {{germanium}} was discovered comparatively {{late in the}} history of chemistry. Germanium ranks near fiftieth in relative abundance of the elements in the Earth's crust. In 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev predicted its existence and some of its properties from its position on his periodic table, and called the element ekasilicon. Nearly two decades later, in 1886, Clemens Winkler found the new element along with silver and sulfur, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> mineral called argyrodite. Although the new element somewhat resembled arsenic and antimony in appearance, the combining ratios in compounds agreed with Mendeleev's predictions for a relative of silicon. Winkler named the element after his country, Germany. Today, germanium is mined primarily from sphalerite (the primary ore of zinc), though germanium is also recovered commercially from silver, lead, and copper ores.|$|E

5|$|During the series, Barnett {{made two}} notable errors. With Australia leading the series 10 {{going into the}} Fifth Test at The Oval, Barnett dropped Len Hutton and Maurice Leyland when both were on 40. Leyland went on to post 187 while Hutton set a Test world record of 364. In effect, England were gifted an extra 461runs as they set a world record score of 7/903. Bradman injured himself during the {{marathon}} innings <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> stint at the bowling crease after the specialist bowlers had failed to break the Englishmen. With opener Jack Fingleton also injured, Australia were down to nine men {{and fell to the}} heaviest defeat in Test history (an innings and 579 runs) and the series was drawn.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> {{example of}} the {{political}} protest for which Trafalgar Square is famous occurring in the National Gallery, the Rokeby Venus was damaged on 10 March 1914 by Mary Richardson, a campaigner for women's suffrage, in protest against the arrest of Emmeline Pankhurst the previous day. Later that month another suffragette attacked five Bellinis, causing the Gallery to close until {{the start of the}} First World War, when the Women's Social and Political Union {{called for an end to}} violent acts drawing attention to their plight.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> occurrence, the Sounds and the Indianapolis Indians {{exchanged}} no-hitters on back-to-back nights (August 6 and August 7, 1988). First, Indianapolis' Randy Johnson and Pat Pacillo {{combined for}} a no-hit loss against the Sounds, a 1–0 Nashville win. Nashville won when Lenny Harris walked to first base, stole second base and third base, {{and then came}} home, scoring on a groundout. The next night, Nashville's Jack Armstrong registered a no-hit game against the Indians, a 4–0 Sounds victory. This {{was the first time}} in American Association history that teams played in back-to-back no-hit games.|$|E

5|$|Secretariat won the Eclipse Award for American Champion Two-Year-Old Male Horse and, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> occurrence, two two-year-olds {{topped the}} balloting for 1972 American Horse of the Year honors, with Secretariat edging out the undefeated filly, La Prevoyante. Secretariat {{received}} {{the votes of}} the Thoroughbred Racing Associations of North America and the Daily Racing Form, while La Prevoyante was chosen by the National Turf Writers Association. Only one horse since then, Favorite Trick in 1997, has won that award as a two-year-old.|$|E
5|$|The Puerto Rican {{delegation}} was freely {{elected by}} those eligible to vote (male Caucasian property owners), <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> exercise of political openness in the colony. Segundo Ruiz Belvis {{was elected to}} the Junta representing Mayagüez, something that horrified the then governor general of the island. To the frustration of the Puerto Rican delegates, including its leader, José Julián Acosta, the Junta had a majority of Spanish-born delegates, which would vote down almost every measure they suggested. However, Acosta could convince the Junta that abolition could be achieved in Puerto Rico without disrupting the local economy (including its Cuban members, who frowned upon implementing it in Cuba because of its much higher numbers of slave labor). Once he became prime minister in 1870, Castelar did approve an abolition bill, praising the efforts of the Puerto Rico members, sincerely moved by Acosta's arguments.|$|E
5|$|The Whiskers' new {{neighbours}} {{were the}} Zappa and the Starsky. Although {{smaller than the}} Whiskers, the Zappa attacked frequently, and when they fled after one attack, the Whiskers – <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> occurrence – adopted an abandoned Zappa pup. The Starsky group, on the other hand, was no threat to the Whiskers. Formed by a trio of Flower's daughters permanently evicted from the Whiskers, the small group was ravaged by illness, predators, {{and a lack of}} new pups. The constantly struggling Starsky succumbed in the penultimate episode, with the death of the last survivor, Mozart, who was killed by a jackal. Former Whiskers female Maybelline broke away from the group {{at the end of the}} third series, forming a new group called the Aztecs which became the Whiskers' rivals in the fourth series.|$|E

5|$|The {{cattle egret}} feeds {{on a wide}} range of prey, {{particularly}} insects, especially grasshoppers, crickets, flies (adults and maggots), and moths, as well as spiders, frogs, and earthworms. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> instance they have been observed foraging along the branches of a banyan tree for ripe figs. The species is usually found with cattle and other large grazing and browsing animals, and catches small creatures disturbed by the mammals. Studies have shown that cattle egret foraging success is much higher when foraging near a large animal than when feeding singly. When foraging with cattle, it has been shown to be 3.6times more successful in capturing prey than when foraging alone. Its performance is similar when it follows farm machinery, but it is forced to move more. In urban situations cattle egrets have also been observed foraging in peculiar situations like railway lines.|$|E
5|$|Como {{was born}} in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. He was the seventh of ten {{children}} and the first American-born child of Pietro Como and Lucia Travaglini, who both emigrated to the US in 1910 from the Abruzzese town of Palena, Italy. He did not begin speaking English until he entered school, since the Comos spoke Italian at home. The family had a second-hand organ his father had bought for $3; as soon as Como was able to toddle, he would head to the instrument, pump the bellows, and play music he had heard by ear. Pietro, a mill hand and an amateur baritone, had all his children attend music lessons {{even if he could}} barely afford them. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> 1957 interview, Como's mother, Lucia, described how her young son also took on other jobs to pay for more music lessons; Como learned to play many different instruments, but never had a voice lesson. He showed more musical talent in his teenage years as a trombone player in the town's brass band, playing guitar, singing at weddings, and as an organist at church. Como {{was a member of the}} Canonsburg Italian Band along with the father of singer Bobby Vinton, bandleader Stan Vinton, who was often a customer at his barber shop.|$|E
5|$|Hicks, who was {{generally}} {{described as the}} most effective of the Manchester City forwards, had a chance which he hit high over the crossbar. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> spell of sustained Manchester City pressure, a free kick by captain Jimmy McMullan forced a save from Pym, and the resulting near-post corner prompted a goalmouth scramble which ended with a foul on Bolton's Greenhalgh. Pym made further saves from Browell and Hicks, the latter resulting in a corner. From the corner Bolton won the ball and headed upfield on the counter-attack. Billy Butler's cross from the right went beyond the goal and was retrieved by Vizard on the left wing. The outside-forward then cut inside and played the ball across goal in a manner described by some correspondents as a shot and others as a pass. David Jack received {{the ball in the}} six-yard box and put the ball between Goodchild and McCloy into the City goal, giving Bolton the lead with 14 minutes remaining. In the few minutes after the goal, Manchester City came forward in numbers but lacked clear chances and were hindered by over-eager forwards going offside. Following a goal kick by Pym, the referee blew the final whistle. Bolton won the cup for a second time, becoming the first club to win twice at Wembley.|$|E
