40|$|The {{primary goal}} of this newly {{installed}} beam profile measurement is to provide the facility operators and physicists with a reliable horizontal and vertical projected beam distribution and location {{with respect to the}} proton beam target and beam aperture. During a 3000 -hour annual run cycle, 5 μC of charge is delivered every 50 milliseconds through this harp to the downstream TRMS Mark III target. The resulting radioactive annual dose near this harp is at least 6 MGy. Because of this harsh environment, the new harp design has been further optimized for robustness. For example, compared to an earlier design, this harp has half of the sensing wires and utilizes only a single bias plane. The sensing fibers are 0. 079 -mm diameter SiC fibers. To hold these fibers to a rigid ceramic structure, a collet fiber-clamping device accomplishes the three goals of maintaining a mechanical <b>fiber</b> <b>clamp,</b> holding the sense fibers under a slight tensile force, and providing a sense-fiber electrical connection.

40|$|ABSTRACT Asymmetric {{membrane}} {{currents and}} fluxes of Ca 2 + release were determined in skeletal muscle <b>fibers</b> voltage <b>clamped</b> in a Vaseline-gap chamber. The conditioning pulse protocol 1 for suppressing Ca z+ release and the "hump" component of charge movement current (I~), {{described in the}} first paper of this series, was applied at different test pulse voltages. The amplitude of the current suppressed during the ON transient reached a maximum at slightly suprathreshold test voltages (- 50 to- 40 mV) and decayed at higher voltages. The component of charge movement current suppressed by 20 I~M tetracaine also went through a maximum at low pulse voltages. This anomalous voltage dependence is thus a property ofI,, defined by either the conditioning protocol or the tetracaine effect. A negative (inward-going) phase was often observed in the asymmetric current during the ON of depolarizing pulses. This inward phase was shown to be an intramembranous charge movement based on (a) its presence in the records of total membrane current, (b) its voltage dependence, with a maximum at slightly suprathreshold voltages, (c) its association with a "hump " in the asymmetric current, (d) it...|$|R

The activation-desensitization sequence was determined from carbachol- induced end-plate currents in potassium-depolarized <b>fibers</b> voltage- <b>clamped</b> either to - 40 mV or + 40 mV. The time-course of both desensitization onset and recovery developed exponentially, with onset occurring more rapidly than recovery. Desensitization onset was voltage dependent, the onset time constant being 8. 3 +/- 1. 3 s (11 fibers) at - 40 mV and 19. 3 +/- 3. 4 s (15 fibers) at + 40 mV. Recovery from desensitization was also influenced by voltage. The extent of recovery after 2 min was 80. 4 +/- 6. 3 % in those fibers voltage-clamped to - 40 mV and 57. 4 +/- 3. 6 % in those fibers voltage-clamped to + 40 mV. The voltage dependence of desenistization onset and recovery did not result from a difference in ability to control voltage at these two levels of membrane potential.

After 4 days of culture, an increase of the Na(V) 1. 5 channel type was observed. This was confirmed {{by an increase in}} TTX-resistant channels and by Western blot test. These channels exhibited increased activation time constant (tau(m)) and reduced conductance, similar to what has been observed in denervated muscles in vivo, where the density of Na(V) 1. 5 was increasing progressively after denervation. By real-time polymerase chain reaction, we found that the expression of beta subunits was also modified, but only after 7 days of culture: increase in beta(1) without beta(4) modifications. beta(1) subunit is known to induce a negative shift of the inactivation curve, thus reducing current amplitude and duration. At day 7, tau(h) was back to normal and tau(m) still increased, in agreement with a decrease in sodium current and conductance at day 4 and normalization at day 7.

The rate of release of calcium from the SR (Rrel) was calculated from the calcium transients using the removal model of Melzer, W., E. Rios, and M. F. Schneider (1987. Biophys. J. 51 : 849 – 863.). IQ and delta [Ca 2 +] were calculated for 100 ms depolarizing test pulses to membrane potentials from - 30 to + 20 mV. To eliminate an inactivating component of Rrel, each test pulse was preceded by a large, fixed prepulse to + 20 mV. The resulting Rrel records, which represent the noninactivating component of Rrel, were compared with integral of IQdt. (Q), the total charge that moves. The voltage dependence of the steady state Rrel was steeper then that of Q and shifted to the right. During depolarization, the Rrel waveform {{was similar to that}} of Q but was delayed by several ms, while, during repolarization, Rrel preceded Q.

The low noise figure can be achieved because the lasing power copropagates with the signals, and it is exported separately from the amplified signal thanks to interleaver. Mean-while, the fiber Bragg grating incorporated in DP configuration suppresses the backward amplified spontaneous emission gener-ation, and therefore improves efficiently the gain and lowers the noise figure.

40|$|Frog {{skeletal}} muscle has a K+ channel called the inward rectifier, which passes inward current {{more readily than}} outward current. Gay and Stanfield (1977) described a voltage-dependent block of inward K+ currents through the inward rectifier by external Cs+ in frog muscle.

These findings are not consistent with a one-ion channel model for the inward rectifier. The Eyring rate theory formalism for channels, viewed as single-file multi-ion pores (Hille and Schwarz, 1978), was used to develop a two-site multi-ion model for the inward rectifier.

When the nominal free [Ca 2 +]i was 10 nM, {{the shape of the}} broad Iγ hump in the ON segments of charge movement traces remained invariant when the calcium release rate was greatly diminished. When the nominal free [Ca 2 +]i was 50 nM, which was close to the physiological level, the Iγ humps were accelerated and a slow calcium-dependent Iδ component (or state) was generated. The peak of ON Iδ synchronized perfectly with the peak of the calcium release rate whereas the slow decay of ON Iδ followed the same time course as the decay of calcium release rate. Suppression of calcium release by TMB- 8 reduced the amount of Qδ concomitantly but not completely, and the effects were partially reversible. The same simultaneous suppression effects were achieved by depleting the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium store with repetitive stimulation.

40|$|Asymmetric {{membrane}} {{currents and}} fluxes of Ca 2 + release were determined in skeletal muscle <b>fibers</b> voltage <b>clamped</b> in a Vaseline-gap chamber. The conditioning pulse protocol 1 for suppressing Ca 2 + release and the "hump" component of charge movement current (I gamma), {{described in the}} first paper of this series, was applied at different test pulse voltages. The amplitude of the current suppressed during the ON transient reached a maximum at slightly suprathreshold test voltages (- 50 to - 40 mV) and decayed at higher voltages. The component of charge movement current suppressed by 20 microM tetracaine also went through a maximum at low pulse voltages. This anomalous voltage dependence is thus a property of I gamma, defined by either the conditioning protocol or the tetracaine effect. A negative (inward-going) phase was often observed in the asymmetric current during the ON of depolarizing pulses. This inward phase was shown to be an intramembranous charge movement based on (a) its presence in the records of total membrane current, (b) its voltage dependence, with a maximum at slightly suprathreshold voltages, (c) its association with a "hump" in the asymmetric current, (d) its inhibition by interventions that reduce the "hump", (e) equality of ON and OFF areas in the records of asymmetric current presenting this inward phase, and (f) its kinetic relationship with the time derivative of Ca release flux. The nonmonotonic voltage dependence of the amplitude of the hump {{and the possibility of}} an inward phase of intramembranous charge movement are used as the main criteria in the quantitative testing of a specific model. According to this model, released Ca 2 + binds to negatively charged sites on the myoplasmic face of the voltage sensor and increases the local transmembrane potential, thus driving additional charge movement (the hump). This model successfully predicts the anomalous voltage dependence and all the kinetic properties of I gamma described in the previous papers. It also accounts for the inward phase in total asymmetric current and in the current suppressed by protocol 1. According to this model, I gamma accompanies activating transitions at the same set of voltage sensors as I beta. Therefore it should open additional release channels, which in turn should cause more I gamma, providing a positive feedback mechanism in the regulation of calcium release...|$|R

An inward phase of asymmetric currents following the hump component was observed in all fibers during the depolarization pulse to selected voltages (congruent to - 45 mV). The average value of the peak inward current was 0. 1 A/F (SEM = 0. 01, n = 18), and the time at which it occurred was 34 ms (SEM = 1. 8, n = 18). A second delayed outward phase of asymmetric current was observed after the inward phase, in those experiments in which hump component and inward phase were large. It peaked at more variable time (between 60 and 130 ms) with amplitude 0. 02 A/F (SEM = 0. 003, n = 11). The transmembrane voltage during a pulse, measured with a glass microelectrode, reached its steady value in less than 10 ms and showed no oscillations. The potential was steady at the time when the delayed component of asymmetric current occurred. ON and OFF charge transfers were equal for all pulse durations. The inward phase moved 1. 4 nC/microF charge (SEM = 0. 8, n = 6), or about one third of the final value of charge mobilized by these small pulses, and the second outward phase moved 0. 7 nC/microF (SEM = 0. 8, n = 6), bringing back about half of the charge moved during the inward phase. When repolarization intersected the peak of the inward phase, the OFF charge transfer was independent of the repolarization voltage in the range - 60 to - 90 mV. When both pre- and post-pulse voltages were changed between - 120 mV and - 60 mV, the equality of ON and OFF transfers of charge persisted, although they changed from 113 to 81 % of their value at - 90 mV. The three delayed phases in asymmetric current were also observed in experiments in which the extracellular solution contained Cd 2 +, La 3 + and no Ca 2 +. Large increases in intracellular [Cl-] were imposed, and had no major effect on the delayed components of the asymmetric current. The Ca 2 + transients measured optically and the calculated Ca 2 + release fluxes had three phases whenever a visible outward phase followed the inward phase in the asymmetric current. Several interventions intended to interfere with Ca release, reduced or eliminated the three delayed phases of the asymmetric current. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|R

Using voltage <b>clamped</b> <b>fibers,</b> we found that Ca 2 + release was suppressed at all test membrane potentials in S 100 A 1 −/− fibers. Here we examine the role of S 100 A 1 during physiological AP-induced muscle activity, using an integrative approach spanning AP propagation to muscle force production. With the voltage-sensitive indicator di- 8 -aminonaphthylethenylpyridinium, we first demonstrate that the AP waveform is not altered in flexor digitorum brevis muscle fibers isolated from S 100 A 1 KO mice. We then use a model for myoplasmic Ca 2 + binding and transport processes to calculate sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + release flux initiated by APs and demonstrate decreased release flux and greater inactivation of flux in KO fibers. Using in vivo stimulation of tibialis anterior muscles in anesthetized mice, we show that the maximal isometric force response to twitch and tetanic stimulation is decreased in S 100 A 1 −/− muscles. KO muscles also fatigue more rapidly upon repetitive stimulation than those of wild-type counterparts. We additionally show that fiber diameter, type, and expression of key excitation-contraction coupling proteins are unchanged in S 100 A 1 KO muscle.

The nerve model described by the equations obtained from the quantitative analysis shows many similarities with the squid fiber model, but there are also striking differences between the two nerves. Here will follow a short summary of the major voltage clamp findings on the nodal membrane obtained in my laboratory (see References). Then attention will be drawn to some points which deviate from the present quantitative description. Step changes in the membrane potential are associated with changes in membrane permeability to sodium and potassium ions. Both the sodium and the potassium permeability changes are smooth continuous functions of membrane potential and time. Changes in sodium and potassium currents are consequences of the permeability changes. These currents behave like passive ionic currents, i. e. they depend on potential and concentration as ions moving by diffusion in an electric field; the constant field equation describes satisfactorily the voltage and concentration dependence of these currents. The potential and time dependence of the permeability changes has been described quantitatively in terms of variables m, h, n, and p and rate constants (a's and P's) which depend on potential but not on time. The equations, obtained from the analysis of the voltage clamp experiments, describe the currents at step changes in membrane potential. These equations were then solved for the situation that the membrane currents can change the membrane potential. Such solutions show that the equations predict an action potential of nearly the same shape and amplitude as the action potential which is recorded from a single nerve fiber from Aenopus laevis. The equations also predict satisfactorily many other properties of the nerve fiber. Threshold, strength duration curve, subthreshold responses, and even slo...|$|R
