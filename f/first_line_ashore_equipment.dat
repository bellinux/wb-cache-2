50|$|Due to the {{extremely}} difficult surf {{caused by the}} gale raging in the Atlantic and the bitterness of the winter weather loss of life was heavy on both Pollux and Truxtun. Heroic efforts to swim <b>lines</b> <b>ashore</b> failed due to the inability to handle them when they became oil soaked. Some of the crew attempted to swim ashore, many unsuccessfully. Finally lines with a boatswain's chair were rigged to a ledge and the remaining personnel were conveyed ashore. Truxtun broke up almost immediately after grounding and soon thereafter Pollux did likewise. The survivors owed their rescue in large measure to the tireless, efficient {{and in many cases}} heroic action of the people of Lawn and St. Lawrence, Newfoundland.|$|R

An unsuccessful {{attempt was made to}} get a <b>line</b> <b>ashore.</b> The Captain ordered all to the four life boats, the intent being to wait until light and then make for the beach. The boats were attached by lines astern but three soon capsized in the heavy sea. A rocket was sent up and a blue light burned to show the position of the beach. Most of those thrown from the capsizing lift boats were drowned having been overcome by the cold. Had they all remained on board they would most likely have all survived.|$|R

Four sailors volunteered in {{succession}} to carry a light <b>line</b> <b>ashore.</b> And each man, in turn, dead {{at the end of}} it, was hauled back on board. While they were untying the last one, Graham, with an arm like a leg, stripped for it and went to it. And he did it, although the pounding he got on the sand broke his bad arm and staved in three ribs. But he made the line fast before he quit. In order to haul the hawser ashore, six more volunteered to go in on Evan's line to the beach. Four of them arrived. And only one woman of the forty was lost--she died of heart disease and fright.|$|R
