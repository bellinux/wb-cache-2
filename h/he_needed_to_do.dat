5|$|After {{the project}} was accepted, Hinoue {{consulted}} Key's former main scenario writer Jun Maeda on various game scenario writers to employ for Rewrite. However, the one writer Hinoue wanted on {{the project was}} Romeo Tanaka, who {{she had become a}} fan of after she played FlyingShine's 2003 visual novel Cross Channel, written by Tanaka. While he did not initially accept the offer, Tanaka decided to take the project when he was given the time <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the job. When he accepted it, Tanaka was still unaware that Maeda had stepped down as Key's main scenario writer, and he became more interested when he was told that he would write Rewrites overall story.|$|E

But he found <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something more substantial than just be one doctor in one place of need. He initiated Project Concern to organize the work and it was incorporated in 1961. He first focused on Casa de Todos.|$|E
500|$|In an import preview, Kotaku's Richard Eisenbeis shared Famitsus {{praise of}} how the game was {{welcoming}} to players without experience of MMORPGs. An issue he pointed out with exploration and battle was that early sections required either a high level or a party for easy progression, but this eased up later into the game, in addition to enjoying the story and battle system. His main criticisms were the Chat systems, which were clumsy and difficult to use even with the right hardware peripheral, and the overly high amount of experience grinding <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> He finished the preview by calling Dragon Quest X [...] "surprisingly backwards in its execution despite its sometimes inspired ideas and low entry bar".|$|E

But we had to ask ourselves, does it help our story? No." [...] Footage that was nearly edited out included a scene where Anwar had to siphon petrol out of the family car for the house's generator. Anwar explained to the camera that <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it because their family was so poor.

An angry-looking Yemi replies, [...] "You speak to me as if I were your brother" [...] as he retreats into the jungle. Eko follows him asking [...] "Who are you?!", and then finds the smoke monster.

On April 5, 2014, Kane was a healthy scratch under new head coach Paul Maurice, {{in a game against}} the Toronto Maple Leafs. After the game, Maurice said it was a coach's decision, and that if Kane wanted back in the lineup, all <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was [...] "probably just come to the rink." [...] On February 3, 2015 Kane was a healthy scratch against the Vancouver Canucks. It was later determined that he was scratched because of an incident with his teammates. Kane revealed in an October 2015 interview that he felt the Jets did not [...] "have his back" [...] throughout his legal and behavioral issues but instead felt that they traded away their problem.

500|$|In {{contrast}} to the style of hanging-back defensive play common in the later 1950s and 1960s, Orr {{was known for his}} fluid skating and end-to-end rushing. Orr's rushing enabled him to be where the puck was, allowing him not only to score effectively but also to defend when necessary. According to the Bruins' Phil Esposito, [...] "No matter how fast an opponent was, Bobby could skate faster than him if <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it in the framework of a play. If he was caught up-ice and the other team had an odd-man rush, that's when you saw his truly great speed. Very seldom did he not get back to have a hand in breaking up the play." [...] Orr also benefited from playing most of his career in Boston Garden, which was [...] shorter than the standard NHL rink. This suited his rushing style very well, as he was able to get {{from one end of the}} ice to the other faster than in a standard rink.|$|E
500|$|In 1969, {{his first}} {{official}} {{year on the}} track, he won the All American Futurity and eight other stakes races. In winning the All American, he led from the start on a sloppy, muddy track.

All I {{had to do was}} just sit there and let him roll." [...] His time of 20.46seconds to cover [...] was remarkable considering that three days of rain {{before the start of the}} race had turned the track into a muddy quagmire. At another stakes, the Ribbon Futurity at Sallisaw, Oklahoma, Easy Jet won by three-quarters of a length and set a new track record of 16.92seconds for [...] The only time in 1969 he did not finish first, second, or third, he had issues in the starting gate, false-started, broke some teeth loose against the front of the gate, and was struggling to stand up again when the gates opened; he still managed to finish fifth out of ten horses.|$|E
500|$|The Mellotron {{became a}} key {{instrument}} in progressive rock. King Crimson bought two Mellotrons when forming in 1969. They {{were aware of}} Pinder's contributions to the Moody Blues and didn't want to sound similar, but concluded {{there was no other}} way of generating the orchestral sound. The instrument was originally played by Ian McDonald, and subsequently by Robert Fripp on McDonald's departure. Later member David Cross recalled he didn't particularly want to play the Mellotron, but felt that it was simply what <b>he</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> as a member of the band. Tony Banks bought a Mellotron from Fripp in 1971, which he claimed was previously used by King Crimson, to use with Genesis. He decided to approach the instrument in a different way to a typical orchestra, using block chords, and later stated that he used it in the same manner as a synth pad on later albums. His unaccompanied introduction to [...] "Watcher of the Skies" [...] on the album Foxtrot (1972), played on a Mk II with combined strings and brass, became significant enough that Streetly Electronics provided a [...] "Watcher Mix" [...] sound with the M4000. Banks claims to still have a Mellotron in storage, but doesn't feel inclined to use it as he generally prefers to use up-to-date technology. Barclay James Harvest's Woolly Wolstenholme bought an M300 primarily to use for string sounds, and continued to play the instrument live into the 2000s as part of a reformed band.|$|E

[...] However, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) gains Angela's approval to ask her out on a date by giving her the cat (named Garbage) that Dwight had tried to give Angela earlier, sending Dwight spiraling into crushing depression. Dwight retreats to the stairwell to moan. Jim joins him and recounts his days pining for Pam and how miserable it made him feel, saying he would not wish it on his worst enemy, Dwight included, to experience it, and Dwight realizes that he is not without friends. Having re-opened his old memories, Jim re-enters the office, goes right to Pam and kisses her passionately, and indirectly confesses {{in an interview that he}} loves her. Jim is quietly pleased when Dwight returns to his desk along with his annoying and overbearing personality. Jan learns of Michael's dismal finances by phone, and immediately harangues Michael about being irresponsible. [...] He panics and attempts to hop a nearby train. [...] However, the train is slowing down and comes to a complete halt, upon which he is seen sitting on the train singing to himself. Jan speeds to the office and Oscar tells her in which direction Michael ran. She then runs to the train yard. She tells him that she will stand by him as he did when she was fired. Eventually, they leave the train yard hand in hand.|$|E
