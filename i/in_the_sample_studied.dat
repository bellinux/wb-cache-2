5000|$|Cognitive ability {{tests are}} {{designed}} to measure different aspects of cognition. Specific domains assessed by tests include mathematical skill, verbal fluency, spatial visualization, and memory, among others. However, individuals who excel at one type of test tend to excel at other kinds of tests, too, while those who do poorly on one test tend to do so on all tests, regardless of the tests' contents. The English psychologist Charles Spearman {{was the first to}} describe this phenomenon. In a famous research paper published in 1904, he observed that children's performance measures across seemingly unrelated school subjects were positively correlated. This finding has since been replicated numerous times. The consistent finding of universally positive correlation matrices of mental test results (or the [...] "positive manifold"), despite large differences in tests' contents, has been described as [...] "arguably the most replicated result in all psychology." [...] Zero or negative correlations between tests suggest the presence of sampling error or restriction of the range of ability <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> <b>studied.</b>|$|E
