40|$|In this article, {{we present}} a point process method to assess dynamic baroreflex {{sensitivity}} (BRS) by estimating the baroreflex gain as focal component of a simplified closed-loop model of the cardiovascular system. Specifically, an inverse Gaussian probability distribution is used to model the heartbeat interval, whereas the instantaneous mean is identified by linear and bilinear bivariate regressions on both the previous R−R intervals (RR) and blood pressure (BP) beat-to-beat measures. The instantaneous baroreflex gain is estimated as the feedback branch of the loop with a point-process filter, while the RRBP feedforward transfer function representing heart contractility and vasculature effects is simultaneously estimated by a recursive least-squares filter. These two closed-loop gains provide a direct assessment of baroreflex control of heart rate (HR). In addition, the dynamic coherence, cross bispectrum, and their power ratio can also be estimated. All statistical indices provide a valuable quantitative assessment {{of the interaction between}} heartbeat dynamics and hemodynamics. To illustrate the application, we have applied the proposed point process model to experimental recordings from 11 healthy subjects in order to monitor cardiovascular regulation under propofol anesthesia. We present quantitative results during transient periods, as well as statistical analyses on steady-state epochs before and after propofol administration. Our findings validate the ability of the algorithm to provide a reliable and <b>fast-tracking</b> <b>assessment</b> of BRS, and show a clear overall reduction in baroreflex gain from the baseline period to the start of propofol anesthesia, confirming that instantaneous evaluation of arterial baroreflex control of HR may yield important implications in clinical practice, particularly during anesthesia and in postoperative care.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{is to develop a}} framework to maximize economic returns for large road infrastructure projects in developing countries. The literature has outlined many of the numerous challenges in roads projects in developing countries from corruption, poor quality work, and cost and time overruns. This is confirmed, to various degrees, by recent field experience in developing countries in the delivery of roads projects. Incentives of both the donor agency and the road agency have contributed to this underperformance, with a mix of insufficient accountability for results. Some authors question the economic efficiency of roads investments in developing countries by donor agencies, pointing to some evidence indicating that the ex post economic returns are not matching up to the ex-ante economic returns promised, to the extent an economic analysis was performed. The framework developed under this thesis attempts to align the incentives of the donor agency and road agency, while providing a higher degree of transparency and accountability into the investment decision making process, but also the engineering design and construction phase with a focus on the longer term sustainability of the road investment through increased adaption of modern pavement asset management techniques, graphical capabilities, engineering diagnosis, and statistical analysis. The first part of the framework is the development of a <b>fast-track</b> road network <b>assessment</b> tool in MS Excel, using the HDM- 4 approach to rapidly identify the most economically lucrative investments in a country to consider for further investment. This approach also allows the donor agency to validate the ability of the road agency to properly assess two prime elements of the pavement asset management system: the International Roughness Index (IRI) and Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT); this is an important confirmation of the road agencies’ ability to properly maintain the pavement asset post investment. The second part of this framework is the development of a graphic-based itinerary diagram approach to identify the cause(s) of deterioration and develop appropriate engineering solutions that minimize investment costs while maximizing economic returns. This framework is also built around the HDM- 4 model to show the primary engineering elements driving the economic assessment, which provide the needed justification of the economic models, but also serve as a project implementation monitoring and evaluation tool that can be used {{at the end of the}} project to determine the ex post economic analysis. The third and final part of the framework is the development of a Bayesian approach in coordination with the itinerary diagram approach to help road agencies determine the most probable cause(s) of deterioration on their road network. This will improve overall pavement design through empirical methods, but also improve the economic prioritization of the road network. The Bayesian method is meant to improve the accuracy of the pavement management system through adaptive learning. Through the identification of the cause of deterioration on similar road families, the pavement management system will be able to forecast the most likely cause(s) of deterioration on similar roads families, which allows the road agency the ability to intervene through a more timely and economically efficient manner through the reduction of vehicle and road agency costs. The {{objective of}} this part is to begin the development of the needed pavement design “know how” at the road agency to improve overall long-term sustainability of the road investments, which can improve long-term economic returns. The primary recommendations of the thesis are to continue the refinement of each of these three parts, which have already been field-tested to various degrees, to optimize each element for further use and deployment...|$|R

40|$|The {{state-of-the-art}} British-sponsored fasttrack {{assessment of}} the global impacts of climate change, a major input to the much-heralded Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change, indicates that through the year 2100, the contribution of climate change to human health and environmental threats will generally be overshadowed by factors not related to climate change. Hence, climate change {{is unlikely to be}} the world's most important environmental problem of the 21 st century. Analysis using both the Stern Review and the <b>fast-track</b> <b>assessment</b> reveals that notwithstanding climate change, for the foreseeable future, human and environmental well-being will be highest under the "richest-but-warmest" scenario and lower for the poorer (lower-carbon) scenarios. The developing world's future wellbeing should exceed present levels by several-fold under each scenario, even exceeding present wellbeing in today's developed world under all but the poorest scenario. Accordingly, equity-based arguments, which hold that present generations should divert scarce resources from today's urgent problems to solve potential problems of tomorrow's wealthier generations, are unpersuasive. Halting climate change would reduce cumulative mortality from various climate-sensitive threats, namely, hunger, malaria, and coastal flooding, by 4 - 10 percent in 2085, while increasing populations at risk from water stress and possibly worsening matters for biodiversity. But according to cost information from the UN Millennium Program and the IPCC, measures focused specifically on reducing vulnerability to these threats would reduce cumulative mortality from these risks by 50 - 75 percent {{at a fraction of the}} cost of reducing greenhouse gases (GHGs). Simultaneously, such measures would reduce major hurdles to the developing world's sustainable economic development, the lack of which is why it is most vulnerable to climate change. The world can best combat climate change and advance well-being, particularly of the world's most vulnerable populations, by reducing present-day vulnerabilities to climate-sensitive problems that could be exacerbated by climate change rather than through overly aggressive GHG reductions...|$|E
40|$|Agreements to {{mitigate}} climate change have been hampered by several things, not least their cost. But the cost {{might well be}} more acceptable {{if we had a}} clear picture of what damages would be avoided by different levels of emissions reductions, in other words, a clear idea of the pay off. The problem is that we do not. The Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published this year (IPCC (2001 a) and IPCC (2001 b)) lists a wide range of potential impacts but has difficulty in discriminating between those that are critical in their nature and magnitude from those that are less important. Yet, the identification of critical impacts (e. g. ones that should be avoided at any reasonable cost) is obviously a key to addressing targets for mitigating climate change. Indeed, a central objective of the UN Framework Objective on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is to avoid “dangerous levels” of climate change that could threaten food security, ecosystems and sustainable development (areas of risk that are specifically mentioned in UNFCCC Article 2). For several years, we have been researching impacts in key areas of risk: hunger, water shortage, exposure to malaria transmission, and coastal flooding, as part of a global <b>fast-track</b> <b>assessment</b> (Parry and Livermore, 1999). 1 The results of our work have been reported widely and form {{a significant part of the}} IPCC's assessment of likely impacts (IPCC (2001 a) and IPCC (2001 b)). But they are scattered through different parts of the IPCC report and other literature and, before now, we have not brought them together. For this review, we have graphed our estimates of effects as a single measure: the additional millions of people who could be placed at risk as a result of different amounts of global warming (Fig. 1). Full-size image (36 K) - Opens new window	Full-size image (36 K) Fig. 1. Additional millions at risk due to climate change in 2050 s and 2080 s for hunger, coastal flooding, water shortage and malaria. The width of the curve indicates one standard deviation of variance around the mean, based on results from four HadCM 2 experiments (Parry and Livermore, 1999; IPCC, 2000). Solid lines indicate model-based estimates. Dotted lines are inferred (IPCC (2001 a) and IPCC, 2001 b. Climate change 2001 : The Scientific Basis. Technical Summary of the Working Group I Report, Geneva, 2001. IPCC (2001 b)) and intended as schematic. Stab. 450 (etc.) =stabilisation@ 450 ppmv (etc.). View Within Article The figure shows the increase in millions at risk due to higher temperatures for two time periods— 2050 s and 2080 s. The analysis takes into account likely non-climate developments such as growth in population, and income and developments of technology, and these become important assumptions behind future trends in, for example, increases in crop yield and the building of coastal defences. These developments themselves have very great effects on the numbers at risk and represent a (non-climate change) reference case. The graph thus shows the additional millions at risk due specifically to estimated future changes in climate. But now for the caveats: the reference case is only for one future world (what the IPCC used to call a best estimate or “business-as-usual” future, now referred to as IS 92 a). More recently, the IPCC has explored a set of six different developmental pathways that the world may follow (IPCC, 2000), and the millions at risk in these alternative futures will certainly differ. Our work on these is in hand but will probably take a year to complete. We need also to emphasise that the graph is a global estimate which hides important regional variations and, so far, it is based on one model of future climate patterns (the UK's Hadley Centre second generation global climate model) (Johns et al., 1997). While these are the only global impact estimates currently available, we need urgently to complete similar ones for different climate models and for a variety of development pathways. Five important points emerge from this figure. First, the curves of additional millions at risk generally become steeper over time. Less obviously, this results as much from a larger and more vulnerable exposed population in 2080 than in 2050, as from increases in temperature or inferred changes in precipitation and sea-level rise. For example, the remarkable steepness of the water shortage curve in 2080 is the outcome of very large city populations in China and India becoming newly at risk. In the case of hunger, however, the rising curve in 2080 stems from widespread heat stress of crops, while up to about 2050 lesser amounts of warming lead to yield gains in temperate regions that balance losses elsewhere and lead to only small net increases in hunger (Parry and Livermore, 1999). These complex interactions between exposure and climate change tell a clear story: there will be more millions at risk as time progresses. Secondly, the figure indicates how much we need to reduce emissions in order to draw-down significantly the numbers at risk. We have estimated effects assuming that atmospheric concentrations of CO 2 are stabilised at 750 parts per million (ppmv) by 2250 and at 550 ppmv by 2150 (Arnell, in press). These are approximately equivalent, respectively, to 10 times and 20 times the reduction in emissions assumed in the Kyoto Protocol. The 750 ppmv target delays the damage but does not avoid it. By 2080, it would halve the number at risk from hunger and flooding, reduce the population at risk of malaria by perhaps a third and water shortage by about a quarter. But to bring risk levels down from hundreds to tens of millions would require a stabilisation target of about 550 ppmv. We have also indicated on the graph, but only in a schematic form, the approximate locations of 450, 650 and 1000 ppmv stabilisation pathways and their effect on millions at risk (IPCC (2001 a) and IPCC (2001 b)). Although impact analyses have not yet been conducted for these stabilisation levels, it appears that the 450 ppmv pathway would achieve very great reductions in millions at risk, although very high costs of mitigation would be incurred. It is precisely this kind of pay-off that needs to be analysed properly. A third conclusion is that information is now available that can help inform the selection of climate change targets. Thus far these targets, such as Kyoto, have been chosen in broadly a top–down manner, without clear knowledge of the impacts that would be avoided, and that has been partly their weakness. Now we may argue, for example, that in order to keep damages below an agreed tolerable level (for example, a given number of additional people at risk) global temperature increases would need to be kept below a given amount; and emissions targets could then be developed to achieve that objective. Fourthly, it is clear that mitigation alone will not solve the problem of climate change. Adaptation will be necessary to avoid, or at least reduce, much of the possible damage, and since we need many of the benefits of adaptation today, regardless of climate change in the future (e. g. increased drought protection of agriculture, improved flood defences, more efficient use of water, better malaria control), many of the adaptive strategies for climate change can be “win–win”. We need to find a blend of mitigation and adaptation to meet the challenge of climate change. Mitigation can buy time for adaptation (for example, delaying impacts until improved technology and management can handle them), and adaptation can raise thresholds of tolerance that need to be avoided by mitigation (for example, by increasing drought tolerance of crops). Considered separately, they appear inadequate to meet such a challenge, but combined they would make a powerful response...|$|E
