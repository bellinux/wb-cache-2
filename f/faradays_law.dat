The direction of the electromotive force is given by Lenzs law. An often overlooked fact is that <b>Faradays</b> <b>law</b> {{is based on the}} total derivative, not the partial derivative, of the magnetic flux. This means that an EMF may be generated even if total flux through the surface is constant. To overcome this issue, special techniques may be used.

40|$|The {{inversion}} {{of cause and}} effect in the classic description of electromagnetism, gives rise to a conceptual error which is at the bottom of many paradoxes and exceptions. At present, the curious fact that unipolar induction or the Faraday Disc constitutes an exception to the Faraday induction law is generally accepted. When we establish the correct cause and effect relationship a close connection appears between mechanics and electromagnetism, as does a new induction law for which paradoxes or exceptions do not occur. Some paradoxical experiments in unipolar induction involving the unique geometry of the spiral are described demonstrating the {{inversion of}} cause and effect. The emf and torque of the Faraday Disc and the conducting spiral is due to the continuous variation of the electromagnetic angular moment of the continuous current. This experiments confirm the Lorentz Force and invalidate <b>Faradays</b> Induction <b>Law.</b> They show how in a closed circuit emf and unipolar torque are not produced by the variation in magnetic flux, which is constant, but by two variations in the electromagnetic angular moment. The three possible ways of varying the electromagnetic angular moment generated by the circulation of the charges gives rise to the different forms of electromagnetic induction.

B also produces a deflection force on moving charged particles (as in TV tubes).

50|$|Both {{of these}} EMFs, despite their {{apparently}} distinct origins, are {{described by the}} same equation, namely, the EMF is {{the rate of change}} of magnetic flux through the wire. (This is <b>Faradays</b> <b>law</b> of induction, see below.) Einsteins special theory of relativity was partially motivated by the desire to better understand this link between the two effects. In fact, the electric and magnetic fields are different facets of the same electromagnetic field, and in moving from one inertial frame to another, the solenoidal vector field portion of the E-field can change {{in whole or in part}} to a B-field or vice versa.|$|E
50|$|See {{the diagram}} at right. It shows a metal sheet (C) {{moving to the}} right under a magnet. The {{magnetic}} field (B, green arrows) of the magnets north pole N passes down through the sheet. Since the metal is moving, the magnetic flux through sheet is changing. At {{the part of the}} sheet under {{the leading edge of the}} magnet (left side) the magnetic field through the sheet is increasing as it gets nearer the magnet. From <b>Faradays</b> <b>law</b> of induction, this field induces a counterclockwise flow of electric current (I, red), in the sheet. This is the eddy current. In contrast, at the trailing edge of the magnet (right side) the magnetic field through the sheet is decreasing, inducing a clockwise eddy current in the sheet.|$|E
5000|$|In {{inductive}} coupling (electromagnetic induction or inductive power transfer, IPT), power is transferred between coils of wire by a magnetic field. [...] The {{transmitter and receiver}} coils together form a transformer (see diagram). An alternating current (AC) through the transmitter coil (L1) creates an oscillating magnetic field (B) by Amperes law. The magnetic field passes through the receiving coil (L2), where it induces an alternating EMF (voltage) by <b>Faradays</b> <b>law</b> of induction, which creates an AC current in the receiver. [...] The induced alternating current may either drive the load directly, or be rectified to direct current (DC) by a rectifier in the receiver, which drives the load. A few systems, such as electric toothbrush charging stands, work at 50/60 Hz so AC mains current is applied directly to the transmitter coil, but in most systems an electronic oscillator generates a higher frequency AC current which drives the coil, because transmission efficiency improves with frequency.|$|E

In this paper we present a method to study the relationship between induced electromagnetic force (EMF) {{and the rate of}} change of Magnetic field and hence to verify this principle. This method involves the rotation of a magnet fixed to a rotor at different angular speeds and to find the EMF induced in the copper coil kept close to the rotor. The data collected is plotted in MATLAB. The results show that Induced EMF is directly proportional to the rate change of Magnetic flux with a correlation coefficient of 0. 98...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The dynamic {{behaviour}} {{of the northern}} polar cap area is studied employing Northern Hemisphere electric potential patterns derived by the Assimilative Mapping of Ionospheric Electrodynamics (AMIE) procedure. The rate of change in area of the polar cap, which {{can be defined as}} the region of magnetospheric field lines open to the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), has been calculated during two intervals when the IMF had an approximately constant southward component (1100 – 2200 UT, 20 March 1990 and 1300 – 2100 UT, 21 March 1990). The estimates of the polar cap area are based on the approximation of the polar cap boundary by the flow reversal boundary. The change in the polar cap area is then compared to the predicted expansion rate based on a simple application of <b>Faradayś</b> <b>Law.</b> Furthermore, timings of magnetospheric substorms are also related to changes in the polar cap area. Once the convection electric field reconfigures following a southward turning of the IMF, the growth rate of the observed polar cap boundary is consistent with that predicted by <b>Faradayś</b> <b>Law.</b> A delay of typically 20 min to 50 min is observed between a substorm expansion phase onset and a reduction in the polar cap area. Such a delay is consistent with a synthesis between the near Earth neutral line and current disruption models of magnetospheric substorms in which the dipolarisation in the magnetotail may act as a trigger for reconnection. These delays may represent a propagation time between near geosynchronous orbit dipolarisation and subsequent reconnection further down tail. We estimate, from these delays, that the neutral X line occurs between 35 R[subscript: E] and 75 R[subscript: E] downstream in the tail. 4551...|$|E
40|$|A {{theory for}} large {{amplitude}} compressional electromagnetic solitary pulses in a magnetized electron-positron (e-p) plasma is presented. The pulses, which propagate {{perpendicular to the}} external magnetic field, {{are associated with the}} compression of the plasma density and the wave magnetic field. Here the solitary wave magnetic field pressure provides the restoring force, while the inertia comes from the equal mass electrons and positrons. The solitary pulses are formed due to a balance between the compressional wave dispersion arising from the curl of the inertial forces in <b>Faradays</b> <b>law</b> and the nonlinearities associated with the divergence of the electron and positron fluxes, the nonlinear Lorentz forces, the advection of the e-p fluids, and the nonlinear plasma current densities. The compressional solitary pulses can exist in a well-defined speed range above the Alfven speed. They can be associated with localized electromagnetic field excitations in magnetized laboratory and space plasmas composed of electrons and positrons. ...|$|E

In this device plasma (Ionized gas) is the working fluid similar to the mechanism that happening in the magnetosphere of our earth’s atmosphere.

Most problems come from the low conductivity feature in the gas at high temperature.

40|$|Electrochemical Mechanical Polishing (ECMP) {{has become}} {{increasingly}} important due to the continuous decrease of the device size in integrated circuit (IC) fabrication. Tantalum (Ta) {{is a promising material}} as a substitute for copper in ICs. This dissertation studies the tribology and electrochemistry of Ta ECMP. The present research uses experimental combined analysis approaches. A specially designed experimental setup assembling a tribometer and a potentiostat was used to carry out Ta ECMP. The friction force and electrochemical reactions were measured simultaneously. Using this setup, we found the factors which affected the frictional behaviors of Ta during ECMP. The technique of single frequency electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed to investigate the material removal mechanisms in Ta ECMP. The results presented the competing mechanisms of removal and formation of a surface oxide layer of Ta. In order to further the investigation in a nanoscale, the atomic force microscope (AFM) was used to measure the material removal rate. The Preston equation for the Ta ECMP was established. A new methodology was developed to study the oxidation state and process of Ta during ECMP. Through comparing the material removal rate measured by using the AFM and the calculated one via the <b>Faraday?s</b> <b>law,</b> the distribution of the Ta suboxides and pentoxide, as well as the oxidation process, was revealed. The oxidation process was strongly dependent of the applied anodic potential, thickness of the oxide layer, mechanical forces, and surface orientation.

40|$|In {{many cases}} of {{exploration}} geophysics, isotropic Earth forward models have been developed and measured data can be interpreted by inversion using this class of model. An isotropic model treats the Earth as a simple structure, in which the relevant physical properties do not vary with direction, and {{the interpretation of the}} measured responses requires relatively less effort compared to interpretations based on anisotropic models. However, the actual Earth has anisotropic physical properties. Thus, a better understanding of anisotropic Earth responses using the MCSEM method is the main objective of this thesis. The controlled-source electromagnetic response in the frequency domain due to excitation by a horizontal electric dipole (HED) transmitter is herein evaluated over a layered seafloor consisting of a uniaxial anisotropic layer and an isotropic basement. Nominally, the upper uniaxial layer represents a thin-layered or interbedded earth formation caused by sedimentation over geologic time. Unlike an isotropic layer, a uniaxial layer is characterized by different values of electrical conductivity along two different directions. To solve the MCSEM forward problem for a uniaxial model with vertical anisotropy, it is required to combine <b>Faraday?s</b> <b>law</b> and Ampere?s law without displacement current, thereby forming the governing pre-Maxwell?s equations. The resulting diffusion equation in the spatial (x, y) domain is converted to horizontal wavenumber (p, q) domain using a 2 -D Fourier transform. The solution is analytic {{in the case of a}} uniaxial halfspace. The required source terms from an HED deployed in a conducting isotropic wholespace are derived from the Hertz vector potential and expressed, as usual in this type of problem, by Hankel transforms. Numerical modeling is required to evaluate MCSEM responses of more complicated Earth models, whether isotropic or anisotropic. Herein, the response of a resistive disk located below a vertical anisotropic layer is considered. This serves to investigate the effect of the anisotropic overburden on resolving the underlying disk. The response of the resistive disk placed beneath the anisotropic layer is finally evaluated using a finite element method implemented in the code SEATEM, which was previously developed by Badea et al.

40|$|Lithium ion {{batteries}} {{hold the}} potential to {{play a key role}} in meeting our future and increasing energy storage needs. Lithium ion batteries have the highest energy density of all battery systems currently available. Since their introduction to the modern battery market in the mid 90 ?s they have evolved and become the choice system for meeting energy needs in portable electronic devices. Lithium ion batteries, however, face many challenges preventing them from being utilized to their fullest potential. They suffer from self-discharge, degradation over repeated charging, not operating well at extreme low or high temperatures, and can suffer from the deposition of metallic lithium during charging. This deposition builds up on the surface of the graphite electrode and can lead to the formation of structures called dendrites. These dendrites can cause problems like internal short-circuits, ultimately resulting in the battery catching on fire. The focus of this work is to study the electrodeposition of lithium on graphite electrodes. Two main tools are used over the course of this study: modeling and experimentation. The first half of this work discusses the approach through computational modeling. A simple one dimensional, needle-like dendrite model is developed. Through analysis of the concentration gradient that occurs near the surface of the electrode and evaluation of the overpotentials that develop due to applied current at the surface of the electrode a relationship is found for the tip current density. Propagation of the dendrite is calculated from determination of the tip current density and application of <b>Faraday?s</b> <b>law.</b> Appropriate verification through the method of manufactured solutions and validation by comparison to previously reported experimental data are discussed. The second half of this work cover the experimental parts of this work to probe the electrodeposition of lithium on graphite electrodes. The development of the cell fabrication techniques and the characterization of the graphite electrode material used in these experiments is explained. The graphite used in these experiments was CMS graphite on a copper current collector with a specific capacity of 317 mAh/g. The experimental investigation of electrodeposited lithium on graphite electrodes is studied by the development and utilization of a novel dynamic impedance measurement technique. The impedance response of the cell is captured across different states of charge of normally charged cells and of cells where electrodeposition was proven to occur. Through trends in the impedance data, and through utilization of equivalent circuit analysis, correlations of changes in the impedance with the electrodeposition of lithium are made. In the absence of lithium electrodeposition, the general impedance response of the cell is to increase with increasing SOC. However, this trend reverses under conditions where electrodeposition is occurring. The presence of electrodeposited lithium is verified using SEM imaging...|$|E
