In sound reproduction, the meter, whether peak or not, is usually meant to correspond to the perceived loudness of a particular signal.|$|R
25|$|A peak-sensing {{compressor}} {{responds to}} the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>level</b> of the input signal. While providing tighter peak control, peak sensing might yield very quick changes in gain reduction, more evident compression or sometimes even distortion. Some compressors apply an averaging function (commonly root mean square or RMS) on the input signal before comparing its level to the threshold. This produces a more relaxed compression that more closely relates to human perception of loudness.|$|R

In the sense of this definition, it is almost always considered a fault condition. In layman's terms, the signal is going [...] "off the scale". Overmodulation results in spurious emissions by the modulated carrier, and distortion of the recovered modulating signal. This means that the envelope of the output waveform is distorted.|$|R

40|$|Based on {{numerical}} solutions of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation {{for either}} {{one or two}} active electrons, we propose a method for observing <b>instantaneous</b> <b>level</b> shifts in an oscillating strong infrared (IR) field in time, using a single tunable attosecond pulse to probe excited states of the perturbed atom. The ionization probability in the combined fields depends on both, {{the frequency of the}} attosecond pulse and the time delay between both pulses, since the IR field shifts excited energy levels into and out of resonance with the attosecond probe pulse. We show that this method (i) allows the detection of instantaneous atomic energy gaps with sub-laser-cycle time resolution and (ii) can be applied as an ultrafast gate for more complex processes such as non-sequential double-ionization...|$|R

Vertical vortices as well as corner vortices are responsible for accumulation of emissions emitted by vehicle traffic.

40|$|Renewable energy {{generation}} in the All-Island of Ireland (AII) {{is set to}} increase by 2020 due to binding renewable energy targets. To achieve these targets, there will be periods of time when 75 % of electricity will be generated mainly from onshore wind. Currently, the AII system can accommodate a 50 % maximum permissible <b>instantaneous</b> <b>level</b> of wind generation. The system operators must make system wide wind curtailment decisions to ensure this level is not breached. Subsequently, the ability to limit wind curtailment using large scale energy storage such as pumped hydroelectric energy storage and {{compressed air energy storage}} (CAES) is increasingly being scrutinized as a viable option. Thus, the aims of this paper are to estimate the level of wind curtailment on the 2020 AII system for various scenarios including with and without CAES; assess and quantify the revenue loss due to wind curtailment using power systems simulation software PLEXO...|$|R
40|$|Scattered {{light from}} {{orbiting}} or coorbiting dust {{is a primary}} signature by which Earth-based observers study the activity and atmosphere of the unusual outer solar system object 2060 Chiron. Therefore, {{it is important to}} understand the lifetime, dynamics, and loss rates of dust in its coma. We report here dynamical simulations of particles in Chiron's collisionless coma. The orbits of 17, 920 dust particles were numerically integrated under the gravitational influence of Chiron, the Sun, and solar radiation pressure. These simulations show that particles ejected from Chiron are more likely to follow suborbital trajectories, or to escape altogether, than to enter quasistable orbits. Significant orbital lifetimes can only be achieved for very specific launch conditions. These results call into question models of a long-term, bound coma generated by discrete outbursts, and instead suggest that Chiron's coma state is closely coupled to the nearly <b>instantaneous</b> <b>level</b> of Chiron's surface activity...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe used FM 1 - 43 {{imaging and}} {{intracellular}} recordings of synaptic potentials {{to measure the}} time course of endocytosis in frog motor nerve terminals following tetanic nerve stimulation, and we used fura- 2 imaging of intraterminal Ca 2 + concentration to compare endocytic rate and [Ca 2 +]i. Following a 30 Hz tetanus, endocytosis declined exponentially with a time constant that depended on the duration of stimulation. The level of [Ca 2 +]i rose from a resting value of about 100 nM to more than 500 nM during 30 Hz stimulation, and rapidly declined to 200 – 250 nM after stimulation. [Ca 2 +]i returned to resting level with a time course that, like endocytosis, depended on the duration of tetanic stimulation. However, the rate of [Ca 2 +]i recovery was much slower than the rate of endocytosis, leading to the conclusion that endocytic rate is not determined solely by the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>level</b> of [Ca 2 +]i...|$|R

Only those attenuation events which were unambiguously identified due to their origin were further carefully categorized according to the types of hydrometeors that occurred. Attenuation events were categorized into the following types according to their origin: rain (R), a mixture of rain with snow (RS), a mixture of rain with hail (RH), snow (S), fog only (F), a mixture of fog with rain (FR), a mixture of fog with snow (FS), and a mixture of fog with rain and snow (FRS).

5000|$|An {{example of}} this can be seen if one thinks of a {{hypothetical}} situation in which two individuals are engaging in conversation. If one individual sends a message to the other, the message receiver must then take that interaction and interpret what it means. Often, this can be done on an almost <b>instantaneous</b> <b>level</b> because the interpretation rules applied to the situation are immediate and simple. However, there are also times when one may have to search for an appropriate interpretation of the ‘rules’ within an interaction. This simply depends on each communicator’s previous beliefs and perceptions within a given context and how they can apply these rules to the current communicative interaction.Important to understand within the constructs of this theory is the fact that these [...] "rules" [...] of meaning [...] "are always chosen within a context". Furthermore, the context of a situation can be understood as a framework for interpreting specific events.|$|R
