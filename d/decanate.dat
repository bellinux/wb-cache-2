50|$|Each sign can {{be divided}} into three 10° sectors known as decans or decanates, though these have fallen into disuse. The first <b>decanate</b> is said to be most emphatically of its own nature and is ruled by the sign ruler. The next <b>decanate</b> is sub-ruled by the planet ruling the next sign in the same triplicity. The last <b>decanate</b> is sub-ruled by the next in order in the same triplicity.|$|E

40|$|The issue {{includes}} {{the territory of}} the <b>decanates</b> of Bytorn and Pszczyna in Upper Silesia and the <b>decanates</b> of Siewierz and Lelów in the region of Częstochowa and New Silesia. All these <b>decanates</b> used to belong to the Cracow diocese although most of them were beyond the borders of Poland. Until 1741 all Silesia was under the Austrian rule. It was only after the Silesian war between Prussia and Austria in 1741 that Silesia was subjected to the Prussian rule. Soon after the first partition, on January 4, 1773, the Prussian authorities demanded that the Cracow bishop Kajetan Sołtyk grant powers for the Bytom and Pszczyna <b>decanates.</b> Finally, territorial affiliation of these two <b>decanates</b> was decided in the years 1816 - 1821. Talks were held then between Nibuhr, plenipotentiary of the Prussian government and cardinal Consalvi, representative of the Holy See, concerning reorganization of church administration in Prussia. By the powers of the papal bulla De salutare animarum of July 16, 1821 the <b>decanates</b> of Bytom and Pszczyna were incorporated into the Wroclaw diocese...|$|R

He {{exercised}} an important influence over Durham University {{of which he}} was warden, and education in the north of England generally owed much to his efforts. The foundation of the College of Science at Newcastle in 1871 was very largely his work. He resigned the deanery, owing to failing health, in 1894, and went to live at Torquay. There he died suddenly on 8 December 1897.|$|E
50|$|Many {{research}} astrologers {{believe that}} the astrological ages {{can be divided into}} smaller sections along the lines of 'wheels within wheels'. The most common method is to divide each astrological ages into twelve sub-periods. There are two common ways of undertaking this process and two ways of applying these sub-periods. Furthermore, some astrologers divide the ages in different ways. For example, Lcdr David Williams employs a <b>decanate</b> sub-division whereby each age is divided into three equal sections. Robert Hand developed another approach entirely whereby the conjunction of the moving vernal point with specific stars within the zodiacal constellations provides an extra flavour to the corresponding historical events based {{on the nature of the}} star involved.|$|E

50|$|In modern times, {{however, the}} {{assignment}} of decans has changed considerably. Each sign is allocated a triplicity, such as air, water, earth or fire. Each sign is therefore subdivided into three equal parts of 10 degrees each, and these parts {{are referred to as}} decans, or <b>decanates.</b>|$|R
50|$|During the Early Middle Ages it was {{the home}} of a parish church that covered a large parish. This Church of St. Eusebius was {{probably}} built in the 6th or 7th century by the Bishop of Lausanne. The church is mentioned several times between 852-875. In the 9th century, the parish was split into several independent parishes. As the parish shrunk in size, the church gradually lost its former importance, but it remained the center of the <b>Decanate</b> of Ogo until the 16th century. The deanery covered the whole Saanen valley to Treyvaux, the Jaun and Sionge valleys and extended west to Glâne. Bulle probably came under the secular power of the Bishop of Lausanne as early as the 6th century, and together with Avenches and Curtilles formed the territory originally owned by the bishop.|$|E
5000|$|In many {{countries}} that have Roman Catholicism as the official or dominant religion, the apostolic nuncio holds the <b>decanate</b> and is the corps' spokesman on formal occasions; in other cases, the nuncio is treated as an ordinary ambassador of the Holy See and has no special precedence. The Congress of Vienna and the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations provided that any country may choose to give nuncios a different precedence than other ambassadors. The diplomatic corps may also cooperate amongst itself {{on a number of}} matters, including certain dealings with the host government. In practical terms, the Dean of the Diplomatic Corps may {{have a role to play}} in negotiating with local authorities regarding the application of aspects of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and diplomatic immunity, such as the payment of certain fees or taxes, since the receiving country is required [...] "not to discriminate between states". In this sense, the dean has the role of representing the entire diplomatic corps for matters that affect the corps as a whole, although this function is rarely formalized.|$|E
50|$|The {{particular}} {{location of}} planets in the Varga charts materially influences {{the results of}} planets constituting a yoga. The two sets of vargas that are commonly used are - a) the Shadvarga i.e. the six-fold division of sign namely, the Rasi or sign, the Hora, the Drekkena or <b>decanate,</b> the Navamsa, the Dwadasamsa and the Trimsamsa, and b) the Saptavarga i.e. the seven-fold division, by tagging the Saptamsa to the Shadvargas. Some follow the Dasavargas or the ten-fold division, and in his Bṛhat Parāśara Horāśāstra, Parasara speaks about the Shodasvarga or the sixteen-fold division of a rasi. Planets {{become more and more}} auspicious by gaining more and more of their own, exalted or friendly vargas. Accordingly, the status thus acquired by planets stands graded for easy identification etc. When a planet acquires two out of sixteen such own or exalted vargas or divisions then it is known to have gained the status called the Parijatamsa or Bhedakamsa, when three vargas are gained then the Uttamamsa or Kusumamsa or Vyanjanamsa, four - the Gopuramsa or Naagpushpamsa or Kimshukamsa or Chaamaramsa, five - the Simhasanamsa or Kundakamsa or Chhatramsa, six - the Parvatamsa or Keralamsa or Kundalamsa, seven - the Devalokamsa or Kalpavrkshamsa or Mukatamsa, eight - the Kumkumamsa or Brahmalokamsa or Chandanvanamsa, nine - the Iravatamsa or Poornachandramsa, ten - the Vyshnavamsa or Shridham or Ucchaishrvamsa, eleven - the Saivamsa Dhanvantriamsa, twelve - the Bhaswadamsa or Suryakantamsa, thirteen - the Vaisheshikamsa or Vidrumamsa, fourteen - the Indrasanamsa, fifteen - the Golokamsa, and sixteen - the Shrivallabhamsa (Bṛhat Parāśara Horāśāstra Slokas 42-51) (Sarvartha Chintamani St.32-35).|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} selected {{issues relating}} to Uniejów archdeaconry in the Old Polish period. The town of Uniejów was the central place – a seat of the archdeaconry, <b>decanate</b> and, most importantly, the collegiate chapter comprising 4 prelacies and 6 canonries, and the requisite number of curacies. The vice-provost was also the village vicar, and the vice- archdeacon was the town vicar. The collegiate church ran a school and fraternities. In the town there also were: church and hospital of Holy Spirit, Oratories of St. Nicolaus, Corpus Christi, St. Adalbert, and St. Anthony the Abbot. The nearby town of Sieradz with its chapter also {{was one of the}} main archdeaconry centers. The Uniejów archdeaconry 77 was a part of Gniezno archdiocese, and most probably was formed as a result of administrative reforms carried out by archbishop Jakub Świnka. In our times it was devided into four, next five and finally into six decanates comprising between 86 and 106 parishes. The Uniejów chapter was reactivated in 1990...|$|E
40|$|The Archdiocese Eucharistic Congress {{took place}} in the archdiocese of Vilnius in 1931. Due to a large area of the archdiocese, it took place not only in the bishopric of Vilnius, but also in {{fourteen}} other places, primarily <b>decanate</b> parishes. Many lay Catholics were involved in both the preparations for the Congress and the Congress itself. Their involvement later became a good foundation for creating new structures of the Catholic Action, the so-called four columns of it: Catholic associations of young men, and young women, and of adult men and adult women. The proceedings of the Congress were similar in all the places, as it had been carefully planned and prepared beforehand. The most important elements of the Congress were the plenary meetings and meetings of particular sections, during which the participants were given a chance to listen to numerous lectures regarding Eucharistic issues and the relevance of Eucharist for daily life, including the social aspect of it. The climax of each Congress was a festive Eucharist celebrated usually by archbishop Jalbrzykowski with many priests and faithful. A Eucharistic procession concluding the Eucharist would become a way of manifesting the faith and expressing the affiliation with the Church. AWSD w Białymstoku 145 - 16...|$|E
