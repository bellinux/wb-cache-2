5|$|For a few limited {{purposes}} when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed,</b> {{pure iron}} {{is produced in}} the laboratory in small quantities by reducing the pure oxide or hydroxide with hydrogen, or forming iron pentacarbonyl and heating it to 250°C so that it decomposes to form pure iron powder. Another method is electrolysis of ferrous chloride onto an iron cathode.|$|E
5|$|ECTunes is {{developing}} a system that utilizes directional sound equipment to emit noise when and where <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed.</b> According to the company, its technology sends audible signals only {{in the direction of}} travel, thus allowing the vehicle to be heard by those who may be in the car's path, without disturbing others with unwelcome noise. Insero Horsens, a Danish venture company, has provided a significant investment to help ECTunes fully develop its technology.|$|E
5|$|Once the arc is struck, the welder {{moves the}} torch {{in a small}} circle to create a welding pool, the size of which depends {{on the size of}} the {{electrode}} and the amount of current. While maintaining a constant separation between the electrode and the workpiece, the operator then moves the torch back slightly and tilts it backward about 10–15 degrees from vertical. Filler metal is added manually to the front end of the weld pool as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{location}} {{brings in}} the need to rely upon native flora and fauna to survive. This is manifested in a stamina gauge, which constantly depletes during gameplay. Failure to restore the gauge by eating has detrimental effects on gameplay, such as decreasing Snake's ability to aim his weapon and being heard by the enemy due to Snake's loud stomach grumbles. Food {{can be stored in}} the backpack until <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed.</b> However, some types of food rot over time, and consuming rotten foods may result in Snake developing a stomach ache, causing the stamina gauge to deplete faster.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{support the}} safety of antivenom, with around a 5% chance of an acute reaction, 1–2% of {{anaphylaxis}} and 10% chance of a delayed reaction due to serum sickness. Nevertheless, {{it is recommended that}} an injection of adrenaline be ready and available in case <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> to treat a severe anaphylactic reaction, and also that the antivenom from the vial be administered diluted in a 100 ml bag of intravenous solution for infusion over 30 minutes. While it is rare that patients report symptoms of envenomation lasting weeks or months following a bite, there are case reports from the 1990s in which antivenom was reported to be effective in the relief of chronic symptoms when administered weeks or months after a bite, however, {{in the vast majority of}} cases, it is administered within 24 hours.|$|E
5|$|The stadium was {{designed}} to be capable of supporting future seating expansion to 80,000. The 30,000 seats would be added above the second deck of the stadium {{from the end of the}} press boxes across to the northwest end of the venue, wrapping around the remainder of the horseshoe. The auxiliary video display currently adjacent to the easternmost section of the media areas would likely be relocated to atop the new third deck. The University of Minnesota could add all 30,000 seats in a single addition or in increments of 10,000 seats, meeting demand as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> (although the duplicated costs of such a plan make it unlikely). If expansion is ever undertaken, it can be completed in about 9 months so that there would be minimal interruption of a football season.|$|E

5|$|Hemoglobin is {{an oxygen}} carrier {{that occurs in}} red blood cells and {{contributes}} their color, transporting oxygen in the arteries from the lungs to the muscles where it is transferred to myoglobin, which stores it until <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> for the metabolic oxidation of glucose, which generates energy. Here the hemoglobin binds to carbon dioxide, produced when glucose is oxidized, which is transported through the veins by hemoglobin (predominantly as bicarbonate anions) back to the lungs where it is exhaled. In hemoglobin, the iron is in one of four heme groups and has six possible coordination sites; four are occupied by nitrogen atoms in a porphyrin ring, the fifth by an imidazole nitrogen in a histidine residue {{of one of the}} protein chains attached to the heme group, and the sixth is reserved for the oxygen molecule it can reversibly bind to. When hemoglobin is not attached to oxygen (and is then called deoxyhemoglobin), the Fe2+ ion {{at the center of the}} heme group (in the hydrophobic protein interior) is in a high-spin configuration. It is thus too large to fit inside the porphyrin ring, which bends instead into a dome with the Fe2+ ion about 55picometers above it. In this configuration, the sixth coordination site reserved for the oxygen is blocked by another histidine residue.|$|E

25|$|The {{only way}} California can support its {{extensive}} population and agriculture is to store water in numerous reservoirs and use pipes, tunnels, pumps and canals to distribute it where <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed.</b> Beginning before 1900, California has built extensive water projects costing many {{billions of dollars}} to store and move water where <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed.</b> California water comes primarily from snowfall in the Sierra Nevada {{in the northern part of}} the state during the relatively short winter from about October to March. The rest of the year typically has very little rainfall or snowfall. California weather is also prone to extended droughts that can last several years. During an average rainfall year, about 14% of the power used in California is generated by hydroelectricity.|$|E
