The process is usually used to produce accurate threads or threads in hard materials; a common application is ball screw mechanisms. There are three types: center-type grinding with axial feed, center-type infeed thread grinding and centerless thread grinding. Center-type grinding with an axial feed is the most common of the three. It is similar to cutting a thread on a lathe with a single-point cutting tool, except the cutting tool is replaced with a grinding wheel. Usually a single ribbed wheel is used, although multiple ribbed wheels are also available. To complete the thread multiple passes are commonly required. Center-type infeed thread grinding use a grinding wheel with multiple ribs that is longer than the length of the desired thread. First, the grinding wheel is fed into the blank to the <b>full</b> <b>thread</b> depth. Then the blank is slowly rotated through approximately 1.5 turns while axially advancing through one pitch per revolution. Finally, the centerless thread grinding process is used to make head-less set screws in a similar method as centerless grinding.

Most importantly, the FTT method can increase the spatial and temporal resolutions beyond the limits imposed by the available hardware compared with the conventional uniform mesh. At the simulation time of 0. 03 s in this study, the computer memory used for computation is no more than 10 MB with the FTT method, while it is about 50 MB with the uniform mesh method. In addition, the proposed FTT method is more efficient in computation time when compared with the uniform mesh method.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study the {{behaviour}} of bolted steel connections subjected to tension. Quasi-static conditions have been considered. By performing laboratory tests on single bolts and simple T-stub connections the failure modes of the bolts have been examined. Finite element models are created and validated to represent the behaviour observed in the laboratory. Different grip length configurations have been tested for a single bolt and nut assembly subjected to pure tension. Both partially and fully threaded bolts have been considered. It was found that partially threaded bolts with three threads between the unthreaded part of the shank and the bearing surface of the nut experienced thread stripping. This is inconsistent with the recommendations given in NS-EN 1090 - 2, which states that one <b>full</b> <b>thread</b> is sufficient to avoid thread stripping. Finite element models are able to recreate the behaviour of all configurations tested with acceptable accuracy. In addition to the grip length, the material properties and geometry of the threads are identified as the crucial factors for the failure modes of the bolts. Simple T-stub connections with one bolt in each flange have been tested to examine the behaviour of the bolts when they are subjected {{to a combination of}} tension and bending. The center distance between the bolts was varied to examine the behaviour when subjected to increased bending effects. Connections with partially threaded bolts all failed due to thread stripping. The fully threaded bolts experienced both thread stripping and bolt failure. The complexity of the stress distribution when large bending effects are present was difficult to recreate with a simplified finite element model. Acceptable accuracy up to maximum force was possible to achieve for the smallest bolt center distance. The response of the finite element model was very mesh sensitive, and difficult to recreate with limited computational capacity when applying an explicit solution algorithm...|$|E

40|$|Transfixation casting is {{a method}} of {{managing}} distal limb fractures in the horse. It has similarities to external skeletal fixation {{including the use of}} transcortical pins and the complications that occur as a result of concentrated stresses at the bone-pin interface. Currently, the major challenges facing equine surgeons when using a transfixation cast are pin loosening, secondary pin hole fracture and excessive stress reduction distal to the transcortical pins during healing. The equine distal limb transfixation cast was modeled from a computed tomography scan of a representative third metacarpal bone of the horse. Finite element analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of pin parameters on bone-pin interface stresses and strains. The parameters were pin diameter, number, type (half or <b>full,</b> <b>threaded</b> or smooth), spacing, orientation, location within the bone and pin material. The model was also used to determine the effect of the cast-pin interface attachment, and to determine the effect of increasing fracture tissue stiffness or external foot contact pressure, on bone-pin interface stresses. A general approach to transcortical pin selection was developed based on the total pin area moment of inertia of pins in the cast. Pin diameter and pin number had the most profound influence on bone-pin interface stresses. Cast-pin interface attachment influenced the bone-pin interface stresses and modeling a fixed pin end position underestimated bone-pin interface stresses. Increasing distal contact pressure and tissue modulus decreased bone-pin interface stresses and their distribution around pin holes. The results of this study will assist equine surgeons in improving transfixation casting in the horse by employing methods that help to minimize complications associated with the bone-pin interface that are currently limiting the clinical success of this technique. ...|$|R

40|$|The plastic {{behavior}} of fasteners in timber structures has gained {{more and more}} interest within recent years. In particular, dowel type fasteners show a significant ductile behavior if a certain embedded length of the dowel is ensured. The embedded length is either found by using the formulas based on the design codes (DIN (2008) [3], DIN EN 1995 - 1 - 1 [4], etc.) or by verifying the slenderness ratio ¿ (Jorissen (1998) [5] and Mischler et al. (2000) [32]). A further important issue is the prevention of splitting of the timber itself. <b>Full</b> <b>threaded</b> self-drilling screws enable an effective method to prevent the connection of such a failure (Bejtka (2005) [10]). Most of the inherent material properties of timber, except the behavior in compression, do not allow a plastic design in pure timber structures. Connections accomplished with dowel type fasteners however enable to bridge that gap. The ability of forming plastic hinges by ductile joints within statically undetermined systems provides substantial advantages for a structure. First and foremost, the capability to dissipate energy provides some benefits, such as the integration to the earthquake analysis {{and in addition to}} increase the robustness of the structure. A load redistribution within statically undetermined systems can also be achieved, and thereby the possibility of a higher utilization of the structural system. Within this paper, the possibility to redistribute internal forces in timber structures is shown and some application criteria to form plastic hinges are given. Since timber is an inhomogeneous material and is characterized by the scattering of the material properties, the influence of the scattering of the modulus of elasticity to the required rotation of the joint is presented. In order to implement the ductility to timber structures, it is necessary to appraise the ductility as an interaction of the different types of fasteners within timber. Based on conducted experiments the evaluation of the displacement at the point of yielding with respect to existing appraisal models is discussed. Furthermore, different existing methods to evaluate the point of yielding and the ductile {{behavior of}} fasteners in timber structures are discussed...|$|R

According to the estimated results the sequence-structure threading has assigned protein folds to more then 60 % of eukaryotic, 68 % of archaeal and 70 % of bacterial proteomes. The repertoires of protein classes, architectures, topologies and homologous superfamilies (according to the CATH 2. 4 classification) have been established for distant organisms and superkingdoms.

To delineate the origins of the HET-s prion-forming protein and to discover other amyloid-forming proteins, we searched for all homologs of the HET-s protein in a database of protein domains and fungal genomes, using a combined application of HMM, psi-blast and pGenThreader techniques, and performed a comparative evolutionary analysis of the N-terminal alpha-helical domain and the C-terminal prion-forming domain of HET-s. By assessing the tandem evolution of both domains, we observed that the prion-forming domain is restricted to Sordariomycetes, with a marginal additional sequence homolog in Arthroderma otae as a likely case of horizontal transfer. This suggests innovation and rapid evolution of the solenoid fold in the Sordariomycetes clade. In contrast, the N-terminal domain evolves at a slower rate (in Sordariomycetes) and spans many diverse clades of fungi. We performed a <b>full</b> three-dimensional protein <b>threading</b> analysis on all identified HET-s homologs against the HET-s solenoid fold, and present detailed structural annotations for identified structural homologs to the prion-forming domain. An analysis of the physicochemical characteristics in our set of structural models indicates that the HET-s solenoid shape can be readily adopted in these homologs, but that they are all less optimized for fibril formation than the P. anserina HET-s sequenc...|$|R
