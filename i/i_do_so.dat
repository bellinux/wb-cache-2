500|$|O'Brien {{claimed that}} all of the {{evidence}} given against him was false, and that as an American citizen he ought not to be facing trial in a UK court. He then went on at length to condemn the British government, the [...] "imbecile and tyrannical rulers" [...] of Ireland, until he was interrupted by the judge, who appealed to him to cease his remarks: [...] "The only effect of your observations must be to tell against you with those who have to consider the sentence.

500|$|In 1341, Shuhayb and a eunuch {{entered into}} a dispute related to a pigeon racing competition, in which the eunuch mistreated Shuhayb. In response, Ahmad had the eunuch {{severely}} beaten, and when news of the incident reached an-Nasir Muhammad, the latter attempted to force Ahmad to banish Shuhayb, again sending emirs Qawsun and Bashtak to communicate his demands to Ahmad. Ahmad refused, stating to Qawsun and Bashtak that while they each had a hundred young boys and girls, he had [...] "contented" [...] himself [...] "with regard to worldly pleasures with only this boy because he has shared my exile, having left his family. How can I expel him? If the sultan commands that <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> then let him expel me too". Ahmad was indeed expelled to Sarkhad, accompanied by Maliktamur. However, upon the intervention of some of an-Nasir Muhammad's emirs, wives and his harem, an-Nasir Muhammad decided to have Ahmad return to Cairo while Ahmad was still {{on his way to}} Sarkhad, although he first sold all of Ahmad's horses. An-Nasir Muhammad also ultimately decided to send Ahmad back to al-Karak with Maliktamur, who was also reappointed governor of Mamlakat al-Karak.|$|E
500|$|In August 2013, Jared Leto told MTV News {{that he was}} {{preparing}} to shoot a short film for [...] "City of Angels". While he did not reveal much about the music video concept, he added: [...] "It's going to be powerful and emotional and definitely something special." [...] The shooting took place from August 16–17 in Los Angeles, filming multiple monoliths and murals. Leto interviewed celebrities who joined the three members of Thirty Seconds to Mars in sharing their visions about Los Angeles. He also recruited Michael Jackson and Marilyn Monroe impersonators as well as homeless people {{in the production of}} the video. After filming, Leto talked about the inspiration behind the video, stating, [...] "Telling stories {{is a big part of}} what <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> <b>so</b> it was a really natural and comfortable thing. I think because I did all the interviews myself—I talked to fellow artists and they felt really comfortable. They shared a side of themselves that we don't share very often." [...] Footage from the song's lyric video, which was shot atop the Hollywood Hills, was used for a part of the short film that featured Leto singing the song against the backdrop of a Los Angeles sunset.|$|E

As the subject gives attention to the touch of your thumb, you shift to a touch with your little finger. As your subject's attention follows that, you shift to a touch with your middle finger and then again to the thumb.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{his poor}} form Martyn was widely {{expected}} to retain his place due to Shane Watson's lack of fitness {{and the fact}} that the third test was to be played at the W.A.C.A. Ground, Martyn's home ground. It came as a surprise when on 8 December 2006, Martyn announced his immediate retirement from all domestic and international cricket. Commenting on his decision, Martyn said: [...] "I would like to advise of my retirement from cricket, effective from today. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> with a deep awareness of the opportunities that the game and Cricket Australia have provided for me." [...] Cricket Australia CEO James Sutherland insisted that Martyn had not been pushed and that Martyn was originally going to be named in the squad for the third Test.|$|E
2500|$|Kucinich held a {{press conference}} on the evening of April 24, 2007, {{revealing}} House Resolution 333 and the three articles of impeachment against Cheney. He charged Cheney with manipulating the evidence of Iraq's weapons program, deceiving the nation about Iraq's connection to al-Qaeda, and threatening aggression against Iran in violation of the United Nations charter. Kucinich opened his press conference by quoting from the Declaration of Independence, and stated: [...] "I believe the Vice President's conduct of office has been destructive to the founding purposes of our nation. Today, I have introduced House Resolution 333, Articles of Impeachment Relating to Vice President Richard B. Cheney. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> in defense of the rights of the American people to have a government that is honest and peaceful." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 18 April, the {{cardinals}} assembled in St. Peter's Basilica {{in the morning}} to concelebrate the mass Pro Eligendo Romano Pontifice (For the Election of the Roman Pontiff). As Dean of the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger was the principal concelebrant. He chose to give the homily himself. In the afternoon, {{the cardinals}} assembled in the Hall of Blessings for the procession to the Sistine Chapel. The cardinals proceeded to the Sistine Chapel while the Litany of Saints was chanted. After taking their places the [...] "Veni Creator Spiritus" [...] ("Come, Creator Spirit") was sung. Cardinal Ratzinger read the oath. Each cardinal elector beginning with Ratzinger, followed by Vice Dean Angelo Sodano and the other cardinals in order of seniority, affirmed the oath by placing his hands on the book of the Gospels saying aloud: [...] "And <b>I,</b> , <b>do</b> <b>so</b> promise, pledge and swear. So help me God and these Holy Gospels which I touch with my hand." ...|$|E
2500|$|Right upon {{setting up}} camp in Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, Romanian troops joined the Wehrmacht and the Schutzstaffel-organized Einsatzgruppen in mass shootings of Bessarabian and Ukrainian Jews, {{resulting}} {{in the deaths of}} 10,000 to 20,000 people. Scholar Christopher R. Browning compares these killings with similar atrocities perpetrated by locals in Reichskommissariat Ukraine, Lithuania and Latvia (see Holocaust in Latvia, Holocaust in Lithuania, Holocaust in Ukraine). From then on, as the fighting troops progressed over the Dniester, the local administration deported large numbers of Jews into the fighting zone, in hopes that they would be exterminated by the Germans. Antonescu himself stated: [...] "I am in favor of expelling the Jews from Bessarabia and [...] Bukovina {{to the other side of}} the border [...] There is nothing for them to do here and I don't mind if we appear in history as barbarians [...] There has never been a time more suitable in our history to get rid of the Jews, and if necessary, you are to make use of machine guns against them." [...] He also explained that his aim was: [...] "the policy of purification of the Romanian race, and I will not give way before any obstacle in achieving this historical goal of our nation. If we do not take advantage of the situation which presents itself today [...] we shall miss the last chance that history offers to us. And I do not wish to miss it, because if <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> further generations will blame me." [...] He made a contradictory statement about the murder of Jews in Chișinău, claiming that their perpetrators were [...] "bastards" [...] who [...] "stained" [...] his regime's reputation. Antonescu saw the [...] "war" [...] against the Jews as being just as important as the war against the Soviet Union, and regularly demanded reports from his officers in Bessarabia and Transnistria about their measures against the Jews. In late August 1941 in Tighina Antonescu called a secret conference attended by himself, the governors of Bessarabia and Bukovina and the governor-designate of Transnistria to discuss his plans regarding the Jews in those regions.|$|E
