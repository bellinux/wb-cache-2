5|$|It soon {{becomes clear}} that MacPherson is being poisoned. Nikola {{believes}} that Brandt is responsible, because of his recent disappearances, but is proven wrong. After MacPherson dies, Sarah Walker takes his place as commander of Strike Force Centauri. Walker sends Nikola, disguised as a pirate, on an espionage mission to discover the traitor's identity. Nikola finds information that incriminates Ashford, who, when confronted, boasts of his actions and leaps to his death from a <b>docking</b> <b>bay.</b> The squad continues the war, and the Hegemony is eventually forced to gather its remaining forces at a base on Thatcher. The squad destroys the facility by detonating a highly explosive fuel tank inside it. Following its defeat, the Hegemony denies involvement in the war, declares Pentheus a rogue agent and appoints a new ambassador to the system. While angered by the announcement, Strike Force Centauri celebrates its victory as the game ends.|$|E
5|$|In a later {{version of}} the film, Auto comes to the <b>docking</b> <b>bay</b> to {{retrieve}} EVE's plant. The film would have its first cutaway to the captain, but Stanton moved that as he found it too early to begin moving away from WALL-E's point-of-view. As an homage to Get Smart, Auto takes the plant and goes into {{the bowels of the}} ship into a room resembling a brain where he watches videos of Buy n Large's scheme to clean up the Earth falling apart through the years. Stanton removed this to keep some mystery as to why the plant is taken from EVE. The captain appears to be unintelligent, but Stanton wanted him to just be unchallenged; otherwise he would have been unempathetic. One example of how unintelligent the captain was depicted initially is that he was seen to wear his hat upside-down, only to fix it before he challenges Auto. In the finished film, he merely wears it casually atop his head, tightening it when he assumes real command of the Axiom.|$|E
25|$|Factories are {{stations}} {{which use}} resources {{to create one}} or many products. The needed resources and produced wares need to be transported by a ship. Traders in the universe must move wares between the factories to keep production going; if supply exceeds demand a factory will often stop producing goods. The player can build factories by buying them at a shipyard and loading them on board a large transport ship (TL class). The player factories can own their own ships to buy resources and sell products. There are many factory options to configure the trader ships behaviour and job. Player factories can also connect to each other to share resources and products. The factories are connected through tubes and the <b>docking</b> <b>bay</b> is moved to a central complex hub.|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} of its release, Atlantis: The Lost Empire was notable for using more computer-generated imagery (CGI) than any other Disney {{traditionally}} animated feature. To increase productivity, the directors had the digital artists work with the traditional animators throughout the production. Several important scenes required heavy use of digital animation: the Leviathan, the Ulysses submarine and sub-pods, the Heart of Atlantis, and the Stone Giants. During production, after Matt Codd and Jim Martin designed the Ulysses on paper, Greg Aronowitz was hired to build a scale model of the submarine, {{to be used as a}} reference for drawing the 3D Ulysses. The final film included 362 digital-effects shots, and computer programs were used to seamlessly join the 2D and 3D artwork. One scene that took advantage of this was the [...] "sub-drop" [...] scene, where the 3D Ulysses was dropped from its <b>docking</b> <b>bay</b> into the water. As the camera floated toward it, a 2D Milo was drawn to appear inside, tracking the camera. The crew noted that it was challenging to keep the audience from noticing the difference between the 2D and 3D drawings when they were merged. The digital production also gave the directors a unique [...] "virtual camera" [...] for complicated shots within the film. With the ability to operate in the z-plane, this camera moved through a digital wire-frame set; the background and details were later hand-drawn over the wire frames. This was used in the opening flight scene through Atlantis and the submarine chase through the undersea cavern with the Leviathan in pursuit.|$|E
2500|$|The opening shot of Star Wars, {{in which}} a {{detailed}} spaceship fills the screen overhead, is {{a reference to the}} scene introducing the interplanetary spacecraft Discovery One in Stanley Kubrick's seminal 1968 film [...] The earlier big-budget science fiction film influenced the look of Star Wars in many other ways, including the use of EVA pods and hexagonal corridors. The Death Star has a <b>docking</b> <b>bay</b> reminiscent of the one on the orbiting space station in 2001. Although golden and male, C-3PO was inspired by the silver female robot Maria, the Maschinenmensch from Fritz Lang's 1927 film Metropolis.|$|E
2500|$|Fuel can be {{replenished}} after docking with a space station, {{which requires}} matching the ship's rotation {{to that of}} the station before entering the <b>docking</b> <b>bay</b> - a task that can be avoided by purchasing a docking computer. Equipment upgrades include a fuel scoop, which allows raw fuel to be skimmed from the surface of stars, described by the manual as [...] "a dangerous and difficult activity", but in practice a fairly simple process far easier than manually docking at a space stationâ€”and collecting free-floating cargo canisters and escape capsules liberated after the destruction of other ships.|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} written {{reference to}} Five Dock is in The Sydney Gazette of 3 February 1805, which mentions Five <b>Dock</b> <b>Bay.</b> However, the name probably {{dates back to}} the days of the First Settlement.

[...] Vima then goes off to the <b>docking</b> <b>bay,</b> stowing away on a ship, intent on finding her own trainer. Also in the <b>docking</b> <b>bay</b> is Tott, who asks Sylvar to come with him to Ryloth, {{in order to deal with}} the anger within her.|$|E

5000|$|As {{the game}} progressed, the Omega Virus would [...] "shut down" [...] sectors {{he did not}} occupy. In this case, the {{cardboard}} flap would be folded over the said sector and all players in it were teleported to another sector's <b>docking</b> <b>bay</b> of their choosing.|$|E
