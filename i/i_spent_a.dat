After this time the town was largely rebuilt including Waterloo House and Manor Court House in Fore Street which were built as a house and courtroom, and have now been converted into shops and offices. Further damage to the town {{took place during the}} English Civil War with both sides plundering its resources, particularly in 1644 when Charles <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> week in the town.|$|E
5|$|That {{first night}} of my {{imprisonment}} was the longest night I have ever passed in my life; {{it seemed as though}} the dawn of day would never come. I found in my bag a small Book of Common Prayer according to the ritual of the Episcopal Church. It was a great comfort to me, and before retiring to rest Mrs. Clark and <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> few minutes in the devotions appropriate to the evening. Here, perhaps, I may say, that although I had been a regular attendant on the Presbyterian worship since my childhood, a constant contributor to all the missionary societies, and had helped to build their churches and ornament the walls, giving my time and my musical ability freely to make their meetings attractive to my people, yet none of these pious church members or clergymen remembered me in my prison. To this (Christian ?) conduct I contrast that of the Anglican bishop, Rt. Rev. Alfred Willis, who visited me {{from time to time in}} my house, and in whose church I have since been confirmed as a communicant. But he was not allowed to see me at the palace.|$|E

I mixed this in the fantastic penthouse room in Jungle City. This record was, of course, about the vocals — {{but a lot of}} it was about the production elements too. Everything had to be audible; there's some interesting percussion, and the hook had to feel nice and big.|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} {{to some of}} these criticisms, Coto stated that he personally considered the two-part story [...] "" [...] and [...] "Terra Prime" [...] that preceded [...] "These Are the Voyages..." [...] the actual finale of the Enterprise storyline. Berman said [...] "I've read a lot of the criticisms and I understand how some people feel, but [...] and <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> lot of time coming up with the idea and a somewhat, I would say, unique ending to a series, especially when you’re ending it prematurely. [...] You never like to disappoint people, but I think it's nonsense {{to say that it was}} more a Next Generation episode than an Enterprise episode. The only elements of [...] that were present were there as a sounding board to allow us to look at a mission that took place six years after [...] "Terra Prime"." ...|$|E
500|$|All of {{the songs}} on Illinois were written, recorded, engineered, and {{produced}} by Stevens, {{with most of the}} material being recorded at The Buddy Project studio in Astoria, Queens, and in Stevens' Brooklyn apartment. As with his previous albums, Stevens recorded in various locations, with additional piano recorded in St. Paul's Church in Brooklyn; strings and vocals performed in collaborators' apartments; electronic organ recorded in the New Jerusalem Recreational Room in Clarksboro, New Jersey; and vibraphone played at Carroll Music Studios in New York City. Stevens mostly created the album without collaboration, focusing on the writing, performance, and technical creation of the album by himself: [...] "I was pretty nearsighted in the construction of Illinois. <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> lot of time alone, a few months in isolation working on my own and in the studio. I let things germinate and cultivate independently, without thinking about an audience or a live show at all." ...|$|E
500|$|A piano version also {{appeared}} on the DVD single, which was assisted in its creation by Nico Muhly. During an interview he stated, [...] "When Björk asked me to play piano on Oceania, she sent me the music, {{and it was as}} complicated and layered as any piece of classical music I've played. <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> few days figuring out how to make her vision of 'dueling lounge-lizard pianists' physically possible, and in the session, we ran through those quickly. Then, she experimented with different ways to space the progression of chords that runs through the piece - I suggested big, Brahmsy blocks - as well as the ending, for which we tried diaphanous, Debussy-like arpeggios". Björk decided to stick with the album's vocal concept and use electronically tweaked choral voices. Before some last-minute polishing by Mark Bell, this version of [...] "Oceania" [...] was the last track to be worked for Medúlla.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Alton dryly, [...] "I {{found more}} than that, for I ran into a man's trail, and it wasn't very old. I think he had long boots on and one was down at the heel. <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>an</b> hour over it, and when it led me into rock came back again." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Larry Charles and {{directed}} by Tom Cherones, who directed all of the episodes in Season 2. [...] "The Statue" [...] was the second episode Charles wrote for the show, though {{it was the first}} to be aired. Charles was mostly interested {{in the development of the}} Kramer character, as he felt [...] "Jerry and George were so well-defined through Larry [...] and Jerry, that there was less room for me to, sort of, expand on those personas. But Kramer was very unformed at the beginning of the show and it gave me an area of creativity to, sort of, expand upon. So <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> lot of time with Kramer because he was a character that I could have an impact on in the future of the show". Richards enjoyed how his character evolved and, after the filming of the episode, went to Seinfeld, Charles and David and said [...] "we should keep going that way." [...] He cites this episode, as well as [...] "The Revenge" [...] (in which Kramer puts concrete in a washing machine), as episodes that really defined the character.|$|E
500|$|Since Valene, I’ve {{tried to}} do {{anything}} and everything but play a goody-two-shoes. I love Val, I adore her. But <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> total of 15 years—if you count the first year I played her on Dallas. That was quite an investment for me as an actress. If you were playing a goody-two-shoes today, the tabloid media would be dying to catch you on a bad day. [...] Look at what they’ve done to Tiger Woods. Look at what they’ve done to that man. My feeling is his father—or the absence of his father in his life—is (the root of) what’s going on with Tiger and that marriage. But the media won’t leave him alone. No matter who you are, (the celebrity coverage) is obsessive and constant. It’s hurtful. For me, if they show my face in a bad photo, they latch into me hook, line and sinker. Even Entertainment Tonight now has blood on their hands. It's brutal. I wonder what they’ll do with Alec Baldwin now. He was my brother on Knots. They really threw him under a bus (when endlessly publicizing his infamous voice-mail rant against daughter Ireland, then 11, in 2007). He loves that child so much." ...|$|E
500|$|Jennings' work on In Search of America and the September 11 attacks {{contributed to}} his {{decision}} in 2003 to become a dual citizen of Canada and the United States. [...] "I think that 9/11 and the subsequent travel I did in the country afterwards made me feel connected in new ways," [...] he said. [...] "And when {{we were working on}} the America project <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> {{lot of time on the}} road, which meant away from my editor's desk, and I just got much more connected to the Founding Fathers' dreams and ideas for the future." [...] His work had prepared him well for the citizenship test, which he passed easily. [...] "Can you imagine I, who just finished a whole series on America and had been an anchorperson for an American broadcast...could you imagine if I had failed?" [...] he asked. [...] "It would have been horrendous." [...] The anchor's formal pledge of allegiance took place at a regular citizenship ceremony on May 30 in Lower Manhattan. The occasion overwhelmed him. [...] "I went in the front door and came out the front door. They were regular people. They were very touching. And I cried a little bit — my kids didn't cry, but I cried a bit — but I'm a fairly emotional character anyway." ...|$|E

500|$|Azalea {{wrote the}} song with The Invisible Men, Trocon Markous Roberts and Natalie Sims. Sims stated that she, FKi, and Azalea had {{initially}} met back in 2008, but lost touch when Azalea moved to Los Angeles. The track specifically {{drew inspiration from}} a period when Azalea suffered from depression, and {{dropped out of high}} school to become a domestic worker with her mother. Azalea saved money for a flight ticket to Miami and left Mullumbimby, New South Wales before she turned 16—an event referenced in the song's lyric [...] "No money / No family / 16 in the middle of Miami" [...] which Azalea felt [...] "said it all". For this reason, she chose to write and record [...] "Work" [...] in isolation in Rockfield, Monmouthshire, with no phone reception, visitors or interruptions. She felt as a location it would help her recall the personal struggles she wanted to write about on the song. Azalea also believed that her best output was produced when in an environment outside her comfort zone. Her vocals were recorded at Rockfield Studios and Monnow Valley Studios. Sims, who abandoned four tour dates in order to fly over to Britain to join Azalea, commented on her own involvement in the song that [...] "Fresh out of a breakup and depressed <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> month in London in a small 10×10 studio somedays writing and writing and writing… Regardless of whether or not you like the content the song told Iggy's true story of struggle sacrifice and hard work as an artist." ...|$|E
500|$|Swivel {{dedicated}} {{much time}} in getting the vocal sound right, which according to him is crucial while working with Beyoncé's music. He further explained, [...] "I only put a quick EQ on the vocal {{at the end of}} a recording session if I have been cutting her, but mixing is far more particular, so <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> lot of time dialling in the perfect frequency." [...] For the delay throws in the verses on [...] "I Care", he sent it through a large hall reverb at 50 percent — half reverb, half clean — then through an Amp Farm plug‑in for the grittiness, and that then went through a quarter‑note delay. In the bridge, é matches the guitar solo vocally — that was doubled — and one of the vocal tracks has an Amp Farm on it to add to that grittiness. To do justice to the multitude of vocal tracks within the song, Swivel created a stereo field using some clever panning techniques and a Waves S1 Imager plug‑in. He said that it was worth noting that whenever he mixes a record, [...] "I hate hard‑panned L/R. To get the right width, I pan them all differently in pairs: 40/40, 60/60, 70/70, 80/80, 90/90, and OK, maybe one is 100/100, but this process is ultimately what creates the stereo field." [...] Swivel used Waves' SSL E‑Channel plug‑in to shape Beyoncé's lead vocal. He took a Waves S1 Imager and spread with that without isolating he width. He added that something is hard‑panned, it feels too isolated and also confuses the listener's ears. Swivel explained further, [...] "I like smooth sound, and with B that works fine as she’s so good at matching everything. I like a wall of background vocals. It's the best way of putting your vocal in every area of the stereo field: a wide sound, but you’ve still got something there in the middle." ...|$|E

It was not necessary to talk down to her. She was essentially urban in tone while other of the girls who had once impressed me with their beauty had taken on the airs of village matrons and did not interest me.

[...] During a 2001 interview with Bob Costas, Hank was asked whether he would have an Oscar or a Heisman Trophy. Hank replied he would rather win a Heisman by playing halfback for the California Golden Bears. Hanks told New York magazine in 1986, [...] "Acting classes looked like {{the best place for}} a guy who liked {{to make a lot of}} noise and be rather flamboyant. <b>I</b> <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> lot of time going to plays.
