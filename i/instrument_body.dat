2500|$|Physical {{modelling}} synthesis is {{the synthesis}} of sound by using a set of equations and algorithms to simulate each sonic characteristic of [...] an instrument, starting with the harmonics {{that make up the}} tone itself, then adding the sound of the resonator, the <b>instrument</b> <b>body,</b> etc., until the sound realistically approximates the desired instrument. When an initial set of parameters is run through the physical simulation, the simulated sound is generated. Although physical modeling was not a new concept in acoustics and synthesis, {{it was not until the}} development of the Karplus-Strong algorithm and the increase in DSP power in the late 1980s that commercial implementations became feasible. The quality and speed of physical modeling on computers improves with higher processing power.|$|E

50|$|The {{innovation}} {{brought from}} VMCM over other current meters {{results from the}} choice of the biaxial propeller sensors, developed with accurate cosine response, and the design of the instrument so that flow interference with the <b>instrument</b> <b>body</b> was minimized.|$|E
50|$|For 2011 VOX has reintroduced {{the iconic}} droplet body shape {{in its new}} APACHE Series. These travel guitars feature the {{original}} styling and host a 2-channel guitar amplifier, 2 speakers, dozens of rhythm patterns, and an E-String tuner, {{all of which are}} built into the <b>instrument</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E
50|$|These {{components}} may {{be integrated}} into the <b>instrument</b> <b>body</b> or modularized in different ways. The hexaphonic pickup may be a separate component added to the guitar, or it may be built-in. Earlier guitar-synths required the musician to use a proprietary guitar with an integrated hexaphonic pickup.|$|E

50|$|The <b>instrument's</b> <b>body</b> is very small, but its {{fingerboard}} is made long {{relative to}} the instrument's overall size {{in order to preserve}} as much of the instrument's melodic range as possible.|$|R
50|$|The contra-alto flute (also called {{contrabass}} flute in G) {{is in the}} key of G, pitched one octave {{below the}} alto flute, and a fourth below the bass flute. It is so large that the <b>instrument's</b> <b>body</b> is held vertically, with an adjustable floor peg {{similar to that of}} the bass clarinet.|$|R

The [...] "foot" [...] is {{on the bottom of}} the neck, and affords a large gluing surface to the back of the instrument.|$|E
50|$|The Bulgarian tambura has 8 steel strings in 4 doubled courses. All {{the courses}} are tuned in unison, with no octaves. It is tuned D3 D3, G3 G3, B3 B3, E4 E4. It has a {{floating}} bridge and a metal tailpiece. The <b>instrument</b> <b>body</b> is often carved {{from a single}} block of wood and is therefore quite heavy.|$|E
50|$|In a free-reed instrument, it is {{generally}} the physical characteristics of the reed itself, such as mass, length, cross-sectional area, and stiffness, which determine the pitch (frequency) of the musical note produced. Of secondary importance to the pitch are the physical dimensions of the chamber in which the reed is fitted, and of the air flow. As an exception, the pitch of the Chinese bawu and hulusi are determined by fingering recorder-like tone holes along the <b>instrument</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E
50|$|The leiqin {{is played}} while the player is {{seated in a}} chair, with the <b>instrument's</b> <b>body</b> resting {{in his or her}} lap and held in a {{vertical}} or near-vertical position.

5000|$|In the Vietnamese language, đàn is a {{classifier}} {{used primarily}} {{to refer to}} string instruments, and đáy means [...] "bottom." [...] Thus, the instrument's name translates literally as [...] "bottom string instrument." [...] However, the <b>instrument's</b> <b>body</b> has no back. According to this website, the instrument was originally called vô để cầm, literally [...] "bottomless stringed instrument." ...|$|R
50|$|The contra alto flute {{is in the}} key of G (or {{sometimes}} F), pitched one octave {{below the}} alto flute - which is a forth lower then the concert flute. The <b>instrument's</b> <b>body</b> is sometimes held vertically, with an adjustable floor peg {{similar to that of}} the bass clarinet. But, it is sometimes held horizontally. It just depends on the company.|$|R
50|$|The Mark V {{instrument}} {{dispensed with}} the guide bar and own ship's bar, retaining {{only the two}} position bars. However, the circular base plate was added to by the provision of two celluloid transparent discs which were placed {{on top of the}} base and free to rotate. The <b>instrument</b> <b>body</b> was made of an aluminium alloy and had a scale graded in degrees around the outside. The base plate had no scale, but a series of interrupted parallel lines running across it. This device was in production around 1955.|$|E

5000|$|Acoustic guitars are {{commonly}} constructed {{in several different}} body types. In general, the guitar's soundbox {{can be thought of}} as composed of two connected chambers: the upper bouts and lower bouts (a bout being the rounded corner of an <b>instrument</b> <b>body),</b> which meet at the waist, or the narrowest part of the body face near the soundhole. The proportion and overall size of these two parts helps determine the overall tonal balance and [...] "native sound" [...] of a particular body style - the larger the body, the louder the volume.|$|E
5000|$|Jay Lichty creates all the {{instruments}} by hand using {{a wide variety}} of domestic and exotic hardwoods including Indian rosewood, Brazilian rosewood, pau ferro, cocobolo, lacewood, hormigo, koa, mahogany, ziricote, ancient kauri, maple, claro walnut and others for the <b>instrument</b> <b>bodies.</b> Types of wood used for the soundboards include lutz, englemann, sitka, Adirondack spruces, Western red cedar, sinker redwood, koa, and mahogany.|$|R
50|$|Krakebs {{are similar}} to large iron {{castanets}} {{in that they are}} handheld cymbal-type instruments which are handmade from iron or steel. They are Idiophones, meaning that their sound comes from the vibration of the <b>instrument's</b> <b>body.</b> The body is four cymbals (two on each side) attached by a string. Since they are played with one hand, the musician usually holds one in each to play simultaneously.|$|R
50|$|Krylovidnye gusli ("wing-shaped gusli"; Крыловидные гусли) is much smaller, and {{has more}} {{resemblance}} to Baltic psaltery such as the kankles, kokles, kannel and kantele. They are held much more like modern guitars (although the strings are still muted by the left hand through a special opening in the <b>instrument's</b> <b>body).</b> This modification was more prevalent in northern parts of Russia, especially Novgorod and Pskov.|$|R
50|$|The Macedonian tambura has 4 steel strings in 2 doubled courses. It is tuned A A , D D (or another pitch but at {{the same}} {{relative}} intervals of a fourth) when playing melodies based on A tonic upon A drone. It also may be tuned G G , D D (or another pitch {{but at the}} same relative intervals of a fifth) when playing melodies based on G tonic upon G drone. Sometimes octave strings are used on the lower course. It has a floating bridge and a metal tailpeice. The <b>instrument</b> <b>body</b> is more often made from staves like a lute.|$|E
50|$|In 1974, he {{partnered with}} Marc McElwee and Gary Kramer to start Travis Bean Guitars, which made {{high-end}} electric guitars and basses featuring machined aluminum necks. This {{was an unusual}} design, departing from more traditional wood necked instruments. The aluminum center section ran through the <b>instrument</b> <b>body,</b> with the pickups directly mounted to the aluminum. The majority of these instruments featured solid koa wood bodies and humbucker pickups. Though praised for their sound, the use of aluminum necks also made Travis Bean guitars heavier than other electric guitars. Models included the Artist, Standard, Wedge (rare), and TB500 (rare) with single coil pickups.|$|E
5000|$|The Hartmann Neuron was an {{electronic}} musical instrument {{designed and built}} by industry designer Axel Hartmann of the German company Hartmann Music in the years 2001-2005. The Neuron synthesizer used an Artificial Neural Network to create a digital computer model from sampled sounds, implementing a new synthesis technology which was developed by Stephan Bernsee at Prosoniq. This computer model could then be used to resynthesize a new sound, giving the player control over [...] "musical" [...] aspects such as <b>instrument</b> <b>body</b> size, material and other acoustic properties. This parametric approach {{is very different from}} the more mathematical approaches of other synthesizers.|$|E
50|$|An {{extension}} to DWG synthesis of strings made by Smith is commuted synthesis, wherein the excitation to the digital waveguide contains both string excitation {{and the body}} response of the instrument. This is possible because the digital waveguide is linear and makes it unnecessary to model the <b>instrument</b> <b>body's</b> resonances after synthesizing the string output, greatly {{reducing the number of}} computations required for a convincing resynthesis.|$|R
5000|$|Kanklės of Northwestern Samogitians and Suvalkians: {{usually the}} most {{decorated}} type, and kanklės used in concert performance {{are most often}} based on this variety. The most prominent identifying feature is {{the addition of a}} carved spiral figure to the point of the <b>instrument's</b> <b>body</b> and sometimes, the rounding of the narrow end of the <b>body.</b> Typically these <b>instruments</b> have between nine and thirteen strings.|$|R
50|$|The keywork of {{most modern}} woodwinds, {{including}} wooden-bodied instruments, is also usually made of an alloy such as Nickel Silver/German Silver. Such alloys are stiffer and more durable than the brass {{used to construct}} the <b>instrument</b> <b>bodies,</b> but still workable with simple hand tools -- a boon to quick repairs. The mouthpieces of both brass instruments and, less commonly, woodwind instruments are often made of brass, among other metals, as well.|$|R

5000|$|By {{imitating the}} long, thin snout of the garfish {{protruding}} into the security sphere of the alert herrings, an endoscope with a tip diameter of 11 mm is used. The endoscope is camouflaged {{to reduce the}} brightness-contrast against the background: the top is black and the sides are silvery. Additionally, {{the front of the}} ROV is covered by a mirror, reflecting a light gradient resembling the natural scene and making the <b>instrument</b> <b>body</b> virtually invisible to the animals. A second sensor images other copepods, phytoplankton and particles at very high magnification. Another advantage of these small [...] "optical probes" [...] is the minimal disruption of the current-field in the measuring volume, allowing for less disturbed surveys of microturbulence and shear.|$|E
50|$|Wolf tones {{are usually}} only noticed on bowed instruments, {{most notably the}} violin family, since the tones {{produced}} are played for much longer periods, and thus are easier to hear. Frequently, the wolf is present on or in between the pitches E and F on the cello, and around G on the double bass.A wolf can be reduced or eliminated {{with a piece of}} equipment called a wolf tone eliminator. This is a metal tube and mounting screw with an interior rubber sleeve, that fits around the offending string below the bridge. Different placements of this tube along the string influence or eliminate the frequency at which the wolf occurs. It is essentially an attenuator that slightly shifts the natural frequency of the string (and/or <b>instrument</b> <b>body)</b> cutting down on the reverberation.|$|E
5000|$|Piezoelectric pickups (also called [...] "piezo" [...] pickups) are {{non-magnetic}} pickups {{that use}} a transducer to convert vibrations in the <b>instrument's</b> <b>body</b> or bridge into an electrical signal. They are typically mounted {{under the bridge}} saddle or near the bridge and produce a different tone from magnetic pickups, often {{similar to that of}} an acoustic bass. Piezo pickups are often used in acoustic bass guitars to allow for amplification without a microphone.|$|R
40|$|A hyper-dimensional finite-difference time-domain mesh {{structure}} and {{its application to}} artificial reverberation modeling is introduced. It is shown to produce reverberation with a dense and irregular modal pattern beneficial for modeling the reverberation in rooms or musical <b>instrument</b> <b>bodies</b> at high frequencies. An example design of a four-dimensional FDTD mesh is analysed. The computational cost of the fourdimensional mesh is shown to be {{lower than that of}} a bank of second-order resonators producing the same number of modes. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} an improved way of estimating parameters for an integrated weighted-mixture model consisting of both harmonic and inharmonic tone models. Our final {{goal is to}} build an instrument equalizer (music remixer) that enables a user to change the volume of parts of polyphonic sound mixtures. To realize the instrument equalizer, musical signals must be separated into each musical instrument part. We have developed a score-informed sound source separation method using the integrated model. A remaining but critical problem {{is to find a}} way to deal with timbre varieties caused by various performance styles and <b>instrument</b> <b>bodies</b> because our method used template sounds to represent their timbre. Template sounds are generated from a MIDI tone generator based on an aligned score. Difference of <b>instrument</b> <b>bodies</b> between mixed signals and template sounds causes timbre difference and decreases separation performance. To solve this problem, we train probabilistic distributions of timbre features using various sounds to reduce template dependency. By adding a new constraint of maximizing the likelihood of timbre features extracted from each tone model, we can estimate model parameters that express the timbre more accurately. Experimental results show that separation performance improved from 4. 89 to 8. 48 dB. 1...|$|R
