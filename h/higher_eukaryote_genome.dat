40|$|N-terminal-ubiquitinylation (NTU) is a newly {{discovered}} protein degradation pathway initiated by ubiquitin-tagging of the N-terminal α-amino group. We have used data from recent genomic studies, especially those on humans, to up-date and re-interpret biochemical data {{to identify the}} sequence features associated with NTU. We compared a mini-proteome for which experimental protein sequence is available with large-scale genomic data. We conclude that N-α-acetylation involves less than 30 %, and not the widely assumed 90 %, of the proteins encoded by any <b>higher</b> <b>eukaryote</b> <b>genome,</b> greatly increasing thereby the number of possible targets for NTU-mediated degradation. Next, straightforward rules linking the first N-terminal residues of any nascent polypeptides {{to the nature of}} their processed N-termini are established and dedicated prediction tool is made available at [URL] We provide strong arguments indicating that the nature of the processed N-terminus is a major determinant factor of the half-life of the protein. We finally reveal that one third of the nuclear-encoded proteins starting with an unprocessed and unblocked methionine are at least one order of magnitude less stable than is average in higher eukaryotes. This appears to be the first common feature of proteins undergoing N-terminal ubiquitinylation. Hence, a pool of about 3000 proteins in each proteome could be unstable per se and tagged for rapid degradation via NTU...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Many {{statistical}} algorithms combine microarray expression {{data and}} genome sequence data to identify transcription factor binding motifs {{in the low}} eukaryotic genomes. Finding cis-regulatory elements in <b>higher</b> <b>eukaryote</b> <b>genomes,</b> however, remains a challenge, as searching in the promoter regions of genes with similar expression patterns often fails. The difficulty is partially attributable to the poor performance of the similarity measures for comparing expression profiles. The widely accepted measures are inadequate for distinguishing genes transcribed from distinct regulatory mechanisms in the complicated <b>genomes</b> of <b>higher</b> <b>eukaryotes.</b> Results By defining the regulatory similarity between a gene pair {{as the number of}} common known transcription factor binding motifs in the promoter regions, we compared the performance of several expression distance measures on seven mouse expression data sets. We propose a new distance measure that accounts for both the linear trends and fold-changes of expression across the samples. Conclusion The study reveals that the proposed distance measure for comparing expression profiles enables us to identify genes with large number of common regulatory elements because it reflects the inherent regulatory information better than widely accepted distance measures such as the Pearson's correlation or cosine correlation with or without log transformation. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} analyse the {{frequency}} of point mutations in whole plants, several constructs containing single nonsense mutations in the β-glucuronidase (uidA) gene were used to generate transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants. Upon histochemical staining of transgenic plants, sectors indicative of transgene reactivation appeared. Reversion frequencies were {{in the range of}} 10 – 7 – 10 – 8 events per base pair, exceeding the previous estimates for other eukaryotes at least 100 -fold. The frequency was dependent on the position of the mutation substrate within the transgene and the position of the transgene within the Arabidopsis genome. An inverse relationship between the level of transgene transcription and mutation frequency was observed in single-copy lines. DNA-damaging factors induced the mutation frequency by a factor of up to 56 for UV-C, a factor of 3 for X-rays and a factor of 2 for methyl methanesulfonate. This novel plant mutation-monitoring system allowed us to measure the frequencies of point mutation in whole plants and may be used as an alternative or complement to study the mutagenicity of different environmental factors on the <b>higher</b> <b>eukaryote’s</b> <b>genome...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background During {{the past}} decade, Sanger {{sequencing}} {{has been used}} to completely sequence hundreds of microbial and a few <b>higher</b> <b>eukaryote</b> <b>genomes.</b> In recent years, a number of alternative technologies became available, among them adaptations of the pyrosequencing procedure (i. e. " 454 sequencing"), promising a ~ 100 -fold increase in throughput over Sanger technology – an advancement which is needed to make large and complex genomes more amenable to full genome sequencing at affordable costs. Although several studies have demonstrated its potential usefulness for sequencing small and compact microbial genomes, it was unclear how the new technology would perform in large and highly repetitive genomes such as those of wheat or barley. Results To study its performance in complex genomes, we used 454 technology to sequence four barley Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) clones and compared the results to those from ABI-Sanger sequencing. All gene containing regions were covered efficiently and at high quality with 454 sequencing whereas repetitive sequences were more problematic with 454 sequencing than with ABI-Sanger sequencing. 454 sequencing provided a much more even coverage of the BAC clones than ABI-Sanger sequencing, resulting in almost complete assembly of all genic sequences even at only 9 to 10 -fold coverage. To obtain highly advanced working draft sequences for the BACs, we developed a strategy to assemble large parts of the BAC sequences by combining comparative genomics, detailed repeat analysis and use of low-quality reads from 454 sequencing. Additionally, we describe an approach of including small numbers of ABI-Sanger sequences to produce hybrid assemblies to partly compensate the short read length of 454 sequences. Conclusion Our data indicate that 454 pyrosequencing allows rapid and cost-effective sequencing of the gene-containing portions of large and complex genomes and that its combination with ABI-Sanger sequencing and targeted sequence analysis can result in large regions of high-quality finished genomic sequences. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{chromosomes}} to {{move across the}} nuclear space {{is essential for the}} reorganization of the nucleus that takes place in early meiotic prophase. Chromosome dynamics of prophase I have been studied in budding and fission yeasts, but little is known about this process in <b>higher</b> <b>eukaryotes,</b> where <b>genomes</b> and chromosomes are much larger and meiosis takes a longer time to complete. This knowledge gap has been mainly caused by difficulties in culturing isolated live meiocytes of multicellular eukaryotes. To study the nuclear dynamics during meiotic prophase in maize, we established a system to observe live meiocytes inside intact anthers. We found that maize chromosomes exhibited extremely dynamic and complex motility in zygonema and pachynema. The movement patterns differed dramatically between the two stages. Chromosome movements included rotations of the entire chromatin and movements of individual chromosome segments, which were mostly telomere-led. Chromosome motility was coincident with dynamic deformations of the nuclear envelope. Both, chromosome and nuclear envelope motility depended on actin microfilaments as well as tubulin. The complexity of the nuclear movements implies that several different mechanisms affect chromosome motility in early meiotic prophase in maize. We propose that the vigorous nuclear motility provides a mechanism for homologous loci to find each other during zygonema...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBackground: In <b>higher</b> <b>eukaryotes,</b> the <b>genome</b> is {{partitioned}} {{into large}} "Topologically Associating Domains" (TADs) {{in which the}} chromatin displays favoured long-range contacts. While a crumpled/fractal globule organization has received experimental supports at higher-order levels, the organization principles that govern chromatin dynamics within these TADs remain unclear. Using simple polymer models, we previously showed that, in mouse liver cells, gene-rich domains tend to adopt a statistical helix shape when no significant locus-specific interaction takes place. Results: Here, we use data from diverse 3 C-derived methods to explore chromatin dynamics within mouse and Drosophila TADs. In mouse Embryonic Stem Cells (mESC), that possess large TADs (median size of 840 kb), we show that the statistical helix model, but not globule models, is relevant not only in gene-rich TADs, but also in gene-poor and gene-desert TADs. Interestingly, this statistical helix organization is considerably relaxed in mESC compared to liver cells, indicating {{that the impact of}} the constraints responsible for this organization is weaker in pluripotent cells. Finally, depletion of histone H 1 in mESC alters local chromatin flexibility but not the statistical helix organization. In Drosophila, which possesses TADs of smaller sizes (median size of 70 kb), we show that, while chromatin compaction and flexibility are finely tuned according to the epigenetic landscape, chromatin dynamics within TADs is generally compatible with an unconstrained polymer configuration. Conclusions: Models issued from polymer physics can accurately describe the organization principles governing chromatin dynamics in both mouse and Drosophila TADs. However, constraints applied on this dynamics within mammalian TADs have a peculiar impact resulting in a statistical helix organization...|$|R

The number of protein-coding genes in <b>higher</b> <b>eukaryotes</b> identified by <b>genome</b> projects is lower than was expected, while {{a considerable amount of}} putatively non-coding transcription has been detected. Functional small open reading frames (smORFs) are known to exist in several organisms. However, coding sequence detection methods are biased against detecting such very short open reading frames. Thus, a substantial number of non-canonical coding regions encoding short peptides might await characterization. Results: Using bio-informatics methods, we have searched for smORFs of less than 100 amino acids in the putatively non-coding euchromatic DNA of Drosophila melanogaster, and initially identified nearly 600, 000 of them. We have studied the pattern of conservation of these smORFs as coding entities between D. melanogaster and Drosophila pseudoobscura, their presence in syntenic and in transcribed regions of the genome, and their ratio of conservative versus non-conservative nucleotide changes. For negative controls, we compared the results with those obtained using random short sequences, while a positive control was provided by smORFs validated by proteomics data. Conclusions: The combination of these analyses led us to postulate the existence of at least 401 functiona...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Gene {{duplication}} {{and gene}} loss during {{the evolution of}} eukaryotes have hindered attempts to estimate phylogenies and divergence times of species. Although current methods that identify clusters of orthologous genes in complete genomes have helped to investigate gene function and gene content, {{they have not been}} optimized for evolutionary sequence analyses requiring strict orthology and complete gene matrices. Here we adopt a relatively simple and fast genome comparison approach designed to assemble orthologs for evolutionary analysis. Our approach identifies single-copy genes representing only species divergences (panorthologs) in order to minimize potential errors caused by gene duplication. We apply this approach to complete sets of proteins from published <b>eukaryote</b> <b>genomes</b> specifically for phylogeny and time estimation. Results Despite the conservative criterion used, 753 panorthologs (proteins) were identified for evolutionary analysis with four genomes, resulting in a single alignment of 287, 000 amino acids. With this data set, we estimate that the divergence between deuterostomes and arthropods took place in the Precambrian, approximately 400 million years before the first appearance of animals in the fossil record. Additional analyses were performed with seven, 12, and 15 <b>eukaryote</b> <b>genomes</b> resulting in similar divergence time estimates and phylogenies. Conclusion Our results with available <b>eukaryote</b> <b>genomes</b> agree with previous results using conventional methods of sequence data assembly from genomes.

40|$|Graduation date: 2005 This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} cloning and {{characterization of the}} TOUSLEDlike kinases genes of maize (ZmTLKs). The TOUSLED-like kinases (TLKs) are a conserved family of nuclear Ser/Thr kinases in <b>higher</b> <b>eukaryotes.</b> The maize <b>genome</b> has three TOUSLED-like kinase genes (ZmTLK 1, ZmTLK 2, and ZmTLK 3). Based upon sequence similarity, the ZmTLKs are divided into two classes, the ZmTLK 1 and the ZmTLK 2 / 3 class. The origins of these genes can be inferred from their map positions and relationships with TLKs in other Zea species. The ZmTLK 1 and ZmTLK 2 genes occupy syntenous positions on chromosome arms 1 L and 5 S in the maize genome. There are two equivalent classes of TLK genes in other Zea species, altogether indicating that the two ZmTLK classes are orthologous genes from the precursor species of maize, an ancient allotetraploid. Gene expression studies of ZmTLKs {{show that there is}} a higher level of expression in tissues undergoing DNA synthesis. This is consistent with studies of TLKs in animal systems that show involvement in chromatin assembly/remodeling activities during DNA replication and repair, as well as in transcription. The highest level of gene expression for the ZmTLK 2 / 3 class was observed during development of the endosperm, in a period of massive nuclear endoreduplication. ZmTLK 1 is not upregulated in endoreduplicating endosperm, suggesting functional divergence between the two classes of ZmTLK genes. The function of the ZmTLKs was examined by testing whether maize TLK genes could complement the tousled mutant of Arabidopsis. In Arabidopsis thaliana, recessive mutations in the single copy TOUSLED (TSL) gene cause moderate vegetative and severe floral defects, suggesting that TLKs {{may play a role in}} gene expression modulation through chromatin remodeling.

40|$|Abstract Background Numerous {{cases of}} {{horizontal}} transfers (HTs) {{have been described}} for <b>eukaryote</b> <b>genomes,</b> but in contrast to prokaryote genomes, no whole genome evaluation of HTs has been carried out. This is mainly {{due to a lack}} of parametric methods specially designed to take the intrinsic heterogeneity of <b>eukaryote</b> <b>genomes</b> into account. We applied a simple and tested method based on local variations of genomic signatures to analyze the genome of the pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. Results We detected 189 atypical regions containing 214 genes, accounting for about 1 Mb of DNA sequences. However, the fraction of atypical DNA detected was smaller than the average amount detected in the same conditions in prokaryote genomes (3. 1 % vs 5. 6 %). It appeared that about one third of these regions contained no annotated genes, a proportion far greater than in prokaryote genomes. When analyzing the origin of these HTs by comparing their signatures to a home made database of species signatures, 3 groups of donor species emerged: bacteria (40 %), fungi (25 %), and viruses (22 %). It is to be noticed that though inter-domain exchanges are confirmed, we only put in evidence very few exchanges between eukaryotic kingdoms. Conclusions In conclusion, we demonstrated that HTs are not negligible in <b>eukaryote</b> <b>genomes,</b> bearing in mind that in our stringent conditions this amount is a floor value, though of a lesser extent than in prokaryote genomes.

Secondly, our characterization of the Arabidopsis polyadenylation factors suggested that plant polyadenylation has also evolved to regulate the expression of specific genes by means of APA and therefore the specific biological functions.
