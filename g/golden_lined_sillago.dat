50|$|The <b>golden</b> <b>lined</b> whiting, <b>Sillago</b> analis (also {{known as}} the Tin Can Bay whiting or rough-scale whiting), is a species of inshore marine fish of the smelt whiting family, Sillaginidae that inhabits the coastlines of {{northern}} Australia and lower Papua New Guinea. The <b>golden</b> <b>lined</b> whiting can be more readily distinguished by its colour than other whitings in the genus Sillago, although swim bladder morphology and spine and ray counts are the most precise method of identification. S. analis is an opportunistic predator, taking a variety of crustaceans, polychaetes and molluscs, with a transition of diet seen as the fish mature. One unusual aspect about the species diet is the large amounts of molluscan siphons it takes. The species spawns between January and March, with juvenile fish inhabiting the shallow protected coastal waters. <b>Golden</b> <b>lined</b> whiting is important to fisheries centered on Shark Bay in Western Australia and also in Queensland, although makes up a relatively minor component of the whiting fishery.|$|R

Burles’s <b>golden</b> <b>line</b> is a narrow application of the principles outlined by Bede almost a millennium earlier.|$|R
50|$|Table 3 reveals several {{interesting}} {{tendencies in}} <b>golden</b> <b>line</b> usage {{in the early}} medieval period. The fact that Caelius Sedulius, Aldhelm, and the Hisperica Famina have a pronounced preference for the form has long been noted. Corippus in the sixth century also uses the <b>golden</b> <b>line</b> significantly more than classical authors. Note {{that there is not}} a comparable increase in the silver line: If anything, these authors have fewer silver lines. This trend may be due to the growing fondness for leonine rhymes, which are facilitated by the <b>golden</b> <b>line</b> structure but not by the silver line. Another tendency, seen in Corippus, Sedulius, Aldhelm, and Walther de Speyer, is an extremely large number of <b>golden</b> <b>lines</b> in the beginning of a work, which is not matched in the rest of the work. Many scholars only tallied figures for the <b>golden</b> <b>line</b> at the beginnings of these poems, and therefore can have inflated numbers. In the first 500 lines of Aldhelm’s Carmen de virginitate, for example, there are 42 <b>golden</b> <b>lines</b> and 7 silver lines, yielding percentages of 8.4 and 1.4 respectively; in the last 500 lines (2405-2904) there are only 20 <b>golden</b> <b>lines</b> and 4 silver lines, yielding percentages of 4 and 0.8 respectively—a reduction by half. Corippus’s Ioannis and Sedulius’s Paschale have even more extreme reductions. These skewed percentages may indicate that the <b>golden</b> <b>line</b> is an ideal that is artfully strived for but which cannot be continuously realized over the course of a long epic.|$|R

50|$|As Table 2 shows, in late antiquity {{the use of}} <b>golden</b> <b>lines</b> remains {{within the}} general range found in {{classical}} times. Of particular interest is their use by Claudian. On the average the <b>golden</b> <b>line</b> crops up in every 50 lines of Claudian, but there are considerable differences between works. Table 2 gives his poem with the lowest percentage (On Honorius’s Fourth Consulship) and that with the highest (On Honorius’s Third Consulship).Figurative poetry, {{such as that of}} Publilius Optatianus Porfirius and, in Carolingian times, that of Hrabanus Maurus, rarely uses the <b>golden</b> <b>line.</b> These poets use a variety of hexameters praised by Diomedes—rhopalic verses, echo verses, and reciprocal verses. They use the <b>golden</b> <b>line</b> once or twice. The form is rather elementary compared to their usual pyrotechnic displays.|$|R

However, Despauterius quotes the famous example of the <b>golden</b> <b>line,</b> Eclogue 2.50, as {{a good example of}} the type.

50|$|Another {{possible}} explanation for the diminished use of <b>golden</b> <b>lines</b> within an author’s work (observed already in Virgil; see Table 1) is that, with time, poets may gradually free themselves from the constraints of the form. The <b>golden</b> <b>line</b> may have been taught in the schools as a quick way to elegance, which poets would use with increasing moderation as their experience grew. Two poems that appear to be juvenalia point to this conclusion. The Hisperica Famina is a bizarre text which is apparently from seventh-century Ireland. It seems to be a collection of school compositions on set themes that have been run together. Of its 612 lines, 144—23.53 percent—have the <b>golden</b> <b>line</b> structure. Most of the lines that are not “golden” are merely too short to have more than three words; or, occasionally, they are too long. These extremely short or long lines are {{due to the fact that}} the poem is not written in hexameter. It may be written in some rough stress-based meter, but even that cannot be stated with certainty. But the ideal model that the composers took for their verses appears to have been the <b>golden</b> <b>line.</b> Walther de Speyer composed his poem on the life of St. Christopher in 984 when he was seventeen. The percentage of <b>golden</b> <b>lines</b> is high, but the number of near-misses is enormous. When you read Walther you get the impression that he was programmed in school to write <b>golden</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R

50|$|Table 1 <b>Golden</b> and Silver <b>Lines</b> in Classical PoetryFrom Table 1 we {{see that}} <b>golden</b> and silver <b>lines</b> occur in varying {{frequencies}} throughout the classical period, even within the corpus of a single author. There are no Latin <b>golden</b> or silver <b>lines</b> before Catullus, who uses them in poem 64 to an extent almost unparalleled in classical literature. Lucretius has {{a few examples of}} the form. Horace has about 1 in every 300 lines, as does Virgil’s Aeneid. Virgil’s earlier works have a much higher percentage. Ovid and Lucan use the <b>golden</b> <b>line</b> about once in every 100 lines. The high percentage of <b>golden</b> <b>lines</b> found in the Laus Pisonis and other works of the Neronian period has led some scholars to claim that the form is a mark of Neronian aesthetics. While several scholars have claimed that the <b>golden</b> <b>line</b> is mainly and artfully used to close periods and descriptions, the poems do not seem to bear this out.|$|R

50|$|The {{large number}} of <b>golden</b> <b>lines</b> in poetry from the sixth through ninth centuries could reflect the {{combination}} of several trends, such as the preference for hyperbaton and {{the growing popularity of}} leonine rhymes. The statistics do not (and cannot) prove that the form was ever taught and practiced as a discrete form. Even if the <b>golden</b> <b>line</b> was not a conscious poetic conceit in the classical or medieval period, it might have some utility today as a term of analysis in discussing such poetry. However, the form now appears in canonical English commentaries to authors from Callimachus to Aldhelm and most scholars who refer to the <b>golden</b> <b>line</b> today treat it as an important poetic form of indisputable antiquity.|$|R

50|$|In all {{likelihood}} the <b>golden</b> <b>line</b> {{is a term}} gradually developed by Medieval and Renaissance grammarians, from Bede to Burles, but this indeterminate (and apparently unknown) pedigree does not explain its curious hold on Anglo-American scholarship. Far {{more interesting than the}} appearance of the <b>golden</b> <b>line</b> in ancient and medieval poetry is {{the use of the term}} by these modern critics. Today major works and commentaries on canonical poets in Latin and Greek discuss them in light of the <b>golden</b> <b>line,</b> and occasionally even the silver line: Neil Hopkinson’s Callimachus, William Anderson’s Metamorphoses, Richard Thomas’s Georgics, Alan Cameron’s Claudian, Andy Orchard’s Aldhelm. Most of these critics assume or imply that <b>golden</b> <b>lines</b> were deliberate figures, practiced since Hellenistic times and artfully contrived and composed by the poets in question. This process of scouring the canonical texts for such special verse forms is entirely in the spirit of the ancient lists of Servius, Victorinus, and Diomedes Grammaticus. Thus, in a curious way, the arcane wordplay that fascinated ancient grammarians has—in the English-speaking world, at least—come again to play a role in interpreting and explicating the central works of the classical canon.|$|R
