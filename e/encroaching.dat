However, some maps show SH-74 as concurrent with I-35, I-240, and I-44, thus linking the two sections.|$|E
5|$|Highway 8 {{dates from}} the {{creation}} of the state highway system in 1924. Initially a border-to-border route, it was shortened to its current extent due to <b>encroaching</b> U.S. highways. SH-8 has followed its current route since 1966.|$|E

40|$|Background {{and aims}} Intensive land use {{has led to}} {{degradation}} and abandonment of Portuguese oak woodlands, and subsequent shrub encroachment may have altered the spatial heterogeneity of soil C and N pools. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effects of shrub invasion on soil C and N dynamics in an oak woodland in Southern Portugal. Methods Soil was sampled beneath and outside scattered Quercus suber L. canopies, considering non <b>encroached</b> areas and areas <b>encroached</b> by shrubs (Cistus ladanifer L. or Cistus salviifolius L.). Results The spatial heterogeneity of soil C and N contents was mainly associated with tree presence. Outside tree canopies, the labile C pools were larger (mainly beneath C. ladanifer) and C cycling was faster in <b>encroached</b> areas than in non <b>encroached</b> areas. Net and gross N mineralization and urease and protease activities were also higher in <b>encroached</b> than in non <b>encroached</b> areas; however, the metabolic quotient and the Cmicrobial/Corganic ratio were not significantly affected. Beneath the tree canopy, significant effects of encroachment included a small increase in soil labile C and the enzymatic activity beneath C. ladanifer. Conclusions The results indicate the potential capacity of shrub encroachment to accumulate soil organic C in the long term. The rate of soil C and N turnover promoted by shrub encroachment may depend on the Cistus species present...|$|R

5|$|All rock now {{exposed in}} the area of the park is volcanic, but this has not always been the case. For {{hundreds}} of millions of years, the Lassen region underwent repeated uplifting to form mountains, only to have them worn down and submerged under <b>encroaching</b> seas. During the periods of submersion, sand, mud and limestone were deposited. Occasionally volcanic activity was associated with the mountain building.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, Tech {{students}} took the Wreck to Athens {{for the annual}} football game with UGA. After the game, the Wreck's police escort abandoned the car. The vehicle appeared relatively unprotected and was approached by UGA students attempting to vandalize it. The Tech students responsible for the car's safekeeping frightened the <b>encroaching</b> Bulldog fans away by producing a concealed 9 mm pistol.|$|E

5|$|Much of the {{structural}} material was long ago carried off for reuse in buildings in Cley and Blakeney. The surviving ruins are protected as a scheduled monument and Grade II listed building because of their historical importance, {{but there is no}} active management. The ever-present threat from the <b>encroaching</b> sea is likely to accelerate following a realignment of the Glaven's course through the marshes, and lead to the loss of the ruins.|$|E

Once the oscar establishes a territory, it will vigorously defend it by chasing away other fish.|$|E

5|$|Timberlake's primary {{legacy is}} the journal he kept while {{living with the}} Cherokee. The volume was {{published}} in 1765, likely following Timberlake's death in September of that year. The journal is of importance both as an ethnological study, as it contains detailed descriptions of various facets of Cherokee society, and as a historical account, as it gives insight into Cherokee political decision-making and the tribe's early reactions to the <b>encroaching</b> European colonists.|$|E
5|$|About a {{year after}} the accident, a monument—a large white cross with an {{attached}} nameplate—was erected on the spot of the crash site to commemorate the victims of LANSA flight 502. In 2006, because of <b>encroaching</b> development, the Peruvian owner of the land where the memorial was originally located, under pressure from the U.S. Senator from New York, Charles E. Schumer, the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Consulate General in Peru, agreed to relocate the memorial 150 feet away to protect the site.|$|E
5|$|After this success, he {{was sent}} to Asia Minor, where the Turkish raids on the Byzantine borderlands had become a menace, and where Turkish {{settlers}} had begun <b>encroaching</b> upon imperial territory. He remained there until 1267 and achieved some success, securing the lands around the valley of the Maeander River and restoring the defences of the region. The historian George Pachymeres certainly praised his conduct of these operations, and alleged that the mere mention of his approach caused fear to his enemies.|$|E

5|$|At {{the close}} of the Seven Years' War, Euro-American {{settlers}} began trickling into east Tennessee from the eastern colonies. In 1772, several pioneers negotiated a lease for Cherokee lands in northeast Tennessee and formed the Watauga Settlement. In spite of the agreement, tensions between the pioneers and the Cherokee rose steadily. By the outbreak of the American Revolution, the Cherokee were allied with the British against the rebellious American colonies, hoping to push the <b>encroaching</b> settlers out of their territory.|$|E
5|$|Blacknose {{sharks are}} preyed upon by larger sharks, and captives have been {{observed}} to perform an apparent threat display towards <b>encroaching</b> divers or newly introduced members of their species. The display consists of the shark hunching its back, lowering its pectoral fins, gaping its jaws, and swimming with an exaggerated side-to-side motion. Known parasites of this species include the copepods Nesippus orientalis, Perissopus dentatus, Pandarus sinuatus, Kroyeria sphyrnae, Nemesis atlantica, and Eudactylina spinifera, as well as tapeworms in the genera Paraorygmatobothrium and Platybothrium.|$|E
5|$|Desert {{conditions}} returned briefly, {{creating the}} White Throne member, but <b>encroaching</b> seas again beveled the coastline, forming a regional unconformity. Thin beds of clay and silt {{mark the end}} of this formation. The most prominent outcrops of this formation make up the capstone of West Temple in Zion Canyon. Rain dissolves some of the iron oxide and thus streaks Zion's cliffs red (the red streak seen on the Altar of Sacrifice is a famous example). Temple Cap iron oxide is also the source of the red-orange color of much {{the lower half of the}} Navajo Formation.|$|E

40|$|Woody plant {{encroachment}} in savannas may alter carbon (C) {{and nitrogen}} (N) pools over the long-term, {{which could have}} regional or global biogeochemical implications given the widespread encroachment observed in the vast savanna biome. Soil and litter %C and %N were surveyed across four soil types in two <b>encroached,</b> semi-arid savanna landscapes in northern South Africa. Litter at sampling points with a woody component had a higher %N and lower C: N ratio than litter at solely herbaceous points. Severely <b>encroached</b> areas had lower C: N ratios throughout the soil profile than less <b>encroached</b> areas. Soil %C and %N were highly influenced by soil texture but were also influenced {{by the presence of}} a woody overstorey, which increased surface soil %C on three soil types but decreased it on the most heavily <b>encroached</b> soil type. Soil C sequestration may initially increase with bush encroachment but then decline if bush densities become so high as to inhibit understorey grass growth. Key words...|$|R
