500|$|Peter Applebome, {{an editor}} of The New York Times, wrote in 2003 of his {{experience}} as an adult participating with his son in Scouting activities, [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>lucky</b> to have had this unexpected vehicle to share my son's youth, to shape it, and to be shaped by it as well." [...] He concluded that, although Scouting is viewed by some as old-fashioned, [...] "Scouting's core values...are wonderful building blocks for a movement and a life. Scouting's genuinely egalitarian goals and instincts are more important now than they've ever been. It's {{one of the only}} things that kids do that's genuinely cooperative, not competitive." ...|$|E

It's a dizzying, nonchronological spin through the Madonna years, years {{it makes you}} <b>feel</b> <b>lucky</b> to be living through. Her hitmaking genius is {{unmatched}} and [...] undiminished." [...] However, Sheffield called the omission of [...] "Angel" [...] "just plain crazypants." [...] Lean Greenblatt from Entertainment Weekly commented that the album [...] "holds up surprisingly well". Joey Guerra from Houston Chronicle praised the album saying [...] "every song on Celebration defines a moment in time, a radio sing-along, a twirl under the glitterball. It's a pulsing testament to Madonna's often-overlooked pop prowess, from the scrappy electro beginnings of 'Everybody' and 'Burning Up' to the retro-disco swirl of 'Beautiful Stranger' and 'Hung Up', still a hands-in-the-air highlight." ...|$|E

[...] After the race, her [...] connections announced that she would train with the goal of running in the Breeders' Cup Classic.

500|$|Upon {{joining the}} cast of Tangled, Moore was {{initially}} unaware that the film was slated to be Walt Disney Animation Studios' 50th animated feature film. Since that time, she has received her ignorance with gratitude, explaining, [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>lucky</b> because I would've probably felt a bit more pressure had I known going into the recording process." [...] Moore hardly worked with co-stars Zachary Levi and Donna Murphy, who provided the voices of Flynn Rider and Mother Gothel, respectively, never meeting Murphy and having only met Levi once to record their characters' duet [...] "I See the Light". Moore {{was surprised to learn}} that she would be isolated from her co-stars against initial expectations that [...] "we're all going to be chummy, hanging out at the studio laughing and going out to dinner together". Moore had little idea of what her character looked like because, in terms of visual aid, she was only provided with rough, incomplete sketches and storyboards, while [...] "everything else had to be explained" [...] by Howard and Greno.

500|$|Sandy George from Australian Screen Online {{said that}} Vidler's long {{career as an}} actor helped him [...] "draw the terrific performances" [...] from the film's young actors. 17-year-old Laurence Breuls was {{literally}} {{the first person to}} audition for the role of Jared. Hundred of others auditioned though Breuls remained the favourite choice. Vidler chose Simon Lyndon, who played the role of Jared in the original stage production of Blackrock, for the role of Ricko, stating that Lyndon had the looks, charisma, and complexity to play the role. Rebecca Smart, who also portrayed Cherie in the original stage production, was the only person to reprise their role from the play. Blackrock is often considered to be Heath Ledger's debut film, but he had an uncredited minor role in the 1991 film Clowning Around. While Ledger's role in Blackrock is small, it is credited with garnering him attention in Australia, leading to more prominent acting roles. 15-year-old Bojana Novakovic was given the role of Tracy partly because she was a competitive gymnast and was considered mentally and physically strong enough to film the rape scene. Vidler discussed the role with her parents before filming commenced, who despite initial reservations, eventually gave permission for her to film the scene. Novakovic said the experience was traumatic and she began to tremble uncontrollably once the shoot ended, though recovered shortly afterwards, concluding, [...] "In a way, I <b>feel</b> <b>lucky</b> to have had such a role at the beginning of my career. I don't think I'll ever be scared by an emotional scene again." [...] The boys involved in the scene showed up at her door the following day and gave her a bunch of flowers and a T-shirt that said [...] "shit happens". Vidler said he found the performance so powerful that when he first watched the rushes of the scene alone, he burst into tears.|$|E

Here it was that--as well as on whatever other scraps of occasions they could manage--Nan began to take off and fold up and put away in her pocket her pretty, dotty, becoming veil; as under the logic of his having so tremendously ceased, in the shake of his dark storm-gust, to be engaged to another woman. Her removal of that obstacle to a trusted friend's assuring himself whether the peachlike bloom' of her finer facial curves bore the test of such further inquiry into their cool sweetness as might reinforce a mere baffled gaze--her momentous, complete surrender of so much of her charm, let us say, both marked the change in the situation of the pair and established the record of their perfect observance of every propriety for so long before.
