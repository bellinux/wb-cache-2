Lotus was released on November 13, 2012 by RCA Records, but was leaked online on November 5.|$|E

The video begins with many apparently nude Björks singing. Throughout the video, red threads emerge from <b>her</b> <b>nipples</b> and circulate between her breasts and nose, finally enveloping her in a cocoon.

Jennifer has said that her own unexpected conception and birth defects were the basis for the film's themes. The film's tone was also shaped by Lynch's time living in a troubled neighborhood in Philadelphia. Lynch and his family spent five years living in an atmosphere of [...] "violence, hate and filth".

500|$|In {{the early}} hours of January 15, 1978—one week after his arrival in Tallahassee—Bundy entered FSU's Chi Omega {{sorority}} house through a rear door with a faulty locking mechanism. Beginning at about 2:45a.m. he bludgeoned Margaret Bowman, 21, with a piece of oak firewood as she slept, then garroted her with a nylon stocking. He then entered the bedroom of 20-year-old Lisa Levy and beat her unconscious, strangled her, tore one of <b>her</b> <b>nipples,</b> bit deeply into her left buttock, and sexually assaulted her with a hair mist bottle. In an adjoining bedroom he attacked Kathy Kleiner, breaking her jaw and deeply lacerating her shoulder; and Karen Chandler, who suffered a concussion, broken jaw, loss of teeth, and a crushed finger. Tallahassee detectives later determined that the four attacks took place in a total of less than 15 minutes, within earshot of more than 30 witnesses who heard nothing. After leaving the sorority house Bundy broke into a basement apartment eight blocks away and attacked FSU student Cheryl Thomas, dislocating her shoulder and fracturing her jaw and skull in five places. She was left with permanent deafness, and equilibrium damage that ended her dance career. On Thomas's bed police found a semen stain and a pantyhose [...] "mask" [...] containing two hairs [...] "similar to Bundy's in class and characteristic".|$|E

5000|$|In 2015 Moore {{sponsored}} {{a bill that}} would make it a misdemeanor for women to expose their nipples in the state. It is currently legal in New Hampshire for both genders to be topless in public. The proposed bill makes it a punishable crime for a woman to show <b>her</b> <b>nipple,</b> and it classifies such an act as [...] "lewdness" [...] and [...] "indecent exposure." [...] State Rep. Amanda Bouldin (D) wrote an open Facebook message to Moore, saying that he should scrap the bill or at least exempt new mothers who are breastfeeding. (The bill does have such an exemption.) In his response Moore wrote: [...] "If it's a woman's natural inclination to pull <b>her</b> <b>nipple</b> out in public and you support that," [...] Moore wrote, [...] "than sic you should have no problem with a mans sic inclantion sic to stare at it and grab it.

500|$|The video {{opens with}} a {{motorcycle}} gang cruising down a freeway, wearing studded leather jackets. The motorcycle gang are the Twelve Apostles who followed Jesus, including Judas. Gaga as Mary Magdalene clutches onto a Jesus-like figure (Rick Gonzalez) who wears a golden crown of thorns. Among the riders is Judas (Norman Reedus), who crosses Gaga's bike as she looks meaningfully towards him. The gang passes under a flyover, when the song starts. They reach their rustic hideout called [...] "Electric Chapel" [...] where Gaga dances wearing a red sarong and a bikini top with crosses covering <b>her</b> <b>nipples.</b> Gaga's character watches curiously as the wily Judas enters the biker club and immediately gets involved in a brawl. While trying to protect Jesus from the fights she attempts to warn him about his apostle's impending betrayal, but becomes hypnotized by Judas' allure. The storyline is interspersed with choreographed dance sequences and close-ups of Gaga with stark imagery, including artistic eye make-up, which was compared to the Egyptian Eye of Horus. Her flowing blonde hair is accented by a red bandana, blue leather top and puffy white dress {{in different parts of}} the clip. The blue top worn by Gaga displays the [...] "Sacred Heart", a depiction of what Jesus is said to have revealed as a symbol of his love for humanity. During the second verses, Gaga points towards Peter during the line [...] "Build a house", and towards herself during [...] "Or sink a dead body".|$|E
500|$|Mother's Milk {{features}} {{a black and}} white photograph of the band sprawled across the arms of a proportionately larger naked woman. A rose conceals one of <b>her</b> <b>nipples</b> while Kiedis' standing body conceals the other. There were originally two women whose photographs were planned to be used, one being Kiedis' girlfriend Ione Skye and the other being model Dawn Alane; the latter was ultimately chosen. Controversy arose, however, when Dawn claimed the band did not notify her that she was the one chosen to be on the cover of Mother's Milk. Furthermore, several national chains refused to sell the record because they believed the female subject displayed too much nudity. A more strictly censored version was manufactured for some retailers that featured the band members in far larger proportion than the original. The cover of the record was influenced by a promotional poster Kiedis had from the 1960s of Sly and the Family Stone, in which frontman Sly Stone held a miniaturized band in his palm. When Kiedis was finding shots of the band to use on the cover, Frusciante initially refused every photograph the vocalist showed him but settled on one of him sitting down laughing. Mother's Milk was affixed with an [...] "explicit language" [...] warning sticker that, according to Kiedis, [...] "oesn't bother me. Our lyrics are very explicit, whether it's about sex or friendship or love for life in general." [...] The cover booklet of the record {{features a}} painting by Hillel Slovak. Following the album's release, a limited number of promotional posters were issued with the model's breasts exposed. Dawn had no knowledge of the pressing and sued the band, winning a $50,000 settlement.|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Objection (Tango)" [...] {{was directed by}} Dave Meyers and choreographed by Tina Landon. It begins with Shakira and her love interest doing tango in a bar-like setting, starting with a low paced routine. The tango becomes faster and more intricate as the opening beat of the song kicks in. Shakira's love interest exits the bar abruptly, leaving her alone to dance to the song. She follows the man in a yellow car and arrives at a club where she sees him with another woman, played by Hawaiian actress Tabitha Taylor. An animated cartoon-styled sequence follows as Shakira jumps over the crowd and fights her unfaithful lover and Taylor. While wrestling the latter, Shakira pinches both of <b>her</b> <b>nipples</b> and her breasts are shown to reduce in size as the line [...] "Next to her cheap silicon I look minimal" [...] plays. After Shakira defeats the man, the animated sequence ends and the fight is shown to happen only in Shakira's imagination. When she tries to fight the man and Taylor in reality, she is quickly defeated and crashes into a glass table. Two men resembling comical superheroes, {{one of whom is}} played by Dan Southworth, appear to her aid and quickly defeat the man, while Shakira defeats Taylor. The two are shown gagged up in the boot of Shakira's car and are then tied up on spinning discs. The discs rotate faster and faster until they come off and are sent flying off at a high speed. Scenes of Shakira dancing at the bar and performing the song with a band are interspersed throughout the video. The music video reached number one on the Total Request Live chart.|$|E

60|$|That {{which gave}} me most uneasiness among these maids of honour (when my nurse carried me to visit then) was, {{to see them}} use me without any manner of ceremony, like a {{creature}} who had no sort of consequence: for they would strip themselves to the skin, and put on their smocks in my presence, while I was placed on their toilet, directly before their naked bodies, which I am sure to me was very {{far from being a}} tempting sight, or from giving me any other emotions than those of horror and disgust: their skins appeared so coarse and uneven, so variously coloured, when I saw them near, with a mole here and there as broad as a trencher, and hairs hanging from it thicker than packthreads, to say nothing farther concerning the rest of their persons. Neither did they at all scruple, while I was by, to discharge what they had drank, to the quantity of at least two hogsheads, in a vessel that held above three tuns. The handsomest among these maids of honour, a pleasant, frolicsome girl of sixteen, would sometimes set me astride upon one of <b>her</b> <b>nipples,</b> with many other tricks, wherein the reader will excuse me for not being over particular. But I was so much displeased, that I entreated Glumdalclitch to contrive some excuse for not seeing that young lady any more.|$|E
