25|$|A {{number of}} fusion {{researchers}} working on non-tokamak systems, such as Robert Bussard and Eric Lerner, {{have been critical}} of ITER for diverting funding <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> believe could be a potentially more viable and/or cost-effective path to fusion power, such as the polywell reactor.|$|E

Bin Laden issued a fatwa (binding religious edict), which {{amounted to a}} public declaration of war against the US and its allies, and began to refocus al-Qaeda's resources on large-scale, propagandist strikes.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} a {{prediction}} of quantum electrodynamics which has been verified experimentally is the Lamb shift. This refers to an effect whereby the quantum nature of the electromagnetic field causes the energy levels in an atom or ion to deviate slightly <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> would otherwise be. As a result, spectral lines may shift or split.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, Century Telephone Enterprises {{acquired}} Universal Telephone, Inc. for US$90 {{million in}} cash. During the late 1980s {{the company began}} a long trend in which it performed extremely well. The stock split three-for-two twice in this period, as earnings steadily grew, through the 1990-1991 recession, and by year-end 1991, they reached nearly US$40 million, double <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> had been in 1987.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the term}} Germanic has a {{linguistic}} definition today, Roman authors such as Caesar and Tacitus did not clearly divide the Celts <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> called the Germans based on languages. On the contrary, both authors tended to emphasize, partly for political reasons, {{the differences in}} terms of the levels of civilization which had been attained, with Germanic peoples being wilder and less civilized peoples, requiring military and political considerations.|$|E

25|$|The {{entrance}} {{of a new}} life means changing and adapting. Beginning freshmen enter a new phase that affects the way they eat. They are unaware of their nutrition and they only want something <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> see. High school {{is very different from}} what college is. Students transition from being in small classroom into big lecture rooms. The same goes for food, they transition from being served in cafeterias to buffet styles in college. Dining centers excite new students because this is a new experience, therefore they grab more than what they should. It’s something new and it’s what they’re paying for.|$|E
25|$|After the 1996 crisis, the Turkish and Greek {{governments have}} made various claims that certain {{diplomatic}} exchanges between Turkey and Italy after 1932, and between Turkey and Greece after 1947, provided {{proof that the}} respective opponents at that time held legal opinions different <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> claim today, making their present stance inconsistent and untenable. Thus, Turkey has claimed that both the Italian government during the 1930s and the Greek government between 1947 and the 1950s had shown itself to be well aware that the 1932 protocol did not provide legal grounds for an exact delimitation of the boundary.|$|E
25|$|Askeladd's company finds {{employment}} as mercenaries in the Danish invasion of London. There they face {{off with a}} larger force led by Thorkell the Tall, a fellow Viking. Thorfinn and Thorkell meet in battle, and Askeladd's band flees <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> see as an unwinnable fight. The two forces meet again later, however, when both commanders seek to capture the young Danish Prince Canute. Askeladd succeeds in capturing the prince, but is forced once again to flee from Thorkell's larger army. The company takes refuge for the winter in the frozen north of England near the Danish encampment at Gainsborough.|$|E

25|$|It is usual to {{say that}} Mill is {{committing}} a number of fallacies. He is accused of committing the naturalistic fallacy, because {{he is trying to}} deduce what people ought to do <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> in fact do; the fallacy of equivocation, because he moves from the fact that (1) something is desirable, i.e. is capable of being desired, to the claim that (2) it is desirable, i.e. that it ought to be desired; and the fallacy of composition, because the fact that people desire their own happiness does not imply that the aggregate of all persons will desire the general happiness.|$|E
25|$|Better America Federation (BAF), a {{group whose}} {{goal was to}} clear the State of California <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> deemed to be {{dangerous}} dissent, targeted the Pioneer Summer Camp (PSC) {{in the summer of}} 1929. The youth camp for working-class children was maintained by a number of different groups and organizations, some of which were either openly Communist or had expressed sympathy for the Communist Party's goals. California had a state law, enacted in 1919, that prohibited public display of a red flag. The BAF persuaded a local sheriff to search the Pioneer Summer Camp. The resultant search turned up a red flag; the sheriff then arrested Yetta Stromberg, a summer teacher at the camp, along with several other employees.|$|E
25|$|In 1919 Comín {{took part}} in works of the grand Jaimista reunion named Junta Magna de Biarritz, an {{assembly}} intended to provide the movement with a new momentum following the Mellista breakup. Though the gathering was massively attended, his taking part demonstrated Comín's growing position in the party ranks. In 1920 he tried his hand when running for the Cortes from the South Aragonese district of Daroca, presenting his bid as a Jaimist and Agrarian candidate. He lost to a conservative rival and appealed, accusing his counter-candidate with corruption; the charge was dismissed. He did not {{take part in the}} last electoral campaign of Restauración in 1923, as the Jaimistas agreed they would abstain <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> considered corrupt democracy.|$|E

25|$|The Caribbean {{islands and}} early Spanish explorations around the circum-Caribbean region {{had not been}} of major political, strategic, or {{financial}} importance until the conquest of the Aztec Empire in 1521. However, important precedents of exploration, conquest, and settlement and crown rule had been initially worked out in the Caribbean, which long affected subsequent regions, including Mexico and Peru. The indigenous societies of Mesoamerica brought under Spanish control were of unprecedented complexity and wealth <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> had encountered in the Caribbean. This presented both an important opportunity and a potential threat {{to the power of}} the Crown of Castile, since the conquerors were acting independent of effective crown control. The societies could provide the conquistadors, especially Hernán Cortés, a base from which the conquerors could become autonomous, or even independent, of the Crown.|$|E
25|$|When {{determining}} if {{an outcome}} has been achieved, assessments may become too mechanical, looking {{only to see}} if the student has acquired the knowledge. The ability to use and apply the knowledge in different ways may not be the focus of the assessment. The focus on determining if the outcome has been achieved leads to a loss of understanding and learning for students, who may never be shown how to use the knowledge they have gained. Instructors are faced with a challenge: they must learn to manage an environment that can become fundamentally different <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are accustomed to. In regards to giving assessments, they must be willing to put in the time required to create a valid, reliable assessment that ideally would allow students to demonstrate their understanding of the information, while remaining objective.|$|E
25|$|As {{one of the}} two detectives in the nation's only {{full-time}} unit {{devoted to}} that specialty, she had gained some local media attention when she and her partner had recovered a statue stolen from Carthay Circle. To better understand the field, she told a local newspaper, she had begun learning to paint. Off the job, she had been active in the Los Angeles Women Police Officers Association and organized childcare for families of officers. She also made chocolate-covered cherries and homemade soap for her neighbors in Simi Valley for Christmas. Since she was still with the department, they realized they would have to proceed carefully. Still, they ranked Lazarus as the least promising of the five suspects, since <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> read in the files Lazarus and Ruetten had ended any relationship they had had over the summer before the murder.|$|E
