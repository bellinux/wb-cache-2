25|$|Alfalfa can be sown {{in spring}} or fall, and does best on well-drained soils with a neutral pH of 6.8 – 7.5. Alfalfa {{requires}} sustained levels of potassium and phosphorus to grow well. It is moderately sensitive to salt levels {{in both the}} soil and irrigation water, although {{it continues to be}} grown in the arid southwestern United States, where salinity is an <b>emerging</b> <b>issue.</b> Soils low in fertility should be fertilized with manure or a chemical fertilizer, but correction of pH is particularly important. Usually a seeding rate of 13 – 20kg/hectare (12 – 25lb/acre) is recommended, with differences based upon region, soil type, and seeding method. A nurse crop is sometimes used, particularly for spring plantings, to reduce weed problems and soil erosion, but can lead to competition for light, water, and nutrients.|$|E

50|$|The major <b>emerging</b> <b>issue</b> of the {{campaign}} was the Ku Klux Klan, which had surged in popularity across {{the state in the}} early 1920s. Long was reluctant to address the issue; his political support was strongest in Protestant north Louisiana, the heartland of the Klan. A strong condemnation of the Klan would alienate many of these supporters. Long ducked this issue, instead arguing that Standard Oil and corporate domination was the true threat to Louisiana. Long was not affiliated with the Klan, but his defensiveness cast doubts among some voters. Fuqua favored an antimasking law to combat the Klan, but did not take a strong stance on the issue. Bouanchaud, a Catholic, made a strong denunciation of the Klan his main campaign issue.|$|E
