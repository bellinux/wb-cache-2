Unlike other cultures, lunch is the primary course and breakfast and dinner are lighter in contents.|$|E

In the United States, the view that has generally prevailed is that firing for any cause in general renders a former employee ineligible for unemployment compensation, but that {{this is no longer}} the case if the 'cause' is religious in nature, especially an employee's unwillingness to work during Jewish Shabbat, Christian Sabbath, or Muslim jumu'ah.|$|E

500|$|When Barton first {{arrives at}} the Hotel Earle, he is asked by the {{friendly}} bellhop Chet (Steve Buscemi) if he is [...] "a trans or a res"– [...] transient or resident. Barton explains that he isn't sure but will be staying [...] "indefinitely". The dichotomy between permanent inhabitants and guests reappears several times, notably in the hotel's motto, [...] "A <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> lifetime", which Barton notices on the room's stationery. This idea returns {{at the end of}} the movie, when Charlie describes Barton as [...] "a tourist with a typewriter". His ability to leave the Earle (while Charlie remains) is presented by critic Erica Rowell as evidence that Barton's story represents the process of writing itself. Barton, she says, represents an author who is able to leave a story, while characters like Charlie cannot.|$|E
500|$|Prisoners {{felt their}} {{complaints}} about conditions were being ignored. Remand prisoners were only allowed {{out of their}} cells for 18hours per week, and Category A prisoners were locked in their cells for 22hours a day, and rarely left their cells except for [...] "slopping out", a one-hour exercise period each <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> weekly shower. In March 1990, Dominic Noonan was transferred from Strangeways to HM Prison Hull. Noonan was the organiser of the Prisoners' League Association (PLA), an organisation formed in 1989 which campaigned for prisoners' rights. Its aims included initiating legal proceedings against prison staff for mistreatment of prisoners, and picketing outside prisons in which prisoners were mistreated. The PLA were active at Strangeways Prison, and Noonan's transfer demonstrates prison officers were aware of rising tensions inside the prison. On 26 March, Barry Morton {{was taken to the}} [...] "punishment block" [...] and strip-searched after being visited by his mother, as prison officers believed she had brought drugs into the prison for him. During a struggle he sustained a black eye and swollen nose, and the following day he was released back into the main prison along with another prisoner, Tony Bush. Later the same day, Bush and Morton climbed onto the roof of the prison and staged a twenty-hour rooftop protest. On 31 March there was a 30-minute sit-down protest in the chapel after a film was shown, which ended after a prison officer promised to listen to the prisoners' grievances. The same evening it is reported that a black prisoner was assaulted by prison officers in front of other prisoners, and injected with Largactil [...] a sedative used to control prisoners, known in prisons as the [...] "liquid cosh". Prisoners then decided to stage a further protest in the chapel the following day, 1 April.|$|E

2500|$|Young Earth creationists {{generally}} hold that, when Genesis {{describes the}} creation of the Earth occurring over a period of days, this indicates normal-length 24 hour days, and cannot reasonably be interpreted otherwise. They agree that the Hebrew word for [...] "day" [...] (yôm) can refer to either a 24-hour <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> long or unspecified time; but argue that, whenever the latter interpretation is used, it includes a preposition defining the long or unspecified period. In the specific context of Genesis 1, since the days are both numbered and are referred to as [...] "evening and morning", this can mean only normal-length days. Further, they argue that the 24-hour day is the only interpretation that makes sense of the Sabbath command in Exodus 20:8–11. YECs argue that it is a glaring exegetical fallacy to take a meaning from one context (yom referring to {{a long period of time}} in Genesis 1) and apply it to a completely different one (yom referring to normal-length days in Exodus 20).|$|E
