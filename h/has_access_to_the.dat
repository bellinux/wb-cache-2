5|$|After {{crossing}} the North Branch Metedeconk River, I-195 continues into Howell Township, Monmouth County and turns northeast, reaching a cloverleaf interchange with US 9. At this point, the road turns east again and soon heads back into dense woods, passing over Conrail Shared Assets Operations' Southern Secondary railroad line. After {{crossing the}} Manasquan River, the expressway interchanges with CR 547, which {{provides access to}} CR 524 and CR 549. Shortly after CR 547, I-195 enters Wall Township and passes through Allaire State Park. The eastern end of I-195 is located at Exit 35, its junction with Route 34 that <b>has</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southbound Garden State Parkway from the eastbound direction. At the exit for Route 34, I-195 ends and Route 138 begins, but the highway and exit numbering continue onto Route 138, marking the interchange with the Garden State Parkway as Exit 36. Past this interchange, Route 138 continues east to Belmar on the Jersey Shore as an arterial boulevard, making connections with Route 18 and Route 35.|$|E

5|$|I-280 {{continues}} to run {{just north of}} the railroad as a six-lane freeway through Harrison, reaching an interchange with CR 508. The road continues southeast through urban surroundings before turning east and passing to the north of a railroad yard, splitting from the railroad line as it runs into Kearny and enters the New Jersey Meadowlands. At the final interchange with CR 508, I-280 <b>has</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Holland Tunnel via Route 7, US 1/9 Truck and Route 139. Past CR 508, the freeway narrows to four lanes and comes to the toll plaza for the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95) at exit 15W, at which point I-280 ends. Full access is provided with the Western Spur of the New Jersey Turnpike, which carries through I-95 traffic; ramps to and from the north on the Eastern Spur of the New Jersey Turnpike allow for access to the Lincoln Tunnel via Route 495.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the belief that}} an extraterrestrial civilization would want to establish an empire, Ćirković proposes that an extraterrestrial civilization would maintain equilibrium rather than expand outward. In such an equilibrium, a civilization would only colonize a small number of stars, aiming to maximize efficiency rather than to expand massive and unsustainable imperial structures. This contrasts with the classic Kardashev Type III civilization, which <b>has</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> energy output of an entire galaxy and is not subject to any limits on its future expansion. According to this view, advanced civilizations may not resemble the classic examples in science fiction, but might more closely reflect the small, independent Greek city-states, with an emphasis on cultural rather than territorial growth.|$|E
5|$|The Cross-Westchester Expressway, {{which is}} {{maintained}} by the New York State Thruway Authority, is six lanes wide and carries I-287 east to a westbound exit for NY119 that is intertwined with the ramps between the New York State Thruway and NY119/Saw Mill River Parkway. After passing over the Saw Mill River Parkway and the Saw Mill River, the road enters the Village of Elmsford and runs through developed areas as it has a partial diamond interchange with NY9A {{that does not have}} an eastbound exit. The Cross-Westchester Expressway turns southeast from this point and intersects the Sprain Brook Parkway. I-287 widens to eight lanes at this junction and continues to the exit for NY100A. After the NY100A interchange, the freeway leaves Elmsford and turns to the east near residential areas, narrowing to six lanes before coming to an exit for NY100 and NY119 that also <b>has</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Bronx River Parkway.|$|E

The gameplay was adjusted to allow the player the option to quickly play through the game's story, but head director Toshihiko Kujioka also wanted to add in gameplay elements that would add another layer of challenge. The story is told {{from the perspective of}} Ai Hidaka, Eri Mizutani and Ryō Akizuki—three prospective pop idols introduced in Dearly Stars as they enter the talent agency 876 Production, and deals with their training on their way to stardom. The player <b>has</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> three idols' different scenarios when playing, and each one involves a branching plot line.|$|E
5|$|Xbox One {{games are}} {{distributed}} at retail on Blu-ray Disc, and digitally as downloads through Xbox Games Store. All Xbox One games must be installed to the console's storage: users {{can begin to}} play portions of a game (such as opening levels) once the installation or download reaches a specific point, while {{the remainder of the}} game is downloaded or installed in the background. Updates to games and system software are also downloaded in the background and while in standby. If the game is installed from physical media, the disc is still required for validation purposes. If the game is installed on another console, and that console owner no longer <b>has</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> disc, the owner has the option of unlocking the install on their hard drive by purchasing it through Xbox Live; the installed game then acts as a game installed on the hard drive. An active internet connection may be required for some games, particularly those that rely on server-side processing..|$|E
5|$|In the 1927 New Jersey {{state highway}} renumbering, Route 17N {{received}} the Route 2 designation, and was defined {{to run from}} Route 7 in North Arlington to the New York border near Suffern, New York. By 1937, the whole old road north of Rutherford was bypassed by a new four-lane divided highway {{with the exception of}} the 1927 bridge over the Saddle River in Ridgewood, north of the Paramus Road interchange. This old alignment joins at Paramus Road and leaves just north of the bridge at Franklin Turnpike, which only <b>has</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southbound lanes through a RIRO intersection. A short-lived spur of Route 2, Route 2N, was defined in 1938 to run from Route 2 (Ridge Road) in Lyndhurst west along Kingsland Avenue and over the Passaic River on the Park Avenue Bridge into Nutley, where it would end at Union Avenue (west of Route 7). In 1930, New York had renumbered its state routes; the extension of Route 2 north and west into New York had remained New York State Route 17. New Jersey had not assigned a Route 17 in the 1927 renumbering, and so in March 1942, Route 2 was numbered Route 17 to match and provide a single number for military caravans during World War II.|$|E

5|$|The {{concurrent}} US 9 and Route 35 head northwest on a four-lane {{divided highway}} through commercial areas and woodland, crossing over a Conrail Shared Assets Operations before turning north and interchanging with Raritan Street and Kearney Road, crossing back into Sayreville at the interchange with the former. At this point, the road widens to six lanes. The two routes split at an interchange (the former Victory Circle) that <b>has</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> southbound Garden State Parkway {{and from the}} northbound Parkway by way of Chevalier Avenue. From here, US 9 closely parallels {{the east side of}} the Garden State Parkway as it crosses the Raritan River on the Edison Bridge, with the parkway crossing the river on the Driscoll Bridge. Upon crossing the Raritan River, US 9 enters Woodbridge Township, where it reaches a complex interchange with the Garden State Parkway, Route 440, and CR 656. Within this interchange, the Garden State Parkway’s travel lanes run in between the travel lanes of US 9, with this configuration continuing past the interchange for a short distance. Along this stretch, there are ramps to and from CR 616 and to the parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95).|$|E
