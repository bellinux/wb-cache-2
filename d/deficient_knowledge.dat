To administer sacraments in a given location, all priests involved in the Indian ministry would need a license. In this way, Montúfar would be able to replace friars with secular clerics. According to Montúfar, the Indians learned the doctrine of the church as if they were parrots, without understanding its contents. With such a <b>deficient</b> <b>knowledge</b> of the basis of the Christian doctrine and infrequent contact with the sacraments of the Church, Montúfar doubted whether many of the Indians souls would be saved.|$|E

There are words and phrases from the English language, but also non-sense words, and the syntax of proper English is not used systematically. Also, it is not {{possible}} to assign a sensible meaning to the lyrics. This situation arose from the <b>deficient</b> <b>knowledge</b> of English by the singer, Remu Aaltonen. The words were supposed to be replaced later by proper English, and Remu’s words were only meant for a demo recording. However, the other members of the band, as well as the producer, thought that the delivery was strong, and decided to stick to those words, despite opposition from Remu Aaltonen.

5000|$|The human free-will as a {{subjective}} principle has for its objective correlate {{the notion of}} possibility, by which one of two alternatives may occur. This does not cause the divine omniscience to undergo any limitation; unless, misled by common usage, one should designate as [...] "possible" [...] those things whose undetermined state results not from their own essence, but only from our <b>deficient</b> <b>knowledge</b> of the essence. But this kind of possibility, which, indeed, is no possibility at all, must be eliminated from God as quite irreconcilable with His omniscience. In its strict and precise form, the notion of possibility {{is not at all}} antagonistic to the omniscience of God; for it is easily conceivable that God from the beginning regulated creation, so that for certain cases both alternatives should be [...] "possible" [...] events; that the Creator, in order to grant to human liberty the opportunity to display its own energy, left the final issue of certain actions undecided even for His own knowledge (ib. p. 96; German trans., p. 123).|$|E
50|$|With {{the high}} demand of cheap, clean energy sources {{persistently}} increasing, organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices (organic solar cells), {{have been studied}} extensively to help in reducing the dependence on fossil fuel and containing the emission of green house gases (especially CO2, NOx, and SOx). This global demand for solar energy increased 54% in 2010, while the United States alone has installed more than 2.3 GW of solar energy sources in 2010. Some of the attributes which make OPVs such a promising candidate {{to solve this problem}} include their low-cost of production, throughput, ruggedness, and their chemically tunable electric properties along with significant reduction in the production of greenhouse gases. For decades, the researchers have believed that the maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) would most likely remain below 0.1%. Only in 1979 Tang reported a two-layer, thin-film PV device, which ultimately yielded a power conversion efficiency of 1%. Tang’s research was published in 1986, which allowed others to decipher many of the problems which limited the basic understanding of the process involved in the OPVs. In later years, the majority of the research focused on the composite blend of poly(3-hexylthiopehene) (P3HT) and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). This, along with the research performed on fullerenes, dictated the majority of studies pertaining to OPV for many years. In more recent research, polymer-based bulk heterojunction solar cells, along with low band-gap donor-acceptor copolymers have been created for PCBM-based OPV devices. These low band-gap donor-acceptor copolymers are able to absorb a higher percentage of the solar spectrum as compared to other high efficiency polymers. These copolymers have been widely researched due to their ability to be tuned for specific optical and electrical properties.To date, the best OPV devices have a maximum power conversion efficiency of approximately 8.13%. This low power conversion efficiency is directly related to discrepancies in the film morphology on the nano-scale level. Explanations of film morphology include recombination and/or trapping of charges, low open circuit voltages, heterogeneous interfaces, grain boundaries, and phase-separated domains. Many of these problems arise from the <b>deficient</b> <b>knowledge</b> of electro-optical properties on the nano-scale level. In numerous studies, it has been observed that heterogeneities in the electrical and optical properties influence device performance. These heterogeneities which occur in OPVs are a result the manufacturing process, such as annealing time, which is explained below. Research has mainly consisted of discovering exactly how this film morphology affects the device performance.|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of a health education intervention on “breast self-examination ” regarding for knowledge, attitude, and practice among female students. Quasi-experimental study was carried out on 180 female student's sitting in the Faculty of Physical Education at Zagazig University and its affiliated hostel. The data collection tools included a self-administered questionnaire and an observation checklist to assess student’s performance of BSE before and after the intervention. The results showed that these students have <b>deficient</b> <b>knowledge</b> and low perceptions regarding breast cancer and BSE; although the majority had positive attitudes, their practice of BSE is very deficient. The educational intervention was effective in improving students ’ knowledge, perceptions, attitudes, and practice. The intervention was a significant independent positive predictor of student's knowledge and practice scores, while the attitude score is modulated through the knowledge score. In conclusion, the university students at the Faculty of physical Education have <b>deficient</b> <b>knowledge,</b> low perceptions and inadequate practice regarding breast cancer and BSE.

40|$|In every {{manufacturing}} process there are variations from nominal values that cause part- and assembly variation {{which can lead}} to <b>deficient</b> products. <b>Knowledge</b> of this variation and the ability to simulate them are important in developing design concepts. Plastics are predicted to have increased importance in the manufacturing industry. However, {{there is a lack of}} understanding of the variation in the produced plastic parts and how designers should take these variations under consideration. Existing software for simulating plastic parts produced in the injection molding process is not useful for variation simulation because of long running times. In this paper a procedure to simulate part variation using a regression model is presented. This regression model is build and fitted using design of computer experiments. Further, the contributions of process parameters on plastic part variation are analyzed. A case study conducted on a cell phone shell resulted in a regressio n model that was able to give close agreement with the injection molding simulation and thus enabling variation simulation. The process parameters contributing the most to geometrical variation were melt temperature and packing time...|$|R
40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{identify}} situational and cross-situational factors that predict individuals’ issue-specific negative attitudes, and test a new sub-type of individual activism – lacuna individuals. Lacuna individuals are those who hold high levels of negative attitudes about an issue, have <b>deficient</b> issue-specific <b>knowledge,</b> and yet are highly motivated in their information behaviors about the issue. The evaluation and acceptance of scientifically non-legitimate data, referred to as knowledge deficiency, and negative attitudes about the respective issues, form the focal points of the conceptualization of lacuna individuals. In this study, the contexts of homonegativity in India and vaccine safety in the US have been investigated to identify lacuna individuals about them. Characteristics of individuals, their motivated information behaviors and attitudes toward the problems at hand were examined and compared to non-lacuna individuals. Using the Situational Theory of Problem Solving as a theoretical frame, this study advances a model to explain lacuna individuals’ motivated information behaviors. The results of this proposed study contribute to communication theory by furthering our understanding of individual activism about two social issues, especially how knowledge deficiency further exacerbates social problems. ...|$|R

The results presented represent the conceptualisation of spatial values in a sample population (N= 188) taken from four elementary schools. In relation to other research, the principal recognition of spatial values by teenagers is assessed, together with the limited possibilities of this knowledge into their local living environment. Conclusions can be drawn about their <b>deficient</b> <b>knowledge</b> of the cause-and-effect in the relationship in individual processes in both natural and constructed spaces. The reasons for such <b>deficient</b> <b>knowledge</b> on a local, living environment level are predominantly attributed to the influences of their domestic social environment.
