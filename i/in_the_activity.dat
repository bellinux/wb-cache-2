5|$|Abduction of marriage-age {{women was}} common during the Liao dynasty. Khitans men of all social classes participated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>activity,</b> and the abductees were both Khitan and Han. In some cases, {{this was a}} step in the {{courtship}} process, where the woman would agree to the abduction and the resulting sexual intercourse, and then the abductor and abductee would return to the woman's home to announce their intention to marry. This process was known as baimen (拜門). In other cases, the abduction would be non-consensual and would result in a rape.|$|E
5|$|Noted {{hurricane}} expert Dr. William M. Gray on April7 predicted eleven named storms, {{with eight}} reaching hurricane strength {{and three of}} the eight reaching Category3 strength. The prediction issued on June7 was similar, increasing the named storms to twelve, eight hurricanes, and four major hurricanes. On May10, NOAA issued a season outlook, which gave the indication of an above-average season. According to NOAA, the global scale atmospheric circulation pattern which was taking place was conducive to an above-average hurricane season. However, La Niña was present it the Eastern Pacific, which was a factor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> in the season. NOAA issued a 75% chance of above average activity.|$|E
5|$|Clouzot's {{return to}} work {{reassured}} the doctors and insurers and {{he returned to the}} film studio to make his final film La Prisonnière. The film began production in September 1967 and was halted when Clouzot fell ill and was hospitalized until April 1968. He began filming La Prisonnière again in August 1968. Clouzot incorporated stylistic elements of his aborted film L'enfer into La Prisonnière. La Prisonnière is about a woman who is introduced to a photographer who takes masochistic submissive pictures of young women. The woman volunteers herself as a model for these pictures and is surprised at her own pleasure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>activity.</b> After finishing La Prisonnière, Clouzot's health grew worse. In the 1970s, he wrote a few more scripts without ever filming them, including a feature about Indochina. He also planned to direct a pornographic film in 1974 for Francis Micheline, but the film was abandoned. Clouzot's health grew worse and he required open-heart surgery in November 1976. On 12 January 1977 Clouzot died in his apartment while listening to The Damnation of Faust. Clouzot is buried beside Véra in the Montmartre Cemetery.|$|E

5|$|Reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>activity</b> of the {{cholinergic}} neurons is {{a well-known}} feature of Alzheimer's disease. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are employed to reduce {{the rate at which}} acetylcholine (ACh) is broken down, thereby increasing the concentration of ACh in the brain and combating the loss of ACh caused by the death of cholinergic neurons. There is evidence for the efficacy of these medications in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, and some evidence for their use in the advanced stage. Only donepezil is approved for treatment of advanced AD dementia. The use of these drugs in mild cognitive impairment has not shown any effect in a delay of the onset of AD. The most common side effects are nausea and vomiting, both of which are linked to cholinergic excess. These side effects arise in approximately 10–20% of users, are mild to moderate in severity, and can be managed by slowly adjusting medication doses. Less common secondary effects include muscle cramps, decreased heart rate (bradycardia), decreased appetite and weight, and increased gastric acid production.|$|E
