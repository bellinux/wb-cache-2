5|$|It {{has been}} 4 {{days since the}} crash, September 25, 2004. Locke awakens from Oceanic Flight 815's crash and wiggles his toes, realizing that {{he is no longer}} paralyzed. Boars raid the body-filled fuselage, causing Jack to decide it should be burned. The next day, the {{survivors}} discover that their food is exhausted, and wonder what to do. Locke reveals to hold many <b>hunting</b> <b>knives,</b> and suggests to go after the boar in the jungle. On his hunting mission, Locke is accompanied by Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) – who was given by Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) an antenna, which after being set will help triangulate the signal of the French transmission heard two days before – and Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau).|$|E

25|$|At first Faringdon's {{relationship}} with King Henry VIII of England {{seems to have}} been supportive. King Henry was his guest on 30 January 1521, and he later became one of the royal chaplains. Among Henry's New Year gifts in 1532 was £20 in a white leather purse to the Abbot of Reading. When the king was hunting in the neighborhood the abbot would take the opportunity of sending him presents of Kennet trout or <b>hunting</b> <b>knives.</b>|$|E

500|$|In 1901, the U.S. Geological Survey sent Abraham Lincoln Fellows and William Torrence {{into the}} canyon {{to look for a}} site to build a [...] {{diversion}} tunnel bringing water to the Uncompahgre Valley, which was suffering from water shortages due to an influx of settlers into the area. Torrence, a Montrose native and an expert mountaineer, had taken part in a failed expedition the previous year, and his experience proved valuable on his second excursion. He opted to bring a single rubber air mattress instead of the heavy wooden boats that had doomed his previous journey {{into the canyon}}. They entered the canyon on August 12 equipped with [...] "only <b>hunting</b> <b>knives,</b> two silk lifeline ropes, and rubber bags to encase their instruments." [...] After a harrowing 10 days braving rock falls, waterfalls, and 76 river crossings, they emerged from the canyon with a suitable tunnel site.|$|E
500|$|Food was eaten from wooden or pewter trenchers with two-tined forks, large spoons, and <b>hunting</b> <b>knives.</b> Dishware was {{not popular}} {{since it was}} easily {{breakable}} and tended to dull knives quickly. Unlike the Quakers and Puritans, feasting {{with an abundance of}} food and drink was never discouraged and practiced as often as was feasible. Generally, backcountry cuisine did not share the religious austerity of the North nor the refinement of the South and was therefore denigrated by outsiders. An apparent lack of fastidiousness in preparing the food provoked further criticism from many sources. The Anglican Woodmason characterized backcountry cooking as [...] "exceedingly filthy and most execrable". Others told of matrons washing their feet in the cook pot, that it was considered unlucky to wash a milk churn and that human hairs in butter were considered a sign of quality. [...] These descriptions seem to be confirmed by an old saying attributed to Appalachian housewives: [...] "The mair [...] dirt the less hurt". Another expression of backcountry hardiness was the lack of appreciation of coffee and tea. Both were described as mere [...] "slops" [...] and were deemed appropriate only for those who were sick or unfit for labor.|$|E

2500|$|In 2006 {{the only}} hunting weapons allowed for {{reindeer}} harvesting were bolt action, non-automatic rifles, using [...]222 Remington caliber cartridges or larger. A good, large rifle scope is important, as shots at longer distances may be necessary, and visibility may be poor because of snowfall, fog, or limited lighting levels. Folding or fixed-blade <b>hunting</b> <b>knives</b> {{are necessary for}} many purposes. Binoculars with large objective diameter are used to spot prey at great distances, sometimes in waning light.|$|E
60|$|Then {{before any}} of the party could recover, the Indians were upon them, {{shouting}} like demons and flourishing their tomahawks and their keen-edged <b>hunting</b> <b>knives.</b>|$|E

60|$|The hunter {{purchased}} for the lads some silk underwear that was extra warm, and some stout boots, and outer garments of wool and of fur, {{and also some}} oilskins for wet weather. Then he took them to a gun shop in Portland and fitted them out with pistols, repeating rifles, and stout <b>hunting</b> <b>knives.</b> He also {{purchased for}} them water-tight match safes, and colored goggles of the automobile variety--the latter to ward off headache and snow-blindness.|$|E
60|$|Most of {{the thirty}} or so little tables covered by red cloths {{with a white}} design stood ranged {{at right angles to}} the deep brown wainscoting of the {{underground}} hall. Bronze chandeliers with many globes depended from the low, slightly vaulted ceiling, and the fresco paintings ran flat and dull all round the walls without windows, representing scenes of the chase and of outdoor revelry in mediæval costumes. Varlets in green jerkins brandished <b>hunting</b> <b>knives</b> and raised on high tankards of foaming beer.|$|E
60|$|The {{details of}} the defense were quickly arranged, for James Morris had often speculated upon just {{what to do in}} such a {{situation}} as was now at hand. Everything left outside of the palisade was brought in and then the gates were closed, barred, and reenforced by large rocks which lay handy. This accomplished, every gun and pistol in the post was examined, cleaned, and put into perfect order for use, and powder and ball were dealt out liberally. The Indians also looked after their bows and arrows, and <b>hunting</b> <b>knives</b> and tomahawks were not forgotten.|$|E

60|$|We reached our rooms, meeting {{no one in}} the passages, {{and there}} made our preparations. First we changed our festal robes for those warmer {{garments}} in which we had travelled to the city of Kaloon. Then we ate and drank what we could of the victuals which stood in the antechamber, not knowing when we should find more food, and filled two satchels such as these people sling about their shoulders, with the remains of the meat and liquor and a few necessaries. Also we strapped our big <b>hunting</b> <b>knives</b> about our middles and armed ourselves with short spears that were made for the stabbing of game.|$|E
6000|$|With no tablecloth, {{one could}} {{scarcely}} look for napkins, but a towel hung handy, upon which one might wipe his fingers after handling a bone. The dishes {{were far from}} plentiful and mostly of a sort to stand rough usage. Coffee and milk were drunk from bowls with narrow bottoms and wide tops, and sometimes these bowls served also for corn mush and similar dishes. Forks had been introduced and also regular eating knives, but old hunters and trappers like James Morris and Sam Barringford preferred to use their <b>hunting</b> <b>knives</b> with which to cut their food, and Barringford considered a fork rather superfluous and [...] "dandified." ...|$|E
60|$|The present {{party of}} Crows, however, evinced {{nothing of the}} invidious {{character}} {{for which they are}} renowned. During the day and night that they were encamped in company with the travellers, their conduct was friendly in the extreme. They were, in fact, quite irksome in their attentions, and had a caressing manner at times quite importunate. It was not until after separation on the following morning that the captain and his men ascertained the secret of all this loving-kindness. In the course of their fraternal caresses, the Crows had contrived to empty the pockets of their white brothers; to abstract the very buttons from their coats, and, above all, to make free with their <b>hunting</b> <b>knives.</b>|$|E

50|$|Merced County Sheriff Vern Warnke {{stated that}} the weapon used in the attack was a <b>hunting</b> <b>knife</b> between 8 and 10 inches in length.|$|R
60|$|The caravans of {{supplies}} {{arrived at the}} valley just at this period of gallantry and good fellowship. Now commenced a scene of eager competition and wild prodigality at the different encampments. Bales were hastily ripped open, and their motley contents poured forth. A mania for purchasing spread itself throughout the several bands--munitions for war, for hunting, for gallantry, were seized upon with equal avidity--rifles, <b>hunting</b> <b>knives,</b> traps, scarlet cloth, red blankets, garish beads, and glittering trinkets, were bought at any price, and scores run up without any thought how they were ever to be rubbed off. The free trappers, especially, were extravagant in their purchases. For a free mountaineer to pause at a paltry consideration of dollars and cents, in the attainment of any object that might strike his fancy, would stamp him with {{the mark of the}} beast in the estimation of his comrades. For a trader to refuse one of these free and flourishing blades a credit, whatever unpaid scores might stare him in the face, would be a flagrant affront scarcely to be forgiven.|$|E
60|$|The {{day after}} the Buriats pitched their fresh camp {{one of the men}} {{reported}} that he had seen a large bear {{at the edge of a}} forest two miles from the huts. Alexis and Godfrey at once took their guns, borrowed a couple of long spears and two <b>hunting</b> <b>knives,</b> and started for the wood, the native going with them to show them the exact spot where he had seen the bear. There was a good deal of undergrowth about, and they thought it probable that the animal was not far off. The Buriat had brought a dog with him, and the animal at once began sniffing the ground. His master encouraged it, and presently it started, sniffing the ground as it went. It had gone but a few hundred yards when it stopped before a thick clump of bushes and began growling furiously. They had a short consultation, and then the two friends took up their post one at each corner of the bushes, while the Buriat went round to the rear of the clump with his dog and began beating the bushes with his stick, while the dog barked and yelped. A minute later a bear broke out of the bushes within four yards of Alexis.|$|E
60|$|Next he met {{a single}} Indian, unburdened, limping, lips compressed, and eyes set with the pain of a foot in which the quick fought a losing battle with the dead. All {{possible}} care had been taken of him, {{but in the last}} extremity the weak and unfortunate must perish, and Sitka Charley deemed his days to be few. The man could not keep up for long, so he gave him rough cheering words. After that came two more Indians, to whom he had allotted the task of helping along Joe, the third white man of the party. They had deserted him. Sitka Charley saw at a glance the lurking spring in their bodies, and knew they had at last cast off his mastery. So he was not taken unawares when he ordered them back in quest of their abandoned charge, and saw the gleam of the <b>hunting</b> <b>knives</b> that they drew from the sheaths. A pitiful spectacle, three weak men lifting their puny strength {{in the face of the}} mighty vastness; but the two recoiled under the fierce rifle blows of the one and returned like beaten dogs to the leash. Two hours later, with Joe reeling between them and Sitka Charley bringing up the rear, they came to the fire, where the remainder of the expedition crouched in the shelter of the fly.|$|E
60|$|At her hip hung a <b>hunting</b> <b>knife.</b> Her rifle {{was still}} in its boot at her pony's withers. Her {{revolver}} she had not brought.|$|R
60|$|With his <b>hunting</b> <b>knife</b> he quieted {{the frightened}} animal, {{severing}} its jugular; then he dragged it, bleeding, {{along the trail}} down to the drinking hole, the half smile persisting upon his ordinarily grave face. At the water's edge the ape-man stooped and with <b>hunting</b> <b>knife</b> and quick strong fingers deftly removed the dead kid's viscera. Scraping {{a hole in the}} mud, he buried these parts which he did not eat, and swinging the body to his shoulder took to the trees.|$|R
60|$|But Pawnee Brown {{was not yet}} defeated. He {{still held}} his trusty <b>hunting</b> <b>knife,</b> {{and he was not}} terrorized as some of the onlookers imagined.|$|R
