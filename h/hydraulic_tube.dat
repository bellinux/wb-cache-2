40|$|AbstractGenerally speaking, {{hydraulic}} control {{systems can be}} divided into two different driving concepts. The first one is the well-known valve-controlled system and the second one is the pump-controlled system. The former possesses the feature of fast dynamic response. However, the poor energy-saving performance is its major fault. On the contrary, the pump-controlled hydraulic system has the significant advantage of energy-saving which meets the current demand in modern machine design. In this paper, the simulation analysis using Matlab/Simulink and DSHplus for a newly developed energy-saving <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tube</b> bender is conducted. Instead of the conventional fixed displacement hydraulic pump, the new <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tube</b> bender utilizes an internal gear pump with AC servomotor as its driving power source. In the new energy-saving hydraulic circuit, the use of conventional pressure relief valve is no longer necessary since the demanded flow-rate and pressure output can be precisely obtained by continuously changing the speed of the AC servomotor. In addition, from the simulation results, it is shown that the energy-saving performance of load-sensing control scheme is somewhat better than that of constant pressure control scheme. Furthermore, the simulation results also show that the newly developed <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tube</b> bender can save up to 40 % of energy consumption in a working cycle as compared to the conventional <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tube</b> bender...|$|E

The Al wires withstand relatively high tension {{for the large}} ratio of Al to steel, so the grip strength of crimping tube designed according to traditional experiences cannot {{meet the requirements of}} standard. Optimized design of crimping tube is necessary to minimize the strength loss of Al wires caused by crimping and improve grip strength. Orthogonal test schemes basing on combinations of different inner diameters and taper lengths of tube are designed after analyzing the factors which influence the grip strength. The influencing effects on grip strength of inner diameters and taper lengths are discovered by normal statistical analysis on test results of different tubes and the same conductor. The guaranteed value of grip strength residual ratio for optimal tube is gained.

40|$|It is a {{well-known}} fact that minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has many benefits, e. g., unnecessary trauma and blood loss can be minimized by opening tiny surgery scars, recovery process of patients can be lessened, and the possibilities of complications can be decreased. Although robots are widely used in MIS due to their fundamental superiorities such as high precision, current surgery robots mainly suffer from absence/limitation of haptic feedback during operation. This paper proposes a novel electrohydraulic haptic transmission system to improve the haptic feedback of a surgery robot. This new device replaces the highly nonlinear mechanical friction of thrust wire by viscous friction and avoids the backlash due to the incompressibility of fluid. Moreover, since the fluid is constantly occupying the entire volume of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tube,</b> the system behavior during bending of the tube can be modeled much easier than the thrust wire, for which position, shape, and bending angles of the inner wire inside the outer tube are hardly predictable.

However, current knowledge regarding the proper design and operation of hydraulic flocculation systems is insufficient. Of particular interest to the AguaClara research team is the optimal fluid shear level needed to produce low turbidity water. The Flocculation Residual Turbidity Analyzer (FReTA) was developed as tool for measuring the floc sedimentation velocity distribution and the post-sedimentation residual turbidity of a flocculated suspension. These two properties are central to the design and operation of unit processes following flocculation in a water treatment plant. FReTA measures the turbidity of a flocculent suspension undergoing quiescent sedimentation. The fixed distance across which flocs must travel to clear the measurement volume in FReTA allows sedimentation velocities to be calculated from the raw turbidity data. By fitting the transformed turbidity data with a modified gamma distribution, the mean and variance of the sedimentation velocity distribution can be obtained along with the post-sedimentation residual turbidity. A <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tube</b> flocculator was used to study how fluid shear levels affect the settling properties of a flocculated alum-kaolin suspension.

Results showed that shear induced floc break up occurred at all velocity gradients evaluated.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present work is to study the {{correlation}} between the main geometrical tube parameters of the rotary draw bending process and the resulting quality of the cross-section of small hydraulic pipings. The method of choice, named free rotary draw bending, is a rotary draw bending process where no internal support from an internal mandrel or plug is possible, because <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tubes</b> cannot be lubricated on their internal diameter. Furthermore, no axial boosting of the tube or of the pressure die is applied. Free bending is mainly used when small-diameter tubes are involved, with high length and relatively thin wall. A unique quality estimator QCS of the cross-section geometry of bent tubes has been developed, which is able to synthetically represent the main functional and aesthetical properties of tubes: the maximum ovalization, the minimum hydraulic diameter, and so on. In the case of copper <b>tubes</b> for <b>hydraulic</b> applications a strongly deformed cross-section after bending means a poor quality of the product, since it delivers an increase of head losses and of pressure drops. The deformation occurring in the cross-section of the tube has been studied through a set of FEM simulations, run with an explicit code with shell elements, and the model has been validated by comparing the experimental and numerical results of specific cases, in terms of geometry of the cross-section in a 90 bend. The plan of simulations has been designed using the typical copper tube dimensions for hydro-thermo-sanitary applications and a few runs have been added with modified parameters with the aim of completing the plan for evaluating the sensitivity to a change either in geometrical variables (thickness t, outer diameter OD, mean bending radius RM) or in the tube material.

Tremors can have peripheral and central oscillatory components which properly assessed and separated may improve diagnostics. An MR-safe haptic wrist manipulator enables simultaneous measurement of proprioceptive reflexes (peripheral components) and brain activations (central components) through fMRI. For such a MR-safe manipulator, this study determined the design criteria, created the design and presented its prototype. The prototype is divided into an MR-safe and MR-unsafe part. The hydraulic MR-safe vane motor (end effector) and optical sensors in the MR-environment are connected to the MR-unsafe part in the control room via <b>hydraulic</b> <b>tubes</b> and optical fibers. As a result, the fMRI quality is ensured and the manipulator is suited for safe use in any MR-environment. During a test in an MR-scanner (AMC, Amsterdam) no distortions in the MR-image or sensor signal were observed. The vane motor has a range of motion of 134 ° with a designed torque delivery of 8 Nm at a 3 bar pressure difference. The achieved accuracy for the torque sensor is ± 2 % full scale (F. S. = 14. 3 Nm) and for the absolute position sensor ± 1 % full scale (F. S. = 70 = 1. 22 rad). The prototype vane motor had some leakage along the axis, this prevented the use of pre-pressure and consequently reduced the bandwidth and maximum torque. However the maximum achieved torque of 1. 5 Nm was still enough to met the requirement of 1. 2 Nm. A PI controller was used to control the system, however this controller could not cope with the inherent non-linearities of hydraulics over the intended bandwidth (20 Hz). Despite the fact that the controller was not optimal, typical responses were obtained with impedance FRFs of two inertial loads. For future research it is recommended to remedy the axis leakage and implement a model-based controller. The open-loop FRF of the commanded velocity to the measured vane velocity was determined to characterize the system. Even with leakage and without pre-pressure, the measured bandwidth (- 3 dB) was approximately 5 Hz and the - 180 ° phase is passed at 7 Hz. Although the bandwidth does not fulfill the requirement for proprioceptive reflex identification it does allow for various motor control experiments. With the recommendations carried out, it is expected that the next prototype will be suited for proprioceptive reflex identification during fMRI.
