40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to provide general assessment of the role of constitutional provisions regulating agriculture in the shaping of agricultural law. The author first analyses relevant provisions in selected European constitutions and then discusses article 23 o f Poland's Constitution in more detail. Article 23 provides that <b>the</b> basis o <b>f</b> <b>the</b> agricultural system o <b>f</b> <b>the</b> State is the family farm. Looking for guidelines how to construe this constitutional 'agricultural' provision, the author quotes other provisions, and in particular the one which describes the social market economy as the basis of the economic system. The agricultural system (as well as the agricultural market) is an element o f a social market economy. Thus agriculture is also part o <b>f</b> <b>the</b> national economy, which means a departure from the strictly liberal attitude to it, allowing for certain corrections, or adjustments o <b>f</b> <b>the</b> market rules. In conclusion the author states that <b>the</b> provisions o <b>f</b> Poland's constitution justify an agricultural policy whose aim is to ensure that agriculture enjoys more favourable development conditions than those secured by the available market mechanisms. Such a policy is based on the need to take account o <b>f</b> <b>the</b> specificity o <b>f</b> agriculture that makes it so distinct from other sectors o <b>f</b> <b>the</b> economy. The actual role o <b>f</b> <b>the</b> Constitution o <b>f</b> <b>the</b> Polish Republic in <b>the</b> development o <b>f</b> agricultural law is not significant. As the legislative experience has shown so far, while the 'corrective' function o <b>f</b> <b>the</b> 'agricultural' provision of Poland's Constitution is very clear, its creative function is not at all pronounced.

The term “transfer o f milk quota” contained in <b>the</b> title o <b>f</b> <b>the</b> paper is used in its broad sense. It covers both <b>the</b> disposal o <b>f</b> <b>the</b> quota (definitive transfer) and <b>the</b> granting o <b>f</b> <b>the</b> right to use the quota (temporary transfer). <b>The</b> system o <b>f</b> <b>the</b> milk quota transfer chosen by Poland does not rely on the strict, inseparable link between the quota and the holding. Moreover, it works in only one direction. This means that the disposal of, or <b>the</b> granting o <b>f</b> a right to use holding entails <b>the</b> transfer o <b>f</b> quota as well, while in order to transfer the quota only, {{it is not necessary}} to dispose o <b>f</b> <b>the</b> holding or grant the right to use it. Thus, it is possible to transfer the milk quota definitively or temporarily without <b>the</b> transfer o <b>f</b> or granting <b>the</b> right to use the holding.
