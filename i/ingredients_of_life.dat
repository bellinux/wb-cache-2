50|$|Compartmentalization was {{important}} in the origins of life. Membranes create enclosed compartments that are separate from the external environment, thus providing the cell with functionally specialized aqueous spaces. Because lipid bilayer of membranes is impermeable to most hydrophilic molecules (dissolved by water), the cell must have membrane transport systems that {{are in charge of}} import of nutritive molecules as well as export of waste. It is very challenging to construct protocells from molecular assemblies. An important step in this challenge is the achievement of vesicle dynamics that are relevant to cellular functions, such as membrane trafficking and self-reproduction, using amphiphilic molecules. On the primitive Earth, numerous chemical reactions of organic compounds produced the <b>ingredients</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> Of these substances, amphiphilic molecules might be the first player in the evolution from molecular assembly to cellular life. A step from vesicle toward protocell might be to develop self-reproducing vesicles coupled with the metabolic system.|$|E

30|$|Research based {{instruction}} promotes acquiring skills, {{strategies and}} behaviors (Schunk, 2012) {{as the most}} important point for learning. According to Asyafah (2014) learning is the basis for knowledge development, and also the foundation of faith and belief. It is an important activity in human life because people are the vicegerents on earth (al-Baqarah [2]: 30). Faith, belief and knowledge are important <b>ingredients</b> <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> A combination of knowledge, faith and belief are the basis for living a better life. A research based approach in the teaching of Islamic education must comprise “materials to be taught, presentation of materials in short steps, opportunity for learner practice, provision of collective feedback and scheduling of review sessions” (Rosenshine and Stevens, 1986; Shuell, 1988, 1990; Schunk, 2012). It is through such an instructional approach that today’s challenges facing the modern world can be avoided and or solved (Nasoetion, 2007). Combining research in the teaching and learning process through a seminar course has all the above mentioned aspects. The approach combines both theory and practice in Islamic education. To implement these two basic tasks, human beings must have a strong foundation of faith and devotion as well as adequate knowledge.|$|E

This paper addresses the issues of community member involvement in a variety of performances that incorporate the teaching staff from a Conservatorium, the Central Queensland Conservatorium of Music in Mackay. Performances that utilise the expertise of the staff members and participation of the student body, such as the public lecture recital examples, can create a whole range of learning opportunities for all involved. The performances cited provide the opportunity for both learning and involvement – the two key <b>ingredients</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> long learning. Performance attendance has provided an excellent opportunity to make the community aware of the total activities of the larger institution, not only those of the conservatorium. Associated public performances by students have engendered a sense of ownership and involvement in the continuing development of individual students and the Conservatorium itself. By building life long learning communities, the benefits of this educative performance process for the general public and the students can have a flow on effect, bringing awareness of the Conservatorium to the community at large and a sense of pride in its achievements...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the current}} goals of Martian {{exploration}} is to find evidence for extinct (or even extant) life. Carbon (an essential <b>ingredient</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> on Earth) is known to occur on Mars as CO 2 in the atmosphere and frozen in the polar caps; it is inferred to be present as carbonates in the Martian crust and soils. We are attempting to define and quantify the different carbon reservoirs on Mars, {{so that we can}} follow Mars' carbon cycle. This paper discusses a primordial magmatic component that could be the starting point of such a cycle. The nature, distribution and isotopic composition of carbon was measured in a suite of Martian meteorites, comprising Chassigny and 11 shergottites. Other Martian meteorites were not included, as they sample rocks that have been altered by fluids at Mars' surface. Our results, obtained by high-resolution stepped combustion and mass spectrometry, show that the magmatic component has a very variable abundance of 1 – 100 ppm, with [delta] 13 C~[minus sign] 20 ± 4 ‰. This value is close to magmatic carbon determined for Moon and for Vesta (the parent body of the HED basaltic meteorites), but very different from that of Earth...|$|R

These “mixed” forms of cell death allow us to highlight the interconnected nature of cell death forms, particularly apoptosis and necrosis. The interdependence between apoptosis, autophagy and necrosis, and their significance for cancer development and treatment are also analyzed in further parts of the review. In the concluding parts, the afore-mentioned issues will be put in perspective for the development of novel anti-cancer therapies...|$|R

Besides being food producers, trees also provide other services to mankind. Trees provide housing and shelter to most living animals and also provide shade from scorching sun and rain.

40|$|We use the C/N ratio as {{a monitor}} of the {{delivery}} of key <b>ingredients</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> to nascent terrestrial worlds. Total elemental C and N contents, and their ratio, are examined for the interstellar medium, comets, chondritic meteorites and terrestrial planets; we include an updated estimate for the Bulk Silicate Earth (C/N = 49. 0 +/- 9. 3). Using a kinetic model of disk chemistry, and the sublimation/condensation temperatures of primitive molecules, we suggest that organic ices and macro-molecular (refractory or carbonaceous dust) organic material are the likely initial C and N carriers. Chemical reactions in the disk can produce nebular C/N ratios of ~ 1 - 12, {{comparable to those of}} comets and the low end estimated for planetesimals. An increase of the C/N ratio is traced between volatile-rich pristine bodies and larger volatile-depleted objects subjected to thermal/accretional metamorphism. The C/N ratios of the dominant materials accreted to terrestrial planets should therefore be higher than those seen in carbonaceous chondrites or comets. During planetary formation, we explore scenarios leading to further volatile loss and associated C/N variations owing to core formation and atmospheric escape. Key processes include relative enrichment of nitrogen in the atmosphere and preferential sequestration of carbon by the core. The high C/N BSE ratio therefore is best satisfied by accretion of thermally processed objects followed by large-scale atmospheric loss. These two effects must be more profound if volatile sequestration in the core is effective. The stochastic nature of these processes hints that the surface/atmospheric abundances of biosphere-essential materials will likely be variable. Comment: Accepted by PNAS per [URL]...|$|E
40|$|This book brings {{together}} the finest collection available of star clusters, galaxies, nebulae {{and other such}} spectacular phenomena caught on film. Each beautiful image, made {{from a series of}} delicate yet rich platinum prints, is accompanied by a clear and engaging caption. Malin&# 039;s short texts (approximately 100 words) describe the depicted phenomena and some of the mythology surrounding them. The book is divided into nine sections, using the constellations as a framework to identify the positions of the images in the sky. Each section is introduced by a short text describing the featured constellations and a celestial map. In his introductory essay, Malin outlines the history and importance of photographing the night sky, describing how very long exposures taken with a telescope reveal stars and distant galaxies too faint to be seen by the eye. By studying galaxies, we learn about our origins and perhaps our destiny and, the origins of the <b>ingredients</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> and the destinies of stars like the Sun and the planets associated with them. Much of our current knowledge on these subjects was gleaned from black and white photographs like those in this book, which were originally taken for scientific purposes. Using the world&# 039;s most sophisticated telescopes and his own revolutionary techniques, Malin brings us awe-inspiring images of distant worlds and amazing phenomena. He is a pioneer of space photography and has invented new ways of capturing the unseen universe on photographic plates, leading to the discovery of two new types of galaxies.

As {{a result of}} the citizenry’s increased awareness of this fact, states are requiring food manufacturers to disclose which of their products are genetically modified. However, {{within the context of the}} First Amendment to the United States Constitution, state-mandated labeling of genetically modified food stands on an infirm foothold. The constitutionality of these disclosure requirements turns on whether state-mandated, genetically modified food labels are uncontroversial. Moreover, under the commercial speech doctrine, it is unclear how a court should assess and what a court should examine to determine whether compelled commercial speech is controversial. This Note proposes that (1) a court should examine the speech’s tendency to advance a controversial ideology, and (2) a court can assess the speech’s tendency to advance a controversial ideology by determining if the speech is relevant to a normative value and whether the speech’s normative force outweighs its informative force.

40|$|Air, the {{harbinger of}} life, {{one of the}} major <b>ingredients</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> support system, has become a serious threat to life of all living organisms {{including}} human beings because it is being loaded with several kinds of pollutants. The activities of modern world had been responsible for these changes in the atmosphere. In addition to chemical pollutants, biological materials such as pollen, bacteria, viruses and spores are also present and are responsible for deteriorating quality of air. Bacteria {{play an important role in}} the geochemical cycle. They could be used for monitoring pollution and for removing/reducing pollution load as well. Bacteria tend to acquire genetic components for these processes and environmental forces. select the fittest organisms. In this manner bacteria varies from one environment to another and tend to be unique to an area. The aim of this study was to screen the phenotypic and genotypic characters of airborne bacteria isolated from different sites of Karachi city. During this study four sites were selected for the isolation of airborne bacteria, these sites were Karachi University, Gaddani (Ship breaking area), Tanneries at Korangi sector 7 -A and Civil Hospital. 55 pure strains were isolated from these sites, they were identified, gram stained and their resistance to various antibiotics and metals were studied. Most of the strains were found to be resistant to antibiotics and heavy metals, which indicated antibiotics and metal pollution in those sites. On the basis of genotypic characteristics the strains were screened for reduction, accumulation and solubilization activity against heavy metals. Among the isolated strains CMG 821 (Pseudomonas 'sp.) showed accumulation of copper salt, whereas in CMG 480 (Cucurbit yellow vine disease bacterium) aerobic and anaerobic reduction of chromate was observed. Analysis of cell sections using transmission electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) showed intracellular copper in CMG 821 (Pseudomonas sp.) but CMG 480 (Cucurbit yellow vine disease bacterium) precipitated chromate extracellularly. CMG 8 I 4. (Klebsiella sp.), CMG 818 (Pseudomonas sp.), CMG 823 (Pseudomonas sp.) and CMG 826 (Pseudomonas sp.) showed metal solubilization activity. Among these CMG 814 was found to have plasmid DNA of 9. 9 kb and 7. 5 kb The plasmids were successfully transferred to E. coli J- 53 and JM-I 09 nonsolubilizing strains by conjugation and transformation. The zone of solubilization were formed by the transformants and transconjugants as well. Tn mutants of CMG 823 (which did not show the presence of plasmid) were produced these mutants lacked the solubilizing activity; this suggested that perhaps the solubilizing genes (Sol+) were present on chromosomes in this strain. The results of tn mutants, transformants and transconjugants have suggested that the solubilizing genes are perhaps spread on both chromosomes and plasmid and their location varies in various strains. To conclude this study has produced a collection of air-borne bacterial strains. This collection may also contribute towards discovery of novel species, native to this area and they could later on be exploited for bioremediation...|$|E
40|$|The health {{sector is}} a vital {{component}} of the growth and maintenance of every economy. When you examine any country’s annual budget, you immediately recognize that a large proportion goes to the healthcare sector. You may also see {{it is a part}} of expenditure and not of productivity. In other words, healthcare is a liability item {{when it comes to the}} budget. Libya is no exception. The goal of the health planners is to allocate the healthcare budget in ways that will ultimately result in a healthier society. In Libya, unfortunately, it is not clear how much of the budget goes to the health profession and health care delivery, and how much of it is spent on administrative issues. When you focus on the health sector you discover that it is really a significant mover of the productivity line. It is very simple. Healthy citizens are more likely to go to school and be educated. They are also more likely to have steady employment and be productive members of the society. That is not the subject of these comments. No one can deny that the Libyan physicians are on the frontline when it comes to criticism of the health services in Libya. I agree that they should be on the frontline. After all, medical schools in Libya started many years before the creation of other colleges for allied health professionals. They have a major share of responsibility in keeping our citizens healthy. It is also their responsibility to treat those who become sick. This requires a health system with a solid, transparent, ethical, and well organized structure. This is not the subject of my comments either. The purpose of my comments today is to draw attention to the Libyan physicians and recognize them once a year. I feel that they are busy with their work and the basic <b>ingredients</b> <b>of</b> <b>life</b> in a developing country. I also believe that they are relatively forgotten by society. What I would like to propose is the creation of a national observation for the Libyan physician. I think it is time to celebrate a Libyan Physician Day (Youm attabeeb alleebi) during which the Libyan physician is recognized in all health institutions at the level of the ministry, press, television, radio, as well as hospitals and rural health care units. During this day, we thank the Libyan physician for his/her hard work under diverse conditions and circumstances (1). During this day, we remind the physician of his/her duty toward humanity in general and Libyan citizens in particular. The physicians need to know that they have a moral and ethical (2) duty toward the Libyan citizen from birth to death. This duty extends to the poor and to the wealthy and it does not discriminate against colour, race, or religion of the citizen. This duty is purely humane and has no allegiance to political beliefs. We also remind the Libyan physician to extend his/her hands to colleagues in basic science, in different sectors of medical education, and the allied medical personnel. We all know that without nurses, pharmacists, physiotherapists, respiratory therapist, laboratory technicians, physicists and radiology technicians we can not perform our jobs. On this day, we inform the Libyan physicians that we love them and respect their field. The society and government should be united in providing them with decent living standards. The Libyan physicians are human and have needs and responsibilities toward their families and deserve a decent life. This acknowledgment by the society and the government gives them a moral boost. Hopefully, it would provide an incentive to work harder and to be creative to minimize the flux of the Libyan patients to the neighbouring countries for the treatment of simple ailments. I truly believe that the creation of a national day for the Libyan physician will be fruitful within few years of its initiation. It will certainly shed the light on this group of the Libyan society. It will remind physicians to give more consideration to interactions with members of the Libyan society. We hope the idea will find its way to the legislators to adopt and designate a day to celebrate the Libyan Physician. This day can be any time; however, I would propose selecting a day in the summer to enable the participation of most Libyan physicians while children are out of school. Such participation could be in the form of public health screenings and information about major diseases such as diabetes, high blood pressure, strokes and breast cancer. Informational discussions of socio-medical problems such as substance abuse and drug addiction could also be included. It is my hope that my colleagues will discuss this issue, voice their opinions, and provide suggestions of other activities to commemorate our physicians on this day...|$|E

In these poems we find the collision of Yeats's own conflicting ideals about poetry, politics, and history; a collision which produces a complex portrayal of Irish political violence...|$|R

Taking into account the parallel processing of a heterogeneous population and sexual propagation with recombination {{as well as the}} endogenous adaptation of strategy characteristics, simulated evolution reveals a couple of interesting, sometimes surprising, properties of nature's learning-by-doing algorithm. `Survival of the fittest', often taken as Darwin's view, {{turns out to be a}} bad advice. Forgetting, i. e. individual death, and even regression show up to be necessary <b>ingredients</b> <b>of</b> the <b>life</b> game. Whether the process should be termed gradualistic or punctualistic, is a matter of the observer's point of view. He even might observe `long waves'. 1. INTRODUCTION Evolution can be looked at from a large variety of positions. Beginning wi [...] ...|$|R

Whereas the Western concept of {{the self is}} primarily based on the ideals of individualism, eastern traditions tend to regard the self as {{a small part of}} the collective and the cosmos. Consistent with the Western understanding of the self, enhancing autonomy, independence, self-esteem, and a strong ego is considered to be a vital <b>ingredient</b> <b>of</b> a good <b>life</b> in these cultures. In contrast, in Asian traditions, the individual self is de-emphasised in one way or another. For example, in Buddhism, the existence of an individual self is considered an illusion.|$|R

Rather, it is possible to separate between happiness or satisfaction and meaning, purpose, or growth as two <b>ingredients</b> <b>of</b> a <b>life</b> well lived (McGregor and Little [1998]; Vittersø and Søholt [2011]; Vittersø et al. [2010]). In support of this view, there is research showing that meaning in life or growth are weakly related, unrelated, or even negatively related to measures of SWB (e.g., Bauer, McAdams, and Sakaeda [2005]; Delle Fave, Brdar, Freire, Vella-Brodrick, and Wissing [2011]; Keyes [2000]; McGregor and Little [1998]). Thus, some PWB dimensions, and in particular self-acceptance and environmental mastery, can be expected to serve as pathways to life satisfaction, while others show weaker or no relations with life satisfaction. Especially purpose in life and personal growth have been considered as central to meaning rather than happiness (Ryff and Singer [1998]; see also McGregor and Little [1998]).|$|R

Tailored lifestyle coaching services offer individual users access to web portals where they can communicate about a growing number <b>of</b> <b>ingredients</b> <b>of</b> everyday <b>life</b> concern: physical activity, nutrition, medication, mood, sleep. Mobile technology in combination with body worn sensors support user’s awareness of their physical condition and lifestyle. Despite {{the large number of}} available lifestyle interventions and pilot trials, only very few are successfully transferred into the real health care practice. This paper presents new insights and recommendations for the design of lifestyle support systems with personalized virtual coaching based on two user studies. The first study focuses on the mobile physical activity coaching for diabetes patients and office workers. The second study summarizes the persuasive factors on attitudes of high-risk adolescents towards a virtual coach in mobile eHealth applications and social media. We present a new approach that integrates an animated digital coach in an activity monitoring lifestyle change support system...|$|R
