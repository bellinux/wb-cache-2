40|$|Developing {{quantified}} {{establishment period}} estimates for newly planted trees will help set realistic goals for plant {{performance in the}} urban landscape. Nine years of tree planting records obtained {{from the city of}} Boston, MA and the town of Brookline, MA were used to derive samples of trunk caliper for <b>hedge</b> <b>maple</b> (Acer campestre), London planetree (Platanus x acerifolia), and red oak (Quercus rubra). Several site characteristics were measured to identify effects on newly planted tree growth. Breakpoint estimates of the piecewise regression models fell at 4 years and 6 years for London planetree and <b>hedge</b> <b>maple</b> respectively, showing establishment periods for urban trees are longer than the conventional 3 years. Pit area has a significant effect on caliper growth for London planetree and red oak, with larger growing spaces yielding larger trees. Observed soil bulk densities did not {{have a significant effect on}} caliper measurement for any of the species tested. Mean soil bulk density was 1. 4 g/cm 3, 1. 45 g/cm 3, and 1. 49 g/cm 3 for <b>hedge</b> <b>maple,</b> London planetree, and red oak respectively. Soil texture was significant for <b>hedge</b> <b>maple</b> only, with percent clay showing significant positive effects and percent sand as marginally significant. Pit type showed a significant effect on caliper measurement of London planetree with grass strips producing the largest caliper trees followed by open pits. Planting locations with tree grates produced the smallest caliper trees. Presence of perforated air vents produced significantly larger caliper trees than sites with an air vent present for red oak...|$|E
40|$|Viscum album L. is a semiparasitic plant {{grown on}} trees and widely {{used for the}} {{treatment}} of many diseases in traditional and complementary therapy. It is well known that some activities of Viscum album extracts are varied depending on the host trees, such as antioxidant, apoptosis-inducing, anticancer activities of the plant. The aim of the present study is to examine the comparative effects of methanolic extracts of V. album grown on three different host trees (locust tree, lime tree, and <b>hedge</b> <b>maple</b> tree) on H 2 O 2 -induced DNA damage in HeLa cells. Oxidative damage in mitochondrial DNA and two nuclear regions was assessed by QPCR assay. The cells were pretreated with methanolic extracts (10 [*]μg/mL) for 48 [*]h, followed by the treatment with 750 [*]μM H 2 O 2 for 1 hour. DNA damage was significantly induced by H 2 O 2 while it was inhibited by V. album extracts. All extracts completely protected against nuclear DNA damage. While the extract from lime tree or white locust tree entirely inhibited mitochondrial DNA damage, that from <b>hedge</b> <b>maple</b> tree inhibited by only 50 %. These results suggest that methanolic extracts of V. album can prevent oxidative DNA damage, and the activity is dependent on the host tree...|$|E
40|$|Tree species {{composition}} and structural dynamics in forest stands under natural {{evolution in the}} Montedimezzo M. a. B. reserve. This study is included in an experimental protocol established in 1954 aimed at examining the natural dynamics in mixed broadleaves high forests dominated by Turkey oak (Quercus cerris L.) and beech (Fagus sylvatica L.). Stand development patterns in {{the last fifteen years}} are reported. Repeated quantitative and qualitative inventories were carried out in two permanent plots (3 ha each) and in two structural transects (0. 2 ha each) located in Collemeluccio-Montedimezzo M. a. B. reserve (Is). The study highlighted, as already observed in 1954, {{the differences between the two}} multilayered stands. In the higher elevation beech is the predominant species recording 53 % of importance value index (I), followed by Turkey oak (I= 25 %). In the lower elevation the dominant species is Turkey oak (I= 46 %), followed by hornbeam (Carpinus betulus L.) (I= 28 %) and beech (I= 12 %). The decreased presence of Turkey oak and the increase of beech density are confirmed in each plot over the last fifteen years. Among the other tree species, importance values rise only for silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) (introduced) and holly tree (Ilex aquifolium L.), while hornbeam and <b>hedge</b> <b>maple</b> have been reducing their own presence. </p...|$|E
40|$|Challenges {{to street}} tree {{survival}} {{and the resulting}} short lifespans are frequently discussed but inadequately quantified. This study addresses trends in street tree mortality by reviewing published literature and by assessing street trees in Philadelphia 2 - 10 years after planting. Proposed causes of mortality and decline in street trees include poor soil and atmospheric conditions, natural disturbances, and direct human actions. Street tree mortality studies carried out to date have measured mortality using {{a wide variety of}} methodologies and have shown a wide range of results. Reported survival rates from thirteen published studies in temperate climates are compared. Annual survival rates are estimated for each study, and range from 34. 7 to 99. 7 %. Linear regression analysis of eleven of these studies reveals a significant relationship between survival and time period since planting (estimated r 2 = 0. 69, estimated annual survival 94. 2 %). Methods for estimating average lifespan are also discussed. Street tree survival in Philadelphia was assessed for comparison to published literature. Select street trees species planted in the years 1995 - 2003 in North Philadelphia were surveyed to assess survival rates, and to identify trends in mortality and tree size. These trees were planted by the Philadelphia Green program of the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society. The overall survival of street trees 8 - 10 years after planting is 57 %. Planting year specific survival rates for 8, 9, and 10 years after planting are 44 %, 58 %, and 63 %, respectively. These values are comparable to those predicted by the analysis of previously published studies. Survival of trees 8 - 10 years after planting varies significantly by species, zip code, and U. S. Census indicators. Current tree size varied significantly by exposed soil area and sidewalk condition. One select species, <b>hedge</b> <b>maple,</b> was chosen for additional study to assess temporal trends in street tree mortality. Hedge maples 2 - 10 years after planting in North Philadelphia were surveyed. Time period since planting was significantly correlated to survival (estimated r 2 = 0. 75, estimated annual survival 95. 5 %). Conclusions about the causes of mortality in the study area are suggestive, but limited. Power analysis of tree diameter and site vehicular disturbance indicates that a sample size upwards of 1000 would be needed to detect difference. Recommendations are made for future data collection of street tree studies in Philadelphia and elsewhere...|$|E
40|$|U park-šumi Maksimir, u mješovitoj sastojini hrasta lužnjaka i običnoga graba (Carpino betuli-Quercetum roboris/Anić 1959 / Rauš 1969), analiziran je utjecaj svjetla na brojnost i kvalitetu mladog hrastovog naraštaja. Pokusna ploha obuhvatila je dvije pomladne jezgre u razvojnom stadiju mladika i površinu između jezgri u fazi ponika te mlađeg i starijeg pomlatka. Analiza podataka pokazala je da se prirodno pomlađivanje na malim površinama u park-šumi Maksimir odvija uspješno. Broj biljaka po jedinici površine je zadovoljavajući i iznosi 8, 3 kom/m 2. Prema vrsti smjese to je mješovita sastojina hrasta lužnjaka i običnoga graba s manjim udjelom divlje trešnje (PrunusaviumL.), klena (Acer campestreL.), lipe (Tiliasp.) i mliječa (A. platanoidesL.). Prednost mješovitih sastojina ogleda se u biološkoj i ekološkoj ravnoteži, a to su glavni ciljevi gospodarenja u park-šumi Maksimir. No, kvaliteta mladog na raštaja hrasta lužnjaka je upitna. Posljedica visoke gustoće biljaka na pom-lad noj površini je visok prosječni koeficijent vitkosti mladog hrastovog naraštaja. Velik udio deformiranih debala, loše razvijenih krošnji i prevelika zastupljenost korovske vegetacije posljedica su nenjegovanja pomlatka. Utvrđene su prosječne godišnje relativne vrijednosti difuznog i izravnog svjetla u pojedinim razvojnim stadijima hrasta lužnjaka. Ovisnost broja biljaka u različitim razvojnim stadijima o svjetlosnim uvjetima pojedinog mikrostaništa potvrđena je ? 2 testom. Dobivena je jaka pozitivna linearna ko re lacija između prosječnog visinskog prirasta hrasta lužnjaka i vrijednosti izravnog svjetla (r = 0, 5809). In {{a forest}} park Maksimir, in a mixed forest stand of Pedunculate Oak and Common Hornbeam (Carpino betuli-Quercetum roboris/Anić 1959 / Rauš 1969), {{influence}} of light conditions on number {{and quality of}} young oak growth was investigated. Experimental plot covered two regeneration gaps and the space between, including the trees in a different stage of development (seedlings, saplings and young trees). Measurements were taken in the winter 2006 and spring 2007 in a single plot within the stand. The plot was divided in 105 sub-plots of 1. 5 m x 1. 5 m and on each sub-plot height (cm), tree length (cm), ground level diameter (mm) and last five height increments (cm) were measured. Parallel to the measurement, evaluation of stem quality, crown form and tree health state was conducted. Spatial distribution of old grown trees at the plot area, together with crown projections, was recorded. At each sub-plot a hemispherical photograph was taken. Average annual relative values of diffuse and direct light for different development stages of Pedunculate Oak were determined. Depending on the values of diffuse and direct light, four microsites (marked: A – D) with different light conditions were defined. Results indicate that natural regeneration in naturally occurring gaps could be considered successful. Average number of trees per square meter was 8. 3. Species composition of naturally occurring young trees in the gap indicates {{a continuation of the}} same forest community, namely mixed forest stand of Pedunculate Oak and Common Hornbeam with a smaller share of Wild Cherry (Prunus aviumL.), <b>Hedge</b> <b>Maple</b> (Acer campestreL.), Norway Maple (A. platanoidesL.) and Lime (Tiliasp.). Mixed forest stands are of great biological and ecological value, but also attractive to the park visitors. Maintaining them and their stability is a main management goal in this forest park. However, in naturally occurring gaps in the absence of silvicultural treatments the quality of young trees is questionable. High density of young growth at our plot resulted with high tree slenderness coefficient of 97, 7. Share of deformed tree stems was significant (30. 3 %), as well as share of badly developed tree crowns (44. 3 %). Great abundance of weed vegetation was recorded and {{can be attributed to the}} lack of silvicultural treatments during regeneration. Chi-square test showed statistically significant dependence of number of young oak growth in different development stages with respect to the light conditions at microsite. Lower values of direct and diffuse light (microsite C) correspond with great number of oak seedlings. Surviving of oak seedling in low light conditions confirms the fact that in first few years oak is shade tolerant. However, great abundance of oak saplings at microsites A (lower values of direct and higher values of diffuse light) and D (higher values of direct and lower values of diffuse light) indicates that oak, when it arrives to the stage of saplings, favours higher light conditions. This is further corroborated at microsite B (with high values of direct and diffuse light) where young oak trees were most abundant. Quality of oak saplings and young trees was better at microsite B. Young oak trees grown in high light conditions obtained greater height increment and stem verticality. High positive correlation is obtained between Pedunculate Oak average height increment and average values of direct light (r = 0, 5809) ...|$|E
