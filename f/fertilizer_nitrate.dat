The company had been a major factor already in World War I, when their development of the Haber-Bosch process for nitrogen fixation compensated for Germany's being {{cut off from the}} Chilean nitrate trade and allowed IG Farben to produce synthetic nitrate and extract and process nitrogen for use in agricultural <b>fertilizer.</b> (<b>Nitrate</b> is an important component for the fabrication of explosives such as gunpowder, dynamite or TNT.) In World War II, Degesch (42.5 per cent owned by IG Farben) was the trademark holder of Zyklon B, the poison gas used at some Nazi extermination camps. IG Farben also developed processes for synthesizing gasoline and rubber from coal, and thereby contributed much to Germany's ability to wage a war despite having been cut off from all major oil fields. The charges consequently centered on preparing to wage an aggressive war, but also on slave labor and plundering.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to clarify, the current status of alluvial aquifer in the Souss-Massa basin, where, the nitric pollution of groundwater is being increasing along the last decades. A multi-approach methodology using hydrogeology, nitrate concentrations, irrigation mode and Oxygen- 18 and Deuterium isotopes data, was carried out to identify the sources of this pollution. According to the spatial distribution of nitrate contents, nitric pollution occurs mainly in the Chtouka-Massa plain. More than 36 % of the sampled wells exceed the value of 50 mg L- 1 which, constitutes the threshold value of nitrate concentrations for drinking water Moroccan standards. The groundwater in Souss plain is less polluted comparing to Chtouka-Massa. Only 7 % of wells exceed the permitted level. The widespread distribution of high nitrate contents agrees with the distribution of irrigated areas, which can explain the major origin from agricultural fertilizers. High nitrate levels are associated with high δ 18 O values, clearly indicating that significant quantities of evaporated (isotopically enriched) irrigation water infiltrate along with <b>fertilizer</b> <b>nitrate</b> to the groundwater system. Different δ 18 O-NO 3 - trends suggest isotopically distinct, non-point source origins, which vary spatially and temporally, due to different degrees of evaporation/recharge and amounts of fertilizer applied...|$|E

40|$|Nitrate {{contamination}} in both surface water and groundwater has received considerable attentions in irrigated agricultural areas. Nitrate concentrations, and its nitrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions, {{as well as}} oxygen and deuterium isotopic compositions and chloride concentrations of surface water and groundwater from a typical area in the lower reaches of the Yellow River irrigation district were analyzed to ascertain spatial variations of nitrate and its possible sources and transformations. The {{results of this study}} showed nitrate in the Yellow River mainly derived from mineralization of organic matter in sediments and nitrification of atmospheric deposition, and nitrate in other important tributaries were greatly affected by agricultural activities, especially synthetic <b>fertilizer.</b> <b>Nitrate</b> in irrigation canals which go through concentrated residential zone mainly originated from domestic effluent and experienced nitrification. Nitrate in groundwater is not only affected by surface nitrate sources, but also closely related to hydraulic conditions which make nitrate source discrimination more complex. In areas belonging to the Yellow River basin with shallow water tables, nitrate is mainly derived from synthetic fertilizer, and denitrification processes controlled nitrate isotopic compositions in extremely shallow groundwater with low hydraulic gradients. While in places belonging to the Haihe River basin with deep water table, groundwater nitrate is largely affected by mixing process of irrigation water. The main sources of nitrate in groundwater are manure and sewage and soil organic matter, while chemical fertilizer and atmospheric deposition in large amount of rainfall are its minor contributors...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of N fertilizers with surface irrigation stream (surface N fertigation(is a key approach for fertilizer management. The main {{objective of this}} study was to investigate furrow fertigation management effects on distribution uniformity and runoff losses of nitrate in field scale. A field corn experiment was carried out with a complete randomized block design having 12 experiments. The field experiments were carried out in free draining furrows having 165 m length and 0. 006 m/m slope in Karaj. Required urea fertilizer was applied in four stages: before planting, in seven leaves stage, shooting stage and earring stage. The first stage was accomplished by traditional method and other stages were applied with irrigation water (fertigation). Fertigation timing was respectively 60, 35, and 20 min in the three fertigation stages. Results showed that distribution uniformity of water and fertilizer of low half (DULH) provided high values for all experiments. DULH ranged between 88. 0 to 99. 0 % and 89. 7 to 96. 0 %, respectively for water and fertilizer. Also, distribution uniformity of low quarter (DULQ) ranged between 86. 0 to 98. 2 % and 85. 7 to 91. 5 %, respectively for water and <b>fertilizer.</b> <b>Nitrate</b> losses through surface runoff ranged between 5. 7 to 42. 0 %.

40|$|Agricultural {{activities}} are frequently associated with water contamination. The spreading and storage of fertilizers, for instance, {{may result in}} groundwater contamination due to pollutants leaching into an aquifer. Nitrates and fecal bacteria are two important contaminants associated with agriculture. Thus, the development of efficient strategies for groundwater protection in agricultural areas requires an assessment of these two contaminants. Given this perspective, groundwater quality monitoring was carried out over the whole capture zone of a municipal well located in an agricultural area in the St. -Lawrence Lowlands in Québec. Thirty-eight piezometers were installed within the roughly 2 km 2 capture area of the well to measure physico-chemical parameters such as major ions, field measured parameters (pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, water level, temperature), and isotopic ratios, bacteriological parameters (Heterotrophic Plate Count [...] HPC, enterococci, total coliforms, Escherichia coli) and their variations in space and time. Groundwater was sampled from the pumping well and the piezometers during 25 field campaigns in 2005, 2006 and 2007. The results demonstrate the impact of agricultural activities on nitrate contamination. They indicate high spatial and temporal variations in nitrate concentrations, from 6 to 125 mgNO 3 -/L within the capture area, with 40 % of the samples exceeding the Québec drinking water limit of 45 mgNO 3 -/L. Nitrate pollution in the municipal well exceeded 45 mgNO 3 -/L during 2005, but no bacteriological contamination was observed. The results also show a high variability of nitrate concentration with depth within the capture zone. Electrical conductivity appears as a good indicator {{of the presence of}} nitrate and calcium ions in this capture zone. Correlations between nitrate, calcium and chloride suggest that these ions come from the same source of <b>fertilizer.</b> <b>Nitrate</b> isotopic composition suggests that nitrate in groundwater originates from both chemical and organic fertilizers. The bacteriological results show that the extracted volume of water during sampling of a piezometer has {{a significant impact on the}} bacteria count. The variability of bacteriological pollution is important in space and time, showing a higher contamination during summer. Only 2 % of the raw water samples exhibit contamination exceeding the drinking water standard for treated water. Total coliforms seem to be a good precursor of E. coli or enterococci contamination. Globally, the physico-chemical and bacteriological groundwater quality within the studied capture area and the pumping well shows contamination by nitrates, but low contamination levels by fecal bacteria.

40|$|High {{deposition}} {{levels of}} atmospheric ammonia in the Netherlands {{have led to}} the major replacement of dwarf shrubs by grasses and to elevated nitrification rates in acid heathland soils. In order to study the efficacy of a naturally established grass-heath of Deschampsia flexuosa at capturing NO 3 -, an outdoor 'mesocosm' lysimeter experiment was Set up with relatively large and undisturbed soil columns from two Deschampsia-dominated heathland sites. One of the sites (Ede) had a relatively high rate of nitrate production, whereas the other (Hoorneboeg [HB]) showed practically no nitrate formation. For part of the Ede columns, the fate of labeled nitrate, split-applied at two rates (30 or 150 kg ha(- 1) yr(- 1)) during two seasons, was studied. D. flexuosa was highly effective in acquiring <b>fertilizer</b> <b>nitrate,</b> as demonstrated by (1) distinct rises in foliar NRA, especially at high N; (2) increased N- 15 enrichments in all plant components with N rate; (3) significant increases in organic-N and carboxylate concentration in several plant compartments; and (4) clear shifts in biomass allocation in favour of the aboveground tissues. After 18 months at low N, an average 39 and 23 % of the applied N was immobilized in the plant and soil compartments, respectively; at high N rate, corresponding recoveries were 33 and 20 %. Total leaching of nitrate (beyond a depth of 35 cm) from the unfertilized Ede columns corresponded to an annual loss of 1. 9 kmol N ha(- 1), whereas leaching was virtually zero from HB columns. Relatively high amounts of N leached from the fertilized columns with apparent fertilizer recovery in the leachate reaching an average 60 % at high N. However, N- 15 analyses revealed only recoveries of 2. 0 % (low N) and 7. 2 % (high N) of the applied N in the leachate. From columns where the plant cover had been removed, apparent and real leaching losses reached values of > 100 and 10 % of the applied N, respectively. Hence, soil-derived N appeared by far the major source of leaching. Unplanted and unfertilized HB columns displayed high rates of nitrification and leached high amounts of nitrate, suggesting a plant-induced repression of the in situ nitrification at this site. On average, planted columns had lost 37 % (low N) and 40 % (high N) of the applied N, whereas unplanted lysimeters had lost 89 % (for both low and high N). The N not recovered was presumed lost by denitrification due to favourable conditions with respect to nitrate concentration, moisture, carbon supply, and temperature.

Compared with the ammonium fertilizer application, the reductions of NO emissions caused by <b>nitrate</b> <b>fertilizer</b> and DCD addition were 100 % and 93 %, and of N 2 O emissions were 54 % and 74 %, respectively. Remarkable reductions of NO and N 2 O emissions were also observed from five different agricultural soils in the NCP by replacing ammonium with <b>nitrate</b> <b>fertilizer,</b> indicating that nitrification is the predominant process for the emissions of NO and N 2 O from the soils in the vast area of NCP. NO emission peaks were found to be several days later than N 2 O peaks after the application of ammonium fertilizer and flooding irrigation, implying that most of NO initially produced via nitrification process might be fast reduced to N 2 O under the high soil moisture condition. Interestingly, the relative contribution of denitrification to N 2 O emission showed obviously time-dependent, e. g., evident N 2 O emission caused by the application of nitrate was only observed after the basal fertilization for the maize and the top dressing for the wheat. Replacing ammonium with <b>nitrate</b> <b>fertilizer</b> and mixing with the nitrification inhibitor are verified to be effective measures for mitigating NO and N 2 O emissions from arable soils in the NCP.
