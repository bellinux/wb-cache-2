Early in testing it briefly stopped working twice, and then {{seventeen}} days into testing, it stopped completely.

Because of this <b>fault,</b> <b>testing</b> lasted longer than originally planned, with the satellite finally being powered down for storage as a backup in June 1998, a process that was originally scheduled for August of the previous year. Less than a month later, it was reactivated after the attitude control system on the GOES 9 satellite started to fail. During July, it was prepared for operational service, before assuming GOES-WEST operations {{at the end of the}} month. In August, it was moved to a longitude of 135° West, where it relieved GOES 9. GOES 10 transmitted weather data while it was still moving, which required users to track the satellite in order to continue receiving data.

40|$|BIST is an {{attractive}} approach to detect delay faults due to its inherent support for at-speed test. Deterministic logic BIST (DLBIST) is a technique which was successfully applied to stuck-at <b>fault</b> <b>testing.</b> As delay faults have lower random pattern testability than stuck-at faults, the need for DLBIST schemes is increased. Nevertheless, an extension to delay <b>fault</b> <b>testing</b> is not trivial, since this necessitates the application of pattern pairs.

These tests are performed at operating conditions comparable to operating conditions the component would be exposed to while installed on the aircraft. Performance of seeded <b>fault</b> <b>tests</b> is one method used to provide evidence that a Health Usage Monitoring System (HUMS) can replace current maintenance practices required for aircraft airworthiness.

But delay <b>fault</b> <b>testing</b> is not so mature as stuck-at <b>fault</b> <b>testing.</b> The paper surveys various delay fault models, their advantages and limitations. The current trends in test pattern generation for delay faults are analyzed, too. The test pattern generation is directly related to the coverage metrics. The coverage metrics mainly tend to evaluate the quality of path delay fault patterns. The focus is made on two groups of the metrics: non-enumeratve methods and statistical methods. The non-enumerative methods rely on the traditional counting of the paths, which are tested under robust, non-robust, or functional sensitization criteria. The statistical methods relate their computations to the parameters under process variation. The basis of the methods is their weakness. There is still no accepted common metric to evaluate the quality of the delay test patterns. On that base, the paper suggests a new approach to the evaluation of the quality of the delay test patterns. This approach stands on the new term – test confidence level (the ground level, the first level, the second level and etc.).
