40|$|The use of AA 6 xxx series alloys {{continues}} to grow with the increasing demand for more fuel efficient vehicles. AA 6 xxx series alloys are commonly used in automotive applications because of their extrudability and good strength/weight ratio. As {{the use of these}} alloys becomes more prominent, new technologies must be developed to improve them. Chromium has been used as an alloy addition to AA 6 xxx alloys to control the grain structure by creating dispersoids that pin grains and limit grain growth and thereby improve the mechanical properties of aluminum alloys. However, the addition of chromium and other transition metals can have some adverse effects on aluminum alloys including making them more quench sensitivity after processing. The objective of this research was to do study the effect of alloy composition including the effect of Cr on the quench sensitivity of AA 6 xxx aluminum alloys, and to measure the effect of quench sensitivity on subsequent mechanical properties both in the T 4 (naturally aged) and T 6 (artificially aged) temper conditions. The experiments were conducted using a standard Jominy quenched end test and also included tensile testing for various quenching conditions for the AA 6 xxx alloys studied. The <b>Jominy</b> <b>test</b> provided a large range of cooling rates, which provided data for the variation in hardness as a function of cooling history.

These two conflicting requirements have forced steel designers to consider micro-alloying, heat treatment and precipitation strengthening to meet market demands.

In this study the hardenability, the cooling rates and microstructures of low alloy Cr-Mo and Mn-Mo steels were investigated. Design/methodology/approach: The cooling rate determines the amount of martensite structure. Hardenability test was carried out by Jominy method.

Also the hardness and microstructures against the distances from quenched end are determined. Research limitations/implications: It is known that carbon has a marked the effect on hardenability of steel, but its use at higher levels is limited because lower toughness and increased probability of distortion and cracking during heat treatment and welding. Addition of manganese at low alloy steels is very useful for improvement of their hardenability.

40|$|The {{understanding}} of the hardenability is important in steel development with respect to weldability of steels {{as well as to}} the design of quenched and tempered steels. The common way to judge if steel is suitability to welding is the use of a carbon equivalent, which reflects the alloy content to the hardenability of the heat affected zone (HAZ). Most common of these equivalent is the IIW carbon equivalent wich has been in use for decades. However, this is an empirical equivalent, developed for CMn steels, and it doesn't say anything about the mechanical properties obtained in the HAZ. As a guideline a maximum HAZ hardness of 350 HV is normally put to avoid cold cracking in the HAZ. Numerous carbon equivalents have been published during the years, but few have been accepted and used. A drawnback of all these equivalents is that they have been evaluated for a set of chemical compositions which may be quite narrow, or that they have been evaluated on steels produced having other cleanliness, residual element levels etc. as is common in modern steelmarketing. The hardenability of steel designated to quenching and tempering is normally evaluated using either <b>Jominy</b> <b>testing</b> or using a calculation using the Grossmann formalism. As the hardenability described in the carbon equivalents used in welding and the hardenability of quenched and tempered steels using the Grossmann formalism are two different descriptions of the same phenomenon the aim of this thesis is to link these two formalisms together and use the knowledge from the HAZ hardenability to design quenched and tempered steels. The goal is to produce such steel grades having a much better weldability as compared with standard grades available at the market.

All specimens had undergone three different heat transfer mechanisms including film boiling mechanism, nucleate boiling mechanism and natural convection mechanism. Meanwhile, the cooling rate also had a distinct influence on the microstructure characteristics of ductile iron. The results of hardness test and microstructure observation indicated that the specimen austenitized at 830 °C had the most suitable hardness distribution, with high hardness on the quenching end and high toughness inside.

The test is carried out in the plant under actual conditions dispensing the need to correlate the standard cooling curve data and end quench hardenability tests done in the laboratory to industrial practice. To test the suite of mathematical models associated with the Reference QuenchProbe hardware and software, specimens of different grades of steels were instrumented with a single thermocouple near the surface of the specimen. Using the cooling data at the point of measurement, the cooling rates, microstructure, and hardness at other critical locations were computed. An enthalpy-based non-linear inverse heat conduction model was coupled with austenite decomposition models for handling the latent heat liberated during quenching. Several steels ranging from low carbon to medium alloy steels were both end-quenched by water and immersion quenched in several industrial quenchants. The computed hardness of end quenched and immersion quenched specimens were shown to be in good agreement with the measured values. The Reference QuenchProbe is thus shown to generate data needed for heat treatment process design including quenchant selection, which can be directly used in practice...|$|R
40|$|The {{measurement}} of acoustic properties {{can be used}} for the nondestructive characterization of the microstructure of materials. We have measured the changes in longitudinal acoustic wave velocity and acoustic attenuation in steel specimens whose microstructure and properties differ widely because of differing compositions and heat treatment. The spatial variation of the relative acoustic velocity in standard <b>Jominy</b> end-quench hardenability <b>test</b> specimens was found to correlate very well with Rockwell C hardness scans, indicating a potentially practical method for measuring the hardening response of heat treated steel. Absolute velocity measurements on steel specimens were found to be subject to random scatter related to minor compositional variations; this limits the utility of absolute velocity measurements for microstructural NDE. Attenuation measurements have also been performed on steel samples with different microstructures. The measurement utilized broadband acoustic pulses corrected for transducer response, liquid buffer/solid specimen reflection, and diffraction effects. Attenuation coefficients were seen to be proportional to frequency squared for martensite and to the fourth power of frequency for pearlite. Higher attenuation was observed for pearlitic than for martensitic microstructures...|$|R
40|$|In industry, {{the cost}} of {{production}} {{is an important factor}} and it is preferred to use conventional and low cost procedures for producing the parts. Heat treatment cycles and alloying additions are the key factors affecting the microstructure and mechanical properties of the cast steels. In this study an attempt was made to evaluate the influence of minor Mo addition on the microstructure and mechanical properties of conventionally heat treated cast micro-alloyed steels. The results of <b>Jominy</b> and dilatometry <b>tests</b> and also microstructural examinations revealed that Mo could effectively increase the hardenability of the investigated steel and change the microstructure features of the air-cooled samples. Acicular microstructure was the consequence of increasing the hardenability in Mo-added steel. Besides, it was found that Mo could greatly affect the isothermal bainitic transformation and higher fraction of martensite after cooling (from isothermal temperature) was due to the Mo addition. The results of impact test indicated that the microstructure obtained in air-cooled Mo-added steel led to better impact toughness (28 J) in comparison with the base steel (23 J). Moreover, Mo-added steel possessed higher hardness (291 HV), yield (524 MPa) and tensile (1108 MPa) strengths compared to the base one...|$|R
40|$|Selective Laser Melting (SLM) {{was used}} to develop a {{manufacturing}} route for high temperature aero-engine components from the Ni-superalloys CM 247 LC, focussing on improving the microstructure, mechanical properties, and processing route. A statistical design of experiments approach was applied to determine the optimum processing parameters leading to the least structural defects. High-speed imaging {{was used to}} observe the melt pool during SLM. Microstructural investigations showed that certain elements were selectively evaporated, then condensed {{in the form of}} particles. These were then re-incorporated within the build. Cracks and pores were found in SLM-processed samples and these were sometimes associated with these condensed particles. Residual stresses, developed within SLMprocessed samples, were measured using neutron diffraction, highlighting the role of the scanning strategy on the residual stress development. The solidification microstructures formed in SLM-processed samples were characterised using analytical scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Cells, with identical orientation and 700 nm in width containing a high density of very small γʹ (up to 20 nm), were observed. Cell boundaries and grain boundaries were found to contain high densities of dislocations, Hf/Ti/Ta/W-rich precipitates and γ/γʹ eutectic containing larger particles of γʹ up to about 50 nm. The cooling rate derived from the cell size was estimated at 106 K/s, but the cooling rate, derived from the size of γʹ within grains was estimated as 104 K/s based on <b>Jominy</b> end-quench <b>test.</b> SLM-processed samples also showed high yield strength due to their fine microstructures, alongside poor ductility resulting from the presence of cracks. Post-SLM heat treatments were used to reduce the extent of cracking and porosity by Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIPping) and also to promote the precipitation of γʹ. These treatments improve the ductility in vertically built samples, but the ductility in horizontally built samples remains low. Though SLM-processed samples subjected to post-processing heat treatments showed poor creep strength, this was improved by HIPping. A novel approach for netshape SLM/HIP processing was assessed for manufacturing a blisk using powder CM 247 LC or dual materials...|$|R
