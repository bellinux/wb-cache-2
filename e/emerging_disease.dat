5|$|In {{the early}} years of the 21st century {{epizootics}} in livestock caused by viruses continue to have serious consequences. Bluetongue disease, a disease caused by an orbivirus broke out in sheep in France in 2007.

5|$|White-nose {{syndrome}} (WNS) is an <b>emerging</b> <b>disease</b> in North American bats {{which by}} 2012 {{was associated with}} at least 5-7 million bat deaths.

5|$|The Blade started {{publishing}} weekly in January 1983 and coverage {{shifted to the}} AIDS crisis and news about this newly <b>emerging</b> <b>disease.</b> The ever-breaking news caused the paper to remain in a heightened state of coverage and nearly exhausted the papers resources {{with members of the}} community having to step in to support the work of the Blade. The reporting of the AIDS crisis from this timeframe allowed the newspaper to come of age to the mature and professionally driven publication seen today. In June 1988, the editors of the paper used a computer to layout the paper for the first time. The 1990s saw increases in readership and circulation of the Washington Blade. In April 1993, during the 1993 Gay March on Washington, the paper published its largest edition to date consisting of 216 pages. The paper expanded into new markets and mediums with the 1995 launch of the online version of the Blade, followed two years later with the launching of a sister publication in New York, called the New York Blade. In the later part of the century, coverage was expanded to include local and national news, as well as international news of interest to the LGBT community.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, <b>emerging</b> <b>diseases</b> {{were defined}} as being infectious, {{acquiring}} high incidence, often suddenly, or being a threat or an unexpected phenomenon. This study discusses the hallmarks of <b>emerging</b> <b>diseases,</b> describing the existence of noninfectious <b>emerging</b> <b>diseases,</b> and elaborating on the advantages of defining noninfectious <b>diseases</b> as <b>emerging</b> ones. From the discussion of various mental health disorders, nutritional deficiencies, external injuries and violence outcomes, work injuries and occupational health, and diseases due to environmental factors, the conclusion is drawn that {{a wide variety of}} noninfectious diseases can be defined as emergent. Noninfectious <b>emerging</b> <b>diseases</b> need to be identified in order to improve their control and management. A new definition of "emergent disease" is proposed, one that emphasizes the pathways of emergence and conceptual traits, rather than descriptive features...|$|R

These systems are based on syndromic surveillance with the notification of every case or of specific clinical syndromes or on the notification of atypical clinical cases. Data are entered by field veterinarians into forms available through Internet-accessible devices.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of this chapter are {{to analyze the}} construction of a new nosological category, of the (re) <b>emerging</b> <b>diseases,</b> and to examine two of the most relevant questions concerning the implications of (re) <b>emerging</b> <b>diseases</b> for public health, food security, and human development on a worldwide scale. The autor focuses on the role that irresponsible use of biotechnological innovations by elements of the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, food, and agricultural industries has played, and is still playing, in triggering and spreading (re) <b>emerging</b> <b>diseases.</b> Then, by briefly looking back over the major "engagements" in the battle against the HIV/AIDS pandemic, it emphasizes a number of serious shortcomings, in terms of both focus and timing, in current global public health policies, as well as their disastrous implications with regard to the effects of the pandemic on sub-Saharan Africa.
