5|$|We want {{a man as}} {{chairman}} who will rule with an iron hand... Baseball has lacked a hand like that for years. It needs it now worse than ever. Therefore, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> object to appoint a big man to lead the new commission.|$|E
5|$|Suppose, {{a people}} rise in revolt. They cannot attack the {{abstract}} constitution or lead an army against proclamations and statutes...Civil disobedience {{has to be}} directed against the salt tax or the land tax or some other particular point — not that; that is our final end, but {{for the time being}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> aim, and we must shoot straight.|$|E

5|$|The {{general law}} {{of this land}} is in favour of the wager of battle, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> duty to {{pronounce}} the law as it is, and not as we may wish it to be. Whatever prejudices may exist therefore against this mode of trial, still {{as it is the}} law of the land, the Court must pronounce judgment for it.|$|E
5|$|The third book {{continues}} along {{a similar}} vein, condemning cosmetics {{on the grounds}} that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> souls, not our bodies, that we should seek to beautify. Clement also opposes the dyeing of men's hair and male depilation as effeminacy. He advises choosing one's company carefully, to avoid being corrupted by immoral people, and while arguing that material wealth is no sin in itself, it is too likely to distract one from the infinitely more important spiritual wealth which is found in Christ. The work finishes with selections of scripture supporting Clement's argument, and following a prayer, the lyrics of a hymn.|$|E
5|$|The fifth book {{returns to}} the subject of faith. Clement argues that truth, justice and {{goodness}} can be seen only by the mind, not the eye; faith is a way of accessing the unseeable. He stresses that knowledge of God can only be achieved through faith once one's moral faults have been corrected. This parallels Clement's earlier insistence that martyrdom can only be achieved by those who practice their faith in Christ through good deeds, not those who simply profess their faith. God transcends matter entirely, and thus the materialist cannot truly come to know God. Although Christ was God incarnate, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> spiritual, not physical comprehension of him which is important.|$|E

5|$|While {{the speech}} {{revolves}} around the life of Neaira, this is of little importance to {{the substance of the}} accusations. The details seem {{to be part of the}} speech in the hope that the salacious accusations will hide the weakness of Apollodorus' case. The accuracy of the evidence given in the speech has been questioned, and is known to contain both lies and inaccuracies. Despite this, the speech tells us much about the life of an accomplished hetaera, and is extremely valuable to historians as a source on women's lives in classical Greece. Indeed, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> most reliable extant source on prostitution in the classical world, and one of our best sources on women's lives and gender relations in general for the period.|$|E

But if, in case of flood or other accident, they shall be without a bridge, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> will that they provide a ferry-boat for the free transportation of pilgrims, and it shall be unlawful for any other person to keep any boat there for passengers, whether for hire or not.|$|E

25|$|In the 1980s, {{the issue}} of trade {{unionism}} {{was at the heart}} of the decision to support Solidarity in Poland in their party's literature. Likewise, during the Miner's Strike of 1984–5, the party walked a line between supporting the miners whilst simultaneously suggesting that they wouldn't and couldn't win: <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> job as socialists, then, to stand with our fellow workers in their necessary battles to defend themselves, but to point out at all times that the real victory to be achieved is the abolition of the wages system.|$|E
25|$|Many {{commentators}} have since rejected {{this understanding of}} Humean empiricism, stressing an epistemological (rather than a semantic) reading of his project. According to this opposing view, Hume's empiricism consisted in the idea that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> knowledge, and not our ability to conceive, that is restricted to what can be experienced. Hume thought that we can form beliefs about that which extends beyond any possible experience, through the operation of faculties such as custom and the imagination, but he was sceptical about claims to knowledge on this basis.|$|E
25|$|We do {{not discuss}} the anatomical, physiological, and mental {{characteristics}} of man considered as an individual; but {{we are interested in}} the diversity of these traits in groups of men found in different geographical areas and in different social classes. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>our</b> task to inquire into the causes that have brought about the observed differentiation, and to investigate the sequence of events that have led to the establishment of the multifarious forms of human life. In other words, we are interested in the anatomical and mental characteristics of men living under the same biological, geographical, and social environment, and as determined by their past.|$|E
