Anything without awareness tends to a goal {{under the guidance of}} one who is aware. This we call God (Note that <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> guide objects, in Thomas's view, the source of all our knowledge comes from God as well).|$|E
25|$|In Section II, Kant {{starts from}} scratch and {{attempts}} to move from popular moral philosophy to a metaphysics of morals. Kant begins Section II of the Groundwork by criticizing attempts to begin moral evaluation with empirical observation. He states that <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> take ourselves to be behaving morally, we cannot be at all certain that we are purely motivated by duty and not by inclinations. Kant observes that humans are quite good at deceiving themselves {{when it comes to}} evaluating their motivations for acting, and therefore even in circumstances where individuals believe themselves to be acting from duty, it is possible they are acting merely in accordance with duty and are motivated by some contingent desire. However, the fact that we see ourselves as often falling short of what morality demands of us indicates we have some functional concept of the moral law.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal {{exited the}} {{competition}} in the semi-finals against Middlesbrough. At Highbury, the setting for the first leg, Juninho scored the only goal of the tie. Arsenal's task of progressing was made more difficult after Keown was sent off in the second leg and Boudewijn Zenden doubled Middlesbrough's aggregate scoreline. Though Edu equalised for Arsenal on the night, Reyes' own goal earnt Middlesbrough the win. Wenger opined of the result: [...] "I don't think we deserved to lose; <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were down to 10 men we were running the game." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{extended}} {{and ran for}} 90minutes, {{as opposed to the}} usual 60minutes. Michael Ausiello of TVLine reported that the producers included two extra musical performances to fill the extended time slot. Series creator Ian Brennan stated that he believed the extension was granted as there were two songs which would otherwise have been cut for length. He welcomed the additional 24minutes of screen time, and commented: [...] "We're always desperately cutting down our episodes. <b>Even</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> write them, and then in the editing room we're always throwing away stuff that I really love to get it down to time. [...] It will be just really interesting content-wise for us [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|Andrew O'Hehir of Salon {{has called}} Drive a [...] "classic Los Angeles heist-gone-wrong story," [...] which, [...] "isn’t trying to outdo Bullitt or get the next {{assignment}} in The Fast and the Furious franchise". O'Hehir also noted homages to [...] "Roger Corman's B-movie aesthetic and the glossy Hollywood spectacles of Michael Mann". As a character study, Steven Zeitchik of the Los Angeles Times examined themes of [...] "loyalty, loneliness {{and the dark}} impulses that rise up <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> try our hardest to suppress them". Reuters Nick Vinocur noted a series of comic gore, resulting in [...] "a bizarre concoction...reminiscent of David Lynch's Mulholland Drive...Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, and [...] angst-laden love scenes {{that would not be}} out of place in a Scandinavian drama". Christopher Hawthorne, also from the Los Angeles Times, has compared it to the works of Walter Hill, John Carpenter, Nathanael West, J. G. Ballard, and Mike Davis. According to Refn, Drive is dedicated to filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky and includes shades of Jodorowsky's existentialism.|$|E
500|$|Obama's {{selections}} of Warren and Lowery to deliver prayers for the inaugural ceremony were controversial. Warren {{had a history}} of vocal opposition to same-sex marriage, and Lowery had a background as a civil rights activist. Neither Obama nor Warren made references during the inaugural program to issues of direct concern to the gay community. In the invocation, Warren asked for [...] "forgiveness for Americans 'when we fight each other' and 'civility in our attitudes <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> differ.'" [...] Warren mentioned Dr.MartinLuther King and Jesus in the invocation, and he concluded the invocation with the Lord's Prayer. Lowery used humor as he delivered the benediction. One of his messages was the statement that [...] "as we leave this mountaintop, help us {{to hold on to the}} spirit of fellowship and the oneness of our family." [...] Lowery concluded the benediction with a humorous message of anticipation for the day [...] "when brown can stick around, when yellow will be mellow, when the red man can get ahead man and when white would embrace what is right". Conservatives, including Rush Limbaugh decried Lowery's benediction, which quoted from [...] "Lift Every Voice and Sing" [...] (the [...] "Black National Anthem"), as racist, while Democrats disagreed. Another of Lowery's rhymes, [...] "When black will not be asked to get in back", borrowing (along with other lines in his conclusion) from the Big Bill Broonzy song [...] "Black, Brown and White", particularly offended the likes of Limbaugh who felt that Obama's ascension on that day symbolized the fact that America had come to that point already.|$|E

2500|$|Nazir-Ali {{has written}} and spoken {{on a number}} of bioethical issues {{including}} in vitro fertilisation, stem cell research, organ donation and assisted dying. Here he has generally supported the [...] "culture of life" [...] and warned against a [...] "culture of death". He has argued that human dignity is based on [...] "transcendental values" [...] and must be respected at all stages of human development, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> are not sure whether there is a person, {{on the basis of the}} precautionary principle.|$|E
2500|$|He refuted this {{assumption}} {{by showing that}} much of what we [...] "know" [...] about the world consists of complex attitudes or tendencies that make us lean towards one interpretation over another. He argued that, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> use explicit symbols, we are using them against an unconscious background of commonsense knowledge and that without this background our symbols cease to mean anything. This background, in Dreyfus' view, was not implemented in individual brains as explicit individual symbols with explicit individual meanings.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the ways}} to measure {{economic}} competitiveness is by comparing an extent of economic freedom that countries have, which as surveys show can also largely explain differences in economic well-being across the world. [...] Generally, countries with higher economic freedom have higher gross domestic product per capita and its growth rates, as well as better health care, education quality, environment protection, income equality, and happiness results. These trends of increasing prosperity are confirmed <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> compare these indicators within territories of countries.|$|E

2500|$|David Cesarani emphasises the improvised, {{haphazard}} {{nature of}} Nazi policies {{in response to}} changing war time conditions in his overview, Final Solution: The Fate Of The European Jews 1933-49 (2016). [...] "Cesarani provides telling examples", wrote Mark Roseman, [...] "of a lack of coherence and planning for the future in Jewish policy, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> would most expect it. The classic instance is the invasion of Poland in 1939, when {{not even the most}} elementary consideration had been given to what should happen to Poland’s Jews either in the shorter or longer term. Given that Poland was home to the largest Jewish population in the world, and that {{in a couple of years}} it would house the extermination camps, this is remarkable." ...|$|E
2500|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{his life}} Tennyson {{revealed}} that his [...] "religious beliefs also defied convention, leaning towards agnosticism and pandeism": Famously, he wrote in In Memoriam: [...] "There lives more faith in honest doubt, believe me, than in half the creeds." [...] In Maud, 1855, he wrote: [...] "The churches have killed their Christ". In [...] "Locksley Hall Sixty Years After," [...] Tennyson wrote: [...] "Christian love among the churches look'd the twin of heathen hate." [...] In his play, Becket, he wrote: [...] "We are self-uncertain creatures, and we may, Yea, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> know not, mix our spites and private hates with our defence of Heaven". Tennyson recorded in his Diary (p.127): [...] "I believe in Pantheism of a sort". His son's biography confirms that Tennyson was not an orthodox Christian, noting that Tennyson praised Giordano Bruno and Spinoza on his deathbed, saying of Bruno, [...] "His view of God is in some ways mine", in 1892.|$|E
2500|$|Zero-point {{energy has}} many {{observed}} physical consequences. It {{is important to}} note that zero-point energy is not merely an artefact of mathematical formalism that can, for instance, be dropped from a Hamiltonian by redefining the zero of energy, or by arguing that it is a constant and therefore has no effect on Heisenberg equations of motion without latter consequence. Indeed, such treatment could create a problem at a deeper, as of yet undiscovered, theory. For instance, in general relativity the zero of energy (i.e. the energy density of the vacuum) contributes to a cosmological constant of the type introduced by Einstein in order to obtain static solutions to his field equations. The zero-point energy density of the vacuum, due to all quantum fields, is extremely large, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> cut off the largest allowable frequencies based on plausible physical arguments. It implies a cosmological constant larger than the limits imposed by observation by about 120 orders of magnitude. This [...] "cosmological constant problem" [...] remains one of the greatest unsolved mysteries of physics.|$|E

2500|$|Don Everly {{claimed in}} a 2014 {{interview}} with the Los Angeles Times that {{he had given up}} smoking in the late 1960s and that Phil had stopped too but started again during their breakup and had continued until 2001. Don said that weak lungs ran in the family, as their father, Ike, had died of black lung disease. He admitted that he had lived [...] "a very difficult life" [...] with his brother and that he and Phil had become estranged once again in later years, something which was mainly attributed to [...] "their vastly different views on politics and life," [...] with the music being the one thing they shared closely, saying, [...] "it's almost like we could read each other's minds when we sang." [...] However, Don also stated he had not gotten over Phil's death, saying, [...] "I always thought about him every day, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> were not speaking to each other. It still just shocks me that he's gone." [...] Don added that he always firmly believed he would die before his brother, because he was older than Phil. In a 2016 interview Don said he was still coping with the loss of Phil and that he had kept some of his brother's ashes in his home. He added that he would pick up the ashes every morning and say [...] "good morning," [...] while admitting that it was a peculiar ritual.|$|E
2500|$|Victorian critics {{praised the}} poem and some {{examined}} {{aspects of the}} poem's background. John Sheppard, {{in his analysis of}} dreams titled On Dreams (1847), lamented Coleridge's drug use as {{getting in the way of}} his poetry but argued: [...] "It is probable, since he writes of having taken an 'anodyne,' that the 'vision in a dream' arose under some excitement of that same narcotic; but this does not destroy, even as to his particular case, the evidence for a wonderfully inventive action of the mind in sleep; for, whatever were the exciting cause, the fact remains the same". T. Hall Caine, in 1883 survey of the original critical response to Christabel and [...] "Kubla Khan", praised the poem and declared: [...] "It must surely be allowed that the adverse criticism on 'Christabel' and 'Kubla Khan' which is here quoted is outside all tolerant treatment, whether of raillery or of banter. It is difficult to attribute such false verdict to pure and absolute ignorance. <b>Even</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> make all due allowance for the prejudices of critics whose only possible enthusiasm went out to 'the pointed and fine propriety of Poe,' we can hardly believe that the exquisite art which is among the most valued on our possessions could encounter so much garrulous abuse without the criminal intervention of personal malignancy." [...] In a review of H. D. Traill's analysis of Coleridge in the [...] "English Men of Letters", an anonymous reviewer wrote in 1885 Westminster Review: [...] "Of 'Kubla Khan,' Mr. Traill writes: 'As to the wild dream-poem 'Kubla Khan,' it is hardly more than a psychological curiosity, and only that perhaps in respect of the completeness of its metrical form.' Lovers of poetry think otherwise, and listen to these wonderful lines as the voice of Poesy itself." ...|$|E
