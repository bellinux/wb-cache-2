40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} {{to determine the extent of}} hearing loss experienced by high school agriculture teachers in West Virginia, and the hearing conservation practices used by those teachers and their students. Data regarding teacher training and characteristics were collected and teachers were tested for auditory sensitivity. More than three-fourths of the teachers tested were found to have high frequency hearing loss. Most teachers had not received information in college concerning hearing conservation. More than a third never wear hearing protection in their school shops and only about five percent always do. More than half the teachers reported difficulty in getting students to use safety and health equipment, with safety glasses and hearing protection presenting the greatest problems. The authors suggest that hearing conservation instruction begin in teacher preparation programs and that intensive inservice programs be provided for current teachers. They further suggest that information regarding hearing conservation methods and practices be incorporated into appropriate units and lessons, and that hearing protection equipment be provided by the schools and routinely used by teachers and students.

40|$|People {{with light}} eyes {{are more prone}} to {{deafness}} after meningitis than those with dark eyes Bacterial meningitis is {{the most common cause of}} profound deafness acquired in childhood. Previously there have been no strong indicators of why some survivors of meningitis experience hearing loss whereas others recover fully. The link between pigmentation and <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>hearing</b> after exposure to ototoxic substances and noise is well documented. People with brown eyes are more likely to experience hearing loss after exposure to cisplatin. It is assumed that people with dark eyes also have more melanin in the inner ear than those with light eyes, and melanin causes the retention of ototoxic derivatives within the cochlea. 1 A higher melanin content in the cochlea also protects against the effects of noise; those with dark eyes are less likely to develop hearing loss associated with noise. <br/...|$|E

40|$|Hearing {{function}} {{was measured in}} normal dogs and in dogs with otitis using {{brainstem auditory evoked response}} testing. Data were obtained from 86 normal ears and from 105 ears with otitis, cntegorised into four degrees of severity. The data were analysed to illustrate the differences between the hearing function in the normal and abnormal ears and to estimate the degree of impairment associated with differing degrees of pathology. While severe hearing loss seemed to be present in the dogs with more severe otitis, only two individuals were identified as being totally deaf in the affected ears and no dogs were identified in which the cleaning and examination processes had caused <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>hearing</b> function.

40|$|Aims: To characterise the {{development}} of noise induced <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>hearing.</b> Methods: Hearing and noise exposure were prospectively monitored among a cohort of newly enrolled construction industry apprentices and a comparison group of graduate students, using standard pure tone audiometry and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). A total of 328 subjects (632 ears) were monitored annually an average of 3. 4 times. In parallel to these measures, noise exposure and hearing protection device (HPD) use were extensively monitored during construction work tasks. Recreational/non-occupational exposures also were queried and monitored in subgroups of subjects. Trade specific mean exposure Leq levels, with and without accounting for the variable use of hearing protection in each trade, were calculated and used to group subjects by trade specific exposure level. Mixed effects models were used to estimate the change in hearing outcomes over time for each exposure group. Results: Small but significant exposure related changes in DPOAEs over time were observed, especially at 4 kHz with stimulus levels (L 1) between 50 and 75 dB, with less clear but similar patterns observed at 3 kHz. After controlling for covariates, the high exposure group had annual changes in 4 kHz emissions of about 0. 5 dB per year.

40|$|AbstractSeismic {{surveys are}} widely used in marine {{geophysical}} oil and gas exploration, employing airguns to produce sound-waves capable of penetrating the sea floor. In recent years, concerns have been raised over the biological impacts of this activity, particularly for marine mammals. While exploration occurs {{in the waters of}} at least fifty countries where marine turtles are present, the degree of threat posed by seismic surveys is almost entirely unknown. To investigate this issue, a mixed-methods approach involving a systematic review, policy comparison and stakeholder analysis was employed and recommendations for future research were identified. This study found that turtles have been largely neglected both in terms of research and their inclusion in mitigation policies. Few studies have investigated the potential for seismic surveys to cause behavioural changes or physical damage, indicating a crucial knowledge gap. Possible ramifications for turtles include exclusion from critical habitats, <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>hearing</b> and entanglement in seismic survey equipment. Despite this, the policy comparison revealed that only three countries worldwide currently include turtles in their seismic mitigation guidelines and very few of the measures they specify are based on scientific evidence or proven effectiveness. Opinions obtained from stakeholder groups further highlight the urgent need for directed, in-depth empirical research to better inform and develop appropriate mitigation strategies. As seismic surveying is becoming increasingly widespread and frequent, it is important and timely that we evaluate the extent to which marine turtles, a taxon of global conservation concern, may be affected...|$|E

40|$|The article {{summarizes}} the data obtained in long-term research on working conditions estimates and studying <b>damages</b> <b>to</b> <b>hearing</b> organs in workers employed at petrochemical plants. We chose workers employed at five basic organic synthesis productions {{as an object}} of our study; these productions include ethylene-propylene, ethylbenzene-styrene, organic alcohols production (butanol and 2 -ethylhexanol), phthalic anhydride. We detected that heating furnaces, compressors, and pumps were the main noise sources at the examined productions. Our research revealed that noise levels at the examined productions varied from 60 to 99 decibel, and calculated equivalent noise levels reached the 3 hazard class with 1 st and 2 nd hazard degree. Audiometric research showed that signs of impacts exerted by noise on hearing organs of workers belonging to basic occupational groups (processing machine operators and pumps and compressor operators) occurred authentically more frequently than in case of control equipment mechanics and automatic equipment operators (comparison group) (< 0, 001). The highest risk of occupational hearing loss was detected for drivers while the same pathology evolved 1. 5 – 2. 0 times less frequently in processing machines operators. Frequency of hearing organs damage in all basic occupational groups authentically increased as working period grew. Signs of such damage increased dramatically in processing machines operators' group after 10 years of work but still the overall level was slightly lower than in drivers' group. It is shown that the most efficient measures of collective protection aimed at noise reduction are application of low-noise technological equipment, acoustic protection (sound insulation and sound absorption, etc), remote control, as well as rational labor and leisure regime. Medical care and vocational rehabilitation of people with occupational hearing loss also contribute significantly into sensory deafness prevention. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{addition}} to deteriorating {{the quality of}} life of the local residents, there are some major envi-ronmental impacts that can be generated by the operation of a stone quarry in the vicinity of the Bay of Fundy. Detonation of explosives near water creates compression waves that produce a rapid rise in the peak pressure and its rapid decay to the ambient pressure. This can damage the swim bladder of fish and damage their eggs/larvae. Large whales orient to objects by passively listening to underwater noise. Their exposure to the intense noise generated by blasting near the shoreline may result in <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>hearing</b> and subsequent death by accidents. Sedimentation resulting from blasting, grinding and wash-ing of the aggregate may cover spawning areas or reduce bottom dwelling life forms that the fish use for food. The explosive residue may pollute the groundwater and may be toxic to aquatic life. Groundwater will be drawn down from upstream of the quarry as a result of excavation with the potential for lower-ing the water table and drying up the wells in the neighbourhood, as well as reducing the base flow in local streams. If the aggregate produced from the quarry is to be shipped across the Bay of Fundy, the new invasive plants brought in by ballast water may displace existing plant life (such as kelp beds and rockweed) and provide inhospitable environments for critical marine species...|$|E

The acceptance of the noise for the citizens, living in the vicinity of railway lines, is of vital importance in view of the increasing number of trains and consequently of the noise they produce. Therefore, measures to reduce the noise levels are essential to prevent health risks in the citizens exposed. Health effects due to prolonged exposure to environmental noise, rarely can cause directly <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>hearing</b> (hearing loss). Many damages psychosomatic, can affect the apparatus: digestive, respiratory, visual, reproductive, skin and circulatory systems and blood. Precisely for these reasons, in recent decades the actions of assessment and reduction of noise, coming from the civil engineering infrastructure, have become of paramount importance and cannot longer be neglected.

In order to do this a working knowledge of sound moderators and suppressors is considered vital in order to assess their capabilities and optimise their performance. The project looks at a theoretical model of an integral suppressor for a modified 12 bore shotgun. The model was used to determine the area of holes through the barrel, allowing gas into the suppressor, has the greatest effect on the pressure within the suppressor. It was found that the volume of the suppressor and position of the hole through the barrel did not have such a significant effect on the pressure. The theoretical work was supported by experimental trials which confirmed the barrel hole size has a significant effect on the pressure. The experimental work also showed for the low pressure system the hole size through the baffles did not {{have a significant effect on}} the pressure. Work was carried out to establish whether current practice for proofing suppressors was sufficient. The results show that proof rounds give a lower pressure in an external suppressor than standard ammunition. Tests on improvised suppressors showed they are effective and allowed a visual analysis on suppressors. Baffles were shown to be advantageous in a suppressor configuration.
