5|$|According to Herodotus, the Allies {{spent the}} evening heatedly debating their course of action. The Peloponnesians were {{in favour of}} evacuating, {{and at this point}} Themistocles {{attempted}} his ruse with Xerxes. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>when</b> Aristides, the exiled Athenian general arrived that night, followed by some deserters from the Persians, with news of the deployment of the Persian fleet, that the Peloponnesians accepted that they could not escape, and so would fight.|$|E
5|$|Kulintang {{music was}} also crucial in {{relation}} to courtships due to {{the very nature of}} Islamic custom, which did not allow for unmarried men and women to intermingle. Traditionally, unmarried daughters were kept in a special chamber in the attic called a lamin, off-limit to visitors and suitors. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>when</b> she was allowed to play during kulintang performances that suitors were allowed to view her. Because of this, kulintang music was rare socially approved vehicles for interaction among the sexes.|$|E
5|$|After Æthelstan's death, {{the men of}} York {{immediately}} {{chose the}} Viking king of Dublin, Olaf Guthfrithson (or his cousin, Anlaf Cuaran), as their king, and Anglo-Saxon control of the north, seemingly made safe by the victory of Brunanburh, collapsed. The reigns of Æthelstan's half-brothers Edmund (939–946) and Eadred (946–955) were largely devoted to regaining control. Olaf seized the east midlands, leading {{to the establishment of}} a frontier at Watling Street. In 941 Olaf died, and Edmund took back control of the east midlands, and then York in 944. Following Edmund's death York again switched back to Viking control, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>when</b> the Northumbrians finally drove out their Norwegian Viking king Eric Bloodaxe in 954 and submitted to Eadred that Anglo-Saxon control of the whole of England was finally restored.|$|E

5|$|Cleph {{kept his}} throne for only 18 months before being assassinated by a slave. An {{important}} {{success for the}} Byzantines was that no king was proclaimed to succeed him, opening a decade of interregnum and making the Lombards who remained in Italy more vulnerable to attacks from Franks and Byzantines. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>when</b> faced with the danger of annihilation by the Franks in 584 that the Lombard dukes elected a new king {{in the person of}} Authari, son of Cleph, who began the definitive consolidation and centralization of the Lombard kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Hancock {{was born}} on 31May 1907 in Perth, Western Australia, and educated at Hale School in Wembley Downs. He was the elder cousin of future mining magnate Lang Hancock. Val Hancock entered the Royal Military College, Duntroon, in 1925 and {{graduated}} as senior cadet in 1928, earning the Sword of Honour. His preferred career path in the military was engineering, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>when</b> he {{found that there was}} no vacancy in his corps of choice, and that he had instead been earmarked for the artillery, that he put his name forward for transfer to the Royal Australian Air Force. He enlisted in the RAAF on 1February 1929, and undertook flying instruction at RAAF Point Cook, Victoria, later that year.|$|E
5|$|Lord Kelvin used {{thermodynamics}} {{to estimate}} the age of Earth to be between 20 million and 400 million years in 1864, sparking a vigorous debate on the subject; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>when</b> radioactivity and radioactive dating were discovered in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that a reliable mechanism for determining Earth's age was established, proving the planet to be billions of years old.

After missing the {{official}} application period, he only entered after a friendly high-ranking motorsport functionary from Graz intervened on his behalf. During the race, {{he was black}} flagged for his dangerous driving style and therefore disqualified; he did not immediately return to the pit lane as {{he was unaware of}} the regulations. Rindt entered several rallies with his Simca but did not achieve good results. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>when</b> he was provided with a race-prepared Alfa Romeo GT 1300 at cost price and with free servicing by a local dealer that he became more successful.

5|$|Cleph {{kept the}} throne for only 18 months before being assassinated by a slave. Possibly {{he too was}} killed at the {{instigation}} of the Byzantines, who had every interest in avoiding a hostile and solid leadership among the Lombards. An important success for the Byzantines was that no king was proclaimed to succeed Cleph, opening a decade of interregnum, thus making them more vulnerable to attacks from Franks and Byzantines. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>when</b> faced with the danger of annihilation by the Franks in 584 that the dukes elected a new king {{in the person of}} Authari, son of Cleph, who began the definitive consolidation and centralization of the Lombard kingdom while the remaining imperial territories were reorganized under the control of an exarch in Ravenna with the capacity to defend the country without the Emperor's assistance.|$|E
5|$|The chronicle {{records that}} in 1228, while Óláfr and his chiefs were away from Mann, {{the island was}} {{attacked}} and devastated by Alan, his brother Thomas, Earl of Atholl (d. 1231), and Rögnvaldr. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>when</b> Alan left with most of his force that Óláfr was able {{to regain control of}} the island. Rögnvaldr sailed from Galloway in the winter of the same year, landed on Mann, and burnt all the ships of Óláfr and his chiefs. The chronicle states that Rögnvaldr stayed at Ronaldsway for forty days; and that he won over the hearts of the southern inhabitants of the island. Óláfr and his forces arrived at Tynwald on 14 February 1229, where they attacked Rögnvaldr and his men. The chronicle claims that Rögnvaldr was treacherously killed by his own men, without the prior knowledge of Óláfr, and also notes that Óláfr never avenged his half-brother's death.|$|E

5|$|The ships {{headed for}} Batavia in the Dutch East Indies. Fearing the Japanese Navy, {{they sought to}} travel via the Lingga Islands hoping that the island group it sat in {{could be used as}} a hiding place. As they {{approached}} on 14 February, Judy indicated the approach of Japanese aircraft and the anti-aircraft gunners took up their positions in readiness. The Grasshopper was hit with a single bomb before the planes departed. Judy was below decks when the planes returned. The Dragonfly was hit by three bombs and sank quickly. The Grasshopper was hit by a further two bombs, and the order was given to abandon ship as a fire spread close to an ammunition compartment. Boats were lowered and the crew and evacuees were ferried just over a hundred yards to shore whilst the Japanese planes strafed the vessels. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>when</b> they were ashore that they realised Judy was not with them.|$|E
5|$|They {{finished}} 8–3 in 1941, {{and held}} a ceremony to honor the future Hall of Famer Leemans in the final regular season game on December 7, 1941. Leemans {{had been with the}} Giants since 1936, when he led the league in rushing as a rookie with 830yards. A versatile performer, he rushed for over 3,000yards, and passed for over 2,300 in his career. During the course of the game the stadium announcer paged Colonel William Joseph Donovan to answer a call from Washington, D.C., and told all servicemen to return to their units, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>when</b> the game concluded that players and spectators learned of the attack on the naval base at Pearl Harbor earlier that day. New York advanced to the championship game following the season, in which they lost to the Bears 37–9. Both the 1940 and 1941 championship games were close early before their respective opponents went on an offensive surge to break the games open late. In 1942 and 1943, the Giants totalled an 11–8–2 record and failed to make the postseason.|$|E
5|$|His view (part of a {{tradition}} {{that goes back to}} J. J. Müller, who advanced Marius' claims as early as 1870, and supported by modern scholars such as André Chastagnol) was vigorously contested by Ronald Syme, who theorized that virtually all the identifiable citations from Marius Maximus are essentially frivolous interpolations into the main narrative source, which he postulated was a different Latin author whom he styled 'Ignotus ("the unknown one"), the good biographer'. His theory argued, firstly, that as Marius wrote a sequel to the Lives of the Twelve Caesars, his work covered the reigns from Nerva to Elagabalus; consequently, this would not have included a biography of Lucius Verus, even though the biography of that Princeps in the History is mainly of good quality. Secondly, that 'Ignotus' only went up to Caracalla, as is revealed by the inferior and mostly fictitious biography of Macrinus. Finally, that the composer of the Historia Augusta wrote the lives of the emperors through to the Life of Caracalla (including Lucius Verus) using Ignotus as his main source, and supplementing with Marius Maximus on occasion. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>when</b> the source failed that he turned to other less reliable sources (such as Herodian and Maximus), as well as his own fertile imagination, and it was at this juncture that he composed the first five minor lives, through to the Life of Geta.|$|E

5|$|On 23 April, a heavy storm {{swept the}} Eastern Atlantic, {{striking}} Warren's squadron and their prizes. Marengo was seriously damaged, losing all three masts and {{taking on a}} large quantity of water {{that had to be}} pumped overboard by the understrength crew working in shifts. Five men were drowned. Ramilles also suffered in the high winds, losing almost all her masts and rolling for some hours, completely out of control. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>when</b> the storm had abated that jury masts could be raised and the scattered ships could rejoin the squadron for its journey back to Britain, arriving at Spithead. Willaumez eventually returned to the North Atlantic in the early summer, passing through the Caribbean before being dispersed in a hurricane, his ships scattered across the Western Atlantic. Most eventually reached France, but the campaign had been another disaster for the French Navy, with {{less than half of the}} ships sent out returning to Brest. The loss of Marengo and Belle Poule formed a footnote to the campaign, but the defeat of Linois was widely celebrated in Britain, where both ships were commissioned into the Royal Navy under their French names. Linois was praised for his defence of his ship in the face of overwhelming British force, and historian William James, writing in 1827, considered that had Linois faced London alone he might have had the advantage. Four decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the Naval General Service Medal, awarded upon application to all British participants from London and Amazon still living in 1847.|$|E
