5|$|The body wall {{consists}} of a cuticle, an epidermis and longitudinal and circular bands of muscle fibres. In some primitive species, each <b>epidermal</b> <b>cell</b> has a single cilium, a feature shared only by the gnathostomulans. The whole ventral surface of the animal may be ciliated or the cilia may be arranged in rows, patches or transverse bands. The cuticle is locally thickened in some gastrotrichs and forms scales, hooks and spines. There is no coelom (body cavity) and {{the interior of the}} animal is filled with poorly differentiated connective tissue. In the macrodasyidans, Y-shaped cells, each containing a vacuole, surround the gut and may function as a hydrostatic skeleton.|$|E
5|$|The {{reproductive}} {{stage of}} the insect is the winged adult or imago. The surface of both butterflies and moths is covered by scales, {{each of which is}} an outgrowth from a single <b>epidermal</b> <b>cell.</b> The head is small and dominated by the two large compound eyes. These are capable of distinguishing flower shapes or motion but not for clearly viewing distant objects. Colour perception is good, especially in some species in the blue/violet range. The antennae are composed of many segments and have clubbed tips (unlike moths that have tapering or feathery antennae). The sensory receptors are concentrated in the tips and can detect odours. Taste receptors are located on the palps and on the feet. The mouthparts are designed for sucking and the mandibles are usually reduced in size or absent. The first maxillae are elongated into a tubular proboscis which is curled up at rest and expanded when needed to feed. The first and second maxillae bear palps which function as sensory organs. Some species have a reduced proboscis or maxillary palps and do not feed as adults.|$|E

Large inter-individual variations are found in the basal and induced arylhydrocarbon-hydroxylase activities. 2) UV-in-duced unscheduled DNA synthesis was demonstrated in human <b>epidermal</b> <b>cells</b> on autoradiographs. We also found that DNA repair is defective in <b>epidermal</b> <b>cells</b> isolated from xeroderma pigmentosum by a new explant-outgrowth culture. 3) Human <b>epidermal</b> <b>cells</b> are unique in that there is a large number of binding sites to phorbol esters compared with mouse <b>epidermal</b> <b>cells,</b> but there is no down-regulation. Further, human <b>epidermal</b> <b>cells</b> show essentially negative responses to tumor promoters, i. e., no stimulation of DNA synthesis, sugar uptake, and no induction of ornithine decarboxylase activity. 4) Human <b>epidermal</b> <b>cells</b> contain 1. 5 × 105 binding sites per <b>cell</b> for <b>epidermal</b> growth factor (EGF), whereas squamous cell carcinomas of skin and oral cavity have larger amounts of EGF receptors in the order of 106 per cell. 5) Based on the above results, we attempted to transform human <b>epidermal</b> <b>cells</b> by the treatment with chemical carcinogens, but until now no transformation was obtained.

40|$|Histochemical and {{biochemical}} {{techniques have}} been used to compare the effects of dibutyryl cyclic AMP on <b>epidermal</b> <b>cells</b> and dermal cells in primary tissue culture.

Dibutyryl cyclic AMP had no significant effect on leucine and phenylalanine incorporation.

40|$|Exposure {{to certain}} allergens via {{epithelial}} tissues {{is the primary}} route for tile induction of immunoglobulin E–dependent allergies of the immediate type associated with atopic diseases. In order {{to address the question}} whether and how epithelial cells might contribute to the induction or increase of TH 2 -dependent IgE production, we performed co-culture experiments of syngeneic <b>epidermal</b> <b>cells</b> and cells from the associated lymphoid tissue or spleen (responder cells) of BALB/c mice primed with ovalbumin in vivo. In the presence of ovalbumin in vitro, immunoglobulin E but not immunoglobulin G 2 a production was significantly enhanced by the addition of <b>epidermal</b> <b>cells,</b> and separation of <b>epidermal</b> <b>cells</b> from responder cells by a membrane that prevented cellular contacts or addition of antibodies against intercellular adhesion molecule– 1 reduced the enhancement of immunoglobulin E production induced by <b>epidermal</b> <b>cells.</b> Depletion of major histocompatability complex class II+ antigen presenting Langerhans <b>cells</b> from the <b>epidermal</b> <b>cells</b> prior to co-culture also reduced the enhancement of immunoglobulin E production induced by <b>epidermal</b> <b>cells.</b> The enhanced immunoglobulin E production was dependent on the induction of TH 2 cell–derived interleukin- 4 detected in co-cultures because it was completely inhibited after addition of anti–interleukin- 4 antibodies that also lead to increased immunoglobulin G 2 a production.

40|$|Five {{kinds of}} {{monoclonal}} antibodies that are specific for the epidermis of Xenopus embryos were produced. Epidermis-specific antibodies {{were used to}} investigate the spatial and temporal expressions of epidermal antigens during embryonic and larval development. The cells that were recognized by the antibodies at the larval stage are as follows: all of the outer <b>epidermal</b> <b>cells</b> and cement gland cells were recognized by the antibody termed XEPI- 1, all of the outer and inner <b>epidermal</b> <b>cells,</b> except the cement gland cells, were recognized by XEPI- 2 antibody, the large mucus granules and the apical side of the outer <b>epidermal</b> <b>cells,</b> except for the ciliated <b>epidermal</b> <b>cells,</b> were recognized by XEPI- 3 antibody, the large mucus granules and basement membrane were recognized by XEPI- 4 antibody, and the small mucus granules contained in the outer <b>epidermal</b> <b>cells</b> as well as extracellular matrices were recognized by the anti-body termed XEPI- 5. All of the epidermal antigens, except XEPI- 4, were first detected in the epidermal region of the late gastrula or early ncurula. The XEPI- 4 antigen was first detected in stage- 26 tail-bud embryos. None of these antigens were expressed by the neural tissues {{at any time during}} embryonic develop-ment. Only the XEPI- 2 antigen continued to be expressed after metamorphosis, while the expression of the other antigens disappeared during or before metamorphosis.

40|$|Skin {{wound healing}} is a {{critical}} and complex biological process after trauma. This process is activated by signaling pathways of both epithelial and nonepithelial cells, which release a myriad of different cytokines and growth factors. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a cytokine known to play multiple roles during the various stages of wound healing. This study evaluated the benefits of HGF on reepithelialization during wound healing and investigated its mechanisms of action. Gross and histological results showed that HGF significantly accelerated reepithelialization in diabetic (DB) rats. HGF increased the expressions of the cell adhesion molecules β 1 -integrin and the cytoskeleton remodeling protein integrin-linked kinase (ILK) in <b>epidermal</b> <b>cells</b> in vivo and in vitro. Silencing of ILK gene expression by RNA interference reduced expression of β 1 -integrin, ILK, and c-met in <b>epidermal</b> <b>cells,</b> concomitantly decreasing the proliferation and migration ability of <b>epidermal</b> <b>cells.</b> β 1 -Integrin {{can be an important}} maker of poorly differentiated <b>epidermal</b> <b>cells.</b> Therefore, these data demonstrate that <b>epidermal</b> <b>cells</b> become poorly differentiated state and regained some characteristics of <b>epidermal</b> stem <b>cells</b> under the role of HGF after wound.
