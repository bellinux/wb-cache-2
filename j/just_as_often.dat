5|$|Augustus' {{powers were}} now complete. In fact, he dated his 'reign' from the {{completion}} of the Second Settlement, July 1, 23 BC. Almost as importantly, the Principate now had constitutional stability. Later Roman Emperors were generally limited to the powers and titles originally granted to Augustus, though often newly appointed Emperors would decline {{one or more of the}} honorifics given to Augustus in order to display humility. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>often,</b> as their reign progressed, Emperors would appropriate all of the titles, regardless of whether they had been granted them by the Senate. Later Emperors took to wearing the civic crown, consular insignia, and the purple robes of a Triumphant general (toga picta), which became the imperial insignia well into the Byzantine era.|$|E

25|$|When the testis {{is in the}} abdomen, {{the first}} stage of surgery is {{exploration}} to locate it, assess its viability, and determine the safest way to maintain or establish the blood supply. Multi-stage surgeries, or autotransplantation and anastomosis, are more often necessary in these situations. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> <b>often,</b> intra-abdominal exploration discovers that the testis is non-existent ("vanished"), or dysplastic and not salvageable.|$|E

25|$|Dede {{has been}} criticised by Turkish music purists {{for not being}} steeped in the Sufi traditions and for not {{properly}} representing Sufism in his music and writings.

However, {{as more than a}} ney player, working <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>often</b> as a DJ as performing live in concert, with an audience consisting of clubbers, not Islamic scholars, Dede aims to synthesise several different traditions rather than recreate a historically pure music.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{after the}} First Crusade, land was {{distributed}} to loyal vassals of Godfrey, forming numerous feudal lordships within the kingdom. This was continued by Godfrey's successors. The number {{and importance of}} the lordships varied throughout the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and many cities {{were part of the}} royal domain. The king was assisted by a number of officers of state. The king and the royal court were normally located in Jerusalem, but due to the prohibition on Muslim inhabitants, the capital was small and underpopulated. The king <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>often</b> held court at Acre, Nablus, Tyre, or wherever else he happened to be. In Jerusalem, the royal family lived firstly on the Temple Mount, before the foundation of the Knights Templar, and later in the palace complex surrounding the Tower of David; there was another palace complex in Acre.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{creation}} of the Pike Place Market in 1907, local Seattle area farmers sold their goods to the public in a three-square block area called The Lots, located at Sixth Avenue and King Street. Most produce sold at The Lots would then be brought to commercial wholesale houses on Western Avenue, which became known as Produce Row. Most farmers, due to the amount of time required to work their farms, were forced to sell their produce on consignment through the wholesalers on Western Avenue. The farmers typically received a percentage of the final sale price for their goods. They would sell to the middleman on commission, as most farmers would often have no time to sell direct to the public, and their earnings would be on marked up prices and expected sales. In some cases, the farmers made a profit, but <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>often</b> found themselves breaking even, or getting no money at all due to the business practices of the wholesalers. During the existence of the wholesale houses, which far predated the Market, there were regular rumors as well as instances of corruption in denying payment to farmers.|$|E

500|$|Pilot {{whale meat}} is {{available}} for consumption in very few areas of Japan, mainly along the central Pacific coast, and also {{in other areas of}} the world, such as the Faroe Islands. The meat is high in protein (higher than beef) and low in fat. [...] Because a whale's fat is contained in the layer of blubber beneath the skin, and the muscle is high in myoglobin, the meat is a dark shade of red. In Japan, where pilot whale meat can be found in certain restaurants and izakayas, the meat is sometimes served raw, as sashimi, but <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>often</b> pilot whale steaks are marinated, cut into small chunks, and grilled.

500|$|Despite {{their low}} status, some retiarii became quite popular {{throughout}} the early Empire. The fact that spectators could see net-fighters' faces humanised them and probably added to their popularity. At Pompeii, graffiti tells of Crescens or Cresces the retiarius, [...] "lord of the girls" [...] and [...] "doctor to nighttime girls, morning girls, {{and all the}} rest." [...] Evidence suggests that some homosexual men fancied gladiators, and the retiarius would have been particularly appealing. Roman art depicts net-men <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>often</b> as other types. A mosaic found in 2007 in a bathhouse at the Villa dei Quintili shows a retiarius named Montanus. The fact that his name is recorded indicates that the gladiator was famous. The mosaic dates to c.

In modern times, popular culture has made the retiarius probably the most famous type of gladiator.|$|E
500|$|Pre-dreadnoughts {{also carried}} a {{secondary}} battery. This consisted of smaller guns, typically , though any calibre from 4 to 9.4inches (100 to 240mm) could be used. Virtually all secondary guns were [...] "quick firing", employing {{a number of}} innovations to increase the rate of fire. The propellant was provided in a brass cartridge, and both the breech mechanism and the mounting were suitable for rapid aiming and reloading. [...] The role of the secondary battery was to damage the less armoured parts of an enemy battleship; while unable to penetrate the main armour belt, it might score hits on lightly armoured areas like the bridge, or start fires. Equally important, the secondary armament was to be used against enemy cruisers, destroyers, and even torpedo boats. A medium-calibre gun could expect to penetrate the light armour of smaller ships, while the rate of fire of the secondary battery was important in scoring a hit against a small, manoeuvrable target. Secondary guns were mounted {{in a variety of}} ways; sometimes carried in turrets, they were <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>often</b> positioned in fixed armoured casemates {{in the side of the}} hull, or in unarmoured positions on upper decks.|$|E
500|$|The {{fin whale}} is {{brownish}} to dark or light gray dorsally and white ventrally. The {{left side of}} the head is dark gray, while the right side exhibits a complex pattern of contrasting light and dark markings. On the right lower jaw is a white or light gray [...] "right mandible patch", which sometimes extends out as a light [...] "blaze" [...] laterally and dorsally unto the upper jaw and back to just behind the blowholes. Two narrow dark stripes originate from the eye and ear, the former widening into a large dark area on the shoulder— these are separated by a light area called the [...] "interstripe wash". These markings are more prominent on individuals in the North Atlantic than in the North Pacific, where they can appear indistinct. The left side exhibits similar but much fainter markings. Dark, oval-shaped areas of pigment called [...] "flipper shadows" [...] extend below and posterior to the pectoral fins. This type of asymmetry is seen in Omura's whale and occasionally in minke whales. It was thought to have evolved because the whale swims on its right side when surface lunging and it sometimes circles to the right while at the surface above a prey patch. However, the whales <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>often</b> circle to the left. No accepted hypothesis explains the asymmetry.|$|E
