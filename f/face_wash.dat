40|$|Face {{cleanliness}} is a {{core component}} of the SAFE (Surgery, Antibiotics, Facial cleanliness, and Environmental improvements) strategy for trachoma control. Understanding knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to <b>face</b> <b>washing</b> may be helpful for designing effective interventions for improving facial cleanliness. In April 2014, a mixed methods study including focus groups and a quantitative cross-sectional {{study was conducted in}} the East Gojjam zone of the Amhara region of Ethiopia. Participants were asked about <b>face</b> <b>washing</b> practices, motivations for <b>face</b> <b>washing,</b> use of soap (which may reduce bacterial load), and fly control strategies. Overall, both knowledge and reported practice of <b>face</b> <b>washing</b> was high. Participants reported they knew that <b>washing</b> their own <b>face</b> and their children's faces daily was important for hygiene and infection control. Although participants reported high knowledge of the importance of soap for <b>face</b> <b>washing,</b> quantitative data revealed strong variations by community in the use of soap for <b>face</b> <b>washing,</b> ranging from 4. 4 % to 82. 2 % of households reporting using soap for <b>face</b> <b>washing.</b> Cost and forgetfulness were cited as barriers to the use of soap for <b>face</b> <b>washing.</b> Keeping flies from landing on children was a commonly cited motivator for regular <b>face</b> <b>washing,</b> as was trachoma prevention. Interventions aiming to improve facial cleanliness for trachoma prevention should focus on habit formation (to address forgetfulness) and address barriers to the use of soap, such as reducing cost. Interventions that focus solely on improving knowledge may not be effective for changing face-washing behaviors...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{investigated the}} effect of contingent food deliveries on grooming movements in rats. The grooming sequence was divided into three topographically distinct behaviors: paw <b>washing,</b> <b>face</b> <b>washing,</b> and body washing. The first experiment found that rates of paw washing and body washing increased reliably under a food contingency, but <b>face</b> <b>washing</b> did not. A second experiment replicated these findings, and, in addition, showed that the average duration of paw washing and body washing decreased in length when followed by food. Placing a contingency on <b>face</b> <b>washing,</b> however, produced {{an increase in the}} rate of paw washing but no increase in <b>face</b> <b>washing.</b> It was concluded that, on the one hand, paw washing and body washing may be influenced by operant contingencies {{in the same way as}} behaviors such as lever pressing. On the other hand, increases in paw <b>washing</b> under the <b>face</b> <b>washing</b> contingency suggested that increases in the rate of grooming movements may occur by means other than operant relations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background <b>Face</b> <b>washing</b> is {{important}} to interrupt the transmission of trachoma, the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide. We aimed to assess the household and personal factors that affected water use and <b>face</b> <b>washing</b> practices in Kongwa, Tanzania. Methods We conducted a household water use survey in 173 households (329 children) in January, 2010. Self reported data on water use practices, observed water in the household, and observed clean faces in children were collected. Contingency table analyses and logistic regression analyses were used to measure associations between unclean faces and risk factors. Results We found that women are recognized as primary decision makers on water use in a household, and respondents who reported laziness as a reason that others do not <b>wash</b> children's <b>faces</b> {{were significantly more likely}} to have children with clean <b>faces.</b> <b>Washing</b> was reported as a priority for water use in most households. Sixty four percent (95 % Confidence Interval = 59 %- 70 %) of children had clean faces. Conclusions Attitudes toward <b>face</b> <b>washing</b> and household water use appear to have changed dramatically from 20 years ago when clean faces were rare and men made decisions on water use in households. The sources of these attitudinal changes are not clear, but are positive changes that will assist the trachoma control program in strengthening its hygiene efforts. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: Trachoma is {{the leading}} {{infectious}} cause of blindness worldwide. Active trachoma {{is caused by the}} bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis. Recurrent infection over many years may lead to scarring of the conjunctiva, entropion, trachomatous trichiasis and corneal opacity. Objective: To summarize Cochrane reviews that assess the effect of SAFE strategy (surgery, antibiotics, <b>face</b> <b>washing</b> and environmental change) for trachoma in developing countries. Methods: The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was searched for any intervention to prevent or treat trachoma. Data was extracted in duplicate and analyzed. Main Results: There were four systematic reviews addressing trachoma, all of which met the inclusion criteria. There was some evidence that the prevalence of active trachoma was reduced by the use of antibiotics. At three months, six of nine trials found a significant reduction in relative risk of active trachoma in the intervention groups. At 12 months, only three of six studies found a significant reduction. Oral azithromycin performed better than topical tetracycline at clearing infection at three months, but not at resolving clinical signs. There is evidence that <b>face</b> <b>washing</b> in combination with topical tetracycline antibiotics can reduce the prevalence of severe trachoma compared to <b>face</b> <b>washing</b> alone.

40|$|Background: Trachoma is {{the second}} leading cause of {{blindness}} in Ethiopia. Even in trachoma hyperendemic areas, not all {{member of the community}} develop trichiasis. Whether this is due to uneven exposure or other factors is not clear. This necessitated a case-control study to see the extent of exposure among these groups. Objective: The {{purpose of the study was}} to assess the extent of exposure to known environmental risk factors among cases with trachomatous trichiasis and age, sex and location matched controls with no trachomatous trichiasis in Dalocha District, Central Ethiopia. Methods: all patients with clinically diagnosed trachomatous trichiasis (TT) according to the WHO definition for TT and an equal number of sex and location matched controls with no trachomatous trichasis were subjected to an interviewer administered questionnaire consisting of questions assessing family size, number of children raised, frequency of <b>face</b> <b>washing,</b> water sources and distance from it in minutes, location of kitchen, toilet waste disposal, place for cattle at night and some more considered to be related with repeated trachomatous infection. Results: One hundred ninety seven cases with TT and an equal number of controls were the study subjects. Regression analysis of individual risk factors showed that irregular <b>face</b> <b>washing</b> practice (odds ratio (OR)) = 2. 27; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 48 - 3. 49) and being illiterate (OR= 0. 34;CI: 0. 18 - 0. 64) were significantly associated with the development of TT. Regarding <b>face</b> <b>washing,</b> this significance was also maintained in a logistic regression analysis of the variables where the type of water used for washing and the frequency of cooking were also positively associated with TT. Conclusion: Improved educational status and regular <b>face</b> <b>washing</b> of the community may decrease the likelihood that people will be at risk of developing TT and its blinding complications...|$|R

40|$|An {{epidemiological}} survey {{carried out in}} the Dodoma region of Tanzania found that high rates of trachoma infection in pre-school children were associated with unwashed faces. Prior to a planned trachoma intervention project, a pilot study was done on household decisions about water use and perceptions about <b>face</b> <b>washing</b> and eye disease. The study found that mothers overestimated the amount of water necessary to <b>wash</b> a child's <b>face.</b> In addition, mothers would not change their water-use priorities without the consent of their husbands and the support of the community. Therefore a health education program was designed to address the perception that <b>face</b> <b>washing</b> required a great deal of water.

The final health campaign was designed to be compatible with the accepted patterns of decision making.
