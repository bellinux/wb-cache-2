40|$|Explosive upper-body movements, {{with which}} the load is not thrown (non-ballistic), may {{comprise}} a phase during which forces are produced {{in opposition to the}} motion of the load. Thirty men completed three test sessions (<b>free</b> <b>weight,</b> ballistic, and pneumatic), each consisting of a one-repetition maximum (1 -RM) and four explosive repetitions of a bench press at six loads (15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 % 1 -RM). The end of the lifting phase for the non-ballistic conditions (<b>free</b> <b>weight</b> and pneumatic) was defined by: the point of peak barbell displacement and {{the point at which the}} vertical force became negative (positive work). When analysed by peak displacement, the ballistic condition elicited significantly greater mean velocity, force, and power at loads of 15 - 60 % 1 -RM compared with the <b>free</b> <b>weight</b> condition. When the period of negative work was removed, the mean <b>free</b> <b>weight</b> velocity, force, and power at loads below 60 % 1 -RM increased. Consequently, the only differences between the <b>free</b> <b>weight</b> and ballistic conditions were found at loads of 15 % and 30 % 1 -RM.

500|$|Perkins brought {{discipline}} {{to a team}} that had been described as [...] "the country club of the NFL", and rebuilt the team with youth. Perkins claimed that the Buccaneers were more talented than the New York Giants team he had taken over in 1979, and selected a then-record 20 players in the 1987 NFL Draft. He improved their conditioning program, and instituted three-a-day practices. Perkins' harsh style was {{in stark contrast to}} the laid-back approach of his predecessor Bennett, of whom it was said that his [...] "idea of team discipline was everyone wearing the same color uniform on game day". Conditioning improvements included emphasizing <b>free</b> <b>weights</b> over Nautilus machines, to improve explosiveness. Players were also given pay incentives to work out, although Perkins expressed surprise that players should need extra incentive to improve their conditioning. The improved conditioning paid off early in the season: their opening-week 48–10 win over the Atlanta Falcons still (as of 2012) ranks as the most Buccaneer points scored in a game, matched only in Super Bowl XXXVII. The team had a 1–1 record when the season was disrupted by the 1987 players' strike. Unlike in previous seasons, when players' strikes stopped all play, the owners formed teams of replacement players to play the scheduled games. The Buccaneers had a 3–2 record when regular play resumed, and nearly beat a Chicago Bears team only one season removed from its Super Bowl victory. The game had been preceded by much media speculation over whether Bears star quarterback Jim McMahon would play. It was the first week since undergoing surgery after being dropped on his shoulder following a play the previous November that McMahon was in the Bears' lineup, although Mike Tomczak remained the starter for the game. The Buccaneers took a 20–0 lead and dominated the game for three quarters. Late in the third quarter, McMahon came off the bench and sparked the Bears to a 27–26 win, their biggest comeback in team history. Two weeks later, Tampa Bay had a 28–3 fourth quarter lead over the St. Louis Cardinals. In what is now the third-biggest comeback in NFL history, the Cardinals scored 4 touchdowns to win the game. The Buccaneers did not win again for the rest of the season. It was rare for an NFL team to fall into a season-long losing streak following such a defensive collapse. Once the Buccaneers were out of the playoff picture, Perkins began to prepare Testaverde for the next season. Testaverde's first start came on December 6 against the New Orleans Saints. His 369yards on 22 completions set a record for an NFL debut, but his two early fumbles set up a Saints lead that the Buccaneers were not able to overcome. Tackle Ron Heller, dispirited by Coach Perkins' confrontational attitude and three-a-day practices that he believed were causing unnecessary injuries to the players, got into a fight with Perkins at halftime of this game that led to his being traded to the Seattle Seahawks. In return, the Buccaneers received defensive lineman Randy Edwards and a 1989 6th-round draft pick that was used to select linebacker Derrick Little. Neither made the Buccaneers' squad. Heller went on to play seven more solid seasons. The Buccaneers finished the season with a 4–11 record. Their 3–4 division record placed them ahead of the 4–11 Detroit Lions for fourth place in the NFC Central. Ron Holmes had eight quarterback sacks despite appearing in only ten games. Ervin Randle, who was named a UPI Second Team All-NFC linebacker, was the only Buccaneer to be singled out for postseason honors.|$|E

30|$|To {{the best}} of the authors’ knowledge, though some {{frequency}} domain methods, such as the spectral decomposition theory and semi-group theory, are applied to investigate the stability of neutral systems, they are not as popular as Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF). Through LKF approach, many stability criteria have been proposed (see [11 – 13]). Recently, LMIs and <b>free</b> <b>weighting</b> matrices have been widely used in LKF for the stability of neutral systems (see [14 – 16]). For example, by constructing a new LKF with <b>free</b> <b>weighting</b> matrices, stability criteria for uncertain neutral systems were investigated in [11]. Moreover, <b>free</b> <b>weighting</b> matrices and model transformations were both employed in [14] for cross terms. Then a less conservative stability criterion based on LMIs was derived for stochastic neutral systems. However, control design based on these stability criteria is usually the state feedback, which is delay-independent or delay-dependent.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{present study}} {{describes}} the oxygen uptake and total energy expenditure (including both aerobic and anaerobic contribution) response during three different circuit weight training (CWT) protocols of equivalent duration composed of <b>free</b> <b>weight</b> exercises, machine exercises, and {{a combination of}} <b>free</b> <b>weight</b> exercises intercalating aerobic exercise. Design: Controlled, randomized crossover designs. Methods: Subjects completed in a randomized order three circuit weight training protocols of the same duration (3 sets of 8 exercises, 45 min 15 s) and intensity (70 % of 15 repetitions maximum). The circuit protocols were composed of <b>free</b> <b>weight</b> exercises, machine exercises, {{or a combination of}} <b>free</b> <b>weight</b> exercises with aerobic exercise. Oxygen consumption and lactate concentration were measured throughout the circuit to estimate aerobic and anaerobic energy expenditure respectively. Results: Energy expenditure is higher in the combined exercise protocol (29. 9 ± 3. 6 ml/kg/min), compared with Freeweight (24. 2 ± 2. 8 ml/kg/min) and Machine (20. 4 ± 2. 9 ml/kg/min). The combined exercise protocol produced the highest total energy expenditure but the lowest lactate concentration and perceived exertion. The anaerobic contribution to total energy expenditure was higher in the machine and <b>free</b> <b>weight</b> protocols compared with the combined exercise protocol (6. 2 %, 4. 6 % and 2. 3 % respectively). Conclusions: In the proposed protocols, the combined exercise protocol results in the highest oxygen consumption. Total energy expenditure is related to the type of exercise included in the circuit. Anaerobic contributions to total energy expenditure during circuit weight training may be modest, but lack of their estimation may underestimate total energy expenditure...|$|R
