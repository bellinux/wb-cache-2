500|$|When Ron tells Leslie to try {{to place}} a {{positive}} spin on the meeting and prevent a vote from occurring, Leslie attempts to filibuster the meeting. [...] Kate pushes for a vote, but Leslie says she will not hold one until she has heard from each audience member individually. [...] They criticize and yell at Leslie until 9 p.m., when she announces time is up and ends the meeting. [...] Marlene, who privately described the meeting as a [...] "train-wreck", nevertheless expresses her pride for Leslie with a smile. [...] Although frustrated with the meeting itself, Leslie says she is happy to have hosted her first subcommittee meeting. [...] When one resident, Lawrence (Eric Edelstein) says, [...] "Hey park lady, you suck", Leslie says with pride, [...] "Hear that? <b>He</b> <b>called</b> <b>me</b> 'park lady'".|$|E
500|$|Devers {{returned}} to the Military Academy for the third time, this time as graduate manager of athletics. The superintendent was now Major General William Durward Connor, an officer renowned for his sharp tongue. Devers later recalled that [...] "A {{lot of people were}} afraid of General Connor. <b>He</b> <b>called</b> <b>me</b> a moron once a week". The responsibility had grown considerably since the days when Devers was a cadet. Then there were only six varsity team sports; by 1936 there were eighteen. Despite the Great Depression, the Athletic Boards, which Devers ran, had accumulated considerable funds. His major task was the construction of new playing fields where there {{did not appear to be}} any available land. He came up with a plan to move the right of way of the West Shore Railroad. He found the railroad welcoming of the plan, as a shorter, straighter route saved them money. The new fields were completed in December 1936. He was promoted to full colonel on 1 July 1938.|$|E

500|$|Lennon Parham, {{an actress}} and comedian {{who worked with}} Amy Poehler on the Upright Citizens Brigade sketch comedy troupe, made a guest {{appearance}} in [...] "Canvassing" [...] as Kate Speevak. Michael Schur said {{early on in the}} brainstorming process, the Parks and Recreation producers decided to establish an antagonist for Leslie named Kate Speevak, simply because they thought the name was funny. Seth Gordon said Poehler and Parham worked especially well together during their largely improvised scenes, which he attributed to their past work together on the Upright Citizens Brigade. [...] The resident who appeared to be a sex offender during the canvassing was played by Brian Huskey, who Schur called a [...] "fantastic improviser". Eric Edelstein portrayed Lawrence, a resident who antagonizes Leslie and Andy during the public meeting. Edelstein was not originally the actor assigned the [...] "Hey parks lady, you suck" [...] line, but the Parks and Recreation producers like Edelstein so much they gave it to him. Leslie's response line, [...] "Hear that? <b>He</b> <b>called</b> <b>me</b> park lady", was improvised by Poehler.|$|E
500|$|After {{returning}} to New York, the New York Dolls played to capacity crowds at venues such as Max's Kansas City and the Mercer Arts Center in what Sylvain called a determined effort to [...] "fake it {{until they could}} make it": [...] "We had to make ourselves feel famous before we could actually become famous. We acted like we were already rock stars. Arthur even called his bass 'Excalibur' after King Arthur. It was crazy." [...] Their performance at the Mercer Arts Center was attended by journalist and Mercury Records publicity director Bud Scoppa, and Paul Nelson, an A executive for the label. Scoppa initially viewed them as an amusing but inferior version of the Rolling Stones: [...] "I split after the first set. Paul stuck around for the second set, though, and after show <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>me</b> and said, 'You should have stayed. I think they're really special.' Then, after that, I {{fell in love with}} them anyway." [...] In March 1973, the group signed a two-album deal with a US $25,000 advance from Mercury. According to Sylvain, some of the members' parents had to sign for them because they were not old enough to sign themselves.|$|E
500|$|The first Beach Boy to hear [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] in a semi-completed {{form was}} Carl Wilson, who had {{previously}} participated in rough guide vocals with Brian for the initial February mix. Following a performance with the touring group in North Dakota, he remembered: [...] "I came back up into my hotel room one night and the phone rang. It was Brian on the other end. <b>He</b> <b>called</b> <b>me</b> from the recording studio and played this really bizarre sounding music over the phone. There were drums smashing, that kind of stuff, and then it refined itself {{and got into the}} cello. It was a real funky track." [...] In 1976, Brian revealed that before the final mixdown, he had been confronted with resistance by members of the group, whom Brian declined to name. The subject of their worries and complaints was the song's length and [...] "modern" [...] sound: [...] "I said no, it's not going to be too long a record, it's going to be just right. ... They didn't quite understand what this jumping from studio to studio was all about. And they couldn't conceive of the record as I did. I saw the record as a totality piece." ...|$|E

500|$|De Laurentiis visited Ridley Scott {{on the set}} of Gladiator and {{suggested}} to Ridley he read the novel he had bought the rights to. Scott was in the third week before principal photography was due to finish on Gladiator. Gladiator became a commercial and critical success, earning 12 Academy Award nominations. De Laurentiis asked Scott if he would like to direct the film version of Hannibal. Scott misunderstood which Hannibal he meant, thinking De Laurentiis was speaking of the general and historical figure from Carthage who nearly brought down the Roman Empire back around 200 B.C., so he replied: [...] "Basically, Dino, I'm doing a Roman epic right now. I don't wanna do elephants coming over the Alps next, old boy." [...] Scott read the manuscript in four sittings within a week, believing it to be a [...] "symphony", and expressed his desire to do it. Scott further explains how he got involved: [...] "I was shooting Gladiator in Malta and one day, for the hell of it, I went for a walk for half a mile down the road to the Malta Film Studio to see my old buddy Dino. I had not seen him since I'd worked on a version of Dune. This was pre-Blade Runner. Dino had pursued me to direct Dune and another film. He's always enthusiastic and aggressive and came after me when I did both Blade Runner and Alien, but I couldn't do the films. Anyway, we had an espresso together and a few days later, <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>me</b> to ask if he could visit the Gladiator set. He arrived with a manuscript of Hannibal, about a month before it was published in book form. He said: 'Let's make this one.' I haven't read anything so fast since The Godfather. It was so rich in all kind of ways." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} shot on March 12, 2010 in Los Angeles, {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler. Mandler previously worked with Drake {{on the video}} for his collaboration with Mary J. Blige, [...] "The One". It premiered on VEVO on April 12, 2010. In an exclusive with Rap-Up, when asked about how the connection came about, Mandler said, [...] "I’m {{a big fan of}} Drake and I was really excited when <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>me</b> about doing it, and really put a lot into making it special and capturing what I think is an image he hasn’t had yet. Here’s a guy whose lyrical presence does not equal his visual presence yet, by any means. That’s something that he and I spoke a lot about. He felt strongly that nobody had really captured him, and some of the videos that had been done were less iconic than he would like to be represented as." [...] On Drake and the song he said, [...] "It’s so refreshing that he’s confident, but he’s not arrogant. I think that dimensionality is so important in a genre that is very one note with words like “bravado” and “swagger” and “arrogance” and “promiscuity.” Here’s a guy that’s finally putting a duality to the words and saying, “Yeah, I have all that and I do all that, but I’m also somebody that’s asking, is that what I should be doing with my life?" [...] When asked of the concept of the [...] "Over" [...] video, Mandler said that it was something that would not be expected. Mandler explained, [...] "Drake and I were very conscious about trying to push the limits and trying to push things forward. He came to me because he wanted to throw away the conventions of a medium, and take chances and be daring and take certain themes that are relevant to him and try to visualize them in not the obvious way".|$|E
2500|$|After comedian {{and actress}} Ellen DeGeneres {{came out as}} a lesbian, Falwell {{referred}} {{to her in a}} sermon as [...] "Ellen DeGenerate".

2500|$|At {{the age of}} seven, Ellington {{began taking}} piano lessons from Marietta Clinkscales. Daisy {{surrounded}} her son with dignified women to reinforce his manners and teach him to live elegantly. Ellington's childhood friends noticed that his casual, offhand manner, his easy grace, and his dapper dress gave him the bearing of a young nobleman, and began calling him [...] "Duke." [...] Ellington credited his chum Edgar McEntree for the nickname. [...] "I think he felt {{that in order for}} me to be eligible for his constant companionship, I should have a title. So <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>me</b> Duke." ...|$|E
2500|$|Producer Ken Nelson took a {{hands-off}} {{approach to}} producing Haggard. In the episode of American Masters dedicated to him, Haggard remembers: [...] "The producer I had at that time, Ken Nelson, was {{an exception to}} the rule. <b>He</b> <b>called</b> <b>me</b> 'Mr. Haggard' and I was a little twenty-four, twenty-five year old punk from Oildale... He gave me complete responsibility. I think if he'd jumped in and said, 'Oh, you can't do that,' it would've destroyed me." [...] In the documentary series Lost Highway, Nelson recalls, [...] "When I first started recording Merle, I became so enamored with his singing that I would forget what else was going on, and I suddenly realized, 'Wait a minute, there's musicians here you've got to worry about!' But his songs—he was a great writer." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sometime afterward, Bobby Kennedy {{obtained}} King's {{release from}} prison. Martin Luther King, Sr. was so {{grateful for the}} release that he voted for Kennedy and said [...] "I'll take a catholic or the devil himself if he'll wipe the tears from my daughter-in-law's eyes." [...] According to Coretta, Kennedy said [...] "I want to express my concern about your husband. I know this must be very hard on you. I understand you are expecting a baby, and I {{just want you to}} know that I was thinking about you and Dr. King. If there is anything I can do to help, please feel free to call on me." [...] Kennedy's contact with King was learned about quickly by reporters, with Coretta admitting that it [...] "made me feel good that <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>me</b> personally and let me know how he felt." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding The Thing, by John Carpenter, I've asked him, {{as he was}} {{preparing}} some electronic music with an assistant to edit on the film, [...] "Why did you call me, {{if you want to}} do it on your own?" [...] He surprised me, he said - [...] "I got married to your music. This is why I've called you." [...] I was quite amazed, <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>me</b> because he had my music at his wedding. Then when he showed me the film, later when I wrote the music, we didn't exchange ideas. He ran away, nearly ashamed of showing it to me. I wrote the music on my own without his advice. Naturally, as I had become quite clever since 1982, I've written several scores relating to my life. And I had written one, which was electronic music. And [...] took the electronic score.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to directing some television work, Bogdanovich returned to acting with a recurring guest {{role on the}} cable television series The Sopranos, playing Dr. Melfi's psychotherapist, also later directing a fifth-season episode. He also voiced the analyst of Bart Simpson's therapist in an episode of The Simpsons, and appeared as himself in the [...] "Robots Versus Wrestlers" [...] episode of How I Met Your Mother along with Arianna Huffington and Will Shortz. Quentin Tarantino also cast Bogdanovich as a disc jockey in [...] and [...] [...] "Quentin knows, because he's such a movie buff, that when you hear a disc jockey's voice in my pictures, it's always me, sometimes doing different voices," [...] said Bogdanovich. [...] "So <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>me</b> and he said, 'I stole your voice from The Last Picture Show for the rough cut, but I need you {{to come down and}} do that voice again for my picture...'" ...|$|E

2500|$|In an interview, Tancredo {{said his}} falling {{out with the}} White House has lasted. [...] "One reason I am persona non grata at the White House is {{not just because of}} immigration... but because I refuse to support him on his trade policy, his {{education}} policy, Medicare and prescription drugs initiatives.... Here was a Republican Congress increasing government to an extent larger than it had been increased since Medicare had come into existence." [...] Tancredo reported that his career in Congress was threatened by the leadership because of his stances. [...] "I was called into Tom DeLay's office because I was supporting Republican challengers to Republican incumbents. I had a group called Team America that went out and did that. <b>He</b> <b>called</b> <b>me</b> and said to me, 'You’re jeopardizing your career in this place by doing these things.' And I said, 'Tom, out of all the things you can threaten with me that is the least effective because I do not look at this place as a career.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Campese was {{involved}} in the biggest controversy of the World Cup Final in the 69th minute. English flanker Peter Winterbottom attempted a pass to Campese's opposing winger Rory Underwood, who at that stage [...] "may have had an overlap," [...] when Campese knocked the ball forward. The referee ruled it a deliberate knock-on and awarded England a penalty." [...] The English hooker, Brian Moore, thought the referee should have awarded a penalty try. Moore was reported after the Test to have said, [...] " [...] sets himself up as the saviour of rugby. Yet {{when it comes down to}} it he's as cynical as anyone. I wouldn't criticise Campese except <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>me</b> mad as a hatter earlier this week." [...] Moore writes in Beware of the Dog: Rugby's Hard Man Reveals All that, ‘I have no issue with what Campese did; I would have done the same, and he got away with it. The point I make about what he did is that, as he has been shown to be as cynical as the rest of us, I don’t now want to hear lectures from him about the spirit of the game.’ ...|$|E

I wasn't sure myself and obviously he's the master and the genius that figures this shit out. So the day the show premiered <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>me</b> and he explained it to me because I hadn't read any of the scripts. He explained to me what my character was going to be and I was like, 'Are you fucking kidding me? I love this! I love this! It's beyond!' To play the modern day Bloody Face and to have this whole back story of a guy who's thrown away and aborted and still lived! It was just like, are you kidding me? It was music to my ears, maybe nobody else's. But to me? I couldn't believe it. It's so twisted and dark and fucked up. That's why I'm on the show because I love stuff like that." ...|$|E
