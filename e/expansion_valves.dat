40|$|Abstract. A {{method to}} {{determine}} the condensing temperature set point of air-cooled refrigeration system with an electronic <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> was discussed in this paper. This set point is fixed for a specific system {{and is based on}} the flow characteristic of the installed electronic <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> in variant opening and pressure drop. As common sense, at constant differential between condensing pressure and evaporating pressure, larger opening of <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> allows more refrigerant flowing through the <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> into evaporator. This feature offers an opportunity to lower the condensing temperature via increasing opening of <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> to enhance refrigeration efficiency and in the same time designed cooling capacity can be maintained at low ambient temperature. In this case it is supposed that the installed electronic <b>expansion</b> <b>valve’s</b> capacity was larger than the evaporator’s, and in fact that occurs frequently in refrigeration system designing. The benefits of this method could include: the capacity of electronic <b>expansion</b> <b>valve</b> is fully utilized, the refrigeration system will operate at a lower condensing pressure and the power consumption of compressor can decrease, hence the improvement of system efficiency is predictable...|$|R

50|$|It is {{also common}} {{to find that}} {{refrigerant}} begins to evaporate immediately after the <b>expansion</b> <b>valve,</b> before arriving to the evaporator.

5000|$|A thermal {{expansion}} valve (often abbreviated as TEV, TXV, or TX valve) is a component in refrigeration and air conditioning systems that controls the amount of refrigerant and or voltage flow into the evaporator or electrical compartment thereby controlling the superheat or voltage, depending on the situation, at the outlet of the evaporator, or in the disconnect box.

50|$|There are {{two main}} types of thermal {{expansion}} valves: internally or externally equalized. The difference between externally and internally equalized valves is how the evaporator pressure affects {{the position of the}} needle. In internally equalized valves, the evaporator pressure against the diaphragm is the pressure at the inlet of the evaporator, whereas in externally equalized valves, the evaporator pressure against the diaphragm is the pressure at the outlet of the evaporator. Externally equalized thermostatic <b>expansion</b> <b>valves</b> compensate for any pressure drop through the evaporator.|$|E
50|$|Increasing use of {{superheating}} {{encouraged the}} replacement of slide valves with piston valves, as these were easier to lubricate at the increased operating temperatures.

This design was unsuccessful, owing to mechanical problems with differential thermal expansion of the two valve materials.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Expansion</b> <b>valves</b> are flow-restricting {{devices that}} cause a {{pressure}} drop {{of the working}} fluid. The valve needle remains open during steady state operation. The size of the opening or {{the position of the}} needle is related to the pressure and temperature of the evaporator. There are three main parts of the expansion valve that regulate the position of the needle. A sensor bulb, {{at the end of the}} evaporator, monitors the temperature change of the evaporator. This change in temperature creates a change in pressure on the diaphragm.|$|E
50|$|A two {{evaporator}} {{single compressor}} with individual <b>expansion</b> <b>valves</b> for each evaporator after {{passing through the}} back pressure valve enters into the compressors and hence {{there is a significant}} rise in temperature is observed. This system helps in dropping the pressure from high pressure evaporators with the help of back pressure valves. The high pressure ratio is obtained which necessarily compresses the vapor to high extent from the higher temperature evaporators to condenser temperature. This kind of refrigerator has greater application in load varying purpose. Moreover, high value of COP and better operating economy is observed.|$|E
50|$|Fitchburg were notable in also {{supplying}} {{an automatic}} governor (illus., left-hand flywheel) that controlled the valve's cut-off according to load. Such governors would become significant around 1900 {{with the development}} of the high-speed engine, where they were used to control speed precisely. In these earlier medium-speed engines, the function of these governors was not just to control the engine's speed, but also to improve efficiency. The Fitchburg piston valves could be operated with a cut-off from zero to two-thirds of the stroke. A larger cut-off improves efficiency when operating under light loads. Earlier engines had used devices such as <b>expansion</b> <b>valves</b> to achieve this, but they also required the continued attention of a skilled driver, who could 'drive' the engine by varying the cut-off as load changed. The earlier Watt governors only controlled a throttle valve, so although they controlled an engine's speed, they did not encourage efficiency. An engine operating with no cut-off but a throttled steam supply will be operating inefficiently, owing to reduced expansive working and the risk of wire-drawing. The first 'automatic' governors were termed that because they not only controlled the speed, but could also take over the role of the driver and could vary cut-off too.|$|E
