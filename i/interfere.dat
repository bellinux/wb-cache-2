5|$|For {{diseases}} of the heart rate or rhythm, {{a number of different}} antiarrhythmic agents are used. These may <b>interfere</b> with electrolyte channels and thus the cardiac action potential (such as calcium channel blockers, sodium channel blockers), <b>interfere</b> with stimulation of the heart by the sympathetic nervous system (beta blockers), or <b>interfere</b> with the movement of sodium and potassium across the cell membrane, such as digoxin. Other examples include atropine for slow rhythms, and amiodarone for irregular rhythms. Such medications are not the only way of treating {{diseases of}} heart rate or rhythm. In the context of a new-onset irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation), immediate electrical cardioversion may be attempted. For a slow heartbeat or heart block, a pacemaker or defibrillator may be inserted. The acuity of onset often affects how a rhythm disturbance is managed, as does whether a rhythm causes hemodynamic instability, such as low blood pressure or symptoms. An instigating cause is investigated for, such as a heart attack, medication, or metabolic problem.|$|E

40|$|Gene {{silencing}} using small <b>interfering</b> RNA {{has been}} proposed as a therapy for cancer, viral infections and other diseases. This study aimed to investigate whether layer-by-layer polymer surface modification could deliver small <b>interfering</b> RNA to decrease fibrotic processes associated with medical device implantation. Anti-green fluorescent protein labelled small <b>interfering</b> RNA was applied to tissue culture plates and polyurethane using a layer-by-layer technique with small <b>interfering</b> RNA and poly-L-lysine. In vitro studies showed {{that the level of}} down-regulation of green fluorescent protein was directly related to the number of coatings applied. This layer-by-layer coating technique was then used to generate Rhodamine-Flii small <b>interfering</b> RNA-coated implants for in vivo studies of small <b>interfering</b> RNA delivery via subcutaneous implantation in mice. After two days, Rh-positive cells were observed on the implants' surface indicating cellular uptake of the Rhodamine-Flii small <b>interfering</b> RNA. Decreased Flii gene expression was observed in tissue surrounding the Rhodamine-Flii small <b>interfering</b> RNA coated implants for up to seven days post implantation, returning to baseline by day 21. Genes downstream from Flii, including TGF-β 1 and TGF-β 3, showed significantly altered expression confirming a functional effect of the Rhodamine-Flii small <b>interfering</b> RNA on gene expression. This research demonstrates proof-of-principle that small <b>interfering</b> RNA can be delivered via layer-by-layer coatings on biomaterials and thereby can alter the fibrotic process.

In the article [...] "Interference suppression by practical transmit beamforming methods in closed femtocells" [...] by Husso et al., the authors utilize the availability of a control-only connection between a user equipment (UE) and an <b>interfering</b> femtocell base station (FBS) for interference suppression purposes. A simple two neighboring femtocell scenario is considered where the <b>interfered</b> UE requests the <b>interfering</b> FBS to replace its beamforming vector appropriately so that interference power directed to the <b>interfered</b> UE is minimized. While this reduces beamforming gain for a user connected to the <b>interfering</b> FBS, if used intelligently, it may prevent outages at neighboring femtocells with minimum performance degradation of the own users of the <b>interfering</b> FBS.|$|R

40|$|In many studies, the {{influence}} of intelligibility of the <b>interfering</b> speech is avoided by reversing it in time. Usually, intelligibility with time-reversed <b>interfering</b> speech indeed is higher compared to that with normal <b>interfering</b> speech. However, {{due to the nature}} of speech, reversed speech also gives rise to increased forward masking. The latter will result in a decrease in intelligibility. Thus, differences in intelligibility as a consequence of reversing speech in time are due to two opposite effects. This paper describes a speech reception threshold (SRT) test with intelligible and unintelligible <b>interfering</b> speech played normally and time-reversed. With Dutch listeners, Swedish reversed <b>interfering</b> speech gave a rise in SRT of 2. 3 dB compared with the Swedish <b>interfering</b> speech (played normally). The difference can be attributed to differences in forward masking. Dutch time-reversed <b>interfering</b> speech gave a decrease in SRT of 4. 3 dB compared to (intelligible) Dutch <b>interfering</b> speech. The latter is the result of both a release from informational masking and an increase in forward masking. Therefore, the amount of informational masking is larger than 4. 3 dB and, if one assumes similar differences in forward masking for Dutch and Swedish speech, may amount to 6. 6 d...|$|R
