5|$|In November 1978, Evans {{broke the}} Western Australian {{record for the}} 100m breaststroke during his final year at school. He and his father decided that he should step up his {{swimming}} career, and Evans entered the 1979 Australian Championships in Perth. Despite only four weeks of solid training {{leading up to the}} meet, Evans came second to Lindsay Spencer. Evans was omitted from the Australian squad that toured Britain because he was an unknown swimmer. After the meet, Evans vowed to become an elite swimmer and Olympian. A week later, Evans travelled to England to train at Crystal Palace in London under David Haller, coach of future Olympic breaststroke gold medallist Duncan Goodhew. Evans did so <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was insufficient coaching support for breaststrokers in Australia. In three months of training in London, Evans had risen up the breaststroke rankings from outside the top 200 into the top 25. He returned to Australia and won selection in the national team for the FINA (Fédération Internationale de Natation) World Cup in Japan, before returning to London for more training.|$|E
500|$|... "You May Now Kiss the... Uh... Guy Who Receives" [...] had {{an average}} of 7.8 million viewers and was the eighty-first most watched show of the week. Bob Sassone from TV Squad wrote that he could not stop {{laughing}} throughout the episode, <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is [...] "just something really funny about gay dogs getting married and a giant gold statue of Dig 'Em, the Sugar Smacks mascot". While reviewing the Family Guy: Volume 4 [...] DVD, Nancy Basile of About.com called the episode [...] "sharp".|$|E
5000|$|The band {{released}} the EP Samples on Collagen Rock Records in 2008.

500|$|Other {{sources of}} {{unhappiness}} Punk had with WWE were {{his failure to}} main-event a WrestleMania (deeming his entire career to be a failure as a result), being paid less than the other wrestlers in the three biggest matches of WrestleMania 29, doing favors for Vince McMahon and not being owed back, being [...] "creatively stifled" [...] and <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were no long-term plans for wrestlers other than John Cena, as well as receiving smaller paychecks and not getting answers {{as to how the}} WWE Network would affect wrestlers' salaries. Lastly, Punk described having left with [...] "zero passion" [...] for wrestling, and described himself {{at the time of the}} interview to be the happiest in many years.|$|E
500|$|There {{are some}} {{inherent}} criticisms to joint physical custody. A {{criticism of the}} joint physical custody arrangement is that {{due to the nature}} of the arrangement, the parents are in frequent contact with each other than in other situations, leading to conflict which has the potential to negatively impact all parties involved, including the children. Research does not support this concern. Numerous studies found that parents with joint physical custody had lower levels of conflict. There are numerous opinions that the constant moving back and forth between two homes will have a negative impact on children emotionally. The <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is [...] "Mom's House" [...] and [...] "Dad's House" [...] doesn't leave anywhere for the children to feel is [...] "my home".|$|E
500|$|Discussing Simmons' {{actions in}} the episode, Henstridge noted that the {{previous}} episodes in the season had established the character's new position high in the S.H.I.E.L.D. hierarchy so that this episode could see her abuse that power, using her position to help her friends, including the now ex-S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Johnson, rather than the agency of its director. Henstridge said that [...] "this is the whole reason that she [...] {{but it is a}} turning point for because in that moment she could've gone the other way" [...] and chose to protect her new position. Henstridge appreciated the episode exploring the relationship between Simmons and Johnson, <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was [...] "so much bad blood" [...] between them after the events of the third season that could be explored. She compared this to a relationship between sisters.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{think you}} would," [...] she said thoughtfully. [...] "But I can't tell it even {{to you because}} I can't tell it well enough yet.

500|$|Surprisingly strong {{feelings}} of guilt were manifested among republicans, and these became increasingly evident upon the Emperor's death in exile {{at the end of}} 1891. In Brazil, the news of the Emperor's death [...] "aroused a genuine sense of regret among those who, without sympathy for a restoration, acknowledged both the merits and the achievements of their deceased ruler." [...] The overthrown monarchy was still a fresh memory to Brazilians, to which was added a feeling of remorse over what they perceived as an unjust exile, followed by his lonely demise. Some republicans [...] "reconsidered the long banishment and reflected upon the severity of such action." [...] Even they believed that PedroII deserved a better end, and nostalgia spread among them as they [...] "started to see in the Imperial epoch a happier time, a golden age, forever gone." [...] The Empire began to be viewed more tolerantly by the new governments, and its considerable achievements were openly recognized. Now appeared [...] "a <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was once a time when Brazil was more respectable, more honest, and more powerful." ...|$|E
500|$|... "You Can't Win" [...] was {{originally}} written and performed during the pre-Broadway Baltimore {{run of the}} stage version of The Wiz in 1974, sung by the chorus of Winkies, the Wicked Witch's slaves. The number was cut from the musical before the official Broadway opening and wasn't performed again until the movie version was under consideration, 3 years later. [...] The producers resurrected the song as a solo for Michael Jackson to replace [...] "I Was Born on the Day Before Yesterday", which had been Scarecrow's solo in the Broadway musical. [...] "You Can't Win" [...] and its corresponding scene in the movie allude to mistreatment of African Americans. Jackson stated in his 1988 autobiography Moonwalk that the lyrics to [...] "You Can't Win" [...] are about humiliation and helplessness, feelings, he stated, that many people have experienced {{at one point in}} their life. The singer added that the song was also about [...] "the <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{are people out there who}} don't actively hold you back as much as they work quietly on your insecurities so that you hold yourself back". [...] "You Can't Win" [...] opens with the lines, [...] "You can't win, you can't break even, and you can't get out of the game. People keep sayin', things are gonna change, but they look just like they're staying the same." [...] William F. Brown, who wrote the book for the Broadway musical, stated that such verses made [...] "You Can't Win" [...] a [...] "black message song". Musically, the track has been described as an R, pop and soul song by Renée Graham of The Boston Globe. According to the sheet music published on Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing, the track was performed in common time, with a tempo of 80beats per minute. It adds that the song is composed in E with a range from B3 to C5.|$|E
2500|$|The IAAF {{rejected}} that explanation and gave Christie a two-years ban from athletics, despite UK Athletics <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was reasonable doubt whether the drug {{had been taken}} deliberately, a decision which ignored the usual drug testing principle of [...] "strict liability".|$|E
5000|$|... "Tree People" [...] {{received}} positive reviews. Les Chappell from The A.V. Club wrote, [...] "'Tree People' is one {{of those}} Grimm episodes where the creative team puts its world building on hold and tosses its heroes into the unknown. While most conventional episodes have Nick learning about a new portion of the wesen world, installments like 'Volcanalis' or 'La Llorona' introduce an air of an even deeper mystery, creatures that not even his ancestors' journals or his wesen allies can fully explain. Rather than sabotaging the world-building, it helps keep the <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>there's</b> still uncharted territory in the world." ...|$|R

2500|$|In March 2015, in an {{interview}} with Der Spiegel, he was asked if he was religious.

2500|$|Mencken countered the {{arguments}} for Anglo-Saxon superiority prevalent in his time in a 1923 essay entitled [...] "The Anglo-Saxon", which argued {{that if there was}} {{such a thing as a}} pure [...] "Anglo-Saxon" [...] race, it was defined by its inferiority and cowardice. [...] "The normal American of the 'pure-blooded' majority goes to rest every night with an uneasy <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a burglar under the bed and he gets up every morning with a sickening fear that his underwear has been stolen." ...|$|E
2500|$|Waterhouse also {{published}} a {{detailed discussion of}} beliefs expressed in the interviews. She noted that although most people [...] "hold their belief in reincarnation quite lightly" [...] and were unclear {{on the details of}} their ideas, personal experiences such as past-life memories and near-death experiences had influenced most believers, although only a few had direct experience of these phenomena. Waterhouse analyzed the influences of second-hand accounts of reincarnation, writing {{that most of the people}} in the survey had heard other people's accounts of past-lives from regression hypnosis and dreams and found these fascinating, <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> [...] "must be something in it" [...] if other people were having such experiences.|$|E
6000|$|Gwendolen {{paused in}} her turn, afraid of showing any emotion, and <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> {{nevertheless}} <b>there</b> was some {{change in her}} eyes as they met his.

5000|$|... "It is {{the nature}} of events like the Hopscotch Music Festival to either grow to {{oversized}} proportions, or wither and die. If Hopscotch's organizers could somehow bottle it and keep the festival right at this year's size indefinitely, {{that would be a very}} fine thing because it's really been perfect so far. The clubs have been crowded, but mostly not too crowded, with a great energy at shows around town and out on the street.

2500|$|Furtively, Arturo enters [...] "The Stranger" [...] Alaide's hut, {{desiring}} to {{know the}} identity of this mysterious woman. Inside, he sees a portrait of her dressed in royal robes, wearing jewels. He hears {{a voice in the}} distance, singing a lament which expresses the joys of solitude and of a lowly life. He realises that it is she and, when she comes into the room, she chastises him for entering her hut. He continues to demand that he is there only to help her and that he loves her, while she keeps pressuring him to leave her in peace expressing the <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is [...] "an insuperable barrier between us".|$|E
2500|$|Review {{aggregate}} site Metacritic {{was given}} a score of 55 out of 100 based on 59 critic reviews, indicating [...] "mixed or average" [...] reviews. Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu praised the atmosphere and spectacle, but noted difficulties during combat and handling the camera. Eurogamer's Oli Welsh negatively referred to the game as [...] "Japanese fetish gaming in full effect", being satisfied with the gunplay and magic systems but finding most other aspects either poorly designed or lacking substance. GamePro was highly critical, faulting {{almost every aspect of}} the game's design, <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was nothing good about the game and that it was not worth buying despite a promising premise. Joe Juba of Game Informer felt that the game had potential and praised the enemy designs, but its poor execution held the game back from being a fully enjoyable experience.|$|E
2500|$|At present, I am {{particularly}} {{excited by}} [...] "bad taste." [...] I have the deep <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{exists in the}} very essence of bad taste a power capable of creating those things situated far beyond what is traditionally termed [...] "The Work of Art." [...] I wish to play with human feeling, with its [...] "morbidity" [...] in a cold and ferocious manner. Only very recently I have become a sort of gravedigger of art (oddly enough, I am using the very terms of my enemies). Some of my latest works have been coffins and tombs. During the same time I succeeded in painting with fire, using particularly powerful and searing gas flames, some of them measuring three to four meters high. I use these to bathe the surface of the painting {{in such a way that}} it registered the spontaneous trace of fire.|$|E
5000|$|Les Chappell from The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an [...] "A-" [...] rating and wrote, [...] "'The End' {{is a series}} finale that {{definitely}} has that mood of a last go-around to it, the <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>there's</b> nothing {{to be gained by}} holding back. A literal devil walking the earth for ultimate power, a nigh nuclear poison to be brewed that takes all their combined talents, and the intervention of Grimms from beyond the grave — all of it is on display here. Even though there are some quibbles, they're quibbles that are {{as much a part of}} the Grimm experience as the witticisms and monsters." ...|$|R
60|$|The rector's {{dominant}} <b>feeling</b> was <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{had been}} a great escape. Gwendolen in love with Rex in return {{would have made a}} much harder problem, the solution of which might have been taken out of his hands. But he had to go through some further difficulty.|$|R
60|$|Albinia's first <b>feeling</b> was <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{was nothing}} in herself that could atone {{for the loss of}} so fair a creature, and the thought became more oppressive as she looked at a niche in the wall, holding a carved sandal-wood work-box, with a silver watch lying on it.|$|R
2500|$|Alienation {{is a term}} {{philosophers}} {{apply to}} a wide variety of phenomena, including any feeling of separation from, and discontent with, society; <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a moral breakdown in society; feelings of powerlessness in the face of the solidity of social institutions; the impersonal, dehumanised nature of large-scale and bureaucratic social organisations. Kierkegaard recognizes and accepts the notion of alienation, although he phrases it and understands it in his own distinctly original terms. For Kierkegaard, the present age is a reflective age—one that values objectivity and thought over action, lip-service to ideals rather than action, discussion over action, publicity and advertising over reality, and fantasy over the real world. For Kierkegaard, the meaning of values has been removed from life, by lack of finding any true and legitimate authority. Instead of falling into any claimed authority, any [...] "literal" [...] sacred book or any other great and lasting voice, self-aware humans must confront an existential uncertainty.|$|E
2500|$|On November 26, 1998, Pioneer LDC {{released}} {{a video game}} with the same name as the anime for the PlayStation. It was designed by Konaka and Yasuyuki, and made to be a [...] "network simulator" [...] in which the player would navigate to explore Lain's story. The creators themselves did not call it a game, but [...] "Psycho-Stretch-Ware", {{and it has been}} described as being a kind of graphic novel: the gameplay is limited to unlocking pieces of information, and then reading/viewing/listening to them, with little or no puzzle needed to unlock. Lain distances itself even more from classical games by the random order in which information is collected. The aim of the authors was to let the player get the <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are myriads of informations {{that they would have to}} sort through, and that they would have to do with less than what exists to understand. As with the anime, the creative team's main goal was to let the player [...] "feel" [...] Lain, and [...] "to understand her problems, and to love her". A guidebook to the game called Serial Experiments Lain Official Guide (...) was released the same month by MediaWorks.|$|E
2500|$|Out of the Unknown {{made its}} debut on Monday, 4 October 1965 at 8:00pm on BBC2 with Wyndham's “No Place Like Earth” {{selected}} as the opening story. Science fiction and fantasy was popular on television with Doctor Who, The Avengers, Thunderbirds, The Man from UNCLE and Lost in Space all notable hits at the time. Out of the Unknown, however, would offer more adult, cerebral fare. Initial audience and critical reaction was mixed but improved as the series went on with “Andover and the Android” (“It's not until intelligence, humour and gaiety break into television that you notice what tasteless pap we've been living on” - Daily Mail) and “Some Lapse of Time” (“It was not surprising to hear from Late Night Line Up {{that there had been}} many complimentary telephone calls after the play [...] it left the viewer with the disconcerting <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was more than a grain of truth in its fantasy” - Birmingham Evening Mail and Dispatch) proving particularly popular with audiences and critics alike. BBC2 Controller David Attenborough praised the “overall professionalism that has become a hallmark of the series”. By the end of its first run, Out of the Unknown was the most popular drama on BBC2 after the imported Western The Virginian.|$|E
