At 30 nm gate lengths, the devices show excellent device characteristics, indicating that this node can be met with conventional transistor design. At lower gate lengths of 20 and 15 nm, the devices still maintain excellent device characteristics and follow traditional scaling with respect to gate delay and energy delay, although off-state leakage and gate leakage do increase. At 10 nm gate lengths, the transistors continue to function as MOS devices, but they are limited by off-state leakage. One feasible method of significantly improving off-state leakage is through reducing the sub-threshold gradient. We show that <b>Depleted</b> <b>Substrate</b> <b>Transistors</b> (DST), a broad category of devices that include single- and doublegate transistors, whose active channel region stays fully depleted during operation, can achieve near-ideal subthreshold gradients and a reduction in off-state leakage of at least two orders of magnitude over bulk transistors. We believe that DST architecture will adequately address transistor scaling needs down to 10 nm gate lengths. In addition to DST device architecture, new electronic materials and modules will be needed to maintain high performance and low-parasitic leakages. As an example, to alleviate increasing gate leakage, changes in the gate stack are necessary. Replacement of SiO 2, the workhorse of the industry for over 30 years, with a high-K dielectric will be required. Other changes will include use of raised source/drain, metal gate electrodes and channel engineering...|$|R

The effects of series resistance, current–gain variation, high-level injection, and the Early effect on the accuracy of this PTAT voltage are discussed. The results of measurements made on <b>substrate</b> pnp <b>transistors</b> in a standard 0. 5 - m CMOS process are presented to illustrate the effects of these nonidealities.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{this work}} we present simple, physics-based models for two effects {{that have been}} noted in the fully {{depleted}} CCDs that are presently used in the Dark Energy Survey Camera. The first effect is the observation that the point-spread function increases slightly with the signal level. This is explained by considering the effect on charge-carrier diffusion due to {{the reduction in the}} magnitude of the channel potential as collected signal charge acts to partially neutralize the fixed charge in the depleted channel. The resulting reduced voltage drop across the carrier drift region decreases the vertical electric field and increases the carrier transit time. The second effect is the observation of low-level, concentric ring patterns seen in uniformly illuminated images. This effect is shown to be most likely due to lateral deflection of charge during the transit of the photo-generated carriers to the potential wells as a result of lateral electric fields. The lateral fields are a result of space charge in the fully <b>depleted</b> <b>substrates</b> arising from resistivity variations inherent to the growth of the high-resistivity silicon used to fabricate the CCDs...|$|R

In bipolar technology, the use of SOI substrate eliminates parasitic <b>substrate</b> <b>transistors</b> and associated latch-up, and {{has the ability to}} reduce crosstalk, particularly when combined with buried groundplanes (GP). Various technological SOI bipolar concepts are reviewed with special emphasis on the state-of-the-art SOI SiGe HBT devices in vertical and lateral design. More in depth results are shown from a UK consortium advanced RF platform technology, which includes SOI SiGe HBTs. Bonded wafer technology was developed to allow incorporation of buried silicide layers both above and below the buried oxide. New electrical and noise characterisation results pointed to reduced 1 /f noise in these devices compared to bulk counterparts. The lower noise is purported to arise from strain relief of the device structure due to the elasticity of the buried oxide layer during the high temperature epitaxial layer growth. The novel concept of the silicide SOI (SSOI) SiGe HBT technology developed for targeting a reduction in collector resistance, as well as for suppressing the crosstalk, is outlined.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Phosphatidylinositol {{transfer}} protein (PI-TP), {{which has}} the ability to transfer phosphatidylinositol (PI) from one membrane compartment to another, is required in the inositol lipid signalling pathway through phospholipase C–β (PLC–β) that is regulated by GTP-binding protein(s) in response to extracellular signals. Here, we test the hypothesis that the principal role of PI-TP is to couple sites of lipid hydrolysis to sites of synthesis, and so to replenish <b>depleted</b> <b>substrate</b> for PLC–β. Results We have designed an experimental protocol that takes advantage of the different rates of release of endogenous PI-TP and PLC-β from HL 60 cells permeabilized with streptolysin O. We have examined the kinetics of stimulated inositol lipid hydrolysis in cells depleted of PI-TP, but not of endogenous PLC-β, in the presence and absence of exogenous PI-TP. Linear time-courses were observed {{in the absence of any}} added protein, and the rate was accelerated by PI-TP using either guanosine 5 ′[γ-thio]-triphosphate (GTPγS) or the receptor-directed agonist fMetLeuPhe as activators. In addition, depletion from the cells of both PI-TP and PLC-β isoforms by extended permeabilization (40 minutes) allowed us to control the levels of PLC–β present in the cells. Once again, PI-TP increased the rates of reactions. To identify whether the role of PI-TP was to make available the substrate phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP 2) for the PLC, we examined the synthesis of PIP 2 in cells depleted of PI-TP. We found that PI-TP was essential for the synthesis of PIP 2. Conclusion The predicted function of PI-TP in inositol lipid signalling is the provision of substrate for PLC–β from intracellular sites where PI is synthesized. We propose that PI-TP is in fact a co-factor in inositol lipid signalling and acts by interacting with the inositol lipid kinases. We hypothesize that the preferred substrate for PLC–β is not the lipid that is resident in the membrane but that provided through PI-TP...|$|R

Such a test is important to the detection and prevention of pollution of rivers, lakes, and other receiving waters. Proper operation of existing waste water treatment plants and the design of new waste treatment plants also depend on such a parameter. Rapid development of the chemical industry in recent years has further emphasized the need for such a test. A new test is presented which measures the disappearance of soluble organics from a substrate in contact with an active mass culture of mixed microbial organisms. Soluble organics in the system are measured by the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) test and reported in oxygen equivalents. The system substrate COD reaches a minimum when the soluble organics available to the mass culture for metabolism have been <b>depleted.</b> <b>Substrate</b> COD remains relatively constant from this point on. The difference between the initial substrate COD and the minimum substrate COD reached after aeration is then the Total Biological Oxygen Demand (TbOD) of the system. This TbOD test may be completed in 6 to 8 hours (approximately 4 to 6 hours laboratory time). In addition to measuring the TbOD, the test may be used, with modifications, to define process kinetics for design, to serve as a daily log of plant operation, or be used as a quick method of diagnosing plant operation difficulties.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} divided in two parts, one {{dealing with the}} {{depleted}} Si/Si structure, which is a substrate behaving as a semi-insulating material intended for radio-frequency applications and the other concerning high-k gate dielectrics (dielectrics with high dielectric constant) as the replacement for silicon dioxide as MOS gate dielectric. High frequency applications of CMOS integrated circuits, to lower cost, achieve higher performance and richer functionality, depends partly on the possibility to decrease the substrate coupling between {{different parts of the}} circuit. The depleted Si/Si structure is a type of semi-insulating substrate that by fabrication technical efforts introduces a depleted layer between a silicon device film and the silicon bulk, with the intension to minimize substrate coupling and substrate losses. In contrast to the alternative approach of using standard Silicon-On-Insulator solutions the depleted structure will not confine the thermal dissipation. Characterization show that the <b>depleted</b> <b>substrate</b> is superior to standard silicon bulk material in the case of suppressing the crosstalk, and may have potential as a substrate for high frequency or mixed mode integration applications. The continuing scaling of the MOS transistor introduces new problems to overcome. One of the most prominent ones is the increased power dissipation and lowered reliability that results from the thinning of the gate dielectric layer. SiO 2 has been the perfect gate oxide and has survived 30 years of scaling but may now have reached its limit. The high-k gate dielectrics may solve the leakage and reliability problem since it can be maid thicker and still achieve the needed result. However, there is still lot {{of work to be done}} to fully realize the replacement of SiO 2, such as deposition and formation techniques as well as a deeper understanding of the high-k structure and interface behavior.
