40|$|<b>Hereditary</b> spherocytosis and <b>elliptocytosis</b> {{are common}} genetic defects {{of the red}} blood cell {{membrane}} skeleton. In recent years rapid advances {{have been made in}} the knowledge of the protein structure and assembly of the cytoskeleton. Thanks to the wide use of protein analysis methods several alterations have been discovered in functionally important domains of the different cytoskeletal proteins in these diseases. The cloning of cDNA for the majority of the cytoskeletal proteins allows us to begin elucidating some of these defects at the DNA level. This paper will review the effects of recent advances upon: cytoskeleton structure and assembly; molecular pathology of spherocytosis, elliptocytosis and pyropoikilocytosis...|$|R
40|$|The short actin {{filaments}} in the {{red blood}} cell (RBC) membrane skeleton are capped at their pointed ends by tropomodulin 1 (Tmod 1) and coated with tropomyosin (TM) along their length. Tmod 1 -TM control of actin filament length is hypothesized to regulate spectrin-actin lattice organization and membrane stability. We used a Tmod 1 knockout mouse to investigate the in vivo role of Tmod 1 in the RBC membrane skeleton. Western blots of Tmod 1 -null RBCs confirm the absence of Tmod 1 and show the presence of Tmod 3, which is normally not present in RBCs. Tmod 3 is present at only one-fifth levels of Tmod 1 present on wild-type membranes, but levels of actin, TMs, adducins, and other membrane skeleton proteins remain unchanged. Electron microscopy shows that actin filament lengths are more variable with spectrin-actin lattices displaying abnormally large and more variable pore sizes. Tmod 1 -null mice display a mild anemia with features resembling <b>hereditary</b> spherocytic <b>elliptocytosis,</b> including decreased RBC mean corpuscular volume, cellular dehydration, increased osmotic fragility, reduced deformability, and heterogeneity in osmotic ektacytometry. Insufficient capping of actin filaments by Tmod 3 may allow greater actin dynamics at pointed ends, resulting in filament length redistribution, leading to irregular and attenuated spectrin-actin lattice connectivity, and concomitant RBC membrane instability...|$|R
40|$|Maintenance of {{membrane}} {{integrity and}} {{organization in the}} metazoan cell is accomplished through intracellular tethering of membrane proteins to an extensive, flexible protein network. Spectrin, the principal component of this network, is anchored to membrane proteins through the adaptor protein ankyrin. To elucidate the atomic basis for this interaction, we determined a crystal structure of human Î²I-spectrin repeats 13 to 15 in complex with the ZU 5 -ANK domain of human ankyrin R. The structure reveals the role of repeats 14 to 15 in binding, the electrostatic and hydrophobic contributions along the interface, and the necessity for a particular orientation of the spectrin repeats. Using structural and biochemical data as a guide, we characterized the individual proteins and their interactions by binding and thermal stability analyses. In addition to validating the structural model, these data {{provide insight into the}} nature of some mutations associated with cell morphology defects, including those found in human diseases such as <b>hereditary</b> spherocytosis and <b>elliptocytosis.</b> Finally, analysis of the ZU 5 domain suggests it is a versatile protein-protein interaction module with distinct interaction surfaces. The structure represents not only the first of a spectrin fragment in complex with its binding partner, but also that of an intermolecular complex involving a ZU 5 domain...|$|R
25|$|Elliptocytosis a blood {{disorder}} {{in which an}} abnormally large number of the patient's erythrocytes are elliptical. There is much genetic variability amongst those affected. There are three major forms of hereditary elliptocytosis: common <b>hereditary</b> <b>elliptocytosis,</b> spherocytic elliptocytosis and southeast Asian ovalocytosis.|$|E
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of those with <b>hereditary</b> <b>elliptocytosis</b> require no treatment whatsoever. They have a mildly increased risk of developing gallstones, which is treated surgically with a cholecystectomy if pain becomes problematic. This risk is relative to {{the severity of the}} disease.|$|E
25|$|These {{mutations}} have {{a common}} end result; they destabilise the cytoskeletal scaffold of cells. This stability is especially important in erythrocytes as they are constantly {{under the influence of}} deforming shear forces. As disc-shaped erythrocytes pass through capillaries, which can be 2-3 micrometres wide, they are forced to assume an elliptical shape in order to fit through. Normally, this deformation lasts only as long as a cell is present in a capillary, but in <b>hereditary</b> <b>elliptocytosis</b> the instability of the cytoskeleton means that erythrocytes deformed by passing through a capillary are forever rendered elliptical. These elliptical cells are taken up by the spleen and removed from circulation when they are younger than they would normally be, meaning that the erythrocytes of people with <b>hereditary</b> <b>elliptocytosis</b> have a shorter than average life-span (a normal person's erythrocytes average 120 days or more).|$|E
40|$|Restricted tryptic {{digestion}} of erythrocyte spectrin at 4 degrees C {{followed by}} two-dimensional (isoelectric-focusing/sodium dodecyl sulfate) polyacrylamide electrophoresis yields highly reproducible maps of approximately 50 peptides with molecular weights between 80, 000 and 12, 000. Based on molecular weight and isoelectric point (pI), each unique alpha- and beta-subunit domain {{can be identified}} and compared with spectrin peptides from other individuals. The alpha-subunit of spectrin from 60 Caucasian donors contains a 46, 000 -mol-wt tryptic domain, called alpha II-T 46, Type 1; more extensive tryptic digestion of this domain generates peptides with molecular weights of 35, 000, 30, 000, 25, 000, and 16, 000. Spectrin from 29 of 37 black donors representing 14 kindreds shows variation in the molecular weight and/or pI of peptides from the alpha II domain. In the most common form, Type 2, alpha II tryptic peptides are increased in molecular weight by 4, 000, and the pI becomes more basic. Other alpha II variants are characterized by either the 4, 000 increase in molecular weight (Type 3) or by the basic shift in pI (Type 4). When limit peptide maps of intermediate-sized tryptic and CNBr peptides from the alpha II-domain Types 1 and 2 are compared, a consistent alteration in the chromatographic mobility of one limit peptide is observed. Polymorphism in the alpha II subunit of spectrin did not itself produce anemia, nor did it appear to alter the expression of an underlying <b>hereditary</b> spherocytosis or <b>elliptocytosis.</b> In six family studies, the alpha II 46, 000 -mol-wt variations observed were consistent with Mendelian inheritance...|$|R
40|$|Fixation {{procedures}} (Bessis and Weed, 1972) ] for the SEM {{observation of}} erythrocytes nowadays prove reliable, so that most artifacts are prevented from occurring. Thus SEM {{results in a}} useful method for examining normal and haemolytic patterns. Normal reticulocytes are polylobulate since they undergo through the splenic slits shape remodeling and foreign body extrusion. In premature infants the latter may occur spontaneously throughout the circulation owing to spleen immaturity. Spherocytosis is due to ATP depletion in the oldest cells and thus represents the normal pre-lytic stage. Such deformation is present in most erythrocytes during the haemolytic bouts of hereditary spherocytosis and in most defects of anaerobic glycolysis. Like <b>hereditary</b> spherocytosis, also <b>elliptocytosis</b> is caused by protein n mbrane defects. The hallmark of thalassaemias is anisopoikilocytosis, due to increased membrane-haemoglobin content ratio. To overlapping unbalance of the globin chain synthesis ratio, more marked surface deformations in alpha- than in beta-thalassaemia correspond. In Hb H disease chain excess precipitates peripherally, in Cooley's anaemia centrally as large clusters. This {{is due to the}} more hydrophylic conditions of beta chains (Zavagli et al., 1982) 2. Thalassaemia may be associated with other abnormal haemoglobins, such as Hb S. Haemolysis may also be due to physical agents, namely shearing stress caused by (a) fibrin deposition throughout the microcirculation, such as in Moschkowitz and Gasser syndromes, (b) prosthetic heart valves, and (c) march haemoglobinuria. IgG-caused haemolytic anaemia may or mav not be associated with complement involvement: early stages may occur intravascularly, but lysis is completed in the spleen and liver through phagocytic receptors. Conversely paroxysmal noctural haemoglobinuria (PNH) is exclusively complement-mediated owing to the characteristic red cell susceptibility to such lytic system. Scanning can reliably distinguish PNH II from PNH III cells (Zavagli et al., 1978) ...|$|R
25|$|Common <b>hereditary</b> <b>elliptocytosis</b> is {{the most}} common form of elliptocytosis, and the form most {{extensively}} researched. Even when looking only at this form of elliptocytosis, there is a high degree of variability in the clinical severity of its subtypes. A clinically significant haemolytic anaemia occurs only in 5-10% of sufferers, with a strong bias towards those with more severe subtypes of the disorder.|$|E
25|$|Inheritance of {{multiple}} mutations tends to infer more serious disease. For instance, {{the most common}} genotype responsible for HPP occurs when the affected individual inherits an Î±-spectrin mutation from one parent (i.e. one parent has <b>hereditary</b> <b>elliptocytosis)</b> and the other parent passes on an as-yet-undefined defect that causes the affected individual's cells to preferentially produce the defective Î±-spectrin rather than normal Î±-spectrin.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of <b>hereditary</b> <b>elliptocytosis</b> is usually made by coupling {{a family history}} of the condition with an appropriate clinical presentation and confirmation on a blood smear. In general it requires that at least 25% of erythrocytes in the specimen are abnormally elliptical in shape, though the observed percentage of elliptocytes can be 100%. This is in contrast {{to the rest of the}} population, in which it is common for up to 15% of erythrocytes to be elliptical.|$|E
25|$|The Gerbich antigen {{system is}} an {{integral}} membrane protein of the erythrocyte and plays a functionally important role in maintaining erythrocyte shape. It also acts as the receptor for the P. falciparum erythrocyte binding protein. There are four alleles of the gene which encodes the antigen, Ge-1 to Ge-4. Three types of Ge antigen negativity are known: Ge-1,-2,-3, Ge-2,-3 and Ge-2,+3. persons with the relatively rare phenotype Ge-1,-2,-3, are less susceptible (~60% of the control rate) to invasion by P. falciparum. Such individuals have a subtype of a condition called <b>hereditary</b> <b>elliptocytosis,</b> characterized by oval or elliptical shape erythrocytes.|$|E
25|$|There are {{currently}} more than 50 known membrane proteins, which can {{exist in a}} few hundred up to a million copies per red blood cell. Approximately 25 of these membrane proteins carry the various blood group antigens, such as the A, B and Rh antigens, among many others. These membrane proteins can perform a wide diversity of functions, such as transporting ions and molecules across the red cell membrane, adhesion and interaction with other cells such as endothelial cells, as signaling receptors, {{as well as other}} currently unknown functions. The blood types of humans are due to variations in surface glycoproteins of red blood cells. Disorders of the proteins in these membranes are associated with many disorders, such as hereditary spherocytosis, <b>hereditary</b> <b>elliptocytosis,</b> hereditary stomatocytosis, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.|$|E

2500|$|The {{incidence}} of <b>hereditary</b> <b>elliptocytosis</b> {{is hard to}} determine, as many sufferers of the milder forms of the disorder are asymptomatic and their condition never comes to medical attention.

It is estimated that its incidence is between 3 and 5 per 10,000 in the United States, and that those of African and Mediterranean descent are of higher risk.

2500|$|<b>Hereditary</b> <b>elliptocytosis,</b> {{also known}} as ovalocytosis, is an {{inherited}} blood disorder in which an abnormally large number of the patient's erythrocytes (i.e. red blood cells) are elliptical rather than the typical [...] disc shape. Such morphologically distinctive erythrocytes are {{sometimes referred to as}} elliptocytes or ovalocytes. It is one of many red-cell membrane defects. In its severe forms, this disorder predisposes to haemolytic anaemia. Although pathological in humans, elliptocytosis is normal in camelids.|$|E
2500|$|EL2 and EL3: The {{most common}} genetic defects (present in {{two-thirds of all}} cases of <b>hereditary</b> <b>elliptocytosis)</b> are in genes for the polypeptides Î±-spectrin or Î²-spectrin. These two polypeptides combine {{with one another in}} vivo to form an Î±Î² heterodimer. These Î±Î² heterodimers then combine to form spectrin tetramers. [...] These spectrin tetramers are among the basic {{structural}} subunits of the cytoskeleton of all cells in the body. Although there is much interindividual variability, it is generally true that Î±-spectrin mutations result in an inability of Î±-spectrin to interact properly with Î²-spectrin to form a heterodimer. In contrast, it is generally true that Î²-spectrin mutations lead to Î±Î² heterodimers being incapable of combining to form spectrin tetramers. In both cases the end result is a weakness in the cytoskeleton of the cell. Individuals with a single mutation in one of the spectrin genes are usually asymptomatic, but those who are homozygotes or are compound heterozygotes (i.e. they are heterozygous for two different elliptocytosis-causing mutations) have sufficient cell membrane instability to have a clinically significant haemolytic anaemia.|$|E
