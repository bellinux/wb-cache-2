500|$|In April 2006, Edward Jones and the ACLU {{sued the}} City of Los Angeles, {{on behalf of}} Robert Lee Purrie and five other {{homeless}} people, for the city's violation of the 8th and 14th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, and Article <b>I,</b> <b>sections</b> 7 and 17 of the California Constitution (supporting due process and equal protection, and prohibiting cruel and unusual punishment). The Court {{ruled in favor of}} the ACLU, stating that, [...] "the LAPD cannot arrest people for sitting, lying, or sleeping on public sidewalks in Skid Row." [...] Enforcement of section 41.18(d) 24 hours a day against persons who have nowhere else to sit, lie, or sleep, other than on public streets and sidewalks, is breaking these amendments. The Court said that the anti-camping ordinance is [...] "one of the most restrictive municipal laws regulating public spaces in the United States". Jones and the ACLU wanted a compromise in which the LAPD is barred from enforcing section 41.18(d) (arrest, seizure, and imprisonment) in Skid Row between the hours of 9:00p.m. and 6:30am. The compromise plan permits the homeless to sleep on the sidewalk, provided they are not [...] "within 10 feet of any business or residential entrance" [...] and only between these hours. One of the motivations for the compromise is the shortage of space in the prison system. Downtown development business interests and the Central City Association (CCA) were against the compromise. Police Chief William Bratton said the case had slowed the police effort to fight crime and clean up Skid Row, and that when he was allowed to clean up Skid Row, real estate profited. On September 20, 2006, the Los Angeles City Council voted to reject the compromise. On October 3, 2006, police arrested Skid Row's transients for sleeping on the streets {{for the first time in}} months.|$|E

2500|$|By contrast, other {{courts have}} {{interpreted}} the Constitution as providing even broader taxation powers for Congress. In Murphy v. IRS, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the {{federal income tax}} imposed on a monetary settlement recovery that the same court had previously indicated was not income, stating: [...] "lthough the 'Congress cannot make a thing income which is not so in fact,'...it can label a thing income and tax it, {{so long as it}} acts within its constitutional authority, which includes not only the Sixteenth Amendment but also Article <b>I,</b> <b>Sections</b> 8 and 9." ...|$|E

2500|$|On July 3, 2007, the Court ruled (1) {{that the}} taxpayer's {{compensation}} was received {{on account of}} a non-physical injury or sickness; (2) that gross income under section 61 of the Internal Revenue Code does include compensatory damages for non-physical injuries, even if the award is not an [...] "accession to wealth," [...] (3) that the income tax imposed on an award for non-physical injuries is an indirect tax, {{regardless of whether the}} recovery is restoration of [...] "human capital," [...] and therefore the tax does not violate the constitutional requirement of Article I, section 9, that capitations or other direct taxes must be laid among the states only in proportion to the population; (4) that the income tax imposed on an award for non-physical injuries does not violate the constitutional requirement of Article I, section 8, that all duties, imposts and excises be uniform throughout the United States; (5) that under the doctrine of sovereign immunity, the Internal Revenue Service may not be sued in its own name. The Court stated: [...] "lthough the 'Congress cannot make a thing income which is not so in fact,' [...] it can label a thing income and tax it, so long as it acts within its constitutional authority, which includes not only the Sixteenth Amendment but also Article <b>I,</b> <b>Sections</b> 8 and 9." [...] Citing Commissioner v. Banks, the court noted that [...] "the power of the Congress to tax income 'extends broadly to all economic gains.'" [...] The court ruled that Ms. Murphy was not entitled to the tax refund she claimed, and that the personal injury award she received was [...] "within the reach of the congressional power to tax under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution" [...] -- even if the award was [...] "not income within the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment".|$|E
