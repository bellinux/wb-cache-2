5|$|As {{the taping}} time, 6 pm, is fast approaching, Tracy begins acting strangely. Liz and Pete {{discover}} {{that he has}} not been taking his medication correctly. Liz calls Tracy's doctor, Dr. Leo Spaceman (Chris Parnell), who gives her instructions regarding the medication. Liz gives the instructions to Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) who has to visit multiple identical pharmacies until he finds the correct one, which will have Tracy's new medication. Liz and Pete's attempts to get Tracy to the Late Night stage on time are further complicated as Jack persistently calls Liz to his office to ask for her advice on a speech he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> at The Waldorf Astoria. Tracy eventually appears on Late Night only to immediately fall asleep after sitting down.|$|E
5|$|I've {{always tried}} to insert {{positivity}} into my songs wherever I can, to inspire other people who go through stuff. I mean the stuff they talked about in tabloids {{and the things that}} were so overly exaggerated, that's one aspect. I also went through a lot of personal stuff, a lot of family stuff this year. Losing a parent is an intense thing for anybody. It's brought me to another place. People are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> into it as, 'This is Mariah and her struggle'. But the way I try to word it is, 'It's OK once you say I can make it through the rain.' Not just me going, 'I can make it through the rain,' it's me telling people that if you believe you can get through whatever you're going through, you can get to the other side.|$|E

Montag subdues her and tells her {{that the two of}} them are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the books to see if they have value. If they do not, he promises the books will be burned, and all will return to normal.|$|E

500|$|Lauren Weisberger, {{a former}} Wintour {{assistant}} who left Vogue for Departures along with Richard Story, wrote The Devil Wears Prada after a writing workshop he suggested she take. It was eagerly anticipated for its supposed insider portrait of Wintour {{prior to its}} publication. Wintour told The New York Times, [...] "I always enjoy a great piece of fiction. I haven't decided whether I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> it or not." [...] While {{it has been suggested}} that the setting and Miranda Priestly were based on Vogue and Wintour, Weisberger claims she drew not only from her own experiences but those of her friends as well. Wintour herself makes a cameo appearance near the end of the book, where it is said she and Miranda dislike each other.|$|E
500|$|She {{had a small}} role in the 2005 romantic drama Shopgirl {{and played}} the {{babysitter}} of George and Kathy Lutz's children in The Amityville Horror (2005). For the latter role she was nominated for the Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Scream Scene and the MTV Movie Award for Best Frightened Performance. She later revealed that she almost did not audition for the film due to her fear of dogs. [...] " [...] Michael Bay has these gigantic [...] [...] And, when I went to audition for The Amityville Horror, I went into his offices and literally these three huge dogs were there, and I almost turned around. I was like, 'No, I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> for this film.' I actually used the dogs in my audition {{to think of what}} would scare me the most." [...] The Amityville Horror received generally negative reception from critics, but was a commercial success.|$|E
500|$|Steven Zaillian (writer of Schindler's List) {{was offered}} the chance to write the {{adaptation}} after Tally passed, but he also declined. He explained that [...] "I was busy. And I wasn't sure I was interested. You can almost never win when you do a sequel." [...] David Mamet was the first screenwriter to produce a draft, which, according to Ridley Scott and the producers, needed major revisions. Stacey Snider, co-chairman of Universal Pictures (a co-production deal was struck between Universal and MGM) said on the rejection of Mamet's screenplay: [...] "There's no way David was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> 15 pages of our notes and then be available {{to work on the}} script day-to-day." [...] Mamet was preparing to direct his own film. Zaillian, who had already passed, reconsidered and became involved in the project, saying: [...] "It's hard to say no to Dino once and it's almost impossible to say no to him twice." [...] A script review at ScreenwritersUtopia.com describes the Mamet draft as [...] "stunningly bad" [...] but found Zaillian's rewrite to be [...] "gripping entertainment".|$|E

A governess called [...] "Miss Kitty" [...] who came from across the Channel, instilled in him the love of - and competence in - the English language. The proctor caught him reading a book by Rimbaud or Mallarmé, and reprimanded him, [...] "Let's have no disorder in your studies!". Cartier-Bresson said, [...] "He used the informal 'tu', which usually meant {{you were about to}} get a good thrashing. But he went on, 'You're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> in my office.' Well, that wasn't an offer he had to repeat." ...|$|E
2500|$|The rebel defeat {{has been}} {{attributed}} by {{one side to}} a misjudgement of Déby's strength, which brought to an attack with too few troops and heavy weapons, and by the other side due to divisions among the rebel commanders. While stating that the troops were well coordinated during the battle, some of the participants mentioned the three-headed leadership {{as one of the}} reasons for the defeat. The rivality among the groups had surfaced easily during the groups, as recognized by Nouri: [...] "In Ndjamena we wanted to send out a radio message, but we were unable to agree on which leader was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> it out", adding that [...] "after the fall of the regime our objectives are different." ...|$|E

2500|$|While early {{reviews for}} The Lord of the Rings were mixed, reviews in various media have been, on the whole, highly {{positive}} and acknowledge Tolkien's literary achievement {{as a significant}} one. The initial review in the Sunday Telegraph described it as [...] "among the greatest works of imaginative fiction of the twentieth century". The Sunday Times echoed this sentiment, stating that [...] "the English-speaking world is divided into those who have read The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit {{and those who are}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> them". The New York Herald Tribune also seemed to have an idea of how popular the books would become, writing in its review that they were [...] "destined to outlast our time". W. H. Auden, an admirer of Tolkien's writings, regarded The Lord of the Rings as a [...] "masterpiece", further stating that in some cases it outdid the achievement of John Milton's Paradise Lost.|$|E
