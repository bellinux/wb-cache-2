5|$|Brachiopod fossils {{have been}} useful {{indicators}} of climate changes during the Paleozoic <b>era.</b> <b>When</b> global temperatures were low, {{as in much}} of the Ordovician, the large difference in temperature between equator and poles created different collections of fossils at different latitudes. On the other hand, warmer periods, such much of the Silurian, created smaller difference in temperatures, and all seas at the low to middle latitudes were colonized by the same few brachiopod species.|$|E
5|$|Chappell had {{a direct}} {{influence}} on Hughes' successor, Allan Border. Early in his captaincy tenure, Border was struggling with the burdens of the position so the ACB appointed Bob Simpson as team coach to assist. This led to animosity between Chappell and Simpson as Chappell derided {{the need for a}} coach. Simpson responded by writing that the peer influence of older players helping younger players fell away during the <b>era</b> <b>when</b> the Chappell brothers led the team, and he was redressing the problem.|$|E

5|$|He was {{generally}} more highly regarded for his batting than his wicket-keeping, often drawing criticism {{for the quality}} of his glovework. Despite this, he was at times considered to be a better wicket-keeper than two of his rivals for England; Bairstow and Buttler. Nonetheless, playing in an <b>era</b> <b>when</b> international teams did not play specialist wicket-keepers, Kieswetter's selection was based primarily upon his batting ability, rather than his keeping ability. For a couple of matches during 2012, he was used as an off spin bowler by Somerset, collecting three wickets.|$|E
5|$|In an <b>era</b> <b>when</b> defencemen were {{expected}} to stay behind during the play, Stuart became known {{for his ability to}} score goals while playing a defensive role, and for his ability to remain calm during matches that often turned violent. He also became known for his work to reduce that violence and to increase the salaries of hockey players. His efforts were acknowledged when the Hockey Hall of Fame was created in 1945 and {{he became one of the}} first nine players to be inducted. He was joined there by his brother Bruce in 1961.|$|E

2500|$|Tetradia: Sometimes 4 total lunar eclipses {{occur in}} a row with {{intervals}} of 6 lunations (semester), and {{this is called a}} tetrad. Giovanni Schiaparelli noticed that there are <b>eras</b> <b>when</b> such tetrads occur comparatively frequently, interrupted by <b>eras</b> <b>when</b> they are rare. [...] This variation takes about 6 centuries. Antonie Pannekoek (1951) offered an explanation for this phenomenon and found a period of 591 years. [...] Van den Bergh (1954) from Theodor von Oppolzer's Canon der Finsternisse found a period of 586 years. This happens to be an eclipse cycle; see Meeus [...] (1997). [...] Recently Tudor Hughes explained the variation from secular changes in the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit: the period for occurrence of tetrads is variable and currently is about 565 years; see Meeus III (2004) for a detailed discussion.|$|R

5|$|Ruffing turned {{forty years}} of age during the war, {{resulting}} in his discharge in June 1945. He rejoined the Yankees that month, signing for the same $20,000 salary ($ in current dollar terms) he earned in 1942. He made his first appearance with the Yankees since the 1942season in July 1945. Pitching for the Yankees as a spot starter in 1946, he had a 5–1 win-loss record and a 1.77 <b>ERA</b> <b>when</b> he suffered a broken kneecap from a line drive hit by Hank Majeski, and missed {{the remainder of the}} season.|$|E

5|$|The fault, {{which is}} aligned eastwest, is {{connected}} to the northsouth trending Wabash Valley Fault System at its eastern end. Seismographic mapping completed by geologists revealed monoclines, anticlines, and synclines, all of which suggest deformation during the Paleozoic <b>era,</b> <b>when</b> strike-slip faulting took place nearby. The fault runs along an ancient Precambrian terrane boundary. It was active mainly in the Late Pennsylvanian and Early Permian epochs around 300 million years ago.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} Somerton {{dates back to}} the Anglo-Saxon <b>era,</b> <b>when</b> it was an {{important}} political and commercial centre. After the Norman conquest of England the importance of the town declined, despite being the county town of Somerset in the late thirteenth century and early fourteenth century. Having lost county town status, Somerton then became a market town in the Middle Ages, whose economy was supported by transport systems using the River Parrett, and later rail transport via the Great Western Railway, and by light industries including glove making and gypsum mining.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the extreme}} {{difficulty}} of the competition, several stages of preparation are needed. The first is the food drop, when mushers and race officials position caches of food and supplies at race checkpoints. This is necessary because mushers may only use their supplies along the route, reflecting the Gold Rush <b>era,</b> <b>when</b> dog trains would resupply at points along the trail. One week after the food drop, all dogs participating in the race undergo a preliminary veterinarian inspection to ensure they are healthy enough to race 1,000miles in subarctic conditions. The final stage of formal preparation is {{two days before the}} race, when mushers pick their starting order from a hat.|$|E
5|$|By the 15th century, Bath's abbey {{church was}} {{dilapidated}} and Oliver King, Bishop of Bath and Wells, decided to rebuild it {{on a smaller}} scale in 1500. The new church was completed just a few years before Bath Priory was dissolved in 1539 by Henry VIII. The abbey church became derelict before being restored as the city's parish church in the Elizabethan <b>era,</b> <b>when</b> the city experienced a revival as a spa. The baths were improved and the city began to attract the aristocracy. A Royal charter granted by Queen Elizabeth I in 1590 confirmed city status.|$|E

5|$|Director Jewison can put {{his cards}} on the table, let his camera cut suspensefully to the players' intent faces, but a pool shark sinking a tricky shot into a side pocket {{undoubtedly}} offers more range. Kid also has a less compelling subplot. Away from the table, McQueen gambles on a blonde (Tuesday Weld) and on the integrity of his dealer pal, Karl Malden. Pressure comes from a conventionally vicious Southern gentleman (Rip Torn), whose pleasures include a Negro mistress, a pistol range adjacent to his parlor, and fixed card games. As Malden's wife, Ann-Margret spells trouble of another kind, though her naive impersonation of a wicked, wicked woman recalls the <b>era</b> <b>when</b> the femme fatale wore breastplates lashed together with spider web. By the time all the bets are in, Cincinnati Kid appears to hold a losing hand.|$|E
5|$|Dorset {{is largely}} rural with many small villages, few large towns and no cities. The only major urban {{area is the}} South East Dorset conurbation, which is {{situated}} at the south-eastern end of the county and is atypical of the county as a whole. It consists of the seaside resort of Bournemouth, the historic port and borough of Poole, the towns of Christchurch and Ferndown plus many surrounding villages. Bournemouth, the most populous town in the conurbation, {{was established in the}} Georgian <b>era</b> <b>when</b> sea bathing became popular. Poole, the second largest settlement (once the largest town in the county), adjoins Bournemouth to the west and contains the suburb of Sandbanks which has some of the highest land values by area in the world.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} mayoral election, there was support for Lane as a {{potential}} Democratic candidate for Vice President, though since {{he was born in}} what was by then a Canadian province he was ineligible under the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In an <b>era</b> <b>when</b> political convention delegates were far more free to make their own choices than they are today, Lane wrote that he had heard that he could gain the support of the New York delegation, which he declined to do. While returning to California from a trip to Washington, D.C., as an advocate for the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir project, he stopped in Austin, Texas, to confer with Democratic leaders and address the legislature. The New York Times saw this as part of a campaign to secure the vice-presidential nomination, and stated that he had been promised help from Texas.|$|E
