5|$|Following the Soviet Union's {{successful}} {{nuclear test}} in August 1949, the U.S. was considering {{a crash course}} to develop a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bomb.</b> The AEC's nine-member General Advisory Committee, chaired by J. Robert Oppenheimer, recommended unanimously against such a course, and Smyth {{was one of three}} of the five AEC commissioners to agree. Smyth urged Truman to endorse international control of nuclear weapons, but Truman decided instead to authorize a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bomb</b> program. In his autobiography, Smyth's Princeton colleague John Archibald Wheeler recalled that Smyth recruited him to the Ivy Mike <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bomb</b> project and expressed support for the project in response to the Soviet test.|$|E
5|$|As {{outlined}} in the 3,500-word Nichols letter, the hearing focused on 24 allegations, 23 of which dealt with Oppenheimer's Communist and left-wing affiliations between 1938 and 1946, including his delayed and false reporting of the Chevalier incident to authorities. The twenty-fourth charge related to {{his opposition to the}} <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bomb.</b> By including the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bomb,</b> the AEC changed the character of the hearing, by opening up an inquiry into his activities as a postwar government adviser.|$|E

5|$|Whether the {{information}} Fuchs passed {{relating to the}} <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bomb</b> would have been useful is still debated. Most scholars agree with Hans Bethe's 1952 assessment, which concluded {{that by the time}} Fuchs left the thermonuclear program in mid-1946, too little was known about the mechanism of the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bomb</b> for his information to be useful to the Soviet Union. The successful Teller-Ulam design was not devised until 1951. Soviet physicists later noted that they could see as well as the Americans eventually did that the early designs by Fuchs and Edward Teller were useless.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{detonation}} of {{the first}} Soviet fission bomb in August 1949, Fermi, along with Isidor Rabi, wrote a strongly worded report for the committee, opposing {{the development of a}} <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bomb</b> on moral and technical grounds. Nonetheless, Fermi continued to participate in work on the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bomb</b> at Los Alamos as a consultant. Along with Stanislaw Ulam, he calculated that not only would the amount of tritium needed for Teller's model of a thermonuclear weapon be prohibitive, but a fusion reaction could still not be assured to propagate even with this large quantity of tritium. Fermi was among the scientists who testified on Oppenheimer's behalf at the Oppenheimer security hearing in 1954 that resulted in denial of Oppenheimer's security clearance.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1950s, Bainbridge {{remained}} an outspoken proponent {{of civilian control}} of nuclear power and the abandonment of nuclear testing. In 1950 {{he was one of}} twelve prominent scientists who petitioned President Harry S. Truman to declare that the United States would never be the first to use the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bomb.</b> Bainbridge retired from Harvard in 1975.|$|E

5|$|With {{the success}} of Operation Hurricane, Britain became the third nuclear power after the United States and the Soviet Union. {{although}} production bombs would not be delivered to the RAF until November 1953, and a further two years would pass before the RAF had bombers capable of carrying them. Four weeks after Operation Hurricane, the United States successfully demonstrated a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bomb.</b> The technology mastered in Operation Hurricane was six years old, and with the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bomb</b> in hand, the US Congress saw no benefit in renewing cooperation. All the while Britain strove for independence, {{at the same time}} it sought interdependence in the form of a renewal of the Special Relationship with the United States. As successful as it was, Operation Hurricane fell short on both counts.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Bethe {{also played}} an {{important}} role in the development of the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bomb,</b> though he had originally joined the project with the hope of proving it could not be made. Bethe later campaigned with Albert Einstein and the Emergency Committee of Atomic Scientists against nuclear testing and the nuclear arms race. He helped persuade the Kennedy and Nixon administrations to sign, respectively, the 1963 Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (SALT I).|$|E
5|$|By 1949, Soviet-backed governments {{had already}} begun seizing control {{throughout}} Eastern Europe, forming such puppet states as the Hungarian People's Republic in Teller's homeland of Hungary, where much of his family still lived, on August 20, 1949. Following the Soviet Union's first test detonation of an atomic bomb on August 29, 1949, President Harry Truman announced a crash development program for a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bomb.</b>|$|E

5|$|By {{recasting}} {{a difference}} of judgment over {{the merits of the}} early work on the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bomb</b> project into a matter of a security risk, Teller effectively damned Oppenheimer in a field where security was necessarily of paramount concern. Teller's testimony thereby rendered Oppenheimer vulnerable to charges by a Congressional aide that he was a Soviet spy, which resulted in the destruction of Oppenheimer's career.|$|E
5|$|Emil Julius Klaus Fuchs (29 December 1911– 28 January 1988) was a German {{theoretical}} {{physicist and}} atomic spy who, in 1950, {{was convicted of}} supplying information from the American, British, and Canadian Manhattan Project to the Soviet Union during and shortly after the Second World War. While at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, Fuchs was responsible for many significant theoretical calculations relating to the first nuclear weapons, and later, early models of the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bomb.</b>|$|E
5|$|It was {{discovered}} in the debris of the first <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bomb</b> explosion in 1952, and named after Enrico Fermi, {{one of the pioneers}} of nuclear physics. Its chemistry is typical for the late actinides, with a preponderance of the +3 oxidation state but also an accessible +2 oxidation state. Owing to the small amounts of produced fermium and all of its isotopes having relatively short half-lives, there are currently no uses for it outside basic scientific research.|$|E

Chinese forces, claiming jurisdiction within a 12-mile exclusion zone of the islands, ordered the bombers to leave the area, but they refused, not recognizing jurisdiction.

5|$|On the AEC from 1949 to 1954, Smyth argued unsuccessfully {{against a}} crash course to develop the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bomb</b> and in favor of {{international}} control of nuclear weapons.

5|$|Teller {{returned}} to Los Alamos in 1950 {{to work on}} the project. He insisted on involving more theorists. but many of Teller's prominent colleagues, like Fermi and Oppenheimer, were sure that the project of the H-bomb was technically infeasible and politically undesirable. None of the available designs were yet workable. However Soviet scientists who had worked on their own <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bomb</b> have claimed that they developed it independently.|$|E
5|$|Truman's second inauguration was {{the first}} ever {{televised}} nationally. His second term was grueling as his opponents controlled Congress and his policy of rollback in Korea failed. The Soviet Union's atomic bomb project progressed much faster than had been expected and they detonated their first bomb on August 29, 1949. In response, on January 7, 1953, Truman announced the detonation of the first U.S. <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bomb,</b> which was much {{more powerful than the}} Soviets' atomic weapons.|$|E
5|$|Yet all {{the while}} Britain strove for independence, {{at the same time}} it sought {{interdependence}} in the form of a renewal of the Special Relationship with the United States. This was desired more than ever, as other countries recovered from the war and once again began to challenge Britain's status. As successful as it was, High Explosive Research fell short on both counts. The technology demonstrated at Monte Bello in October 1952 was already seven years old. The following month the United States tested Ivy Mike, a thermonuclear device. The British government would now have to decide whether to initiate its own <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bomb</b> programme. Penney, for one, feared that this would likely prove to be beyond the financial resources of Britain's war-ravaged economy. The successful British <b>hydrogen</b> <b>bomb</b> programme, and a favourable international relations climate caused by the Sputnik crisis, led to amendment of the United States Atomic Energy Act in 1958, and a resumption of the nuclear Special Relationship between America and Britain under the 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement.|$|E
