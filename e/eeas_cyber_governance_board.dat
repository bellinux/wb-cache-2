A <b>governance</b> <b>board</b> can be either a supervisory or an advisory board, this in line with the two tier governance structure that is used in the Netherlands. The resource based view is used to discuss the possible valuable resources of family SMEs and the way <b>governance</b> <b>boards</b> can influence these resources. Three functions of boards are distinguished: monitoring, resource and strategy. Especially the last two could be valuable for family SMEs. Hypotheses were tested on a sample of 370 Dutch family SMEs. Our results show that <b>governance</b> <b>boards</b> effects the existence of written strategic plans and the expected marketability of the firm. The data did not confirm a relation between a <b>governance</b> <b>boards</b> and expected short term sales growth...|$|R

40|$|AbstractGovernance can be {{considered}} as the way in which companies are directed and controlled. In any governance process, effective experience reuse is an increasingly important asset, representing source of competitive advantage in making decisions. As an example, an adequate level of experience is needed for taking decisions related to resource allocation and, in particular, for team allocation with regard to a specific problem. In this scenario, we propose an experience-based Decision Support System (DSS) supporting Governance processes (i. e. decision-making processes), capable of exploiting previous decisions made by the <b>governance</b> <b>board</b> for solving similar problems. The DSS relies on a semantic formalization of the characteristics of the resources to be allocated and of the problem to be solved. Consequently, when there is a new allocation problem, the DSS can identify the most suitable set of resources to employ. Among them, it is possible to select the best one for the specific problem by exploiting previous experiences of the <b>governance</b> <b>board.</b> The DSS uses pattern-mining techniques in order to discover association rules among different kind of resources, reflecting experiences of the <b>governance</b> <b>board</b> in taking such kind of decisions...|$|R
