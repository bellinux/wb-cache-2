5|$|<b>Forest</b> <b>fires</b> {{were viewed}} {{for many decades}} {{as a threat to}} {{protected}} areas such as forests and parks. As a better understanding of fire ecology developed after the 1960s, <b>forest</b> <b>fires</b> were understood to be a natural part of the ecosystem. The earlier policies of suppression resulted in the accumulation of dead and decaying trees and plants, which would normally have been reduced had fires been allowed to burn. Many species of plants and animals actually need wildfires to help replenish the soil with nutrients and to open up areas that allow grasses and smaller plants to thrive.|$|E

This research indicates that although <b>forest</b> <b>fire</b> has cross-country border impacts, <b>forest</b> <b>fire</b> discourses were dominated by home country issues rather than the concerns of global <b>forest</b> <b>fire</b> events. Further, although information about <b>forest</b> <b>fire</b> is widely available in the scientific journals, the “knowledge utilization” of this information remains low. To improve “knowledge utilization”, scientists can use different channels to disseminate information, in addition to scientific journals. While socialeconomic aspects are perceived to be the prime problem of <b>forest</b> <b>fire</b> in Indonesia, the minimal presentation of social scientists within <b>forest</b> <b>fire</b> discourse is a concern. To address these primary concerns within and outside scientific journals, the involvement of social scientists within the <b>forest</b> <b>fire</b> discourse is very important. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{forest is}} deemed as a {{precious}} and indispensable ecological resource, but <b>forest</b> <b>fire</b> {{which is of}} common occurrence {{all over the world}} can destroy forest resource and threaten human-living environment. It is urgent for <b>Forest</b> <b>Fire</b> Prevention Departments to adopt a monitoring system that can predict the occurrence and spread of <b>forest</b> <b>fire</b> so as to reduce the loss caused by <b>forest</b> <b>fire.</b> This paper illustrates a monitoring system for <b>forest</b> <b>fire</b> based on multi-sensor and 4 G network. The hardware design and software implementations of the monitoring system are presented based on ZigBee technology and 4 G communication technology. CC 2530 SOC is chosen to acquire the data and send it to 4 G network through which the data is transmitted to the remote monitoring server. By means of multi-sensor and multilevel data fusion, the system accomplishes <b>forest</b> <b>fire</b> early warning according to <b>forest</b> <b>fire</b> rating...|$|R
40|$|Many hazards {{happen in}} our daily life. They cause damages of property, loss of human life and {{environment}} problems. The emergency management plays {{a very important role}} when we face to these events. Spatial information plays a very important role in these emergency responses. Map is the most direct representation of spatial information. Symbology is the most intuitional and visual language in the map. In our paper <b>forest</b> <b>fire</b> emergency map is choosing as an example. <b>Forest</b> <b>fire</b> is one kind of emergency natural disasters which happened almost every day on the earth. Rapid response can avoid damages when detecting a <b>forest</b> <b>fire.</b> In order to show the <b>forest</b> <b>fire</b> information rapidly and easily understanding on the map. We try to design a suit of mapping symbols for the <b>forest</b> <b>fire.</b> According to <b>forest</b> <b>fire</b> special content, we can use four kinds of emergency map symbols: the basic geographical map symbols, the emergency events symbols, the emergency facilities related information symbols and the emergency command map symbols. At last we get a <b>forest</b> <b>fire</b> emergency map symbols. At last, four kinds of maps can be made to test these symbols, such as the <b>forest</b> <b>fire</b> risk evaluating map, the forest spreading map, the <b>forest</b> <b>fire</b> rapid response command map and the <b>forest</b> <b>fire</b> lost estimation map. The emergency symbols work very well in the <b>forest</b> <b>fire</b> rapid response. A lot of symbols are well-designed. But some of them need to re-design. In future we will provide a whole symbol library which can be used in the GIS software for emergency mapping. 1...|$|R

Attalea speciosa forms pure stands in many parts of Brazil where natural forest vegetation has been cleared. Similarly, stands of A.funifera in Bahia, Brazil (which are cultivated for piassava fibre) are managed using fire—the seedlings survive cutting and burning, and are able to dominate burned forest patches.|$|E

To study the correlation of <b>forest</b> <b>fire</b> and Asian dust, we surveyed information of Asian dust observations, <b>forest</b> <b>fire</b> statistics, fire danger rating index, weather data such as temperature, relative humidity and wind speed of the day occurring the <b>forest</b> <b>fire.</b> As a consequence of analysis, the regional frequency of Asian dust was the highest in Gyeonggi and Chungbuk divisions. Frequencies of <b>forest</b> <b>fire</b> occurrence by the Asian dust events were the highest in the day before three days of the Asian dust event.
