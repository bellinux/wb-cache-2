On his election loss, Chee was more opinionated than introspective. In an interview immediately after the announcement of the election results, Chee was critical of the 'vicious campaign' and personal attacks by leaders from the ruling party and the mainstream media. Sympathizers of this view have started an online petition (Singaporeans Against Gutter Politics) during the period leading up to the polling day.

The son of a shopkeeper, his father died in 1816 and he seemed to <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> lonely childhood. He {{received}} his basic education from C. L. Roth’s gymnasium in Nuremberg and was admitted to theological study at the University of Erlangen in 1826. He was heavily influenced by the Reformed professors of theology Christian Krafft and Thomas von Kempen. Ultimately, he was introduced to the Lutheran Confessions and became a Lutheran under the teaching of David Hollaz. In 1828 he spent a term at the University of Berlin, attracted not so much by the lectures of the professors as by the sermons of the famous preachers. Löhe graduated from the Erlangen in 1830, but waited until 1831 before receiving a pastoral assignment to Kirchenlamitz in Upper Franconia (Northeastern Bavaria).|$|E
25|$|The {{match in}} Sheffield {{produced}} an exciting finish as the Australians, needing 170 to win, {{had been reduced}} to 116 for nine before Gregory was joined by last man Ed Long. Against the odds, they put on 54 for the tenth wicket to win the game, Gregory scoring 41* and Long 13*. Yorkshire, featuring George Hirst and Wilfred Rhodes, {{went on to win the}} County Championship in 1919 so this was an outstanding performance by Collins' team. Yorkshire won the toss and batted first. Their opening pair of Rhodes (90) and Percy Holmes (71) shared 150 for the first wicket but finally Gregory dismissed Holmes and then, with six for 91, proceeded to bowl Yorkshire out for 224. The Australians began badly and were 59 for four before the middle order rallied and eventually reached 265 on the second day. A key innings was played by one of the bit-part players Eric Bull who scored a career-highest 42 at a crucial time from the end of day one and well into the second morning. Yorkshire scored 210 in their second innings and would <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> low score but for an outstanding effort by Hirst with 88. Yorkshire again struggled against Gregory who dismissed all the first six batsmen and finished with seven for 79, a match haul of thirteen for 170. The Australians began the fourth innings before lunch on the final day and were soon struggling after Collins was out without scoring and only Trenerry, with 39, made any contribution among the top order batsmen. The total was 71 for five when Bull came in and he played another valuable innings of 27 until he was out at 111 for eight. Gregory was joined by Winning who was out for nought at 116 for nine and this set up the remarkable climax to the game between Gregory and Long.|$|E

Labour migrants arriving prior to 1988 were generally literate in either English or Arabic, although few had completed secondary education. Many of the initial wave of refugees from the Somali Civil War who started to arrive from 1988 onwards were well educated, with many possessing secondary education and some holding degrees. According to the IPPR, the educational profile of Somali migrants subsequently changed again, because {{of the impact of the}} civil war on education in Somalia.

2500|$|Although polling day was 5 July, {{the results}} of the 1945 {{election}} did not become known until 26 July, owing to the need to collect the votes of those serving overseas.

Having lost the election, despite enjoying much support amongst the British population, he resigned as Prime Minister that evening, this time handing over to a Labour Government. Many reasons for his defeat have been given, key among them being that a desire for post-war reform was widespread amongst the population and that the man who had led Britain in war was not seen as the man to lead the nation in peace. Although the Conservative Party was unpopular, many electors appear to have wanted Churchill to continue as Prime Minister whatever the outcome, or to have wrongly believed that this would be possible.|$|E
