5|$|Delichon is an Old World genus {{with all}} three species {{breeding}} only in the Northern Hemisphere. The common house martin is a widespread migrant breeder across Europe, north Africa and all northern temperate Asia to Kamchatka. Its western subspecies D.u.urbicum winters in tropical Africa, and eastern D.u.lagopodum moves to southern China and Southeast Asia. The Asian house martin breeds further south than common house martin {{in the mountains of}} central and eastern Asia; its nominate subspecies winters in Southeast Asia, but the races breeding in the Himalayan and Taiwan may <b>just</b> <b>move</b> from the high mountains to lower altitudes. The Nepal house martin is resident in the mountains of southern Asia.|$|E
5|$|These are {{exclusively}} Old World species. The {{rock martin}} breeds throughout Africa {{and through the}} Middle East as far as Afghanistan and Pakistan, and is replaced by the dusky crag martin further east in India and Indochina. The Eurasian crag martin breeds from Iberia and northwesternmost Africa through southern Europe, the Persian Gulf and the Himalayas to southwestern and northeastern China. Northern populations of the Eurasian crag martin are migratory, with European birds wintering in north Africa, Senegal, Ethiopia and the Nile Valley, and Asian breeders going to southern China, the Indian subcontinent and the Middle East. Some European birds stay north of the Mediterranean, and, like populations in warmer areas such as India, Turkey and Cyprus, <b>just</b> <b>move</b> to lower ground after breeding. The dusky crag martin and rock are largely resident apart from local movements after breeding, when many birds descend to lower altitudes, although some pale northern rock martins from North African and southern Arabian may winter further south alongside the local subspecies in Ethiopia, Mali and Mauritania.|$|E

25|$|As {{part of a}} {{comprehensive}} assessment of flood risks caused by the River Don and its tributaries, the River Dearne Improvement Scheme was implemented between 1963 and 1973. It was recognised that simple enlargement of the river channel would not provide a satisfactory solution, as it would <b>just</b> <b>move</b> the problem to the River Don, and therefore a series of washlands were created, which could be progressively flooded if required, without affecting centres of population. Near the mouth of the river, Dearne Mouth washland, which is now known as the Denaby Ings Nature Reserve, was created in 1963, and a manually operated sluice allowed the flow of the river to be diverted through the floodbank and into the washland when there were high levels at the junction with the River Don. The sluice was rebuilt in 1973. Additional washlands were created at Harlington and North Ings, and the river was straightened and realigned.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} a {{technology}} that was incorporated into the controller was the touchscreen. It allows the player {{to be able to}} interact with the game differently than before. The person could move around in menus easier and they are also able to interact with different objects in the game. They can pick up some objects, equip others, or even <b>just</b> <b>move</b> the objects out of the players path. Another example is motion sensor where a persons movement is able to be captured and put into a game. Some motion sensor games are based on where the controller is. The reason for that is because there is a signal that is sent from the controller to the console or computer so that the actions being done can create certain movements in the game. Other type of motion sensor games are webcam style where the person can move around in front of it and the actions done are repeated in a character of the game you are playing as.|$|E

500|$|The {{lyrics of}} the {{original}} song were switched to fit the cause. The new lyrics include the line: [...] "A little sweat ain’t hurt nobody [...] Don't just stand there on the wall, everybody <b>just</b> <b>move</b> your body, move your body, move your body." [...] The song is a step-by-step flash dance-style workout that combines elements of hip hop music, Latin music as well as dancehall moves with traditional exercise. Nicole James of MTV Buzzworthy described [...] "Move Your Body" [...] as a [...] "kid-friendlier" [...] version {{of the original}}. Risa Dixon of Newsday praised the reworked version, calling it [...] "a fun, yet cardio-intensive workout song to get young people excited about exercising." ...|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the songs}} on the soundtrack were offered to Peter Chelsom, the 's director, for {{inclusion}} on the film. Producer Alfred Gough said, [...] "Peter Chelsom describes the Stewart family [...] as a bilingual family whose second language is music, and that's very true in this movie." [...] Chelsom says the film's numerous songs are tightly woven {{into the fabric of}} the story and the characters, which is why he believes the film will feel like a musical without being one. [...] "We continuously dance very close to the convention of a musical but are more integrated. Songs are going to sit within the film, not apart from the film. At times, you won't notice the music is happening; it'll <b>just</b> <b>move</b> the story along." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 2010, Rhimes {{stated that}} she did not feel Izzie's {{character}} arc—specifically her relationship with Alex—had fully concluded, and hoped to give proper closure to their relationship in the seventh season. She later confirmed that she had intended to kill off Izzie off-screen, but opted against this a day later as she felt that it would destroy Alex, rather than give him closure. Instead, she concluded: [...] "I'm open to seeing Izzie again. So if she [...] were to come back, we would be thrilled to [...] But if she doesn't, we'll <b>just</b> <b>move</b> on." [...] Heigl also went on to say in October 2010 that the character returning to show looks bleak because, [...] "that chapter is closed, and it's sad. And it's hard."

500|$|Lukather's {{approach}} to engineering his {{sound in the}} studio is usually simple. He is not known for doing {{a large number of}} takes or for incorporating much overdubbing—rather, he has a reputation for doing only single takes for many parts. He has said about this approach: [...] "If a solo didn't work—either because I didn't have the right sound, or because I wasn't inspired at that moment—I'd <b>just</b> <b>move</b> on. A part either works or it doesn't. You can't batter it into submission, or force inspiration to save you. It's always better to just surrender, and then come back later to give it a go with fresh ears." [...] Although he enjoys the technical mastery that is possible in the studio, Lukather prefers the dynamic of performing live on stage. He has stated that dynamics are the most important element of producing a recording with good sound quality.|$|E
500|$|Mona's visual {{actress in}} Max Payne 2 was Kathy Tong, a Hollywood model. [...] According {{to the first}} two games' writer Sam Lake, he [...] "did want to switch to Mona [...] but it was problematic. In the end, Max frames those {{sequences}} with his narration, saying that he doesn’t know exactly what happened, or what Mona did, {{but it must have}} been something like this. In other words, when you are playing Mona, you are actually experiencing Max’s guess of the events". Regarding Mona's possible survival at the end of Max Payne 2, Rockstar's Dan Houser stated that Max Payne 3 would [...] "not continue that aspect of the story. We toyed with figuring out some way, or doing something clever, and then [...] 'No, no, <b>just</b> <b>move</b> on from that bit of the story.' It really didn't work because there was no way of knowing the choices someone made." ...|$|E
500|$|On January 6, 2006, just a {{few days}} after the Gator Bowl, Virginia Tech {{officials}} dismissed Vick from the Virginia Tech football team, citing a December 17 traffic stop in which Vick was cited for speeding and driving with a revoked or suspended license. Vick hid the information from the team and the infraction was not discovered until January. The traffic stop, an earlier suspension from the team, and his unsportsmanlike conduct during the 2005 ACC Championship Game and 2006 Gator Bowl were used as grounds for his dismissal. In response to being dismissed from the team, Vick was quoted as saying, [...] "It's not a big deal. I'll <b>just</b> <b>move</b> on to the next level, baby". Vick appeared in one regular-season NFL game for the Miami Dolphins in 2006. The Dolphins did not renew his contract, and he has been out of football ever since.|$|E

500|$|... "Treehouse of Horror X" [...] was {{directed}} by Pete Michels and written by Donick Cary, Tim Long and Ron Hauge. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on Halloween,1999. [...] "I Know What You Diddily-Iddily-Did" [...] was conceived and written by former staff writer Cary. In the DVD commentary for the episode, Cary said that {{he came up with}} the segment after watching the 1997 horror film I Know What You Did Last Summer. [...] "I had just seen the movie and I was like, 'Hey, there you go.'" [...] he said. While Flanders serves as the segment's antagonist, the role would originally go to Grampa, who would chase Homer inside a roller disco. While Grampa does not appear in the segment, the Springfield Roller Disco is seen during the Simpsons escape from Flanders. Despite serving as writer for the segment, Cary left the series after finishing the first draft in order to work on the animated Austin Powers series, which never came to fruition. In his absence, the writing staff rewrote {{the last quarter of the}} segment and added the revelation that Flanders is a werewolf. In order to dispose of Ned Flanders' corpse, Homer throws his body into Flanders' house. After he is finished, he says [...] "That's the end of that chapter", a phrase that Cary often uses in his everyday life. [...] "That's just something that comes up a lot in my life is when no matter if it's a good or a bad thing, <b>just</b> <b>move</b> on" [...] he said.|$|E
