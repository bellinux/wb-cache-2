25|$|A lot {{of people}} just assume <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>some</b> Beatles and, you know, threw some Jay-Z on top of it or mixed it up or looped it around, but it's really a deconstruction. It's not an easy thing to do. I was obsessed with the whole project, that's all I was trying to do, see if I could do this. Once I got into it, I didn't think about {{anything}} but finishing it. I stuck to those two because I thought it would be more challenging and more fun and more of a statement to what you could do with sample alone. It is an art form. It is music. You can do different things, it doesn't have to be just what some people call stealing. It can be a lot more than that.|$|E
25|$|You have no {{idea what}} sending on those checks to me at this time. After {{fighting}} for an idea all your life I realize that your backing has saved it for me and meant to thank you with all my heart and soul for what you have done. It has been marvelous. So many letters have been written and not mailed and owing to having been in bed {{a great deal of time}} this summer, the paintings were about all I could muster up enough energy to do what I considered the best of my ability. Just before Stieglitz’s death <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>some</b> paintings to him that I considered as having something new in the. He immediately walked right up to them and spoke of the new ideas. His intuition in that way was remarkable and I am so glad to have been allowed to live during his and your lifetimes. It has been a great privilege for which I am truly thankful.|$|E
500|$|Describing the {{selection}} process, early contributor Chris Vrenna told Gannett News [...] "coming {{from the same}} emotional background, I feel, {{is more important than}} how well you can play your instrument. That's one reason that makes our shows more intense when we're up there ... We found people that understood that. It makes us stronger". [...] Reznor described his selection of the earliest incarnations of the live band by saying [...] "I'm not in the position to offer somebody a thousand dollars a week to rehearse ... So <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>some</b> young guys who were malleable, who would basically do what I want them to do but expand on it. [...] The only context I've worked with them in so far is, 'Here are the songs, here are your parts, learn them.' [...] " ...|$|E

She saw her first Jackson Pollock show. She found the American painters inspiring because of their vitality. Also [...] "in 1949-50, New York ... after war-torn Europe, it was sparkling, it was clean, it was very safe still." [...] She went to see Walter Gropius at Harvard, who was interested in her work. He offered to facilitate a scholarship for her for the Institute of Design in Chicago.|$|E

6000|$|In came Ethel. [...] "Oh, Margaret, {{will you}} look at these 'First Truths?' Do you think they would be easy enough? Shall <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>some</b> of the Parables and Miracles at once, or content myself with the book about 'Jane Sparks?'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's a basket; so {{we might}} pick 'em right away. I {{love to go}} up in trees and throw 'em down; and I know Cousin Henny will like {{cherries}} ever so much, and not scold a bit when <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>some</b> to her." ...|$|R

6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>some,</b> providentially, as {{it turned}} out. Again, I was declining tea-cake, when I could have sworn I heard the same voice (so low that {{it seemed like the}} admonition of a passing spirit) say-- ...|$|E

60|$|I go {{sometimes}} {{into the}} Bierhalle and restaurant called Old Munich. Not long {{ago it was}} a resort of interesting Bohemians, but now only artists and musicians and literary folk frequent it.

6000|$|Deborah {{stared at}} this most unwonted {{address on the}} part of her young lady; and Lucy, a sudden light {{breaking}} on her, smiled at Eleanor, and held up her finger.

6000|$|... "I'm {{nothing of}} the kind; but seeing how {{conflicting}} was current opinion, <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>some</b> trouble to find for myself a justification of the war. I couldn't help wondering why I went and killed people to whom I was personally quite indifferent." ...|$|E

5000|$|Locus {{magazine}} {{states that}} Green [...] "makes a virtue of taking everything to extremes". The author himself hinted at {{the extent to}} which his work should be taken as parodying the genre, saying: [...] "Just because <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>some</b> things seriously, it doesn't mean <b>I</b> have to <b>take</b> them too seriously.

60|$|Mr. Harris and <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>some</b> {{guides and}} porters and ascended to the Hotel des Pyramides, which is {{perched on the}} high moraine which borders the Glacier des Bossons.
