40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} {{study of the}} recently observed dynamical regimes of paramagnetic colloidal particles externally driven above a regular lattice of magnetic bubbles [P. Tierno, T. <b>H.</b> <b>Johansen,</b> and T. M. Fischer, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 038303 (2007) ]. An external precessing magnetic field alters the potential generated by {{the surface of the}} film in such a way to either drive the particle circularly around one bubble, ballistically through the array, or in triangular orbits on the interstitial regions between the bubbles. In the ballistic regime, we observe different trajectories performed by the particles phase locked with the external driving. Superdiffusive motion, which was experimentally found bridging the localized and delocalized dynamics, emerge only by introducing a certain degree of randomness into the bubbles size distribution...|$|E

A total of 197 taxa are presented (195 Rhodophyceae, 1 Phaeophyceae and 1 Chlorophyta; of these, 84 (or 43 %) represent new records for the flora, while 7 (or 3. 6 %) are new species. The new combination Jania subulata (J. Ellis et Solander) N’Yeurt et Payri is made for Haliptilon subulatum (J. Ellis et Solander) W. <b>H.</b> <b>Johansen.</b> Padina stipitata Tanaka et Nozawa (Phaeophyceae) and Codium saccatum Okamura (Chlorophyceae) are notable additions to the flora from deepwater habitats in the southern Australs; 56 taxa (or 28. 7 %) occur only in the Austral archipelago. The flora has most affinities {{with that of the}} Hawaiian Islands (Sørensen Index = 0. 30), followed by the Cook Islands and Samoa (SI = 0. 26 each) and the Solomon Islands (SI = 0. 25). There are some disjunct distribution patterns for several subtropical to temperate species, possibly suggesting special oceanic current routes between the southern Australs, Hawaii and the Southern Australian region...|$|E

40|$|The {{disqualification}} of Aeschylus 2 ̆ 7 s Suppliants as our earliest surviving tragedy has inevitably led to new {{understandings of}} the play 2 ̆ 7 s prominent chorus. While {{the use of the}} chorus as a main character was once seen as a direct link with tragedy 2 ̆ 7 s past and a conservative reflection of tragedy 2 ̆ 7 s origins, that fea­ture is now as likely to be viewed as an innovation. Thus <b>H.</b> Friis <b>Johansen</b> and E. <b>H.</b> Whittle, authors of the extensive 1980 commentary on the play, see the Suppliants as a 2 ̆ 2 grandiose experiment with a group instead of a single person as the main carrier of the action. 2 ̆ 2 In their view this experiment stands outside the history of tragedy, telling us nothing about the evolution of the genre; it does not derive from the tragedies that immediately preceded the Suppliants, and it exerted 2 ̆ 2 no influence on the development of Attic tragedy. 2 ̆...|$|R
40|$|Sepsis is {{a severe}} infection-induced {{systemic}} inflammatory syndrome. Inhibition of downstream inflammatory mediators of sepsis, e. g., TNF-α, has failed in clinical trials. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the effects of inhibiting CD 14, a key upstream innate immunity molecule, on the early inflammatory and hemostatic responses in a pig model of gram-negative sepsis. The study comprised two arms, whole live Escherichia coli bacteria and E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (n= 25 and n= 9 animals, respectively). The animals were allocated into treatment (anti-CD 14) and control (IgG isotype or saline) groups. Inflammatory, hemostatic, physiological, and microbiological parameters were measured. The proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL- 1 β, IL- 6, and IL- 8, but not the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL- 10, were efficiently inhibited by anti-CD 14. Furthermore, anti-CD 14 preserved the leukocyte count and significantly reduced granulocyte enzyme matrix metalloproteinase- 9 release and expression of the granulocyte membrane activation molecule wCD 11 R 3 (pig CD 11 b). The hemostatic markers thrombin-antithrombin III complexes and plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 were significantly attenuated. Anti-CD 14 did not affect LPS or E. coli DNA levels. This study documents that CD 14 inhibition efficiently attenuates the proinflammatory cytokine response and granulocyte activation and reverses the procoagulant state but does not interfere with LPS levels or bacterial counts in E. coli-induced sepsis. —Thorgersen, E.
