The objective of the work described in this report was to enrich the Urban Atlas dataset by including estimates of residential population at the vector polygon level. The estimation was done by downscaling, or disaggregating, census population reported at country-specific geometries (‘source geometry’) to the Urban Atlas land use/land cover polygons (‘target geometry’). The downscaling method {{can be described as}} a ‘smart’ areal interpolation which combined land use/land cover information from Urban Atlas, building densities from the European Settlement Map and census data. For numerous <b>Functional</b> <b>Urban</b> <b>Areas</b> for which population data were previously only available at coarse resolution (e. g. municipality, or 1 Km 2 grid cells), these newly released estimates represent a significant increase in spatial resolution, enabling diverse fine scale analyses for the whole Urban Atlas dataset.
