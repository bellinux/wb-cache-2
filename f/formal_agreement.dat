5|$|In {{its early}} years the league {{was little more than}} a <b>formal</b> <b>agreement</b> between teams to play each other and to declare a {{champion}} at season's end. Teams were still permitted to play non-league members. The 1920 season saw several teams drop out and fail to play through their schedule. Only four teams: Akron, Buffalo, Canton, and Decatur, finished the schedule. Akron claimed the first league champion, with the only undefeated record among the remaining teams.|$|E

5|$|The emperor's {{blessing of}} Palmyrene {{authority}} has been debated; Aurelian's acceptance of Palmyrene rule in Egypt may {{be inferred from}} the Oxyrhynchus papyri, which are dated by the regnal years of the emperor and Vaballathus. No proof of a <b>formal</b> <b>agreement</b> exists, and the evidence is {{based solely on the}} joint coinage- and papyri-dating. It is unlikely that Aurelian would have accepted such power-sharing, but he was unable to act in 271 due to crises in the West. His apparent condoning of Zenobia's actions may have been a ruse to give her {{a false sense of security}} while he prepared for war. Another reason for Aurelian's tolerance may have been his desire to ensure a constant supply of Egyptian grain to Rome; it is not recorded that the supply was cut, and the ships sailed to Rome in 270 as usual. Some modern scholars, such as , suggest that Cladius Gothicus had concluded a <b>formal</b> <b>agreement</b> with Zenobia which Aurelian ignored.|$|E
5|$|The optimal {{crossing}} point ran over Norwegian Talc's plant, and would involve placing the western pylon {{in the middle}} of their area. The company offered the authorities free land on the condition that they received a satisfactory intersection with the bridge. A <b>formal</b> <b>agreement</b> was reached in mid-1970. On the eastern side, an area development plan had to be made, which was approved on 19 May 1967. The necessary land not already owned by the municipalities was expropriated.|$|E

The take is not believed to threaten the local population. Japan had planned to kill 50 humpbacks in the 2007/08 season under its JARPA II research program. The announcement sparked global protests. After a visit to Tokyo by the IWC chair asking the Japanese for their co-operation in sorting out the differences between pro- and antiwhaling nations on the commission, the Japanese whaling fleet agreed to take no humpback whales during the two years {{it would take to}} reach a <b>formal</b> <b>agreement.</b>|$|E

Many older Holiday Inns still have those original Gulf stations on their properties, some in operation and some closed, but few operate today as Gulf stations.|$|E
5|$|The exact terms {{by which}} Libya gained Aouzou remain partly obscure, and are debated. The {{existence}} of a secret agreement between Tombalbaye and Gaddafi was revealed only in 1988, when the Libyan President exhibited an alleged copy of a letter in which Tombalbaye recognizes Libyan claims. Against this, scholars like Bernard Lanne have argued that there never was any sort of <b>formal</b> <b>agreement,</b> and that Tombalbaye had found it expedient {{not to mention the}} occupation of a part of his country. Libya was unable to exhibit the original copy of the agreement when the case of the Aouzou Strip was brought before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in 1993.|$|E
5|$|The {{order of}} the Junta not to proceed to the Viceroyalty of Peru was a de facto truce that would last while Castelli did not attack Goyeneche's army. Castelli tried to turn the {{situation}} into a <b>formal</b> <b>agreement,</b> which would imply recognition of the Junta as a legitimate interlocutor. Goyeneche agreed to sign an armistice for 40 days to allow time for Lima to ratify the agreement, but he actually used the time to reinforce his army. On 19 June, with the truce still in effect, an advanced royalist troop attacked positions at Juraicoragua. Castelli declared the truce broken and declared war on Peru.|$|E

Jackson only raised {{his bid to}} $47.5million, {{but he had the}} advantage of being able to close the deal faster, having completed due diligence of ATV Music prior to any <b>formal</b> <b>agreement.</b> He also agreed to visit Australia as a guest of Holmes à Court and appear on the Channel Seven Perth Telethon. Holmes à Court included some more assets and agreed to establish a scholarship in Jackson's name at a U.S. university. Branca closed the deal and purchased ATV Music on Jackson's behalf for $47.5million on August 10. 1985. In October 1985, Jackson fulfilled his contract provision to visit Perth, Western Australia and appear on the telethon, where he spoke briefly and met with two children.|$|E
5|$|Colonel Edward N. Hall was {{responsible}} for making the arrangements for the deployment. Two alternative plans were presented to Quarles, now the United States Deputy Secretary of Defense. One was for the United States to shoulder the cost, which would facilitate the fastest possible deployment. The other was for an {{agreement to be reached}} on sharing costs with the British, which would take longer. Quarles shared the plans with Eisenhower and Macmillan in Bermuda, and directed Hall to proceed with the deployment as fast as the first plan, but with the costs of the second. The result was a slower, more costly deployment. A <b>formal</b> <b>agreement</b> was drawn up on 17 December 1957, although {{it was not until the}} end of the month that it was definitely determined that Britain would receive Thor and not Jupiter missiles. The deployment of Thor missiles was codenamed Project Emily.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, the US Secretary of Defense, Charles E. Wilson, {{raised the}} {{possibility}} of a joint ballistic missile programme with the Minister of Supply, Duncan Sandys. This resulted in an agreement on collaboration being signed on 12 August 1954, and a British Medium Range Ballistic Missile (MRBM) development project codenamed Blue Streak. The United States pursued Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM) development in parallel. Indeed, it had two IRBM projects: the US Army's Jupiter and the USAF's Thor. When Sandys, now the Minister of Defence, visited the United States in January 1957, he found the Americans anxious to deploy IRBMs in Britain. Macmillan and Eisenhower agreed to do so during their summit in Bermuda in March 1957, and a <b>formal</b> <b>agreement</b> was drawn up on 17 December 1957, although {{it was not until the}} end of the month that it was definitely determined that Britain would receive Thor and not Jupiter missiles.

5|$|Lockheed Martin, Thales, STN Atlas, and Raytheon were {{approached}} to provide tenders {{to design and}} assemble a new combat system for the submarines, with all four submitting proposals during early 2000. In May 2000, after the Defence Science and Technology Organisation tested operational versions of the proposed combat software packages, the Lockheed and Thales tenders were eliminated, despite the Thales proposal being rated better than Raytheon's. After indepth testing of the remaining systems and observations of the systems in action, the German STN Atlas ISUS 90-55 aboard an Israeli Dolphin-class submarine and the American Raytheon CCS Mk2 aboard a USN Los Angeles-class submarine, {{it was decided that}} the STN Atlas system was the best for the class. However, political pressure from both the United States and Australia, questions about the security problems and possible leaks involved with a European combat system linked to American weapons, and desires to increase the political and military ties between Australia and the United States resulted in the cancellation of the tender program in July 2001 and the decision to enter a joint development program with the United States, with a <b>formal</b> <b>agreement</b> signed on 10 September 2001 at the Pentagon.|$|E
5|$|From early April 1965, Ubon {{became an}} {{important}} base for United States Air Force (USAF) attacks on North Vietnam during the Vietnam War, and No.79 Squadron became part of an integrated air defence system controlled by the USAF on 25June. This changed {{the status of the}} squadron's presence in Thailand, and RAAF Headquarters assessed that the North Vietnamese would be justified in regarding it as forming part of the air campaign against their country. Due to the threat of counter-attacks on Ubon, the base's ground defences were upgraded during 1966; this included the construction of defensive positions for No.79 Squadron's aircraft and personnel as well as the deployment of a detachment of RAAF airfield defence guards. While the squadron did not play {{an active role in the}} war, it supported the US effort by providing air defence for Ubon and taking part in exercises with USAF aircraft in which the Sabres adopted tactics used by North Vietnamese MiG-17 fighters. In December 1965 the commander of the United States Pacific Air Forces, General Hunter Harris, Jr., wrote to the chief of the RAAF, Air Marshal Alister Murdoch, to suggest that No.79 Squadron join the USAF operations against the Ho Chi Minh trail in southern Laos which were being covertly conducted by Ubon-based aircraft. The Thai Government indicated that it would allow the squadron to be used for this purpose as long as the Australian operations were conducted without a <b>formal</b> <b>agreement</b> or any public announcement. On 2March 1966 the Australian Cabinet decided to reinforce the Army and RAAF force in South Vietnam, but rejected the option of expanding the scope of RAAF operations in Thailand. This decision was made on the grounds that the expanded force in South Vietnam and existing deployments to Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore represented the maximum forces Australia could commit to the region.|$|E
