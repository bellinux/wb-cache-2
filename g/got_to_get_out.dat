5|$|What's So Amazing About Grace? sold well at {{secular and}} Christian stores. Its {{popularity}} in the United Kingdom grew in 2003, when the impending Iraq War boosted sales of religious literature in the country. That March, it was the seventh-bestselling religious book in the UK, behind Rick Warren's The Purpose Driven Life, John Ortberg's If You Want to Walk on Water, You've <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Get</b> <b>Out</b> of the Boat and Eugene H. Peterson's The Message. What's So Amazing About Grace? is Yancey's best-known book, having sold more than 15million copies by 2006. Initially, the book was especially popular among baby boomers. Its popularity helped increase sales of Yancey's 2000 book Reaching for the Invisible God, which appeared on religion bestseller lists immediately after publication. What's So Amazing About Grace? {{is one of several}} books by Yancey that have become international bestsellers.|$|E
500|$|According to Experience bassist Noel Redding, Hendrix {{told him}} it was about Hendrix's girlfriend in high school, Betty Jean Morgan. [...] Jimi's brother, Leon Hendrix, also felt that it was about Betty Jean, but also {{included}} her sister Maddy, although their house was brown. Shadwick suggests that the song was inspired by Linda Keith, Keith Richards' then-girlfriend and early Hendrix supporter. [...] Keith referred to her friend's Manhattan apartment, with its red velvet walls and decor, as the [...] "red house", and the two frequently stayed there during the summer of 1966. In London in 1970, Hendrix met up with Keith and when he performed [...] "Red House" [...] at the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival, he dedicated the song to her and added [...] "I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of here, because my Linda don't live here no more" [...] to the lyrics. However, Billy Cox, longtime friend and bassist for Hendrix's post-Experience groups, explained, [...] "As far as I know, 'Red House' didn't have any significance in reference to a particular person, place or thing. [...] It was just a blues number that Jimi put together".|$|E
500|$|On 30 September 1942, Hauptmann Marseille {{was leading}} his Staffel on a Stuka escort mission {{covering}} {{the withdrawal of}} the group and relieving the outward escort, III./Jagdgeschwader 53 (JG 53), which had been deployed to support JG 27 in Africa. Marseille's flight was vectored onto Allied aircraft in the vicinity but the opponent withdrew and did not take up combat. Marseille vectored the heading and height of the formation to Neumann who directed III./JG 27 to engage. Marseille heard 8./JG 27 leader Werner Schröer claim a Spitfire over the radio at 10:30. While returning to base, his new Messerschmitt Bf 109G-2/trop's cockpit began to fill with smoke; blinded and half asphyxiated, he was guided back to German lines by his wingmen, Jost Schlang and Lt Rainer Pöttgen. Upon reaching friendly lines, [...] "Yellow 14" [...] had lost power and was drifting lower and lower. Pöttgen called out after about 10 minutes that they had reached the White Mosque of Sidi Abdel Rahman, and were thus within friendly lines. At this point, Marseille deemed his aircraft no longer flyable and decided to bail out, his last words to his comrades being [...] "I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> now, I can't stand it any longer".|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't know; but we've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> him <b>out</b> of town by the {{shortest}} cut, an' I reckon that'll be Thirty-fourth Street Ferry. How {{much money you}} fellers got?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Two acquaintances of Markhasev, Sara Peters and Michael Chang, {{testified against}} {{him at the}} grand jury. Peters and her boyfriend, Eli Zakaria (who refused to testify, invoking his Fifth Amendment right to not {{incriminate}} himself), were with Markhasev {{on the night of}} the murder and were high on cocaine and heroin. She testified they had stopped to use the pay phone at a park-and-ride lot about [...] from where Cosby had pulled over to fix his flat tire. Peters testified that while Zakaria was on the phone, Markhasev walked off without saying where he was going. Within a few minutes, Peters heard a loud noise like a car backfiring, and Markhasev ran back to the car, saying, [...] "Let's go. We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of here. Let's go." [...] Markhasev refused to tell them what had happened, but they stopped at a wooded area that matched the description of where the murder weapon was later discovered.|$|E
2500|$|I became {{terrified that}} I {{was going to}} be a full-time, bomb-throwing {{terrorist}} if I stayed [...] because it was the beginning of really bad times in America. It was '66–'67, it was the first police riot in Los Angeles.... In college my major was political science, so my brain worked that way.... And I drove around this little English Hillman Minx—top down—and every night I'd be hauled over by the cops. Up against the wall, and all this stuff. They had this monologue with me; it was never a dialogue. It was that I was a long-haired drug addict living off some rich guy's foolish daughter. And I said, [...] "No, I work in advertising. I make twice as much as you do." [...] Which is a stupid thing to say to a cop....And it was like an epiphany. I suddenly felt what it was like to be a black or Mexican kid living in L.A. Before that, I thought I knew what the world was like, I thought I knew what poor people were, and then suddenly it all changed because of that simple thing of being brutalized by cops. And I got more and more angry and I just felt, I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of here—I'm a better cartoonist than I am a bomb maker. That's why so much of the U.S. is still standing.|$|E

6000|$|... "'Well,' I says, 'you're {{still on}} the old track, I see, looking for work. Take care you don't 'ave an {{accident}} {{one of these days}} and run up agen it before you've <b>got</b> time <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of its way.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of here," [...] was Sam's comment. Already {{they were}} {{standing}} in water up to their ankles. [...] "We've got to find higher ground." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Some {{kind of a}} watchman," [...] {{answered}} Loring. [...] "We have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of {{this neighborhood}} in railroad time or the jig's up," [...] he added.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, there isn't. We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> right <b>out</b> of this. Hurry on your things. The wind is rising, and we {{must make}} Wheatland by five o'clock. I came out to hold down my claim, but it ain't worth it. I reckon I've {{squeezed}} all the juice out of this lemon. This climate is a little boisterous for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At it again, eh? Throwing {{bouquets}} at yourselves." [...] Del Bishop {{grinned at}} them, {{and made to}} depart {{as quickly as he}} had come. [...] "But twist yourselves. Some sick men in a cabin down here. <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> 'em <b>out.</b> You're needed. And don't be all day about it," [...] he shouted over his shoulder as he disappeared among the trees.|$|R
6000|$|He {{reflected}} for a space. [...] "It's a smash-up, Ann. More {{likely than}} not, Ann, 'e's left us over'ead in debt. We <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of it just 'ow we can....|$|E

5000|$|His son Barclay H Warburton II was {{the first}} American to serve at the Ecole Militaire Saint Cyr during this same time, while both were serving in Paris at the same time, he {{is known to have}} remarked to his father, Major Warburton [...] "You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> me <b>out</b> of here; we are still {{training}} on horses, and you know I want to fly." [...] (Which he then did so do) ...|$|R
5000|$|... "If {{there was}} any team you would play me against, {{it would be the}} White Sox", Linz said later. By his own account, into which he admits he has {{incorporated}} others' reminiscences over the years, he was [...] "resentful", but he was also aware that despite his hitting success, his fielding had been deficient, and he believes the pitchers had complained to the manager. [...] "Yogi started <b>getting</b> pressure <b>to</b> put Tony Kubek back in. Somebody—maybe Whitey Ford—said 'You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Phil <b>out</b> of there.|$|R

5000|$|In May 2013, {{recorded}} audio {{of discussions}} with UltimateBet management {{was released by}} Travis Makar where Hamilton and other management can be heard discussing the scandal and the plans to cover up known conspirators and participants as well as aiming to reduce the declared or refunded amount of the fraud.

2500|$|After Richardson was {{unexpectedly}} {{removed from}} command in January 1941, Curts hoped {{to leave the}} fleet staff and return to sea. When Richardson's replacement, Admiral Husband E. Kimmel, summoned Curts to the flagship and asked, [...] "Young man, {{would you like to}} be on my staff?" [...] Curts firmly answered, [...] "Hell, no!" [...] Taken aback, Kimmel retorted, [...] "You've <b>got</b> <b>to.</b> There's no <b>getting</b> <b>out</b> of it." [...] In reply, Curts muttered, [...] "Oh, hell!"

6000|$|... "We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of this," [...] he said. His {{voice sounded}} like a man's whose throat has been {{scorched}} by many and long potations. It frightened him, but he limply lifted a shaking paddle and shoved off.|$|E

5000|$|Four of the Bears' {{offensive}} starters suffered injuries {{during the}} game: Roberto Garza (right ankle) and Matt Slauson (left ankle) {{did not play}} after the first half, Alshon Jeffery (hamstring) departed in the third quarter, while Marshall (right ankle) was hurt after being tackled. Conte received scrutiny after the game for failing to tackle Jackson, but defended himself by saying, [...] "It was a play where it's {{the end of the}} game - I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the ball <b>out</b> or something. If I hit him, it's a field goal no matter what, so I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> try and <b>get</b> the ball <b>out.</b> It's a desperation play where I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> try and punch the ball or something." ...|$|R
5000|$|He won an Oscar for Ed Wood (1994), a biopic {{in which}} he plays actor Bela Lugosi. Landau {{researched}} the role of Lugosi by watching about 25 old Lugosi movies and studying the Hungarian accent, which contributed to Lugosi's decline in acting. [...] "I began to respect this guy and pity him," [...] said Landau. [...] "I saw the humor in him. This, for me, became a love letter to him, because he never <b>got</b> a chance <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> of that. I <b>got</b> a chance <b>to</b> make a comeback in my career. And I'm giving him one. I'm giving him the last role he never got." ...|$|R
500|$|A {{major concern}} with the second act was the {{effectiveness}} of the characters He and She (later called by Rodgers [...] "Mr. and Mrs. God"), before whom Billy appeared after his death. Mr. and Mrs. God were depicted as a New England minister and his wife, seen in their parlor. The couple was still part of the show at the Boston opening. Rodgers said to Hammerstein, [...] "We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> God <b>out</b> of that parlor". When Hammerstein inquired where he should put the deity, Rodgers replied, [...] "I don't care where you put Him. Put Him on a ladder for all I care, only <b>get</b> Him <b>out</b> of that parlor!" [...] Hammerstein duly put Mr. God (renamed the Starkeeper) atop a ladder, and Mrs. God was removed from the show. Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest terms this change a mistake, leading to a more fantastic afterlife, which was later criticized by The New Republic as [...] "a Rotarian atmosphere congenial to audiences who seek not reality but escape from reality, not truth but escape from truth".|$|R
