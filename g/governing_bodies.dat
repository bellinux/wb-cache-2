This shift, which is that <b>governing</b> <b>body</b> members became the representatives of business corporations opened the possibility of discussion about the nature of authorization of <b>governing</b> <b>body</b> to act on behalf of the trade corporation and about the possibility of acting beyond its powers. My thesis was called "A <b>governing</b> <b>body</b> acting beyond its powers". I used as a base for this work the wide authorization that <b>governing</b> <b>body</b> possesses in acting on behalf of the trade corporation and its possible limitations by law. Besides <b>governing</b> <b>body</b> acting beyond its powers I focused in this work on two other types of acts that although they are done within its competence, aren't done in accordance with the law and the partnership agreement. Work has been divided into three main chapters. In the chapter about <b>governing</b> <b>body</b> acting beyond its powers I examined the possibility of <b>governing</b> <b>body</b> to act beyond its powers in relation to limitation of authorization that <b>governing</b> <b>body</b> possesses in acting on behalf of the trade corporation and the applicable law.

5|$|The Fast5 Series is a {{competition}} {{among the top}} six national netball teams, as ranked by the INF World Rankings.

The All England Netball Association covers air travel, accommodation, food and local travel expenses for all teams, while the respective netball <b>governing</b> <b>bodies</b> cover player allowances. It is held over three days, with each team playing each other once during the first two days in a round-robin format. The four highest-scoring teams advance to the semi-finals; the winners face each other in the Grand Final. The competition features modified fastnet rules and has been likened to Twenty20 cricket and rugby sevens. A new format featuring shorter matches with modified rules was designed to make the game more appealing to spectators and television audiences. The World Netball Series was held annually in England from 2009 to 2011.|$|E
