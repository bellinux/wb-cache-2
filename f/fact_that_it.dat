5|$|Tipu's Tiger {{is notable}} {{as an example}} of early musical automata from India, and also for the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was {{especially}} constructed for Tipu Sultan.|$|E
5000|$|The name [...] "playa" [...] means {{beach in}} Spanish, which {{alludes to the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> based on the Spanish SEAT Ibiza.|$|R

5|$|Although Dean {{was still}} a {{hurricane}} and was expected to re-strengthen slightly before making its second landfall, the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had weakened caused some residents to let down their guard. As a result, residents of Veracruz and Campeche were much less prepared for the storm than those on the Yucatán Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} for {{the album was}} generally favorable, with several reviewers pointing out the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> highly resembled the band's debut album. Critics also said the album was less groundbreaking than their debut but had humorous and enjoyable pieces. The album peaked at 148 on the Billboard 200 despite its critical acclaim {{as well as the}} band members expecting more commercial success.|$|E
5|$|Due to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> mainly serves Aqueduct Racetrack, {{the station}} is not well-used {{compared}} to other stations in the system. During the 1970s ridership at the station declined, from 1.1 million passengers in 1975 to 573,000 in 1979.|$|E

5|$|Fleming {{developed}} the James Bond character more in Goldfinger {{than in the}} previous six novels, presenting him as a more complex individual, whilst also bringing out a theme of Bond as Saint George. The Saint George theme is echoed by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is a British agent sorting out an American problem.|$|E
5|$|S.thiersii may be {{gathered}} inadvertently and {{thought to be}} edible due to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> grows on lawns among grasses. This {{is in contrast to}} Amanita species which grow around trees and are thus usually seen in forests. It can be distinguished from other white fungi growing in grassland by its fluffy cap, though the white veil fragments may eventually get washed away by rain.|$|E
5|$|Thio {{also argued}} that without a constitutionally {{expressed}} right to vote, the judiciary is handicapped in interpreting this implied right, given its conservative approach to reading the Constitution and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is unlikely to appeal to normative ideas such as representative democracy.|$|E

5|$|Above {{the central}} figure shines a single small star {{at the very top}} of the picture, serving as a symbol of further hope beyond that of {{the central figure}} herself. The {{distance}} of the star from the central figure, and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is outside her field of vision even were she not blindfolded, suggests an ambiguity. It provides an uplifting message to the viewer that things are not as bad for the central character as she believes, and introduces a further element of pathos in that she is unaware of hope existing elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Adrastea {{is one of}} the few moons in the Solar System {{known to}} orbit its planet in less than the length of that planet's day. It orbits at the edge of Jupiter's Main Ring and is thought to be the main {{contributor}} of material to the Rings of Jupiter. Despite observations made in the 1990s by the Galileo spacecraft, very little is known about the moon's physical characteristics other than its size and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is tidally locked to Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|After much fanfare, Muhammad departs jannah airport, {{riding a}} buraq, or winged horse. The Archangel Gabriel accompanies him. On the way, they {{encounter}} a Soviet spacecraft. Hearing {{that they are}} infidels, Muhammad approaches to investigate, only to crash into the spacecraft, obliterating it and the buraq and killing the three cosmonauts; Muhammad and Gabriel are able to catch a cloud. Later, they pass Jakarta, which Gabriel describes as the most sinful place on Earth. Angered by Gabriel's statement that less than a million of Indonesia's 90 million Muslims are true believers, {{as well as the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is the birthplace of Nasakom, Muhammad declares that Islam will never die and waits on the cloud.|$|E

5000|$|Pomet (1548 or 1553) - some Croatian historiographers {{argue that}} Pomet is indeed Marin's oldest play, his debut, while others disagree. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> lost {{makes it harder}} to {{classify}} it.|$|R
5000|$|The {{ambiguity}} of the term shamayim in the Hebrew Bible, and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> a plural word, give [...] "heavens" [...] various interpretations regarding its nature, notably the ascension of the prophet Elijah.|$|R
5|$|Almost {{nothing is}} known about the {{behaviour}} of Newton's parakeet, but it is probable that it was similar to that of other members of its genus. Leguat mentioned that the parrots of the island ate the nuts of the bois d'olive tree (Cassine orientalis). Tafforet also stated that the parrots ate the seeds of the bois de buis shrub (Fernelia buxifolia), which is endangered today, but was common all over Rodrigues and nearby islets during his visit. Newton's parakeet may have fed on leaves as the related echo parakeet does. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> survived long after Rodrigues had been heavily deforested shows that its ecology was less vulnerable than that of, for example, the Rodrigues parrot.|$|E
5|$|Although {{polyadenylation}} is seen {{in almost}} all organisms, it is not universal. However, the wide distribution of this modification and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is present in organisms from all three domains of life implies that the last universal common ancestor of all living organisms, it is presumed, had some form of polyadenylation system. A few organisms do not polyadenylate mRNA, which implies that they have lost their polyadenylation machineries during evolution. Although no examples of eukaryotes that lack polyadenylation are known, mRNAs from the bacterium Mycoplasma gallisepticum and the salt-tolerant archaean Haloferax volcanii lack this modification.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of Carter and Rosas' writing, vision had not been {{directly}} studied, but field observations show the animal primarily hunts by sight; above water, {{it is able to}} recognize observers at great distances. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is exclusively active during the day further suggests its eyesight should be strong, to aid in hunting and predator avoidance. In other otter species, vision is generally normal or slightly myopic, both on land and in water. The giant otter's hearing is acute and its sense of smell is excellent.|$|E
5000|$|Workman also {{discussed}} {{his love for}} Canada stating, [...] "I love Canada. I've got a maple-leaf tattoo. I like the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> safe there, <b>that</b> you don't {{have to think about}} getting mugged.".|$|R
5000|$|Rolling Stone named Nuts! {{one of the}} 12 best movies {{they saw}} at Sundance 2016, saying “the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it’s</b> all true didn’t stop Lane’s film from ending with the best twist of this year’s fest.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Dub-L {{produced}} Aesop Rock's first album, Music for Earthworms, in 1997. Dub-L {{has said}} that he is in possession of the masters but will not re-release it, because he likes the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> [...] "rare and legendary." ...|$|R
5|$|Blöndal & Benedikz (2007) {{note that}} most of the Greece runestones are from Uppland and relate it to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was the most common area to start a journey to Greece, and the area from which most Rus' originated. However, as noted by Jansson (1987), the fact {{that most of}} these runestones were raised in Uppland and Södermanland does not {{necessarily}} mean that their number reflects the composition of the Scandinavians in the Varangian Guard. These two provinces are those that have the greatest concentrations of runic inscriptions.|$|E
5|$|Book XI covers {{human beings}}, portents and transformations. Isidore derives human beings (homo) from the Latin for soil (humus), as in Genesis 2:7 {{it says that}} man is made from the soil. Urine (urina) gets its name either from the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> can burn (urere) the skin or, Isidore hedges, that {{it is from the}} kidneys (renes). Femina, meaning woman, comes from femora/femina meaning thighs, as this part of the body shows she is not a man. The Latin for {{buttocks}} is clunis as they are near the large intestine or colon (colum).|$|E
5|$|Carbon dating {{carried out}} at the University of Edinburgh dated the skull to between 1650 and 1880, while the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had been {{deposited}} {{on top of a}} layer of Victorian tiles suggested that it belonged to the end of this era. The skull had fracture marks consistent with Webster's account of throwing Thomas down the stairs, and it was found to have low collagen levels, consistent with it being boiled. In July 2011, the coroner concluded that the skull was indeed that of Thomas. DNA testing was not possible as she had died childless and no relatives could be traced; in addition, there was no record of where the rest of her body had been buried.|$|E

5000|$|According to Dan Challender of the International Union for Conservation of Nature's {{pangolin}} specialist group, [...] "The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> illegal isn't {{played down}} and is even attractive, because it adds this element that you live beyond the law." ...|$|R
5000|$|The name of {{the album}} is {{pronounced}} [...] "five deep", not [...] "vee deep" [...] and refers to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> the band's fifth album and also that they became a five-piece following the departure of Gerry Cott.|$|R
