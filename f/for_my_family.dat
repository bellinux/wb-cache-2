He cited his family as the reason, saying: “I’ve always put music first in my life – but the time has come now <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>family</b> to take the top spot”. It was the band's initial intention that Richards would not be replaced instantly and that the band would only look for a touring member to play for the band. However, it was announced on that Pat Lundy would be joining the band as Richards' replacement. Lundy is the former drummer of London-based heavy metal band Rise to Remain, having left the band in January 2012. After being contacted by the band to come to audition in Cardiff for the role, Pat learned their whole setlist in 7 days for the audition. Whilst the line up change occurred the band was recording and mixing their follow up to their fifth studio album. Across the year the band made few live appearances as they were working on the album, performing at Wakestock in North Wales, both the northern and southern dates of Slam Dunk Festival 2012 and the UK Warped Tour festival at the Alexandra Palace in London on 10 November 2012.|$|E

500|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} of 1747, the Prince of Wales again campaigned actively for the opposition but Pelham's party won easily. Like his father before him, the Prince entertained opposition figures at his house in Leicester Square. When the Prince of Wales died suddenly in 1751, his eldest son, Prince George, became heir apparent. The king commiserated with the Dowager Princess of Wales and wept with her. As her son would not reach the age of majority until 1756, a new British Regency Act was passed to make her regent, assisted by a council led by the Duke of Cumberland, in case of George II's death. The king also made a new will, which provided for Cumberland to be sole regent in Hanover. After {{the death of his}} daughter Louisa {{at the end of the}} year, George lamented, [...] "This has been a fatal year <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>family.</b> I lost my eldest son– but I am glad of it...
