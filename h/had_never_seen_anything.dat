He recounted their meeting:I <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> so beautiful in my life—tall, slim, auburn hair, up-tilted nose, lovely {{mouth and the}} most enormous grey eyes I had ever seen. It really happened {{the way it does}} when written by the worst lady novelists... I goggled. I had difficulty swallowing and had champagne in my knees.|$|E

The Executive Director of Saint Francis House, Karen LaFrazia, {{said that this}} was a very rare occurrence and that in her tenure of more than a decade, she <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> like this and that the environment is safe and a haven for many hundreds of people every day. The people involved in the incident were not regular guests of Saint Francis House.|$|E

His curveball was voted {{the best in the}} Major Leagues in a player poll {{conducted}} by Sports Illustrated in 2005. Alex Rodriguez once stated that he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> like Zito's curveball, commenting: [...] "It's such a high one, and it drops three to four feet. You might as well not even look for it because you're not going to hit it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{encounter}} {{between the two}} courts was marked by ritual exchanges of costly gifts and a sustained display of ballets, jousts, mock battles, and decorative arts. Several accounts of the Bayonne entertainments survive. One spectacle, mounted on the Bidasoa river, is a particularly famous example of Catherine’s entertainments as ephemeral works of art. The entertainments began with a banquet on the Île d’Aguineau. As guests were ferried on decorated boats to the island, they passed, among other spectacles, Arion riding two dolphins, harpoonists spearing an artificial whale that spouted red wine, and six tritons sitting on a giant turtle, blowing conch shells. Charles IX was transported on a barge dressed {{to look like a}} floating fortress. The banquet was followed by a ballet of nymphs and satyrs. Brantôme reported that the [...] "magnificence was such in everything that the Spaniards who are very contemptuous of all others save their own swore that they <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> finer".|$|E
500|$|The {{first result}} {{had already been}} {{determined}} by G. Bauer in 1859. The second was new to Hardy, and was derived from a class of functions called hypergeometric series, which had first been researched by Leonhard Euler and Carl Friedrich Gauss. Hardy found these results [...] "much more intriguing" [...] than Gauss's work on integrals. After seeing Ramanujan's theorems on continued fractions on the last page of the manuscripts, Hardy commented that the theorems [...] "defeated me completely; I <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> in the least like them before". He figured that Ramanujan's theorems [...] "must be true, because, {{if they were not}} true, no one would have the imagination to invent them". Hardy asked a colleague, J. E. Littlewood, {{to take a look at}} the papers. Littlewood was amazed by Ramanujan's genius. After discussing the papers with Littlewood, Hardy concluded that the letters were [...] "certainly the most remarkable I have received" [...] and said that Ramanujan was [...] "a mathematician of the highest quality, a man of altogether exceptional originality and power". One colleague, E. H. Neville, later remarked that [...] "not one [...] could have been set in the most advanced mathematical examination in the world".|$|E

500|$|O'Bannon soon {{accepted}} {{an offer to}} work on Alejandro Jodorowsky's adaptation of Dune, a project which took him to Paris for six months. Though the project ultimately fell through, it introduced him to several artists whose work gave him ideas for his science-fiction story including Chris Foss, H. R. Giger, and Jean [...] "Moebius" [...] Giraud. O'Bannon was impressed by Foss's covers for science fiction books, while he found Giger's work [...] "disturbing": [...] "His paintings {{had a profound effect}} on me. I <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> that was quite as horrible and at the same time as beautiful as his work. And so I ended up writing a script about a Giger monster." [...] After the Dune project collapsed, O'Bannon returned to Los Angeles to live with Shusett and the two revived his Memory script. Shusett suggested that O'Bannon use one of his other film ideas, about gremlins infiltrating a B-17 bomber during World War II, and set it on the spaceship as the second half of the story. The working title of the project was now Star Beast, but O'Bannon disliked this and changed it to Alien after noting the number of times that the word appeared in the script. He and Shusett liked the new title's simplicity and its double meaning as both a noun and an adjective. Shusett came up with the idea that one of the crew members could be implanted with an alien embryo that would burst out of him; he thought this would be an interesting plot device by which the alien could get aboard the ship.|$|E
500|$|A {{group of}} four or five {{teenagers}} aged between 14 and 16 claim to have been playing near a cave in Cerro Azul, Panama when the creature emerged. They say that it approached them, and, fearing for their safety, they attacked the creature with sticks and rocks, killing it. They claim that they then threw its corpse into a pool of water before leaving the area. They later returned and took photographs of the creature's corpse, before sending the pictures to Telemetro, a Panamanian television station. Virginia Wheeler, writing for The Sun, claimed that the discovery [...] "sparked fear and confusion" [...] in the town. According to some sources, subsequent photographs were taken of the creature after it had further decomposed; however, doubts have been expressed about whether the later photos were of the same specimen. A few days after the photographs were taken, one of the teenagers gave a different account in an interview with Telemetro Reporta, saying [...] "I was in the river and I felt something grabbing my legs ... We took it {{out of the water and}} started throwing rocks and sticks at it. We <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> like that." [...] The photographs show a pale creature that is mostly hairless, with a rubbery body. It has [...] "revolting features"; a snub-nose and long arms. Writers for the Huffington Post said that while the head is clearly animal, the torso is [...] "strange", while the limbs are reminiscent of thin human arms. Writers for WBALTV.com compared it to both a [...] "small, portly" [...] version of the alien in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial and The Lord of the Ringss Gollum's [...] "long-lost cousin".|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{the first}} two decades, along with {{thousands}} of immigrants from the surrounding area, Hull House attracted many female residents who later became prominent and influential reformers at various levels. At the beginning, Addams and Starr volunteered as on-call doctors when the real doctors either didn't show up or weren't available. They acted as midwives, saved babies from neglect, prepared the dead for burial, nursed the sick, and sheltered domestic violence victims. For example, one Italian bride had lost her wedding ring and in turn was beaten by her husband for a week. She sought shelter at the settlement and it was granted to her. Also, a baby born with a cleft palate was unwanted by his mother so he was kept at the Hull House for six weeks after an operation. In another case, a woman {{was about to give}} birth to an illegitimate baby, so none of the Irish matrons would touch it. Addams and Starr stepped in and delivered this helpless little one. Finally, a female Italian immigrant was so thrilled about fresh roses at one of the Hull House receptions that she insisted they had come from Italy. She <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> as beautiful in America {{despite the fact that she}} lived within ten blocks of a florist shop. Her limited view of America came from the untidy street she lived on and the long struggle to adapt to American ways. The settlement was also gradually drawn into advocating for legislative reforms at the municipal, state and federal levels, addressing issues such as child labor, women's suffrage, healthcare reform and immigration policy. Some claim that the work of the Hull House marked the beginning of what we know today as [...] "Social Welfare".|$|E

2500|$|In 1970, Eggleston's friend William Christenberry {{introduced}} him to Walter Hopps, director of Washington, D.C.'s Corcoran Gallery. Hopps later reported being [...] "stunned" [...] by Eggleston's work: [...] "I <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> like it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Prior {{to writing}} the script to Alien, O'Bannon {{had been working}} in France for Chilean cult {{director}} Alejandro Jodorowsky's planned adaptation of Frank Herbert's classic science-fiction novel Dune. Also hired for the project was Swiss surrealist artist H. R. Giger. Giger showed O'Bannon his nightmarish, monochromatic artwork, which left O'Bannon deeply disturbed. [...] "I <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>anything</b> that was quite as horrible {{and at the same}} time as beautiful as his work" [...] he remembered later. The Dune film collapsed, but O'Bannon would remember Giger when Alien was greenlit, and suggested to director Ridley Scott that he be brought on to design the Alien, saying that if he were to design a monster, it would be truly original.|$|E
