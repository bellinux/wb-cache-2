This is different from check-ing a program with a compiler, which always points the programmer to the most likely causes of the errors it detects.

We present a framework for the management of <b>fault</b> <b>locators</b> whose error diagnoses are based on data about a program and its test cases, especially as collected during test runs, and demonstrate that it is capable of performing reasonably well using a couple of simple <b>fault</b> <b>locators</b> in different evaluation scenarios...|$|R

40|$|The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) has {{successfully}} operated an in-house developed powerline <b>fault</b> <b>locator</b> system since 1986. The BPA <b>fault</b> <b>locator</b> system consists of remotes installed at cardinal {{power transmission line}} system nodes and a central master which polls the remotes for traveling wave time-of-arrival data. A power line fault produces a fast rise-time traveling wave which emanates from the fault point and propagates throughout the power grid. The remotes time-tag the traveling wave leading edge as it passes through the power system cardinal substation nodes. A synchronizing pulse transmitted via the BPA analog microwave system on a wideband channel sychronizes the time-tagging counters in the remote units to a different accuracy of better than one microsecond. The remote units correct the raw time tags for synchronizing pulse propagation delay and return these corrected values to the <b>fault</b> <b>locator</b> master.

40|$|Electrical energy {{transmission}} technologies are evolving {{as the need}} for sustainable energy resources continues to increase. HVDC transmission systems are becoming more prominent in power system design and operation, due to their superior performance in transmitting large amounts of power over long distances, which is needed in applications such as offshore wind farm developments. Research activities for HVDC systems are being pursuit to further improve their operation, reliability, quality, and costs. One particular aspect of improving HVDC systems is the efficient and economic maintenance of the system during post-disturbance conditions, which makes the problem of identifying the exact fault location on the line a critical issue. Fault location can be determined by using <b>fault</b> <b>locators,</b> which rely on sending a signal and using the reflected wave of that signal to determine the exact fault location. However, <b>fault</b> <b>locators</b> may cause further damage to the line and lack the ability to locate temporary faults. Locating temporary faults could be useful in determining weak points of the system, in order to do preventative maintenance, which improves the reliability of the system. Therefore, the technique of locating faults using fault transient data has emerged. Also, <b>fault</b> <b>locators</b> lack the ability to locate faults in a hybrid DC line system, where the transmission medium consists of segments of both underground cables and overhead lines, when using only terminal measurements. Therefore, solving the fault location problem utilizing transient data recorded at the terminals in systems of two and three different transmission medium segments is investigated in this thesis for an HVDC system with voltage source converters (VSC), as a means to demonstrate improved post-disturbance efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Travelling Waves (TWs) are {{electro-magnetic}} transients {{that are}} generated {{when there is}} a sudden change of voltage in the network, such as when a <b>fault</b> occurs. <b>Fault</b> <b>locators</b> based on TWs have recently emerged as an alternative to typical impedance <b>fault</b> <b>locators</b> thanks to their higher precision in most cases. The development of new algorithms based on TWs is improved by the understanding of their behaviors, in particular with the analysis of high frequency records of faults. Such records are not readily available. We performed a measurement campaign in the Belgian transmission network to acquire records of TWs generated when faults occur. This paper reports the experience acquired during the campaign, and discusses fault location algorithm improvements to account for the unique topology of the monitored line. The algorithm improvement reduces the error caused for non-homogeneous lines, which can be significant for big lines. The records analysis showed three important factors that influence the shape of the recorded TWs: the discontinuity in the line caused by a T-junction, the bandwidth of the measurement transformers, and the secondary cables connected to the current transformers. Therefore, those effects should be carefully considered when developing new algorithms based on TWs. info:eu-repo/semantics/inPres...|$|R

40|$|The general aim of {{this thesis}} is to develop an {{accurate}} fault location scheme that can solve the practical problems affecting {{the accuracy of the}} existing conventional <b>fault</b> <b>locators.</b> Firstly, a thorough investigation of the performance of the well known fault location methods was performed aiming to visualize the basic characteristics of the fault location estimation procedure. As can be seen from this study, the mutual coupling among the adjacent conductors is a serious problem. Thus, it represents a serious problem affecting the accuracy of all protection equipment. Also, the effects of high impedance faults on the accuracy of all <b>fault</b> <b>locators</b> with both single and double terminal methods were emphasized. Both problems represent the basic challenges that can remarkably affect the performance of all existing <b>fault</b> <b>locators.</b> In order to eliminate the effects of both mutual coupling and fault resistance existence, a new fault location algorithm was introduced employing the modal transformation in conjunction with the apparent impedance approach. The main point of modal transformation is to transform a group of coupled equations into decoupled ones resulting in diagonalized equation matrices. In the third part, AI-based tuning was established to adapt the overall performance of the modal transformation-based algorithm to compensate the total errors that can not be eliminated conventionally. In order to realize the optimal AI tool, both ANN and FL systems were examined to perform the required mapping. With its powerful toolbox for ANN and FL systems, MATLAB was selected as the platform for developing all tuning tools. As revealed from the tests of all developed tuners, FL and ANN are considered as powerful tools for nonlinear mapping and function approximation. However, FL-based tuner has a faster training speed as well as a better accuracy from the protection viewpoint. Finally, the overall FL-based fault location tuner was introduced, which provides a complete coverage of all fault cases even those cases with high resistance values up to 1000 Ohm. The overall scheme, comprising from the modal transformation-based algorithm in conjunction with the FL-based universal tuner, was subjected to a variety of advanced test cases to evaluate its performance. These test cases included the existence of the non-linear arcs, multiple-loading (infeed) intermediate busses between the sending and the receiving ends, different ground means and partially coupled lines.
