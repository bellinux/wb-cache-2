25|$|Marc Jeannerod {{proposed}} {{that the process of}} self-recognition operates covertly and effortlessly. <b>It</b> <b>depends</b> <b>upon</b> a set of mechanisms involving the processing of specific neural signals, from sensory as well as from central origin. Researchers have used experimental situations, in both healthy participants and schizophrenic patients, where these signals can be dissociated from each other and where self-recognition becomes ambiguous. These situations reveal that there are two levels of self-recognition, an automatic level for action identification, and a conscious level for the sense of agency, which both rely on the same principle of congruence of the action-related signals.|$|E
25|$|While {{the methods}} behind {{collecting}} bite mark {{evidence at the}} scene are leading toward greater standardization, the methodology behind analyzing bite marks is extremely variable because <b>it</b> <b>depends</b> <b>upon</b> the preference of the specific odontologist. As discussed earlier, there are several methods used to compare bite marks ranging from life sized photographs to computer enhanced 3-dimensional imaging. These methods vary in precision and accuracy, {{and there is no}} set standard by which to compare or analyze them. The lack of analytical standards leads to a wide array of interpretation with any bite mark evidence. Some odontologists even disagree on whether or not a mark on the body {{is the result of a}} bite. Therefore, the interpretation of evidence lies largely on the expertise of the forensic odontologist handling the case.|$|E

2500|$|In exposed systems, wind {{can create}} turbulent, spiral-formed surface {{currents}} called Langmuir circulations (Fig. 3). [...] Exactly how these currents become established {{is still not}} well understood, but {{it is evident that}} it involves some interaction between horizontal surface currents and surface gravity waves. [...] The visible result of these rotations, which can be seen in any lake, are the surface foamlines that run parallel to the wind direction. [...] Positively buoyant particles and small organisms concentrate in the foamline at the surface and negatively buoyant objects are found in the upwelling current between the two rotations. [...] Objects with neutral buoyancy tend to be evenly distributed in the water column. This turbulence circulates nutrients in the water column, making it crucial for many pelagic species, however its effect on benthic and profundal organisms is minimal to non-existent, respectively. The degree of nutrient circulation is system specific, as <b>it</b> <b>depends</b> <b>upon</b> such factors as wind strength and duration, as well as lake or pool depth and productivity.|$|E
2500|$|When printed ch, gh, sh, th are {{pronounced}} as two sounds, as in Shanghai, hogshead, and outhouse, {{then they}} are written as two braille letters rather than with the ligatures [...] Generally, other ligatures {{should not be used}} if they might cause problems with legibility, as with the ing in lingerie, though they tend to be with familiar words, such as ginger and finger, even if their pronunciation is divided between syllables. None of the ligatures are to be used across the boundaries of compound words. For example, [...] is not used in twofold, nor [...] in dumbbell. The rules state that they should not span a prefix and stem either, so for example the ed in deduce, the er of rerun and derail, and the ble of sublet should be written out in full. In practice this is variable, as <b>it</b> <b>depends</b> <b>upon</b> the awareness of the writer. The of in professor, for example, might not be recognized spanning prefix and stem, and no-one has a problem with a-cc-ept or a-dd-r-e-s-s, despite the technical violation. There is also conflict with the overriding tendency to contract sequences that fall within a single syllable. So the same writer who divides the er in derive may allow the ligature in derivation. A similar pattern emerges from suffixes: [...] is not used in freedom, since it spans stem and suffix, but is used in freed, because it forms a single syllable with the stem. What is considered to constitute a prefix or suffix is somewhat arbitrary: [...] is not used in Charlestown, for example, but it is in Charleston. Ligatures may also not separate digraphs or diphthongs in print. For example, aerial does not use , Oedipus does not use , and tableau does not use [...] Also, it is normal to use the letter [...] for the broken vowel in i-d-ea-s or c-r-ea-t-e, despite it being pronounced as two sounds rather than one as in head or ocean.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{scholastic}} tradition of Saint Thomas Aquinas, {{a number of}} whose doctrines have been incorporated into Roman Catholic dogma, the soul is the substantial form of a human being. Aquinas held the Quaestiones disputate de anima, or [...] "Disputed questions on the soul", at the Roman studium provinciale of the Dominican Order at Santa Sabina, the forerunner of the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum during the academic year 1265-66. [...] By 1268 Aquinas had written {{at least the first}} book of the Sententia Libri De anima, Aquinas' commentary on Aristotle's De anima, the translation of which from the Greek was completed by Aquinas' Dominican associate at Viterbo William of Moerbeke in 1267. [...] Like Aristotle, Aquinas held that the human being was a unified composite substance of two substantial principles: form and matter. The soul is the substantial form and so the first actuality of a material organic body with the potentiality for life. While Aquinas defended the unity of human nature as a composite substance constituted by these two inextricable principles of form and matter, he also argued for the incorruptibility of the intellectual soul, in contrast to the corruptibility of the vegetative and sensitive animation of plants and animals. His argument for the subsistence and incorruptibility of the intellectual soul takes its point of departure from the metaphysical principle that operation follows upon being (agiture sequitur esse), i.e., the activity of a thing reveals the mode of being and existence <b>it</b> <b>depends</b> <b>upon.</b> Since the intellectual soul exercises its own per se intellectual operations without employing material faculties, i.e. intellectual operations are immaterial, the intellect itself and the intellectual soul, must likewise be immaterial and so incorruptible. [...] Even though the intellectual soul of man is able to subsist upon the death of the human being, Aquinas does not hold that the human person is able to remain integrated at death. [...] The separated intellectual soul is neither a man nor a human person. The intellectual soul by itself is not a human person (i.e., an individual supposit of a rational nature). Hence, Aquinas held that [...] "soul of St. Peter pray for us" [...] would be more appropriate than [...] "St. Peter pray for us", because all things connected with his person, including memories, ended with his corporeal life.|$|E
