5|$|Bell {{was then}} an {{employee}} of the Ritz-Carlton in Philadelphia. At one point, he tried his hand as a stock broker and lost $50,000 (presently, $) during the Wall Street Crash of 1929. His father bailed <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> deprivation, and he returned to working at the Ritz. From 1930 until 1932, he was a backfield coach for the Temple Owls football team. In 1932, Marshall tried to coax Bell into buying the rights to a NFL franchise, but Bell disparaged the league and ridiculed the idea. When Pop Warner was hired to coach Temple for the 1933 season, Warner chose to hire his own assistants and Bell was let go.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of the first 20 years of Ecgberht's reign, but {{it is thought that}} he was able to {{maintain}} the independence of Wessex against the kingdom of Mercia, which at that time dominated the other southern English kingdoms. In 825 Ecgberht defeated Beornwulf of Mercia, ended Mercia's supremacy at the Battle of Ellandun, and proceeded to take control of the Mercian dependencies in southeastern England. In 829 he defeated Wiglaf of Mercia and drove <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> kingdom, temporarily ruling Mercia directly. Later that year Ecgberht received the submission of the Northumbrian king at Dore. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle subsequently described Ecgberht as a bretwalda or 'wide-ruler' of Anglo-Saxon lands.|$|E

5|$|On September 3, 2009, The Washington Post {{called on}} Rangel to resign his {{chairmanship}} of the House Ways and Means Committee, given the ethical issues that had surfaced. Another Republican resolution was put forth to force <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> chairmanship. However, Rangel stayed in place and mostly maintained his role in House leadership and policy discussions, including the Obama health care reform plan (opposition to which, he suggested, was partly due to racial prejudice against President Obama). Nevertheless, his influence was diminished by the questions surrounding him.|$|E
5|$|Sawyer is in prison, {{trying to}} befriend Munson (Ian Gomez), {{a man who}} has hidden ten million dollars. He warns Munson that the warden (Bill Duke) is trying to con <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> money. Eventually, Munson, worried that his wife will find where he has hidden the money, enlists Sawyer's help in moving the stash. Sawyer then reveals this {{information}} to the warden in exchange for a reduced sentence and a part of the money, which he puts in a bank account for Clementine Phillips, a baby that previous con victim Cassidy Phillips (Kim Dickens) has told him is his daughter. The warden sarcastically congratulates Sawyer on lying and cheating his way out of prison.|$|E

The pair rescue Elsa, with Kelso killing Hogeboom to put <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mental anguish. With the water level rising, the group use an open manhole to escape, but Phelps is swept away in the current. Whilst the SRF scam is exposed, several members escape justice by making {{a deal with the}} Assistant D.A. to testify. They attend Phelps's funeral, each delivering eulogies to his memory, much to the disgust of Elsa. Biggs remarks to Kelso that Phelps was never his friend, to which Kelso agrees but responds that he was never Phelps' enemy.|$|E

5|$|Dr. Taub, {{using his}} {{experience}} as a plastic surgeon, gains Kenny's and his father's trust and frequently clashes with House on the diagnosis. House believes Kenny is suffering juvenile rheumatoid arthritis while Taub believes it is merely the side effects of increased intracranial pressure. By persuading Kenny's father not to follow House's treatment and by attempting to kick him off the case, House fires Taub, only to have his decision reversed by Cuddy. Ultimately both House and Taub are proven wrong when Thirteen realizes Kenny is suffering Lyme disease, with the telltale rash hidden by his hair. Incensed by Taub's actions, House begins to dig into his life, and gets him to confess that he resigned his old position as a plastic surgeon because he was discovered having a secret affair with his nurse. He signed a non-compete agreement with his former partners in exchange for their keeping quiet about the affair, effectively blackballing <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> area of expertise.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile in Scranton, {{the office}} is left without a {{receptionist}}. Not wanting to get roped into being receptionist again, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) defies Andy Bernard's (Ed Helms) orders to answer the phone. With {{the rest of the}} staff similarly declining to answer the phone, Andy is left with no choice but to take on the receptionist's role himself, and performs the job with unexpected gusto. He orders new magazines for the waiting area, cooks mini-pizzas as reception snacks, color-coordinates the desk, and brings in a mail cart to deliver mail. Pam and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) attempt to talk <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> newfound enjoyment, believing it to be linked to his lingering feelings for Erin, to no success.|$|E
5|$|Revenue from tariffs {{was then}} {{a major source of}} income for the federal government. There was no federal income tax, and tariff debates were passionate; the 1888 presidential {{election}} had them as a major issue. Many Democrats supported a tariff for revenue only—that is, the purpose of tariffs should be to finance government, not to encourage American manufacturers. McKinley disagreed with that and sponsored the McKinley Tariff of 1890. This act, passed by the Republican-dominated Congress, raised rates on imports to protect American industry. McKinley's tariff proved unpopular among many people who had to pay the increased prices, and was seen as a reason not only for his defeat for re-election to Congress in 1890, but also for the Republicans losing control of both House and Senate in that year's midterm elections. Nevertheless, McKinley's defeat did not, in the end, damage his political prospects, as the Democrats were blamed for gerrymandering <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> seat.|$|E

5|$|They meet up {{with the}} rest of the family at a car museum. They steal a replica of the main villain's car from The Road Warrior and engage in a ludicrous car chase through the streets of Hollywood, with the film {{executives}} on their trail. Homer, taking an idea he believes to be from Braveheart, moons the executives along with Gibson so that they will stop their car out of disgust. Homer and Gibson then attend the film's premiere back in Springfield, but when the film ends, the entire audience walks out disgusted, and Jimmy Stewart's granddaughter walks up to them, slaps them, and threatens to sue them for the bad film. Homer then tries to apologize to Gibson, but he does not blame him, arriving to the conclusion there is no place for violence-lovers like them in Hollywood; however, as soon as Homer suggests more stupid film ideas, Gibson kicks <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> limousine.|$|E
5|$|Yuu's {{younger sister}} Ayumi {{eventually}} awakens {{an ability to}} cause anything around her to suddenly collapse, which results in her death. Yuu falls into a deep depression as a result and isolates himself, but Nao successfully manages to pull <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> depression and gets {{him to return to}} the student council. While attending a concert of the post-rock band Zhiend with Nao, Yuu recollects previously suppressed memories of his brother Shunsuke, who has the ability to time travel. Shunsuke had used this ability to establish Hoshinoumi Academy and an affiliated organization attempting to develop a vaccine to prevent children from developing abilities before they manifest, but repeated use leaves him blind. Yuu learns that the true nature of his ability enables him to steal someone's ability by possessing them. Yuu steals Shunsuke's ability to go back in time and ultimately prevent Ayumi's death by stealing her collapse ability before she can use it.|$|E
5|$|Angola {{held the}} first round of its 1992 presidential {{election}} on 29–30 September. Dos Santos officially received 49.57% of the vote and Savimbi won 40.6%. As no candidate received 50% or more of the vote, election law dictated a second round of voting between the top two contenders. Savimbi, along with eight opposition parties and many other election observers, said the election had been neither free nor fair. An official observer wrote that there was little UN supervision, that 500,000 UNITA voters were disenfranchised and that there were 100 clandestine polling stations. Savimbi sent Jeremias Chitunda, Vice President of UNITA, to Luanda to negotiate the terms of the second round. The election process broke down on 31 October, when government troops in Luanda attacked UNITA. Civilians, using guns they had received from police a few days earlier, conducted house-by-house raids with the Rapid Intervention Police, killing and detaining hundreds of UNITA supporters. The government took civilians in trucks to the Camama cemetery and Morro da Luz ravine, shot them, and buried them in mass graves. Assailants attacked Chitunda's convoy on 2 November, pulling <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> car and shooting him and two others in their faces. The MPLA massacred over ten thousand UNITA and FNLA voters nationwide in a few days in what was known as the Halloween Massacre. Savimbi said the election had neither been free nor fair and refused to participate in the second round. He then proceeded to resume armed struggle against the MPLA.|$|E
