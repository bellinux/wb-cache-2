40|$|Employers and {{job seekers}} rely {{extensively}} on job informational networks to fill vacancies or {{to find a}} job. The widespread use of job contacts to find work has been largely associated with labor outcomes, such as finding a job or even affecting wages. Some scholars have claimed that informal referrals play a determinant role in reducing informational mismatches between potential employers and job seekers. Although several {{studies have shown that}} the use of friends and relatives is correlated with labor outcomes, little is known about the causal effect. In this article, I aim to identify whether there is a causal effect of using informal referrals on two main outcomes: the probability of being employed and hourly wages. I use a large data set from Colombia, the Living Standard Survey 2003, to contrast the results from three main methodologies: standard OLS estimation, propensity-score matching, and instrumental variables. Results suggest that much of the positive effect of using informal referrals on employment reflects the prevalence of informal-sector <b>jobs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>filled</b> through this method rather than a causal effect. On the contrary, the results for hourly wages suggest a negative causal effect of using job informational networks, which is explained by the low-quality/poor matches theory.

40|$|Personnel {{recruitment}} processes run {{very differently}} and turn out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more ore less time-consuming and problematical. A planned hiring date can pass {{by with a}} job being unfilled. The consequence may be a delayed entrance; sometimes the search for appropriate staff is cancelled without a successful hiring. Therefore, unfilled jobs represent unmet labour demand and underachieved employment potential. In this paper we explore different types of unmet labour demand. We differentiate four process types of intended hiring processes. They are analysed {{on the basis of}} bivariate correlations with characteristics of the <b>jobs</b> going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>filled,</b> the searching firms and the hired persons. We use data of the annual Job Vacancy Survey of the IAB (Institute for Employment Research) for the German job market from 2000 to 2007. We can show, that about 55 to 60 % of the hiring cases run in due time. Insofar hiring processes are predominantly running without frictions. On the other hand 40 to 45 % of planned hiring dates pass by. Among these, in about 20 % of the cases firms are waiting for an already found candidate to fill the position. In about 20 to 25 % of the cases firms are still searching for staff. Particularly in the lastmentioned cases firms involve the public employment service. During the last years about 6 to 12 % of searching firms had to cancel the search without a successful hiring. Personnel recruitment problems - i. e. delayed entrances or cancelled personnel search - are often arising with higher qualification requirements. On the one hand this indicates perhaps higher skilled shortages; on the other hand this may indicate exaggerated requirements. In case of hiring delays firms often make wage concessions.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis presents the prototype for a {{decision support system}} which permits repeated formulation and solution of the Marine Corps staffing allocation problem under various user-controlled policy scenarios. The system allows the decision maker to vary the eligibility criteria used to determine who may be transferred {{as well as to}} adjust the relative priorities of two objectives: minimize relocation costs and maximize "fit" as defined by the Marine Corps. The user may also set a minimum acceptable "aspiration level" for the total fill of all billets. Based on the eligibility requirements which are input by the user, the system extracts data on individual Marines and the <b>jobs</b> that need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>filled,</b> and matches people to billets using a set of matching rules developed by the Marine Corps. The resulting matches are then transformed into a capacitated transshipment network for solution in a special commercial optimization software package. The network formulation models a multiobjective allocation problem using optimization techniques to permit adjustment of some of the objective priorities. After the solution <b>is</b> presented <b>to</b> the decision maker, he may change the relative priorities of the relocation cost and fit objectives, set an aspiration level for the total fill, or change the rules used to determine who may be transferred. The user then has the option of reformulating and re-solving the problem with the new objective priorities or aspirations, or re-starting the entire problem based on the new eligibility rules. Testing of the system on all Marine Corps aviation officers, who constitute about 35 percent of the total personnel, suggests that the concept <b>is</b> feasible <b>to</b> implement for the entire Marine Corps, provided that certain enhancements recommended in the thesis are implemented.

40|$|The {{technological}} age {{has led to}} tremendous advancements, and in the process, {{has presented}} several challenges. One of the most pervasive {{is the need for}} an educated, highly skilled workforce. Unfortunately, many of today's youth <b>are</b> failing <b>to</b> obtain the requisite education and skills to survive in the new global economy, a fact confirmed by alarming high school dropout rates. One demographic group, more than all the others, frequently tops the lists of statistics about the rates with which they <b>are</b> unable <b>to</b> successfully navigate and complete their secondary education, namely African-American males. For most people the words `HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUT' represent a life sentence to abject poverty, especially in the increasingly competitive global economy we live in. At a minimum, many would argue, a high school diploma is needed {{in order to have a}} reasonable opportunity to earn a living wage. The long-term effects of dropping out of school <b>are</b> devastating <b>to</b> individuals, communities and the national economy. In recent years much attention has <b>been</b> given <b>to</b> the crisis in the American educational system; from former President George Bush's `No Child Left Behind' initiative, to Oprah Winfrey's specials on the subject, to Bill and Melinda Gates funneling millions of dollars to organizations and schools, to TIME magazines' cover story entitled "Dropout Nation. " Unfortunately, despite all the attention, the streets, prisons and dead-end <b>jobs</b> continue <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>filled</b> with far too many hopeless, desperate, frustrated, and angry youth, who have not <b>been</b> able <b>to</b> fulfill their dreams of becoming successful, productive members in society, partially due to their inability to complete high school. This study seeks to direct the attention and energy of an often overlooked, yet potentially powerful group of popular culture icons, i. e. Hip-Hop artists, to the frequently discussed topic of educational reformation. Since Hip-Hop artists have generally become accepted as major opinion leaders, representing the eyes, ears, and feelings of global youth expression, this study seeks to determine what, if anything, Hip-Hop artists can contribute to the discussions about educational reform and strategies to reverse the disturbing trends among African-American males at all levels within America's educational system. The Hip-Hop artist participants corroborate many popular theories and ideas about educational reform including an emphasis on parental involvement and engagement, the pervasive cultural and community influence on underachieving students, the importance of positive male role models, and most importantly the preeminence of cultivating respectful, caring relationships between African American male students, teachers, and administration. Simultaneously, these artists problematize some of the prevailing stereotypes about African American male students such as they don't value getting an education, they don't care about school, or that their parents are not concerned about their education. In all this study provides a very unique look at the issue of educational reform from a modern and unique perspective...|$|R
40|$|Institutional {{pressures}} within liberal individualist societies deny former prisoners {{a legitimate}} {{status in the}} mainstream workforce. These pressures generate organisational legitimacy concerns for firms that may <b>be</b> willing <b>to</b> offer to this cohort decent jobs which ‘more deserving’ {{members of the community}} might seek. The right-minded, socially acceptable, and pragmatic course of action for firms that have decent <b>jobs</b> <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> shun former prisoners. Thus former convicts are funnelled into unemployment or into ‘lousy jobs’ with few prospects for advancement. This systemic discrimination is troubling. Former convicts have already been punished for their transgressions and good <b>jobs</b> have <b>been</b> shown <b>to</b> support their reintegration into the community, which is ultimately in the interests of society. Drawing on neoinstitutional theory, this thesis identifies the pressures that induce firms to exclude former prisoners from decent work opportunities in a liberal individualist society, and examines how a special class of ‘reintegrative’ firms manage to resist these pressures. These empirical contributions are shaped by a theoretical approach that takes up recent calls to reunify neoinstitutional theory with its phenomenological foundations. In so doing, the study responds to criticisms that neoinstitutional theory has failed to show how wider societal beliefs and values ‘rationalise’ certain forms of conduct and how these societal-level forces come <b>to</b> <b>be</b> embodied in everyday organisational practices and workplace interactions. The research project is carried out via a study of four firms that provide reintegrative employment opportunities to former prisoners in the State of Victoria, in Australia. The analysis is conducted at two levels. ‘Up stream’, at the societal level, the cosmology of liberal individualism is analysed. The belief system and styles of thinking engendered by this philosophy are examined and then linked to ‘down stream’, local, shared attitudes and workplace behaviours at the ‘coalface’ of workforce reintegration. The ultimate claim of the dissertation is that liberal individualism is a philosophy that is largely incompatible with workforce reintegration. In providing good <b>jobs</b> <b>to</b> former prisoners, reintegrative firms must ‘break the rules’ of this form of liberalism. In the process, these firms violate some of the most sacred ideals of liberalism and expose as fantasies some of its most cherished claims. Workforce reintegration can therefore be a disquieting organisational practice. Skilful ‘remedial work’ is crucial if reintegrative firms <b>are</b> <b>to</b> smooth over these violations and sustain their reintegrative hiring practices. To pursue their idea of what is right and good, reintegrative firms must defy the institutional context in which they are embedded. While workforce reintegration remains an institutionally-contained practice, it will likely be tolerated by the broader community. Recently, however, state officials and policy makers within some liberal individualist societies have signalled their intention to get serious about prisoner reintegration. Should they indeed do so, they too may do well to master the arts of remedial work. For they may find there <b>is</b> a reckoning <b>to</b> <b>be</b> had with the polity, given workforce reintegration involves profaning sacred liberal ideals...|$|R

Each institution has set system of motivation differently. Workers who are motivated work better, they submit better performance and they can be pattern for other colleagues. A number of organizations use employees evaluation to right adjustment of system of motivation and remuneration. If the system is set correctly, it is probably reflected in the overall results of the organization. It means that the system would be based on the needs of employees. But it is not always possible to based on this model, that why <b>is</b> important <b>to</b> find compromise that will satisfy management and employees.

On this basis were selected two institutions in České Budějovice. Namely Diocesan charity in České Budějovice and Citizens advice berau that were compared. It was choosen qualitative research, method of questioning and technique of dialogue. Resarch group was constituted by personalits and employees of organization who are in charge of personal administration. The dialogues were divided into few sectors. The first part of dialogues <b>was</b> concentrated <b>to</b> information about organization. The second part of dialogues <b>was</b> oriented <b>to</b> employment of employees. There was investigated kind of employment, working hours, employees benefits, culture of working environment and rules of work. The third part of dialogues <b>was</b> concentrated <b>to</b> sphere of employees evaluation. There were investigated if the system of evalutaion exists and how does it work. I was interested in how often is remunertion in motion and if employees are known with the system of remuneration. The fourth part of dialogues was focused on motivation of employees. There was investigated which kind of motivation is used in the organization. It means if the organization is focused on providing financial or nonfinancial motivation. Or if employees can choose the kind if motivation themselves. The last part of dialogues was oriented on sphere of remuneration. It was investigated which components constitute wage and how often are remunerations provided and in which form. How organization management evaluates prestige of position against organization and satisfacton of employees. There is devote considerable space in this selected organizations, it follows from results of research. None of the organizations do not use process of motivation that is based on the needs of employees. Both organizations use possibility employees evalutaion. Due to this evaluation, organizations gets informations how employees work, how they manage their duties and what they miss. Each organization uses results evalutaion differently. Organizations motivate their workers through financial and nonfinancial motives. The most often is used word statement. It is evident that the man has <b>to</b> <b>be</b> motivated by the job itself for the position of social worker. The <b>job</b> has <b>to</b> enjoy, <b>be</b> <b>filling</b> and motivate.

The system of motivation and remuneration of employees imagines lots of difficulties, but the most important <b>is</b> it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> functional and beneficial.
