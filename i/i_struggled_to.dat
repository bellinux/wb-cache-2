The {{reason for this}} is that in my own life, in my own development, for a long period <b>I</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> avoid being [...] "Japanese", to avoid [...] "Japanese" [...] qualities. It was largely through my contact with John Cage that I came to recognize the value of my own tradition.|$|E
500|$|In late 2011, Yusef {{manages to}} win his former wife back. They later make plans to get married. Nina Wadia {{explains}} why Zainab is willing to forgive Yusef. Wadia said to Inside Soap: [...] "He tells Zainab that {{he was forced to}} start the fire by his family. Yusef goes on to explain that he knew it was wrong the minute he lit the match, and that he ran into the house to save her. And {{by the end of this}} conversation, she finds herself saying to him, 'Let's get married' - regardless! Obviously, it was something <b>I</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> get my head around. But being burnt in that fire is what they both have in common - and that experience connects them so deeply. She recognises that he made a mistake but also decides that the whole thing was probably her fault, because she walked out on their marriage." [...] Wadia continued: [...] "It doesn't look like Zainab's going to listen. But as Denise leaves, it's clear she's torn about what to do." [...] A short time before their wedding day arrives, Yusef starts to abuse Zainab both physically and mentally. He forbids Zainab to leave the house and later starts using her son, Kamil, to control her. Wadia explains that she wants the storyline to have a positive impact against real-life violence. She told BBC News :"I think the idea behind showing a strong woman like Zainab changing like this is to show that it can happen to even the strongest of women. They can change and they can be manipulated - especially if they're isolated from their friends and family. The manipulator can take advantage, so it's to prove that it can even happen to people like her. To be honest, if even one woman rings that Action Line at the end of the show and there's some difference made to her life, I'll feel like we've done our job," [...] she continued. [...] "It is a serious issue and I'm glad it's being highlighted. I hope that it wakes anyone up - not just women, I know that there are abused men out there as well. So if it gives anyone the strength to leave a relationship like that, we'll have done our job." [...] The scenes where Yusef refused to let Zainab see Kamil pulled in 8.69m viewers at 7.30pm. BBC Three's repeat of the episode later secured 994k viewers at 10pm.|$|E
2500|$|Famously, McGuinness {{was turned}} down several times by the Donegal County Board, on one {{occasion}} being thwarted {{by the lack of}} a plug socket for the projector needed for his PowerPoint display. [...] "I was the only candidate [...] and <b>I</b> <b>struggled</b> <b>to</b> get it", he said the week before Donegal took on Mayo in the 2012 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final. He had offers from other counties but held out, determined to become senior boss even when those at the top did their utmost to deprive him of the opportunity.|$|E

5000|$|Metal Hammer {{reviewed}} the album in the February 2011 issue. It received a low score of 5/10 and was criticised for sounding unoriginal and much too like the band As I Lay Dying.

2500|$|The album's {{message was}} one decrying globalization, yet some critics were {{disappointed}} with the results. Joe McLaughlin notes: [...] "when Pelican claim the record focuses on the 'homogenous effects of globalization', I think I am excused in wanting a touch more than an intricate guitar riff and a thumping bass line to ponder over [...] <b>I</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>to</b> gain a tangible meaning solely from crashing cymbals underpinning distorted guitars." ...|$|R

50|$|I am part libertine, part priest. I have dual yearnings. On the {{one hand}} I like {{solitude}} and introspection. I am a sky-gazer whose goals are universal. I crave the freedom of simplicity.

These two impulses have often been at odds with each other. <b>I</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>to</b> find a balance.|$|R

5000|$|His recent {{compositions}} {{have been}} compared to Erik Satie, Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel, Keith Jarrett, and Morton Feldman blending elements of minimalism, impressionism, gamelan, world music, and melodic classicism. His piano works {{have been described as}} [...] "evoking Debussy but refracted through a 21st century prism". Reviewer Brian Olewnick summarizes, [...] "Waller's music has centered around a kind of melodic classicism, the source of which <b>I</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>to</b> ascertain." [...] Critic Harry Rolnick in reviewing a performance of his String Trio Per La Madre e La Nonna (2012), [...] "The harmonies were like something written by Dvorák (perhaps his Cypresses), but they were obvious original." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, we have not," [...] said <b>I,</b> <b>struggling</b> <b>to</b> {{overcome}} the disappointment which I found creeping over me. The {{source of this}} disappointment was the thin and faded appearance of the coloring, which at first suggested to me {{the idea of a}} water-colored sketch. It had evidently suffered barbarously in the process of cleaning, a fact of which I had been forewarned. This circumstance has a particularly unfavorable effect on a picture of Raphael's, because his coloring, at best, is delicate and reserved, and, as compared with, that of Rubens, approaches to poverty; so that he can ill afford to lose any thing in this way.|$|R
60|$|The {{time has}} come for you to leave this house. Seventeen days ago you foisted {{yourself}} upon me, and since then we have been together night and day.

Then, like the ungenerous foe that you are, you struck me while I was down. However, your designs have failed. <b>I</b> <b>struggle</b> <b>to</b> my feet and order you to withdraw. Nay, withdraw is too polite a word. Your cab is at the door; get out. But, stop, a word with you before you go.|$|R
