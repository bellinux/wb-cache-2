50|$|An <b>equipment</b> <b>practice</b> {{was needed}} quickly, {{and it was}} {{realised}} that a matrix of reed relays would be {{about the same size}} as a crossbar switch. Therefore, the <b>equipment</b> <b>practice</b> of AT&E's crossbar system was adopted for the TXE1 apart from the STC common control, which had its own <b>equipment</b> <b>practice.</b> The STC common control consisted of 14 racks and made up a complete suite of the exchange. It was made entirely from discrete components as integrated circuits were not yet in common use. There was much discussion by all contractors as to whether at the time there was a reliable connector so as to provide the ability to withdraw and replace units. STC decided to have the units that could be withdrawn and AT&E and AEI did not. It turned out that the connectors used by STC were reliable and they had a great advantage in fault finding. It also allowed the STC engineers to place a suspect faulty unit in an outrigger so it could be tested in situ.|$|E

40|$|Equipment leak {{standards}} {{are designed to}} control emissions of VOCs and VHAPs from regulated equipment {{through the application of}} work <b>practices</b> and <b>equipment</b> <b>practices.</b> The work practice most commonly applied to control equipment leaks is the LDAR program, which is discussed in detail in Section 2. 2. 4. 2. Subsequent chapters address the monitoring, recordkeeping. and reporting requirements of implementing a LDAR program under NSPS or NESHAP standards. In this chapter, regulated equipment is reviewed to illustrate how monitoring programs are applied to specific pieces of equipment action, and special canned-motor and diaphragm pumps (US. �PA, 1990). Chemicals transferred by pumps can leak at the point of contact between the moving shaft and stationary casing. To isolate the pump's interior from the atmosphere. all pumps, except the seal-less type (canned-motor and diaphragm), require a seal {{at the point where the}} shaft penetrates the housing. The most commonly used seals in these pumps are packed and mechanical (US. EPA. 1980 a). <b>Equipment</b> <b>practices</b> include the use of specific types of components, equipment design standards or specifications, and operational standards for certain types of <b>equipment.</b> <b>Equipment</b> <b>practices</b> are evaluated using performance standards that provide a basis for monitoring or substantiating the effectiveness of such control <b>practices.</b> <b>Equipment</b> <b>practices,</b> briefty summarized in Section 2. 2. 4. 3, are addressed in greater detail in this chapter. A general set of equipment is covered by all of the equipment leak standards. Some equipment is covered only by specific standards. For example, product accumulator vessels are covered only by the equipment leak standards for benzene. Also, the vinyl chloride fugitive emission standards cover additional sources (loading and unloading lines, agitators, slip gauges, opening of equipment. and inprocess wastewater). Except for agitaton, however, the emissions from these sources generally are not considered "equipment leaks. " The equipment leak standards also identify requirements for closed-vent systems and control devices that may be used to comply with the regulations...|$|R

40|$|Several antineoplasic {{drugs have}} been {{demonstrated}} to be carcinogenic or to have mutagenic and teratogenic effects. The greatest protection is achieved {{with the implementation of}} administrative and engineering controls and safety procedures. Objective: to evaluate the improvements on pharmacy technicians' work practices, after the implementation of operational procedures related to individual protection, biologic safety cabinet disinfection and cytotoxic drug preparation. Method: case-study in a hospital pharmacy undergoing a certification process. Six pharmacy technicians were observed during their daily activities. Characterization of the work practices was made using a checklist based on ISOPP and PIC guidelines. The variables studied concerning cleaning/disinfection procedures, personal protective equipment and procedures for preparing cytotoxic drugs. The same work practices were evaluated after four months of operational procedures implementation. Concordance between work practices and guidelines was considered to be a quality indicator (guidelines concordance practices number/total number of practices x 100). Results: improvements were observed after operational procedures implementation. An improvement of 6, 25 % in personal protective <b>equipment</b> <b>practice</b> was achieved by changing second pair of gloves every thirty minutes. The major progress, 10 %, was obtained in disinfection procedure, where 80 % of tasks are now realized according to guidelines. By now, we hot an improvement of only 1 % at drug preparation procedure by placing one cytotoxic drug at a time inside the biological safety cabinet. Then, 85 % of practices are according to guidelines. Conclusion: before operational procedures implementation 80, 3 % of practices were according to the guidelines, while now is 84, 4 %. This indicates that is necessary to review the procedures frequently in the benefit to reduce the risks associated with handling cytotoxic drugs and maintenance of drug specifications...|$|E
