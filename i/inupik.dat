5000|$|At the 2000 census, {{there were}} 7,208 people, 1,780 {{households}} and 1,404 families {{residing in the}} borough. The population density was 0.18 per square mile (0/km²). There were 2,540 housing units at an average density of 0 per square mile (0/km²). The racial makeup of the borough was 12.32% White, 0.21% Black or African American, 82.46% Native American, 0.89% Asian, 0.06% Pacific Islander, 0.36% from other races, and 3.70% from two or more races. 0.79% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race. 40.00% reported speaking <b>Inupik</b> or [...] "Eskimo" [...] at home http://www.mla.org/map_data_results&state_id=2&county_id=188&mode=geographic&zip=&place_id=&cty_id=&ll=&a=&ea=&order=r.|$|E
40|$|Dermatoglyphic traits {{have been}} used to assess {{population}} affinities and structure. Here, we describe the digital patterns of four Eskimo populations from Alaska: two Yupik-speaking villages from St. Lawrence Island and two <b>Inupik</b> groups presently residing on mainland Alaska. For a broader evolutionary perspective, these four Eskimo populations are compared to other Inuit groups, to North American Indian populations, and to Siberian aggregates. The genetic structures of 18 New and Old World populations were explored using R -matrix plots and Wright’s FST values. The relationships between dermatoglyphic, blood genetic, geographic, and linguistic distances were assessed by comparing matrices through Mantel correlations and through partial and multiple correlations. Statistically significant relationships between dermatoglyphics and genetics, genetics and geography, and geography and language were revealed. In addition, significant correlations between dermatoglyphics and geography, with linguistic variation constant, were noted for females but not for males. These results attest to the usefulness of dermatoglyphics in resolving various evolutionary questions concerning normal human variation...|$|E
