40|$|Sediment plume {{predictions}} {{are part}} of the assessment of environmental impacts of dredging. The main source of turbidity while employing Trailer Suction <b>Hopper</b> <b>Dredgers</b> is the release of excess water through the overflow shaft. The near-field plume dynamics below and directly behind the sailing <b>hopper</b> <b>dredgers</b> are traditionally unknown during predictions of far-field plume dispersion. Indeed, an accurate input of the vertical and horizontal distributions of sediment at the source location is important to obtain reliable results at environmentally sensitive areas further away. In this paper, a computational fluid dynamics model is presented as a tool to determine the three-dimensional flows of water, sediment and air bubbles directly after release from the overflow shaft. The full dredger hull geometry and an actuator disc accounting for propeller action are included. It is shown that the model can reproduce two different cases of overflow plumes measured in the field with fair accuracy. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Turbidity plumes are an {{important}} topic in the environmental aspects of dredging. The main source of turbidity while employing Trailer Suction <b>Hopper</b> <b>Dredgers</b> is the release of excess water through the overflow shaft. In order to minimise environmental impacts of turbidity in early stages of planning as well as during project execution, turbidity prediction tools are necessary. To this end, numerical modelling tools are the most effective in the prediction of the sea currents and sediment dispersion. The near field plume dynamics below and directly behind the sailing <b>hopper</b> <b>dredgers</b> {{has always been the}} weakest link in these predictions, since accurate input of the vertical and horizontal distributions of sediment at the source location are paramount to obtain reliable results at the environmentally sensitive areas further away. In this paper, a Computational Fluid Dynamics model is presented as a tool to determine the three-dimensional flows of water, sediment and air bubbles directly after release from the overflow shaft. A full dredger hull geometry and an actuator disk accounting for propeller action add to the representation of the complexity of the flow.

40|$|The Trailing Suction <b>Hopper</b> <b>Dredgers</b> (TSHD) are {{typically}} {{used for the}} transportation of soil. The soil in the hopper can be removed by hydraulic transport using water jets and the discharge at the bottom level of the hopper. The soil fluidization and transportation is jet assisted. The unloading process can take quite some time; the unloading process can be limited by the soil transportation instead of the pumping system. The scope {{of this research is}} the optimization of the jetting system in order to deliver high mixture densities, to increase the unloading production and therefore decrease the unloading time.

50|$|The deepest {{section of}} the Fehmarn Belt Trench is 35 metres and the tunnel {{sections}} will be about 10 metres high, thus the dredging barges {{will need to be}} capable of reaching depths of over 45 metres. Dredging will produce a trench some 40-50 m wide and 12-15 m deep. These parameters give a total of some 20 million cubic metres of soils to be dredged. Conventional dredging equipment can only reach to a depth of about 25 m. To excavate the middle portion of the Fehmarn trench - deeper than 25 m below the water's surface - will likely require grab dredgers and trailing suction <b>hopper</b> <b>dredgers.</b>|$|R
