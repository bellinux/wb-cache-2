40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to design fogging nozzles as {{alternative}} stock pile dust suppression medium at gold mining sites. Furthermore, this fogging medium helps to arrest the dust without getting the area wet and without any substantial expenditure. <b>Emission</b> <b>of</b> <b>dust,</b> which is one of the main contributors to the pollution of the environment, has been associated with mining industries for years, especially in the mining towns of Ghana and Liberia. The <b>emission</b> <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> takes place mainly around the haul roads, ore drilling, blasting and trafficking areas, crushers and, and especially, the stock pile unit. The intensity <b>of</b> the <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> the <b>dust</b> is such that all the plants, objects, living things, gadgets, instruments and structures in the area are engulfed in the dust.

40|$|We {{present the}} results of {{infrared}} (IR; 2. 5 [...] 160 um) observations of the supernova remnant (SNR) Kes 17 based on the data obtained with the AKARI and Spitzer satellites. We first detect bright continuum <b>emission</b> <b>of</b> its western shell in the mid- and far-IR wavebands together with its near-IR molecular line emission. We also detect hidden mid-IR <b>emission</b> <b>of</b> its southern shell after subtraction <b>of</b> the background <b>emission</b> in this region. The far-IR luminosity of the western shell is ~ 8100 L_sun, which makes Kes 17 {{one of the few}} SNRs <b>of</b> significant far-IR <b>emission.</b> The fittings <b>of</b> the spectral energy distribution indicate the existence <b>of</b> two <b>dust</b> components: ~ 79 K (hot) and ~ 27 K (cold) corresponding to the <b>dust</b> mass <b>of</b> ~ 6. 2 x 10 ^{- 4 } M_sun and ~ 6. 7 M_sun, respectively. We suggest that the hot component represents the <b>dust</b> <b>emission</b> <b>of</b> the material swept up by the SNR to its western and southern boundaries, compatible with the distribution <b>of</b> radio continuum <b>emission</b> overlapping the mid-IR emission in the western and southern shells. The existence of hot (~ 2, 000 K), shocked dense molecular gas revealed by the near-IR molecular line emission in the western shell, on the other hand, suggests that the cold dust component represents the dust emission related to the interaction between the SNR and nearby molecular gas. The excitation conditions of the molecular gas appear to be consistent with those from shocked, clumpy admixture gas of different temperatures. We discuss three possibilities for the origin of the bright far-IR <b>emission</b> <b>of</b> the cold <b>dust</b> in the western shell: the <b>emission</b> <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> in the inter-clump medium of shocked molecular clouds, the <b>emission</b> <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> in evaporating flows of molecular clouds engulfed by hot gas, and the <b>emission</b> <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> <b>of</b> nearby molecular clouds illuminated by radiative shocks.

30|$|With the {{increasing}} consumption {{of fossil fuels}} and the heavy <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> from industry, serious environmental and health problems have drawn great attention from the public in recent years [1, 2].

Owing to the smaller droplets size, larger coverage of droplets, and wider applicability, the excellent performance of atomizing technology has motivated intensive studies in many fields [6 – 9]. However, the spray process of a twin-fluid nozzle involves multiphase coupling, dynamic changing, evaporation, and condensation, which have great influence on the stability and uniformity of droplets in the spray field and the atomizing efficiency of the twin-fluid nozzle.

Odour, dust, feathers, noises and visual aspects of poultry {{operations are}} additional issues that we must deal with to maintain good neighbor-relations. With more frequent use of tunnel fans during warm weather and more outdoor activities by neighbors, summer is often a critical time for nuisance complaints to surface. During {{the past few years}} in the USA there have been an increasing number of legal cases involving nuisance complaints associated with neighbors next to and downwind tunnel-ventilated poultry houses. Compounding nuisance concerns is the increase in human population in many historic poultry producing areas. As many poultry and livestock producing areas of the USA become more urbanized, the likelihood of increased nuisance-related complaints will only increase. These issues are exacerbated as the size of poultry farms increase. To further add to the poultry industry’s future challenges, emissions from poultry houses in the USA may be regulated in the future.

40|$|A great {{diversity}} {{is known to}} exist in the coma morphology of comets. In particular, some comets show much structural detail in their heads (such as jets, halos, fans, plumes, streamers), while others have completely structureless comas. Obvious questions arise as to why is this so and what does {{the presence or absence of}} features tell us about the emission processes on cometary nuclei. In an effort to investigate these problems, a computer code that generates synthetic images of dust comets was modified by introducing random perturbations into motions of ejected particles. It is noted that the introduction of perturbations has made the computer generated images simulate the appearance of comets quite faithfully and that by increasing the perturbations beyond a certain limit it has been possible to erase the coma morphology diagnostic of the details of the ejection process. It is proposed that the degree of collimation of an ejecta flow from discrete active sources on the nucleus surface and possible <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dust</b> coma. Molecules of comet gases that radiate in the spectral region employed (and whose velocity distribution is much more chaotic than that of dust particles) and limited atmospheric seeing likewise contribute to blurring structural detail in ground-based imaging observation of comets.
