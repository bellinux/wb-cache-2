2500|$|Length – Boards for {{children}} are {{as short as}} boards for racers, or [...] "alpine" [...] riders, are as long as [...] Most people ride boards in the [...] range. Board length used to {{be judged by the}} height of your chin. If a board held next to the <b>frontside</b> of your body came to your chin then it was an acceptable length. Due to the development of new technologies and board shapes, people can now ride a wider range of board sizes. Rather, the length of a snowboard corresponds mainly to the style, weight, and preference of the rider. A good rule of thumb is to stay within the recommended manufacturer weight range. The longer the board, the more stable it is at high speed, {{but it is also a}} bit tougher to maneuver. Another factor riders consider when selecting a snowboard is the type of riding it will be used for, freestyle boards being shorter than all-mountain boards.|$|E
40|$|Due to {{projection}} effects, coronagraphic observations cannot uniquely determine parameters {{relevant to}} the geoeffectiveness of CMEs, such as the true propagation speed, width, or source location. The Cone Model for Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) has been studied in this respect {{and it could be}} used to obtain these parameters. There are evidences that some CMEs initiate from a flux-rope topology. It seems that these CMEs should be elongated along the flux-rope axis and the cross section of the cone base should be rather elliptical than circular. In the present paper we applied an asymmetric cone model to get the real space parameters of <b>frontsided</b> halo CMEs (HCMEs) recorded by SOHO/LASCO coronagraphs in 2002. The cone model parameters are generated through a fitting procedure to the projected speeds measured at different position angles on the plane of the sky. We consider models with the apex of the cone located at the center and surface of the Sun. The results are compared to the standard symmetric cone model...|$|R
40|$|Defects on the {{backside}} of a wafer during processing can come from many sources. Particles and scratches on {{the backside}}s of wafers {{can be caused by}} wafer handling equipment such as robots and chucks, as well as by CMP processes. In addition, cross-contamination of wafers and handling equipment can occur when wafers move from tool to tool, through the production line. When wafers are exposed, backside defects can cause localized areas of poor lithography pattern resolution on the <b>frontsides</b> of wafers, resulting in increased rework rates, decreased throughput, and yield loss. As minimum feature sizes continue to shrink with each new technology node, devices become denser and exposure tool depth of focus decreases – making the elimination of lithography hot spots an even more critical issue. At a major worldwide DRAM Manufacturer, automated macro defect inspection tools for integrated front, edge, and backside inspection have been implemented to inspect wafers at After Develop Inspection (ADI) and After Clean Inspection (ACI) steps. These tools have been used to detect foreign material and scratches on the backsides of several lots that were caused by another process tool, causing photolithography hot spots. This paper describes advanced macro inspection of wafer front and back surfaces and how the inspection data was used to correlate backside defects to photolithography hot spots, and take corrective action...|$|R
50|$|Another type of End-Over. Rather than a rider doing a 180 pivot on {{the nose}} <b>frontside</b> and then doing one {{backside}} or doing one backside first and then <b>frontside</b> after, the rider pivots backside and backside or <b>frontside</b> and <b>frontside</b> giving the rider the appearance that he/she is taking very large steps forward or backward. The <b>frontside</b> variation has the rider always facing forward, and for the fakie version the rider always twists blind or backside.|$|E

They are coping and ledge tricks, manuals and flips.The various flips tricks include: Kickflip, No Comply Impossible, Double Kickflip, Fakie Kickflip, Switch Kickflip, Fakie Bigspin, Nollie Kickflip, Nollie Heelflip, Nollie <b>Frontside</b> 180 Bigspin, Varial Kickflip, Varial Heelflip, Backside 180 Kickflip, <b>Frontside</b> 180 Heelflip, <b>Frontside</b> 180 Kickflip, 360 Kickflip and the <b>Frontside</b> 180 Double Kickflip.|$|E
50|$|Varial Heelflip, {{where the}} board does one heel flip, and spins 180 degrees <b>frontside</b> (<b>frontside</b> pop shove-it) {{at the same}} time.|$|E
5000|$|A heelflip {{combined}} with a <b>frontside</b> or backside 180-degree movement—the trick {{is also known as}} a <b>frontside</b> or backside [...] "heel". Song is filmed performing a <b>frontside</b> heelflip on a transitional structure located {{on the back of a}} truck in a web-based video entitled [...] "DVS Daewon x Almost Love Child".|$|E
5000|$|When {{applied to}} tricks {{involving}} obstacles, backside and <b>frontside</b> take on different meaning: the terms define how the obstacle is being approached. For example, when performing a <b>frontside</b> boardslide, [...] "frontside" [...] {{means that the}} obstacle (e.g. rail or ledge) is to the front (the toe-side) of the skateboarder. To carry out a <b>frontside</b> boardslide, a regular-stance skater will rotate slightly clockwise before sliding, facing away {{from the direction of}} travel. This is the opposite direction of rotation to a <b>frontside</b> ollie.|$|E

50|$|The names <b>frontside</b> and {{backside}} {{originate from}} surfing where they mean {{the direction the}} surfer is facing while surfing a wave. If the surfer is facing the wave, {{he or she is}} surfing <b>frontside,</b> otherwise he or she is surfing backside. The terms forehand and backhand are synonyms for <b>frontside</b> and backside but they are only used in surfing.|$|E
5000|$|A kickflip {{combined}} with a <b>frontside</b> or backside 180-degree ollie—the trick {{is also known as}} a <b>frontside</b> or backside flip. The backside 180 kickflip was invented by Mullen in 1984. Professional skateboarder Andrew Reynolds performed a <b>frontside</b> kickflip for the [...] "Trickipedia" [...] section of The Berrics website. Professional skateboarder (and co-owner of The Berrics) Steve Berra performed a backside kickflip for the [...] "Trickipedia" [...] section of his website. Multiple spins can also be incorporated into this trick and a <b>frontside</b> 180 double kickflip was filmed for the [...] "Skateology" [...] web-based video series.|$|E
50|$|In snowboarding, <b>frontside</b> and {{backside}} {{have the}} same meanings as in skateboarding. When turning, backside is analogous to a heelside turn, and <b>frontside</b> is analogous to a toeside turn.|$|E
50|$|A plasma spin is a <b>frontside</b> bigspin impossible, {{meaning it}} is {{identical}} to a <b>frontside</b> bigspin {{except for the fact}} that board wraps around the back foot as in an impossible.|$|E
50|$|Pinches are {{classified}} as <b>frontside</b> or reverse. A right-handed player shooting a forehand shot to the right front corner is shooting a <b>frontside</b> pinch. A right-handed player shooting to the left front corner is a reverse pinch. A right-handed player shoots a backhand <b>frontside</b> pinch to the left corner and a reverse double pinch to the right corner. Everything for a left-handed player would be the opposite.|$|E
5000|$|Ollie 180: an Ollie {{where the}} {{skateboard}}er and the skateboard spins 180 degrees {{after leaving the}} ground. Both the skateboarder and the skateboard rotate {{in the same direction}} (<b>Frontside</b> or Backside) with the skateboarder's feet sticking to the skateboard. This trick is usually referred to as a <b>frontside</b> or backside 180, or less frequently and more popular with older skateboarders and/or when performed on a bank/quarterpipe, a <b>frontside</b> / backside ollie ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Frontside</b> and {{backside}} are surfing, skateboarding, snowboarding {{and aggressive}} inline skating {{terms that are}} used to describe how a person approaches an obstacle or performs a certain trick. In Aggressive Skating, <b>frontside</b> and backside are types of grinds.|$|E
5000|$|The rider may rotate {{backside}} or <b>frontside</b> {{in the air}} {{while the}} board does not. The most common variation is the Kickflip Body Varial, where the rider spin <b>frontside</b> 180 degrees, landing on the board in switch stance.|$|E

5000|$|For {{performing}} rotational {{tricks on}} flat ground, <b>frontside</b> means {{that for the}} first 90-180 degrees of the rotation, the rider rotates to face the direction of travel. For a rider traveling in the [...] "regular" [...] stance (left foot leading), <b>frontside</b> means to rotate counter clockwise (as seen from above). Conversely, a skater doing a backside rotation/trick is rotating clockwise. The same applies to horizontal board-rotation tricks, where the skater does not rotate: a regular stance skater performing a <b>frontside</b> shove-it spins the board counter clockwise, as seen from above.|$|E
