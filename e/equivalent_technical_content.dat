40|$|COMcheck {{provides}} an optional way to demonstrate compliance with commercial and high-rise residential building energy codes. Commercial buildings include all use groups except single family and multifamily not over three stories in height. COMcheck was originally based on ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90. 1 - 1989 (Standard 90. 1 - 1989) requirements and {{is intended for}} use with various codes based on Standard 90. 1, including the Codification of ASHRAE/IES Standard 90. 1 - 1989 (90. 1 - 1989 Code) (ASHRAE 1989 a, 1993 b) and ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90. 1 - 1999 (Standard 90. 1 - 1999). This includes jurisdictions that have adopted the 90. 1 - 1989 Code, Standard 90. 1 - 1989, Standard 90. 1 - 1999, or their own code based on one of these. We view Standard 90. 1 - 1989 and the 90. 1 - 1989 Code as having <b>equivalent</b> <b>technical</b> <b>content</b> and have used both as source documents in developing COMcheck. This technical support document (TSD) is designed to explain the technical basis for the COMcheck software as originally developed based on the ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90. 1 - 1989 (Standard 90. 1 - 1989). Documentation for other national model codes and standards and specific state energy codes supported in COMcheck {{has been added to}} this report as appendices. These appendices are intended to provide technical documentation for features specific to the supported codes and for any changes made for state-specific codes that differ from the standard features that support compliance with the national model codes and standards. Beginning with COMcheck version 3. 8. 0, support for 90. 1 - 1989, 90. 1 - 1999, and the 1998 IECC and version 3. 9. 0 support for 2000 and 2001 IECC are no longer included, but those sections remain in this document for reference purposes...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{quasi-experimental}} {{study was to determine}} if upper-level college students who participated in AgPAQ, an integrated course cluster learning community, would demonstrate enhanced learning in the areas of oral communication, written communication, and agronomic/economic <b>technical</b> <b>content</b> knowledge. The population (N = 182) consisted of students who participated in AgPAQ and five comparison groups: students in a farm management class; students in a stand-alone soil, fertilizer, and water management class; students in a soil, fertilizer, and water management class linked with an English course; and students in a paid volunteer group who had not previously participated in AgPAQ. Instruments included three rubrics that measured performance on written communication, oral communication, and agronomic/economic <b>technical</b> <b>content</b> knowledge. Analyses revealed that AgPAQ participants scored higher than non-AgPAQ participants on measures of oral and written communication in all comparisons. Also, AgPAQ participants scored higher on measures of agronomic/economic <b>technical</b> <b>content</b> knowledge than students in the non-AgPAQ paid volunteer group and students in the stand-alone soil, fertilizer, and water management class. AgPAQ participants also scored higher, but not significantly higher, than students in an English and agronomy linked integration.

40|$|Compact International Experience (CIE) {{courses are}} {{investigated}} as a suitable tool to raise student international awareness while retaining substantial engineering <b>technical</b> <b>content.</b> These courses were developed {{due to a}} strong student desire for engineering international studies {{as well as a}} drive by the home institution for internationalization of the curriculum. The efficacy of such courses is described through experiences gained from delivering two distinct three-semester-unit engineering elective courses in a three-week time frame in France and Australia. While each of these courses, Topics in Fluid Mechanics and Advanced Electronic Circuit Design, focused on its <b>technical</b> <b>content,</b> the desire for student understanding of the cultural environment and the impact of engineering solutions from a global and societal viewpoint were strong driving factors for each.

Students in these six groups worked in teams to generate the data for the study, team written reports and oral group presentations. The reports and presentations that were generated between 1999 and 2006 were scored by trained raters. AgPAQ and comparison group scores from Heppner 2 ̆ 7 s Problem Solving Inventory (1988), the Group Oral Communication Rubric (Barnett, 2006), the Written Communication Assessment Rubric (Barnett, 2006), and the <b>Technical</b> <b>Content</b> Assessment Rubric (Gibson, et al., 2006) were analyzed;Analyses showed that AgPAQ participants scored higher on measures of oral and written communication than did comparison group participants. Also, AgPAQ participants scored higher on measures of <b>technical</b> <b>content</b> knowledge than did students in the non-AgPAQ paid volunteer group and the Agronomy 356 group. While AgPAQ participants achieved higher <b>technical</b> <b>content</b> knowledge scores than students who participated in the 356 / 309 integration group, the difference was not statistically significant. AgPAQ participants did not achieve higher problem-solving scores than the AgEdS 450 comparison group on three scales of the problem solving inventory: (1) individual confidence in problem-solving abilities; (2) problem approach or avoidance; and (3) control of emotions and behavior;AgPAQ fostered enhanced learning in specific areas, so upper-level learning communities [...] -designed specifically for students in agriculture [...] -should be continued and used as research sites.
