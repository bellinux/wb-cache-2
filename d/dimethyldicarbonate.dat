40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{description}} and effect of usage of <b>dimethyldicarbonate</b> {{in the process}} of wine making and possibilities of its use as SO 2 substitution. Practical part then describes trials of using DMDC in three different stages of wine making which is must sterilization, stopping the fermentation and finished wine sterilization...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{was focused}} to finding {{chemicals}} an other methods that {{are able to}} reduce or replace the dose of sulfur dioxide in the wine industry. Introductory chapters deal with sulfur dioxide - its specific characteristics and forms which can be used in wine practice and way of its particular application. It was also processed a large number of literary resources with different complementary methods and provide an overview. Methods, described in this thesis, have been previously tested and they had some potential in reducing sulfur dioxide doses during the production of wine. Thesis mainly describes the interesting physical methods but {{the most important part of}} this thesis is description of chemicals with different properties and structures. The main essence of this work was experiment which studied two chemicals to reduce the doses of SO 2 [...] <b>dimethyldicarbonate</b> and higher fatty acids. The actual experiment was based on the inhibition of the four tested microorganisms in fermenting must of variety 'Marlen' and in saline (only in the case of Brettanomyces bruxellensis). Its output was counting the colonies grown on Petri dishes followed by consequential graphical demonstration of the sensitivity these microorganisms to <b>dimethyldicarbonate</b> and higher fatty acids...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to isolate, {{characterize}} and identify pathogenic microorganisms and funqi from Hylocereus polyrhizous sp. (red dragon fruit) in Kelantan. Pieces of tissues were collected from the lesion margins. After surface disinfestations with 1 % sodium hypochioride for 1 min and rinsing in sterile water three times, the diseased tissues were placed on potato dextrose agar medium plates (PDA) and incubated at 28 °C for 3 days. A dark, fast-growing fungus was isolated from all samples. For identification, single-spore cultures were grown on PDA in an incubator at 28 °C. After 5 days, colonies with dark gray to black aerial mycelium formed. The colonies produce abundant conidia that occurred in arthric chains in aerial mycelium. Macroscopic and microscopic observations were carried out on pure isolates and observations were done based on Morpohology of Fungi (S. R. Misra, 2005). Fungi isolated were Aspergilus, Rhizopus, Penicilium, and Fusarium species. Pathogenicity test for the fungi were done by using modification of bioassay of fungicide — adaption of food poison technique. Three type of fungicide were used, Thiram, <b>Dimethyldicarbonate</b> and Zineb were compared with control PDA which not containing fungicide to determine the percentage of inhibition. Fungicide Thiram show the highest percent of inhibition compare to the <b>Dimethyldicarbonate</b> and Zineb...|$|E
40|$|The {{issue of}} {{preventing}} the re-fermentation and protection against undesirable malolactic fermentation (MLF) {{in order to}} safe content of acids in wine is very complicated. In this paper the saturated higher fatty acids (HFA) – C 8, C 10 and C 12, <b>dimethyldicarbonate</b> (DMDC) and sulphur dioxide (SO 2) were tested. The re-fermentation test showed the strongest inhibition power at ratio 2 : 8, 1 : 9 and 0 : 10 as C 8 :C 10 acids – 65 days without re-fermentation. MLF experiments confirmed that addition of SO 2 into the fermenting media causes rapid inhibition of lactic acid bacteria metabolic activity. Malic acid concentrations were proportionally decreasing during 6 days of experiment {{and at the end}} the content of this acid varied between 0. 16 and 0. 22 g/L, the only exception formed a variant with the addition of SO 2 (1. 57 g/L of malic acid). After calculation of the average consumption rate of malic acid, the results showed the inhibition power – SO 2 (81. 05 %) followed by variant of 40 mg/L mixture of HFA (40. 76 %), a variant of 200 mg/L of DMDC (31. 98 %) and a variant of 20 mg/L mixture of HFA (12. 59 %). The addition of HFA can significantly reduce the dosage of other preservatives, especially SO 2. Based on results, this method can be recommend in the production of wines with residual sugar and also wines made from over-mature material to prevent undesirable MLF...|$|E
