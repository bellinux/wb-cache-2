We confirmed the causative agent, C. globosum, by KOH mount, culture, micromorphology and DNA sequence analysis...|$|E
40|$|We are {{characterizing the}} carbon {{metabolism}} and oligotrophic survival strategies of bacteria {{isolated from the}} assembly facilities for Mars spacecraft. As per NASA policy, the cleanliness of all Mars-destined spacecraft are carefully controlled {{in an effort to}} reduce microbial contamination and to minimize the probability of detecting false positive signals of life. Our collective efforts are focused on strains of Acinetobacter that have been isolated from the assembly facilities for Mars spacecraft, which are extremely tolerant towards oxidative stress and desiccation, and hence carry the potential to persist on Mars. In this presentation, we will describe our interrogations into the impacts of carbon sources on viability, oxidative <b>extremotolerance,</b> and the distribution and specific activities of selected oxidoreductase enzymes. Our experiments show that most strains of spacecraft-associated Acinetobacter grow on ethanol as a sole carbon source, with initial results supporting growth on mixtures of ethanol and 2 -propanol, which is significant, as these alcohols are used as cleaning solvents for spacecraft. Further, our experiments show that the distribution of alcohol dehydrogenase, which is involved in the metabolism of alcohols, is dependent upon growth conditions, while the distribution and specific activity of catalase, which is involved in oxidative stress, are relatively independent of carbon nutrient source. Lastly, our initial results suggest an appreciable oxidative <b>extremotolerance</b> under minimal conditions and support the metabolomic analysis of whole cells using nuclear magnetic resonance. In conclusion, the relevance of this work to the upcoming NASA and ESA life-detection missions will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|This work {{focuses on}} rock-inhabiting fungi (RIF) of Antarctic rocky deserts, {{considered}} {{the closest to}} a possible Martian habitat, as {{the best example of}} adaptation to the extremes. The study of RIF ecophysiology, resistance and adaptation provides tools that shed light on the evolution of extremophily. These studies also help define the actual limits for life and provide insight for investigating its existence beyond our planet. The scientific results obtained from over 20 years of research on the biodiversity, phylogeny and evolution toward <b>extremotolerance</b> reviewed here demonstrate how these fascinating organisms can withstand conditions well beyond those in their natural environment. A final focus is given on results and perspectives arising from a recent proteomic approach, and from astrobiological experiments and their significance for future space exploration. These studies demonstrate that Antarctic RIF offer an excellent opportunity to investigate many basic, but also applicative areas of research on extremophily. ...|$|E
40|$|The genus Fonsecaea {{comprises}} black yeast-like fungi {{of clinical}} relevance, including etiologic agents of chromoblastomycosis and cerebral phaeohyphomycosis. Presence of melanin and assimilation of monoaromatic hydrocarbons and alkylbenzenes {{have been proposed}} as virulence factors. Multicopper oxidase (MCO) is a family of enzymes including laccases, ferroxidases and ascorbate oxidases which are able to catalyze the oxidation of various aromatic organic compounds with the reduction of molecular oxygen to water. Additionally, laccases are required {{for the production of}} fungal melanins, a cell-wall black pigment recognized as a key polymer for pathogenicity and <b>extremotolerance</b> in black yeast-like fungi. Although the activity of laccase enzymes has previously been reported in many wood-rotting fungi, the diversity of laccase genes in Fonsecaea has not yet been assessed. In this study, we identified and characterized laccase-coding genes and determined their genomic location in five clinical and environmental Fonsecaea species. The identification of laccases sensu stricto will provide insights into carbon acquisition strategies as well as melanin production in Fonsecaea...|$|E
40|$|Ground {{simulation}} tests {{are necessary for}} selection {{of the most promising}} biological organisms for flight experiments in Low Earth Orbit or other space destinations: Simulation of the environmental parameters of the mission, as well as of sample assembly and disassembly, need to be performed, allowing the qualification of the experiment and facilitating the post-flight analysis of the exposed biological material and thus, {{a deeper understanding of the}} individual and synergistic effects of space. This work is a presentation of the results obtained with the lichen species Circinaria gyrosa, after the Experiment Verification tests (EVT) and Space Verification tests (SVT) in the frame of the EXPOSE-R 2 Mission Preflight Test Program, performed at DLR (Cologne, Germany), as part of the EXPOSE-R 2 Mission Preflight Test Program. The high vitality and resistance capacity of C. gyrosa, demonstrated with the PSII values measured after reactivation in the laboratory and the CLSM (Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy) results confirm the high survival potential of these species to space and Mars conditions, taking part of the BIOMEX experiment (Biology and Mars Experiment, EXPOSE R- 2, ISS, 2016 - 2018) and contributing to our understanding of <b>extremotolerance</b> and the Lithopanspermia hypothesis...|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of astrobiological {{exposure}} and simulation experiments in the BIOMEX project, the lichen Circinaria gyrosa was investigated by Raman microspectroscopy. Owing to the symbiotic nature of lichens and their remarkable <b>extremotolerance,</b> C. gyrosa represents a valid model organism in recent and current astrobiological research. Biogenic compounds of C. gyrosa were studied that may serve as biomarkers in Raman assisted remote sensing missions, e. g. ExoMars. The surface as well as different internal layers of C. gyrosa have been characterized and data on the detectability and distribution of β-carotene, chitin and calcium oxalate monohydrate (whewellite) are presented in this study. Raman microspectroscopy was applied on natural samples and thin sections. Although calcium oxalates can also be formed by rare geological processes it {{may serve as a}} suitable biomarker for astrobiological investigations. In the model organism C. gyrosa, it forms extracellular crystalline deposits embedded in the intra-medullary space and its function is assumed to balance water uptake and gas exchange during the rare, moist to wet environmental periods that are physiologically favourable. This is a factor that was repeatedly demonstrated to be essential for extremotolerant lichens and other organisms. Depending on the decomposition processes of whewellite under extraterrestrial environmental conditions, it may not only serve as a biomarker of recent life, but also of past and fossilized organisms...|$|E
40|$|Fonsecaea and Cladophialophora are genera {{of black}} yeast-like fungi {{harboring}} agents of a mutilating implantation disease in humans, along with strictly environmental species. The current hypothesis suggests that those species reside in somewhat adverse microhabitats, and pathogenic siblings share virulence factors enabling survival in mammal tissue after coincidental inoculation driven by pathogenic adaptation. A comparative genomic analysis {{of environmental and}} pathogenic siblings of Fonsecaea and Cladophialophora was undertaken, including de novo assembly of F. erecta from plant material. The genome size of Fonsecaea species varied between 33. 39 and 35. 23 Mb, and the core genomes of those species comprises almost 70 % of the genes. Expansions of protein domains such as glyoxalases and peptidases suggested ability for pathogenicity in clinical agents, while the use of nitrogen and degradation of phenolic compounds was enriched in environmental species. The similarity of carbohydrate-active vs. protein-degrading enzymes associated with the occurrence of virulence factors suggested a general tolerance to extreme conditions, which might explain the opportunistic tendency of Fonsecaea sibling species. Virulence was tested in the Galleria mellonella model and immunological assays were performed {{in order to support}} this hypothesis. Larvae infected by environmental F. erecta had a lower survival. Fungal macrophage murine co-culture showed that F. erecta induced high levels of TNF-α contributing to macrophage activation that could increase the ability to control intracellular fungal growth although hyphal death were not observed, suggesting a higher level of <b>extremotolerance</b> of environmental species...|$|E
40|$|Lichens, {{which are}} symbioses of a fungus {{and one or}} two photoautotrophs, {{frequently}} tolerate extreme environmental conditions. This makes them valuable modelsystems in astrobiological research to fathom the limits and limitations of eukaryotic symbioses. Various studies demonstrated the high resistance of selected extremotolerant lichens towards extreme, non-terrestrial abiotic factors including space exposure, hypervelocity impact simulations as well as space and Martian parameter simulations. This study focusses on the diverse set of secondary lichen compounds (SLCs) that act as photo- and UVR-protective substances. Five lichen species used in present-day astrobiological research were compared: Buellia frigida, Circinaria gyrosa, Rhizocarpon geographicum, Xanthoria elegans, and Pleopsidium chlorophanum. Detailed investigation of secondary substances including photosynthetic pigments was performed for whole lichen thalli but also for axenically cultivated mycobionts and photobionts by methods of UV/VIS-spectrophotometry and two types of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Additionally, a set of chemical tests is presented to confirm the formation of melanic compounds in lichen and mycobiont samples. All investigated lichens reveal various sets of SLCs, except C. gyrosa where only melanin was putatively identified. Such studies will help to assess the contribution of SLCs on lichen <b>extremotolerance,</b> to understand the adaptation of lichens to prevalent abiotic stressors of the respective habitat, and to form a basis for interpreting recent and future astrobiological experiments. As most of the identified SLCs demonstrated a high capacity in absorbing UVR, they may also explain the high resistance of lichens towards non-terrestrial UVR...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRock {{surfaces}} are unique terrestrial habitats in which rapid {{changes in the}} intensity of radiation, temperature, water supply and nutrient availability challenge the survival of microbes. A specialised, but diverse group of free-living, melanised fungi are amongst the persistent settlers of bare rocks. Multigene phylogenetic analyses were used to study relationships of ascomycetes {{from a variety of}} substrates, with a dataset including a broad sampling of rock dwellers from different geographical locations. Rock-inhabiting fungi appear particularly diverse in the early diverging lineages of the orders Chaetothyriales and Verrucariales. Although these orders share a most recent common ancestor, their lifestyles are strikingly different. Verrucariales are mostly lichen-forming fungi, while Chaetothyriales, by contrast, are best known as opportunistic pathogens of vertebrates (e. g. Cladophialophora bantiana and Exophiala dermatitidis, both agents of fatal brain infections) and saprophytes. The rock-dwelling habit is shown here to be key to the evolution of these two ecologically disparate orders. The most recent common ancestor of Verrucariales and Chaetothyriales is reconstructed as a non-lichenised rock-inhabitant. Ancestral state reconstructions suggest Verrucariales as one of the independent ascomycetes group where lichenisation has evolved on a hostile rock surface that might have favored this shift to a symbiotic lifestyle. Rock-inhabiting fungi are also ancestral to opportunistic pathogens, as they are found in the early diverging lineages of Chaetothyriales. In Chaetothyriales and Verrucariales, specific morphological and physiological traits (here referred to as <b>extremotolerance)</b> evolved in response to stresses in extreme conditions prevailing on rock surfaces. These factors facilitated colonisation of various substrates including the brains of vertebrates by opportunistic fungal pathogens, as well as helped establishment of a stable lichen symbiosis...|$|E

40|$|The order Chaetothyriales (Pezizomycotina, Ascomycetes) {{harbours}} obligatorily melanised fungi {{and includes}} numerous etiologic agents of chromoblastomycosis, phaeohyphomycosis {{and other diseases}} of vertebrate hosts. Diseases range from mild cutaneous to fatal cerebral or disseminated infections and affect humans and cold-blooded animals globally. In addition, Chaetothyriales comprise species with aquatic, rock-inhabiting, ant-associated, and mycoparasitic life-styles, as well as species that tolerate toxic compounds, suggesting {{a high degree of}} versatile <b>extremotolerance.</b> To understand their biology and divergent niche occupation, we sequenced and annotated a set of 23 genomes of main the human opportunists within the Chaetothyriales as well as related environmental species. Our analyses included fungi with diverse life-styles, namely opportunistic pathogens and closely related saprobes, to identify genomic adaptations related to pathogenesis. Furthermore, ecological preferences of Chaetothyriales were analysed, in conjuncture with the order-level phylogeny based on conserved ribosomal genes. General characteristics, phylogenomic relationships, transposable elements, sex-related genes, protein family evolution, genes related to protein degradation (MEROPS), carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), melanin synthesis and secondary metabolism were investigated and compared between species. Genome assemblies varied from 25. 81  Mb (Capronia coronata) to 43. 03  Mb (Cladophialophora immunda). The bantiana-clade contained the highest number of predicted genes (12   817 on average) as well as larger genomes. We found a low content of mobile elements, with DNA transposons from Tc 1 /Mariner superfamily being the most abundant across analysed species. Additionally, we identified a reduction of carbohydrate degrading enzymes, specifically many of the Glycosyl Hydrolase (GH) class, while most of the Pectin Lyase (PL) genes were lost in etiological agents of chromoblastomycosis and phaeohyphomycosis. An expansion was found in protein degrading peptidase enzyme families S 12 (serine-type D-Ala-D-Ala carboxypeptidases) and M 38 (isoaspartyl dipeptidases). Based on genomic information, a wide range of abilities of melanin biosynthesis was revealed; genes related to metabolically distinct DHN, DOPA and pyomelanin pathways were identified. The MAT (MAting Type) locus and other sex-related genes were recognized in all 23 black fungi. Members of the asexual genera Fonsecaea and Cladophialophora appear to be heterothallic with a single copy of either MAT- 1 - 1 or MAT- 1 - 2 in each individual. All Capronia species are homothallic as both MAT 1 - 1 and MAT 1 - 2 genes were found in each single genome. The genomic synteny of the MAT-locus flanking genes (SLA 2 -APN 2 -COX 13) is not conserved in black fungi as is commonly observed in Eurotiomycetes, indicating a unique genomic context for MAT in those species. The heterokaryon (het) genes expansion associated with the low selective pressure at the MAT-locus suggests that a parasexual cycle may {{play an important role in}} generating diversity among those fungi...|$|E
