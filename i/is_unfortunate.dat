5|$|A {{continuous}} map between two topological spaces induces a group homomorphism between the associated homotopy groups. In particular, if the map is a continuous bijection (a homeomorphism), {{so that the}} two spaces have the same topology, then their i-th homotopy groups are isomorphic for all i. However, the real plane has exactly the same homotopy groups as a solitary point (as does a Euclidean space of any dimension), and the real plane with a point removed has the same groups as a circle, so groups alone are not enough to distinguish spaces. Although the loss of discrimination power <b>is</b> <b>unfortunate,</b> it can also make certain computations easier.|$|E
5|$|Given this, it <b>is</b> <b>unfortunate</b> {{that the}} Cypria—the {{part of the}} Epic Cycle that covers {{the period of the}} Trojan War of Troilus' death—does not survive. Indeed, no {{complete}} narrative of his story remains from archaic times or the subsequent classical period (479–323 BC). Most of the literary sources from before the Hellenistic age (323–30 BC) that even referred to the character are lost or survive only in fragments or summary. The surviving ancient and medieval sources, whether literary or scholarly, contradict each other, and many do not tally with the form of the myth that scholars now believe to have existed in the archaic and classical periods.|$|E
5|$|Vijay is {{admitted}} to hospital, where Dr.Ashok Gilwani gives him scars identical to Don's. When Don suddenly dies, the masquerade begins. Vijay, as Don, joins the gang in Kuala Lumpur. DeSilva asks Vijay {{to find a}} computer disc containing details about the cartel {{and bring it to}} him. When Vijay finds it, Roma attempts to kill him, but DeSilva tells her about his plan, and she agrees to help him. Vijay hands over the disc to DeSilva. When DeSilva murders Singhania, the police arrive and arrest Vijay. DeSilva is killed in the shoot-out, which <b>is</b> <b>unfortunate</b> for Vijay because DeSilva was the only person who could prove that he is not the real Don. Having discovered his true identity, Don's associates turn against Vijay and the group engage in a fight. Vijay escapes and reconciles with Roma to recover the disc and prove his innocence.|$|E

25|$|A {{problem in}} the field is that {{detailed}} neuron descriptions are computationally expensive and this can handicap the pursuit of realistic network investigations, where many neurons need to be simulated. So, researchers that study large neural circuits typically represent each neuron and synapse simply, ignoring much of the biological detail. This <b>is</b> <b>unfortunate</b> as there is evidence that the richness of biophysical properties on the single neuron scale can supply mechanisms that serve as the building blocks for network dynamics. Hence there is a drive to produce simplified neuron models that can retain significant biological fidelity at a low computational overhead. Algorithms have been developed to produce faithful, faster running, simplified surrogate neuron models from computationally expensive, detailed neuron models.|$|E

25|$|The IRA gave clear {{reasons for}} the execution. I think it <b>is</b> <b>unfortunate</b> that anyone has to be killed, but the furor created by Mountbatten's death showed up the hypocritical {{attitude}} of the media establishment. As {{a member of the}} House of Lords, Mountbatten was an emotional figure in both British and Irish politics. What the IRA did to him is what Mountbatten had been doing all his life to other people; and with his war record I don't think he could have objected to dying in what was clearly a war situation. He knew the danger involved in coming to this country. In my opinion, the IRA achieved its objective: people started paying attention to what was happening in Ireland.|$|E
25|$|Goryeo (Koryo) {{architecture}} {{is defined as}} the period between the 10th century and the 14th century. Much of the architecture in this period was related to religion and influenced by political power/ kingdom. Many buildings such as magnificent Buddhist temples and pagodas were developed based on religious needs, as Buddhism {{played an important role in}} the culture and society at the time. It <b>is</b> <b>unfortunate</b> that little has survived to the present day, since most of the architecture from this period was built of wood. Also, the capital of the Goryeo dynasty was based in Gaesong, a city in modern-day North Korea. Its location has made it difficult for many historians in South Korea to study and analyze the architecture of this era.|$|E
25|$|Michael Palumbo, {{author of}} The Palestinian Catastrophe: The 1948 Expulsion of a People from Their Homeland, {{reviewing}} {{the first edition}} of Morris's book on Palestinian refugees, criticizes Morris's decision, which Palumbo thinks characteristic of Israeli revisionist historians generally, to rely mainly on official, 'carefully screened' Israeli sources, especially for radio transcripts of Arab broadcasts, while disregarding unofficial Israeli sources such as BBC and CIA transcripts, many of which point to a policy of expulsion. He says Morris failed to supplement his work in Israeli archives, many still classified, by U.N., American, and British archival sources that Palumbo considers objective on such issues as IDF atrocities, as well as oral testimonies of Palestinians and Israelis, which can be reliable if their substance can be independently verified. Palumbo says:Morris' regard for documentation is indeed commendable, were it not for his tendency to choose sources which support his views, while avoiding those document collections which contain information inconsistent with his principal arguments. His decision not to use the testimony of Israeli veterans <b>is</b> <b>unfortunate,</b> since some of them have spoken candidly about Israeli atrocities and expulsion of civilians at Deir Yassin, Lydda–Ramle and Jaffa.|$|E

25|$|Bhishma {{is often}} {{considered}} as {{a great example of}} devotion and sacrifice. His name itself is an honour to him - Bhishma which means severe because he took a severe vow to remain celibate for life and Pitamah which means Grandfather. Bhishma {{was one of the greatest}} Bramhacharis of all time. Accumulation of Ojas due to his Bramhacharyam made him the strongest warrior of the era. He had stature and personality that in those times were fit for kings. He was a true Kshatriya as well as a disciplined ascetic - a rare combination. Like a true Kshatriya, he never unnecessarily exhibited passion and anger. A symbol of truth and duty, the benevolent Bhishma was in all senses a true human. It <b>is</b> <b>unfortunate</b> that a person as noble as Bhishma saw a life full of loneliness, frustration and sadness. But that was how Vashishta's curse was supposed to unfold. Bhishma's human birth was destined to be marked with suffering, and that was how his life transpired right till the last moment; even his death was very painful. But the strong as steel character which he possessed ensured that he never shied away from his duty, and never stopped loving those dear to him.|$|E
25|$|The 80-bit {{floating}} point format has a range (including subnormals) from approximately 3.65104951 to 1.18104932. Although log10(264)≅19.266, this format is usually described as giving approximately eighteen significant digits of precision. The use of decimal {{when talking about}} binary <b>is</b> <b>unfortunate</b> because most decimal fractions are recurring sequences in binary just as 2/3 is in decimal. Thus, a value such as 10.15 is represented in binary as equivalent to 10.1499996185 etc. in decimal for REAL*4 but 10.15000000000000035527etc. in REAL*8: interconversion will involve approximation except for those few decimal fractions that represent an exact binary value, such as 0.625. For REAL*10, the decimal string is 10.1499999999999999996530553etc. The last 9 digit is the eighteenth fractional digit and thus the twentieth significant digit of the string. Bounds on conversion between decimal and binary for the 80-bit format can be given as follows: if a decimal string with at most 18 significant digits is correctly rounded to an 80-bit IEEE 754 binary {{floating point}} value (as on input) then converted {{back to the same}} number of significant decimal digits (as for output), then the final string will exactly match the original; while, conversely, if an 80-bit IEEE 754 binary floating point value is correctly converted and (nearest) rounded to a decimal string with at least 21 significant decimal digits then converted back to binary format it will exactly match the original. These approximations are particularly troublesome when specifying the best value for constants in formulae to high precision, as might be calculated via arbitrary precision arithmetic.|$|E

Then-Prime Minister of Sweden Ingvar Carlsson said the results were [...] "tragic", and the then-leader of the Centre Party, Olof Johansson, called the ban [...] "improper".
