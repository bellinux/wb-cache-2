The {{function}} of <b>access</b> <b>programmes</b> is to provide support and additional time for under-prepared students {{to cope with the}} academic workload during the first year. This article aims to indicate the value students place on participation in an <b>access</b> <b>programme.</b> In this qualitative study, group interviews were conducted and the findings indicate that Engineering students attribute their success in the mainstream {{to the way in which}} participation in an <b>access</b> <b>programme</b> had integrated them academically into the university and exposed them to discipline related experiences in a non-threatening environment. The findings of this study indicate what aspects of the <b>access</b> <b>programme</b> students considered helpful for perseverance in mainstream studies. It is recommended that institutions that offer <b>access</b> <b>programmes</b> should not only be aware of the reciprocal influence of the cognitive and non-cognitive factors that affect students’ success, but also purposefully combine these factors in the design of their <b>access</b> <b>programmes...</b>|$|R

Despite the many advantages of alternate <b>access</b> <b>programmes</b> documented in literature, numerous Engineering Faculty members {{and members of the}} management of the University of Johannesburg believed that first time applicants with A and B symbols on their senior certificate were stronger students than those students who had completed an alternate <b>access</b> <b>programme.</b> Furthermore, they felt that the alternate access students took up the places which should have been given to those students with excellent senior certificate results. While many studies have been conducted on alternate <b>access</b> <b>programmes</b> {{there appears to be no}} evidence of the academic benefits that students derive from them. This generic qualitative study focused on what students perceive to be the academic benefits of alternate <b>access</b> <b>programmes</b> for their mainstream study. Purposeful sampling was used to select Engineering students from the 2005 and 2006 cohort to participate in focus group interviews and the data gathered during the interviews were analysed and interpreted using an Interpretivist lens. The themes that emerged from the study confirmed that students found the programmes to be beneficial but that they became aware of most of the academic benefits only once they joined the mainstream students in their second year of study. This study revealed the alternate access students were of the opinion that there are a number of academic benefits that they had derived from the alternate <b>access</b> <b>programmes.</b> They were in agreement that these benefits had helped to prepare them for mainstream study and they concluded that the benefits had contributed to their academic success in their mainstream studies. The findings of this study suggest that alternate <b>access</b> <b>programmes</b> have an important role to play in providing students with access, support and success in mainstream studies which in turn leads to the increased throughput of students and {{higher education}} institutions retaining subsidy...|$|R

40|$|Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) was {{developed}} to support efficient wireless <b>data</b> <b>access.</b> Since <b>data</b> transmission capacity of wireless link is limited, a caching model was proposed for WAP to reduce the <b>data</b> <b>access</b> time.

40|$|Abstract—The lasting memory-wall problem {{combined}} with the newly emerged big-data problem makes <b>data</b> <b>access</b> delay the first citizen of performance optimizations of cluster computing. Reduction of <b>data</b> <b>access</b> delay, however, is application dependent. It depends on the <b>data</b> <b>access</b> behaviors of the underlying applications. Therefore, leaning and understanding <b>data</b> <b>access</b> behaviors is a must for effective <b>data</b> <b>access</b> optimizations. Modern microprocessors are equipped with hardware data prefetchers, which predict <b>data</b> <b>access</b> patterns and prefetch data for CPU. However, memory systems in design {{do not have the}} capability to understand <b>data</b> <b>access</b> behaviors for performance optimizations. In this study, we propose a novel approach, named KNOWAC, to collect I/O information automatically through highlevel I/O libraries. KNOWAC accumulates I/O knowledge and reveals data usage patterns by exploring the collected highlevel I/O characteristics. The discovered data usage patterns can be used for different I/O optimizations. We apply KNOWAC to I/O prefetch under the framework of PnetCDF in this study. Experimental results on a real-world application show that KNOWAC is promising and has a true practical value in mitigating the I/O bottleneck. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In process-driven, service-oriented {{architectures}} (SOAs), process {{activities can}} perform service operations, data transformations, or human tasks. Unfortunately, the process activities are usually tightly coupled. Thus, {{when the number}} of activities in the process grows, focusing on particular activities of the flow such as the service operations reading or writing persistent data is a time-consuming task. In particular, in order to solve structural problems concerning persistent <b>data</b> <b>access</b> such as deadlocks in data-intensive business processes, stakeholders need to understand the underlying persistent <b>data</b> <b>access</b> details of the activities i. e. physical storage schemes, and database connections. With our view-based model-driven approach, we provide a solution to generate flows of persistent <b>data</b> <b>access</b> activities (which we refer to as persistent <b>data</b> <b>access</b> flows). To {{the best of our knowledge}} these persistent <b>data</b> <b>access</b> flows are not used to solve structural problems in process-driven SOAs, yet. Moreover, our persistent <b>data</b> <b>access</b> flows can be flattened by diverse filer criteria e. g. by filtering all activities reading or writing from a specific database or table. Using our approach, we can enhance traceability and documentation of persistent <b>data</b> <b>access</b> in business processes. In a series of motivating scenarios from an industrial case study we present how our persistent <b>data</b> <b>access</b> flow concept can contribute to enhance productivity in service...|$|R

40|$|Data prefetching, where data is fetched before CPU {{demands for}} it, has been {{considered}} as an effective solution to mask <b>data</b> <b>access</b> latency.
