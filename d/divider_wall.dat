40|$|AbstractPurpose: Many {{studies have}} linked carotid plaque surface {{irregularities}} with stroke risk, but this {{relationship has been}} obscured by the limited ability of available imaging modalities to resolve plaque surface morphology. To address this issue, we performed a prospective study correlating the presenting neurologic symptoms of patients with {{high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI; 200 μm) studies of ipsilateral plaque surface invaginations and ledges, lumen shape, and the location of the plaque bulk creating the stenosis. Methods: One hundred patients, 17 women and 83 men, 45 to 81 years old (mean, 68 years) underwent surgery. Forty-five patients had a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke as the indication for surgery, and 55 patients had no symptoms. Angiograms were obtained in 50 patients. Carotid plaques were removed “en bloc” and placed in gadolinium doped saline for imaging in a Siemens Symphony, 1. 5 T scanner with a custom-built transmit-receive radiofrequency coil. The resulting slice thickness was 200 μm, with 200 μm by 200 μm in plane resolution. The MRI data and angiograms were reviewed by using National Institutes of Health Image software and read by consensus. A surface irregularity was categorized as a ledge or ulcer and measured by using electronic calipers. Luminal shape was determined at the point of maximal stenosis with a “slice” set at 90 ° to the lumen axis. The location of the maximal stenosis was recorded. In the internal carotid artery, plaque bulk was designated to be on the flow <b>divider</b> <b>wall</b> or non-flow <b>divider</b> <b>wall.</b> Results: The mean maximal stenosis was 81. 5 % ± 12. 0 %. Surface contour irregularities were found in 80 plaques. Thirty-five plaques were graded as having major surface contour irregularities, and 45 plaques were graded as having minor irregularities. There was a significant correlation between major surface irregularity and TIA or stroke (P <. 01). Irregular plaques were identified with angiography, but the irregularity in size was underestimated (P <. 01). Only 28 % of plaques had circular lumens; 50 % had elliptical lumens, and 22 % had either crescentic or multi-lobular lumens. The maximal stenosis was located in the internal carotid artery in 82 plaques, the bifurcation in 17 plaques, and the common carotid artery in one plaque. Conclusion: Surface irregularities were revealed by means of submillimeter resolution of the carotid plaques with MRI to be common, but only the presence of major irregularities correlated with the patient having TIA or stroke. Lumen shape and plaque location did not appear to predict stroke risk, but may effect imaging accuracy in determining the degree of stenosis.

We assessed the plaque distribution and morphology near bifurcations non-invasively with 64 -slice computed tomography in relation to the WSS distribution. Methods and results: We inspected 65 cross-sections near coronary bifurcations for the presence of plaque. Cross-sections were divided into four equal parts, which we numbered according to expected levels of WSS, with part I the lowest WSS (outer wall) and increasing WSS's in part II (inner bend), III (outer bend) and IV (flow divider). Of the cross-sections 88 % had plaque. Of all parts I, 72 % contained plaque. This was 62 %, 38 % and 31 % in parts II, III and IV. In cross-sections with only 1 or 2 parts inflicted, plaque was found in part I and/or II in 94 %. In 93 % of the cross-sections with the flow divider inflicted, parts I and/or II were also inflicted. Plaque was never found exclusively in the flow divider part IV. Conclusions: We demonstrated that plaque is mostly present in low WSS regions, whereas plaque in high WSS regions is accompanied by plaque in adjacent low WSS regions.

Initial strain measurements were made on ENGIN-X (Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, UK) on three turbine housings selected from various stages in the manufacturing process. Measurements were made on a region of the housing where failures (cracks) have been recorded after accelerated durability tests, although these have never been predicted by FEA.

40|$|The {{stationary}} flow {{of blood}} in a two-dimensional model of the bifurcation of the human carotid artery is simulated numerically using a finite element method. The Reynolds number is taken as equal to 300, corresponding to the value during the end-diastolic phase of the heart cycle. As constitutive equations, the Newtonian model and the non-Newtonian power-law and Casson models are used. The chosen model parameters corresponded with blood. The flow in this geometry {{is determined by the}} branching of the artery and the existence of a reversed flow area in the internal carotid artery. From the results of this problem, we conclude that the general flow structure is not influenced by the generalized (non-) Newtonian models. However, there are differences that cannot be neglected. First, the generalized Newtonian models result in axial and secondary velocity profiles that have 5 - 10 % lower maximum values compared to the Newtonian model. Second, the pressure has higher values {{in the case of the}} generalized Newtonian models, especially in the internal carotid artery where these models give maximal 25 % higher pressure values.

40|$|In {{the present}} study a {{two-dimensional}} finite element model for incompressible Newtonian flow is applicated to the modelling of carotid artery flow. In earlier studies, the numerical model was validated experimentally for several flow configurations. In general the pulsatile flow is characterized by reversed flow regions at the non-divider side walls of both {{the internal and external}} carotid arteries. The unsteadiness of the flow is associated with rather complex spatial and temporal velocity distributions and leads to temporal variations of the location and length of the reversed flow regions. As a consequence, pronounced spatial and temporal variations in the wall shear stresses are found. At the non-divider side walls, wall shear stresses are relatively low and exhibits an oscillatory behaviour in space and time. At the <b>divider</b> side <b>walls,</b> wall shear stresses are relatively high and approximately follow the flow rate distribution in time. The aim of this study is not only to present two-dimensional calculations but also to compare the calculated two-dimensional velocity profiles with those from three-dimensional experiments. It is observed that in the common carotid artery and in the proximal parts of the internal and external carotid arteries, the two-dimensional numerical model provides valuable information with respect to the three-dimensional configuration. In the more distal parts of especially the internal carotid artery, deviations are found between the two-dimensional numerical and three-dimensional experimental model. These deviations can mainly be attributed to the neglect of the secondary velocity distribution in the two-dimensional model. In the two-dimensional numerical model the influence of a minor stenosis in the internal carotid artery is hardly distinguishable from a minor geometrical variation without stenosis. Full three-dimensional analyses of the influence of minor stenoses are needed to prove numerically whether in-vivo measurements of the axial velocity distribution are useful in the detection of minor stenoses...|$|R

When an enemy is hidden behind a <b>wall</b> <b>divider,</b> the player can throw a grenade next to it to send the cover flying through the air, rendering the enemy unprotected. The Havok engine was tweaked to make weapons, bombs, and Molotov cocktails act more naturally, and the audio was updated to make them sound more realistic. The new physics engine allowed for certain actions that could not happen in Max Payne; boxes can be moved and follow the laws of gravitation, and explosion detonations make enemy bodies fall realistically.|$|R
40|$|The City of Rochester {{plans to}} {{excavate}} the Culver-Goodman tunnel and connect {{it to the}} existing Cross-Irondequoit tunnel through a control structure. Several dropshafts will convey the effluent from surface collection facilities to the storage and conveyance tunnel. The function of these dropshafts is to transport the water from one elevation and energy level to a lower elevation and energy level and, in the process, to dissipate energy and remove the entrained air. The term "dropshaft" is sometimes used collectively to include the various components of the structure. Conduits {{at or near the}} ground surface collect the water and convey it to an elbow which deflects the flow about 90 degrees into the vertical drop shaft. The vertical shaft is divided by a slotted wall which separates the falling water-air mixture and the released air returning to the surface. In the elbow and vertical shaft the falling water entrains considerable amounts of air and gains kinetic energy. The vertical shaft terminates in a sump, which is a large excavated and lined chamber. The purpose of the sump is to dissipate some of the energy, to remove and co~lect the entrained air, and to direct the water at a reduced velocity into the exit conduit. The sloping roof of the sump guides the collected air back to the vent side of the vertical shaft. A portion of the rising air is drawn through the slots in the <b>divider</b> <b>wall</b> and re-· entrained in the falling water; the excess air returns to the surface. The exit conduit conveys the water into the tunnel. A typical model including all of these componentsDivision Of Pure Waters; Lozier Engineers Inc; Harza Engineering Compan...|$|E
40|$|Laser Doppler {{anemometer}} (LDA) {{experiments were}} performed to gain quantitative information on {{the differences between the}} large-scale flow phenomena in a non-stenosed and a stenosed model of the carotid artery bifurcation. The influence of the presence of the stenosis was compared to the effect of flow pulse variation to evaluate the feasibility of early detection of stenosis in clinical practice. Three-dimensional Plexiglass models of a non-stenosed and a 25 % stenosed carotid artery bifurcation were perfused with a Newtonian fluid. The flow conditions approximated physiological flow. The results of the velocity measurements in the non-stenosed model agreed with the results from previous hydrogen-bubble visualization. A shear layer separated the low-velocity area near the non-divider wall from the high-velocity area near the <b>divider</b> <b>wall.</b> In this shear layer, vortex formation occurred during the deceleration phase of the flow pulse. The instability of this shear layer dictated the flow disturbances. The influences of the mild stenosis, located at the non-divider wall, was mainly limited to the stability of the shear layer. No disturbances were found downstream of the stenosis near the non-divider wall. Using a pulse wave with an increased systolic deceleration time, the velocity distribution showed an extended region with reversed flow, a more pronounced shear layer and increased vortex strength. From these measurements {{it is obvious that the}} influence of the presence of a mild stenosis, mainly limited to the stability of the shear layer, can hardly be distinguished from the effects of a variation of the flow pulse. From this it can be concluded that methods for detection of mild stenosis, using solely the large-scale flow phenomena, as can be measured by ultrasound or MRI techniques, will hardly have any clinical relevance...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the effect of {{geometric}} changes of mild stenoses on large-scale flow disturbances in the carotid artery bifurcation. Hydrogen-bubble visualisation experiments have been performed in Plexiglas models of a non-stenosed and a 25 % stenosed carotid artery bifurcation. The flow conditions approximate physiological flow. The experiments show that shortly after {{the onset of the}} diastolic phase vortex formation occurs in the plane of symmetry. This vortex formation is found in a shear layer, which is formed in the carotid sinus. The shear layer is located between a region with low shear rates at the non-divider wall and a region with high shear rates at the <b>divider</b> <b>wall.</b> In order to gain insight into the parameters that are important with respect to the stability of the shear layer, experiments have been performed in which the influence of the shape of the flow pulse, the Reynolds number (Re), the Womersley parameter (a) and the flow division ratio (¿) on the flow phenomena is studied. From these experiments it appears that the flow phenomena in the carotid artery bifurcation are significantly influenced by Re, a the systolic acceleration (sa) and deceleration (sd) and the duration of the peak-systolic flow (Tmax). With these results a simplified flow pulse is chosen, with which the experiments in the non-stenosed and the 25 % stenosed bifurcation are performed. Comparison of the hydrogen-bubble profiles in the 0 and 25 % stenosed models with similar flow conditions shows that the geometric change of the 25 % stenosis only slightly influences the flow phenomena. The most striking influences are found in the stability of the shear layer. Quantitative experiments by means of laser Doppler anemometry measurements and numerical computations are needed to analyse the influence of the stenosis of the flow field more accurately...|$|E
40|$|The {{harvesting}} {{of sugar}} cane {{is the first}} stage in the commercial milling of sugar cane to produce sugar and {{plays a major role}} in determining the overall efficiency of the sugar production process. In Australia, where virtually all sugar cane is harvested using mechanical harvesters, efficient operation of the harvester is essential to reduce operating costs. One area of harvesting that has, on numerous occasions, been identified as an impediment to improved harvester efficiency is the adjustment of the base cutter height. Improper setting during harvesting has a number of serious consequences for sugar production including reduced production, crop damage, additional harvester running costs and inefficient transportation and milling of the sugar cane due to the introduction of dirt. The overall aim of this thesis was to develop a ground detection sensor based on microwave radar technology that could sense ground level in front of a working sugar cane harvester. The eventual purpose of such a device would be to automatically control the cutting height to the optimum level and thus improving the efficiency of the harvesting, farming and milling processes. The measurement technique investigated is based upon the use of a radio transmitter and receiver positioned on either side of the row of sugar cane. The principle of this design is that a receiver close to ground level would experience more attenuation from the soil than a receiver positioned well above ground level. Thus, it was suggested that changes in the received signal strength with respect to the height above ground level could be used to detect changes in the height of the ground. The project evolved in two main stages. Initially, work concentrated on verifying the sensing principle in the laboratory and later in the field. Testing verified the proposed measurement procedure with the following major conclusions. Firstly, for best results a radio signal of 2 - 3 GHz polarised horizontal to the ground was most suitable. This signal provided the best compromise between being insensitive to the presence of the sugar cane while still allowing practical sized antennas to be employed. Secondly, field-testing showed that the sugar cane stalks do affect the ideal sensor response with the orientation and condition (density, leaf matter, etc) of the sugar cane having a noticeable influence on the measurements. These results suggested that a practical sensor would need to incorporate automatic compensation for the variations in the sugar cane and that some averaging or signal processing would have to be applied to remove the underlying trends. The second stage of the project involved building a prototype sensor and testing it on a working sugar cane harvester. The prototype worked by measuring the received amplitude of a 2. 4 GHz, horizontally polarised microwave radio signal that was transmitted from one side of the sugar cane row to the other. For this application, multiple receivers are stacked vertically to measure the full height profile instantaneously. The idea of using multiple receivers with some positioned well above the ground level, was to compensate for the changing density of the sugar cane. The transmitter and receiver antennas were based on rectangular microstrip patch antenna arrays. The low profile of these patch antennas meant that they were ideal for flush mounting on the harvesters’ crop <b>divider</b> <b>walls.</b> Dedicated transmitter and receiver electronics was also needed to generate and detect the microwave radio signals used by this system. A full control system and data logger was developed for this application. The prototype sensor that was developed was trialled on an Austoft harvester over a one week period in the Burnett region. These tests were used to confirm that the sensor would work and that it could survive the harsh conditions experienced during harvesting. Overall, the aim of this thesis was to test the potential of the microwave ground height detection sensor for automated control of the base cutter height on sugar cane harvester and to develop a plan to use this technology in a commercial base cutter height control system...|$|R
40|$|The heat {{transfer}} characteristics of turbulent air flow in a multipass channel were studied via the naphthalene sublimation technique. The naphthalene-coated test section, {{consisting of two}} straight, square channels joined by a 180 deg turn, resembled the internal cooling passages of gas turbine airfoils. The {{top and bottom surfaces}} of the test channel were roughened by rib turbulators. The rib height-to-hydraulic diameter ratio (e/D) were 0. 063 and 0. 094, and the rib pitch-to-height ratio (P/e) were 10 and 20. The local heat/mass transfer coefficients on the roughened top wall and on the smooth <b>divider</b> and side <b>walls</b> of the test channel were determined for three Reynolds numbers of 15, 30, and 60, thousand, and for three angles of attack (alpha) of 90, 60, and 45 deg. Results showed that the local Sherwood numbers on the ribbed walls were 1. 5 to 6. 5 times those for a fully developed flow in a smooth square duct. The average ribbed-wall Sherwood numbers were 2. 5 to 3. 5 times higher than the fully developed values, depending on the rib angle of attack and the Reynolds number. The results also indicated that, before the turn, the heat/mass transfer coefficients in the cases of alpha = 60 and 45 deg were higher than those in the case of alpha= 90 deg. However, after the turn, the heat/mass transfer coefficients in the oblique-rib cases were lower than those in the transverse rib case. Correlations for the average Sherwood number ratios for individual channel surfaces and for the overall Sherwood number ratios are reported. Correlations for the fully developed friction factors and for the loss coefficients are also provided...|$|R
40|$|The heat {{transfer}} characteristics of airflows in serpentine cooling channels in stator vanes of gas turbines and the novel QuTech? Heat Pipe (QTHP) for electronic cooling applications were studied. The cooling channels are modeled as smooth and roughened two-pass trapezoidal channels with a 180 ? turn over {{a range of}} Reynolds numbers between about 10, 000 and 60, 000. The naphthalene sublimation technique and the heat and mass transfer analogy were applied. The results showed {{that there was a}} very large variation of the local heat (mass) transfer distribution in the turn and downstream of the turn. The local heat (mass) transfer was high near the end wall and the downstream outer wall in the turn and was relatively low in two regions near the upstream outer wall and the downstream edge {{at the tip of the}} <b>divider</b> <b>wall</b> in the turn. The variation of the local heat (mass) transfer was larger with ribs on two opposite walls than with smooth walls. The regional average heat (mass) transfer was lower in the turn and higher in the entire channel with the flow entering the channel through the larger straight section than when the flow was reversed. The pressure drop across the turn was higher with the flow entering the channel through the larger channel than when the flow was reversed. Thermal performance of the QuTech? Heat Pipe was identified over a range of inclination angles between 90 ? and - 90 ? and thermal mechanism of the QTHP was studied with GC-MS, ICP-OES, XRD, XPS, and DSC. This study resulted in the following findings: the performance of the QTHP was severely dependent on gravity; the QTHP utilizes water as working fluid; there were inorganic components such as Na, K, P, S, and Cr, etc.; and the vaporization temperature of the working fluid (mostly water) was lower than the boiling temperature of pure water. This was due to the presence of inorganic salt hydrates in the QTHP. It may be concluded that thermal performance of heat pipes increases with additional latent heat of fusion energy and energy required to release water molecules from salt hydrates...|$|E
