5|$|By the mid-1980s, synth-pop {{had helped}} {{establish}} the synthesizer {{as a primary}} instrument in mainstream pop music. It also influenced the sound of many mainstream rock acts, such as Bruce Springsteen, ZZ Top and Van Halen. It was {{a major influence on}} house music, which <b>grew</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> post-disco dance club culture of the early 1980s as some DJs attempted to make the less pop-oriented music that also incorporated influences from Latin soul, dub, rap music, and jazz.|$|E
5|$|Tournaments and hastiludes {{began in}} the 11th century as both a sport and to provide {{training}} for battle. Usually taking {{the form of a}} melee, the participants used the horses, armour and weapons of war. The sport of jousting <b>grew</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tournament and, by the 15th century, the art of tilting became quite sophisticated. In the process, the pageantry and specialization became less war-like, perhaps because of the knight's changing role in war.|$|E

5|$|Developed in {{response}} to the American Polaris programme, the Tu-142 <b>grew</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> need for a viable Soviet ASW platform. It succeeded the stillborn Tu-95PLO project, Tupolev's first attempt at modifying the Tu-95 for maritime use. The Tu-142 differed from the Tu-95 in having a stretched fuselage to accommodate specialised equipment for its ASW and surveillance roles, a reinforced undercarriage to support rough-field capability, improved avionics and weapons, and enhancements to general performance. The Tu-142's capability was incrementally improved while the type was in service, eventually resulting in the Tu-142MZ, the final long-range Tu-142 with highly sophisticated combat avionics and a large payload. Tupolev also converted a number of Tu-142s as avionics (Tu-142MP) and engine (Tu-142LL) testbeds.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, the Somali Film Agency (SFA), the nation's film {{regulatory}} body, was established. An {{adjunct to}} the federal Ministry of Information and National Guidance, it <b>grew</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ministry's visual aids arm. The SFA's duties included overseeing the importation, distribution and censorship of movies in the country. It later also oversaw the production of both long and short films. Most of the imported films were brought in from Egypt, Italy, the Soviet Union and East Germany. To facilitate processing and post-production, the SFA also forged a working partnership with British Films LTD, a British movie company. From 1979 to 1983, the Somali film producer and director Ali Said Hassan served as the SFA's representative in Rome.|$|E

Children's World International is the sister charity of Children's World and was started in 1999 to work with children in the Balkans, in conjunction with Balkan Sunflowers and Save the Children. They also run the Glastonbury Children's Festival each August.|$|E

The video game merchandising business Fangamer <b>grew</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Starmen.net community, and sells video game-related items online. A full-length documentary on Starmen.net and the fan community, EarthBound, USA, is in production. While series creator, Shigesato Itoi {{has stated that}} he is finished with the series, a fan-created sequel, Mother 4, began development. However, following several high-profile DMCA takedowns of other fan games, the fan-created game is undergoing rebranding so it {{will no longer be}} part of the Mother series.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary annals {{began to}} be kept in Wessex during the 7th century. The {{material}} compiled in Alfred's reign included annals relating to Kentish, South Saxon, Mercian and, particularly, West Saxon history, but, {{with the exception of the}} Cynewulf entry, does not gather momentum until it comes to the Nordic invasions of the late 8th century onwards. The Chronicle <b>grew</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tradition of the Easter Tables, drawn up to help the clergy determine the dates of feasts in future years: a page consisted of a sequence of horizontal lines followed by astronomical data, with a space for short notes of events to distinguish one year from another. As the Chronicle developed, it lost its list-like appearance, and such notes took up more space, becoming more like historical records. Many later entries, especially those written by contemporaries, contained a great deal of historical narrative under the year headings.|$|E
5|$|The first farming {{people to}} settle {{in the region are}} {{associated}} with the Neolithic Starčevo culture, which flourished between 6200 and 5200 BC. There are several Starčevo sites in and around Belgrade, including the eponymous site of Starčevo. The Starčevo culture was succeeded by the Vinča culture (5500–4500 BC), a more sophisticated farming culture that <b>grew</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earlier Starčevo settlements which is also named for a site in the Belgrade region (Vinča-Belo Brdo). The Vinča culture is known for its very large settlements, one of the earliest settlements by continuous habitation and some of the largest in prehistoric Europe; anthropomorphic figurines such as the Lady of Vinča; the earliest known copper metallurgy in Europe; a proto-writing form developed prior to the Sumerians and Minoans, known as the Old European script, dating back to around 5300 BC.|$|E

5|$|The Whig Party {{was also}} divided in Kentucky, not only between Clay and Taylor, but between gubernatorial candidates. William J. Graves, out of {{politics}} since his fatal shooting of Representative Cilley, had the backing of sitting Whig governor William Owsley, while Archibald Dixon had secured support from former Whig governor Robert P. Letcher. Letcher wrote to Crittenden that a Whig split and Democratic victory in the gubernatorial election would have an injurious effect on Whig hopes of carrying Kentucky in the 1848 presidential election; another former Whig governor, Thomas Metcalfe, concurred. At the Whig nominating convention, both Graves and Dixon withdrew their names and a delegate from Logan County put forward Crittenden's name without his consent. The nomination easily carried before Crittenden's friends could block it. The governorship was less prestigious and paid less than Crittenden's position in the Senate. He {{would also have to}} abandon his growing legal practice before the Supreme Court and would lose input on national issues of importance to him such as the territorial questions that <b>grew</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mexican War. Nevertheless, he believed that his candidacy would unite the Whigs and help Taylor win Kentucky's electoral votes in the general election. He accepted the nomination a week after it was made.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{anthropology}} in the forensic investigation of remains <b>grew</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recognition {{of anthropology}} {{as a distinct}} scientific discipline {{and the growth of}} physical anthropology. The field of anthropology began in the United States and struggled to obtain recognition as a legitimate science {{during the early years of}} the twentieth century. Earnest Hooton pioneered the field of physical anthropology and became the first physical anthropologist to hold a full-time teaching position in the United States. He was an organizing committee member of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists along with its founder Aleš Hrdlička. Hooton's students created some of the first doctoral programs in physical anthropology during the early 20th century. In addition to physical anthropology, Hooton was a proponent of criminal anthropology. Now considered a pseudoscience, criminal anthropologists believed that phrenology and physiognomy could link a person's behavior to specific physical characteristics. The use of criminal anthropology to try to explain certain criminal behaviors arose out of the eugenics movement, popular at the time. It is because of these ideas that skeletal differences were measured in earnest eventually leading to the development of anthropometry and the Bertillon method of skeletal measurement by Alphonse Bertillon. The study of this information helped shape anthropologists' understanding of the human skeleton and the multiple skeletal differences that can occur.|$|E
