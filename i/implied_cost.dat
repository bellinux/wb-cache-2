40|$|The {{just-in-time}} (JIT) concept originates {{from the}} Toyota Production System (TPS) {{and has been}} adopted {{in the construction industry}} for decades to improve logistics and performance. The concept has proven to be effective in reducing in-ventory level, improving information exchange and supply chain performance. Many new benefits of JIT sourcing have been identified in recent years, such as the improvement in environmental performance for contractors. However, these new benefits are challenged by many academics based on the rigorous criteria that should be followed when applying the JIT sourcing concept. It is therefore necessary to re-evaluate the benefits and costs of JIT sourcing, especially to identify what the <b>implied</b> <b>costs</b> are in order to achieve the benefits. This paper aims to take the first step to re-evaluate JIT sourcing for Chinese con-tractors for better implementation. According to the research aim, this paper is split into two parts. The first section focuses on explaining the traditional and new benefits of JIT sourcing while the second section aims to investigate the <b>implied</b> <b>costs</b> of these benefits. By knowing the benefits and <b>implied</b> <b>costs,</b> the contractors can be fully prepared to apply JIT sourcing to improve their performance...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{literature}} {{which has}} examined taxation and <b>implied</b> <b>cost</b> of equity capital has by necessity foucsed on tax paying firms. There are no studies which investigate {{what happens to}} the cost of equity capital when companies change their tax status.

It allows estimation of <b>implied</b> <b>cost</b> of equity capital for UK REITs both pre and post conversion {{to examine the relationship between}} taxation an the cost of equity capital using a significant change in taxation. This study will investigate whether the tax status of REITs has an effect on their <b>implied</b> <b>cost</b> of equity capital, and whether the existing models of <b>implied</b> <b>cost</b> of equity capital can be applied in the UK. These issues were empirically tested using <b>implied</b> <b>cost</b> of equity estimated by four different models.

40|$|Abstract Prior {{research}} documents a weak {{association between}} the <b>implied</b> <b>cost</b> of equity inferred from analyst forecasts and realized returns. It points to predictable errors in analyst forecasts as a possible cause. We show that removing predictable errors from analyst forecasts leads to a much stronger association between <b>implied</b> <b>cost</b> of equity estimates obtained from adjusted forecasts and realized returns after controlling for cash flow news and discount rate news. An estimate of implied risk premium based on the average of four commonly used methods after making adjustments for predictable errors exhibits strong correlations with future realized returns {{as well as the}} lowest measurement error. Overall, our results confirm the validity of <b>implied</b> <b>cost</b> of equity estimates as measures of expected returns.

40|$|Investors {{have strong}} {{incentives}} {{to assess the}} expected return of common equity as an important variable in portfolio management, capital budgeting, investment appraisal and resource allocation decision. A relatively novel methodology of estimating the expected return links market prices with analyst-issued expected cash flows to deduce the <b>implied</b> <b>cost</b> of equity capital. The purpose of this thesis is to evaluate five earnings-based <b>implied</b> <b>cost</b> of capital estimates and to assess the sensitivity of earnings-based <b>implied</b> <b>cost</b> of capital against a number of parameters introduced by alternative equity valuation models and analyst behaviour. The dissertation utilizes a relatively large dataset ofU. K. firms for the period 1994 - 2003. The individual and joint assessment of <b>implied</b> <b>cost</b> of capital estimates bears upon the investigation of several empirical questions. In particular, {{an examination of the}} average magnitude of <b>implied</b> <b>cost</b> of capital estimates measures the degree of mean-point accuracy of these estimates, in relation to expected return. Comparative statistics and a set of (non) parametric tests of independence are used to assess the proximity/departure of the distributions of alternative <b>implied</b> <b>cost</b> of capital estimates. Cases of extreme divergence among the estimates are marked by relative values of ex-ante characteristics and a break-point level of <b>implied</b> <b>cost</b> of capital. The ability of <b>implied</b> <b>cost</b> of capital to characterize cross-sectional variation in expected equity return is evaluated through tests of linear association between <b>implied</b> <b>cost</b> of capital estimates and a number of firm/industry specific risk factors, including-the special cases of Research and Development and Advertising expenditure. Incrementally, the usefulness of <b>implied</b> <b>cost</b> of capital estimates as parsimonious predictors of realized return is assessed, with return predictability tests carried out against various forecasting horizons, at firm and industry levels, across particular clusters of stocks, and under the assumption that a firm's risk premium is a positive function of the market excess return. Finally, the impact of analyst behaviour on the quality of earnings forecasts and, pervasively, on the quality of earnings based <b>implied</b> <b>cost</b> of capital estimates is examined. Several attributes of analyst behaviour are initially identified as sources of analyst bias. These attributes are then quantified with the use of easily measurable proxy variables facilitating the development of an econometric model that predicts analyst forecasting errors, and the consolidation of fitted values of expected errors in the estimation process of' adjusted' <b>implied</b> <b>cost</b> of capital estimates. The variation of <b>implied</b> <b>cost</b> of capital estimates across analyst investment recommendation is hypothesized and tested, and the cases of analyst forecast sluggishness and/or thin trading leading to information mismatch between analyst expectations and market prices are considered. The results of this thesis are of interest to researchers dedicated to the <b>implied</b> <b>cost</b> of capital, the cross-section of expected returns, earnings based equity valuation, model equivalence, analyst earnings forecasts, analyst behaviour, and, to a minor extent, the U. K. aggregated equity risk premium. The tests performed are sufficient in clearly designating the preferred <b>implied</b> <b>cost</b> of capital estimate.

40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} measurement error in analysts’ forecasts on the accuracy of <b>implied</b> <b>cost</b> of capital estimates from various implementations of the ‘implied cost of capital’ approach, and develop corrections for the measurement error. The <b>implied</b> <b>cost</b> of capital approach relies on analysts’ short- and long-term earnings forecasts as proxies for the market’s expectation of future earnings, and solves for the implied discount rate that equates {{the present value of}} the expected future payoffs to the current stock price. We document predictable error in the <b>implied</b> <b>cost</b> of capital estimates resulting from analysts’ forecasts that are sluggish with respect to information in past stock returns. We propose two methods to mitigate the influence of sluggish forecasts on the <b>implied</b> <b>cost</b> of capital estimates. These methods substantially improve the ability of the <b>implied</b> <b>cost</b> of capital estimates to explain cross-sectional variation in future stock returns, which is consistent with the corrections being effective in mitigating the error in the estimates due to analysts’ sluggishness...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the effect on the cost of capital of {{increased}} disclosure that reduces information asymmetry among market participants. Design/methodology/approach – This study uses the decision to regularly hold open (closed) conference calls pre-Reg FD as a proxy for a commitment to the policy of public (selective) disclosure and a cross-sectional research design to examine the associations between open/closed conference calls and three proxies for firms' cost of capital (i. e. bid-ask spreads, share turnover, and <b>implied</b> <b>costs</b> of capital). Findings – The results show that firms that commit to open calls exhibit lower relative bid-ask spreads, lower <b>implied</b> <b>costs</b> of capital, and higher share turnover than firms that commit to closed calls. Practical implications – The findings suggest that increased disclosure that “levels the playing field” for small investors benefits investors as a whole by improving firms' market liquidity and reducing the cost of capital. Originality/value – This study contributes to existing literature on the association between corporate disclosure and firms' cost of capital.

40|$|The paper "Can the <b>implied</b> <b>cost</b> {{of capital}} from a {{mechanical}} earnings forecast model proxy the expected cost of capital" is submitted by LEI Ling for {{the degree of}} Master of Philosophy in Accounting at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in May, 2000. Prior research advocates {{the use of the}} <b>implied</b> <b>cost</b> of capital from the residual income model to proxy the expected cost of capital because of its superiority over average realized returns. This study examines whether this approach can be extended to firms without analyst coverage using a mechanical model of earnings forecast. While the <b>implied</b> <b>cost</b> of capital calculated with AR (2) model concentrates at around 5 - 6 %, it is unreasonably low. The implied risk premium is negative for over half of the sample years and the median implied risk premium across all firm years is - 0. 6 %. In addition, the regression of the implied risk premium on the three commonly identified risk factors results in a negative beta effect, positive size effect, and negative B/P ratio effect, all contrary to intuition. To serve as a benchmark, I repeat the estimation of the <b>implied</b> <b>cost</b> of capital and the regression on the three risk factors with firms followed by analysts. The comparison indicates that the unreasonably low <b>implied</b> <b>cost</b> of capital is due to the pessimism of AR (2) forecast model and the underestimation of the terminal value in the residual income model for some firms. Since pessimism is a common problem of all mechanical earnings forecast models, I conclude that we can not get an <b>implied</b> <b>cost</b> of capital from the residual income model as the reasonable proxy for the expected cost of capital for firms without analyst coverage...|$|E
