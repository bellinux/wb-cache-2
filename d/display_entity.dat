40|$|In {{order to}} support web {{applications}} to understand the content of HTML pages {{an increasing number of}} websites have started to annotate structured data within their pages using markup formats such as Microdata, RDFa, Microformats. The annotations are used by Google, Yahoo!, Yandex, Bing and Facebook to enrich search results and to <b>display</b> <b>entity</b> descriptions within their applications. In this paper, we present a series of publicly accessible Microdata, RDFa, Microformats datasets that we have extracted from three large Web corpora dating 2010, 2012 and 2013. Altogether, the datasets consist of almost 30 billion RDF quads. The most recent of the datasets contains amongst other data over 211 million product descriptions, 54 million reviews and 125 million postal addresses originating from thousands of websites. The availability of the datasets lays the foundation for further research on integrating and cleansing the data as well as for exploring its utility within different application contexts. As the dataset series covers four years, it {{can also be used to}} analyze the evolution of the adoption of the markup formats...|$|E

It is a useful companion to the EXPRESS language for <b>displaying</b> <b>entity</b> and type definitions, relationships and cardinality. This graphical notation supports {{a subset of the}} EXPRESS language. One of the advantages of using EXPRESS-G over EXPRESS is that the structure of a data model can be presented in a more understandable manner. A disadvantage of EXPRESS-G is that complex constraints cannot be formally specified. Figure 1 is an example. The data model presented in figure could be used to specify the requirements of a database for an audio compact disc (CD) collection.|$|R

Entity cards are intended to enhance search experience in several ways: (i) they help searchers navigate diversified results, (ii) provide a summary of relevant content directly on the results page and (iii) support exploratory search by highlighting relevant entities associated with a given user query. We conducted a large-scale crowd-sourced user study, with more than $ 700 $ unique searchers, to investigate the effects of entity cards on search behaviour and perceived workload. We find {{that the presence of}} ECs has a strong effect on both the way users interact with search results and their perceived task workload. Furthermore, by manipulating EC properties content, coherence and vertical diversity), we uncover different effects and interactions between card properties on measures of search behaviour and workload.

5000|$|While {{initially}} for manual data entry, {{these tools}} were then extended with add-on components to allow integration with databases. These database add-ons allowed mapping between a database entities (such as person, place, organisation, vehicle, asset, event) and {{the relationships between}} entities (such as associate, owns, related) and visual entities used to represent those records on the chart (person icon, place icon etc.). The first such database interface was to HOLMES 2 (Home Office Large Major Enquiry System), and subsequently many different SQL and even free text data sources. With database integration a query could be entered from within the visual representation of the data, the chart, either using a context menu on the chart background, or on a <b>displayed</b> <b>entity</b> (usually an icon). Query results were delivered directly to the visualisation, by adding elements to the chart, and any added entities and links were automatically laid out without disturbing {{the rest of the}} chart, for ease of understanding. Investigators could explore a database with an initial search, and then incrementally expand to follow particular lines of thought. For example, by right clicking an person icon, choosing [...] "Expand", and having new <b>entities</b> <b>displayed</b> as icons connected to the queried person, to show relationships drawn directly from the database. Thus revealing associations that would be difficult to spot through a traditional database query UI such as a person record {{that may or may not}} include information about known associates, vehicles, assets and so on, related to that person. This removed the need for any contextual knowledge by the investigator to infer likely relationships, and enabled even a new investigator to quickly explore new data or new hypotheses even with very large data sets.|$|R
40|$|Cancers {{have killed}} {{millions}} of people in human history and are still posing a serious health problem worldwide. Therefore, there is an urgent need for developing preventive and therapeutic cancer vaccines. Among various cancer vaccine development platforms, virus-like particles (VLPs) offer several advantages. VLPs are multimeric nanostructures with morphology resembling that of native viruses and are mainly composed of surface structural proteins of viruses but are devoid of viral genetic materials rendering them neither infective nor replicative. In addition, they can be engineered to display multiple, highly ordered heterologous epitopes or peptides in order to optimize the antigenicity and immunogenicity of the <b>displayed</b> <b>entities.</b> Like native viruses, specific epitopes displayed on VLPs can be taken up, processed, and presented by antigen-presenting cells to elicit potent specific humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. Several studies also indicated that VLPs could overcome the immunosuppressive state of the tumor microenvironment and break self-tolerance to elicit strong cytotoxic lymphocyte activity, which is crucial for both virus clearance and destruction of cancerous cells. Collectively, these unique characteristics of VLPs make them optimal cancer vaccine candidates. This review discusses current progress in the development of VLP-based cancer vaccines and some potential drawbacks of VLPs in cancer vaccine development. Extracellular vesicles with close resembling to viral particles are also discussed and compared with VLPs as a platform in cancer vaccine developments...|$|R

40|$|When {{defining}} a scheme {{of a web}} application, modelers re-peatedly perform modelling tasks like “after having defined an entity type, add a page class for <b>displaying</b> the <b>entity</b> type’s content”. Thereby, a scheme is extended {{again and again in}} a similar manner. It would therefore be convenient for modelers to have transformers that, when applied to a scheme, perform such tasks. In this paper, we present the language TBE (transformers-by-example) which allows defining transformers for WebML schemes by example, i. e. by giving an example of what is desired instead of specifying operations for achieving the re-sult. The notation of transformers is thereby similar to one with which modelers are familiar. Further, each application of a transformer to a scheme can be parameterized such that the corresponding modelling task will be performed only within a specified part of the scheme. This makes it easy for modelers to define and apply transformers. Keywords web modelling, web schema transformers, query templates, generative templates, query by example 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Entities on the Web of Data {{need to have}} labels {{in order}} to be exposable to humans in a {{meaningful}} way. These labels can then be used for exploring the data, i. e., for <b>displaying</b> the <b>entities</b> in a linked data browser or other front-end applications, but also to support keyword-based or natural-language based search over the Web of Data. Far too many applications fall back to exposing the URIs of the entities to the user in the absence of more easily understandable representations such as human-readable labels. In this work we introduce a number of label-related metrics: completeness of the labeling, the efficient accessibility of the labels, unambiguity of labeling, and the multilinguality of the label-ing. We report our findings from measuring the Web of Data using these metrics. We also investigate which properties are used for labeling pur-poses, since many vocabularies define further labeling properties beyond the standard property from RDFS...|$|R

40|$|The most {{important}} technique to visualize 3 D scalar data, as they arise e. g. in medicine from tomographic measurement, is direct volume rendering. A transfer function maps the scalar values to optical properties {{which are used}} to solve the integral of light transport in participating media. Many medical data sets, especially MRI data, however, are difficult to visualize due to different tissue types being represented by the same scalar value. The main problem is that interesting structures will be occluded by less important structures because they share the same range of data values. Occlusion, however, is a view-dependent problem and cannot be solved easily by transfer function design. This paper proposes a new method to <b>display</b> different <b>entities</b> inside the volume data in a single rendering pass. The proposed opacity peeling technique reveals structures in the data set that cannot be visualized directly by one- or multi-dimensional transfer functions without explicit segmentation.
