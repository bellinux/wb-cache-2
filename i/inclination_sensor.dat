40|$|Abstract. Reducing the {{resource}} requirements of various electronic devices is continually being demanded, {{and the research}} and development of miniaturized and highly efficient MEMS devices is being actively pursued. Although, the manufacture of tip-shaped devices is easy using MEMS technology, it is, in general, difficult to manufacture three dimensional structures. A nanofabrication technology aiming at the mass production of three dimensional structures would be a very welcome addition to the range of technologies currently in use. One process which has been attracting attention is a molding process for resins using microstructural molds manufactured using the LIGA process. In this research, we manufactured a capacitive type <b>inclination</b> <b>sensor</b> using this LIGA based process. By using this molding process, the production cost can be kept low compared with the processes used currently for these types of sensors. A silicon mold with a pattern size of 7 × 7 mm 2 and a structure height of 100 µm etched by ICP dry etching was produced. The pattern in the silicon mold was transferred to a resin by hot embossing, and assembled to produce an <b>inclination</b> <b>sensor.</b> Evaluation of the <b>inclination</b> <b>sensor</b> showed it to have good linear performance. We expect that these techniques can be introduced to the low-cost mass-production of other MEMS devices (including sensors), so that the range of applications can be further expanded to new areas of technology and industry...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{observations}} made on {{the engineering}} structures like dams, bridges, viaducts and high buildings provide {{to determine whether the}} structure was built in accordance with the project or not and whether it behaves reliably or not. In the light of this information, new information that should be considered in the assumptions used in the project can be obtained and some parameters can change. The dynamic parameters like wind, temperature, earthquake loads especially acting on the tall buildings cause the structure move in the horizontal direction. A high precision <b>inclination</b> <b>sensor,</b> a GPS site and an anemometer were installed in order to observe the dynamic behaviors of the 30 -storey high Rixos Hotel building in the horizontal direction. The floors of the building are formed from a lobby, a clerestory, 4 basement floors, an equipment floor and 26 floors with hotel rooms. The biaxial inclination sensors namely Leica Nivel 220 were installed at the 21 st and 26 th floors on one of the shear-nucleus. The GPS site was located at a place on the roof from which the satellite view would be maximum and the behavior of the building would be reflected at best, and the Young Anemometer was installed at a most dominating place on the roof in order to measure the velocity and the direction of the wind. The horizontal movements of the building, the velocity and the direction of the wind are still continuously observed using the biaxial <b>inclination</b> <b>sensor</b> and the anemometer. In this paper, there were given information about the installation plan of <b>inclination</b> <b>sensor,</b> anemometer and GPS point that were installed to determine the dynamic behaviors of the building.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{intricate}} branches of metrology involves the monitoring of displacements and deformations of natural and anthropogenic structures under environmental forces, such as tidal or tectonic phenomena, or ground water level changes. Technological progress has changed the measurement process, and steadily increasing accuracy requirements {{have led to the}} continued development of new measuring instruments. The adoption of an appropriate measurement strategy, with proper instruments suited for the characteristics of the observed structure and its environmental conditions, is of high priority in the planning of deformation monitoring processes. This paper describes the use of precise digital <b>inclination</b> <b>sensors</b> in continuous monitoring of structural deformations. The topic is treated from two viewpoints: (i) evaluation of the performance of <b>inclination</b> <b>sensors</b> by comparing them to static and continuous GPS observations in deformation monitoring and (ii) providing a strategy for analyzing the structural deformations. The movements of two case study objects, a tall building and a geodetic monument in Istanbul, were separately monitored using dual-axes micro-radian precision <b>inclination</b> <b>sensors</b> (inclinometers) and GPS. The time series of continuous deformation observations were analyzed using the Least Squares Spectral Analysis Technique (LSSA). Overall, the inclinometers showed good performance for continuous monitoring of structural displacements, even at the sub-millimeter level. Static GPS observations remained insufficient for resolving the deformations to the sub-centimeter level due to the errors that affect GPS signals. With the accuracy advantage of <b>inclination</b> <b>sensors,</b> their use with GPS provides more detailed investigation of deformation phenomena. Using inclinometers and GPS is helpful to be able to identify the components of structural responses to the natural forces as static, quasi-static, or resonant...|$|R

40|$|Wind-induced {{response}} of tall buildings {{consists of three}} components: static, quasi-static and resonant. It is necessary to use different sensors in an integrated manner – GPS, accelerometer, <b>inclination</b> <b>sensor</b> and so on – in order to monitor and identify these three components. There are some differences among these sensors with respect to data sampling rate, data quality, and their measurands. Therefore, using different sensors together for a monitoring project is important because of the unique contributions of each sensor, {{as well as the}} different sensitivities. Although GPS is capable of measuring absolute displacement directly, multipath effects distort the pseudo-range and the carrier phase observations, and hence decrease the data quality in low frequency range. It is not possible to detect static and quasi-static displacement of structures reliably unless the multipath error is removed by an appropriate mitigation algorithm or procedure. <b>Inclination</b> <b>sensor</b> data may compensate for this weakness of GPS caused by multipath.

Steel wire was used as the flexible transmission medium and a group of special wire-locking structures was designed. Additionally, we designed passive joints for partial joints of the exoskeleton. Finally, we proposed a novel gait phase recognition method for full-body exoskeletons using only joint angular sensors, plantar pressure <b>sensors,</b> and <b>inclination</b> <b>sensors.</b> The method consists of four procedures.

40|$|The planes {{occurring}} at convex corners during anisotropic etching of (100) -silicon in aqueous KOH {{were identified as}} (411) -planes {{with the help of}} an especially developed measuring technique. The etching rate of these planes in relation to the rate of the (100) -planes declines with increasing potassium hydroxide concentration. In contrast, the temperature dependence of this etch rate ratio is neglectable in the relevant range between 60 degree C and 100 degree C. Based on these results, special structures suited for the compensation of the undercutting in the case of very narrow contures were developed. With the help of these structures it is feasible to realize, for instance, bent V-grooves or structures with a very low ratio between lateral expansion and etching depth, e. g. a descrete pyramid-trunk with minimum dimensions on the wafer surface.

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) is an efficient, effective, {{and precise}} {{measurement}} tool rapidly growing in popularity {{in a wide}} variety of fields. Use of TLS data often requires aligning multiple scans for a more complete model of a scene or object, a procedure known as scan registration. Each scan setup must be transformed (i. e., rotated, scaled, and translated) and adjusted to match the other setups as closely as possible. This research investigates and compares the traditional least squares method against a rapid, noniterative technique recently proposed and develops possible solutions to achieve the strengths of both methods. Additionally, modern TLS instruments are commonly equipped with an <b>inclination</b> <b>sensor</b> to measure deviations from a level setup in order to simplify the registration process. This thesis investigates the reliability, usefulness, and limitations of these sensors. In particular, the concept of a "stability threshold" that ensures reliable inclination measurements in modern, rapid scanners is introduced and sources of <b>inclination</b> <b>sensor</b> error, and procedures to minimize that error, are investigated. While level and unlevel setups appear to produce consistent results, full 360 ° scan windows measured in both the clockwise and counter-clockwise direction are recommended. Finally, some field applications of TLS reference frame transformations are presented and discussed, including the development of a coordinate system in a large-scale research laboratory and steps toward the development of real-time change detection...|$|E

The same reasoning applies above water: the target is small and partially submerged, and the agitated sea surface acts as a dynamic and noisy background hiding the target among the clutter. In practice, the only reliable detection method so far proved to be a human lookout, which significantly complicated operations since every potential contact had to be carefully approached and identified visually. This experience shows that an automated detection system would be beneficial in similar conflicts, and in cleanup operations of the abandoned mines of old conflicts.|$|R

Taking advantage of line features as basic geometric control conditions instead of control points, the Line-Based Transformation Model (LBTM) provides a practical and efficient way of image rectification. It is competent to build the mathematical relationship between image space and the corresponding object space accurately, while it reduces the workloads of ground control and feature recognition dramatically. Based on generalization and the analysis of existing LBTMs, a novel rigorous LBTM is proposed in this paper, which can further eliminate the geometric deformation caused by <b>sensor</b> <b>inclination</b> and terrain variation. This improved nonlinear LBTM is constructed based on a generalized point strategy and resolved by least squares overall adjustment. Geo-positioning accuracy experiments with IKONOS, GeoEye- 1 and ZiYuan- 3 satellite imagery are performed to compare rigorous LBTM with other relevant line-based and point-based transformation models. Both theoretic analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the rigorous LBTM is more accurate and reliable without adding extra ground control.

Space debris researchers use a variety of radars and optical telescopes to characterize the space debris environment in terms of number, altitude, and <b>inclination</b> distributions. Some <b>sensors,</b> such as phased array radars, are designed to search a large volume of the sky and can be instrumental in detecting new breakups and cataloging and precise tracking of relatively large debris. For smaller debris sizes more sensitivity is needed which can be provided, in part, by large antenna gains. Larger antenna gains, however, produce smaller fields of view. Statistical measurements of the debris environment with less precise orbital parameters result. At higher altitudes, optical telescopes become the more sensitive instrument and present their own measurement difficulties. Space Situational Awareness, or SSA, is concerned with more than the number and orbits of satellites. SSA also seeks to understand such parameters as the function, shape, and composition of operational satellites.

40|$|Tidal flat {{morphology}} is continuously {{shaped by}} hydrodynamic forces, {{resulting in a}} highly dynamic bed surface. The knowledge of short-term bed-level changes is important both for assessing sediment transport processes {{as well as for}} understanding critical ecological processes, such as vegetation recruitment on tidal flats. High frequency bed-level measurements with a high vertical resolution are generally needed for hypothesis testing and numerical model validation. However, conventional manual bed-elevation measurements tend to have a coarse temporal resolution (weeks to months) due to the labor involved. Existing automated methods for continuous monitoring of bed-level changes either lack a high vertical resolution or are very expensive and therefore limited in spatial application. In light of this, we developed a novel instrument called SED (Surface Elevation Dynamics) sensor for continuous monitoring with a high vertical resolution (2 mm). This sensor makes use of light sensitive cells (i. e. phototransistors) and operates stand-alone. The unit cost and the labor in deployments are reduced, facilitating spatial application with a number of units. In this study, a group of SED-sensors is tested on a tidal flat in the Westerschelde Estuary, The Netherlands. The obtained bed-level changes are compared with the data obtained with precise manual measurements using traditional Sedimentation Erosion Bars (SEBs). An excellent agreement between the two methods was obtained, confirming the accuracy and precision of the SED-sensors. Furthermore, to demonstrate how the SED-sensors can be used for measuring short-term bed-level dynamics, two SED-sensors were deployed at two sites with contrasting wave exposure. Daily bed-level changes were obtained including a severe storm event. The difference in observed bed-level dynamics at both sites was statistically explained by their different hydrodynamic conditions. Thus, the stand-alone SED-sensor can be applied to monitor sediment surface dynamics with high vertical and temporal resolution, which provides opportunities to pinpoint morphological responses to various forces in intertidal environment. We expect that this sensor can also be applied in other morphological environments, such as rivers, salt-marsh, beaches and dunes, but the actual applicability remains to be tested. Furthermore, the SED-sensors may also offer opportunities for ground-truthing remote sensing techniques aimed at describing morphological changes. Finally, further improvements in future SED-sensors are discussed, including an <b>inclination</b> and compass <b>sensor,</b> wireless data retrieving function and additional IR-light bar for measurements with poor light availabilities...|$|R

40|$|This Master's thesis {{presents}} {{a method for}} on-line estimation of vehicle mass and road grade using Kalman filter. Many control strategies aiming for better fuel economy, drivability and safety in today's vehicles rely on precise vehicle operating information. In this context, vehicle mass and road grade are crucial parameters. The method {{is based on an}} extended Kalman filter (EKF) and a longitudinal vehicle model. The main advantage of this method is its applicability on drivelines with continuous power output during gear shifts and cost effectiveness compared to hardware solutions. The performance has been tested on both simulated data and on real measurement data, collected with a truck on road. Two estimators were developed; one estimates both vehicle mass and road grade and the other estimates only vehicle mass using an <b>inclination</b> <b>sensor</b> as an additional measurement. Tests of the former estimator demonstrate that a reliable mass estimate with less than 5 % error is often achievable within 5 minutes of driving. Furthermore, the root mean square error of the grade estimate is often within 0. 5 °. Tests of the latter estimator show that this is more accurate and robust than the former estimator with a mass error often within 2 %. A sensitivity analysis shows that the former estimator is fairly robust towards minor modelling errors. Also, an observability analysis shows under which circumstances simultaneous vehicle mass and road grade is possible...|$|E
40|$|A topically {{problem with}} VGTVs is {{to control the}} balance. Indeed, the control of this CoG {{can be a real}} asset to {{overcome}} obstacles and a model of the robot is essential. In this section, two model are used to compute two balance criterion a static one (CoG with geometric model) and a dynamic one (ZMP with the dynamic model). 1 Geometric model The geometric model is used to define the robot’s relative position in a general frame. Thus, it is possible to formulate the CoG in terms of the elements and position of the UGV (the tracks ’ weight is negligible in regard to the robot’s weight). First the robot shape has to be decomposed as it is shown on Fig. 2. Joints 1 to 6 describe the position and the orientation of the robot in the environment. Joints 7 and 8 represent the two actuated joints. 1. 1 Denavit & Hartenberg description From the Fig. 2, the Denavit & Hartenberg (DH) formulation allows the computation of several parameters (table 1) which are used to compute transport matrix in order to formulate the coordinates of a point in any frame of the model described by the vector q of the 8 joints variables: q = [q 1,q 2,q 3,q 4,q 5,q 6,q 7,q 8]T where qi represents the articular value of the ith joint. For practical purposes the position (q 1, q 2 and q 3) is computed thanks to a GPS, the orientation (q 4) by using a compass, the ground shape (q 5 and q 6) by using an <b>inclination</b> <b>sensor</b> and the two last parameters (q 7 and q 8) are given by the motors 3 and 4 encoders values. Thanks to these parameters, it is possible to formulate the position of the CoG of each segment in the frame R 0 whatever the position of the different elements of the robot...|$|E
40|$|DE 19825298 A UPAB: 20000209 NOVELTY - A sensor {{structure}} has light detectors for detecting light passage through openings in a structured semiconductor layer. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A sensor structure for measuring acceleration or related parameters has a seismic mass which is structured in a semiconductor layer (1) on a substrate (2) {{and which is}} moved by force or acceleration, {{the combination of the}} semiconductor layer and the seismic mass having openings perpendicular to the plane of the acceleration. The novelty is that light detectors are provided on the substrate for detecting light which passes perpendicular to the acceleration plane through the openings. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for production of the above sensor structure. Preferred Features: The substrate is a silicon substrate and the semiconductor layer consists of single crystal silicon. Each light detector (3) is an electronic device integrated in the substrate and has a light sensitive region with an impedance which varies in accordance with the incident light. The openings form a stripe structure and have an aspect (height/width) ratio of greater than 3. The semiconductor layer is formed by wafer bonding of a second substrate. The seismic mass is designed such that the light detectors emit a maximum or minimum signal. A deflection limiting element is provided for limiting the maximum deflection of the seismic mass and comprises a bending beam which allows two-stage deflection limiting. USE - Especially as an acceleration sensor, <b>inclination</b> <b>sensor,</b> vibration sensor or rotational speed sensor useful in automobiles, robotics, medicine, measurement and control or machine construction. ADVANTAGE - Since the seismic mass is made of semiconductor material, the light passage openings, the seismic mass and its micromechanical mobile suspension can be produced by the same semiconductor etching processes. Additionally, since the substrate also consists of semiconductor material, the sensor can be produced by simplified micromechanical and semiconductor technology and has less weight than conventional sensors...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{established}} {{a method to}} calculate inclination angle of moving vehicles from acceleration and angular velocity measured by microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) sensor, which is becoming popular recently due to its ultra–small size and low manufacturing cost. We applied the technique to measure inclination angle of semi–crawler tractor to validate its usefulness. Results from various methods to calculate inclination angle of a vehicle from acceleration and angular velocity data showed that moving average acceleration method and wavelet acceleration method produced results that significantly deviated from the actual inclination angle, while results from angular velocity method and acceleration–angular velocity method were close to the actual inclination angle. Inclination angle calculated by acceleration method in a static state was {{very similar to the}} measurement from <b>inclination</b> <b>sensor</b> and was highly accurate, but did not demonstrate sufficient accuracy in dynamic state as the estimated inclination angle was at maximum 10 ˚ smaller at inclination angle of 75 ˚. In the meanwhile, the inclination angle calculated by angular velocity method showed only small deviation from the sensor measurement even at dynamic state. As a result of measuring inclination of semi–crawler type tractor using MEMS sensor, it was determined that the angular velocity method is the most versatile of the four methods tested as it can not only produce very accurate time series of inclination angle but also be used to easily obtain angular displacement from the angular velocity data obtained. However, error of integration was shown to increase with longer measurement times and it must be addressed by an appropriate solution. Acceleration–angular velocity method also produced similar results as experiments were performed indoors where disturbance factors were few. The inclination angle measurement system using MEMS sensor established in this study can be applied to agricultural vehicles such as tractors as well as to almost all construction and general vehicles with drive system. We expect the system to contribute to development of a safety system that can prevent rollover accidents and quickly respond to them...|$|E
