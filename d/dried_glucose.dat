40|$|Fourier {{transform}} infrared microspectroscopy (FTIR) {{was used}} to study glasses of pure carbohydrates and in the cytoplasm of desiccation tolerant plant organs. The position of the OH stretching vibration band (vOH) shifted with temperature. Two linear regression lines were observed in vOH against temperature plots. The temperature {{at the point of}} intersection between these two lines coincided with the glass transition temperature (T(g)), as determined by other methods. The temperature at the intersection point decreased with increasing water content, which further validates that, indeed, T(g) was observed. T(g) values that were determined for <b>dry</b> <b>glucose,</b> sucrose, maltose, trehalose and raffinose glasses were 27, 57, 91, 108 and 108 °C, respectively. The shift of vOH with temperature, the wavenumber-temperature coefficient (WTC), was higher in sugar glasses having higher T(g). This suggests that glasses are more loosely packed when they have higher T(g). For Typha latifolia pollen and dried Craterostigma plantagineum leaves we obtained similar vOH vs. temperature plots as for carbohydrate glasses, indicating that a glass transition was observed. The T(g) in dry pollen was ca. 45 °C and in dry plant leaves ca. 65 °C, with WTC values comparable to those observed in the carbohydrates. The T(g) values in these tissues decreased with increasing water contents. Our data suggest that the carbohydrates that are present in the cytoplasm are primary factors contributing to the glassy state.

40|$|The {{conformation}} of hydrated and air-dried poly-L-lysine in {{thin films}} was studied using Fourier transform IR spectroscopy in the amide-I region. Hydrated poly-L-lysine has a random coil conformation. Upon slow drying of small droplets of the polypeptide solution {{over a period}} of several hours, an extended beta-sheet conformation is adopted. This conformational transition can be prevented by fast air-drying within 2 - 3 min. Slow air-drying in the presence of sucrose also preserves the aqueous conformation and results in the formation of a glassy state. Comparison of shifts of the OH band with temperature indicates that sucrose/poly-L-lysine mixtures form a molecularly more densely packed glassy matrix, having a higher glass transition temperature (Tg), than sucrose alone. Whether direct interaction of sugar and polypeptide or glass formation is involved in the stabilization during slow air-drying was studied by drying in the presence of glucose or dextran. Compared with dextran (and sucrose to a lesser extent), glucose gives superior protection. <b>Dried</b> <b>glucose</b> has the lowest Tg and the best interacting properties. We conclude that either immobilization by fast air-drying or sufficient interaction with a protectant through hydrogen bonding (slow drying) plays the leading role in the preservation of the aqueous protein structure...|$|E

A short-term gavage study (0 – 12 h) with fish oil and Cas-Glu-DGS- 50 demonstrated the appearance of fish oil long chain (LC) n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) into the plasma indicating specific small intestinal absorption with little LC n- 3 PUFA reaching the large bowel. In a 2 -week-long term, daily gavage study, the bioavailability of fish oil and fish oil in Cas-Glu-DGS- 50 or Cas-Hylon- 25 demonstrated that fish oil and Cas-Glu-DGS- 50 LC n- 3 PUFA were incorporated into the tissue of the small intestine and colon, whereas Cas-Hylon- 25 was resistant to degradation in the small intestine.

40|$|Enzymatic {{saccharification}} of non-food biomass, such as lignocellulose, {{can produce}} sugars. Sugars are the common feedstock for bioethanol, {{which can be}} substituted for transportation fuel and address the shortage of fossil fuels. Traditional batch enzymatic saccharification usually wastes enzymes. An approach is countercurrent saccharification, which can make full use of enzymes and therefore reduce the enzyme loadings and {{lower the cost of}} sugar and biofuel production. In this research, various types of enzymes, enzyme loadings, and pretreatments for corn stover have been studied in batch hydrolysis to determine the preferred reaction conditions for countercurrent saccharification. Based on the results, cellulase CTec 3 shows better enzymatic saccharification performance than CTec 2 for both raw and pretreated corn stover. For a given enzyme dose, lime pretreatment improves enzymatic digestibility of corn stover significantly. Shock treatment of lime-treated corn stover further increases substrate digestibility. At a CTec 3 dose of 10 mg protein/g <b>dry</b> biomass, the <b>glucose</b> yield of lime + shock treated corn stover is close to 100 %. In contrast, lime pretreated corn stover yields 85 %, and raw corn stover yields only 25 %. For lime + shock treated corn stover, adding additional HTec 3 (1 mg protein/g dry biomass) improved both glucose and xylose yields nearly 30 % compared to CTec 3 (1 mg protein/g dry biomass). The effect of production inhibition on enzyme activity was also tested. When 80 g/L glucose was initially added, glucose and xylose yields decrease 20 % and 5 %, respectively. Countercurrent saccharification of lime + shock treated corn stover with enzyme CTec 3 (1 mg protein/g dry biomass) and CTec 3 (1 mg protein/g dry biomass) + HTec 3 (1 mg protein/g dry biomass) was studied. When the systems reached steady state, the Slope Method was used to determine product yields and verify that steady state was achieved. For CTec 3 (1 mg protein/g <b>dry</b> biomass), the <b>glucose</b> and xylose yields were 64 % and 39 %, respectively. For CTec 3 (1 mg protein/g dry biomass) + HTec 3 (1 mg protein/g <b>dry</b> biomass), <b>glucose</b> and xylose yields were 72 % and 62 %, respectively. To reach a given glucose yield (64 %), when only adding CTec 3, countercurrent saccharification saves nearly 50 % of the enzyme loading compared with batch saccharification.

The protective effect of phosphate was tested using both glucose (low Tg) and sucrose (high Tg) by measuring leakage of carboxyfluorescein (CF), which was incorporated inside the vesicles. Liposomes that were <b>dried</b> with <b>glucose</b> or phosphate alone showed complete leakage after rehydration. However, approximately 30 % CF-retention was obtained using mixtures of phosphate and glucose. Approximately 75 % CF-retention was observed with liposomes that were dried with sucrose.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy studies showed that phosphate and sugars form a strong hydrogen bonding network, which dramatically increased the Tg. The HPO 42 − form of phosphate was found to interact stronger with sugars than the H 2 PO 4 − form. The increased solute retention of liposomes dried in the sugar phosphate mixtures did not coincide with improved storage stability.

Serum from 10 healthy subjects and 10 diabetic participants, who had fasted overnight, were obtained every 30 – 60 minutes during the 3 hours of continued fasting and during the 3 hours after ingestion of 75 [*]g of glucose with or without ingestion of 125 or 250 [*]g of Tinospora crispa <b>dry</b> powder capsule. <b>Glucose</b> and Insulin levels were analyzed and the areas under the curve for mean serum glucose and insulin levels were calculated. Result. The areas under the curve of mean serum glucose and insulin levels in both healthy and diabetic participants were not significantly different between with or without Tinospora crispa dry powder capsule. In diabetic participants the area under the curve of glucose was slightly lesser when 250 [*]mg of Tinospora crispa was ingested, but not reaching statistical significance (478 and 444 [*]mg min/ml, resp., P = 0. 57).

40|$|This work introduces, for {{the first}} time worldwide, the means to {{preserve}} and protect the natural nanoporous structure of the never-dried plant cell wall, against the irreversible collapse, which occurs due to drying. Simultaneously, these means, used for the above-mentioned aim, provide a gateway to novel nanocomposite materials, which retain the super reactive and super absorbent properties of the never-dried biological cellulose fibers. The present work showed, {{for the first}} time worldwide, that glucose can be vaccinated into the cell wall micropores or nanostructure of the never-dried biological cellulose fibers, by simple new techniques, to create a reactive novel nanocomposite material possessing surprising super absorbent properties. Inoculation of the never dried biological cellulose fibers, with glucose, prevented the collapse of the cell wall nanostructure, which normally occurs due to drying. The nanocomposite, produced after <b>drying</b> of the <b>glucose</b> inoculated biological cellulose, retained the super absorbent properties of the never dried biological cellulose fibers. It was found that glucose under certain circumstances grafts to the never dried biological cellulose fibers to form a novel natural nanocomposite material. About 3 - 8 % (w/w) glucose remained grafted in the novel nanocomposite...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} effort {{was to investigate the}} role of various sugar substrates in the growth medium upon thermotolerance and upon survival during storage after freeze-drying of Lactobacillus bulgaricus. Addition of the sugars tested to the growth medium, and of these and sorbitol to the drying medium (skim milk) was investigated so as to determine whether a relationship exists between growth and drying media, in terms of protection of freeze-dried cells throughout storage. The lowest decrease in viability of L. bulgaricus cells after freeze-drying was obtained when that organism was grown in the presence of mannose. However, L. bulgaricus clearly survived better during storage when cells had been grown in the presence of fructose, lactose or mannose rather than glucose (the standard sugar in the growth medium). A similar effect could not be observed in terms of thermotolerance; in this case, the growth medium supplemented with lactose was found to yield cells bearing the highest heat resistance. Supplementation of the <b>drying</b> medium with <b>glucose,</b> fructose, lactose, mannose or sorbitol led in most cases to enhancement of protection during storage, to a degree that was growth medium-dependent...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Arachidonic acid is an {{important}} essential fatty acid in human nutrition. The ﬁlamentous fungus Mortierella alpina {{has been identified as}} a promising producer of arachidonic acid. Mortierella alpine can accumulate up to 40 % (w/w) lipid, of which up to 40 % can be arachidonic acid. Materials and methods: Mortierella alpina CBS 754. 68 was cultivated in low cost substrate such as glucose syrup, brown sugar and starch for lipid and arachidonic acid production. The reduced sugar, total lipids and content of ARA were determined by dinitrosalicylic acid method, soxhlet and Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) respectively. Results: The carbon sources were applied at 70 g/l and nitrogen source (soybean powder) at 10 g/lit. The results showed that lipid in <b>dry</b> biomass in <b>glucose</b> syrup, starch and brown sugar media were obtained 32, 25 and 13 % w/w respectively. The arachidonic acid contents of lipid in the glucose syrup, starch and brown sugar media were 41, 33 and 31 % w/w respectively. Discussion and conclusion: Lipid fatty acid compositions are affected by the growth of microorganism. Cell membrane fatty acids such as stearic acid and oleic acid increased substantially concomitant with increases in the amount of biomass. Biomass and oil production efficiency fell due to inappropriate brown sugar medium...|$|R

40|$|The osmotic {{phenotype}} of Neurospora crassa {{is characterized}} by inhibition of growth at high osmolalities of growth medium. Mutations at six osmotic loci of linkage group I were examined to assess the biochemical and physiological effects of these mutants. Isolated cell walls from 23 osmotic strains were compared with the wild type with regard to quantitative levels of the following components: percentage of total <b>dry</b> weight, total <b>glucose,</b> alkali-soluble glucose, nonglucose carbohydrates, amino acids, glucosamine, galactosamine, and a compound tentatively identified as quinovosamine. The last component has not previously been observed in N. crassa cell walls. Although the cell wall dry weight content of osmotic mutants was not altered, walls isolated {{from all of the}} osmotic strains had less alkali-insoluble glucose than those from the wild type. In addition, all of the loci except cut exhibited other consistent differences from the wild type. The os- 1, os- 3, and os- 5 mutants had low levels of alkali-soluble glucose. The os- 3 and os- 5 mutants had high levels of nonglucose carbohydrates, and flm- 2 had a low level of nonglucose carbohydrates. The os- 4 mutants had low levels of galactosamine and amino acids and high levels alkali-soluble glucose. An os- 1 mutant, B 135, produced less of the whole alkali-soluble fraction of the cell wall...|$|R

The purpose was to study {{the relationship between the}} botanical origin and chemical composition of bee-collected pollen. The amount of mineral elements present in bee-collected pollen was also studied. The composition of pollen loads showed the maximum contents of <b>dry</b> matter, ash, <b>glucose,</b> fructose, magnesium (Mg), phosphorus (P), and manganese (Mn) for the date palm; the maximum contents of protein, calcium (Ca), and zinc (Zn) for alfalfa; the maximum contents of fiber, and copper (Cu) for the sunflower; the maximum contents of the lipids and iron (Fe) for summer squash; and the maximum contents of sodium (Na), and potassium (K) for rape. Calcium was found to be correlated in a significantly (p< 0. 01) positive way with K, Na, Mg, P, Mn, and Zn. Copper, though, was correlated in a significantly (p< 0. 01) negative way with Ca, Mg, P, Mn, and Zn. The high levels of protein, ash, glucose, and fructose, and low lipid content found in bee-pollen from the date palm and from alfalfa, mean that pollen from the date palm and from alfalfa make an excellent food supplement. It was concluded, that the chemical composition of beecollected pollen can be correlated with the plant species from which pollen was collected...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{response}} to variation in food availability and ambient temperature(Ta), many animals show seasonal adaptations in their physiology. Laboratory {{studies showed that}} thyroid hormones are involved in theregulation of metabolism, and their regulatory function is especiallyimportant when the energy balance of an individual is compromised. However, {{little is known about}} the relationship between thyroidhormones and metabolism in free-living animals and animalsinhabiting seasonal environments. Here, we studied seasonalchanges in triiodothyronine (T 3) levels, resting metabolic rate(RMR) and two physiological markers of energy balance (bloodglucose and ketone bodies) in 61 free-living African striped mice(Rhabdomys pumilio) that live in an semi-arid environment with foodshortage during the dry season. We predicted a positive relationshipbetween T 3 levels and RMR. Further, we predicted higher T 3 levels,blood glucose levels and RMR, but lower ketone bodyconcentrations, during the moist season when food availability ishigh compared with summer when food availability is low. RMR andT 3 levels were negatively related in the moist season but not in the dryseason. Both RMR and T 3 levels were higher in the moist than in thedry season, and T 3 levels increased with increasing food availability. In the <b>dry</b> season, blood <b>glucose</b> levels were lower but ketone bodyconcentrations were higher, indicating a change in substrate use. Seasonal adjustments in RMR and T 3 levels permit a reduction ofenergy expenditure when food is scarce, and reflect an adaptive{{response to}} reduced food availability in the dry season...|$|R
40|$|Bio-based {{products}} {{are considered to}} be a sustainable alternative to conventional fossil fuel-based materials. This paper studies the production of glucose from corn starch, an important feedstock {{for a wide range of}} bio-based products (e. g. ethanol, bio-based monomers), in a European corn wet mill (CWM). Following the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) principles, non-renewable energy use (NREU) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are assessed for the system cradle-to-factory gate. The allocation problem that the analysis is faced with is addressed by applying seven different approaches: namely sub-division (two variants), partitioning based on physical causalities and on economic relationships and the principles of system expansion (three variants). Depending on the approach, the NREU for glucose production ranges from 6. 8 to 9. 3 MJ/kg <b>glucose</b> <b>dry</b> solids (ds) and the GHG emissions from 0. 7 to 1. 1 kg CO 2 eq. /kg glucose ds. The results for NREU per tonne of glucose are robust while for GHG, large deviation from the average is found for system expansion and for the approach main process. The influence of each calculation should be kept in mind when assessing bio-based products from glucose produced in a CWM. The results provide a good basis for future analyses of bio-based products, as they are also similar to values published by other authors for the US, bearing in mind the different impacts of corn production in the two regions...|$|R
