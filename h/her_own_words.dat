25|$|In 2002, {{journalist}} Sue Russell wrote a {{book about}} Wuornos called Lethal Intent. In 2012, Lisa Kester and Daphne Gottlieb edited and published a collection of letters written over a ten-year span from Wuornos to Botkins. The book is titled: Dear Dawn: Aileen Wuornos in <b>Her</b> <b>Own</b> <b>Words.</b>|$|E

5000|$|With {{respect to}} religion, {{there is little}} {{indication}} that Kingsley was raised Christian; instead, she was a self-proclaimed believer with, [...] "summed up in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>word</b> ... 'an utter faith in God'" [...] and even identified strongly with what was described as 'the' African religion'. She is known for criticizing Christian missionaries and their work for taking away African culture without proving any real benefits in return.|$|R
25|$|Ophelia, in Paul Griffiths' novel let me {{tell you}} (2008), is a {{derivative}} of Shakespeare's character who tells her story in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>words,</b> in the literal sense that she can use only the words she is given in the play. She speaks of her childhood, of her parents and brother, of Hamlet, and of events leading up to {{the point at which the}} play begins.|$|E
25|$|January 1900 {{began with}} a longer version, and more in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>words,</b> of the ghost story in Ford's home - and carried in the New York Tribune. A {{little more than a}} week later Ford gave a talk on Bret Harte for the Arché club. In a couple days she shared a stage with another speaker on the Fabian Society, and another on Bret Harte.|$|E
25|$|While Henry sulks at the Bethesda {{fountain}} with Violet, Gold takes Regina to {{find someone}} who he claims still has magic. Emma reminds Henry of their time in New York, telling him that he can still wish away his problems and toss a coin into the fountain; she reflects on the irony of <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>words</b> as she had wished to fill the void she felt in their family, which lead to Hook showing up with the memory potion. Elsewhere, Gold leads Regina into a shop, where they meet The Dragon (who survived Tamara's attack on him). Though he refuses to help someone evil as Gold, the Dragon agrees to help Regina, who is fighting her dark side. Emma, Henry, Violet, Gold and Regina watch the Dragon create a small view of where their family is; however, the Dragon fails to open a portal as his magic is not enough. He tells them that despite being called the Land Without Magic, it does exist in the Real World; however, it has become harder to tap into because of neglect.|$|E

2500|$|When Hunt {{came to live}} in Europe {{she found}} that people there called her an American, not an African American or Black. She herself {{describes}} her skin color as [...] "oak {{with a hint of}} maple", and notes that [...] "f the various races I know I comprise—African, American Indian, German Jew and Irish—only the African was acknowledged." [...] Hunt invented <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>word</b> to describe herself, based on the French word melange (mixture) and the word melanin: Melangian.|$|R
25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Sutherland's voice started to decline and her vibrato {{loosened}} to an intrusive extent. However, {{thanks to her}} vocal agility and solid technique, she continued singing the most difficult roles amazingly well. As her vocal security to some extent lessened, paradoxically her dramatic grasp of the theatrical moment heightened. During the 1980s, she added Anna Bolena, Amalia in I masnadieri, and Adriana Lecouvreur to her repertoire, and repeated Esclarmonde at the Royal Opera House performances in November and December 1983. Her last full-length dramatic performance was as Marguerite de Valois (Les Huguenots) at the Sydney Opera House in 1990, {{at the age of}} 63, where she sang Home Sweet Home for her encore. Her last public appearance, however, took place in a gala performance of Die Fledermaus on New Year's Eve, 1990, at Covent Garden, where she was accompanied by her colleagues Luciano Pavarotti and the mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne. According to <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>words,</b> given in an interview with The Guardian newspaper in 2002, her biggest achievement was to sing the title role in Esclarmonde. She considered those performances and recordings her best.|$|E

6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} I am {{afraid to take}} the {{punishment}} for my own follies?" [...] I asked indignantly. [...] "If I believed that, I would go and give myself up to-morrow. Louis can give me away if he will, or you. I don't care a snap of the fingers. But what I {{want you to understand}} is this. Felicia is, I presume, your niece. I should have been inclined to have doubted it, but I cannot disbelieve <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>word.</b> I think myself that it is brutal to have brought such a child here and to have left her alone--" ...|$|R
60|$|But {{he laughed}} and had no answer for <b>her.</b> At <b>her</b> <b>own</b> daring <b>words</b> Carley's heart had leaped to her lips. If he had responded, even teasingly, she could have burst out with her longing to take him back. But silence {{inhibited}} her, and the moment passed.|$|R
500|$|In {{addition}} to poetry, [...] she {{is credited with}} two short writings, Mantrogopya and Yogangatrividhi, the latter written in the native tripadi metre, describing the various stages of spiritual enlightenment. Tradition has it that Akka Mahadevi preferred to wear no clothes, a form of renunciation which in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>words</b> was the [...] "most exalted spiritual state". She died while still in her twenties in a plantain grove in the holy city of Srisailam. A poem by Akka Mahadevi: ...|$|E
500|$|No {{reliable}} {{portrait of}} Sappho's physical appearance has survived; all extant representations, ancient and modern, are artists' conceptions. Ancient tradition held that Sappho's appearance was [...] "small and dark". [...] This description {{may have come}} from <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>words,</b> and it may be significant that this description does not conform to the archaic Greek ideal of female beauty. [...] Alcaeus describes Sappho as [...] "violet-haired", which was a common Greek poetic way of describing dark hair. Some scholars dismiss this tradition as unreliable.|$|E
500|$|Reggie was relentlessly gregarious, and {{throughout}} his life his warmth, wit and friendliness earned him many friends and drinking companions. In contrast, Manning was reticent and uncomfortable in social settings, and remained in the background. She acted, in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>words,</b> as a [...] "camp-follower", trailing after Reggie as he went from bar to bar, often choosing to go home early and alone. While Manning remained faithful to Reggie during the war, their friend Ivor Porter was to report that Reggie had numerous affairs.|$|E
6000|$|... "Alas, no!" [...] sighed their conductor. [...] "Round and round. Round and round. These are <b>Her</b> Radiancy's <b>own</b> <b>words.</b> But oh, agony!

6000|$|He spoke gravely {{and as if}} responsibly--since he had to pronounce; and {{the effect}} of it was {{slightly}} solemn, so that she simply exclaimed [...] "Oh!"

500|$|Her own {{description}} of her music is [...] "Hollywood sadcore". In <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>words,</b> Del Rey described {{most of her}} songs being like [...] "a dark love story seen through hopeful eyes." [...] Tim Lee of musicOMH noted the songs are extremely similar, commenting that [...] "her (alleged) agents clearly having stumbled upon a formula with which they can (allegedly) print money and (allegedly) further consign Lana's secretive, (allegedly) real debut LP to the annals of history. You didn't hear it from us, right?" [...] Del Rey has once described herself as a [...] "gangsta Nancy Sinatra", though she cites Britney Spears, Elvis Presley, and Kurt Cobain as her musical influences.|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of her seventh studio album Ray of Light (1998), Madonna stated in a live {{interview}} with Larry King on January 19, 1999 that [...] "I {{am going to do}} a movie in April; The Next Best Thing, and then I am going to rehearse to go on tour. And then I'll probably play up until the millennium, New Year's Eve." [...] The tour was delayed until 2001, as she had, in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>words,</b> [...] "been distracted by having children and filming movies". She also began a serious relationship with Guy Ritchie in 1999. By 2000, she had become pregnant with her son Rocco Ritchie, released her eighth studio album Music that year, and married Ritchie in December 2000.|$|E

Brown has told Decca Aitkenhead of The Guardian in 2009 that she was wary of joining a soap opera as she had seen EastEnders once on television, [...] "and there was an argument going on, and I thought, 'Oh, I don't want to watch all that,' so I switched it off. I didn't watch it again until I was asked to be in it." [...] The role was extended and the character {{has become one of the}} longest-running to have featured in EastEnders.|$|E
40|$|Writer-director Terrence Malick {{makes the}} {{character}} of Pocahontas in The New World (2005) deliver several lines from Sappho as <b>her</b> <b>own</b> thoughts and <b>words.</b> These quotations, in conjunction with allusions to Vergil and other sources, open narrative directions that enable Pocahontas to emerge within a film that begins as an epic of European exploration with her as the adventurer's love interest as the film's protagonist in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> right. Sappho's <b>words</b> serve to imbue Pocahontas' experience of passion and loss [...] otherwise reminiscent of the abandoned women of epic [...] with the validating authority of Sappho's lyric voice...|$|R

500|$|Paige {{has gained}} herself a {{reputation}} as someone who can be [...] "difficult". [...] The Times Brian Logan wrote, [...] "Paige is not exactly known for her humility. In newspaper profiles, that dread word 'difficult' is often applied". On one occasion, she told a male interviewer {{that she was going}} to stop giving interviews to female reporters because, in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>words,</b> [...] "I don't trust other women in these situations. They establish a sisterhood with you and then betray it every time". What has been seen as a cold side to her personality was also noted by Logan, but Paige has said that a common misconception of her is that she is confident and very serious. [...] Another editor found her [...] "refreshingly down-to-earth" [...] and [...] "very friendly".|$|E
500|$|In a much-publicized move, Clinton {{donned a}} New York Yankees {{baseball}} cap at a June 1999 event {{when she had}} been a lifelong fan of the Chicago Cubs. This brought her much criticism, and Thomas Kuiper would later write an anti-Clinton book titled: I've Always Been a Yankees Fan: Hillary Clinton in <b>Her</b> <b>Own</b> <b>Words.</b> [...] Clinton said she had to develop an American League rooting interest, since fans of the Cubs were not expected to root for the American League Chicago White Sox. [...] In her 2003 autobiography, she said that putting on the hat had been a [...] "bad move", but reiterated what had been reported in the press prior to the incident, that she had been [...] "a die-hard Mickey Mantle fan;" [...] the book included a photograph of her with a Yankees cap on from 1992.|$|E
500|$|Constantine {{originally}} did {{a year of}} Montessori training {{after she}} had left school but she then moved onto other projects such as studying sculpture in Brussels. She later said of this time that she [...] "lost [...] virginity, went a bit mad." [...] Constantine had taught children for three years, and also worked as a shop girl for Harrods. She found the job, in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>words,</b> [...] "boring" [...] and even tried shoplifting {{for the sake of}} excitement, but she has since expressed admiration for shop girls. Constantine's love for horses had inspired her to become a mounted policewoman in London, but was deterred when she found she was required to do four years walking the beat. She wrote a book about present giving, which prompted The Daily Telegraph to write a hostile article implying she had never done a day's work in her life, something which deeply upset her. She has stated defiantly [...] "I've always worked." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stand there. I {{like to look}} at you," [...] she said, {{speaking}} with a spiteful relish of <b>her</b> <b>own</b> cruel <b>words.</b> [...] "It's no use fainting this time.

You can't escape me now!" ...|$|R
30|$|In {{comparison}} to rural migrant women, educated young professional women {{are much less}} susceptible to this marketised idea of romance, even though they seem more desirous of obtaining it. Shen, the bank clerk in Nanjing quoted earlier, may have been blasé about bridal photography (she booked hers online), but she was serious about {{the purchase of a}} diamond ring and told her fiancé that this would be absolutely essential. Rather than waiting for her fiancé to surprise her 1  day, as depicted in the ads, she enlisted him into investing quite a few weekends with her, trekking between many jewellery shops in Nanjing, before finally settling on her ring of choice: a half-carat diamond engagement ring costing 20, 000 yuan. But prior to these shopping expeditions, Shen had spent hours browsing online, ‘doing homework’, in <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>word,</b> looking at countless images of diamond rings, searching for one which meets her criteria in terms of style and price range.|$|R
40|$|Carol Ann Duffy's poem "Penelope" [...] . is {{just one}} example of a long {{tradition}} of receptions of Penelope, stretching from Homer to the present day. Although this chapter cannot provide a detailed account of this reception history, it is useful to be aware of how regularly Penelope has been thrust centre-stage and given a voice.
