25|$|In {{an attempt}} to regain their pre-war status at the {{forefront}} of the avant-garde, and faced with the possibility of being overthrown by Dada, the cubists regrouped. Their first chance to exhibit together presented itself at the Salon des Indépendants of 1920. But the fight wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy.</b> Opening on 28 January, over three thousand works were display, a large number of which were Cubist paintings. For the first time the exhibition took place at the Grand Palais des Champs-Elysées. Picasso was nowhere to be seen, but others were, such as Archipenko, Braque, Csaky, Gleizes, Gris, Hayden, Herbin, Léger, Lhote, Lipchitz, Metzinger, Severini and Survage.|$|E
25|$|Format in {{this tournament}} was {{same as the}} first one: four groups of three, then two groups of four in quarter-finals; top two into semi-finals. This {{competition}} was played in London, Lord's and Oval, and Nottingham. Out of the 10 full members, Zimbabwe withdrew its participation. Ireland, Netherlands and Scotland qualified for the tournament. It was full of surprise victories, as favourites fell {{at the hands of}} underdogs. The hosts, England, set the ball rolling in the first match of the tournament as they were embarrassed by Netherlands in a final-ball thriller. Australia were dominated by West Indies, largely thanks to a thunderous innings by Chris Gayle, as he hit 88 off 50 balls, including some of the largest sixes seen in England. Australia were then defeated by Sri Lanka, who bowled tightly and batted with dominance, including quick-fire half centuries from Tillakaratne Dilshan and Kumar Sangakkara. Ireland beat Bangladesh in the Group stage to qualify for the Super Eight. Previous champions, India, lost all its matches of the Super Eight Stage. South Africa hadn't lost a group stage match going into the semi-finals against Pakistan, but Shahid Afridi produced a match winning performance with both bat and ball. He blasted his way to 51 and bagged two wickets for 16 runs to secure victory. The final at Lord's was a repeat of a group stage match between Sri Lanka and Pakistan; the latter lost the previous encounter. Pakistan managed to remove Dilshan, the Player of the Series for his 317 runs, without scoring, which had a big impact on the Sri Lanka innings. Sangakkara put up a fight scoring an unbeaten 64, but a target of 138 wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> to defend. Afridi proved this to be correct, hitting an unbeaten 54, which helped Pakistan win the trophy with 8 balls to spare.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{original}} title was [...] "Hey Jules", {{and it was}} intended to comfort Julian Lennon from the stress of his parents' separation.

"I'll try {{to deserve}} your confidence," [...] Walthew answered, and {{added with a}} naïvely {{thoughtful}} air: [...] "My people will come round; the only thing they'll insist on is that I enter the family business, and that's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> than I thought." ...|$|R
60|$|Conger half listened. It <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> {{than he had}} thought. Clearly, {{he would}} know {{as soon as the}} Founder appeared. These people, so {{suspicious}} of anything different, would be buzzing and gossiping and spreading the story. All he had <b>to</b> do <b>was</b> lie low and listen, down at the general store, perhaps. Or even here, in Mrs. Appleton's boarding house.|$|R
5|$|Reflecting on his {{stint in}} first season of Indian Super League, Chopra {{admitted}} that ISL turned out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> much more intense and competitive {{than he had}} anticipated. He said“I think {{there were a few}} things that went wrong; I underestimated the ISL. I thought it <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> than it <b>was,</b> and then I picked up a hamstring injury in pre-season which set me back.|$|R
500|$|Discussing his onscreen {{relationship}} with Yang, McKidd said: [...] "It's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> for them. What I read when I read the season premiere, {{and this is}} just my take on it, is that it was very much two very analytical people, Owen and Cristina. They're very similar in a way, I think, as people. Two analytical people see each other over a crowded ER room and their eyes meet." [...] On the topic of Yang's triumphs and challenges in the eighth season, Oh said: [...] "It has been an extremely challenging year that has had a lot of ups and downs, both challenging and exhilarating. We would shoot all our scenes {{for a day or two}} straight, and that was extremely challenging because emotionally and physically it becomes really exhausting." ...|$|E
500|$|Roger Moore, {{the third}} actor to play Bond in the films, said that Craig was a [...] "damn good Bond {{but the film}} as a whole, {{there was a bit}} too much flash cutting [...] it was just like a {{commercial}} of the action. There didn't seem to be any geography and you were wondering what the hell was going on." [...] Kim Newman of Empire gave it 4/5, remarking it was not [...] "bigger and better than Casino Royale, [...] perhaps a smart move in that there's still a sense at the finish that Bond's mission has barely begun." [...] However, he expressed nostalgia for the more humorous Bond films. The Sunday Times review noted that [...] "following Casino Royale was never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy,</b> but the director Marc Forster has brought the brand's successful relaunch crashing back to earth – with a yawn"; the screenplay [...] "is at times incomprehensible" [...] and the casting [...] "is a mess." [...] The review concludes that [...] "Bond has been stripped of his iconic status. He no longer represents anything particularly British, or even modern. In place of glamour, we get a spurious grit; instead of style, we get product placement; in place of fantasy, we get a redundant and silly realism." [...] The Guardian gave a more positive review, rating it as 3/5 stars, and was particularly fond of Craig's performance, saying he [...] "made the part his own, every inch the coolly ruthless agent-killer, nursing a broken heart and coldly suppressed rage" [...] and calling the film [...] "a crash-bang Bond, high on action, low on quips, long on location glamour, short on product placement"; it concludes [...] "Quantum of Solace isn't as good as Casino Royale: the smart elegance of Craig's Bond debut has been toned down in favour of conventional action. But the man himself powers this movie; he carries the film: it's an indefinably difficult task for an actor. Craig measures up." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{because of}} Eiseley's intense and poetic writing style and {{his focus on}} nature and cosmology, he was not {{accepted}} or understood by most of his colleagues. [...] "You," [...] a friend told him, [...] "are a freak, you know. A God-damned freak, and life is never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>easy</b> for you. You like scholarship, but the scholars, some of them, anyhow, {{are not going to}} like you because you don’t stay in the hole where God supposedly put you. You keep sticking your head out and looking around. In a university that’s inadvisable." ...|$|E

2500|$|By April 2006 Purden had {{returned}} to Glasgow's West End after having spent 12 years in London. He said that being back in Scotland was a [...] "breath of fresh air" [...] and added: [...] "Life seemed too hard in London. I needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> there initially because of my career but now that I'm more established I feel it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> commute.

60|$|The truth is, I {{have got}} my hero (or heroine) {{into such a}} {{particularly}} close place that I do not see how I am {{ever going to get}} him (or her) out of it again, and therefore I will wash my hands of the whole business, and leave that person to get out the best way that offers---or else stay there.

6000|$|... "I'm afraid that's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> so <b>easy,</b> Sam. Sometimes I {{think that}} we'll never hear a word more about those bonds;" [...] and Tom heaved a deep sigh.|$|R

50|$|A 2000 {{study by}} Uri Gneezy and Aldo Rustichini, A Fine Is a Price, {{has shown that}} {{introducing}} a fine for a previously unfined behavior may increase, rather than decrease, the unwanted behavior. This happens as the fine replaces a previous set of moral or ethical norms, {{and if it is}} low enough, it <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> overcome than the non-monetary criticism was. In other words, putting a price on something previously not on a market changes its perception drastically, and on occasion it can change it contradictory to what a deterrence theory would predict.|$|R

60|$|The {{play was}} {{fast and furious}} from the start, and in a very few minutes Dave and his chums {{understood}} that to gain a victory <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> no <b>easy</b> thing.

40|$|In the 1990 s it <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> draw voting districts. It <b>is</b> also <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> harder <b>to</b> justify them. They <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{explained}} in terms of increasingly sophisticated theories of fair districting. How, then, does one demonstrate a link between a particular plan and the multiple criteria for fair districting? It is proposed that a reapportionment plan can be described in terms of the eigenfunctions of a connectivity matrix. By making explicit the valencies linking nodes in a network of polygons, and/or adjusting the values in the main diagonal, the mapable eigenvectors of the connectivity matrix representing the network provide a mathematical rationale for a districting plan. This creates the possibility of simultaneously taking into account joint, and sometimes conflicting, districting criteria such as contiguity, equal population, and the protection of communities of interest. ...|$|R
