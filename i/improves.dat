5|$|A {{secondary}} control input that the rider can make is to lean the upper torso {{relative to the}} bike. As mentioned above, the effectiveness of rider lean varies inversely with {{the mass of the}} bike. On heavy bikes, such as motorcycles, rider lean mostly alters the ground clearance requirements in a turn, <b>improves</b> the view of the road, and <b>improves</b> the bike system dynamics in a very low-frequency passive manner. In motorcycle racing, leaning the torso, moving the body, and projecting a knee {{to the inside of the}} turn relative to the bike can also cause an aerodynamic yawing moment that facilitates entering and rounding the turn.|$|E
