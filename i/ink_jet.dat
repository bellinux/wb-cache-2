25|$|Like <b>ink</b> <b>jet</b> {{material}} depositioning, inkjet etching (IJE) deposits precise {{amounts of}} solvent onto a substrate designed to selectively dissolve {{the substrate material}} and induce a structure or pattern. Inkjet etching of polymer layers in OLED's {{can be used to}} increase the overall out-coupling efficiency. In OLEDs, light produced from the emissive layers of the OLED is partially transmitted out of the device and partially trapped inside the device by total internal reflection (TIR). This trapped light is wave-guided along the interior of the device until it reaches an edge where it is dissipated by either absorption or emission. Inkjet etching can be used to selectively alter the polymeric layers of OLED structures to decrease overall TIR and increase out-coupling efficiency of the OLED. Compared to a non-etched polymer layer, the structured polymer layer in the OLED structure from the IJE process helps to decrease the TIR of the OLED device. IJE solvents are commonly organic instead of water based due to their non-acidic nature and ability to effectively dissolve materials at temperatures under the boiling point of water.|$|E
500|$|In {{reproducing}} a mass-produced illustration in a painterly style, Lichtenstein simplifies {{by reducing}} the composition to primary colors, which serves to accentuates its mass appeal and largely gives it the [...] "pop" [...] look. Typically, Ben-Day dots enable an artist to produce {{a variety of colors}} by using dots of a few colors to give the illusion of a broader pallet. By mixing dots of different colors, like an <b>ink</b> <b>jet</b> printer, just a few colors can create a broad spectrum using {{only a limited number of}} primary hues. Lichtenstein as a painter and not a mass production printer is able to avoid this, achieving his individual color tones without blending existing hues.

Cephalopods are an ecologically key taxon that likely use sound and may be impacted by increasing anthropogenic ocean noise, but little is known regarding their behavioral responses or adaptations to sound stimuli. These experiments identify the acoustic range and levels that elicit a wide range of secondary defense behaviors such as <b>inking,</b> <b>jetting,</b> and rapid coloration change. Secondarily, it was found that cuttlefish habituate to certain sound stimuli. The present study examined the behavioral responses of 22 cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis) to pure-tone pips ranging from 80 - 1000 Hz with sound pressure levels of 85 – 188 dB re 1 µPa rms and particle accelerations of 0 - 17. 1 m. s- 2. Cuttlefish escape responses (<b>inking,</b> <b>jetting)</b> were observed between frequencies of 80 - 300 Hz and at sound levels above 140 dB re 1 µPa rms and 0. 01 m. s- 2 (0. 74 m. s- 2 for inking responses). Body patterning changes and fin movements were observed at all frequencies and sound levels. Response intensity was dependent upon stimulus amplitude and frequency, suggesting that cuttlefish also possess loudness perception with a maximum sensitivity around 150 Hz. Cuttlefish habituated to repeated 200 Hz tone pips, at two sound intensities. Total response inhibition was not reached, however, and a basal response remained present in most animals. The graded responses provide a loudness sensitivity curve and suggest an ecological function for sound-use in cephalopods...|$|R

30|$|In summary, we have {{developed}} a new method to fabricate conductive copper electrodes on a PDMS substrate, using one-step laser direct reduction. Owing to the laser heating while scanning, ethylene glycol is decomposed to aldehyde, which reduces the copper (II) to copper (0). A low copper electrode resistivity of about 96 μΩ cm on the PDMS has been achieved, which {{is comparable to the}} resistivity based on silver nanowire or carbon nanotube materials fabricated using the <b>ink</b> <b>jetting</b> method. Furthermore, this PDMS-supported copper sensor exhibits excellent performance with ultrahigh sensitivity, under both tensile and compressive strains. The high sensor performance was translated into function device development, in terms of human motion sensing and an electrical switch. The combination of the laser direct reduction of copper ions and the transfer printing on PDMS, for the low-cost production of wearable electronic devices, meets the cost and reliability demands. Therefore, the current study is expected to contribute to the advancing fabrication of flexible electronic devices, for next-generation wearable electronic systems.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} case study about inkjet {{printing}} {{as a tool for}} molecular patterning of silicon oxide surfaces with hydrophobic functionality, mediated by n-octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) molecules. In contrast to state-of-the-art techniques such as micro contact printing or chemical immersion with subsequent lithography processes, piezo drop-on-demand inkjet printing does not depend on physical masters, which allows an effective direct-write patterning of rigid or flexible substrates and enables short run-lengths of the individual pattern. In this paper, we used mesithylene-based OTS <b>inks,</b> <b>jetted</b> them in droplets of 10 pL on a silicon oxide surface, evaluated the water contact angle of the patterned areas and fitted the results with Cassie's law. For inks of 2. 0 mM OTS concentration, we found that effective area coverages of 38 % can be obtained. Our results hence show that contact times of the order of hundred milliseconds are sufficient to form a pattern of regions with O TS molecules adsorbed to the surface, representing at least a fragmented, inhomogeneous self-assembled OTS monolayer (OTS-SAM) ...|$|R

However, current screen printing pastes are neither able to provide the adequate line geometry nor make good ohmic contact to high sheet resistance emitter. This paper uses a combination of inkjet printing and light induced plating of silver to solve both problems. The <b>ink</b> <b>jetting</b> of grid lines is used to write 38 m wide and 4 m tall seed lines. These grid lines grow to 65 m wide and 20 - 25 m tall after light induced plating of silver. The silver plating solution penetrates the entire contact region underneath the grid lines to reduce the PbO in the glass layer to Pb metal in addition to plating the silver crystallites underneath. This lowers the contact resistance. Prolonged plating builds the line height to reduce the line resistance.

40|$|Cellulose {{derivatives}} containing associating hydrophobic groups {{along their}} hydrophilic backbone {{are used as}} rheology modifiers {{in the formulation of}} water-based spray paints, medicinal sprays, cosmetics and printable <b>inks.</b> <b>Jetting</b> and spraying applications of these materials involve progressive thinning and break-up of a fluid column or sheet into drops. Strong extensional kinematics develop in the thinning fluid neck. In viscous Newtonian fluids, inertial and viscous stresses oppose the surface tension-driven instability. In aqueous solutions of polymers such as Ethyl Hydroxy-Ethyl Cellulose (EHEC), chain elongation provides additional elastic stresses that can delay the capillary-driven pinch-off, influencing the sprayability or jettability of the complex fluid. In this study, we quantify the transient response of thinning filaments of cellulose ether solutions to extensional flows in a Capillary Break-up Extensional Rheometer (CaBER) and in a forced jet undergoing break-up using Rayleigh Ohnesorge Jetting Extensional Rheometry (ROJER). We also characterize the steady state molecular deformations using measurements of the flow-induced birefringence and excess pressure drop in an extensional stagnation point flow using a Cross-Slot Extensional Rheometer (CSER). We show that under the high extension rates encountered in jetting and spraying, the semi-dilute solutions of hydrophobically modified ethyl hydroxy-ethyl cellulose (hmEHEC) exhibit extensional thinning, while the unmodified bare chains of EHEC display an increase in extensional viscosity, up to a plateau value. For both EHEC and hmEHEC dispersions, the low extensibility of the cellulose derivatives limits the Trouton ratio observed at the highest extension rates attained (close to 10 [superscript 5] s[superscript − 1]) to around 10 – 20. The reduction in extensional viscosity with increasing extension rate for the hydrophobically modified cellulose ether is primarily caused by the disruption of a transient elastic network that is initially formed by intermolecular association of hydrophobic stickers. This extensional thinning behavior, in conjunction with the low extensibility of the hydrophobically modified cellulose ether additives, makes these rheology modifiers ideal for controlling the extensional rheology in formulations that require jetting or spraying, with minimal residual stringiness or stranding.
