40|$|Objectives: We {{assessed}} {{the frequency of}} oral candidiasis and the association between demo-graphic variables, disease-related variables, corticosteroid treatment, other treatments and the occurrence of oral candidiasis in the Hopkins Lupus Cohort. Methods: In this large prospect-ive cohort study of 2258 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), demographic and clinical associates of oral candidiasis were estimated by univariate, multivariate and within-person regression models. Results: There were 53, 548 cohort visits. Oral candidiasis was diagnosed at 675 visits (1. 25 %) in 325 (14 %) of the patients. In the multivariate analyses, oral candidiasis was associated with African-American ethnicity, SELENA-SLEDAI disease activity, high white blood cell count, a history of bacterial infection, prednisone use and immunosuppressive use. The urine protein by urine <b>dip</b> <b>stick</b> was higher in SLE patients with oral candidiasis. Considering only patients who had candidiasis at some visits in a ‘within-person ’ analysis, candidiasis was more frequent in visits with higher SELENA-SLEDAI disease activity, high white blood cell count, proteinuria by urine <b>dip</b> <b>stick,</b> a history of bacterial infection and prednisone use. The use of hydroxychloroquine {{was associated with a}} lower risk of oral candidiasis, but was not statistically significant (p 0. 50) in the within-person analysis models.

40|$|During {{the last}} fifteen years, it has become {{apparent}} that capacity building is an important ingredient for sustainable development. In this regard, governments in Africa rank capacity building for infrastructure delivery amongst the top priorities for promoting sustainable development. A large share of Africa’s infrastructure is domestically financed, with the central government budget being the main driver of infrastructure investment.

Materials and Methods: Approximately 400, 000 patients shall be enrolled in this multicentric, cross sectional study. Patients meeting eligibility criteria shall be screened for MAU through urine dipstick test using random daytime single spot urine specimen. Result shall be expressed either positive or negative based on {{the presence or absence}} of albumin in the urine and will be correlated with the corresponding random blood glucose.

40|$|AIM: To {{survey the}} use made of {{laboratory}} services for urgent tests and clinicians' attitudes to near patient testing. METHODS: A questionnaire {{was sent to}} clinicians working in acute hospitals within Trent and North West Thames Regions. RESULTS: 197 replies were received. Most demand came from intensive care units. Overall, clinicians requested a median of six urgent tests a day. Blood glucose and <b>dip</b> <b>stick</b> urine testing were the most commonly performed bedside tests, but 41 % of clinicians did not use ward testing. The most frequently cited indication for bedside testing was the need for speed. 85 % of clinicians trusted results obtained in their central hospital laboratory, {{but there was an}} almost equal division between those who did (34 %) {{and those who did not}} (38 %) trust the results from near patient testing. A slightly larger proportion indicated they would accept responsibility (44 %) for results obtained on the ward than would not (35 %).

40|$|A simple visual ethanol {{biosensor}} {{based on}} alcohol oxidase (AOX) immobilised onto polyaniline (PANI) film for halal verification of fermented beverage samples is described. This biosensor responds to ethanol via a colour change from green to blue, {{due to the}} enzymatic reaction of ethanol that produces acetaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide, when the latter oxidizes the PANI film. The procedure to obtain this biosensor consists of the immobilization of AOX onto PANI film by adsorption. For the immobilisation, an AOX solution is deposited on the PANI film and left at room temperature until dried (30 min). The biosensor was constructed as a <b>dip</b> <b>stick</b> for visual and simple use. The colour changes of the films have been scanned and analysed using image analysis software (i. e., ImageJ) to study {{the characteristics of the}} biosensor’s response toward ethanol.

30|$|The {{productivity}} and environmental {{benefits of the}} minimum- and no-till aspects of conservation agriculture have been variously documented in the literature (Erenstein 2003; Hobbs 2007). Minimum tillage (or no-till) is a seedbed preparation method that involves minimizing the number of tillage operations by making only limited slots for placing the seed, either by using specialized machines (seeders) that open up small furrows in which seed is placed or by manually using ‘jab planters’, hoes or <b>dip</b> <b>sticks</b> to bore holes into which seeds are placed. In such cases, there is minimal soil disturbance since {{the rest of the}} field is left untilled. Mulching typically involves retaining crop residues and other plant materials on the surface of the plot to cover as much soil surface as possible. The mulch protects the soil from erosion, sun and wind, and the superficial biomass enhances infiltration and provides nutrition to the biota that aerate the soil. Erenstein (2003) enumerated the beneficial impacts of mulching on soil conservation, soil ecology, crop yields and the environment. If implemented properly, the combination of minimum tillage (or no-till) and mulching can alleviate or even halt soil erosion and lead to water conservation and reduced runoff, groundwater replenishment and enhancement of soil biota. In some cases, yield stabilization and increases have also been observed (Erenstein 1999, 2003).|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to develop an engine oil level {{monitoring}} system that will replace the current dipstick method during vehicle testing for Mercedes-Benz Research and Development North America, Inc. (MBRDNA). Currently, MBRDNA test drivers check the engine oil level twice a day after two eight hour shifts each day. To measure the oil level, the driver parks on a level surface, waits five minutes for the oil to cool, and then manually checks the oil level with the dipstick. The goal of this project {{is to have a}} reliable, physical, working prototype that MBRDNA can use for vehicle testing by spring. MBRDNA wants a prototype built {{by the end of this}} year that is capable of reading oil level without the need of a test driver to measure the oil. It is very easy for a driver to get distracted and forget to check the oil at precisely 5 minutes after the engine has been shut off. This leads to inconsistent results. Drivers are also susceptible to reading the dipstick incorrectly due to the small amount of increments on the end of the <b>dip</b> <b>stick</b> that must be read. Occasionally dipsticks will even break because they are not designed to with stand fatigue loading cycles that are seen during this testing.

The larger flat end of bamboo satay sticks are {{more commonly used}} for single application of dots to paintings, but the sharp pointier end is used to create fine dots. To create superimposed dotting, artists may take a bunch of satay <b>sticks,</b> <b>dip</b> the pointy ends into the paint and then transfer them onto the canvas in quick successions of dotting.|$|R
2500|$|Finding food {{soon became}} the first preoccupation of the Parisians. The {{authorities}} of the German occupation transformed French industry and agriculture into a machine for serving Germany. Shipments to Germany had first priority; what was left went to Paris {{and the rest of}} France. All of the trucks manufactured at the Citroen factory went directly to Germany. (Later many of these trucks were cleverly sabotaged by the French workers, who recalibrated the <b>dip</b> <b>sticks</b> so that the trucks would run out of oil without notice). The greatest share of shipments of meat, wheat, milk produce and other agricultural products also went to Germany. What remained for the Parisians was strictly rationed, following the creation on 16 June 1940 of the Ministère de l'agriculture et du ravitaillement (Ministry of Agriculture and Supply), which began to impose a system rationing as early as 2 August 1940, as per Décret du 30 juillet 1940: bread, fat, flour products, rice, sugar; then, on 23 October 1940: butter, cheese, meat, coffee, charcuterie, eggs, oil; in July 1941: and as the war went on: chocolate, fish, dried vegetables, (like peas and beans), potatoes, fresh vegetables, wine, tobacco... Products could be bought only upon presentation of coupons attributed to specific items and on the specific week in which they could be used. Parisians (and all the population of France) were divided into seven categories depending upon their age, and allotted a certain amount of each product each month. A new bureaucracy, employing more than nine thousand city employees, with offices at all schools and the city hall of each arrondissement, was put into place to administer the program. The system resulted in long lines and frustrated hopes, since promised products often never appeared. Thousands of Parisians regularly made the long journey by bicycle to the countywide, hoping to come back, with vegetables, fruit, eggs and other farm products.|$|R
