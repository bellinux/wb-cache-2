40|$|Abstract Background The 30 -item disabilities of the arm, {{shoulder}} and hand (<b>DASH)</b> questionnaire is increasingly used in clinical research involving upper extremity musculoskeletal disorders. From the original <b>DASH</b> a shorter version, the 11 -item Quick <b>DASH,</b> has been developed. Little {{is known about}} the discriminant ability of score changes for the Quick <b>DASH</b> compared to the <b>DASH.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the performance of the Quick <b>DASH</b> and its cross-sectional and longitudinal validity and reliability. Methods The study was based on extracting Quick <b>DASH</b> item responses from the responses to the full-length <b>DASH</b> questionnaire completed by 105 patients with a variety of upper extremity disorders before surgery and at follow-up 6 to 21 months after surgery. The <b>DASH</b> and Quick <b>DASH</b> scores were compared for the whole population and for different diagnostic groups. For longitudinal construct validity the effect size and standardized response mean were calculated. Analyses with ROC curves were performed to compare the ability of the <b>DASH</b> and Quick <b>DASH</b> to discriminate among patients classified according to the magnitude of self-rated improvement. Cross-sectional and test-retest reliability was assessed. Results The mean <b>DASH</b> score was 34 (SD 22) and the mean Quick <b>DASH</b> score was 39 (SD 24) at baseline. For the different diagnostic groups the mean and median Quick <b>DASH</b> scores were higher than the corresponding <b>DASH</b> scores. For the whole population, the mean difference between the Quick <b>DASH</b> and <b>DASH</b> baseline scores was 4. 2 (95 % CI 3. 2 – 5. 3), follow-up scores was 2. 6 (1. 7 – 3. 4), and change scores was 1. 7 (0. 6 – 2. 8). The overall effect size and standardized response mean measured with the <b>DASH</b> and the Quick <b>DASH</b> were similar. In the ROC analysis of change scores among patients who rated their arm status as somewhat or much better and those who rated it as unchanged the difference in the area under the ROC curve for the <b>DASH</b> and Quick <b>DASH</b> was 0. 01 (95 % CI - 0. 05 – 0. 07) indicating similar discriminant ability. Cross-sectional and test-retest reliability of the <b>DASH</b> and Quick <b>DASH</b> were similar. Conclusion The results indicate that the Quick <b>DASH</b> can be used instead of the <b>DASH</b> with similar precision in upper extremity disorders. </p...|$|R

5|$|The {{problem of}} {{counting}} {{the number of}} solutions to different types of Apollonius' problem belongs to the field of enumerative geometry. The general number of solutions for each of the ten types of Apollonius' problem is given in Table1 above. However, special arrangements of the given elements may change the number of solutions. For illustration, Apollonius' problem has no solution if one circle separates the two (Figure11); to touch both the solid given circles, the solution circle would have to cross the <b>dashed</b> given circle; but that it cannot do, if it is to touch the <b>dashed</b> circle tangentially. Conversely, if three given circles are all tangent at the same point, then any circle tangent at the same point is a solution; such Apollonius problems have an infinite number of solutions. If any of the given circles are identical, there is likewise an infinity of solutions. If only two given circles are identical, there are only two distinct given circles; the centers of the solution circles form a hyperbola, as used in one solution to Apollonius' problem.|$|E
