5|$|At least 50% {{of people}} with {{pancreatic}} adenocarcinoma have diabetes {{at the time of}} diagnosis. While long-standing diabetes is a known risk factor for pancreatic cancer (see Risk factors), the cancer can itself cause <b>diabetes,</b> <b>in</b> which case recent onset of diabetes could be considered an early sign of the disease. People over 50 who develop diabetes have eight times the usual risk of developing pancreatic adenocarcinoma within three years, after which the relative risk declines.|$|E

There were ten cases of <b>diabetes</b> mellitus <b>in</b> pregnancy in Obstetrics Department Zainoel Abidin Hospital, Banda Aceh. Obstetrics outcomes were noted which include cesarean section, fetal distress, macrosomia, intra uterine fetal death, neonatal hypoglycemia, and neonatal death.

Garcia, whose annual salary was never greater than $35,000, died with more than $100,000 in outstanding medical bills.|$|E
5|$|Metformin, marketed {{under the}} trade name Glucophage among others, is the {{first-line}} medication {{for the treatment}} of type 2 diabetes, After ten years, the incidence of diabetes was 34% lower in the group of participants given diet and exercise and 18% lower in those given metformin.

He suffered two major heart attacks (in 1966 and 1969), and was on bed rest for six weeks after the second episode. State media reported that Nasser's absence from the public view at that time was a result of influenza.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{medicines}} are in wide use {{around the}} world. In {{most of the}} developing world, especially in rural areas, local traditional medicine, including herbalism, is (2015) {{the only source of}} health care for people, while in the developed world, alternative medicine including use of dietary supplements is marketed aggressively using the claims of traditional medicine. As of 2015, most products made from medicinal plants had not been tested for their safety and efficacy, and products that were marketed in developed economies and provided in the undeveloped world by traditional healers were of uneven quality, sometimes containing dangerous contaminants. Traditional Chinese medicine makes use {{of a wide variety of}} plants, among other materials and techniques. Researchers from Kew Gardens found 104 species used for <b>diabetes</b> <b>in</b> Central America, of which seven had been identified in at least three separate studies.

5|$|Stokvis {{was born}} to Rachel Wittering and Joseph Barend Stokvis, Jr., a Jewish {{physician}} and obstetrician in Amsterdam. He studied medicine in Amsterdam and at the University of Utrecht under Franciscus Donders and Jacobus Schroeder van der Kolk, obtaining a doctorate on a dissertation on hepatic glucose production in <b>diabetes</b> <b>in</b> 1856. His thesis appeared shortly {{after the publication of}} related work by the French physiologist Claude Bernard. Stokvis may also have been influenced by the chemist Gerardus Mulder in Amsterdam. Subsequently, he travelled to Paris and Vienna (and possibly Prague), before establishing himself in medical practice in Amsterdam. He continued his medical research under the physiologists Adriaan Heynsius, Wilhelm Kühne and Thomas Place. In 1867, the Brussels Academy awarded a gold medal to Stokvis for an essay on the development of albuminuria, a kidney disorder in which the protein albumin can be detected in the urine.|$|E
