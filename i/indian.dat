5|$|In 1888, the <b>Indian</b> Government {{proposed}} that the independent armies of the <b>Indian</b> Princely states provide the British Empire with troops for service on the North West Frontier and outside the <b>Indian</b> subcontinent. The states' forces were recognised by the <b>Indian</b> Government and the British <b>Indian</b> Army as allies, and their troops were subject to the <b>Indian</b> Army Act when serving alongside the <b>Indian</b> Army. When in the field, {{the commander of the}} British Forces alongside which any Imperial Service Troops were serving was recognised as the higher legal authority in accordance with the act. To eliminate supply problems, states' armies' field uniform and weapons were the same as the regular <b>Indian</b> Army, and the <b>Indian</b> Government appointed a staff of officers designated Military Advisers and Assistant Military Advisers to assist the independent states' rulers in the training and organisation of their forces. Imperial Service Troops were commanded by <b>Indian</b> officers. In contrast, British <b>Indian</b> Army units had British officers in all senior command posts; their own <b>Indian</b> Viceroy's commissioned officers were trained to only a troop or platoon level of command.|$|E
