2500|$|In the British press, the {{inclusion}} of a fictional journalist from the real British paper The Guardian and scenes set in the United Kingdom (particularly Waterloo railway station) were commented upon. In particular, that newspaper's reviewer joked that [...] "dodging bullets from a CIA sniper... is the sort of thing which <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> Guardian journalists all the time." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "A World Without" [...] {{is about}} a man whose wife dies during childbirth, and explores what <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> when we pass away, {{touching}} {{on topics such as}} reincarnation. The song includes many metaphors; for example, in the second verse: [...] "The guy is smoking a cigarette, and the wife becomes the cigarette, and she's the smoke he's breathing in. So, she's closer to him in this way then she ever could be in the flesh.(...)." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold thy peace, dear little Pearl!" [...] whispered her mother. [...] "We {{must not}} always {{talk in the}} {{marketplace}} of what <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> in the forest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> For {{four years}} now things have just <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> All the time I have been overworking, first at {{explosives}} and now at this fuel business. She too is full of her work.|$|R

60|$|Mike {{had often}} heard and read of people's hearts leaping to their mouths, {{but he had}} never before {{experienced}} that sensation of something hot and dry springing in the throat, which is what really <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> on receipt of a bad shock. A sickening feeling that the game was up beyond all hope of salvation came to him. He lay down again without a word.|$|E
6000|$|... "And so," [...] Miltoun went on, looking {{him through}} and through; [...] "to-morrow {{is to be}} your last day, too? Well, you're right to go. She is not an ugly duckling, who can live out of the social pond; she'll always want her native element. And now, we'll say goodbye! Whatever <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> both, I shall {{remember}} this evening." [...] Smiling, he put out his hand 'Moriturus te saluto.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said MacIan, [...] "we might {{occupy a}} day or two in drawing up a {{thorough}} and complete statement of what we did and why we did it, and all about both our points of view. Then we could leave one copy on the island whatever <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> and put another in an empty bottle and send it out to sea, as they do in the books." ...|$|E

60|$|The second {{incident}} {{that is perhaps}} worth recording was an adventure that <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> when we had completed about two of our four months' journey.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank God {{you have}} saved me. Some day, perhaps, I {{may be able}} to tell you how {{grateful}} I am; but, if not, you will know that if the worst <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> I shall die blessing you for what you have done for me. Pray do not linger longer in Cawnpore. You may be discovered, and if I am spared, it would embitter my life always to know that it had cost you yours. God bless you always.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{believe you}} do, my good fellow," [...] I answered, [...] "and I also am {{afraid of being}} killed, who only seem to be brave because I must. However, I hope we shall come through all right. Meanwhile, I am going to give this box and all the gold in it, of {{which there is a}} great deal, into your charge, Sammy, trusting to you, if {{anything}} <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> to get it safe back to Durban if you can." ...|$|E
60|$|There is {{no end to}} the {{influence}} of woman on our life. It is at the bottom of everything that <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> And so it was, that, {{in spite of all the}} combinations of Lucretia and Mr. Rigby, and the mortification and resentment of Lord Monmouth, the favourable impression he casually made on a couple of French actresses occasioned Coningsby, before a month had elapsed since his memorable interview at Monmouth House, to receive an invitation again to dine with his grandfather.|$|E
6000|$|... “Something has <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Lord Castlewood,” Captain Westbury said, in a vary grave tone—“something {{which must}} <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> all. He is dead of a wound {{received}} at the Boyne, fighting for King James.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Something has <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Lord Castlewood," [...] Captain Westbury {{said in a}} very grave tone--"something {{which must}} <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> all. He is dead of a wound {{received}} at the Boyne, fighting for King James." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Push {{yourself}} {{away from}} everything {{as well as}} you can," [...] he whispered, [...] "and, Geraldine--if anything should <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> I never changed--not for a moment." ...|$|R
6000|$|HON. It <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> as it happeneth to wayfaring men: {{sometimes}} our way is clean, sometimes up-hill, sometimes down-hill: we {{are seldom}} at a certainty. The wind {{is not always}} on our back, nor is every one a friend that we meet with in the way. We have met with some notable rubs already, and what are yet behind we know not; but, {{for the most part}} we find it true that has been talked of, of old, [...] "A good man must suffer trouble." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “This and {{the other}} affair were a lesson to me {{as well as to}} the captain. No matter how {{friendly}} the natives might appear, from that day I have never anchored among the islands without having half my guns double-shotted, {{and the other}} half loaded with grape; and there is always an officer and half a watch on deck, so that, whatever <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> it will not be because I have been caught napping. On both those occasions the captains well-nigh lost ship and crew by their carelessness.” ...|$|E
60|$|HON. It <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> as it happeneth to wayfaring men; {{sometimes}} our way is clean, sometimes foul, sometimes up hill, sometimes down hill; we {{are seldom}} at a certainty; {{the wind is}} not always on our backs, nor is everyone a friend that we meet with in the way. We have met with some notable rubs already; and what are yet behind, we know not; {{but for the most}} part, we find it true, that has been talked of, of old, A good man must suffer trouble.|$|E
60|$|And now I come {{to perhaps}} the strangest {{adventure}} that <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> {{in all this}} strange business, and one which shows how wonderfully things are brought about.|$|R
6000|$|... "We're growing up," [...] she cries. [...] "That's {{what has}} <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> We shall never fight again with {{our hands and}} feet, never--until death do us part." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And did I {{drop her}} {{from the list of}} my friends? No, sir," [...] said a scarlet-lipped vision in white lace; [...] "that might <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> any day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Just so! The {{condemned}} {{social order}} {{has not been}} built up on paper and ink, and I don’t fancy {{that a combination of}} paper and ink will ever put an end to it, whatever you may think. Yes, I would give the stuff with both hands to every man, woman, or fool that likes to come along. I know what you are thinking about. But I am not taking my cue from the Red Committee. I would see you all hounded out of here, or arrested—or beheaded for that matter—without turning a hair. What <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> as individuals is not of the least consequence.” ...|$|E
60|$|Both are {{astonished}} at the falling {{off in the}} other one, but neither sees their own change. If they did they would not suffer as they do. They would look for the cause in the right quarter--in the littleness of poor human nature--join hands over their common failing, and start building their house anew on a more earthly and enduring foundation. But we are so blind to our own shortcomings, so wide awake to those of others. Everything that <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> is always the other person's fault. Angelina would have gone on loving Edwin forever and ever and ever if only Edwin had not grown so strange and different. Edwin would have adored Angelina through eternity if Angelina had only remained the same as when he first adored her.|$|E
60|$|At {{the sound}} of his voice, the Princess of Bengal {{suddenly}} grew calm, and an expression of joy overspread her face, such as only comes when what we wish for most and expect the least suddenly <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> For some time she was too enchanted to speak, and Prince Firouz Schah took advantage of her silence to explain to her all that had occurred, his despair at watching her disappear before his very eyes, the oath he had sworn to follow her over the world, and his rapture at finally discovering her in the palace at Cashmere. When he had finished, he begged in his turn that the princess would tell him how she had come there, so that he might the better devise some means of rescuing her from the tyranny of the Sultan.|$|E
6000|$|... "God bless you, du Tillet!" [...] {{the marquis}} {{said as he}} embraced his friend. [...] "Should aught <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> you will, I know, be a father to them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have noticed," [...] Frank said, [...] "that {{there have}} been fewer men about than usual {{during the last few}} days. What will <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> do you think?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{what has}} <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> all!" [...] my sister joined in. [...] "Look at me--I've lost my pendant! Paul, {{did you give}} <b>us</b> too much <b>to</b> drink, or what?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Even sin," [...] {{returned}} the doctor. [...] "Don't {{you see that}} it was Getall's sin of greed and over-speculation, and the clerk's sin of embezzlement, which led to all these good results; but, of course, as neither of them had any desire or intention to achieve the good results which God brought about, they were none the less guilty, and were entitled to no credit, but, on the contrary, to condign punishment. What I wish to prove is that God causes all things to work out His will, yet leaves the free-will of man untouched. This is a great mystery; {{at the same time it}} is a great fact, and therefore I contend that we have every reason to trust our loving Father, knowing that whatever <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> will be for the best--not, perhaps, for our present pleasure or gratification, but for our ultimate best." ...|$|E
60|$|The unchanging Man {{of history}} is wonderfully {{adaptable}} both by his power of endurance and in his capacity for detachment. The fact {{seems to be that}} the play of his destiny is too great for his fears and too mysterious for his understanding. Were the trump of the Last Judgement to sound suddenly on a working day the musician at his piano would go on with his performance of Beethoven's sonata and the cobbler at his stall stick to his last in undisturbed confidence in the virtues of the leather. And with perfect propriety. For what are we to let ourselves be disturbed by an angel's vengeful music too mighty for our ears and too awful for our terrors? Thus it <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> to be struck suddenly by the lightning of wrath. The reader will go on reading if the book pleases him and the critic will go on criticizing with that faculty of detachment born perhaps from a sense of infinite littleness and which is yet the only faculty that seems to assimilate man to the immortal gods.|$|E
60|$|Now, without {{deciding}} whether the ultimate laws of our mental nature are few or many, {{it is at}} least certain that they are of the above description. It is certain that our mental states, and our mental capacities and susceptibilities, are modified, either for a time or permanently, by every thing which <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> in life. Considering, therefore, how much these modifying causes differ in the case of any two individuals, it would be unreasonable to expect that the empirical laws of the human mind, the generalizations which can be made respecting the feelings or actions of mankind without reference to the causes that determine them, should be any thing but approximate generalizations. They are the common wisdom of common life, and as such are invaluable; especially as they are mostly to be applied to cases not very dissimilar to those from which they were collected. But when maxims of this sort, collected from Englishmen, come to be applied to Frenchmen, or when those collected from the present day are applied to past or future generations, they are apt to be very much at fault. Unless we have resolved the empirical law into the laws of the causes on which it depends, and ascertained that those causes extend to the case which we have in view, there can be no reliance placed in our inferences. For every individual is surrounded by circumstances different from those of every other individual; every nation or generation of mankind from every other nation or generation: and none of these differences are without their influence in forming a different type of character. There is, indeed, also a certain general resemblance; but peculiarities of circumstances are continually constituting exceptions even to the propositions which are true in the great majority of cases.|$|E
6000|$|... "That was the doubt," [...] said Margaret, [...] "but papa said {{he would}} answer for it nothing would <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> and mamma said {{if you would be}} so kind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This is {{a terrible}} blow," [...] she said. [...] "It {{is the worst thing}} which has <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> for years. Are you going over to the other side, Lawrence?" ...|$|R
