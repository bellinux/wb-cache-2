Preferable product style of a fashion trend is widely accepted to visually enhance a product to satisfy today’s consumer demands. Considerable work remains to be done to integrate product styling (process to create and deliver visual pleasure) with manufacturing flexibility, i. e. platform approach, reusability. This paper reports on the initial findings from an exploratory study that consists of interviews and research on ‘‘i-Mac look’ ’ style. It examines the relationships between product style/styling and fashion trend on consumer preferences. The findings indicate that style can be manipulated by a proposed set of complex attributes. A particular style plus its application method(s) together function as an intangible module to refresh ordinary products. Implications are drawn to develop two frameworks: product styling platform and a case-based <b>indexing</b> <b>device</b> for product styling. The case-based <b>indexing</b> <b>device</b> serves as a support for the product styling platform.

40|$|Searching of {{databases}} (textual or numeric) {{is likely}} to be effective and efficient only if the user is familiar with the classification, categorizing, and indexing schemes (metadata vocabularies) being searched. Therefore, it is obviously beneficial to provide a bridge between the user’s ordinary language and the metadata vocabularies of the unfamiliar database in order to compensate for abbreviated, cryptic, or specialized terminologies. Advanced search technologies would utilize customized “Entry Vocabulary Modules” (EVM) which respond adaptively to the user’s ordinary language query with a ranked list of search terms in the target metadata vocabularies that may more accurately represent what is sought in the unfamiliar database. These “Entry Vocabulary Modules ” can serve both as an <b>indexing</b> <b>device</b> and a search aid.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The trends of rapid manufacturing (RM) have influenced numerous developments of technologies mainly in additive processes. However, the material compatibility and accuracy problems of additive techniques have limited the ability to manufacture end-user products. More established manufacturing methods such as Computer Numerical Controlled (CNC) machining can be adapted for RM under some circumstances. The use of a 3 -axis CNC milling machine with an <b>indexing</b> <b>device</b> increases tool accessibility and overcomes most of the process constraints. However, more work is required to enhance the application of CNC for RM, and this thesis focuses on the improvement of roughing and finishing operations and the integration of cutting tools in CNC machining to make it viable for RM applications. The purpose {{of this research is}} to further adapt CNC machining to rapid manufacturing, and it is believed that implementing the suggested approaches will speed up production, enhance part quality and make the process more suitable for RM. A feasible approach to improving roughing operations is investigated through the adoption of different cutting orientations. Simulation analyses are performed to manipulate the values of the orientations and to generate estimated cutting times. An orientations set with minimum machining time is selected to execute roughing processes. Further development is carried out to integrate different tool geometries; flat and ball nose end mill in the finishing processes. A surface classification method is formulated to assist the integration and to define the cutting regions. To realise a rapid machining system, the advancement of Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) is exploited. This allows CNC process planning to be handled through customised programming codes. The findings from simulation studies are supported by the machining experiment results. First, roughing through four independent orientations minimized the cutting time and prevents any susceptibility to tool failure. Secondly, the integration of end mill tools improves surface quality of the machined parts. Lastly, the process planning programs manage to control the simulation analyses and construct machining operations effectively...|$|E

The gradient of the refractive index is achieved by locally changing {{the thickness of the}} plate, exploiting in this way the thickness-dependence of the dispersion relation of flexural waves in thin plates. A well-like thickness profile in an annular region of the plate is used to mimic the combination of an attractive and repulsive potentials, focusing waves at its bottom and dissipating them by means of a properly designed absorptive layer placed on top of the plate. The central area is therefore isolated from vibrations while they are dissipated {{at the bottom of the}} well.

In contrast to most rheometers, which {{by their very nature}} are concerned with producing viscometric or nearly-viscometric flows, here we make use of an elastic instability that occurs in the flow of viscoelastic fluids with curved streamlines. To calibrate the rheometer we combine simple scaling arguments with relaxation times obtained from first normal-stress difference data measured in a classical shear rheometer. As an additional check we also compare these relaxation times to those obtained from Zimm theory and good agreement is observed. Once calibrated, we show how the serpentine rheometer can be used to access smaller polymer concentrations and lower solvent viscosities where classical measurements become difficult or impossible to use due to inertial and/or resolution limitations.
