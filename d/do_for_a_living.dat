I have {{a different set of}} tools, but it's the same process. The reason that it's fun to design sets is that it allows you to try on personalities that you'd never otherwise experience." [...] Gary Ross, director of Pleasantville and Seabiscuit, said of Oppewall, [...] "Jeannine doesn't suffer fools gladly, and she hasn't suffered me gladly when I've been a fool. She's fastidious, restrained and refined, and yet she has this impulsive side where she just takes off and chases butterflies." [...] Gary Hoblit, who directed the 1996 Oppewall-designed film Primal Fear, said he particularly appreciated her flexibility and versatility: [...] "While she may prefer a world in which less is more, she can still create an opulent and gooey world that is appropriate for someone unlike her." ...|$|E

2500|$|Randi {{has been}} accused of {{actually}} using [...] "psychic powers" [...] to perform acts such as spoon bending. According to James Alcock, at a meeting where Randi was duplicating the performances of Uri Geller, a professor from the University at Buffalo shouted out that Randi was a fraud. Randi said: [...] "Yes, indeed, I'm a trickster, I'm a cheat, I'm a charlatan, that's what I <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>living.</b> Everything I've done here was by trickery."

You're a fraud because you're pretending to do these things through trickery, but you're actually using psychic powers and misleading us by not admitting it." [...] A similar event involved Senator Claiborne Pell, a confirmed believer in psychic phenomena. When Randi personally demonstrated to Pell that he could reveal—by simple trickery—a concealed drawing that had been secretly made by the senator, Pell refused to believe that it was a trick, saying: [...] "I think Randi may be a psychic and doesn't realize it." [...] Randi has consistently denied having any paranormal powers or abilities.|$|E
2500|$|Raging Bull {{came about}} when De Niro read the [...] {{on the set}} of The Godfather Part II. Although {{disappointed}} by the book's writing style, he became fascinated by the character of Jake LaMotta. He showed the book to Martin Scorsese {{on the set of}} Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore in the hope that he would consider the project. Scorsese repeatedly turned down the opportunity to sit in the director's chair, claiming {{he had no idea what}} Raging Bull was about, even though he had read some of the text. Never a sports fan, when he found out what LaMotta used to <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>living,</b> he said, [...] "A boxer? I don't like boxing...Even as a kid, I always thought that boxing was boring... It was something I couldn't, wouldn't grasp."

[...] The book was then passed onto Mardik Martin, the film's eventual co-screenwriter, who said [...] "the trouble is the damn thing has been done a hundred times before—a fighter who has trouble with his brother and his wife and the mob is after him". The book was even shown to producers Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler by De Niro, who were willing to assist only if Scorsese agreed. After nearly dying from a drug overdose, Scorsese agreed to make the film, not only to save his own life but also to save his career. Scorsese began to relate very personally to the story of Jake LaMotta, and in it he saw how the boxing ring can be [...] "an allegory for whatever you do in life”, which for him paralleled moviemaking, “you make movies, you’re in the ring each time.” ...|$|E

Of course, it was no use my trying to doctor people, when they could not tell me what was the matter with them, and I worked at one thing and another, doing {{anything}} I could turn my hands to, for four or five months.

Why, I am so useless that even when my poor boy earned 25 pounds for his picture, I felt we were bound to send it to Sarah Mason, and you may fancy when this came to Mrs. Mackenzie's ears, what a life my boy and I led. I have never spoken of these things to any mortal soul--I even don't speak of them with Clive--but seeing your kind and honest face has made me talk--you must pardon my garrulity--I am growing old, Arthur.

I was so hopeful that better days were in store for us, and the end seemed to come so suddenly ... and my striving had been in vain ... and the fight was lost. I know that I must rouse myself, that I have to work for a living, only just now I seem to have lost all desire to do anything, all energy. But I know, Fan, that this will not last. Grief for the dead does not endure long--never long enough. I must work, and there is nothing I shall ever care to <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>living</b> except literary work.

But that will take time, and just now I could not put pen to paper, even to save myself from starving. For a little longer, dear, I must be contented to live on your charity." ...|$|E
