Types of frictions under consideration include fixed and proportional transaction costs, bid–ask spreads, taxes, and upper bounds on the number of units for transaction. We develop a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of arbitrage. In addition, we obtain some negative result on computational difficulty in general for arbitrage under those frictions: it is NP-complete to identify whether there exists a cash-and-carry <b>arbitrage</b> <b>transaction</b> and it is NP-hard to find an optimal cash-and-carry <b>arbitrage</b> <b>transaction...</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Arbitrage</b> <b>transactions</b> {{in modern}} {{securities}} markets involve fairly low day-to-day risks, but can face extremely high risk in rare situations, particularly financial crises, {{and can lead}} to bankruptcy. Formally, <b>arbitrage</b> <b>transactions</b> have negative skew - prices can get a small amount closer (but often no closer than 0), while they can get very far apart. The day-to-day risks are generally small because the transactions involve small differences in price, so an execution failure will generally cause a small loss (unless the trade is very big or the price moves rapidly). The rare case risks are extremely high because these small price differences are converted to large profits via leverage (borrowed money), and in the rare event of a large price move, this may yield a large loss.|$|R

First, they examine {{the frequency of}} attaining simultaneous equilibrium on spot and forward foreign exchange markets and on domestic and foreign securities markets. Second, they measure the profitability of covered <b>interest</b> <b>arbitrage</b> and one-way arbitrage. The authors' empirical analysis has been conducted using real-time quotations. The empirical {{results indicate that the}} markets are efficient in the sense that profit opportunities from traditional covered <b>interest</b> <b>arbitrage</b> are rarely available and the frequency of attaining simultaneous market equilibrium is surprisingly low, thus opening the door for one-way arbitrage.

50|$|Competition in the {{marketplace}} can also create risks during <b>arbitrage</b> <b>transactions.</b> As an example, if one was trying to profit from a price discrepancy between IBM on the NYSE and IBM on the London Stock Exchange, they may purchase {{a large number of}} shares on the NYSE and find that they cannot simultaneously sell on the LSE. This leaves the arbitrageur in an unhedged risk position.|$|R
50|$|Another risk occurs if {{the items}} being {{bought and sold}} are not {{identical}} and the arbitrage is conducted {{under the assumption that}} the prices of the items are correlated or predictable; this is more narrowly referred to as a convergence trade. In the extreme case this is merger arbitrage, described below. In comparison to the classical quick <b>arbitrage</b> <b>transaction,</b> such an operation can produce disastrous losses.|$|R

50|$|Uncovered <b>interest</b> <b>{{arbitrage}}</b> is an {{arbitrage trading}} strategy whereby an investor capitalizes on {{the interest rate}} differential between two countries. Unlike covered <b>interest</b> <b>arbitrage,</b> uncovered <b>interest</b> <b>arbitrage</b> involves no hedging of foreign exchange risk {{with the use of}} forward contracts or any other contract. The strategy involves risk, as an investor exposed to exchange rate fluctuations is speculating that exchange rates will remain favorable enough for arbitrage to be profitable. The opportunity to earn profits arises from the reality that the uncovered interest rate parity condition does not constantly hold - that is, the interest rate on investments in one country's currency does not always equal the interest rate on foreign-currency investments plus the rate of appreciation that is expected for the foreign currency relative to the domestic currency. When a discrepancy between these occurs, investors who are willing to take on risk will not be indifferent between the two possible locations of investment, and will invest in whichever currency is expected to offer a higher rate of return including currency exchange gains or losses (perhaps adjusted for a risk premium).|$|R

50|$|Economists Robert M. Dunn, Jr. and John H. Mutti {{note that}} {{financial}} markets may generate data inconsistent with interest rate parity, and that {{cases in which}} significant covered <b>interest</b> <b>arbitrage</b> profits appeared feasible were often due to assets not sharing the same perceptions of risk, the potential for double taxation due to differing policies, and investors' concerns over the imposition of foreign exchange controls cumbersome to the enforcement of forward contracts. Some covered <b>interest</b> <b>arbitrage</b> opportunities have appeared to exist when exchange rates and interest rates were collected for different periods; for example, the use of daily interest rates and daily closing exchange rates could render the illusion that arbitrage profits exist. Economists have suggested an array of other factors to account for observed deviations from interest rate parity, such as differing tax treatment, differing risks, government foreign exchange controls, supply or demand inelasticity, transaction costs, and time differentials between observing and executing arbitrage opportunities. Economists Jacob Frenkel and Richard M. Levich investigated the performance of covered <b>interest</b> <b>arbitrage</b> strategies during the 1970s' flexible exchange rate regime by examining transaction costs and differentials between observing and executing arbitrage opportunities. Using weekly data, they estimated transaction costs and evaluated their role in explaining deviations from interest rate parity and found that most deviations {{could be explained by}} transaction costs. However, accommodating transaction costs did not explain observed deviations from covered interest rate parity between treasury bills in the United States and United Kingdom. Frenkel and Levich found that executing such transactions resulted in only illusory opportunities for arbitrage profits, and that in each execution the mean percentage of profit decreased such that there was no statistically significant difference from zero profitability. Frenkel and Levich concluded that unexploited opportunities for profit do not exist in covered <b>interest</b> <b>arbitrage.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} currency {{competition from}} an information perspective. Transactions in traditional models do not convey information, so transaction costs [...] {{the driver of}} competition outcomes [...] are driven by market size. In our model transactions do convey information (consistent with recent empirical findings). Several important departures arise. First, adding the information dimension resolves the traditional indeterminacy of currency trade patterns (by mitigating the concentrating force of market-size economies). Second, whether transactions are executed directly or through a vehicle actually affects prices (because these trading methods do not in general reveal the same information). Third, our model provides a new rationale for why some currency pairs never trade directly (information is not sufficiently symmetric to support trading). Fourth, our model formalizes the arbitrage process and shows that <b>arbitrage</b> <b>transaction</b> quantities and price levels are jointly determined. Empirically, the paper provides a first integrated analysis of transactions in a triangle of markets: ¥/$, $/Euro, and ¥/Euro. Data for the full triangle permits comparison of direct, indirect and <b>arbitrage</b> <b>transactions,</b> for each pair. The information model predicts that transactions should affect prices across markets (e. g., flow in the ¥/$ market should convey information relevant to $/Euro and ¥/Euro prices), which is borne out. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} claim that the common finding of cointegration between spot and lagged forward {{exchange}} rates reflects the existence of covered <b>interest</b> <b>arbitrage</b> and not, as is generally accepted, long-run market efficiency. Breuer and Wohar's (1996) methodology is employed to match spot and one-month forward rates correctly for three major currencies; the Deutschmark, Sterling and the Yen, relative to the US dollar. Bi-variate analysis shows that spot and lagged forward rates are cointegrated with the vector (1,- 1), a necessary condition for market efficiency. However, at variance with theory, in a tri-variate VECM estimation, the spot rate, lagged forward rate and lagged interest rate differential are shown to be cointegrated with the vector (1,- 1, 1) for the Mark and Sterling. The 'cointegration' paradox is explained by investigating the relative magnitudes of the forecast error and the interest rate differential. It is demonstrated {{that it is impossible to}} distinguish between the influence of covered <b>interest</b> <b>arbitrage</b> and the existence of market efficiency using cointegration-based tests. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{issue of}} {{international}} tax arbitrage has proven {{a difficult and}} at times intractable one. Rather than try to minimize costs of the arbitrage or prevent “abuse” {{of the laws of}} a particular regime, the United States should also consider affirmatively bearing some of the costs of international tax arbitrage to further the policy of international vertical equity and transform the incentives that led to the current worldwide non-cooperative equilibrium, and thus the rise of international tax arbitrage, in the first place. Harnessing the costs of international tax <b>arbitrage</b> <b>transactions</b> will not always be the appropriate response to each particular <b>arbitrage</b> <b>transaction.</b> Harnessing the costs of the international tax arbitrage should be considered, however, when such responses prove inadequate.

At best, however, harnessing the costs of international tax arbitrage could place of the issue of international tax arbitrage back on the international scene, restart stalled international tax discussions and potentially move towards a greater worldwide consensus, not only on the international tax arbitrage itself but on the larger issue of the role of international vertical equity in the worldwide tax regime.

50|$|Covered <b>interest</b> <b>{{arbitrage}}</b> is an {{arbitrage trading}} strategy whereby an investor capitalizes on {{the interest rate}} differential between two countries by using a forward contract to cover (eliminate exposure to) exchange rate risk. Using forward contracts enables arbitrageurs such as individual investors or banks {{to make use of}} the forward premium (or discount) to earn a riskless profit from discrepancies between two countries' interest rates. The opportunity to earn riskless profits arises from the reality that the interest rate parity condition does not constantly hold. When spot and forward exchange rate markets are not in a state of equilibrium, investors will no longer be indifferent among the available interest rates in two countries and will invest in whichever currency offers a higher rate of return. Economists have discovered various factors which affect the occurrence of deviations from covered interest rate parity and the fleeting nature of covered <b>interest</b> <b>arbitrage</b> opportunities, such as differing characteristics of assets, varying frequencies of time series data, and the transaction costs associated with arbitrage trading strategies.|$|R
