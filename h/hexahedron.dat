5|$|Fez is a {{two-dimensional}} (2D) puzzle platform game {{set in a}} three-dimensional (3D) world. The player-character Gomez lives peacefully on a 2D plane until he receives a red fez and witnesses the breakup of a giant, golden <b>hexahedron</b> that tears the fabric of spacetime and reveals a third dimension. After the game appears to glitch, reset, and reboot, the player can rotate between four 2D views of the 3D world, as four sides around a cube-like space. This rotation mechanic reveals new paths through the levels by connecting otherwise inaccessible platforms, and {{is the basis of}} Fez puzzles. For example, floating platforms become a solid road, discontinuous ladders become whole, and platforms that move along a track stay on course. The object of the game is to collect cubes and cube fragments, which accrete to restore order to the universe. In search of these cubes, Gomez traverses the game environment by jumping between ledges. Other platforming elements change with the level themes, including crates that activate switches, bombs that reveal passages, and pistons that launch Gomez airborne.|$|E

At present plastering, whisker weaving and whisker weaving based plastering algorithm are available to perform such tasks.

This study shows that unstructured grids with structured elements can improve the aerodynamic flow computation by maintaining the grid size.

2500|$|The Platonic solids are {{prominent}} {{in the philosophy of}} Plato, their namesake. Plato wrote about them in the dialogue Timaeus 360 B.C. in which he associated each of the four classical elements (earth, air, water, and fire) with a regular solid. Earth was associated with the cube, air with the octahedron, water with the icosahedron, and fire with the tetrahedron. There was intuitive justification for these associations: the heat of fire feels sharp and stabbing (like little tetrahedra). Air is made of the octahedron; its minuscule components are so smooth that one can barely feel it. Water, the icosahedron, flows out of one's hand when picked up, as if it is made of tiny little balls. By contrast, a highly nonspherical solid, the <b>hexahedron</b> (cube) represents [...] "earth". These clumsy little solids cause dirt to crumble and break when picked up in stark difference to the smooth flow of water. Moreover, the cube's being the only regular solid that tessellates Euclidean space was believed to cause the solidity of the Earth.|$|E

30|$|The {{geological}} model was meshed using {{a set of}} triangular prism elements. A triangular prism has two triangular ends and three quadrangular sides. The triangular prism was selected instead of the more typical hexahedral mesh because the elevation of the strata in the Anjialing mine varies significantly in magnitude, and the nodes in a hexahedral mesh can give rise to relatively large displacements during the computing process. The displacements may result in extremely distorted elements and may cause computational problems.

The objective is to implicitly describe the immersed geometry with respect to the background mesh, whereas particular focus is on the possibility to handle arbitrarily complicated geometries. The key idea to be leveraged is, that any tetrahedron in the background mesh can be intersected by the immersed geometry at most through a plane (which is not the case, e.g., for <b>hexahedrons).</b> Furthermore, it is assumed, that in cases where a given tetrahedron is intersected in a pattern that does not exactly form such a cutting plane, it may be properly approximated, e.g., by best-fit techniques.
