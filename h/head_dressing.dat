60|$|Methinks I at {{this moment}} behold him in my imagination; or rather, I behold his goodly portrait, which still hangs in the family mansion of the Stuyvesants, arrayed in all the terrors of a true Dutch general. His regimental coat of German blue, gorgeously {{decorated}} with a goodly show of large brass buttons, reaching from his waistband to his chin; the voluminous skirts turned up at the corners, and separating gallantly behind, so as to display the seat of a sumptuous pair of brimstone-colored trunk-breeches, a graceful style still prevalent among the warriors of our day, and which is in conformity to the custom of ancient heroes, who scorned to defend themselves in rear. His face, rendered exceeding terrible and warlike {{by a pair of}} black mustachios; his hair strutting out on each side in stiffly pomatumed ear-locks, and descending in a rat-tail queue below his waist; a shining stock of black leather supporting his chin, and a little but fierce cocked hat, stuck with a gallant and fiery air over his left eye. Such was the chivalric port of Peter the Headstrong; and when he made a sudden halt, planted himself firmly on his solid supporter, with his wooden leg inlaid with silver a little in advance, in order to strengthen his position, his right hand grasping a gold-headed cane, his left resting upon the pummel of his sword, his <b>head</b> <b>dressing</b> spiritedly to the right, with a most appalling and hard-favored frown upon his brow, he presented altogether one of the most commanding, bitter-looking, and soldier-like figures that ever strutted upon canvas. Proceed we now to inquire the cause of this warlike preparation.|$|E

40|$|The {{study was}} {{designed}} to characterise the emergence from target-controlled anesthesia assessed by the recovery of spontaneous breathing, eye opening to command, and extubation in 18 adult patients undergoing intracranial surgery. Total intravenous anesthesia was induced and maintained with propofol and sufentanil. Target plasma concentration of propofol ranged between 3. 0 and 5. 5 micrograms. ml- 1 and infusion was stopped after <b>head</b> <b>dressing.</b> The initial target plasma sufentanil concentration of 0. 50 ng. ml- 1 was decreased to 0. 15 ng. ml- 1 after craniotomy; sufentanil infusion was discontinued at the dura closure. The time from the end of surgery (<b>head</b> <b>dressing)</b> to recovery of spontaneous breathing was 8. 3 +/- 6. 5 min, and the time to eye opening and extubation was 14. 7 +/- 10. 0 min. At the end of surgery, the calculated plasma propofol concentration was 3. 42 +/- 0. 26 micrograms. ml- 1. It significantly decreased to 2. 11 +/- 0. 51 micrograms. ml- 1 at recovery of spontaneous breathing and to 1. 81 +/- 0. 41 micrograms. ml- 1 at eye opening and extubation. The calculated plasma sufentanil concentration was 0. 108 +/- 0. 019 ng. ml- 1 at the end of surgery but did not change significantly between recovery of spontaneous breathing (0. 089 +/- 0. 013 ng. ml- 1), eye opening and extubation (0. 087 +/- 0. 013 ng. ml- 1). The calculated plasma propofol concentrations recorded at emergence were not correlated with patient age, total dose of propofol, and duration of infusion; corresponding calculated sufentanil concentrations were not correlated with age and total dose of sufentanil. An inverse relationship (p < 0. 05) was found between the duration of sufentanil infusion and the calculated sufentanil concentrations at emergence. No correlation was observed between calculated concentrations of propofol and sufentanil at emergence. Peer reviewe...|$|E
