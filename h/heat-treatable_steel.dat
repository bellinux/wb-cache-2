40|$|In this {{investigation}} an electron beam hardening (EBH) procedure {{was applied to}} <b>heat-treatable</b> <b>steel</b> 51 CrV 4 coated with Ti(1 -x) AlxN hard coatings, where x ranged from 0. 3 to 0. 6. The coatings with variable composition and mechanical properties were deposited by reactive magnetron sputter deposition. For electron beam surface hardening followed by hard coating deposition, the energy distribution within the energy transfer field caused a nearly constant hardening temperature on the treated material surface. Morphology, composition and mechanical properties of the coatings remained nearly unchanged, whereas the coating-substrate interface and the steel surface region were highly modified. Diffusion of interface-near coating elements into the substrate occurred and the corresponding region of the substrate showed clear changes in morphology and composition. These changes can be correlated with substantial improvements of the coating adhesion properties. Based on temperature measurements and calculations of electron penetration depths a plausible description of the observed effects was derived. The electron beam hardening caused a significant improvement of delamination resistance, especially for coatings with insufficient adhesion properties...|$|E
5000|$|This is the {{predecessor}} of all metal colouring typically {{employed in the}} firearms industry. Contemporary <b>heat-treatable</b> <b>steels</b> did not exist or were in their infancy. Soft, low-carbon steel was used, but strong materials were needed for the receivers of firearms. Initially case hardening was used but didn't offer any aesthetics. Colour case hardening occurs when soft steels were packed in a reasonably airtight crucible {{in a mixture of}} charred leather, bone charcoal and wood charcoal. This crucible was heated to [...] for up to 6 hours (the longer the heat was applied the thicker the case hardening). At the end of this heating process the crucible is removed from the oven and positioned over a bath of water with air forced through a perforated coil {{in the bottom of the}} bath. The bottom of the crucible is opened allowing the contents to drop into the rapidly bubbling water. The differential cooling causes patterns of colours to appear as well as hardening the part.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{importance}} of high-strength steel concepts for car bodies {{has increased in}} recent years due to the necessity of weight reduction and improved crash safety. By using hot stamping or also known as press hardening of boron alloyed <b>heat-treatable</b> <b>steels,</b> {{it is possible to}} produce parts with a much higher strength than by cold forming processes. Depending on the stress profile of a structural part, it might be desirable to have different material rigidity in the part, with some high strength and other more ductile areas, so called “Tailored properties”. There are a variety of methods to produce such parts, but all of these methods have currently still major challenges. Two methods to manufacture parts with tailored properties, these challenges and corresponding approaches are presented in this paper. This is on the one hand subsequently cooling in a spray field, which currently is still in the development phase because of challenges related to distortion. And on the other hand, the masked austenitization, which is used by only a few manufacturers {{due to the lack of}} experience, the impairments of coating condition and the great demands on the process management concerning re-cooling of the mask. Both variants are forward-looking and deliver high potential for further research...|$|R

40|$|Heat treatment, {{especially}} {{quenching and tempering}} often represent {{almost the}} final stage of manufacturing process in the production of machine components. Only the most exacting piece of work like grinding, polishing etc. follows. Final mechanical properties, such as residual stresses and hardness layer, therefore depend on optimum parameters of a quenching process and monitoring of the process itself. Even then happens that some work-pieces failed also due to cracking of the material. Detecting such faults in the due time may reduce unnecessary costs due to final machining of the machine part or even due to damage of the machine occurred due to machine part breakdown. The paper treats an experimental setup comprising detection of sound emission in the course of quenching process. Due to heat transfer from a specimen’s surface to a quenching medium, film boiling and nucleate boiling occur round a heated specimen, which strongly affects quenching.

40|$|The {{developments}} {{in the sphere of}} semiconductors have also led to a new generation of laser beam sources for processing methods for materials. The first High Power Diode Lasers (HDL) give very promising perspectives for the production technology due to their size, efficiency and the future trend in prices. Up until now there is no systematic knowledge concerning the technology of metalworking using HDL. The essay shows the technological advantages of a 650 W-HDL for laser processing methods for materials. First of all the characteristics of the existent 650 W-HDL source are discussed: On the one hand the dependence of laser power and laser beam quality upon currency and focussing optics {{and on the other hand}} the short and long term operating behaviour of the plant. The results of experimental research of laser hardening of a <b>heat-treatable</b> <b>steel</b> and laser welding of a stainless steel are presented and discussed. In the experiments the influence of feed rate, beam spot geometry and -foc us on the process results (geometry, hardness, texture) are analysed. The quality inspection of hardness and weld results are described by metallographic analysis methods (hardness test, analysis of texture). The essay will be completed by an outlook over the possibilities of using HDL in manufacturing...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: In the paper, {{influence}} of hydrogen on mechanical properties of welded joints from heat-treatable structural XABO 960 steel plates was investigated. Design/methodology/approach: The heat treatment of welded plate specimens was performed, {{and then the}} specimens were charged with hydrogen electrolytically generated from 1 N H 2 SO 4 solution. The following studies were carried out: static tensile test, hardness investigations, macroscopic metallographic investigations as well as investigations {{with the use of}} a scanning microscope. Findings: Hydrogen embrittlement of welded joints from XABO 960 steel plates was revealed by a distinct decrease of ductility and a slight decrease of strength. On the basis of metallographic investigations, it was found that in a fracture region there are fine pores created by the presence of hydrogen and its displacement due to formed stresses and plastic deformation. It was shown that welded joints are susceptible to hydrogen cracking in the heat affected zone and in the fusion zone. Research limitations/implications: TEM investigations on structure of the steel were predicted. Practical implications: The obtained results can be used for searching the appropriate way of improving the hydrogen embrittlement resistance of welded joints of the heat-treatable structural XABO 960 steel plates. Originality/value: The hydrogen embrittlement of welded joints of the <b>heat-treatable</b> XABO 960 <b>steel</b> plates was investigated...|$|R

The paper treats an experimental setup comprising detection of sound emission in the course of quenching process. Due to heat transfer from a specimen’s surface to a quenching medium, film boiling and nucleate boiling occur round a heated specimen, which strongly affects quenching. An investigation of sound emission in the quenching process was carried out with cylindrical specimens made of chrome-molybdenum <b>heat-treatable</b> <b>steel</b> 42 CrMo 4 quenched in different quenching media. Sound-pressure signals demonstrated by different amplitudes depending on time at different frequencies are shown in 3 D diagrams. It has turned out that an analysis of sound-emission signals can provide useful information that confirms differences occurring in quenching with different quenching media, different specimen’s shapes and under different quenching conditions. Analysis of sound emission signals can give useful information and confirm the differences caused by different quenching conditions. Analysis of the quenching results obtained from sound-emission signals during the quenching process can be confirmed by variations of residual stresses and hardness in the cross section. The results lead to the applicability of the new approach to the control of the hardening processes of steels. Keywords...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the results of {{combining}} Ti 1 − xAlxN coatings with a subsequent electron beam surface-hardening process. The coatings – differing in their chemical composition (Al = 17 … 30 at. %; Ti = 18 … 30 at. %) and thickness (1 – 6 μm) – were deposited by reactive magnetron sputtering onto the <b>heat-treatable</b> <b>steel</b> 51 CrV 4. During electron beam hardening (EBH), a special energy transfer field causes an isothermal surface temperature distribution. By varying energy input and interaction time, the resulting hardening depth could be adjusted in the range of 0. 1 to 0. 4 mm. The results are characterised by means of optical and scanning electron microscopy, hardness measurements and the evaluation of the chemical composition of the coatings by glow discharge optical spectroscopy. The load supporting capacity and the adhesion of the hard coatings was determined using scratch tests with increasing load. The chemical composition and thickness of the coatings applied by physical vapour deposition (PVD) significantly affected the results of subsequent EBH. Hardening depth increased with the increasing thickness and increasing Al content of the PVD layer. Furthermore, the coatings exhibited increasing resistance against thermal stress during EBH for decreasing layer thickness and increasing Ti content. Load support of the base material was improved by a factor of 2 to 3. Therefore, the duplex treatment PVD + EBH has a high potential for industrial application with respect to locally highly loaded components...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} materials of various types and characteristics used for gear production, depending on gear function procurement possibilities and available technology. The most used materials for gear box production are structural steel, <b>heat-treatable</b> <b>steel</b> and cementation steel. The effect of material quality and its properties on gears will be presented through calculation of gear load capacity, in cases when gears are made of cementation steel and heat-treateble steel. Besides requirements related to material quality there are also requirements posed for gears teeth quality. Choice of gear theeth quality, although has a large influence on load capacity, has {{to be related to}} costs, and also technical and technological production capacities. An influence of material quality and gear teeth quality presented in this paper will be analysed exclusively from gear load capacity aspect. Key words: quality of materials, quality of gear teeth, gear load capacity. 1.

40|$|This {{research}} project describes models for an engineering initial crack fatigue life calculation of surface strengthened components {{based on the}} local concept. The influence of different material properties in the surface layer and in the core, macro residual stresses and surface fine structure is acquired. In the experimental part of the {{research project}}, fatigue strength tests were carried out on unnotched and notched axially loaded specimens for three combinations of surface strengthening methods and base material: shot peening and nitriding of the <b>heat-treatable</b> <b>steel</b> 42 CrMo 4 and nitrocarburation of the unalloyed steel Ck 15. Strain controlled single-stage tests of untreated specimens, hardness and residual stress measurements as well as FE analyses served to determine the input data for the numerical models. With the combinations of the base materials and surface strengthening methods under investigation, the local concept permits an engineering estimation of initial crack component fatigue life {{within the range of}} high and low failure load cycle numbers with good hit accuracy. The change of the failure point and the profile of the stress-number and fatigue life lines for surface and core initial cracks is mapped. In the concept presented here, S/N lines for surface strengthened components are already a result of the calculations. The instrument presented here provides a capability of making a comparative assessment of variants of surface strengthened components as early as during the design phase with regard to their operational strength.
