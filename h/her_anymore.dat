500|$|Biographer Karen Hollinger {{described}} the early 1990s as {{a downturn in}} the popularity of Streep's films, attributing this partly to a critical perception that her comedies had been an attempt to convey a lighter image following several serious but commercially unsuccessful dramas, and more significantly {{to the lack of}} options available to an actress in her forties. Streep commented that she had limited her options by her preference to work in Los Angeles, close to her family, a situation that she had anticipated in a 1981 interview when she commented, [...] "By the time an actress hits her mid-forties, no one's interested in <b>her</b> <b>anymore.</b> And if you want to fit a couple of babies into that schedule as well, you've got to pick your parts with great care." [...] At the Screen Actor's Guild National Women's Conference in 1990, Streep keynoted the first national event, emphasizing the decline in women's work opportunities, pay parity, and role models within the film industry. She criticized the film industry for downplaying the importance of women both on screen and off.|$|E
500|$|The name of [...] "Anna Howard Shaw Day" [...] {{is based}} on Liz's hatred of Valentine's Day, for which she {{substitutes}} [...] "Anna Howard Shaw Day", a fictional holiday celebrating the real February 14 birthday of Woman's Civil Rights leader Anna Howard Shaw. Liz tells Jack {{that she does not}} watch CNBC, a business news channel, but that she gets all her money advice from a fictitious cartoon character, Foxy Moneybags, on PBS. While confronting him, Jenna asks Maynard if the dog who gives him his orders has died, a reference to the Son of Sam killer allegedly being commanded to kill by a neighbour's possessed dog. As he does not stalk <b>her</b> <b>anymore,</b> Jenna asks Maynard if he is stalking [...] "one of those kids from Glee", the latter being a Fox program that focuses on a high school show choir. During his appearance on The Hot Box, Avery asks Jack what his favorite movie is with him responding that it is a tie with The Fountainhead (1949) and Uncle Buck (1989). During her hallucination, in which she sees Drew, Dennis, and Floyd, Liz confesses to Dennis that watching the period drama The Color Purple with him drunk [...] "was one of the funnest nights of my life." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{scene in}} which Sephiroth kills Aerith during Final Fantasy VII has also {{prompted}} much commentary. For example, when comparing him with Cloud, ScrewAttack noted that with this scene, Sephiroth was established as [...] "the biggest bastard." [...] GamesRadar simply called him [...] "the biggest cock blocker in the gaming world," [...] as writer Shane Patterson found Aerith's character to be appealing, and {{due to the fact}} Sephiroth killed her, players were unable to use <b>her</b> <b>anymore.</b> Also referring to the scene as a shocking moment, GameSpot suggested that the FMV sequence of Sephiroth appearing in front of the Nibelheim fire [...] "might {{be one of the most}} recognizable cutscenes ever to grace video games." [...] GamesRadar's article [...] "Non-playable characters we wish were playable" [...] featured Sephiroth as a character that they wished would have been playable in Final Fantasy VII so they [...] "could relive skewering Aerith like an annoyingly dainty, needlessly chaste salmon over and over." [...] IGN put Sephiroth in the 2009 articles [...] "Big Boss of the Day" [...] and [...] "Baddie Brawl", with the latter comparing him with Liquid Snake from Metal Gear Solid. Lisa Foiles of The Escapist included Sephiroth on her 2014 list of top five katana wielders.|$|E

[...] Regine was shattered by his rejection of her, and was unwilling to accept Kierkegaard's breaking of their engagement, threatening to kill herself if he did not take her back. [...] Kierkegaard attempted to quell her interest, he later wrote, [...] "there was nothing else for me to do but to venture to the uttermost, to support her, if possible, by means of deception, to do everything to repel her from me in order to rekindle her pride." [...] He wrote her cold, calculated letters {{in order to make it}} seem that he didn't love <b>her</b> <b>anymore,</b> but Regine clung to the hope that they would get back together, desperately pleading to him to take her back. [...] On October 11, 1841, Kierkegaard met with her and again broke off the engagement in person. [...] Her father tried to persuade him to reconsider after assessing Regine's desperate condition, claiming that [...] "It will be the death of her; she is in total despair" [...] Kierkegaard returned the next day and spoke with Regine. To her query as to whether he would ever marry, Kierkegaard icily responded: [...] "Well, yes, in ten years, when I have begun to simmer down and I need a lusty young miss to rejuvenate me." [...] In reality, Kierkegaard had no such plans, and would remain a celibate bachelor for the rest of his life.|$|E

2500|$|Gibb met Scottish {{pop singer}} Lulu through Colin Petersen. Lulu recalls about Maurice, [...] "I thought Maurice was cute, so I said, 'In that case, {{tell him to}} stop talking about me and take me out', He did just that, I never {{expected}} much to come from this, but in fact our relationship grew, after a fashion. Going steady is quite {{the wrong way to}} describe what was happening between us. Going unsteady might better sum up the way we fell in and out with each other". According to Lulu, she, Maurice and Robert Stigwood watched Pink Floyd at the Saville Theatre in London. Later, after his relationship with Lulu had become public knowledge, he said: [...] "Lulu and I met on the Top of the Pops TV show three months ago, and then at the Saville Theatre in London last month". Later in 1968, Lulu was seen out on the town with Davy Jones of The Monkees, Jones was also a friend of Maurice's. As Gibb recalled, [...] "Davy Jones was a good friend of mine, I broke it off with Lulu over the phone and Davy called me up and said 'I am going to ask Lu to dinner with some friends, is that all right?' I said, 'Yes, I am not going out with <b>her</b> <b>anymore,</b> have a ball' and threw the phone down. They then took so many photos of them and made it look like a six-month romance, but she had only been out with him that one night, she did not even want to go out. She phoned me the next day and she was crying, saying she was sorry". Maurice later regretted not accepting her apology, [...] "We just grew up, that's all," [...] Maurice admitted. [...] "We were miserable apart and when we started going out again, it got so that I didn't want to be with anyone. I used to phone her up from Los Angeles about twice a day. Then she'd call me back. We used to make about 90 minute calls".|$|E

This prompts Lucky to be gentler about his anger, and to stop drinking before suffering a serious relapse. Jackson explained: [...] "The crisis that's going on with Elizabeth, the fact that Cam and Jake don't have a mother right now, I think that sort of wakes Lucky up to say, 'I need to get my stuff together because I need to be present for those kids.'" [...] Elizabeth gives birth to Aiden, and they believe Nikolas to be the father due to Helena tampering with the DNA test. Aiden is kidnapped by Franco, forcing Lucky to work together with Nikolas, which starts to repair their relationship.
