500|$|It is debated by some whether Bringing Up Baby is {{the first}} fictional work (apart from pornography) {{to use the word}} gay in a {{homosexual}} context. In one scene, Cary Grant's character is wearing a woman's marabou-trimmed négligée; when asked why, he replies exasperatedly [...] "Because <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> gay all of a sudden!" [...] (leaping into the air at the word gay). As the term gay did not become familiar to the general public until the Stonewall riots in 1969, it is debated whether the word was used here in its original sense (meaning [...] "happy") or is an intentional, joking reference to homosexuality.|$|E
500|$|The filming {{was done}} rather discreetly, fearing {{opposition}} against the film's underlying {{subject matter of}} homosexuality. Among the crew members, only a core group {{were aware of the}} details of the plot, and {{to the rest of the}} crew it was a road trip film, one identical to Dil Chahta Hai (2001). During the filming of a scene where Pandit kisses Ganesh in the outdoors, the crew members were taken aback as most of them were unaware of any romantic involvement among the two lead characters. Pandit especially found the rape scene difficult to shoot, because of the emotional weight that it carried: [...] "What I did to overcome my revulsion was to not stand judgment over my character Jai's action. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> with how Jai reacted to the given situation." ...|$|E

500|$|This {{was quickly}} {{followed}} by [...] "Third Day of a Seven Day Binge". Manson {{said that the}} recording of the album [...] "just became a rhythm. This was something I was excited to do." [...] This is {{in stark contrast to}} the recording of The High End of Low (2009) and Born Villain, when he was frequently [...] "dragged into the studio" [...] late at night to record vocals. He credited this enthusiasm to the collaborative process between him and Bates, saying that he realized after the first performance of [...] "Birds of Hell Awaiting" [...] that [...] " [...] just sang it. I didn't even know where the music was going to go and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> with it and it was very organic. And then it opened up a whole different part of my mind." ...|$|E
500|$|Patrick Duffy, {{who would}} play Pamela's {{on-screen}} love, knew the part was ideal for Principal {{the minute he}} set his eyes on her. He recalled {{that one of the}} finalists for Pamela [...] "was a remarkably talented young actress from New York... really good. , in walked Victoria Principal with the tightest jeans I've ever seen and the most unbelievable blouse. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>went,</b> 'Hello, Pam'. I knew {{she was going to be}} Pam Ewing." [...] Producer Michael Filerman (Knots Landing and Falcon Crest) offered insight, [...] "Principal really wanted that role...and worked very hard to get it. And there's a humanity about her that's just winning. And the camera likes her very much. The camera just loves her. That's real important." [...] During the pilot filming, Principal became very close with teenaged actress Charlene Tilton, who played Lucy Ewing. Principal explained that [...] "the location shooting was hard on Tilton, who was only seventeen and had never been away from home".|$|E
500|$|In an interview, Jennings {{recalled}} the restrictions of the Nashville establishment: [...] "They wouldn't {{let you do}} anything. You had to dress a certain way: {{you had to do}} everything a certain way.... They kept trying to destroy me.... <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> about my business and did things my way.... You start messing with my music, I get mean." [...] By 1972, after the release of Ladies Love Outlaws, his recording contract was nearing an end. Sick with hepatitis, Jennings was hospitalized. Afflicted by disease, and the music industry, he was considering retirement. Albright visited him and convinced him to continue. Albright talked to him about making Neil Reshen his new manager. Meanwhile, Jennings requested a US$25,000 royalty advance from RCA Records to cover his living expenses during his recovery. The same day he met Rashen, RCA sent Jerry Bradley to offer Jennings US$5,000 as a bonus for signing a new 5% royalty deal with RCA, the same terms he had accepted in 1965. After reviewing with Reshen, he rejected the offer and hired Reshen.|$|E

500|$|... "Rude Boy" [...] was {{produced}} by Rob Swire and StarGate who co-wrote the song with Rihanna, Ester Dean, and Makeba Riddick. During an interview on the television show, [...] in February 2010, Carr asked Rihanna about the song's lyrics, with particular emphasis on the line [...] "Come here Rude Boy, Boy, can you get it up?/Come here Rude Boy, Boy, is you big enough?" [...] Rihanna explained: [...] "When we wrote the song, {{it was kind of}} a freestyle...I liked the West Indian influence that the music had, and, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> in the booth, they were already jotting down some ideas and, that came to me, I just ran in there with the, one of the writers and started coming up with this in the studio and now when people read it back to me like that, 'Come here Rude Boy, is you big enough'?, it does sound so disgusting!" [...] She also explained the development of the song, and said that those lyrics were originally going to be the introduction, but because of the song's infectious beat, Rihanna decided to make it the hook instead.|$|E
500|$|Christie {{commented that}} [...] "people didn't do scenes {{like that in}} those days", and that she found the scenes {{difficult}} to film: [...] "There were no available examples, no role models ... <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> blank and Nic [...] shouted instructions." [...] The scene caused problems with censors {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic. [...] The American censor advised Nicolas Roeg explicitly, saying, [...] "We cannot see humping. We cannot see the rise and fall between thighs." [...] The scene's much celebrated fragmented style, in which scenes of the couple having sexual intercourse are intercut with scenes of the couple post-coitally getting dressed to go out to dinner, partly came about through Roeg's attempt to accommodate the concerns of the censors: [...] "They scrutinised it and found absolutely nothing they could object to. If someone goes up, you cut and the next time you see them they're in a different position, you obviously fill in the gaps for yourself. But, technically speaking, there was no 'humping' in that scene." [...] In the end, Roeg only cut nine frames from the sequence, and the film was awarded an R rating in the United States. In Britain, the British Board of Film Classification judged the uncut version to be [...] "tasteful and integral to the plot", and a scene in which Donald Sutherland's character can be clearly seen performing oral sex on Christie's character was permitted, but it was still given an X rating—an adults only certificate.|$|E
500|$|... "One Wonderful Day" [...] also {{introduced}} the second-season mystery surrounding Betty Applewhite (Alfre Woodard) and Matthew Applewhite (Mehcad Brooks). Cherry revealed, [...] "they {{come on the}} street; they seem like nice people — but they've got a secret. And it's pretty gothic. It's real and human and awful {{all at the same}} time." [...] Another scene featuring the Applewhite family, in which Betty brings food to a prisoner in their basement, was cut from this episode but was used in the second season premiere, [...] "Next". Cherry's inspiration for the Lynette storyline came from his own childhood experience when his mother returned to work. He commented: [...] "The predicament of any working woman is that you can love your career, but there is something... to be said for getting to stay home every day with your kids, and you don't want anyone else to be better at it than you are. Felicity Huffman expressed satisfaction with how her storyline was handled, explaining that Lynette [...] "didn't deal with [...] in the most straightforward way, but she was fighting for her family. They were noble motives." [...] While discussing the courtroom scene in which Carlos attacks John, Ricardo Antonio Chavira commented: [...] "People can see the full rage that is in my character. I'm yelling at him, 'I'm gonna kill you'... Then I broke into Spanish: [...] "Yo voy a matar!"... <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> for it... Then I looked, and Jesse [...] had the most honest look of sheer terror. I think I scared the living shit out of him." ...|$|E

500|$|In the EuroBasket 2005, Nowitzki {{came back}} strong. He {{surprisingly}} led a depleted German squad into the Finals, beating title favorites Slovenia in the quarter-finals and Spain in the semi-finals on the way. EuroBasket pundits praised Nowitzki in both matches: against Slovenia (76–62), the forward scored a game high 22 points and commented: [...] "The Slovenians underestimated us. They {{said we were}} the team they wanted and that was wrong, you shouldn't {{do that in the}} quarter-finals." [...] Against Spain (74–73), Nowitzki scored a game-high 27 points and scored the decisive basket: down by one and with only a few seconds to go, he drove on Spanish forward Jorge Garbajosa, and hit a baseline jump shot over Garbajosa's outstretched arms with 3.9 seconds to go. The German later commented: [...] "It was indescribable. Garbajosa kind of pushed me towards the baseline so <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> with it." [...] Despite losing the Finals, 78–62, to the Greeks, Nowitzki was the tournament's leading scorer (26.7 per game) and second-leading rebounder (10.8 per game) and shot blocker (1.8 per game), and was voted Most Valuable Player of the tournament. When he was subbed out {{towards the end of the}} final, Nowitzki received standing ovation from the crowd, which he later recalled as [...] "one of the best moments of [...] career". In the 2006 FIBA World Championship, Nowitzki led the German team to an eighth place and commented: [...] "It's tough luck. But overall, finishing eighth in the world is not bad." ...|$|E
500|$|The caravan {{park was}} largely empty at the time, and closed for winter {{several days after}} filming ended. Both actors and crew slept in the same caravan in which the film was set. Ryder later commented on the extreme cold and the crowded nature of the caravan, which had eight people inside it during filming; he {{felt that it was}} [...] "quite hectic but [...] a great atmosphere". Throughout filming, Hoyle and Ryder {{remained}} in character, improvising their scenes around a basic narrative structure rather than using a script. Hoyle told a reporter that they [...] "wanted everything to feel like real time... As soon as you woke up, the cameras would be on you. I look knackered." [...] During filming, he contracted swine flu, but insisted that all he needed was a 30-minute break before filming, attributing his ability to continue acting to adrenaline. He noted that [...] "I just said, 'No, no, no. We'll carry on. I'll just stop eating.' I was completely purged during the making of that film. Afterwards, during the edit, I started to feel a lot calmer." [...] Hoyle felt that the process of making the film had been cathartic, noting that [...] "When I was 14, I had– let's call it an existential crisis. I wondered if [...] was a case of me destroying that part of me. If you do have a breakdown that young, {{for the rest of your}} life you're very aware of it. It can make you feel your foundations are a little bit shaky. It's a devastating experience but we revisited it. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> with my instincts and intuition." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Rod Smallwood, the band's manager, {{the brief}} given to Derek Riggs (the group's then regular artist) was, unlike with {{previous}} albums, to create [...] "simply something surreal and bloody weird".

[...] Debut artists included Garrett Lebeau, folkrock duo Trout Fishing in America, Steve Poltz, Rebecca Loebe, Griffin House, Tim Easton, Otis Gibbs, young Oklahomans Parker Millsap and Levi Parham, and others. [...] Lebeau said: “To me, Woody Guthrie is this person {{who wanted to}} write about things from people’s perspective … just normal people. And that’s who I write tunes for.” [...] Ezra Idlet, one-half of the duo Trout Fishing in America said: [...] "Two years ago, I had the time off and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> (to WoodyFest)....just went and watched — and I was knocked out by the caliber of performers, the camaraderie between the musicians and the presenters." ...|$|E
2500|$|Speaking to Rolling Stone {{magazine}} in early 1979, {{by which time}} he and Arias were married and {{the parents of a}} newborn son, Dhani, Harrison further acknowledged Arias' positive influence on his life when discussing the despondency behind his Dark Horse song [...] "Simply Shady": [...] "I wasn't ready to join Alcoholics Anonymous or anything – I don't think I was that far gone – but I could put back a bottle of brandy occasionally, plus all the other naughty things that fly around. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> on a binge... Then I met Olivia and it all worked out fine." [...] Other Harrison love songs dedicated to Arias include [...] "Dark Sweet Lady" [...] and [...] "Your Love Is Forever", both released on the 1979 album George Harrison.|$|E
2500|$|Paul Weitz {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the story of Grandma long before he began writing the script. He never completed the story until he had met and worked with Tomlin on the 2013 film Admission, saying that [...] "After meeting Lily, the voice and the character really clicked, I had thought about it for years, so I had a lot of it worked out in my head, and then <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> to a coffee shop and wrote it longhand." [...] He said that, as he wrote, he could hear her [...] "performing it in [...] head". After writing the script, he was afraid to present it to Tomlin in case she turned down the lead role. Tomlin said that she immediately connected with the character and the story; she and Weitz then spent several months editing the script together. The film marked Tomlin's first leading role in 27 years, after co-starring with Bette Midler in the 1988 comedy film Big Business.|$|E

[...] "It's almost like a formulated temper tantrum over aimless things. Try and find the dead target on that song and I'll shake your hand, because I really don't know. It might take a psychologist or something. It's a temper tantrum, really, put to music." ...|$|R
