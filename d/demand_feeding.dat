5000|$|In 1984, Anne Marie Ezzo wrote a four-page paper titled [...] "Parent Controlled Feeding". In 1985, Ezzo {{received}} his Master of Arts degree from Talbot; the degree emphasized Christian Education. Subsequently, the Ezzos continued to research early parenting and with five other couples formed Growing Families International (GFI), beginning as a non-profit in 1987 {{and becoming a}} for-profit in 1989. Based on the earlier paper the Ezzos wrote a Christian parenting guide for GFI: Preparation for Parenting: Bringing God's Order to Your Baby's Day and Restful Sleep to Your Baby's Night. The book was published in 1990. Grace Community Church was initially supportive of the Ezzos and their parenting ministry but in 1997 {{after four years of}} concerned discussion, the church reversed its official position, criticizing the Ezzos for creating a divisive atmosphere between parents who followed the book's practices and those who favored <b>demand</b> <b>feeding</b> for infants, sleeping with their infants, and sling-type carriers for babies. The church elders banned the GFI books for [...] "stifling the mother's desire to comfort her children", for ascribing Biblical qualities to the concept of scheduled feeding, and for failing to address the church's concerns regarding theological issues such as human depravity (the belief that all people are born in slavery to the service of sin) and regeneration (the belief that people can experience spiritual rebirth in Christ). The Ezzos left the church along with a few sympathetic families.|$|E

40|$|Livestock <b>feed</b> <b>demand</b> is a {{collection}} of derived <b>feed</b> <b>demands</b> by various livestock categories. A structural understanding of <b>demand</b> for <b>feed</b> grains and total concentrates requires knowledge of separate <b>feed</b> <b>demand</b> relationships for each major livestock cate-gory. While a number of aggregate livestock <b>feed</b> <b>demand</b> relationships have been estimated, {{little is known about the}} structure of <b>feed</b> <b>demand</b> by livestock type. In this study unique livestock <b>feed</b> <b>demand</b> relationships for <b>feed</b> grains and total concentrates are estimated for each of seven major livestock categories. The estimated relationships show substantial differences in elasticities of concentrate and <b>feed</b> grain <b>feed</b> <b>demand</b> with respect to feed prices and with respect to livestock price across livestock groups. Using <b>feed</b> <b>demand</b> parameters by livestock category enables analysts to evaluate policy effects of changes in <b>feed</b> <b>demand</b> quantities and <b>feed</b> costs within the livestock economy, as well as to provide more reliable estimates of the total change in <b>feed</b> <b>demand.</b> The <b>demand</b> for <b>feed</b> grains and other feed concentrates is {{a collection}} of demands by various livestock categories.

40|$|AIM: Maternal {{disease can}} cause {{prematurity}} and neonatal complications, notably feeding problems. To determine {{the relationship between}} maternal disease and the nature and severity of neonatal feeding problems, we compared feeding profiles, time to <b>demand</b> <b>feeding</b> and length of hospital stay between preterm infants of preeclamptic mothers, mothers with amniotic infection and mothers with other disease causing prematurity. METHODS: The retrospective study used labour ward data collected from 2002 to 2005 in a tertiary university centre to analyse three groups of singletons born at < 32 completed gestational weeks to mothers with preeclampsia (n = 61), amniotic infection (n = 55) and non-preeclamptic non-amniotic infection controls (n = 55). The groups were similar in gestational age, birthweight and sex ratio; all infants received enteral feeding according to departmental guidelines. Feeding profiles and enteral/oral nutrition were compared. RESULTS: Feeding problems occurred in 46 % of the preeclamptic group, 11 % of the amniotic infection group and 13 % of controls. Full oral <b>demand</b> <b>feeding</b> was established at 36 0 / 7 weeks postmenstrual age, 35 3 / 7 weeks (P = 0. 03) and 35 2 / 7 weeks (P < 0. 0001), respectively. Feeding problems were {{the main cause of}} delay (7 - 10 days) in hospital discharge in the preeclamptic group (P = 0. 0002).

40|$|In general, <b>demand</b> <b>feeding</b> {{devices are}} {{equipped}} with a mechanical trigger switch. Such a switch is not suitable for juvenile fish with a small body size, because the body weight is insufficient to trigger the feeder. An infrared light sensor that {{does not require the}} fish to push a feeder switch is more suitable for small fish. The brown-marbled grouper Epinephelus fuscoguttatus is an important fish species in Southeast Asia. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the growth rates (GRs) of brown-marbled grouper juveniles reared using customised <b>demand</b> <b>feeding</b> devices with an infrared light sensor (the infrared light demand feeder (IRDF) group) and automatic feeding devices (the automatic feeder (AF) group). The results indicated that GRs of standard lengths and body weights showed no significant differences using one-way analysis of variance; however, the standard length of the IRDF group showed a tendency of a higher GR than the AF group. Although the feed conversion ratio (FCR) also showed no significant difference, the FCR of the IRDF group was more efficient, indicating that the IRDF group yielded a more desirable FCR. These results indicate that IRDF can be used in the culture of brown-marbled grouper juveniles. In view of the working schedule of the fish farm staff, IRDF are superior to other feeding devices, because they are less labour-intensive than usual tasks. We conclude that IRDF is a useful feeding system for aquaculture...|$|E

40|$|Very young {{children}} with chronic kidney disease often have difficulty maintaining adequate nutrition, which contributes to the high prevalence of short stature in this population. Characteristics of the dialysis prescription and supplemental feeding via a nasogastric (NG) tube or gastrostomy may improve growth, {{but this is not}} well understood. Here, we analyzed data from 153 children in 18 countries who commenced chronic peritoneal dialysis at < 24 months of age. From diagnosis to last observation, 57 patients were fed on demand, 54 by NG tube, and 10 by gastrostomy; 26 switched from NG to gastrostomy; and 6 returned from NG to <b>demand</b> <b>feeding.</b> North American and European centers accounted for nearly all feeding by gastrostomy. Standardized body mass index (BMI) uniformly decreased during periods of <b>demand</b> <b>feeding</b> and increased during NG and gastrostomy feeding. Changes in BMI demonstrated significant regional variation: 26 % of North American children were obese and 50 % of Turkish children were malnourished at last observation (P < 0. 005). Body length decreased sharply during the first 6 to 12 months of life and then tended to stabilize. Time fed by gastrostomy significantly associated with higher lengths over time (P < 0. 001), but adjustment for baseline length attenuated this effect. In addition, the use of biocompatible peritoneal dialysate and administration of growth hormone independently associated with improved length, even after adjusting for regional factors. In summary, growth and nutritional status vary regionally in very {{young children}} treated with chronic peritoneal dialysis.

50|$|The {{demand for}} {{agricultural}} products is fixed for every region and every time-step. The drivers of agricultural demand are: time, income and population growth. Total demand is composed of: food <b>demand,</b> material <b>demand,</b> <b>feed</b> <b>demand</b> and seed demand. Food demand depends on food energy demand, and the share of crop and livestock products in the diet. Within livestock products, the share of different products (Ruminant meat, chicken meat, other meat, milk, eggs) is fixed at 1995 levels. The same is valid for the share of crops within total food calories and material demand. The share of livestock products in the total consumed food calories is an important driver for the land-use sector. Different statistical models are used to estimate plausible future scenarios. A calibration is used to reach the livestock shares of the Food Balance Sheets for 1995 for each region.|$|R

A fasted state is not guaranteed in the general human population. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine if fed animals would exhibit a different metabolic profile in response to hemorrhagic shock with trauma when compared to fasted animals. Proton (1 H) NMR spectroscopy was used to determine concentrations of metabolites from four different compartments (liver, muscle, serum, urine) taken at defined time points throughout shock/injury and resuscitation. PLS-DA was performed and VIP lists established for baseline, shock and resuscitation (10 metabolites for each compartment at each time interval) on metabolomics data from surviving animals. Fed status prior to the occurrence of hemorrhagic shock with injury alters the metabolic course of this trauma and potentially affects mortality. The death rate for CPF animals is higher than FS animals (47 vs 28 %). The majority of deaths occur post-resuscitation suggesting reperfusion injury. The metabolomics response to shock reflects priorities evident at baseline. FS animals raise the baseline degree of proteolysis to provide additional amino acids for energy production while CPF animals rely on both glucose and, to a lesser extent, amino acids.

N. M. C., Belgaum. By random sampling, 380 rural mothers and 400 urban mothers having 1 -year-old child were selected. Information on sociodemographic variables, breast feeding practices was recorded. Results: In the present study, majority of urban (65. 00 %) as well as rural mothers (64. 21 %) were between 20 and 24 {{years of age and}} were literates (90. 25 and 77. 89 %, respectively). Majority of the mothers in both urban and rural areas gave prelacteal feeds (54. 25 and 57. 11 %, respectively). Many mothers in both rural and urban areas discarded the colostrum, (14. 75 % in urban vs 25. 79 % in rural).

40|$|Introduction: There is no {{significant}} difference between NFHS II &III with respect to under- nutrition data but Gross national income has increased many times, so poverty and unavailability of food alone cannot be the only reasons of under- nutrition. Under-nutrition is the result of many interrelated factors such as poverty, insufficient household food security, inadequate health services, poor maternal and child care practices and inadequate water and sanitation. For communities with a high prevalence of under- nutrition, it may take years or even decades before all of these factors can be addressed. Aims and Objectives:  to find out child feeding practices responsible for severe acute malnutrition among Under-five Children and to recommend a Community Action Plan based on Positive Deviance Approach to deal with under-nutrition quickly, affordably and sustainably in a culturally acceptable manner. Materials & Methods : Study design : Matched Case Control study. Sample size : 143 cases and age, socio-economic status matched 143 controls. Study place : MTC and Immunization clinic. Study Duration: May, 2013 - May, 2014. Study Tool and Data Collection : Semi-structured pre-tested questionnaire. Data analysis: with help of SPSS 16 (Mean, SD, Proportion, odds ratio). Results: Strong positive association was found between duration of exclusive breast feeding(both shorter and longer), prelacteals, diluted milk as weaning food, bottle feeding, giving excess milk and less solid protein diet, not able to recognize cue of hunger by mother, lack of <b>demand</b> <b>feeding,</b> and severe acute malnutrition. Conclusion : Not any nutritional programme can help in preventing SAM unless we motivate the mothers for good child feeding and rearing practices. This can be achieved by identification of the Positive Deviant mothers from the same community and SES, who can motivate the mothers of SAM children and can practically demonstrate positive child feeding practices in a culturally acceptable manner. </p...|$|E
40|$|In 1974 the Department of Health and Social Security {{alerted the}} medical {{profession}} {{and the general public}} to the problems associated with the prevailing high levels of artificial feeding. As a result a campaign to promote breast feeding was initiated. This thesis reviews the history of infant feeding and the implications of the change from breast to bottle feeding. A survey of infant feeding practice was undertaken in a health district during 1977. The results showed that although sixty percent of the mothers attempted to breast feed less than half were successful. The mothers were subsequently interviewed and it was found that their choice of feeding method was either decided before, or very early in pregnancy, and that they did not necessarily seek professional advice. Those that did were most often advised by a health visitor or midwife at a clinic, antenatal class, or with pamphlets. Mothers from the manual social groups showed the greatest need for advice and were the least likely to find the classes or written material appealing. Failure of lactation was thought to be due to an insufficient milk supply and occurred during the first six weeks of the infant's life. Health visitors and midwives in district were asked for their views on the relative merits of breast and artificial feeding and the problems of establishing lactation. There was a consensus of opinion in favour of encouraging breast feeding, but a divergence on how to promote successful lactation. The concept of frequent <b>demand</b> <b>feeding</b> was not always accepted and complementary feeding was also advocated. Additionally there were differing views on the energy and fluid intake required by lactating mothers all of which resulted in some mothers receiving confusing or inappropriate advice...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction This paper reviews {{recent trends}} in the production, supply and price of the active {{ingredients}} as well as finished ACT products. Production and cost data provided in this paper are based on an ongoing project (Artepal). Stability data are derived from a development project on rectal artesunate. Discussion The artemisinin raw material and its derivatives appear to be very stable compared to the finished products. Supply of artemisinin changed in May 2004 when the Global Fund shifted financial support to qualified countries from chloroquine or sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine to an ACT for treatment of malaria. First, {{there was a sudden}} shortage of the starting material, and short term scarcity led to a steep rise in API price: it increased dramatically in 2004, from $ 350 per kg to more than $ 1000. Second, there was a parallel {{increase in the number of}} companies extracting artemisinin from 10 to 80 between 2003 and 2005 in China, and from 3 to 20 in Vietnam. Commercial cultivation began also in East Africa and Madagascar. A steady and predictable demand for the crop can eliminate such wide fluctuations and indirectly contribute to price stability of the herb, the API and ACT. With appropriate mechanisms to reduce those fluctuations, the cost of artemisinin might decrease sustainably to US$ 250 – 300 per kg. Conclusion Today the global health community is facing the risk of another cyclical swing with lower <b>demand</b> <b>feeding</b> into reduced planting of A. annua and, thereafter, a new shortage of the raw material and higher API prices. International donors, the largest purchasers for ACTs could better coordinate their activities, in order to guarantee purchase of ACTs and consequently of API with manufacturers. In parallel, the base of quality producers of APIs and finished ACT products needs to be broadened. While the ACT programme is still in its early stages, the consequences of another wave of artemisinin and ACT shortages would permanently discredit it and impede any progress in rolling malaria back. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} two decades, the use of grain to feed {{livestock}} in China has increased rapidly. A {{number of studies have}} examined demand and supply of grain for animal feed in China. Forecasts have been made. Generally, these projections {{have turned out to be}} well wide of the actual supply and demand. Further, forecasts of supply and <b>demand</b> for <b>feed</b> grains for the same time periods have differed greatly. Accurate forecasts of variables affecting supply and demand benefit both producers and consumers. Past forecasts of supply and <b>demand</b> of <b>feed</b> grain for livestock production in China are reviewed and reasons for discrepancies between projections are explored. Ways to improve projections of demand for and supply of grain for livestock feed in China are identified. Copyright (c) 2008 International Association of Agricultural Economists. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The paper {{argues that}} current {{long-term}} projections of global meat and <b>feed</b> <b>demand</b> may underestimate future consumption patterns for mainly two reasons. First, {{they do not}} explicitly consider increased demand for protein foods of animal origin with rising incomes in some developing contries, and second they do not allow for changes in livestock technology, in particular <b>feed</b> <b>demand.</b> We then project the impact of both mechanisms to show the empirical relevance of our comments and suggest ready-to-use tools to consider them within standard projection models...|$|R
