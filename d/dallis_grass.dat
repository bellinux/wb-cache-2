50|$|Claviceps {{includes}} about 50 known species, {{mostly in}} the tropical regions. Economically significant species include C. purpurea (parasitic on grasses and cereals), C. fusiformis (on pearl millet, buffel grass), C. paspali (on <b>dallis</b> <b>grass),</b> C. africana (on sorghum), and C. lutea (on paspalum). C. purpurea most commonly affects outcrossing species such as rye (its most common host), as well as triticale, wheat and barley. It affects oats only rarely.|$|E
40|$|Full-length coding {{sequences}} of the beta-tubulin gene (tubA) were PCR-amplified and sequenced from 42 Phaeosphaeria isolates, including, 16 P. nodorum and 23 P. avenaria species from cereals, two Polish isolates from rye (Secale cereale L.), and one isolate from <b>dallis</b> <b>grass</b> (Paspalum dilatatum Poir). A tubA gene of size 1556 bp was identified in wheat- and barley-biotype P. nodorum (PN-w and PN-b), P. avenaria f. sp. avenaria (Paa), homothallic P. avenaria f. sp. triticea (P. a. t.) (Pat 1) and the P. a. t. isolate (Pat 3) from the State of Washington. The tubA gene length polymorphisms were detected in two P. a. t. isolates (Pat 2) from foxtail barley (Hordeum jubatum L.), one from <b>dallis</b> <b>grass</b> and two Polish isolates from rye. These size differences {{were due to}} the variation of intron lengths among these three Phaeosphaeria species. All Phaeosphaeria isolates have identical 1344 bp exons that can be translated into a 447 amino acid P-tubulin. Like glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase, the P-tubulin amino acid sequence was identical in all Phaeosphaeria species used in this study, {{with the exception of}} the two Pat 2 isolates. Six amino acid differences were evident in the P-tubulin of these Pat 2 isolates. (c) 2005 Federation of European Microbiological Societies. Published by Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|In a {{study of}} small Subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU-rRNA) gene {{sequences}} in cereal and a grass Phaeosphaeria species, group I introns were found in 9 of 10 P. avenaria f. sp. avenaria (Paa) isolates from oat (Avena saliva L.), I of 2 Phaeosphaeria sp. (P-rye) isolates (Sn 48 - 1) from Polish rye (Secale cereale L.), I Phaeosphaeria sp. (P-dg) isolate (S- 93 - 48) from <b>dallis</b> <b>grass</b> (Paspalum dilatatum Poir.) and both heterothallic P a. f. sp. triticea (Pat 2) isolates (ATCC 26370 and ATCC 26377) from foxtail barley (Hordeum jubatum L.). There were no group I introns in wheat- and barley-biotype P. nodorum (PN-w and PN-b), homothallic P a. f. sp. triticea (Patl) and P a. f. sp. triticea (Pat 3) {{from the state of}} Washington. Based on the reference 16 S rDNA nucleotide sequence of Escherichia coli (accession number J 01695), the intron-inserted positions of Pav. nS 943, Pse. nS 943, Ppa. nS 1199 and Pho. nS 1533 were determined to be at nt 943, nt 943, nt 1199 and nt 1533, respectively. The sizes of the introns were 362 bp for Pav. nS 943 (from Paa), 363 bp for Pse. nS 943 (from P-rye), 460 bp for Pho. nS 1533 (from Pat 2) and 383 bp for Ppa. nS 1199 (P-dg). The intron-inserted position at nt 1533 found in SSU-rRNA of Pat 2 pathogen was newly discovered. The phylogenetic relationships based on aligned conserved secondary structure component sequences of group I introns showed that three introns from cereal Phaeosphaeria species (Pav. nS 943, Pse. nS 943 and Pho. nS 1533) were likely affiliated with subgroup IC 1 introns while Ppa. nS 1199 intron from the <b>dallis</b> <b>grass</b> pathogen belonged to Subgroup IE 3...|$|E

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} on the relation between ingestive behaviour of grazing goats and tropical grasses. Three goats fitted with oesophageal fistulae were used for measuring dry matter intake per bite (DMI/TB) from <b>Dallis</b> <b>grass</b> (Paspalum dilatatum) and Bermuda grass (Cynodon dactylon) pastures at 59 and 80 days of regrowth. Whole plants, harvested parts of plants by goats, un harvested parts of the plants from each pasture were collected for chemical analyses and determination of in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) and energy. Digestible dry matter intake per bite (DDMI/TB) and digestible energy intake per bite (DEI/TB) were estimated. The results obtained were as follows: Harvested parts by goats showed higher crude protein, IVDMD and digestible energy, however lower cell wall constituents than those of unharvested parts at two growth stages in both species. Goats had larger DMI/TB at 80 days of regrowth comparing with 59 days, however DDMI/TB and DEI/TB showed little differences between two stages in both grasses. There was no differences between grasses in DMI/TB, DDMI/TB and DEI/TB at both stages. 暖地型イネ科牧草草種(ダリスグラス及びバミューダグラス) と山羊の採食行動との関連について,食道フィステル装着山羊 3 頭を供試し,採食部と残食部の化学成分,in vitro乾物消化率及び可消化エネルギー並びにひと噛み当たりの乾物摂取量,可消化乾物摂取量及び可消化エネルギー摂取量を指標として検討した. 得られた結果は次のとおりである. 供試ダリスグラス及びバミューダグラスの採食部の粗蛋白質含量, in vitro乾物消化率及び可消化エネルギーは残食部のそれらと比べ高い値を示し,採食部の細胞壁構成成分含量は残食部のそれと比べ概して低い値を示した. また,ダリスグラス及びバミューダグラス草地における山羊のひと噛み当たりの乾物摂取量は再生 59 日目よりも 80 日目で高い値を示したが,いずれの時期においても両草種間でほとんど差は認められなかった. さらに,ひと噛み当たりの可消化乾物摂取量及び可消化エネルギー摂取量は両生育段階及び草種間で大きな差は認められなかった...|$|E
40|$|Phaeosphaeria {{species are}} {{important}} causal agents of Stagonospora leaf blotch diseases in cereals. In this study, the nucleotide sequence and deduced polypeptide of the trifunctional histidine biosynthesis gene (his) {{are used to}} investigate the phylogenetic relationships and provide molecular identification among cereal Phaeosphaeria species. The full-length sequences of the his gene were obtained by PCR amplification and compared among cereal Phaeosphaeria species. The coding sequence of the his gene in wheat-biotype P. nodorum (PN-w) was 2697 bp. The his genes in barley-biotype P. nodorum (PN-b), two P. avenaria f. sp. triticea isolates (homothallic Pat 1 and Pat 3), and Phaeosphaeria species from Polish rye and <b>dallis</b> <b>grass</b> were 2694 bp. The his gene in heterothallic isolate Pat 2, however, was 2693 bp because the intron had one fewer base. In P. avenaria f. sp. avenaria (Paa), the his gene was only 2670 bp long. The differences {{in the size of}} the his gene contributed to the variation in amino acid sequences in the gap region located between the phosphoribosyl-ATP pyrophosphohydrolase and histidinol dehydrogenase sub-domains. Based on nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the his gene, Pat 1 was not closely related to either PN-w or the Paa clade. It appears that rates of evolution of the his gene were fast in cereal Phaeosphaeria species. The possible involvement of meiotic recombination in genetic diversity of the his gene in P. nodorum is discussed...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to analyze the accumulation of digestible materials from digestible materials present in forage and new photosynthates and to analyze the decrease in dry matter digestibility with growth of two tropical grasses, using the following two equations. 1 /W * dD/dt = {(1 D + dW/dt) *(dD/dt) }*(D + dW/dt) /W, (A) D_ 1 /W_ 1 - D_ 2 /W_ 2 = (1 - W_ 1 /W_ 2) *(D_ 1 /W_ 1 - ARD/RGBw), (B) where W = dry weight of forage (W_ 1 ≠ W_ 2), D = dry weight of digestible materials (D_ 1 ≠ D_ 2), dW/dt = new photosynthates, (D+dW/dt) = amount of source materials [S] for D accumulation, (1 /W). (dD/dt) = accumulation rate of D per unit W [ARD], (1 /(D+dW/dt)) · (dD/dt) = accumulation rate of D per unit S [ARDS], (D+dW/dt) /W = the ratio of S to W [S ratio], RGRw = mean relative growth rate of forage, (1 -W_ 1 /W_ 2) = forage growth index [FG index], (D_ 1 /W_ 1 - ARD/RGRw) = index for the decrease in dry matter partition into digestible materials [DDMPD index], D_ 1 /W_ 1 - D_ 2 /W_ 2 = the decrease in dry matter digestibility [DDMD]. Two equations were applied to <b>dallis</b> <b>grass</b> (Dg) and bermuda grass (Bg) cut at 20, 59 and 80 days of regrowth. Each attribute in two equations was given a bar on it to show mean value over the 1 st interval of 39 days and over the 2 nd interval of 21 days, respectively. The following results were obtained: 1. Dg: Higher ARD in the 1 st interval compared to the 2 nd interval was due to higher ARDS in the 1 st interval. Similar DDMD between two intervals was due to the offset effect between FG index and DDMPD index. 2. Bg: Lower ARD in the 1 st interval than in the 2 nd interval was due to lower ARDS in the 1 st interval. The larger DDMD in the 1 st interval compared to the 2 nd interval was due to higher DDMPD index in the 1 st interval. 3. 1 st interval: Higher ARD in Dg than in Bg was mainly due to higher ARDS in Dg. Almost the same DDMD between Dg and Bg was due to the offset effect between FG index and DDMPD index. 4. 2 nd interval: Lower ARD in Dg than in Bg was due to lower ARDS in Dg. The larger DDMD in Dg compared to Bg was due to higher DDMP index in Dg. It was suggested that the proposed method gave macro analyses of the accumulation of digestible materials and the decrease in dry matter digestibility with growth of tropical grasses...|$|E
