5|$|Because the feats the Baron {{describes}} are overtly implausible, {{they are}} easily recognizable as fiction, {{with a strong}} implication that the Baron is a liar. Whether he expects his audience to believe him varies from version to version; in Raspe's original 1785 text, he simply narrates his stories without further comment, but in the later extended versions he is insistent that he is telling the truth. In any case, the Baron appears to believe <b>every</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> his own stories, no matter how internally inconsistent they become, and he usually appears tolerantly indifferent to any disbelief he encounters in others.|$|E
5|$|In September 1847 Busch began {{studying}} {{mechanical engineering at}} Hanover Polytechnic. Busch's biographers are not in agreement as to why his Hanover education ended; most believe {{that his father had}} little appreciation of his son's artistic inclination. Biographer Eva Weissweiler suspects that Kleine played a major role, and that other possible causes were Busch's friendship with an innkeeper, Brümmer, political debates in Brümmer's tavern, and Busch's reluctance to believe <b>every</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> the Bible and catechism.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Zeffirelli, whose Hamlet was heavily cut, Kenneth Branagh adapted, directed, {{and starred in}} a 1996 version containing <b>every</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> Shakespeare's play, combining the material from the F1 and Q2 texts. Branagh's Hamlet runs for just over four hours. Branagh set the film with late 19th-century costuming and furnishings, a production in many ways reminiscent of a Russian novel of the time; and Blenheim Palace, built in the early 18th century, became Elsinore Castle in the external scenes. The film is structured as an epic and makes frequent use of flashbacks to highlight elements not made explicit in the play: Hamlet's sexual relationship with Kate Winslet's Ophelia, for example, or his childhood affection for Yorick (played by Ken Dodd).|$|E

25|$|Kabbalah (Jewish mysticism) uses {{a series}} of kavanot, {{directions}} of intent, to specify the path the prayer ascends in the dialog with God, to increase its chances of being answered favorably. Kabbalists ascribe a higher meaning {{to the purpose of}} prayer, which is no less than affecting the very fabric of reality itself, restructuring and repairing the universe in a real fashion. In this view, <b>every</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> every prayer, and indeed, even every letter of every word, has a precise meaning and a precise effect. Prayers thus literally affect the mystical forces of the universe, and repair the fabric of creation.|$|E
25|$|Alonso Quixano, {{the protagonist}} of the novel (though he is not given this name until much later in the book), is a Hidalgo (member of the lesser Spanish nobility), nearing 50 years of age, living in an unnamed section of La Mancha with his niece and housekeeper, {{as well as a}} boy who is never heard of again after the first chapter. Although Quixano is usually a {{rational}} man, in keeping with the humoral theory of the time, not sleeping adequately — because he was reading — has caused his brain to dry; Quixano's temperament is thus choleric, the hot and dry humor. As a result, he is easily given to anger and believes <b>every</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> these fictional books of chivalry to be true.|$|E
25|$|Orthodox and Conservative {{branches}} of Judaism accept these texts {{as the basis}} for all subsequent halakha and codes of Jewish law, which are held to be normative. Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism deny that these texts, or the Torah itself for that matter, may be used for determining normative law (laws accepted as binding) but accept them as the authentic and only Jewish version for understanding the Torah and its development throughout history. Humanistic Judaism holds that the Torah is a historical, political, and sociological text, but does not believe that <b>every</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> the Torah is true, or even morally correct. Humanistic Judaism is willing to question the Torah and to disagree with it, believing that the entire Jewish experience, not just the Torah, should be the source for Jewish behavior and ethics.|$|E

25|$|Each hour of {{this day}} is the new {{suffering}} and the new effort of the expiatory suffering of the Savior. And the echo of this suffering is already heard in <b>every</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> our worship service – unique and incomparable both {{in the power of}} tenderness and feeling and in the depth of the boundless compassion for the suffering of the Savior. The Holy Church opens before the eyes of believers a full picture of the redeeming suffering of the Lord beginning with the bloody sweat in the Garden of Gethsemane up to the crucifixion on Golgotha. Taking us back through the past centuries in thought, the Holy Church brings us {{to the foot of the}} cross of Christ erected on Golgotha, and makes us present among the quivering spectators of all the torture of the Savior.|$|E

500|$|The {{producers}} {{chose to}} present the Muppet Mr. Snuffleupagus ("Snuffy") and his family's experience of divorce. The episode was written by staff writer Norman Stiles, who also wrote the 1983 episode in which Mr. Hooper's death was explained. <b>Every</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> the divorce episode was reviewed by the Children's Television Workshop's (CTW) advisory board, content experts, and developmental psychologists. After tests showed that their young viewers were confused by the episode and did not understand important concepts about divorce, the producers decided to not air it, despite the investment they had made. It {{was the first time}} the show's producers made this kind of decision, and was cited as an example of the producer's practice of [...] "listening to the voices of children and by putting their needs first", despite the costs.|$|E
500|$|The {{friendship}} and professional association lasted {{for more than}} fifty years, {{until the end of}} Richardson's life. Gielgud's other roles in this season were Lord Trinket in The Jealous Wife, Richard II again, Antony in Antony and Cleopatra, Malvolio in Twelfth Night, Sergius in Arms and the Man, Benedick in Much Ado About Nothing – another role for which he became celebrated – and he concluded the season as King Lear. His performance divided opinion. The Times commented, [...] "It is a mountain of a part, {{and at the end of}} the evening the peak remains unscaled"; in The Manchester Guardian, however, Brown wrote that Gielgud [...] "is a match for the thunder, and at length takes the Dover road with a broken tranquillity that allowed <b>every</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> the King's agony to be clear as well as poignant." ...|$|E
500|$|Geisel's {{drawings}} {{formed a}} part of the narrative, bordering on the blending of text and image found in the much-denigrated comics medium. The artwork in children's literature before Geisel's appearance was much more restrained than Geisel's, and relegated to a lower status than the text it illustrated. By linking text and image, the book helps children follow the story even if they cannot read <b>every</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> the text. By encouraging children to explore the page, the drawings allow them to use their imaginations to fill in gaps in the text. The details shown in the pictures but not explained in the text creates a tension between them that leads the reader to think and imagine further. In the case of Mulberry Street, Philip Nel writes, readers might be moved to ask questions such as [...] "Why is the elephant blue?" [...] or [...] "Where did the airplane come from?" ...|$|E

500|$|The Beagle {{reached the}} Cape of Good Hope on 31 May. In Cape Town Darwin {{received}} a letter dated 29 December from his sister Caroline telling him that his fame was spreading. On 18 November 1835 Sedgwick had read extracts from Darwin's geological notes to the Geological Society of London, and this had been reported in The Athenæum on 21 November. On 25 December their father {{received a letter}} from Henslow which said that Darwin would become one of the premier naturalists of the time, and enclosed some copies of a book of extracts of Darwin's letters on South American geology which had been printed for private distribution. Their father [...] "did not move from his seat till he had read <b>every</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> your book & he was very much gratified – he liked so much the simple clear way you gave your information". Darwin was horrified that his careless words were in print, but No hay remedio (it can't be helped). He explored the geology of the area, reaching conclusions about slate formation and the injection of granite seams as liquid which differed from the ideas of Lyell and Sedgwick. The zoologist Andrew Smith showed him formations, and later discussed the large animals living on sparse vegetation, showing that a lack of luxuriant vegetation did not explain the extinction of the giant creatures in South America.|$|E
500|$|Two Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur, Patricia Hussey and Barbara Ferraro (no {{relation}} to Geraldine Ferraro), did not recant from their pro-choice positions. [...] Hussey and Ferraro, {{directors of the}} Covenant House in Charleston, West Virginia—a shelter for homeless and abused women and children—were supported by CFFC in their dispute with the Church. [...] By March 1986, Hussey and Ferraro were no longer calling for [...] "dialogue" [...] but were publicly demanding recognition of [...] "a woman's right to choose." [...] In July 1986 when the two nuns were pressured more strongly with expulsion, 11 of the other nuns who signed came forward with a statement in solidarity with them, denying a recent Vatican announcement that all nuns but Hussey and Ferraro were now aligned with the Church's position on abortion. The eleven complained of the Church's divisive tactics, which they said were intended to isolate Hussey and Ferraro. Signer Maureen Fiedler said, [...] "I have never retracted or recanted one syllable of the Catholic Statement on Abortion and Pluralism. I continue to stand behind <b>every</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> it without the slightest reservation." [...] After nearly four years of dispute, Hussey and Ferraro were informed by their order's leadership in June 1988 {{that they would not}} be dismissed from the order. However, the leadership of the School Sisters of Notre Dame distanced the order from Hussey and Ferraro, calling them [...] "intransigent" [...] and stating that they [...] "have in practice placed themselves outside the life and mission of the congregation." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:-This paper {{proposes a}} multi-classified and self-directed {{learning}} method used for sign language recognition, which adopts statistical template matching methods to recognize sign language. As sign language expressions consist of many frames, SIFT algorithm {{is used to}} position key frames and eigenvectors of sign language vocabulary. According to these key frames, the hierarchical discriminate regression (HDR) method is adopted to narrow the searching scope. Then, these obtained features are compared and matched with <b>every</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> sign language in the dynamic time warping (DTW) scope. The recognition rate of this method is 85 %, which is higher than HMM under the same condition. This could greatly speed up the construction process of a sign language database.
