5|$|The medieval {{settlement}} Brezalauspurc (literally: Braslav's castle) {{is sometimes}} attributed to Bratislava, {{but the actual}} location of Brezalauspurc is under scholarly debate. The city's modern name is credited to Pavel Jozef Šafárik's misinterpretation of Braslav as Bratislav in his analysis if mediaeval sources, which led him to <b>invent</b> <b>the</b> term Břetislaw, which later became later Bratislav.|$|E
5|$|The summit, {{which is}} the {{collapsed}} dome of an ancient volcano, features the ruins of an observatory which was continuously staffed between 1883 and 1904. The meteorological data collected during this period are still important for understanding Scottish mountain weather. C. T. R. Wilson was inspired to <b>invent</b> <b>the</b> cloud chamber after a period spent working at the observatory.|$|E
5|$|Theobald Boehm did not {{directly}} <b>invent</b> <b>the</b> key system of the clarinet. Boehm was a flautist who created the key system that is now used for the transverse flute. Klosé and Buffet applied Boehm's system to the clarinet. Although the credit goes to those people, Boehm's name was given to that key system because {{it was based on}} that used for flute.|$|E

5|$|Armillary sphere, hydraulic-powered: Hipparchus (c. 190– c. 120 BC) {{credited}} the Ancient Greek mathematician, geographer, astronomer, {{and poet}} Eratosthenes (276–194 BC) {{as the first}} to <b>invent</b> <b>the</b> armillary sphere representing the celestial sphere. However, the Chinese astronomer Geng Shouchang of the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) invented it separately in China in 52 BC, while the Han dynasty polymath Zhang Heng (78–139 AD) {{was the first to}} apply motive power to the rotating armillary sphere by a set of complex gears rotated by a waterwheel which in turn was powered by the constant pressure head of an inflow clepsydra clock, the latter of which he improved with an extra compensating tank between the reservoir and the inflow vessel.|$|E
5|$|Experimentation by Faraday in 1831 {{revealed}} that a wire moving perpendicular to a magnetic field developed a potential difference between its ends. Further analysis of this process, known as electromagnetic induction, enabled him to state the principle, now known as Faraday's law of induction, that the potential difference induced in a closed circuit {{is proportional to the}} rate of change of magnetic flux through the loop. Exploitation of this discovery enabled him to <b>invent</b> <b>the</b> first electrical generator in 1831, in which he converted the mechanical energy of a rotating copper disc to electrical energy. Faraday's disc was inefficient and of no use as a practical generator, but it showed the possibility of generating electric power using magnetism, a possibility that would be taken up by those that followed on from his work.|$|E
5|$|Li Shizhen (1518–93) – one of {{the most}} renowned pharmacologists and {{physicians}} in Chinese history – belonged to the late Ming period. His Bencao Gangmu is a medical text with 1,892 entries, each entry with its own name called a gang. The mu in the title refers to the synonyms of each name. Inoculation, although it can be traced to earlier Chinese folk medicine, was detailed in Chinese texts by the sixteenth century. Throughout the Ming dynasty, around fifty texts were published on the treatment of smallpox. In regards to oral hygiene, the ancient Egyptians had a primitive toothbrush of a twig frayed at the end, but the Chinese were the first to <b>invent</b> <b>the</b> modern bristle toothbrush in 1498, although it used stiff pig hair.|$|E

5|$|Peel {{worked with}} one of his weavers, James Hargreaves, to {{investigate}} new technologies. In 1762, Peel and Hargreaves set up a carding machine, but decided against using it. When Hargreaves went on to <b>invent</b> <b>the</b> spinning jenny in 1764, Peel was keen to use the technology. He set them up in his factory at Stanhill where Hargreaves worked. In the spring of 1768, the spinning jennies at Peel's factory were blamed for job losses. The factories and Hargreaves' nearby house were the targets of a riot, destroying the spinning jennies within– along with some of Peel's own inventions. In reaction, Peel moved his manufacturing away from Lancashire. He decided on Burton-upon-Trent where he built three mills, including cutting a canal for one.|$|E
5|$|The {{judge said}} there were three crucial points, in no {{particular}} order. Did the jury believe Julie Mugford or Jeremy Bamber? Were they sure that Sheila was not the killer who then committed suicide? He said this question involved another: was the second, fatal, shot fired at Sheila with the silencer on? If yes, {{she could not have}} fired it. Finally, did Nevill call Bamber {{in the middle of the}} night? If there was no such call, it undermined the entirety of Bamber's story; the only reason he would have had to <b>invent</b> <b>the</b> phone call was that he was responsible for the murders.|$|E
5|$|The {{works of}} American author Edgar Allan Poe (January 19, 1809– October 7, 1849) include many poems, short stories, and one novel. His fiction spans {{multiple}} genres, including horror fiction, adventure, science fiction, and detective fiction, a genre he {{is credited with}} inventing. These works are generally {{considered part of the}} Dark romanticism movement, a literary reaction to Transcendentalism. Poe's writing reflects his literary theories: he disagreed with didacticism and allegory. Meaning in literature, he said in his criticism, should be an undercurrent just beneath the surface; works whose meanings are too obvious cease to be art. Poe pursued originality in his works, and disliked proverbs. He often included elements of popular pseudosciences such as phrenology and physiognomy. His most recurring themes deal with questions of death, including its physical signs, the effects of decomposition, concerns of premature burial, the reanimation of the dead, and mourning. Though known as a masterly practitioner of Gothic fiction, Poe did not <b>invent</b> <b>the</b> genre; he was following a long-standing popular tradition.|$|E

50|$|In 1655 Boreel {{assisted}} in the controversy over {{trying to figure out}} who <b>invented</b> <b>the</b> telescope. He had a local magistrate in Middelburg in the Netherlands follow up on his recollection of a spectacle maker who told Boreel in 1610 about <b>inventing</b> <b>the</b> telescope. The magistrate was contacted by a then unknown claimant, Middelburg spectacle maker Johannes Zachariassen, who testified that his father, Zacharias Janssen <b>invented</b> <b>the</b> telescope and the microscope as early as 1590. This testimony seemed to convincing to Boreel, who now recollected that Zacharias must have been who he remembered. Boreel's conclusion that Zacharias Janssen <b>invented</b> <b>the</b> telescope a little ahead of another spectacle maker, Hans Lippershey, was adopted by Pierre Borel in his 1656 book on the subject.|$|R

25|$|The Church did not <b>invent</b> <b>the</b> idea of {{witchcraft}} as a potentially harmful force whose practitioners {{should be put}} to death.
