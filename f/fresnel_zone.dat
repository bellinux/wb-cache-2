50|$|<b>Fresnel</b> <b>zone</b> antennas are {{reflector}} antennas {{that focus}} the signal {{by using the}} phase shifting property of the antenna surface, rather than its shape. There are three type of <b>Fresnel</b> <b>zone</b> antennas, namely, <b>Fresnel</b> <b>zone</b> plate, offset Fresnel zoneplate antennas and phase correcting reflective array or “Reflectarray” antennas. They are a class of diffractive antennas and have been used from radio frequencies to X rays.|$|E

50|$|This {{effect can}} be best {{understood}} using the <b>Fresnel</b> <b>zone</b> concept. The circular object blocks {{a certain number of}} Fresnel zones. The <b>Fresnel</b> <b>zone</b> that begins with the edge of the circular object {{is the only one that}} contributes to the Arago spot. All the Fresnel zones that are further out destructively interfere with each other and thus cancel. Random edge corrugation whose amplitude is of the same order as the width of that adjacent <b>Fresnel</b> <b>zone</b> reduces the Arago spot intensity. Contributions from the parts of the edge whose radius has been increased by the corrugation to about the width of the adjacent <b>Fresnel</b> <b>zone</b> now destructively interfere with those contributions from the parts which have not been affected by the corrugation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fresnel</b> <b>zone</b> antennas {{belong to}} the {{category}} of reflector and lens antennas. Unlike traditional reflector and lens antennas, however, the focusing effect in a <b>Fresnel</b> <b>zone</b> antenna is achieved by controlling the phase shifting property of the surface and allows for flat or arbitrary antenna shapes. For historical reasons, a flat <b>Fresnel</b> <b>zone</b> antenna is termed a Fresnel zoneplate antenna. An offset Fresnel zoneplate can be flush mounted to the wall or roof of a building, printed on a window, or made conformal {{to the body of}} a vehicle.|$|E

40|$|Results of Tindle and Guthrie, Felsen {{and other}} authors on {{studying}} {{the relationship between}} ray and mode representations of a field in a range-independent waveguide are used to describe wave scattering in a waveguide with large-scaled random inhomogeneities of refractive index. The notion of <b>Fresnel</b> <b>zones</b> for modes is introduced, which {{is analogous to the}} usual <b>Fresnel</b> <b>zones</b> introduced for rays. Using the <b>Fresnel</b> <b>zones</b> for modes one can simplify the analysis of mode scattering at large-scaled inhomogeneities in waveguides. Simple formulae to calculate fluctuations of mode amplitudes are obtained. They are quite similar to the well known formulae of geometrical optics and those of the Rytov method.

50|$|Fresnel {{zones are}} seen in optics, radio communications, electrodynamics, seismology, acoustics, {{gravitational}} radiation, and other situations involving the radiation of waves and multipath propagation. <b>Fresnel</b> <b>zone</b> computations are used to anticipate obstacle clearances required when designing highly directive systems such as microwave parabolic antenna systems. Although intuitively, line-of-sight between transmitter and receiver seems to be all that is required for a strong antenna system, due to the complex nature of radio waves, obstructions within the first <b>Fresnel</b> <b>zone</b> can cause significant weakness, even if those obstructions are not blocking the line-of-sight signal path. For this reason, it is valuable to do a calculation {{of the size of}} the 1st, or primary, <b>Fresnel</b> <b>zone</b> for a given antenna system. Doing this will enable the antenna installer to decide if an obstacle, such as a tree, is going to make a significant impact on signal strength. The rule of thumb is that the primary <b>Fresnel</b> <b>zone</b> would ideally be 80% clear of obstacles, but must be at least 60% clear.|$|E
40|$|Theory {{predicts that}} a plane wave {{scattered}} {{by a thin}} slab of gas yields, in the forward direction and under specific circumstances, a larger irradiance than would be observed {{in the absence of}} the gas. This enhanced Rayleigh scattering depends on the size of the <b>Fresnel</b> <b>zones</b> at the slab location, as seen from the observer's position, and results from the coherence of the scattering. On astronomical scales the exceptional size of <b>Fresnel</b> <b>zones</b> (~ 1500 km) has particular relevance when considering forward-scattered starlight by an interstellar cloud of atomic hydrogen.

40|$|Ray {{perturbation}} theory and dynamic ray tracing both describe the behaviour of seismic rays near a reference ray. The equations of dynamic ray tracing relate changes in position {{and direction of}} a ray {{in the vicinity of}} a reference ray (paraxial ray) to changes in the reference ray’s initial conditions. Ray {{perturbation theory}} relates changes in paraxial rays to changes in the slowness ¢eld or the reference ray’s endpoints. Dynamic ray tracing is performed in ray-centred coordinates, whereas ray perturbation theory may be performed in either ray-centred coordinates or in an external reference frame. Both methods derive from asymptotic ray theory, but their developments have proceeded along largely independent paths. In this paper we explore the relationship between dynamic ray tracing and ray perturbation theory and outline an e⁄cient scheme, based on ray perturbation theory, to compute approximate <b>Fresnel</b> <b>zones</b> in inhomogeneous media. Key words: dynamic ray tracing, <b>Fresnel</b> <b>zones,</b> inhomogeneous media, ray perturbation theory. ...|$|R

50|$|Originally from amateur radio, {{the phrase}} {{was used to}} {{describe}} the way an FM transmitter will cut in and out as it nears the capture threshold of a moving receiver or transmitter as it passes through <b>fresnel</b> <b>zones,</b> thus chopping the speech of the transmitting operator.

50|$|Although {{radio waves}} {{generally}} travel {{in a straight}} line, fog and even humidity can cause some of the signal in certain frequencies to scatter or bend before reaching the receiver. This means that objects that are clear {{of the line of}} sight path will still potentially block parts of the signal. To maximize signal strength, one needs to minimize the effect of obstruction loss by removing obstacles from both the direct radio frequency line of sight (RF LoS) line and also the area around it within the primary <b>Fresnel</b> <b>Zone.</b> The strongest signals are on the direct line between transmitter and receiver and always lie in the first <b>Fresnel</b> <b>zone.</b>|$|E

However, recent studies show that indirect reflected signals contain some useful scientific data. GPS reflected signals introduce a new and exciting way of doing ocean and land remote sensing, and have even more advantages over traditional remote sensing tools. This project discusses the basic principles and theory of this new technology, and concentrates on reflection points and <b>Fresnel</b> <b>zones.</b> The GPS receivers are placed at different coastal regions within South Africa, and the simulation of the reflection points and <b>Fresnel</b> <b>zones</b> are observed as the GPS satellites pass over South Africa.

Areas of the <b>Fresnel</b> <b>zones</b> reaching a maximum of about 6500 km 2 were observed at different receiver heights and the software to make these simulations was written using the IDL language. Results shows that this new tool of remote sensing is feasible and has potential to be used in South Africa. The uses for this new tool include ocean altimetry, ocean, land, ice sheet remote sensing etc. 3 Acknowledgments It is {{with a great deal of}} pleasure that I acknowledge my heartfelt thanks and gratitude to my supervisor, Prof. Mike Inggs for his support, encourage-ment and guidance throughout my research.
