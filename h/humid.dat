5|$|Hilton Head Island has a <b>humid</b> {{subtropical}} climate.|$|E
5|$|Montreal is {{classified}} as a <b>humid</b> continental climate (Köppen climate classification: Dfa/Dfb).|$|E
5|$|Plymouth's {{climate is}} a {{transitional}} <b>humid</b> continental/cold <b>humid</b> subtropical/marine type, {{which is the}} predominant climate for Massachusetts. Due to its location on the Atlantic Ocean, humidity levels can be very high year-round. Plymouth's coastal location causes it to experience warmer temperatures than many inland locations in New England. Summers are typically hot and <b>humid,</b> while winters are cold, windy and often snowy.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific coast {{features}} a <b>humid</b> subtropical climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot, <b>humid</b> summers {{because of the}} southeast seasonal wind. The Ryukyu Islands have a subtropical climate, with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is very heavy, especially during the rainy season.|$|E
5|$|The {{commonly}} used Köppen climate classification system has five broad groups (<b>humid</b> tropics, arid, <b>humid</b> middle latitudes, continental and cold polar), which are further divided into more specific subtypes. The Köppen system rates regions of terrain based on observed temperature and precipitation.|$|E
5|$|The <b>humid</b> {{subtropical}} climate zone where winter rainfall (and sometimes snowfall) {{is associated with}} large storms that the westerlies steer from west to east. Most summer rainfall occurs during thunderstorms and from occasional tropical cyclones. <b>Humid</b> {{subtropical climate}}s lie {{on the east side}} of continents, roughly between latitudes 20° and 40° degrees away from the equator.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{is in the}} {{northern}} part of the <b>humid</b> subtropical climate zone (Köppen: Cfa) However, under the Trewartha climate classification, the city has a temperate maritime climate (Do). Winters are usually chilly with light snow, and summers are hot and <b>humid.</b> The District is in plant hardiness zone 8a near downtown, and zone 7b elsewhere in the city, indicating a <b>humid</b> subtropical climate.|$|E
5|$|Lord Howe Island has a {{subtropical}} climate. Under the Köppen climate classification, Lord Howe Island has a <b>Humid</b> {{subtropical climate}} (Cfa).|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma is in a <b>humid</b> {{subtropical}} region. Oklahoma lies in {{a transition}} zone between <b>humid</b> continental climate to the north, semi-arid climate to the west, and <b>humid</b> subtropical climate in the central, south and eastern portions of the state. Most of the state {{lies in a}}n area known as Tornado Alley characterized by frequent interaction between cold, dry air from Canada, warm to hot, dry air from Mexico and the Southwestern U.S., and warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. The interactions between these three contrasting air currents produces severe weather (severe thunderstorms, damaging thunderstorm winds, large hail and tornadoes) with a frequency virtually unseen anywhere else on planet Earth. An average 62 tornadoes strike the state per year—one of the highest rates in the world.|$|E
5|$|P.simplex inhabits open, usually <b>humid</b> {{tropical}} and subtropical lowlands. In Argentina, it {{is mainly}} {{a species of}} the eastern Chaco and in Brazil it {{is found in the}} Cerrado and Caatinga. Most specimens for which habitat data are known were caught on the ground in <b>humid</b> grassland, some in seasonally flooded areas; an Argentinean specimen was captured in dense swamp vegetation. It is terrestrial and semiaquatic, living on the ground but also spending time in the water.|$|E
5|$|Queensland sundews: A {{small group}} of three species (D.adelae, D.schizandra and D.prolifera), all are native to highly <b>humid</b> {{habitats}} in the dim understories of the Australian rainforest.|$|E
5|$|Saint Paul has a {{continental}} climate {{typical of the}} Upper Midwestern United States. Winters are frigid and snowy, while summers are warm to hot and <b>humid.</b> On the Köppen climate classification, Saint Paul falls in the hot summer <b>humid</b> continental climate zone (Dfa). The city experiences {{a full range of}} precipitation and related weather events, including snow, sleet, ice, rain, thunderstorms, tornadoes, and fog.|$|E
5|$|St. John's has a <b>humid</b> {{continental}} climate (Köppen Dfb), with lower seasonal variation than normal for the latitude, which {{is due to}} Gulf Stream moderation.|$|E
5|$|The Chaco {{region in}} the center-north has a {{subtropical}} climate with hot, <b>humid</b> summers and mild, dry winters. Under the Köppen climate classification, the west has a semi-arid climate (Bs) while the east has a <b>humid</b> subtropical climate (Cfa). Chaco {{is one of the}} few natural regions in the world located between tropical and temperate latitudes that is not a desert. Precipitation and temperature are relatively homogeneous throughout the region.|$|E
5|$|The Köppen {{classification}} {{depends on}} average monthly values of temperature and precipitation. The {{most commonly used}} form of the Köppen classification has five primary types labeled A through E. Specifically, the primary types are A, tropical; B, dry; C, mild mid-latitude; D, cold mid-latitude; and E, polar. The five primary classifications can be further divided into secondary classifications such as rain forest, monsoon, tropical savanna, <b>humid</b> subtropical, <b>humid</b> continental, oceanic climate, Mediterranean climate, steppe, subarctic climate, tundra, polar ice cap, and desert.|$|E

5|$|The Pseudonarcissus {{group in}} their natural habitat prefer <b>humid</b> {{situations}} such as stream margins, springs, wet pastures, clearings of forests or shrublands with <b>humid</b> soils, and moist hillsides. These habitats tend to be discontinuous in the Mediterranean mountains, producing discrete isolated populations. In Germany, which has relatively little limestone, Narcissus pseudonarcissus grows in small groups on open mountain meadows or in mixed forests of fir, beech, oak, alder, ash and birch trees with well-drained soil.|$|E
5|$|The Swiss {{climate is}} {{generally}} temperate, but can vary greatly between the localities, from glacial {{conditions on the}} mountaintops to the often pleasant near Mediterranean climate at Switzerland's southern tip. There are some valley areas {{in the southern part}} of Switzerland where some cold-hardy palm trees are found. Summers tend to be warm and <b>humid</b> at times with periodic rainfall so they are ideal for pastures and grazing. The less <b>humid</b> winters in the mountains may see long intervals of stable conditions for weeks, while the lower lands tend to suffer from inversion, during these periods, thus seeing no sun for weeks.|$|E
5|$|The climate at Yellowstone Lake is {{classified}} as subarctic (Dfc), according to Köppen-Geiger climate classification, while at the park headquarters the classification is <b>humid</b> continental (Dfb).|$|E
5|$|Under the Köppen climate classification, Boston has a <b>humid</b> {{continental}} climate (Köppen Dfa or Dfb) that borders a <b>humid</b> subtropical climate or a temperate oceanic climate (Köppen Cfa or Cfb) with some maritime influence. Despite its climate, the city {{lies at the}} transition between USDA plant hardiness zones 6b (most of the city) and 7a (Downtown, South Boston, and East Boston neighborhoods). Summers are typically warm to hot, rainy, and <b>humid,</b> while winters oscillate between periods of cold rain and snow, with cold temperatures. Spring and fall are usually mild, with varying conditions dependent on wind direction and jet stream positioning. Prevailing wind patterns that blow offshore minimize {{the influence of the}} Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from active}} flight, thrips, even {{wingless}} ones, {{can also be}} picked up by winds and transferred long distances. During warm and <b>humid</b> weather, adults may climb to the tips of plants to leap and catch air current. Wind-aided dispersal of species has been recorded over 1600km of sea between Australia and South Island of New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Being {{the highest}} {{tropical}} cordillera in the world, the Cordillera Blanca boasts {{a variety of}} ecosystems, from <b>humid</b> tropical through subalpine to alpine and tundra. The valleys and mountain slopes are covered with scattered high Andean forests and puna grassland.|$|E
5|$|Constructing {{composite}} bows requires {{much more}} time and {{a greater variety of}} materials than self bows, and the animal glue used can lose strength in <b>humid</b> conditions; the 6th-century Byzantine military manual, the Strategikon, advised the cavalry of the Byzantine army, many of whom were armed with composite bows, to keep their bows in leather cases to keep them dry. Karpowicz suggests that crafting a composite bow may take a week's work, excluding drying time (months) and gathering materials, while a self bow can be made in a day and dried in a week. Peoples living in <b>humid</b> or rainy regions historically have favoured self-bows, while those living in dry or arid regions have favoured composite bows.|$|E
5|$|It is the {{combination}} of warm <b>humid</b> air from the Gulf and dry air from the deserts of the Southwest that produce deadly storms. These conditions create an unstable severe storm creating arena. Although tornadoes occur on every continent except Antarctica they are especially common in North America, specifically the United States.|$|E
5|$|Lakes also formed (or expanded) in the Atacama at that time; highstands in Lejía Lake began rising after 11,480 ± 70 BP, and in Salar Aguas Calientes high-water levels {{lasted until}} 8,430 ± 75 BP. Highstands in Laguna Khota {{occurred}} around 12,500 and 11,000 BP. Some Salar de Atacama highstands {{are associated with}} Lake Tauca and the Coipasa highstand. Traces of the Tauca <b>humid</b> episode have been found at Salar Pedernales, past 26° south latitude. Lake Tauca's highstand correlates with river terraces in Peru's Pisco River; terraces dated 24,000–16,000 BP in its tributary, the Quebrada Veladera; enlarged drainage systems in the Quebrada Veladera; a <b>humid</b> period at Lake Junin, and new soil formation in the pampas south of the Quinto River in Argentina.|$|E
5|$|Mesopotamia has a {{subtropical}} climate with no dry season. Under the Köppen climate classification, {{it has a}} <b>humid</b> {{subtropical climate}} (Cfa). The main features of the climate are high temperatures and abundant rainfall throughout the year; this abundant rainfall makes water scarcity and extended periods of drought uncommon; most of the region has a positive water balance.|$|E
5|$|Mobile's {{geographical}} {{location on the}} Gulf of Mexico provides a mild subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa), with hot, <b>humid</b> summers and mild, rainy winters. The record low temperature was , set on February 13, 1899, and the record high was , set on August 29, 2000.|$|E
5|$|Monsoon or rainy season, lasting from July to September. The {{season is}} {{dominated}} by the <b>humid</b> southwest summer monsoon, which slowly sweeps across the country beginning in late May or early June. Monsoon rains begin to recede from North India at the beginning of October. South India typically receives more rainfall.|$|E
5|$|Other jet streams also exist. During the Northern Hemisphere summer, easterly jets {{can form}} in {{tropical}} regions, typically where dry air encounters more <b>humid</b> air at high altitudes. Low-level jets also {{are typical of}} various regions such as the central United States.|$|E
5|$|Poison dart frogs are {{endemic to}} <b>humid,</b> {{tropical}} environments of Central and South America. These frogs are generally found in tropical rainforests, including in Bolivia, Costa Rica, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela, Suriname, French Guiana, Peru, Panama, Guyana, Nicaragua, and Hawaii (introduced).|$|E
5|$|Remains of Nesomys narindaensis {{have been}} found at the sites of Antsingiavo, Ambongonambakoa, and Ambatomainty in northwestern Madagascar, which are late Pleistocene (126,000 to 10,000 years ago) and Holocene (less than 10,000 years ago) in age. Nesomys is a rare element of the rodent fauna, which is {{dominated}} by multiple species of Eliurus and Macrotarsomys. Modern Nesomys live {{on the ground in}} eastern (N.audeberti and N.rufus) and western (N.lambertoni) Madagascar. The only surviving western species, N.lambertoni, is restricted to a relict <b>humid</b> karst area; the presence of N.narindaensis and Brachyuromys mahajambaensis suggests that the past environment in northwestern Madagascar was also more <b>humid.</b> Subfossil remains of Nesomys have been recorded from some other localities in northwestern Madagascar, but these have not been described.|$|E
5|$|Scarborough's {{climate is}} {{moderate}} for Canada {{due to its}} southerly location within the country and its proximity to Lake Ontario. It has a <b>humid</b> continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfa/Dfb), with warm, <b>humid</b> summers and generally cold winters. Mean temperature and precipitation tends to be slightly lower than the downtown core or south Etobicoke for instance, {{due in part to}} the weather station being farther from the moderating influence of the lake and also because of its more northeast location. Conditions vary based on proximity to the lake, with fog more common in the south and areas close to the lake noticeably cooler on hot summer days.|$|E
5|$|Southern Manitoba (including {{the city}} of Winnipeg), falls into the <b>humid</b> {{continental}} climate zone (Köppen Dfb). This area is cold and windy {{in the winter and}} has frequent blizzards because of the open landscape. Summers are warm with a moderate length. This region is the most <b>humid</b> area in the prairie provinces, with moderate precipitation. Southwestern Manitoba, though under the same climate classification as the rest of Southern Manitoba, is closer to the semi-arid interior of Palliser's Triangle. The area is drier and more prone to droughts than other parts of southern Manitoba. This area is cold and windy in the winter and has frequent blizzards due to the openness of the prairie landscape. Summers are generally warm to hot, with low to moderate humidity.|$|E
5|$|The 16th-century Spanish conquistadors {{were armed}} with one- and two-handed broadswords, lances, pikes, rapiers, halberds, crossbows, matchlocks and light artillery. Crossbows were easier to {{maintain}} than matchlocks, {{especially in the}} <b>humid</b> tropical climate of the Caribbean region that included much of the Yucatán Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|The Pampas {{includes}} all of Buenos Aires Province, {{eastern and southern}} Córdoba Province, eastern La Pampa Province, and southern Santa Fe Province. It is subdivided into two parts: the <b>humid</b> Pampas to the east, and the dry/semi–arid Pampas to the west.|$|E
5|$|The United States, {{with its}} large size and {{geographic}} variety, includes most climate types. To {{the east of}} the 100th meridian, the climate ranges from <b>humid</b> continental in the north to <b>humid</b> subtropical in the south. The Great Plains west of the 100th meridian are semi-arid. Much of the Western mountains have an alpine climate. The climate is arid in the Great Basin, desert in the Southwest, Mediterranean in coastal California, and oceanic in coastal Oregon and Washington and southern Alaska. Most of Alaska is subarctic or polar. Hawaii and the southern tip of Florida are tropical, as are the populated territories in the Caribbean and the Pacific. Extreme weather is not uncommon—the states bordering the Gulf of Mexico are prone to hurricanes, and most of the world's tornadoes occur within the country, mainly in Tornado Alley areas in the Midwest and South.|$|E
