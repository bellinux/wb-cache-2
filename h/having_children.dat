There is little information on {{factors that influence}} desires and intentions to <b>have</b> <b>children</b> and use of contraceptives among HIV sero discordant couples. An analytical cross sectional {{study was conducted in}} Dar es Salaam with the aim of assessing factors that are associated with fertility desires, intentions and contraceptive use among HIV sero discordant couples. A total of 267 men and women participated in this study of which 65. 2 % were females. Data were analyzed using SPSS computer software. Frequencies cross tabulations and multiple logistic regression were used to assess desires, intentions and the associated factors. One hundred and twenty six participants (47. 2 %) desired to <b>have</b> <b>children.</b> Majority of HI V positive women and men who are living in HIV sero discordance and desire to <b>have</b> <b>children</b> are young, <b>have</b> a partner who desire to <b>have</b> a <b>child,</b> <b>have</b> fewer <b>children</b> and <b>have</b> CD 4 more than 200 /mm". Majority of participants who <b>had</b> <b>children</b> of their own and with their current partner intended to <b>have</b> only one <b>child</b> compared to those who <b>had</b> no <b>children</b> of their own or <b>had</b> no <b>children</b> with their current partner.

40|$|This is a {{qualitative}} study that explores {{the experiences of}} Latin as choosing not to <b>have</b> <b>children.</b> Research supports that women choosing not to <b>have</b> <b>children</b> experience cultural expectations and negative social feedback regarding their decision. Given the research findings regarding the experiences {{of women in the}} general population who choose not to <b>have</b> <b>children,</b> the researcher was curious about the culture-specific themes that might be identified that are relevant to the experience of being a female choosing not to <b>have</b> <b>children</b> in the Latino culture. A qualitative, phenomenological approach was selected and 10 Latina participants from Central America were interviewed about their experiences with choosing not to <b>have</b> <b>children.</b> Four broad themes were identified: participants 2 ̆ 7 perspectives regarding their decision process to not <b>have</b> <b>children,</b> factors influencing their decision, social interactions experienced regarding their decision, and their sense of identity as women and Latinas choosing not to <b>have</b> <b>children.</b> The findings suggest that interpersonal approaches toward understanding gender do not take into account complex gender identities that include non-traditional traits and behaviors, such as choosing not to <b>have</b> <b>children.</b> The results also suggest that the Latina 2 ̆ 7 s decision process in choosing not to <b>have</b> <b>children</b> is a multidimensional process involving cultural, interpersonal, and intrapersonal factors that may occur concurrently and vary with time and situation. In addition, the findings suggest that despite cultural expectations, negative social interactions, and complex intrapersonal process, Latinas choosing not to <b>have</b> <b>children</b> are able to continue with their decision through the help of social support and perseverance. It is not clear that there are culture-specific themes describing the Latina 2 ̆ 7 s experience with choosing not to <b>have</b> <b>children.</b> It is suggested that these findings have implications for all women choosing non-traditional lifestyles, such as choosing not to <b>have</b> <b>children.</b> Further research implications, limitations, and suggestions for future research were discussed...|$|R

5|$|In a {{study done}} by Rosamund Weatherall, Heather Joshi and Susan Macran of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in 1994, the {{research}} presented suggests that women presented with the double burden have a lower mortality rate than women who are simply housewives.

5|$|Henry {{probably}} {{spent some}} of his earliest years in his mother's household, and accompanied Matilda to Normandy in the late 1130s. Henry's later childhood, probably {{from the age of}} seven, was spent in Anjou, where he was educated by Peter of Saintes, a noted grammarian of the day. In late 1142, Geoffrey decided to send the nine-year-old to Bristol, the centre of Angevin opposition to Stephen in the south-west of England, accompanied by Robert of Gloucester. Although <b>having</b> <b>children</b> educated in relatives' households was common among noblemen of the period, sending Henry to England also had political benefits, as Geoffrey was coming under criticism for refusing to join the war in England. For about a year, Henry lived alongside Roger of Worcester, one of Robert's sons, and was instructed by a magister, Master Matthew; Robert's household was known for its education and learning. The canons of St Augustine's in Bristol also helped in Henry's education, and he remembered them with affection in later years. Henry returned to Anjou in either 1143 or 1144, resuming his education under William of Conches, another famous academic.|$|E

5|$|Egypt {{was ruled}} by the Shi'ite Fatimid dynasty from 969, {{independent}} from the Sunni Abbasid rulers in Baghdad and with a rival Shi'ite caliphconsidered the successor to the Muslim prophet Mohammad. The caliph's chief administrator, called the vizier, was chiefly responsible for governance. From 1121 the system fell into murderous political intrigue and Egypt declined from its previous affluent state. This encouraged Baldwin III of Jerusalem to plan an invasion that was only halted by the payment by Egypt of a tribute of 160,000 gold dinars. In 1163 the deposed vizier, Shawar, visited Zengi's son and successor, Nur ad-Din, atabeg of Aleppo, in Damascus seeking political and military support. Some historians have considered Nur ad-Din's support as a visionary attempt to surround the Crusaders, but in practice he prevaricated before responding only {{when it became clear}} that the Crusaders might gain an unassailable foothold on the Nile. Nur al-Din sent his Kurdish general, Shirkuh, who stormed Egypt and restored Shawar. However, Shawar asserted his independence and allied with Baldwin's brother and successor Amalric of Jerusalem. When Amalric broke the alliance in a ferocious attack, Shawar again requested military support from Syria, and Shirkuh was sent by Nur ad-Din for a second time. Amalric retreated, but the victorious Shirkuh had Shawar executed and was appointed vizier. Barely two months later he died, to be succeeded by his nephew, Yusuf ibn Ayyub, who has become known by his honorific 'Salah al-Din', 'the goodness of faith', which in turn has become westernised as Saladin. Nur al-Din died in 1174. He was the first Muslim to unite Aleppo and Damascus in the Crusade era. Some Islamic contemporaries promoted the idea that there was a natural Islamic resurgence under Zengi, through Nur al-Din to Saladin although this was not as straightforward and simple as it appears. Saladin imprisoned all the caliph's heirs, preventing them from <b>having</b> <b>children,</b> as opposed to having them all killed, which would have been normal practice, to extinguish the bloodline. Assuming control after the death of his overlord, Nur al-Din, Saladin had the strategic choice of establishing Egypt as an autonomous power or attempting to become the preeminent Muslim in the Eastern Mediterraneanhe chose the latter.|$|E
