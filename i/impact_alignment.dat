With demand for coal and freight increasing, {{there is a need}} for additional supporting infrastructure to meet requirements for the export of thermal and coking coal and potentially other future products from regional Queensland. The Surat Basin Rail project maximises the potential of mining in the Dawson Valley and Surat Basin region, which contains large potential resources of thermal coal, liquid petroleum gas, natural gas, coal seam methane gas, crude oil and gold. The Surat Basin Rail project is a key strategic development which will have significant implications for transport infrastructure and port linkages and is critical to enhancing the export capacity of the rail network to meet requirements for the export of thermal and coking coal and freight in particular. A number of corridor studies have been conducted that considered joining the existing rail network between the Western Railway and Moura Railway Systems. As part of the current investigations, these previous alignments were reviewed to determine their feasibility and potential impacts given present day conditions.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to gain a better understanding of the factors that <b>impact</b> <b>alignment</b> between institutional strategic planning and information technology strategy in higher education. The existing alignment model was examined in the context of mid-size four-year colleges and universities. This study used a combination of Delphi technique and a survey process. The sequence followed was to examine an existing theoretical model for its applicability to higher education by a Delphi expert panel, to pilot test the results of the Delphi in a survey of mid-size four-year institutions of higher education and to analyze the results. In the first phase, the Delphi method was used in two rounds to examine the Strategic Alignment Model (SAM) for application in higher education. An assembled panel of experts examined SAM, its components and questionnaire instrument, and reached a consensus after two rounds about the model’s applicability to higher education. The second phase of the study tested the Delphi panel’s findings by asking Chief Information Officers and Chief Executive Officers from four-year U. S. institutions of higher education to complete SAM’s instrument that was modified by the Delphi. The Delphi panel findings supported the use of the Strategic Alignment Model in higher education with some revisions of its terms to reflect the higher education environment more accurately. Several factors affecting institutional-IT alignment in higher education were identified. Factors associated with domain components of the SAM model as well as factors relating to bivariate linkages between the components of the model were revealed. Barbara Lach-SmithKinley, Edward R.

40|$|The {{goal of the}} FIMCAR (Frontal Impact and Compatibility Assessment Research) {{project was}} to propose a frontal impact {{assessment}} approach addressing self- and partner protection. Research strategies and priorities were based on earlier research programs and the FIMCAR accident data analysis looking at modern cars. The identified real world safety issues – such as structural interaction (especially under-/override), high acceleration loading of the occupant especially in large overlap accidents and insufficient horizontal and vertical load spreading were used for evaluating the different test candidates. In addition to the issues mentioned above, the FIMCAR accident analysis suggested that frontal force compartment integrity matching is less of an issue as originally expected. FIMCAR developed a car-to-car test program that investigated the performance of vehicle structures. Results of the test program show {{that the presence of}} a lower load path contributes to a more robust performance of the vehicle. The rearward offset of a lower load path could be reviewed and used to quantify when a lower structure design can contribute to structural interaction in both frontal and side impact configurations. In addition to the car crash test programme, numerical models of actual cars and barriers were developed and used. As car-to-car simulations with models of different car manufacturers are almost impossible because of confidentiality, Parametric Car Models (PCM) and Generic Car Models (GCM) were developed. Due to the parametric design of the PCMs it is possible to modify the models in an easy and fast way. The GCMs model virtual cars which represent an average real car of the respective category in a comparable way to the OEM models. Within the FIMCAR project, different frontal impact test candidates were analysed regarding their potential for future frontal impact legislation. The research activities focused on car-to-car frontal impact. Test procedures were developed with both a crash test programme and numerical simulations. This analysis resulted in the combination of the Full Width Deformable Barrier test (FWDB) with compatibility metrics and the existing Offset Deformable Barrier (ODB) as described in UN-ECE Regulation 94 with additional cabin integrity requirement as being proposed as the FIMCAR assessment approach. The advantages of the FWDB compared to the rigid wall are the more representative pulse and deformation pattern as well as the better assessment of load paths. The introduction of a (M) PDB without compatibility metrics (that FIMCAR was unable to deliver in time) was considered as not being appropriate. The proposed frontal impact assessment approach addresses many of the issues identified by the FIMCAR consortium (<b>impact</b> <b>alignment,</b> high acceleration pulse loading, maintenance of compartment strength requirements, etc.) but not all frontal impact and compatibility issues could be addressed (load spreading). A benefit analysis estimated the benefit of the following three options: no change, introduction of full width test with compatibility assessment in addition to current ECE R 94 and introduction of full width test with compatibility assessment and replacement of current ODB test by PDB test with load spreading metric. The comparison of calculated break even costs for option 2 with estimated costs for achieving the benefit from previous projects suggests a positive cost benefit ratio.

It is shown that nuclear magnetism modifies the expectation values of single-particle spin, orbital and total angular momenta along the rotational axis effectively creating additional angular momentum. This effect leads to the increase of kinematic and dynamic moments of inertia at given rotational frequency and has an <b>impact</b> on effective <b>alignments.</b> Comment: 16 pages, 4 figures, submitted to Physical Review...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{explore the}} impacts of IT {{infrastructure}} flexibility components (connectivity, modularity, compatibility, and IT personnel flexibility) on IT-business strategic alignment using Luftman’s strategic alignment maturity model. Design/methodology/approach: A questionnaire was developed using 5 -points Likert scale. The questionnaire was distributed to companies in Indonesia, where 48 companies filled the questionnaire completely. The {{data were analyzed using}} partial least squares (PLS) approach using WarpPLS version 3. 0. Findings: This research found that amongst four components of IT infrastructure flexibility, only compatibility that gives a positive and significant impact to IT-business strategic alignment. This finding is remarkably in contrast to what had been found by Chung et al (2003) in which connectivity, modularity and IT personnel flexibility showed a positive <b>impact</b> on strategic <b>alignment</b> while compatibility did not.   Research limitations: This research used small sample size. More respondents are required to obtain more general conclusions.   Practical implications: The findings of this study can be input for IT investment initiatives by first focusing on compatibility aspect of IT infrastructure which is considered having the most significant influence on strategic alignment. Originality/value: Previous study investigated IT infrastructure flexibility as a single concept, whereas our research investigated the components of IT infrastructure flexibility and their <b>impact</b> on strategic <b>alignment...</b>|$|R
