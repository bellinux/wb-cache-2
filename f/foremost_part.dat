Behind the boys I could now distinctly behold {{a man and woman}} of the Polynesian type, naked to the waist, and staggering with bent backs beneath showers of blows. The people behind them, who were almost as light in colour as ourselves, were cruelly flogging them with cutting branches of trees. Round the necks of the unfortunate victims--criminals I presumed--were hung chains of white and black figs, and in their hands they held certain herbs, figs, and cheese, for what purpose I was, and remain, unable to conjecture. Whenever their cries were still for a moment, the woman who carried the idol turned round, and lifted it in her arms with words which I was unable to understand, urging on the tormentors to ply their switches with more severity.|$|E

60|$|Isidore-Auguste-Marie-François-Xavier Comte {{was born}} in January 1798, at Montpellier, where {{his father was a}} receiver-general of taxes for the district. He was sent for his {{earliest}} instruction to the school of the town, and in 1814 was admitted to the École Polytechnique. His youth was marked by a constant willingness to rebel against merely official authority; to genuine excellence, whether moral or intellectual, he was always ready to pay unbounded deference. That strenuous application which was one of his most remarkable gifts in manhood showed itself in his youth, and his application was backed or inspired by superior intelligence and aptness. After he had been two years at the École Polytechnique he took a <b>foremost</b> <b>part</b> in a mutinous demonstration against one of the masters; the school was broken up, and Comte like the other scholars was sent home. To the great dissatisfaction of his parents, he resolved to return to Paris (1816), and to earn his living there by giving lessons in mathematics. Benjamin Franklin was the youth's idol at this moment. 'I seek to imitate the modern Socrates,' he wrote to a school friend, 'not in talents, but in way of living. You know that at five and twenty he formed the design of becoming perfectly wise, and that he fulfilled his design. I have dared to undertake the same thing, though I am not yet twenty.' Though Comte's character and aims were as far removed as possible from Franklin's type, neither Franklin nor any man that ever lived could surpass him in the heroic tenacity with which, {{in the face of a}} thousand obstacles, he pursued his own ideal of a vocation.|$|E

For eighteenth- and nineteenth century Korean intellectuals, Tibet was first and <b>foremost</b> a <b>part</b> (albeit rather heterogeneous) of the China-centred political space and known mostly from Chinese sources.

40|$|This article aims {{to offer}} an {{in-depth}} explanation {{of the role of}} WTO law in the Estonian legal system and the way it has changed over the years. A comparative analysis of the legal status and effect of WTO law prior to and after Estonia’s accession to the European Union in 2004 has been conducted. Given the significant influence of EU law on the Estonian legal order, key developments regarding WTO law at EU level are highly relevant and have been discussed in considerable detail. The article concludes that the role of WTO law in the Estonian legal system has changed considerably since 2004. Today, WTO law should be viewed in Estonia first and <b>foremost</b> as <b>part</b> of EU law. Constraints stemming from EU law have {{to be taken into account}} when resorting to WTO law in domestic courts. As a result, the extent to which WTO law can be referred to in Estonian courts has decreased. Although WTO law is generally not directly applicable in domestic courts, there are nevertheless certain ways in which it can be relied on. The Estonian Supreme Court has in several cases made reference to WTO law with the aim of interpreting ambiguous national provisions. This practice is to be welcomed. In conclusion, the article suggests that in order for Estonia to be able to successfully navigate in the globalizing marketplace, it is desirable to ensure that the overall awareness of WTO law continues to increase...|$|R
