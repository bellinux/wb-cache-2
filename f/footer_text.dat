5000|$|In {{addition}} to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, {{many of the}} U.S. district courts have developed their own requirements included in Local Rules for filing with the Court. Local Rules can set up a limit {{on the number of}} pages, establish deadlines for motions and responses, explain whether it is acceptable to combine a motion petition with a response, specify if a judge needs an additional copy of the documents (called [...] "judgeâ€™s copy"), etc. Local Rules can define page layout elements like: margins, text font/size, distance between lines, mandatory <b>footer</b> <b>text,</b> page numbering, and provide directions on how the pages need to be bound together - i.e. acceptable fasteners, number and location of fastening holes, etc. If the filed motion does not comply with the Local Rules then the judge can choose to strike the motion completely, or order the party to re-file its motion, or grant a special exception to the Local Rules.|$|E
5000|$|Many U.S. {{district}} {{courts have}} {{developed their own}} requirements included in local rules for filing summary-judgment motions. Local rules can set limits {{on the number of}} pages, explain if a separate factual statement is required, whether it is acceptable to combine motion petition with a response, and if a judge needs an additional copy of the documents (called a [...] "judge's copy"), etc. Local Rules can define page-layout elements like: margins, text font/size, distance between lines, mandatory <b>footer</b> <b>text,</b> page numbering, and provide directions on how the pages need to be bound together - i.e., acceptable fasteners, number and location of fastening holes, etc. If the filed motion does not comply with the local rules, then the judge can choose to strike the motion completely, or order the party to re-file its motion, or grant a special exception to the local rules. Summary-judgment motions, like many other court filings, are a matter of public record. So under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 5.2, sensitive text like Social Security number, Taxpayer Identification Number, birthday, bank accounts and children's names, should be redacted from the summary-judgment motion and accompanying exhibits. The redacted text can be erased with black-out or white-out, and the page should have an indication that it was redacted - most often by stamping the word [...] "redacted" [...] on the bottom. Alternately, the filing party may ask the court's permission to file some exhibits completely under seal. A minor's name of the petitions should be replaced with initials. A person making a redacted filing can file an unredacted copy under seal, or the court can choose to order later that an additional filing be made under seal without redaction. Copies of both redacted and unredacted documents filed with court should be provided to the other parties in the case.|$|E
40|$|Hundreds of {{experiments}} {{over the last}} decade on the retrieval of OCR documents performed by the Information Science Research Institute have shown that OCR errors do not significantly affect retrievability. We extend those results to show {{that in the case of}} proximity searching, the removal of running headers and <b>footers</b> from OCR <b>text</b> will not improve retrievability for such searches...|$|R
40|$|The MTS Manual is {{a series}} of volumes that {{describe}} in detail the facilities provided by the Michigan Terminal System. Volume 15 contains the descriptions for the FORMAT and TEXT 360 text-processing programs. FORMAT is a text-processing language that takes the text of a document in free format, and reformats it into lines, paragraphs, and pages according to control information supplied with the text. FORMAT numbers pages, generates titles and <b>footers,</b> justifies <b>text</b> (aligns right and left margins), indents sections of text, prints text in multiple columns, etc. An index and table of contents may be generated for the document. TEXT 360 is a text-processing system that can expedite the production of publishable documents. The TEXT 360 user specifies the desired format by embedding two types of instructions in the text flow: "edit codes," which usually affect the format of a relatively small area of text, and "alter codes," which are more general instructions dealing with format specifications of a larger scope, such as page depth, column width, etc...|$|R
