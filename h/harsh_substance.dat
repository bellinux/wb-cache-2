25|$|The {{modern day}} {{interest}} in absinthe {{has spawned a}} rash of absinthe kits from companies that claim they produce homemade absinthe. Kits often call for soaking herbs in vodka or alcohol, or adding a liquid concentrate to vodka or alcohol to create an ersatz absinthe. Such practices usually yield a <b>harsh</b> <b>substance</b> that bears {{little resemblance to the}} genuine article, and are considered inauthentic by any practical standard. Some concoctions may even be dangerous, especially if they call for supplementation with potentially poisonous herbs, oils and/or extracts. In at least one documented case, a person suffered acute kidney injury after drinking 10ml of pure wormwood oilâ€”a dose much higher than that found in absinthe.|$|E

The program is specifically designed to educate the student in the life altering ramifications of drinking and driving. The program is mainly backed by the police department and has later encompassed EMS and fire into the program for vehicle extrication demonstrations.|$|R
2500|$|The Journal of Archaeological Science {{published}} a detailed {{study by the}} British Museum and the Smithsonian in May 2008. Using electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, a team of British and American researchers found that the British Museum skull was worked with a <b>harsh</b> abrasive <b>substance</b> such as corundum or diamond, and shaped using a rotary disc tool made from some suitable metal. The Smithsonian specimen had been worked with a different abrasive, namely the silicon-carbon compound carborundum (Silicon carbide) which is a synthetic substance manufactured using modern industrial techniques. Since the synthesis of carborundum dates only to the 1890s and its wider availability to the 20th century, the researchers concluded [...] "he suggestion {{is that it was}} made in the 1950s or later".|$|R
