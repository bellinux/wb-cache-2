5|$|Bees play an {{important}} role in pollinating flowering plants, and are the major type of pollinator in many ecosystems that contain flowering plants. It is estimated that one third of the human food supply depends on pollination by insects, birds and bats, most of which <b>is</b> <b>accomplished</b> <b>by</b> bees, whether wild or domesticated.|$|E
5|$|Gas {{exchange}} and excretion <b>is</b> <b>accomplished</b> <b>by</b> diffusion through the tentacles and {{internal and external}} body wall, aided by the movement of fluid being wafted along these surfaces by cilia. The sensory system consists of simple nerve nets in the gastrodermis and epidermis, {{but there are no}} specialised sense organs.|$|E

5|$|The {{flight of}} the Alpine chough is swift and acrobatic with loose deep wing beats. Its high {{manoeuvrability}} <b>is</b> <b>accomplished</b> <b>by</b> fanning the tail, folding its wings, and soaring in the updraughts at cliff faces. Even in flight, it can be distinguished from the red-billed chough by its less rectangular wings, and longer, less square-ended tail.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{published}} by Ocean Software, who were renowned for developing video games related to their respective films and television shows. The main objective {{of the game is}} to apprehend criminals throughout the streets of Miami, which <b>is</b> <b>accomplished</b> <b>by</b> driving to various locations around the city. Miami Vice received mixed reviews upon release; the game was mainly criticised due to its poor mechanics and graphics, though some reviewers praised the overall experience.|$|E
5|$|The {{genetic code}} is {{the set of}} rules by which {{information}} encoded within genetic material (DNA or mRNA sequences) is translated into proteins by living cells. Translation <b>is</b> <b>accomplished</b> <b>by</b> the ribosome, which links amino acids in an order specified by mRNA, using transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules to carry amino acids and to read the mRNA three nucleotides at a time. The genetic code is highly similar among all organisms and can be expressed in a simple table with 64 entries.|$|E
5|$|Porpoises {{and other}} smaller cetaceans, mainly dolphins, are hunted in an {{activity}} known as drive hunting. This <b>is</b> <b>accomplished</b> <b>by</b> driving a pod together with boats and usually into a bay or onto a beach. Their escape is prevented by closing off the route to the ocean with other boats or nets. Porpoises are hunted this way in several places around the world, including the Solomon Islands, the Faroe Islands, Peru, and Japan, the most well-known practitioner of this method. By numbers, porpoises are mostly hunted for their meat, though some end up in dolphinariums. Despite the controversial nature of the hunt resulting in international criticism, and the possible health risk that the high methylmercury levels impose, thousands of porpoises are caught in drive hunts each year.|$|E

5|$|Space itself {{possesses}} symmetry. It {{looks the}} same no matter how one rotates it, and the resulting rotational symmetry {{is referred to as}} isotropy of space. In the present case it is common to use passive rotations, meaning that the observer rotates themself. Mathematically, the active operation of a rotation is performed by multiplying position vectors by a rotation matrix. A passive rotation <b>is</b> <b>accomplished</b> <b>by</b> rotating only the basis vectors of the coordinate system. (The coordinate system {{can be thought of as}} being fixed in the rotated observer. The observer is physically rotated.) In this way, every point in space obtains new coordinates as if it was somehow physically rigidly rotated.|$|E
5|$|The lungs in {{amphibians}} are primitive {{compared to}} those of amniotes, possessing few internal septa and large alveoli, and consequently having a comparatively slow diffusion rate for oxygen entering the blood. Ventilation <b>is</b> <b>accomplished</b> <b>by</b> buccal pumping. Most amphibians, however, are able to exchange gases with the water or air via their skin. To enable sufficient cutaneous respiration, the surface of their highly vascularised skin must remain moist to allow the oxygen to diffuse at a sufficiently high rate. Because oxygen concentration in the water increases at both low temperatures and high flow rates, aquatic amphibians in these situations can rely primarily on cutaneous respiration, as in the Titicaca water frog and the hellbender salamander. In air, where oxygen is more concentrated, some small species can rely solely on cutaneous gas exchange, most famously the plethodontid salamanders, which have neither lungs nor gills. Many aquatic salamanders and all tadpoles have gills in their larval stage, with some (such as the axolotl) retaining gills as aquatic adults.|$|E
5|$|The player gains {{points by}} {{defeating}} multiple enemies consecutively and {{can participate in}} a bonus round to gain more points. Enemies are defeated by kicking them over once they have been flipped on their back. This <b>is</b> <b>accomplished</b> <b>by</b> hitting the platform the enemy is on directly beneath them. If the player allows too much time to pass after doing this, the enemy will flip itself back over, changing in color and increasing speed. Each phase has {{a certain number of}} enemies, with the final enemy immediately changing color and increasing to maximum speed. Hitting a flipped enemy from underneath causes it to right itself and start moving again, but it does not change speed or color.|$|E

5|$|The studio defined only Blythe and {{the pets}} as characters, so the Cahills sought {{to expand the}} human character's fictional universe, {{designing}} Blythe's friends, Mrs. Twombly, and the Biskit twins. Julie explained {{that she and her}} husband's preference for quirky comedy inspired that of the show. While the show is aimed at a demographic of young girls, Julie said that she and the writers attempt to cater to boys of the same age and parent viewers simultaneously. Original music for the show <b>is</b> <b>accomplished</b> <b>by</b> film and television composers Daniel Ingram and Steffan Andrews. Ingram wrote that the urban setting of Littlest Pet Shop prompted the use of a modern style of music. The score incorporates pop and other cultural influences for the same reason. Ingram found Hasbro's pushing of the limitations for music in daytime television a source of pride.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Mario is {{a falling}} block tile-matching video {{game in which}} Mario assumes {{the role of a}} doctor, tossing two-colored medical {{capsules}} into a medicine bottle representing the playing field. This area is populated by viruses of three colors: red, yellow, and blue, which stay in their starting position until removed. In a manner and style considered similar to Tetris, the player manipulates each capsule as it vertically falls 1 unit of space at a time, able to move it left or right and rotate it 90 degrees in either clockwise or counter-clockwise. When four or more capsule halves or viruses of matching color are aligned in vertical or horizontal configurations, they are removed from play. Any remaining capsule halves or whole capsules which are now not supported by a virus or capsule will fall {{to the bottom of the}} playing field or until it hits another supported object, and any new 4-in-a-row alignments created from this will also be removed. The main objective is to complete levels, which <b>is</b> <b>accomplished</b> <b>by</b> eliminating all viruses from the playing field. A game over occurs if capsules fill up the playing field in a way that obstructs the bottle's narrow neck. After each 5th level is completed on Medium or High difficulty, up to level 20, a cut-scene is shown where the virus trio is sitting on a tree as music plays and an object flies across the screen.|$|E
5|$|Glass welding is {{a common}} {{practice}} during glassblowing. It is used very often {{in the construction of}} lighting, neon signs, flashtubes, scientific equipment, and the manufacture of dishes and other glassware. It is also used during glass casting for joining the halves of glass molds, making items such as bottles and jars. Welding glass <b>is</b> <b>accomplished</b> <b>by</b> heating the glass through the glass transition, turning it into a thick, formable, liquid mass. Heating is usually done with a gas or oxy-gas torch, or a furnace, because the temperatures for melting glass are often quite high. This temperature may vary, {{depending on the type of}} glass. For example, lead glass becomes a weldable liquid at around , and can be welded with a simple propane torch. On the other hand, quartz glass (fused silica) must be heated to over , but quickly loses its viscosity and formability if overheated, so an oxyhydrogen torch must be used. Sometimes a tube may be attached to the glass, allowing it to be blown into various shapes, such as bulbs, bottles, or tubes. When two pieces of liquid glass are pressed together, they will usually weld very readily. Welding a handle onto a pitcher can usually be done with relative ease. However, when welding a tube to another tube, a combination of blowing and suction, and pressing and pulling is used to ensure a good seal, to shape the glass, and to keep the surface tension from closing the tube in on itself. Sometimes a filler rod may be used, but usually not.|$|E
