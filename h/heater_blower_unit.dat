40|$|Drying {{is an old}} and {{well-established}} {{method of}} food preservation. Traditionally, crops (and fish) are spread {{out in the sun}} to dry, but this leaves them vulnerable to the vagaries of the weather to attack by pests and theft by birds and animals. To provide a solution to this problem the Intermediate Technology Group worked on developing an effective drying cabinet that was cheap to build and to run. An initial programme to dry sorrel in St. Vincent in 1974 led to further experimentation in Guatemala, where the need was to dry vegetables. The technology was then further refined and transferred to Peru and other countries in Latin America, where the need was as diverse as herbal teas and fruit. The first system consisted of a simple plywood double-cabinet drier, holding nine trays with air heated by a Benson-letaire <b>heater</b> <b>blower.</b> It was soon realized that the lower trays dried first and could be removed, the upper trays moved down and new trays added to the top. Moving the trays became time-consuming and so a semi-continuous system that allowed the trays to move down the cabinet was developed. The system was adapted in interesting ways to meet local needs and conditions and where fuel was cheap the semicontinuous, fuelefficient design was not always favoured. The drier is now being used in Bangladesh where It is helping a group of landless women process their coconut all year round. It has even been used in Ireland to process organically grown herbs.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{analysis of}} the life-cycle costs for individual households and the aggregate energy and economic impacts from potential energy efficiency improvements in U. S. residential furnaces. Most homes in the US are heated by a central furnace attached to ducts for distributing heated air and fueled by natural gas. Electricity consumption by a furnace blower is significant, comparable to the annual electricity consumption of a major appliance. Since the same <b>blower</b> <b>unit</b> is also used during the summer to circulate cooled air in centrally air conditioned homes, electricity savings occur year round. Estimates are provided of the potential electricity savings from more efficient fans and motors. Current regulations require new residential gas-fired furnaces (not including mobile home furnaces) to meet or exceed 78 percent annual fuel utilization efficiency (AFUE), but in fact nearly all furnaces sold are at 80 percent AFUE or higher. The possibilities for higher fuel efficiency fall into two groups: more efficient non-condensing furnaces (81 percent AFUE) and condensing furnaces (90 - 96 percent AFUE). There are also options {{to increase the efficiency}} of the furnace blower. This paper reports the projected national energy and economic impacts of requiring higher efficiency furnaces in the future. Energy savings vary with climate, with the result that condensing furnaces offer larger energy savings in colder climates. The range of impacts for a statistical sample of households and the percent of households with net savings in life cycle cost are shown. Gas furnaces are somewhat unusual in that the technology does not easily permit incremental change to the AFUE above 80 percent. Achieving significant energy savings requires use of condensing technology, which yields a large efficiency gain (to 90 percent or higher AFUE), but has a higher cost. With respect to electricity efficiency design options, the ECM has a negative effect on the average LCC. The current extra cost of this technology more than offsets the sizable electricity savings...|$|R

However, the initial generation of Mild Hybrid Electric Vehicles is expected to have both 48 V and 12 V systems. The {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate the potential benets of shifting electrical loads to the 48 V supply in the future Mild Hybrid Electric Vehicles at Volvo Car Corporation (VC). A literature study has been carried out to identify the loads on the existing 12 V automotive electrical network that could be considered to be suitable for a 48 V operation. The whole system has been modelled in MatLab R Simulink R and simulations were carried out to evaluate their performance at three temperatures (20 C, + 20 C and + 40 C). The savings in fuel consumption due to moving of loads to the 48 V bus have been analysed. Also, new loads that could improve the user experience have been identied. The complete system has been evaluated for its electrical performance and fuel consumption. The weight reduction by shifting loads to the 48 V bus have also been looked into. The results suggest that the 48 V mild hybrid system eciency is high during high loading condition primarily due to the increased eciency of Belt Driven Starter Generator (BSG). The fuel savings at 20 C, + 20 C and + 40 C have been estimated to be 376 ml/ 100 km, 32 ml/ 100 km and 103 ml/ 100 km respectively for the WLTP cycle. The considerable benet on reduced fuel consumption is also due to the higher amount of energy that is recuperated at 48 V.

This monograph aims to research concepts, elements and materials needed for the thermal comfort of an environment, such that, the research leads us to shape a proposal which might be into the climatic parameters of the city of Cuenca. Therefore, it is investigated and analyzed the weather of the area which helps us {{to see what kind of}} material, with the highest thermal energy, and which do not affect the environment would be right for this type of housing. This pretends to achieve the appropriate thermal comfort. This project could be useful as a guide for architects, designers and customers whose goal will be to build this kind of houses. For those who are not just searching the adequate thermal comfort for the environment, but that will greatly benefit the entire environment by saving on energy consumption and also avoid the use of <b>heaters</b> and <b>blowers.</b> Cuenc...|$|R
40|$|The ASB {{reviews the}} {{auxiliary}} and radwaste area ventilation system (ARAVS) from air intake {{to the point}} of discharge where the system connects to the gaseous cleanup and treatment system or station vents to assure conformance with the requirements of General Design Criteria 2, 5, and 60. The review includes components such as | air intakes, ducts, air conditioning <b>units,</b> <b>blowers,</b> isolation dampers, and roof exhaust fans. The review of the ARAVS covers the radwaste areas and controlled access nonradioactive areas and their relationship to safety-related areas in the auxiliary building. 1. The ASB reviews the functional performance requirements and the air treatment equipment for the ARAVS to determine whether the ventilation system or portions of the system have been designed or need to be designed as a safety-related system. Based on this determination, the safety-related part of the system is reviewed with respect to functional performance requirements during normal operation, during adverse environmental occurrences, and during and subsequent to postulated accidents, including the loss of offsite power. The ASB reviews safety-related portions of the system to assure that: a. A single active failure cannot result in loss of the system functional performance capability. b. Failures of nonseismic Category I. equipment or components will not result in unfiltered releases of radioactive contaminants. 2. The ASB also reviews safety-related portions of the ARAVS with respect to the following...|$|R
40|$|Conversion {{of cocoa}} beans to {{chocolate}} product is, therefore, {{one of the}} promising alternatives to increase the value added of dried cocoa beans. On the other hand, the development of chocolate industry requires an appropriate technology that is not available yet for small or medium scale of business. Breaking and deshelling cocoa roasted beans is one important steps in cocoa processing to ascertain good chocolate quality. The aim {{of this research is}} to study performance of rotary cutter type breaking machine for breaking and deshelling cocoa roasted beans. Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Institute has designed and tested a rotary cutter type breaking machine for breaking and deshelling cocoa roasted beans. Breaker unit has rotated by Â½ HP power, single phase, 110 / 220 V and 1440 rpm. Transmission system that use for rotating breaker unit is pulley and single V belt. Centrifugal <b>blower</b> as separator <b>unit</b> between cotyledon and shell has specification 0. 5 m 3 /min air flow, 780 Pa, 370 W, and 220 V. Field tests showed that the optimum capacity of the machine was 268 kg/h with 500 rpm speed of rotary cutter, 2, 8 m/s separator air flow, and power require was 833 W. Percentage product in outlet 1 and 2 were 94. 5 % and 5. 5 %. Particle distribution from outlet 1 was 92 % as cotyledon, 8 % as shell in cotyledon and on outlet 2 was 97 % as shell, 3 % as cotyledon in shell.

40|$|The ASB {{reviews the}} turbine area {{ventilation}} system (TAVS) from air intake {{to the point}} of discharge to assure conformance with the requirements of General Design Criteria 2, 5, and 60. The review includes components such as air intakes, ducts, cooling <b>units,</b> <b>blowers,</b> isolation dampers, and roof exhaust fans. The review of the TAVS includes systems contained in the turbine building and their relationship, if any, to safety-related equipment areas. 1. The ASB reviews the functional performance requirements and the methods and equipment provided for air treatment for the TAVS to determine whether the ventilation system or portions of the system have been designed or need to be designed as a safety system. In making this determination, systems provided for heating, ventilating, and air conditioning of the turbine area, designed to normal industrial standards, and those systems that provide for control and filtration of small quantities of radioactive gas leakage in the turbine area during normal plant operation, are not considered safety. related {{for the purpose of this}} SRP section. Based on this determination, any safety-related portions of the system are reviewed with respect to functional performance requirements during adverse environmental occurrences, during normal opera-tion, and subsequent to postulated accidents, including the loss of offsite power. The ASB reviews the safety-related portions of the system to assure that: a. A single active failure cannot result in loss of the system functional performance capability. b. Failures of nonseismic Category I equipment or components will not result in an unacceptable release of radioactive contaminants...|$|R
