25|$|Any fish {{processing}} usually occurs in deck houses or below deck. A wet fish stern trawler stores {{the fish in}} ice or sea water which has been refrigerated. A freezer stern trawler stores the fish in frozen boxes or blocks, and a <b>factory</b> <b>stern</b> <b>trawler</b> processes the catch. A pelagic stern trawler may use fish pumps to empty the codend.|$|E
50|$|A <b>factory</b> <b>stern</b> <b>trawler</b> {{is a large}} {{stern trawler}} which has {{additional}} onboard processing facilities and can stay at sea for days or weeks at a time. A stern trawler tows a fishing trawl net and hauls the catch up a stern ramp. These can be either demersal (weighted bottom trawling); pelagic (mid-water trawling); or pair trawling, where two vessels about 500 metres apart together pull one huge net with a mouth circumference of 900 meters.|$|E

40|$|While I was a {{scientific}} observer for the United States aboard a Japanese fishing vessel in the North Pacific Ocean, I observed two sea urchins living within the cavity {{of the air}} bladder of the bull kelp, Nereocystis luetkeana (Mertens). The sea urchins were identified as Allocentrotus fragilis (Jackson) by David Pawson of the Smithsonian Institution (personal communication). The kelp was taken in an otter trawl of the Japanese <b>factory</b> ship <b>stern</b> <b>trawler</b> "Takachiho Maru" on April 23, 1965, off Fox Islands in the Aleutians (53 ° 26 'N, 166 ° 01 'W). I witnessed {{the discovery of the}} urchins when a worker cut into the air bladder after picking the kelp from the landing bin. The kelp was intact, and the urchins were dark red and glistened with moisture. No sea water was in the bladder. I acquired the kelp with the urchins still inside and examined the bulb for openings other than the cut made by the worker. No other openings were visible, although some of the top of the kelp bulb broke after the initial cut was made (Fig. 1). The cavity of the bulb did not extend into the stipe, and the opening made by the worker had to be enlarged to remove the urchins...|$|R

40|$|The American style {{purse seiner}} of 500 GT class was studied in {{comparision}} with the <b>stern</b> <b>trawler</b> of 500 GT class originally developed in England and improved and established in Japan, {{in terms of}} principal particulars and other items expressed in mean value of four vessels each as the previous paper. The American style purse seiner is 15. 8 % broader in actual size than the <b>stern</b> <b>trawler</b> and 12 % broder in L/B. The cruising speed of the purse seiner at 3 / 4 load of full load condition is 14, 7 knots which is faster than the <b>stern</b> <b>trawler</b> by 2. 8 knots. The purse seiner has the hull form of greater midship section coefficient and smaller block coefficient, i. e., the hull form of fat midship and slim bow and stern together with a fine streamline shape of the bottom {{in front of the}} propeller and the broad stern deck. As to the motion characteristics of the purse seiner in longitudinal wave, the relative pitching of the bow against the wave surface shows a 20 ～ 30 % greater amplitude when synchronized with the severest head sea as compared with the conventional avarage Japanese fishing vessels. However, since consideration has been given to the height of the bow freeboard and to the increase of flaring, the splash of waves from the bow may not be particularly strong. 米国で開発された 500 総トン級米国式旋網船と英国で開発され日本で改良固定された 500 総トン級船尾トロール船各 4 隻の諸要目,速力,船型,性能の平均値を比較検討した。米国式旋網船は船尾トロール船より巾が 15. 8 %広い。平均速力は,巡航速力(3 / 4 負荷) における米国式旋網船が 2. 8 ノット速い 14. 7 ノットであり,抵抗試験によれば米国式旋網船は現存の肥大船型に比べて推進馬力が半分以下でも同一速力が出せる燃料節減船型である事が推定されている。船型は,船体中央部が旋網船が肥っており船首尾でやせており,プロペラ前方の船底部分がきれいな流線型となっている。旋網船の縦波中の運動特性は,船首の波面に対する相対上下揺振を在来の平均的日本漁船と比べると最もきびしい向い波同調状態時において 20 ～ 30 %程度の振巾増加が見られるが,船首乾舷の高さとフレアーの増大が考慮されているので船首からの波浪打ち込みが特に激しくなる事は無いと考えられる...|$|R
