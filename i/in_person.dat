40|$|The true {{extent and}} nature of {{trafficking}} <b>in</b> <b>persons</b> <b>in</b> Australia remains a mystery despite wild speculations about the scale of this problem. This article aims to dispel some of the confusion surrounding trafficking <b>in</b> <b>persons</b> by examining the claims made about the prevalence of this offence and displacing many of the myths {{about the number of}} victims in Australia. This involves an analysis of the Australian Government’s approach to data collection and a critical examination of the data provided by non-official sources, especially non-governmental organisations and advocacy groups. The article also investigates the ‘dark figure’ of trafficking <b>in</b> <b>persons</b> <b>in</b> Australia and concludes by developing recommendations to measure trafficking <b>in</b> <b>persons</b> <b>in</b> Australia more accurately and by offering directions for further research in this field...|$|R

As UNODC has been systematically collecting data on trafficking <b>in</b> <b>persons</b> for more than a decade, trend information is presented for a broad range of indicators. The thematic chapter of the 2016 edition of the Global Report looks at how migrants and refugees can be vulnerable to trafficking <b>in</b> <b>persons,</b> en route or at destination. It also analyses the particular condition of people escaping war, conflict and persecution. Most countries have passed legislation that criminalizes trafficking <b>in</b> <b>persons</b> as a specific offence; many have done so recently. The Global Report shows that there is a relation between how long a country has had proper trafficking legislation on its books, and how many convictions it reports. Countries with longer-standing legislation record, on average, more convictions. That said, the overall criminal justice response to trafficking <b>in</b> <b>persons,</b> which has historically been very weak, has not improved significantly...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a foundation for}} ongoing research on trafficking <b>in</b> <b>persons</b> <b>in</b> the Pacific Islands region and the identification of effective prevention strategies. There is emerging evidence that the Pacific Island region is vulnerable to the crime of trafficking <b>in</b> <b>persons.</b> Using information {{from a range of}} Pacific Island stakeholder forums and consultations conducted by the Australian Institute of Criminology (AIC), together with a review of the literature, key issues relevant to trafficking <b>in</b> <b>persons</b> <b>in</b> the Pacific Islands region are identified in this paper. Existing patterns of people movement, weak border and immigration controls, states affected by poor governance, failing rule of law and corruption, the impact of cultural practices entwined with poverty and a limited capacity to respond to natural disasters are identified as key vulnerabilities to trafficking <b>in</b> <b>persons.</b> It is noted that the factors that facilitate susceptibility to trafficking also provide focal areas for strategies to prevent and suppress trafficking <b>in</b> <b>persons</b> and to address transnational crime in the Pacific Islands region more generally. This paper {{provides a}} foundation for ongoing research on trafficking <b>in</b> <b>persons</b> <b>in</b> the Pacific Islands region and the identification of effective prevention strategies, which will be undertaken by the AIC in the future...|$|R
