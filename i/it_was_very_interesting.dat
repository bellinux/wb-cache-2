500|$|In an {{overview}} of the third season in Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Apocrypha" [...] was rated an A. The review noted that the episode offered [...] "some interesting progressions in the grand theme" [...] of the series, although it was also [...] "worth it just for the awesome missile site finale" [...] alone. Writing for The A.V. Club, Zack Handlen also rated the episode an A. Handlen felt the episode was impressive in its general impression, but that the details were not necessarily important; he also added that the cyclical nature of the plot of most mythology episodes was not something he felt negatively about, noting that although the series' protagonists are often defeated, they [...] "can't be corrupted or dissuaded or undone". Co-writer Frank Spotnitz said of the episode [...] "I actually think you didn't learn a lot more about the conspiracy in these two episodes, but emotionally, I think they were really good episodes ... It is really easy to go through a lot of these action things with people dying and never addressing them. So I thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> to do so".|$|E

We {{were one of the}} only Latin families growing up. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> to be in that environment; it was such a complete departure from our lives in Uruguay. Essentially, we were in a place where people didn't want you, and didn't understand what you were about", he said. And though Espuelas did not speak any English, [...] "growing up like that provided a tremendous incentive for me to learn. [...] " ...|$|E
2500|$|Collins {{adapted the}} novel for film herself, in {{collaboration}} with screenwriter Billy Ray and director Gary Ross. The screenplay remains extremely faithful to the original novel, with Ross saying he [...] "felt {{the only way to}} make the film really successful was to be totally subjective", echoing Collins' presentation of the novel in the first person present. Instead of Katniss' internal monologue about the Capitol's machinations, the screenplay expanded the character of Seneca Crane, the Head Gamemaker, to allow several developments to be shown directly to the audience. Ross explained, [...] "In the book, Katniss speculates about the game-makers' manipulations... in the film, we can't get inside Katniss's head, but we do have the ability to cut away and actually show the machinations of the Capitol behind the scenes. I created the game center and also expanded the role of Seneca Crane for those reasons. I thought it was tonally important." [...] Ross also added several scenes between Crane and Coriolanus Snow, the elderly President of Panem, noting that [...] "I thought that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> that there would be one generation [...] who knew that [...] were actually an instrument of political control, and there would be a successive generation who was so enamoured with the ratings and the showbiz and the sensations and the spectacle that was subsuming the actual political intention, and that's really where the tension is".|$|E

60|$|I {{remember}} something, {{but not so}} much of it as I {{should like}} to recall, of my long tramp to Bladesover House.

60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> to Gudrun {{to think}} of his making the great granite frieze for a great granite factory in Cologne.

It was a {{representation}} of a fair, with peasants and artisans in an orgy of enjoyment, drunk and absurd in their modern dress, whirling ridiculously in roundabouts, gaping at shows, kissing and staggering and rolling in knots, swinging in swing-boats, and firing down shooting galleries, a frenzy of chaotic motion.|$|E
60|$|Their domiciles {{being so}} near together, {{there were many}} {{encounters}} in going in and out, nor were these avoided on either side.

60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting,</b> {{but still}} a little cheerless, and when I lay in bed that night I thought of Nettie and the queer {{modifications}} of preference she had made, and among other things and in a way, I prayed. I prayed that night, let me confess it, to an image I had set up in my heart, an image that still serves with me as a symbol for things inconceivable, to a Master Artificer, the unseen captain of all who go about {{the building of the}} world, the making of mankind.|$|E
60|$|On {{occasions}} {{of general}} interest, {{such as the}} University contests, or races for the championship, {{we used to go}} up to the club-room, and out into the long balcony looking over the river; and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> to see the river crowded with steamers, and the excited crowd on the towing-path, and to hear the burst of cheering which broke out when they started. But it was only the start we saw, and not even always that--for the steamers often got in our way--so that, on the whole, I enjoyed the club races far more than these great contests.|$|E

60|$|Well, I {{was in for}} the {{business}} and must follow it to the finish whatever that might be.

For being pretty well fever-proof I did not think I should die in that morass, as of course nine white men out of ten would have done, and, beyond it lay the huge mountain which day by day grew larger and clearer.|$|E
6000|$|... "The plan I had in {{mind was}} to go and carry books and papers {{to the people in}} hospitals, as one of Mamma's friends has done for years. I went once to the City Hospital with her, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting,</b> but I didn't dare to go to the grown people all alone, so I went to the Children's Hospital, and soon loved to help amuse the poor little dears. I saved all the picture-books and papers I could find for them, dressed dolls, and mended toys, and got new ones, and made bibs and night-gowns, and felt like the mother of a large family.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Steerforth was {{particularly}} happy in her son's society, and Steerforth was, on this occasion, particularly attentive and respectful to her. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> <b>interesting</b> {{to me to}} see them together, not only on account of their mutual affection, {{but because of the}} strong personal resemblance between them, {{and the manner in which}} what was haughty or impetuous in him was softened by age and sex, in her, to a gracious dignity. I thought, more than once, that it was well no serious cause of division had ever come between them; or two such natures--I ought rather to express it, two such shades of the same nature--might have been harder to reconcile than the two extremest opposites in creation. The idea did not originate in my own discernment, I am bound to confess, but in a speech of Rosa Dartle's.|$|E
