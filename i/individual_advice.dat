5|$|English astrology {{had reached}} its zenith by the 17th century. Astrologers were theorists, researchers, and social engineers, {{as well as}} {{providing}} <b>individual</b> <b>advice</b> to everyone from monarchs downwards.

30|$|There {{were some}} {{limitations}} in our study. Firstly, {{due to the}} retrospective design, recall bias was unavoidable {{and we did not}} contain the medical history of warfarin, aspirin and NSAIDs. For example, patients may have misremembered the anticoagulant they used and duration of prophylaxis. The diagnosis of VTE was based on patient’s symptoms and physician’s judgment, thus may underestimated the VTE rate. Additionally, the definition of compliance was established on the extension to 35 days thromboprophylaxis as recommended by ACCP 9 guideline. However, we could not treat all patients as same situation because some patients were received <b>individual</b> <b>advices</b> by their doctors.|$|R

This always includes interviews with experts and survivors of similar disasters. On occasion the show may describe two or more different scenarios within the same disaster (being caught at different distances from a nuclear blast, being held under different circumstances during a home invasion/hostage situation or escaping different pandemics). In these cases, Courtley still participates as a member of both scenario groups simultaneously.|$|R

50|$|In {{terms of}} <b>individual</b> <b>advice,</b> the Xiang’er, {{like the rest}} of Daoism, {{discusses}} ways in which a person could gain immortality. According to the Xiang’er, the body was inhabited by spirits that survive in the presence of qi. In order to attain immortality, a person had to preserve and nourish these internal spirits. Presumably these spirits could be nurtured through meditation, but the Xiang’er offers very little guidance on what type of meditation one should do. The Xiang’er also looks down upon Daoist sexual practices, and urges its readers not to practice them.|$|E

5000|$|The committee's [...] "eat less" [...] {{recommendations}} triggered strong {{negative reactions}} from the cattle, dairy, egg, and sugar industries, including from McGovern's home state.

[...] Some scientists also thought the committee's conclusions needed further expert review. [...] Others felt that the job of promulgating recommendations belonged to the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council. [...] Under heavy pressure, the committee held further hearings, and issued a revised set of guidelines in late 1977 which adjusted some of the advice regarding salt and cholesterol and watered down the wording regarding meat consumption.|$|E

40|$|This is a {{study on}} the outcome of the Swedish Forest Agency´s mission to provide <b>individual</b> <b>advice</b> to private land owners about precommercial thinning. The study was {{conducted}} in Sala municipality and included forest owners that had received private <b>individual</b> <b>advice</b> from a Swedish Forest Agency consultant as well as forest owners that had not received <b>individual</b> <b>advice.</b> One of the central issues was to make comparisons between these two groups. The survey was carried out by telephone interviews combined with a smaller field study. The questions were designed to provide information about to what degree the forest owners had been affected by the advice and {{if there had been a}} change in the way in which precommercial thinning was performed. In terms of the amount of precommercial thinning that had been carried out, no statistically significant differences were found between the two groups. The field study indicated that in some cases less precommerical thinning had been performed in the field than originally stated by the property owner. Additional information obtained during the telephone survey indicated that the private <b>individual</b> <b>advice</b> had influenced forest owners in terms of how they performed precommercial thinning. Despite no statistically significant differences between the two studied groups regarding the amount of precommercial thinning performed, several forest owners answered that they would not have carried out their precommercial thinning operations at all if they had not been contacted and offered private <b>individual</b> <b>advice...</b>|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Examination {{of tobacco}} butts and its {{possible}} use in tobacco control. DESIGN: Macroscopic examination of cigarette butts collected outside or in dedicated smoking rooms of a smoke-free hospital. RESULTS: Of 925 butts, 3. 8 % were cigarillos, 11. 1 % cigarettes without filter, 57. 7 % ventilated filter cigarettes, 22. 5 % filter cigarettes without macroscopic ventilation and 4. 9 % undetermined. Thirty-six different cigarette brands were identified. A wide distribution of butt lengths (mean 32. 1 mm, variation coefficient 28 %), peripheral ovalisation of the filter in 83. 9 %, and extended browning {{of the mouth}} end of the filter in 48. 6 % were observed. Vent holes were macroscopically detectable in 70. 5 % and a sharp decrease in browning in 53. 4 % of the filter cigarettes. Most (94. 7 %) ventilation holes were located at > or = 10 mm from the mouth end. CONCLUSIONS: In a smoke-free hospital, the use of tobacco products (mainly ventilated filter cigarettes) remains sizeable. Given the wide distribution of butt lengths, the number of cigarettes per day is a poor marker of toxin intake. Vent-hole localisation and signs of vent-blocking confirm the inadequacy of machine-measured smoke yields {{and the presence of}} compensatory smoking. More intensive <b>individual</b> cessation <b>advice</b> with pharmacological support is necessary. Examination of a smoker's own cigarette butts {{can be used as a}} tool for <b>individual</b> cessation <b>advice...</b>|$|R

We have to ask ourselves whether this situation is typical of virtual universities or rather typical for institutions with a bureaucratic administration.

40|$|Additive Manufacturing Technology {{offers a}} unique design {{flexibility}} {{due to its}} layer based construction approach. This provides a new potential for lightweight construction. Bionic lightweight structures, integrated functionality and topology optimized structures are now possible to be manufactured.

Ergonomic workplace design can benefit from this technology, through individualized lightweight design, like handling tools for example. Baraldi and Kaminski could show benefits to the worker and the company, resulting on ergonomic workstations in the assembly line. The company benefits by improved productivity, product quality and workers' quality of live. The workers don't overstress their body and do better work with higher motivation and less sickness.
