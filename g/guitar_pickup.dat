25|$|The Dean From Hell guitar had Bill Lawrence pickups. The Seymour Duncan <b>guitar</b> <b>pickup</b> {{company made}} a {{signature}} pickup called the Dimebucker, {{modeled after the}} Bill Lawrence original L-500XL pickups. After Dean guitars' demise in 1994 he signed with Washburn, going back to Dean again in 2004. He was buried with a Charvel guitar which was owned by Eddie Van Halen.|$|E
25|$|A re-amping device {{commonly}} {{employs a}} reversed Direct Inject (DI) transformer with some resistors added for level and impedance shift. Level and impedance adjustment {{can be achieved}} by adding a potentiometer or adjustable resistor. A proper re-amping device converts a balanced signal to an unbalanced signal, reduces a high studio-level (line-level) signal down to a low guitar-level signal, and shifts the output to a high instrument-level impedance (typically a <b>guitar</b> <b>pickup</b> impedance).|$|E

500|$|According to Guitar Player magazine, Jones {{does not}} rely on any one {{particular}} guitar-playing technique but rather combines many techniques. For example, Allmusic wrote that he [...] "alternately utiliz power chords, scratchy noise, chiming arpeggios, and a quiet minimalism" [...] in [...] "Sober". Additionally, the band uses forms of instrumental experimentation, like {{the use of a}} [...] "pipe bomb microphone" [...] (a <b>guitar</b> <b>pickup</b> mounted inside a brass cylinder) and a talk box guitar solo on [...] "Jambi".|$|E
500|$|The band briefly {{considered}} self-producing, {{but were}} pressured by Geffen {{to choose a}} producer. They ultimately decided on Ric Ocasek; Cuomo explained his choice: [...] "I'd always admired The Cars and Ric Ocasek's songwriting and production skills." [...] During production, Ocasek convinced the band to change their <b>guitar</b> <b>pickup</b> from the neck pick-up to the bridge pick-up, resulting in a brighter sound. During these sessions, founding guitarist Jason Cropper left the band {{and was replaced by}} current guitarist Brian Bell, leading to some speculation about how much Bell contributed to the album. While Bell's vocals are clearly audible on some tracks, Cuomo re-recorded all of Cropper's guitar parts. According to Ocasek, all ten tracks were laid down by Cuomo in one day, each in one take. However, Bell is still credited for playing guitar in the album liner notes. Cropper's writing credit on [...] "My Name Is Jonas" [...] is earned by his coming up with the intro to the song.|$|E
2500|$|External effects such as stomp {{boxes and}} guitar multi-fx {{processors}} {{can also be}} included in the re-amping process.

2500|$|In {{conventional}} re-amplification, a dry recorded {{signal is}} sent into a balanced XLR input. An unbalanced ¼" [...] (Tip-Sleeve) phone connector is typically {{used for the}} output, which {{is connected to the}} guitar amp rig. Some re-amping devices offer a pad (attenuator) switch to reduce a too-hot output level. Sometimes a guitar volume pedal or buffered effects pedal can work adequately for re-amping, depending on grounding, levels, and impedance. Another approach to simulating the high impedance of a <b>guitar</b> <b>pickup</b> is to use a passive DI and add a 10 K-ohm resistor in series with the signal connection inside a 1/4" [...] plug.|$|E
2500|$|The P-90 (sometimes written P90) is {{a single}} coil {{electric}} <b>guitar</b> <b>pickup</b> produced by Gibson since 1946. Gibson is still producing P-90s, and there are outside companies that manufacture replacement versions. [...] Compared to other single coil designs, such as the ubiquitous Fender single coil, the bobbin for a P-90 is wider but shorter. [...] The Fender style single coil is wound in a taller bobbin but the wires are closer to the individual poles. [...] This makes the P-90 produce {{a different type of}} tone, somewhat warmer with less edge and brightness. [...] The P-90 is still subject to 60 cycle hum unless some form of hum cancelling is used.|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} at O'Henry Studios in Burbank, California, {{as well as}} at The Loft and Grandmaster Studios in Hollywood, California. It was mixed at Bay 7 in North Hollywood, CA and mastered at Gateway Mastering Studios in Portland, Maine. The June 2006 issue of Guitar World (released April 11, 2006) featured an interview with guitarist Adam Jones discussing the new album. Jones explained that recording techniques for the album involved the use of a [...] "pipe bomb microphone" [...] (a <b>guitar</b> <b>pickup</b> mounted inside a brass cylinder), and a talk box guitar solo on the song [...] "Jambi". The [...] "pipe bomb microphone" [...] and other studio related information was further detailed in the June 1, 2006 issue of Mix. Drummer Danny Carey operated many of the sound effects on the interlude tracks on the album using electronic drums called Mandalas.|$|E

50|$|Lundgren <b>Guitar</b> <b>Pickups</b> is a Swedish {{manufacturer}} of guitar and bass <b>guitar</b> <b>pickups</b> formed in 1990 by Johan Lundgren and situated in Jönköping.

Along with their lineup of production pickups the company also custom makes, rewinds and repair older pickups. Pickups are available as single coils, humbuckers and P-90s wound with either formvar wire, plain enamel wire or polysol wires. Lundgrens PAF-style humbuckers are built after analyzing the originals from 1957 and 1958 and built with a vintage 1957 winding machine.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Guitar</b> <b>pickup</b> potting is {{a process}} whereby the fine wire coils of a <b>guitar</b> <b>pickup</b> are {{encapsulated}} in a substance that inhibits movement of the coil. [...] Guitar pickups are generally made from bobbins wrapped in many thousands of turns of fine wire. If the wire is left unpotted {{it is possible for}} unwanted microphonics or oscillations to occur, causing the pickup to [...] "howl". This is often apparent when using overdriven amplifiers and distortion pedals.Potting also protects the delicate winding from damage.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the mid-1950s}} Gibson looked {{to create a}} new <b>guitar</b> <b>pickup</b> {{different}} from existing popular single coil designs. Gibson had already developed the Charlie Christian pickup and P-90 in the 1930s and 40s; however, these designs—like competitor Fender's single-coil pickups—were fraught with inherent 60-cycle hum sound interference. Engineer and Gibson employee Seth Lover spent much of 1954 working on a noise-cancelling or [...] "hum-bucking" [...] <b>guitar</b> <b>pickup</b> design. By early 1955, the design was completed.
