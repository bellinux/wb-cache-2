With Mexico and the Republic of Korea it forms the <b>Environmental</b> <b>Integrity</b> Group (EIG). The country is heavily active in recycling and anti-littering regulations and is one of the top recyclers in the world, with 66% to 96% of recyclable materials being recycled, depending on the area of the country. The 2014 Global Green Economy Index ranked Switzerland among the top 10 green economies in the world.|$|E
5|$|An {{emissions}} trading scheme for {{greenhouse gas emissions}} (GHGs) works by establishing property rights for the atmosphere. The atmosphere is a global public good, and GHG emissions are an international externality (p.21). The emissions from all sources of GHGs contribute to the overall stock of GHGs in the atmosphere. In the cap-and-trade variant of {{emissions trading}}, a limit on access to a resource (the cap) is defined and then allocated among users {{in the form of}} permits. Compliance is established by comparing actual emissions with permits surrendered including any permits traded within the cap. The <b>environmental</b> <b>integrity</b> of emissions trading is depends on the setting of the cap, not the decision to allow trading.|$|E

25|$|Biological testing {{involves}} the use of plant, animal or microbial indicators to monitor the health of an aquatic ecosystem. They are any biological species or group of species whose function, population, or status can reveal what degree of ecosystem or <b>environmental</b> <b>integrity</b> is present. One example of a group of bio-indicators are the copepods and other small water crustaceans that are present in many water bodies.

25|$|The rural tier {{has been}} the focus of orchestrated efforts by {{residents}} and county government to preserve its rural character and <b>environmental</b> <b>integrity.</b> Under the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission (M-NCPPC), Patuxent River Park is the largest natural preserve and provides public access for birdwatching and viewing the rural tier's natural waterfront vistas. In season, the park's Jug Bay Natural Area and the Patuxent Riverkeeper in Queen Anne both offer canoeing and kayaking rentals on the Patuxent. The county's largest collection of tobacco planter mansions and preserved homes are in the rural tier, some managed by the M-NCPPC. Many rural tier roads have scenic highway preservation status; a fall drive yields exceptional beauty along the Patuxent valley's Leeland Road, Croom Road, Clagett's Landing Rd., Mill Branch Rd., Queen Anne Rd., and Brandywine Rd. Walking access along roads in this area is very limited, because most property along the roads remains in private ownership. However, walking is much more accessible in the widespread M-NCPPC lands and trails and state holdings in the Patuxent valley, such as Merkle Wildlife Sanctuary and Rosaryville State Park, both popular among hikers and mountain bikers.|$|E

40|$|Critical {{infrastructure}} (CI) {{has received}} much attention in research, policy and political discussions in recent years, following concern over exposure of infrastructure to terrorist attack, disruption through disasters, rising {{awareness of the}} interdependent nature of infrastructure in modern urban systems, {{and changes in the}} ownership of and responsibility for infrastructure assets. In this paper, we explore the implications of different framings of both "critical" and "infrastructure", through two questions: critical how and for whom; critical when and at what scale? Framings of CI, and their increasingly important manifestations in policy and law, have deep but too-often unexposed implications: the lines drawn between what is defined as critical and that which is not concerns not only the physical or informational assets, but the inclusion/exclusion of communities and their places and values as important aspects of modern urban governance. We argue that a better understanding of what is critical about urban infrastructure is not just recognition of their vulnerability and interconnectedness, but also of the key linkages between critical infrastructure and human and <b>environmental</b> system <b>integrity</b> and equity within the context of capitalist urbanisation...|$|R

The deposit-refund model of Central Allocation is an alternative to the distribution of emission permits actually discussed in the context of flexible mechanisms.

Three basic principles were derived: “freedom from want” related to economic and environmental conditions, “freedom from instability” as determined by social and political issues, and “freedom from fear,” meaning freedom from war, terrorism and aggressiveness, and related also to the integrity of the private sphere. These general principles manifest themselves differently in different countries determined by specific political, social, cultural, and economic context...|$|R

It emphasises that the <b>environmental</b> and economic <b>integrity</b> of the European Union’s measures is of crucial importance {{due to the fact that}} the European Union’s leadership in global climate legislation is highly dependent on it and also since the European Union’s legislation has already served and is likely to continue serving as a model for similar cap and trade systems worldwide. The paper concludes that the current regulation of carbon leakage in the European Union leads to the overprotection of sectors which are considered to be exposed to a significant risk of carbon leakage and that further revisions of the system are necessary...|$|R

This assessment is informed by interviews with Antarctic tourism stakeholders and a Delphi study undertaken in 2007. The authors found that Antarctic tourism stakeholders are concerned about the increasing scale and diversification of Antarctic tourism and generally subscribe to a conservation imperative when expressing their hopes for the future use of Antarctica and the development of Antarctic tourism. In conclusion, the rapid development of Antarctic tourism requires structural, institutional and legislative changes if Antarctic tourism regulation is to remain successful...|$|R
