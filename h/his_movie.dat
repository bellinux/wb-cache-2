5|$|On November 29, 1934, {{while the}} rest of the team was playing in Omiya, Berg went to Saint Luke's Hospital in Tsukiji, ostensibly to visit the {{daughter}} of American ambassador Joseph Grew.

He never did see the ambassador's daughter. Back at home, the Indians gave him his unconditional release. Berg continued on to the Philippines, Korea and Moscow.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{took over}} as {{production}} head after Selznick's departure and oversaw two hits starring Hepburn: Morning Glory (1933), for which she won her first Oscar, and Little Women (1933), director Cukor's second collaboration with the actress. Among the studio's in-house productions, the latter was the biggest box-office success of the decade. Ginger Rogers had already made several minor films for RKO when Cooper signed her to a seven-year contract and cast her in the big-budget musical Flying Down to Rio (1933). Rogers was paired with Astaire, making <b>his</b> <b>movie</b> debut. Billed fourth and fifth respectively, the picture turned them into stars.

5|$|MGM lent Tracy to Twentieth Century-Fox for the Western film Broken Lance, {{his only}} {{appearance}} of 1954. The picture was well received. In 1955 Tracy turned down William Wyler's The Desperate Hours because {{he refused to}} take second-billing to Humphrey Bogart. Instead, Tracy appeared as a one-armed protagonist who faces the hostility {{of a small town}} in Bad Day at Black Rock (1955), a film directed by John Sturges. For his work, Tracy received a fifth Oscar nomination and was awarded the Best Actor prize at the Cannes Film Festival. He had personally been unhappy with the picture, and threatened to leave it during production. This behavior became a regular occurrence for the aging Tracy, who was increasingly lethargic and cynical. He began production on Tribute to a Bad Man in the summer of 1955, but pulled out when the location shooting in Colorado gave him altitude sickness. The trouble caused by the picture fractured Tracy's relationship with MGM. In June 1955 he was the last remaining star of the studio's heyday, but with his contract up for renewalâ€”Tracy opted to go independent {{for the first time in}} <b>his</b> <b>movie</b> career.|$|E
5|$|Malick {{spent years}} working on other projects, {{including}} a stage production of Sansho the Bailiff and a script known as The English-Speaker, spending $2 {{million of the}} producers' money, half of which for writing. In 1990, he met with James Jones' widow Gloria and his daughter Kaylie about adapting The Thin Red Line into a film. By January 1995, Geisler and Roberdeau were broke and pressured Malick to decide which one he would complete. They approached Malick's former agent, Mike Medavoy, who was setting up his own production company, Phoenix Pictures, and he agreed to give them $100,000 to start work on The Thin Red Line. Medavoy had a deal with Sony Pictures and Malick began scouting locations in Panama and Costa Rica before settling on the rain forests of northern Australia. In April 1997, three months before filming, Sony pulled the plug while crews were building the sets in Queensland, because new studio chairman John Calley did not think Malick could make <b>his</b> <b>movie</b> with the proposed $52 million budget. Malick traveled to Los Angeles with Medavoy to pitch the project to various studios. 20th Century Fox agreed to put up $39 million of the budget with the stipulation that Malick cast five movie stars {{from a list of}} 10 who were interested. Pioneer Films, a Japanese company, contributed $8 million to the budget, and Phoenix added $3 million.|$|E

50|$|The {{most notable}} {{achievement}} in Bapu's <b>movie</b> making is <b>his</b> success in capturing the nativity of the Telugu people and translating it into visuals. <b>His</b> <b>movies</b> center on realistic family issues and relationships, however his recurring theme is magic realism, with vignettes of mythological characters aiding in the narration. Most of <b>his</b> <b>movies</b> have a female protagonist; a breakaway style from the formulaic movies that relegate female lead characters to {{song and dance}} numbers. His penchant for preserving the Telugu nativity in <b>his</b> <b>movies</b> {{can be seen in}} the choice of artists, especially the dusky female leads and weak villains.|$|R
50|$|In {{comparison}} with his stand-up comedy and TV dramas, <b>his</b> <b>movies</b> {{are not as}} successful. When being asked the reasons behind, he explained that his {{ultimate goal is to}} look for something new in <b>his</b> <b>movies.</b> <b>His</b> visions makes his work good to watch, but it is not good enough to attract people to pay for a cinema ticket. The second reason is that he hates doing promotion for his work.|$|R
5|$|Mariam {{lives in}} a kolba on the {{outskirts}} of Herat with her embittered mother. Jalil, her father, is a wealthy businessman who owns a cinema and lives in the town with three wives and nine children. Mariam is his illegitimate daughter, and she is prohibited to live with them, but Jalil visits her every Thursday. On her fifteenth birthday, Mariam wants her father to take her to see Pinocchio at <b>his</b> <b>movie</b> theater, against the pleas of her mother. When he does not show up, she hikes into town and goes to his house. He refuses to see her, and she ends up sleeping on the street. In the morning, Mariam returns home to find that her mother has committed suicide out of fear that her daughter had deserted her. Mariam is then taken to live in her father's house. Jalil arranges for her to be married to Rasheed, a shoemaker from Kabul who is thirty-years her senior. In Kabul, Mariam becomes pregnant seven successive times, but is never able to carry a child to term. This is a sad, disquieting reality for both Rasheed and Mariam. Ultimately Rasheed grows more and more despondent over his wife's inability to have a child and particularly a son. As their marriage wears on Rasheed gradually becomes more and more abusive.|$|E
5|$|Johnson began {{thinking}} of life after basketball while still {{playing with the}} Lakers. He wondered why so many athletes had failed at business, and sought advice. During his seventh season in the NBA, he {{had a meeting with}} Michael Ovitz, CEO of Creative Artists Agency. Ovitz encouraged him to start reading business magazines and to use every connection available to him. Johnson learned everything he could about business, often meeting with corporate executives during road trips. Johnson's first foray into business, a high-end sporting goods store named Magic 32, failed after only one year, costing him $200,000. The experience taught him to listen to his customers and find out what products they wanted. Johnson has become a leading voice on how to invest in urban communities, creating redevelopment opportunities in underserved areas, most notably through <b>his</b> <b>movie</b> theaters and his partnership with Starbucks. He went to Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz with the idea that he could successfully open the coffee shops in urban areas. After showing Schultz the tremendous buying power of minorities, Johnson was able to purchase 125 Starbucks stores, which reported higher than average per capita sales. The partnership, called Urban Coffee Opportunities, placed Starbucks in locations such as Detroit, Washington, D.C., Harlem, and the Crenshaw District of Los Angeles. Johnson sold his remaining interest in the stores back to the company in 2010, ending a successful twelve-year partnership. Johnson has also invested in urban California real estate and financial service companies catering to America's underserved markets via his Canyon-Johnson and Yucaipa-Johnson funds. Another major project is with Chicago-based Aon Corp., an insurance services company is designed to promote minority businesses. In 2006-07, Johnson was part of a syndicate that bought the Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower, then the tallest building in Brooklyn, for $71 million and converted the 512-foot high landmark structure from an office building into luxury condominiums.|$|E
