5|$|Mysteries of the Sith {{includes}} fifteen multiplayer maps, four {{of which}} only allow players to battle with lightsabers. The player can choose an avatar and the lightsaber color, and compete {{with up to}} seven other players over the internet or a local area network. The game includes a ranking system that tracks the player's experience. Multiplayer mode allows the use of pre-set characters featured in both Mysteries of the Sith and Dark Forces II. There is also a choice of characters from the Star Wars films, such as Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader and Boba Fett. Each type of character <b>has</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>and</b> <b>disadvantages.</b>|$|E
5|$|Iridion 3D {{features}} five {{types of}} weapons, with {{three levels of}} power each. Players boost weapon power by collecting powerups of the color that matches the current weapon. Collecting a different color gives the player the first level of that weapon type. If the player's ship is destroyed the power level of the weapon is reduced by one. Each weapon <b>has</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>and</b> <b>disadvantages.</b> The player starts with the red weapon, which is relatively weak but fires rapidly in a large spread. Green weapons are inaccurate but fill the screen with shots. Purple weapons spin in a counterclockwise motion slowly and are fairly strong. Yellow torpedo-like weapons are very powerful but powerups are rare and the weapon fires slowly. Blue weapons, a more powerful version of Yellow weapons, are found only on the last level. Flashing powerups restore the craft's shields.|$|E

25|$|Each grip <b>has</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>and</b> <b>disadvantages.</b> Holding {{the knife}} {{in one of the}} forward grips allows for more finesse and a longer reach, while a reverse grip allows for more power. The reverse grip is {{regarded}} as more difficult to master in knife-on-knife combat, as it may require additional skills in footwork and rapid defensive body movements to offset the increased danger of moving closer to one's opponent and the reach of his/her blade.|$|E
25|$|In mass spectrometry, {{ionization}} {{refers to}} the production of gas phase ions suitable for resolution in the mass analyser or mass filter. Ionization occurs in the ion source. There are several ion sources available; each <b>has</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>and</b> <b>disadvantages</b> for particular applications. For example, electron ionization (EI) gives a high degree of fragmentation, yielding highly detailed mass spectra which when skilfully analysed can provide important information for structural elucidation/characterisation and facilitate identification of unknown compounds by comparison to mass spectral libraries obtained under identical operating conditions. However, EI is not suitable for coupling to HPLC, i.e. LC-MS, since at atmospheric pressure, the filaments used to generate electrons burn out rapidly. Thus EI is coupled predominantly with GC, i.e. GC-MS, where the entire system is under high vacuum.|$|E
25|$|Knife blades can be {{manufactured}} {{from a variety}} of materials, each of which <b>has</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>and</b> <b>disadvantages.</b> Carbon steel, an alloy of iron and carbon, can be very sharp. It holds its edge well, and remains easy to sharpen, but is vulnerable to rust and stains. Stainless steel is an alloy of iron, chromium, possibly nickel, and molybdenum, with only a small amount of carbon. It is not able to take quite as sharp an edge as carbon steel, but is highly resistant to corrosion. High carbon stainless steel is stainless steel with a higher amount of carbon, intended to incorporate the better attributes of carbon steel and stainless steel. High carbon stainless steel blades do not discolor or stain, and maintain a sharp edge. Laminate blades use multiple metals to create a layered sandwich, combining the attributes of both. For example, a harder, more brittle steel may be sandwiched between an outer layer of softer, tougher, stainless steel to reduce vulnerability to corrosion. In this case, however, the part most affected by corrosion, the edge, is still vulnerable. Pattern-welding is similar to laminate construction. Layers of different steel types are welded together, but then the stock is manipulated to create patterns in the steel.|$|E

500|$|Subwoofers {{have been}} {{designed}} using a number of enclosure approaches: bass reflex, acoustic suspension, infinite baffle, horn loaded, tapped horn, transmission line and bandpass. Each enclosure type <b>has</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>and</b> <b>disadvantages</b> in efficiency increase, bass extension, cabinet size, distortion, and cost. Subwoofers are typically constructed by mounting one or more woofers in a cabinet of medium-density fibreboard (MDF), oriented strand board (OSB), plywood, fiberglass, aluminum or other stiff materials. [...] Because of the high air pressure they produce in the cabinet, subwoofer enclosures often require internal bracing to distribute the resulting forces.|$|E
500|$|The {{player can}} play as either Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine and each {{character}} <b>has</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>and</b> <b>disadvantages.</b> For example, Chris can take and deal more damage than Jill but Jill can carry more items and unlock certain doors with a lock pick. Both characters can equip defensive weapons {{that can save}} them from taking damage when seized by an enemy. These defensive weapons include a dagger and a special weapon that is exclusive to each of them: Jill can use a taser, while Chris is able to shove stun grenades into the zombies' mouths and detonate them with a pistol shot. Defensive weapons are limited and can only be used when the player is grabbed by a monster.|$|E
500|$|Machinima <b>has</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>and</b> <b>disadvantages</b> when {{compared}} to other styles of filmmaking. Its relative simplicity over traditional frame-based animation limits control and range of expression. Its real-time nature favors speed, cost saving, and flexibility over the higher quality of pre-rendered computer animation. Virtual acting is less expensive, dangerous, and physically restricted than live action. Machinima can be filmed by relying on in-game artificial intelligence (AI) or by controlling characters and cameras through digital puppetry. [...] Scenes can be precisely scripted, and can be manipulated during post-production using video editing techniques. Editing, custom software, and creative cinematography may address technical limitations. Game companies have provided software for and have encouraged machinima, but the widespread use of digital assets from copyrighted games has resulted in complex, unresolved legal issues.|$|E

500|$|The player {{commands}} {{different types}} of followers, each of which <b>has</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>and</b> <b>disadvantages</b> in combat. The most basic unit is the Brave, which builds huts, towers, and military buildings. Braves are trained to become other units: tough melee Warriors; weak, long-range, Firewarriors; Preachers, who convert enemy units and prevent enemy preachers from converting friendly troops; and Spies, who perform espionage functions. Shamans are physically weaker than warriors, but can cast powerful spells and can be reincarnated if killed. Some spells will disappear after use. Other spells can slowly be replenished for continued use; the rate of spell regeneration depends upon the player's number of followers. Examples of spells include [...] "Landbridge", which raises the sea floor to create bridges across the sea; [...] "Swarm", which sends a horde of insects to sow confusion in enemy ranks; and [...] "Tornado", which creates a cyclone to destroy buildings. There are twenty-six spells in total, which are slowly learned throughout the campaign.|$|E
2500|$|Treatment of Graves' disease {{includes}} antithyroid drugs which {{reduce the}} production of thyroid hormone; radioiodine (radioactive iodine I-131); and thyroidectomy (surgical excision of the gland). As operating on a frankly hyperthyroid patient is dangerous, prior to thyroidectomy, preoperative treatment with antithyroid drugs is given to render the patient [...] "euthyroid" [...] (i.e. normothyroid). Each of these treatments <b>has</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>and</b> <b>disadvantages.</b> No one treatment approach is considered the best for everyone.|$|E
2500|$|Mooring {{lines are}} usually made from manila rope or a {{synthetic}} material such as nylon. Nylon {{is easy to}} work with and lasts for years, but it is highly elastic. This elasticity <b>has</b> <b>advantages</b> <b>and</b> <b>disadvantages.</b> The main advantage is that during an event, such as a high wind or the close passing of another ship, stress can be spread across several lines. However, should a highly stressed nylon line break, it may part catastrophically, causing snapback, which can fatally injure bystanders. The effect of snapback is analogous to stretching a rubber band to its breaking point between your hands and then suffering a stinging blow from its suddenly flexing broken ends. Such a blow from a heavy mooring line carries much more force and can inflict severe injuries or even sever limbs. [...] Mooring lines made from materials such as Dyneema and Kevlar have much less elasticity and are therefore much safer to use. However, such lines do not float on water and they do tend to sink. In addition, they are relatively more expensive than other sorts of line.|$|E
