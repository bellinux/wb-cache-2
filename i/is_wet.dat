5|$|Jerold J. Abrams and Elizabeth F. Cooke, in {{the book}} The Philosophy of TV Noir argue that the episode {{stresses}} abductive reasoning, a type of logic that goes from data or a description of something to a hypothesis that accounts for the reliable data and seeks to explain relevant evidence. Abductive reasoning follows the logic: a surprising fact, C, is observed (Result); If A, the hypothesis, were true, C would make perfect sense (Rule); Thus, {{there is reason to}} suspect that A is true (Case). An example that has been given is: the lawn <b>is</b> <b>wet.</b> But if it is raining, then it would be unsurprising that the lawn <b>is</b> <b>wet.</b> Therefore, it is raining. This logical method is favored by Mulder throughout most of the show. In this episode, however, it is Scully who first uses the method. She takes three separate facts—the massive size of some types of mushrooms, the hallucinogenic properties of some fungi, and the carnivorous nature of certain types of plants—and formulates an abductive conclusion: she and Mulder are trapped underground, experiencing a hallucination, and slowly being digested.|$|E
5|$|Salta, {{like the}} rest of the Solway plain, has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate {{classification}} Cfb), with warm summers and cool winters which generally avoid extremes of temperature. Salta has a cool climate, with average daytime highs of around 19°C during July and 7°C during December, although lows of −12°C have been recorded. It <b>is</b> <b>wet</b> all year round, with rain or drizzle expected on 16 to 19 days of most months. Snowfall is relatively uncommon.|$|E

5|$|Vildanden AS ("The Wild Duck") was a virtual, {{regional}} airline {{based at}} Skien Airport, Geiteryggen in Norway, {{where it was}} the only airline. With operations starting in 2005, it flew to Bergen, Trondheim and Stavanger using a Jetstream 32 and an ATR 42, which <b>is</b> <b>wet</b> leased from Danish Air Transport (DAT) and Helitrans. Previously, the airline has also served Stockholm and Molde, and has also operated Saab 340 aircraft, operated by Coast Air, Air Aurora and Avitrans. The airline hadbeen in conflict with Coast Air about terminating the wet lease agreement. The company has had to be bailed out several times, including by the municipality, until it managed to make its first profit in 2009. It ceased operations and filed for bankruptcy in January 2011.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic {{ash fall}} is physically, socially, and {{economically}} disruptive. Volcanic ash can affect both proximal areas and areas {{many hundreds of}} kilometres from the source, and causes disruptions and losses {{in a wide variety}} of different infrastructure sectors. Impacts are dependent on: ash fall thickness; the duration of the ash fall; the grain size and chemistry of the ash; whether the ash <b>is</b> <b>wet</b> or dry; and any preparedness, management and prevention (mitigation) measures employed to reduce effects from the ash fall. Different sectors of infrastructure and society are affected in different ways and are vulnerable to a range of impacts or consequences. These are discussed in the following sections.|$|E
5|$|Damage to {{buildings}} and structures can range from complete or partial roof collapse to less catastrophic damage of exterior and internal materials. Impacts depend on the thickness of ash, whether it <b>is</b> <b>wet</b> or dry, the roof and building design and how much ash gets inside a building. The specific weight of ash can vary significantly and rain can increase this by 50-100%. Problems associated with ash loading are {{similar to that of}} snow; however, ash is more severe as 1) the load from ash is generally much greater, 2) ash does not melt and 3) ash can clog and damage gutters, especially after rain fall. Impacts for ash loading depend on building design and construction, including roof slope, construction materials, roof span and support system, and age and maintenance of the building. Generally flat roofs are more susceptible to damage and collapse than steeply pitched roofs. Roofs made of smooth materials (sheet metal or glass) are more likely to shed ash than roofs made with rough materials (thatch, asphalt or wood shingles). Roof collapse can lead to widespread injuries and deaths and property damage. For example, the collapse of roofs from ash during the 15 June 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption killed about 300 people.|$|E

25|$|A {{disposable}} diaper {{may also}} include an inner fabric {{designed to hold}} moisture against the skin {{for a brief period}} before absorption to alert a toilet training or bedwetting user that they have urinated. Most materials in the diaper are held together {{with the use of a}} hot-melt adhesive, which is applied in spray form or multi lines, an elastic hot melt is also used to help with pad integrity when the diaper <b>is</b> <b>wet.</b>|$|E
25|$|Under Law 42, {{subsection}} 3 of the Laws of Cricket, the ball may be polished {{without the use}} of an artificial substance, may be dried with a towel if it <b>is</b> <b>wet,</b> and have mud removed from it under supervision; all other actions which alter the condition of the ball are illegal. These are usually taken to include rubbing the ball on the ground, scuffing with a fingernail or other sharp object, or tampering with the seam of the ball.|$|E
25|$|When moist, laterites {{can easily}} be cut with a spade into regular-sized blocks. Laterite is mined while it is below the water table, so it <b>is</b> <b>wet</b> and soft. Upon {{exposure}} to air it gradually hardens as the moisture between the flat clay particles evaporates and the larger iron salts lock into a rigid lattice structure and become resistant to atmospheric conditions. The art of quarrying laterite material into masonry is suspected to have been introduced from the Indian subcontinent.|$|E

25|$|The Pacific Northwest has a oceanic climate. The climate <b>is</b> <b>wet</b> {{and cool}} in autumn, winter, and spring, and stable and drier {{in the summer}} months, {{especially}} July and August. On average, the wettest month is typically November or December; the driest, July. In the summer months, average highs in cities like Seattle and Portland are from 70 to 79°F (21 to 26°C) with lows from 50 to 59°F (10 to 15°C), while in winter daily highs are from 40 to 49°F (4 to 9°C) and overnight lows from 30 to 39°F (−1 to 4°C).|$|E
25|$|Other common {{features}} of disposable diapers include {{one or more}} pairs of either adhesive or mechanical fastening tapes to keep the diaper securely fastened. Some diapers have tapes which are refastenable to allow adjusting of fit or reapplication after inspection. Elasticized fabric single and double gussets around the leg and waist areas aid in fitting and in containing urine or stool {{which has not been}} absorbed. Some diapers lines now commonly include wetness indicators, in which a chemical included in the fabric of the diaper changes color in the presence of moisture to alert the carer or user that the diaper <b>is</b> <b>wet.</b>|$|E
25|$|The chief {{difficulty}} with {{this model is}} that no martian climate simulation can reliably simulate a warm, wet Noachian, {{largely due to the}} distance between the sun and Mars compared to the Earth, and the inferred weaker Sun in the early solar system. Furthermore, a CO2-H2O greenhouse atmosphere to warm the climate should have left extensive deposits of carbonate rocks, which have not been found. Problems also exist with sustaining such an atmosphere for long enough to allow the valleys to form, as the unweathered basalts so prevalent on Mars should form extremely effective carbon sinks, especially if the surface <b>is</b> <b>wet,</b> and continuing impacts from space in Mars' early history should quickly strip any atmosphere away.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the city}} is by the sea, its climate is subject to drought in the summer. This {{is largely due to}} the dry {{south-west}} wind from Gulf of Thailand (this flow of wind <b>is</b> <b>wet</b> but when it passes to Vietnam, Annamite Range mountain range keeps its humidity to cause rains in Laos but drought in central Vietnam). It is rainy in the fall but the weather is comfortable with the temperature around 26 to 31 degrees Celsius. In the winter, due to the north-east wind blowing from the Chinese mainland, the temperature may go down below 18 degrees Celsius, and there may be slight rain. The highest precipitation gets highest level in August (118.4mm), compared to just 38.9mm in January.|$|E
25|$|Law 10: Covering the pitch. The {{pitch is}} said to be 'covered' when the groundsmen have placed covers on it to protect it against rain or dew. The Laws {{stipulate}} that the regulations on covering the pitch shall be agreed by both captains in advance. The decision concerning whether to cover the pitch greatly affects how the ball will react to the pitch surface, as a ball bounces differently on wet ground as compared to dry ground. The area beyond the pitch where a bowler runs so as to deliver the ball (the 'run-up') should ideally be kept dry so as to avoid injury through slipping and falling, and the Laws also require these to be covered wherever possible when there <b>is</b> <b>wet</b> weather.|$|E
25|$|In Sweden, farmers use dried peat {{to absorb}} {{excrement}} from cattle that are wintered indoors. The most important property of peat is retaining moisture in container soil {{when it is}} dry while preventing the excess of water from killing roots when it <b>is</b> <b>wet.</b> Peat can store nutrients {{although it is not}} fertile itself– it is polyelectrolytic with a high ion-exchange capacity due to its oxidized lignin. Peat is discouraged as a soil amendment by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, England, since 2003. While bark-based peat-free potting soil mixes are on the rise, particularly in the U.K., peat remains an important raw material for horticulture in Canada, as well as parts of the United States. However, it is recommended to treat peat thermally, e.g., through soil steaming in order to kill pests and reactivate nutrients.|$|E
