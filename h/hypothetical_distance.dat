50|$|Construal level theory (CLT) is {{a theory}} in social {{psychology}} that describes the relation between psychological distance {{and the extent to}} which people's thinking (e.g., about objects and events) is abstract or concrete. The general idea is that the more distant an object is from the individual, the more abstract it will be thought of, while the closer the object is, the more concretely it will be thought of. In CLT, psychological distance is defined on several dimensions—temporal, spatial, social and <b>hypothetical</b> <b>distance</b> being considered most important, though there is some debate among social psychologists about further dimensions like informational, experiential or affective distance.|$|E
40|$|College males’ uptake {{of human}} {{papilloma}} virus (HPV) vaccination is low. Prior research indicates perceived susceptibility to HPV among college males is also low. Construal level theory may offer a framework to alter perceived susceptibility and intention to vaccinate, but {{little research has}} examined this potential. Construal level theory provides foundational elements including that low construal level of perceptions is associated with more proximal psychological distance (hypothetical, social, temporal and spatial). Research indicates a disparity in college males’ susceptibility estimates which suggests high <b>hypothetical</b> <b>distance.</b> A reduction in <b>hypothetical</b> <b>distance</b> should be indicated by a measured increase in perceived susceptibility. Additionally, if construal level primed by messages is consistently associated with stage of change, then movement through stages of change might be promoted by influencing construal level such that perceived <b>hypothetical</b> <b>distance</b> is reduced. Additionally, the impact of interactivity on construal level and associated outcomes was explored. This study included two online experiments. In the first, a message was presented in components based on construal level dimensions. The second experiment was a 2 x 2, including high construal interactive message, low construal interactive message, high construal non-interactive message, and low construal non-interactive message conditions. The outcome variables of interest in both cases are <b>hypothetical</b> <b>distance,</b> barrier construal, stage of change and intention to vaccinate for HPV. Construal level dimensions did not offer explanatory value {{to the relationship between}} barriers and stage of change, a temporal measure of vaccination intention. However, the results indicate that perceptions of messages as lower construal are associated with increases in perceived susceptibility and intention to vaccinate for HPV. Perceived interactivity was associated with reduced social distance and increase in intention to vaccinate. This study suggests that construal level theory may be useful in the formative evaluations for HPV-related campaigns targeting males. This study also supports the addition of interactive elements to health campaigns, however the exact type of interactivity warrants further research. Limitations and directions for future research are discussed. ...|$|E

40|$|Predicting {{shifts of}} species {{geographical}} ranges {{is a fundamental}} challenge for conservation ecologists given the great complexity of factors involved in setting range limits. Distributional patterns are frequently modelled to "simplify" species responses to the environment, yet the central mechanisms that drive a particular pattern are rarely understood. We evaluated the distributions of two sandhopper species (Crustacea, Amphipoda, Talitridae), Talorchestia capensis and Africorchestia quadrispinosa along the Namibian and South African coasts, encompassing three biogeographic regions influenced by two different oceanographic systems, the Benguela and Agulhas currents. We aimed to test whether the Abundant Centre Hypothesis (ACH) can explain the distributions of these species' abundances, sizes and sex ratios and examined which environmental parameters influence/drive these distributions. Animals were collected during a once-off survey at 29 sites over c. 3500 km of coastline. The ACH was tested using a non-parametric constraint space analysis {{of the goodness of}} fit of five <b>hypothetical</b> models. <b>Distance</b> Based Linear Modelling (DistLM) was performed to evaluate which environmental traits influenced the distribution data. Abundance, size and sex ratio showed different patterns of distribution. A ramped model fitted the abundance (Ramped North) and size (Ramped South) distribution for A. quadrispinosa. The Inverse Quadratic model fitted the size distribution of T. capensis. Beach slope, salinity, sand temperature and percentage of detritus found on the shore at the time of collection played important roles in driving the abundance of A. quadrispinosa. T. capensis was mainly affected by salinity and the morphodynamic state of the beach. Our results provided only some support for the ACH predictions. The DistLM confirmed that the physical state of the beach is an important factor for sandy beach organisms. The effect of salinity and temperature suggest metabolic responses to local conditions and a role in small to mesoscale shifts in the range of these populations. © 2013 Baldanzi et al. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

First, we survey how people living in municipalities {{in the vicinity of the}} power plant perceive impacts on their personal quality of life. Second, we explore the effects of the power plant on regional development by analysing long-term statistical data about the unemployment rate, the share of workers in the energy sector and overall job opportunities in the respective municipalities. The results indicate that the power plant has had significant positive impacts on surrounding communities both as perceived by residents and as evidenced by the statistical data. The level of impacts is, however, significantly influenced by the spatial and social distances of communities and individuals from the power plant. The perception of positive impacts correlates with geographical proximity to the power plant, while the <b>hypothetical</b> <b>distance</b> where positive effects on the quality of life are no longer perceived was estimated at about 15 km.

To explain the pattern of specialization, I present a multi-country, perfectly-competitive Ricardian model that extends Eaton and Kortum (2002) to predict industry trade flows. In this framework, comparative advantage is determined by the interaction of country and industry characteristics, with countries specializing in industries whose specific production needs they are best able to meet with their factor endowments, institutional environment, and technological strengths. I estimate the model parameters using a large dataset of bilateral trade flows, comprising 82 countries and 20 manufacturing industries. I present results from a baseline OLS approach, and a simulated method of moments (SMM) procedure that takes into account the prevalence of zero trade flows in the data. The SMM estimates imply large average welfare gains from a <b>hypothetical</b> reduction in <b>distance</b> barriers, with developing countries benefiting substantially more than the OECD.

40|$|International audienceUnderstanding {{the drivers}} of habitat {{distribution}} patterns and assessing habitat connectivity are crucial for conservation. Habitat fragmentation {{is considered a}} major cause of biodiversity loss. It results in interruption of network between habitat patches and subsequent difficulty for gene flow between populations. Maintenance of landscape connectivity can promote populations move between habitat patches, which is essential to biological dispersal and gene flow in mosaic landscapes. In Yunnan, agriculture encroachment upon high altitude forest {{is one of the major}} threats to black and white snub-nosed monkey (Rhinopithecus bieti) habitats. In this study, we used maximum entropy distribution modeling (MaxEnt) to identify the climatic and topographic factors driving the distribution of the habitat type of the snub-nosed monkey. We also analyzed potential habitat connectivity between the groups reported in Yunnan, using genetic, least-cost path and Euclidean distance. We show that genetic distance is better explained by human disturbance and land-cover least-cost paths than by Euclidian distance. Furthermore, we used graph theory and least-cost distance to model the ecological network of the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey and to evaluate the connectivity improvement provided by potential measures of reforestation of agricultural lands. This approach was also used to assess the impact of highway development (including tunnels deviating traffic from the mountain roads) on the network connectivity. We show that potential habitat area will be reduced by 15 % in total but increases mainly in the north of the distribution range at high altitude (due to tunnels) and decreases at lower altitude (due to habitat fragmentation). Other scenarios were also explored: on the landscape scale, the scenario consisting to reforest with optimal habitat for monkeys provides the biggest increase in connectivity, of course. On patch scale, a patch addition algorithm was applied on 1482 cropland patches to identify the 10 that most increase connectivity at different threshold of (<b>hypothetical)</b> dispersal <b>distances.</b> Graph methods can help modeling connectivity on different scales for species whose habitats are fragmented and thus help planning habitat restoration and conservation measures...|$|R

The range of priors produced in this way can accommodate {{a wide variety of}} nonlinear time series models, including those with regime-switching and structural breaks.

40|$|Purpose – The {{field of}} service {{research}} has devoted consider able {{attention to the}} customer's role as value creator, {{but there is a}} lack of research on understanding customers' psychological processes in value creation. This paper highlights the importance of psychological distance in value-creation processes. Psychological distance is the customer's perceived distance from service interactions in terms of spatial distance, temporal distance social distance and <b>hypothetical</b> <b>distance.</b> Critically, psychological distance influences cognitive processes and can influence how customers think and feel about the service interaction. An appreciation of psychological distance within service contexts can help managers to tailor the interaction in order to facilitate value creation. Methodology/approach – In this conceptual paper, we build on psychology research and service research to develop seven propositions that explore how psychological distance can operate within service interactions and how this might influence value creation. Findings – We divide the propositions into three sections. The first concerns how perceived psychological distance from the service interaction can act as a barrier to entering a service interaction. In particular, we consider the influence of social distance and spatial distance within the context of service interactions. The second section examines how psychological distance to the expected point of service use can influence how customers construe the service and the value creation. The third aspect addresses customer-specific characteristics that can impact on value creation by influencing perceived psychological distance toward the service...|$|E
40|$|Using {{pairs of}} {{images from the}} Chandra High-Resolution Camera we examine the proper motion of the central compact object (CCO) 1 E 1207. 4 - 5209 in the {{supernova}} remnant (SNR) PKS 1209 - 51 / 52, and the unusual pulsar Calvera that is possibly a CCO descendant. For 1 E 1207. 4 - 5209, an insignificant proper motion of 15 +/- 7 mas/yr is measured, corresponding to a corrected tangential velocity of < 180 km/s at the distance of 2 kpc. This proves that the previously noted large offset of the pulsar from the apparent geometric center of the SNR is not due to high proper motion; evidently the symmetry of the remnant does not indicate its center of expansion. Calvera has a marginally significant proper motion of 69 +/- 26 mas/yr, corresponding to 86 +/- 33 km/s for a <b>hypothetical</b> <b>distance</b> of 0. 3 kpc. Notably, its vector is away from the Galactic plane, although its high Galactic latitude of b = + 37 deg may be more a consequence of its proximity than its velocity. We also provide updated timing solutions for each pulsar. Spanning 14. 5 yr, the ephemeris of 1 E 1207. 4 - 5209 has a small and steady frequency derivative that, because of the negligible proper motion, requires no kinematic correction. The derived surface dipole magnetic field strength of 1 E 1207. 4 - 5209 thus remains B_s = 9. 8 e 10 G. Calvera has B_s = 4. 4 e 11 G, intermediate between those of ordinary young pulsars and CCOs, suggesting {{that it may be}} on a trajectory of field growth that could account for the absence of descendants in the neighborhood of CCOs in the P-Pdot diagram.

40|$|Prior to {{this study}} it was {{discovered}} that MsrB 1 from Mus musculus expressed in Escherichia Coli binds cobalt(II) (hereafter cobalt) in cobalt-supplemented growth media, and it had further been demonstrated that the His-tag was not responsible for this metal uptake. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of cobalt on the growth of E. Coli in culture, characterize the metal-uptake and metal-binding site of cobalt-substituted MsrB 1 by UV-visible spectroscopy and to gain structural information about the protein by high resolution NMR spectroscopy. The effects of cobalt on growth of E. Coli were studied by growing cultures in Lysogeny broth (LB) and minimal (M 9) -media supplemented with different concentrations of cobaltdichloride (CoCl 2) and monitoring culture growth by optical density (OD) measurements. Growth rates were found to decrease with increasing concentrations of CoCl 2. To study the cobalt-uptake of MsrB 1, the protein was recombinantly expressed in E. Coli in different cobalt-supplemented growth media, and the purified protein analyzed by UV-vis spectroscopy. Cobalt-uptake was demonstrated in all cases by characteristic absorption peaks owing to the cobalt-ligand complex, and the wavelengths of these peaks matched those of a tetrahedral four-coordinated cobalt-Cys complex. It was argued that these four Cys residues should be the same that constitute the zinc(II) -binding site of MsrB 1, indicating that cobalt simply replaces zinc as a structural metal ion in cobalt-substituted MsrB 1 (Co-MsrB 1). It was argued that the intracellular concentration of cobalt in E. Coli should be significantly higher than zinc, and that this together with similar ionic radii for cobalt and zinc leads to the formation of Co-MsrB 1. MsrB 1 expressed in nickel(II) -supplemented LB did not lead to formation of Ni-MsrB 1, which was argued to result from nickel not being released directly into the cytosol in E. Coli. Co-MsrB 1 was produced by zinc-starvation of E. Coli followed by expressing the protein in zinc-free minimal medium supplemented with CoCl 2. To investigate if pH-titratable groups could be detected, the protein was dialyzed against buffers with pH 4. 9 - 11. 5 and the molar extinction coefficient was found from UV-vis absorption spectra in the different pH. Two titration curves were observed, but assignment of the titrations to specific residues could not be made. Further, Co- and Zn-MsrB 1 was dialyzed against buffers with metal chelating agents to remove the metal ions from the two proteins. Cobalt was successfully removed at pH 5. 0 and 5. 5, while removal of zinc from Zn-MsrB 1 was not detected, demonstrating that zinc is more tightly bound to the Cys-ligands than cobalt. To study the ratio of formation of Co-MsrB 1 and the native zinc-form Zn-MsrB 1 in CoCl 2 -supplemented growth media, the molar extinction coefficient of Co-MsrB 1 was determined, and the concentration of Co-MsrB 1 in purified protein samples from protein expression in different growth media was determined. The Co-MsrB 1 :Zn-MsrB 1 ratio was found to be 0. 2 in M 9 medium supplemented with 10 &# 181;M CoCl 2, 0. 1 in LB supplemented with 50 &# 181;M CoCl 2 and 0. 03 in LB supplemented with 10 &# 181;M CoCl 2. From 2 D- and 3 D-NMR experiments on 13 C- and 15 N-enriched Co-MsrB 1, a 70 % backbone assignment and 50 % side chain-assignment was accomplished using Computer Aided Resonance Assignment (CARA). The four structural Cys-residues of the native protein was not found, while the other three Cys-residues of MsrB 1 were assigned, confirming that the same Cys-residues are responsible for coordination of cobalt and zinc in MsrB 1. Many strongly shifted signals were observed in 1 D 1 H spectra of Co-MsrB 1, some as far upfield as 350 ppm and downfield as - 80 ppm, and it was argued that most of the unassigned residues should be found outside the spectral width of the 2 D and 3 D-NMR spectra. To gain further structural information about Co-MsrB 1, pseudocontact shifts (PCSs) were determined for the assigned HN-atoms of Co-MsrB 1 by using the published chemical shifts of for Zn-MsrB 1. The PCSs were analyzed by AnisoFit using three conformers and the mean conformer of the published Zn-MsrB 1 structure, and the best correlations between observed and calculated PCSs were found for conformer 3. The PCSs were plotted against their <b>hypothetical</b> <b>distance</b> to cobalt using the structure of Zn-MsrB 1, and a very good PCS-distance proportionality was found, indicating that Co-MsrB 1 and Zn-MsrB 1 have the same overall fold and structure. The AnisoFit calculations and PCSs of the N-terminus suggested that the N-terminus spends significant time in the proximity of the metal-binding site, and it was argued that this proximity ensures high catalytic efficiency due to the short distance between the catalytic and resolving Cys-residues. </p...|$|E
40|$|Many of the {{greatest}} problems of communicating about concepts, and, therefore, practice in distance education arise from our use of crude <b>hypothetical</b> constructs-terms like <b>distance,</b> independence, and interaction, which are used in very imprecise and general ways, each having acquired a multiplicity of meanings. Most seriously, the same terms are commonly used at both generic and more specific levels. For example, the generic concept "independence " is frequently confused with its species, independence of learners from instructors {{in space and time}} and independence of learners to control their means of study. These are further confused with the many subspecies of each type of independence. The same could be said of the concept and term "distance " itself, which is commonly used in the most general sense to describe education characterized by separation between learner and instructor, but by too few users in the more technical and specific meanings as discussed, for example, by Saba (1988), Keegan (1988), Shale (1988), or Moore (1984). Interaction is another important term that carries so many meanings as to be almost useless unless specific submeanings can be defined and generally agreed upon.

40|$|Abstract Background Chagas {{disease is}} a major public health concern in Latin America and it is {{transmitted}} by insects of the subfamily Triatominae, including Rhodnius spp. Since palm trees are ubiquitous in Colombia and a habitat for Rhodnius spp., the presence of palms near villages could increase contact rates between vectors and humans. Therefore, knowing whether a relationship exists between the proximity of palms to villages and the abundance and distribution of vectors therein, may be critical for Chagas disease prevention programs. Adapting a mathematical model for R. prolixus population dynamics in a small village, we model the implications of changing distances between palms and dwellings, {{to the risk of}} Chagas disease infection. Methods We implemented a mathematical model that reflects R. prolixus population dynamics in a small village located in the department of Casanare (Colombia) to study the role of palm-house proximity. We varied the distance between palms and houses by monitoring the network global efficiency metric. We constructed 1, 000 <b>hypothetical</b> villages varying <b>distances</b> and each one was run 100 times.

We describe HEMS primary scene responses {{with respect to the}} time taken, the distances travelled relative to the closest designated trauma hospital and the receiving hospital; as well as the clinical characteristics of patients attended. Methods Clinical service data were retrospectively obtained from three HEMS in New South Wales between July 2008 and June 2009. All available primary scene response data were extracted and examined. Geographic Information System (GIS) based network analysis was used to estimate <b>hypothetical</b> ground transport <b>distances</b> from the locality of each primary scene response to firstly the closest designated trauma hospital and secondly the receiving hospital. Predictors of bypassing the closest designated trauma hospital were analysed using logistic regression. Results Analyses included 596 primary missions. Overall the HEMS had a median return trip time of 94 min including a median of 9 min for activation, 34 min travelling to the scene, 30 min on-scene and 25 min transporting patients to the receiving hospital. 72 % of missions were within 100 km of the receiving hospital and 87 % of missions were in areas classified as ‘major cities’ or ‘inner regional’. The majority of incidents attended by HEMS were trauma-related, with road trauma the predominant cause (44 %). The majority of trauma patients (81 %) had normal physiology at HEMS arrival (RTS = 7. 84). We found 62 % of missions bypassed the closest designated trauma hospital. Multivariate predictors of bypass included: age; presence of spinal or burns trauma; the level of the closest designated trauma hospital; the transporting HEMS. Conclusion Our results document the large distances travelled by HEMS in NSW, especially in rural areas. The high proportion of HEMS missions that bypass the closest designated trauma hospital is a seldom mentioned benefit of HEMS transport. These results along with the characteristics of patients attended and the time HEMS take to complete primary scene responses are useful in understanding the benefit HEMS provides and the services it replaces. </p...|$|R

The majority of trauma patients (81 %) had normal physiology at HEMS arrival (RTS = 7. 84). We found 62 % of missions bypassed the closest designated trauma hospital. Multivariate predictors of bypass included: age; presence of spinal or burns trauma; the level of the closest designated trauma hospital; the transporting HEMS. Conclusion: Our results document the large distances travelled by HEMS in NSW, especially in rural areas. The high proportion of HEMS missions that bypass the closest designated trauma hospital is a seldom mentioned benefit of HEMS transport. These results along with the characteristics of patients attended and the time HEMS take to complete primary scene responses are useful in understanding the benefit HEMS provides and the services it replaces. © 2012 Taylor et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R
