2500|$|Paul {{seems to}} have refused [...] "to be tied down to {{particular}} patterns of behavior and practice." [...] He does not engage in a dispute with those Corinthians who apparently feel quite free to eat anything offered to idols, never appealing or even mentioning the <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>council.</b> He rather attempts to persuade them by appealing to the care they should have for other believers who might not feel so free.|$|E
2500|$|Because of Paul's exhortations {{throughout}} Galatians {{about freedom}} [...] "in Christ", Galatians {{has been called}} “the Magna Carta of the Reformation” and Luther’s “Katie von Bora.” It is the book on which the Protestant Reformation was founded. F.F. Bruce writes {{that the purpose of}} this letter to the Galatian Christians was to refute the Judaizers’ false gospel—a gospel in which these Jewish Christians felt that circumcision was essential to salvation—and to remind the Galatians of the real basis of their salvation. It was the urgency of the situation which moved Paul to write even before the <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>Council</b> convened, for the churches of Galatia were at stake.|$|E

5000|$|Biblical {{scholars}} {{agree that}} Galatians {{is a true}} example of Paul's writing.

50|$|The {{description}} of the 'Apostolic Council' in , generally considered the same event described in , is considered by some scholars to be contradictory to the Galatians account. The historicity of Luke's account has been challenged, and was rejected completely by some scholars {{in the mid to}} late 20th century. However, more recent scholarship inclines towards treating the <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>Council</b> and its rulings as a historical event, though this is sometimes expressed with caution.|$|E

5000|$|Next is Peter's own arrest, his miraculous {{release from}} prison, and {{appearance}} {{at the house of}} Mary the mother of John, also called Mark (Acts 12). This is followed by Paul's eventual partnership with Barnabas in ministry to the Gentiles beginning with their 1st Missionary Journey (Acts 13-14). Then comes the <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>Council</b> meeting, called to debate whether or not male Gentiles who were converting as followers of Jesus were required to become circumcised (Acts 15).|$|E
5000|$|After {{they had}} {{returned}} to Antioch from the <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>council,</b> they spent some time there (15:35). Peter came and associated freely there with the Gentiles, eating with them, until criticized for this by some disciples of James, as against Mosaic law. Upon their remonstrances, Peter yielded apparently through fear of displeasing them, and refused to eat any longer with the Gentiles. Barnabas followed his example. Paul considered that they [...] "walked not uprightly according {{to the truth of}} the gospel" [...] and upbraided them before the whole church (Galatians 2:11-15).|$|E
50|$|The South Galatian view {{holds that}} Paul wrote Galatians before or {{shortly after the}} First <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>Council,</b> {{probably}} {{on his way to}} it, and that it was written to churches he had presumably planted during either his time in Tarsus (he would have traveled a short distance, since Tarsus is in Cilicia) after his first visit to Jerusalem as a Christian, or during his first missionary journey, when he traveled throughout southern Galatia. If it was written to the believers in South Galatia, it would likely have been written in 49.|$|E
