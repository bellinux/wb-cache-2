5|$|The {{respondents}} {{also noted}} that Gaudron made similar comments in the Stolen Generations case, which also considered non-judicial detention {{in the context of}} Aboriginal children who were forcibly removed from their parents' care. For this reason and others, they argued that the power to <b>detain</b> people for the purposes of criminal trial and punishment (as opposed to detention generally) was clearly a judicial function, but there is no general rule and other powers to <b>detain</b> may not offend Chapter III.|$|E

As Arya runs outside looking for her sword, a stable boy tries to <b>detain</b> her for the Queen, but she fatally stabs him before fleeing the castle.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the English Civil War in 1642 between the supporters of Charles I and Parliament, the castle was occupied by Captain Richard Swanley, a supporter of Parliament. In December 1648 it was briefly used to <b>detain</b> the King before his trial and execution. During the interregnum, it remained in use under the command of Colonel Thomas Eyre and was reinforced in 1650 to deal with the threat of a Royalist invasion.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to compare the {{criminal}} histories of juveniles who are incarcerated versus <b>detained</b> within the juvenile justice system. Specifically, this study compared youths with and without a special education diagnosis that were either <b>detained</b> or incarcerated on various delinquency variables. The variables that were examined were: ethnicity, age at first offense, number of referrals in criminal record, and level of most serious offense. It was hypothesized that there would be no significant associations between the incarcerated and <b>detained</b> youths on each of these variables when examining the observed frequencies. Additionally, it was hypothesized that there would be no significant associations between the special education and non-special education youths. In terms of ethnicity, there was a significant association between the special education and non-special education youths for the entire sample as well as the <b>detained</b> sample. There was a significant association found between the non-special education incarcerated and non-special education <b>detained</b> youths on the observed frequencies of age of first offense and between special education and non-special education youths in the incarcerated sample. When evaluating the total number of referrals, a significant association was found between the incarcerated and <b>detained</b> youths, incarcerated and <b>detained</b> non-special education youths, incarcerated and <b>detained</b> special education youths, and incarcerated and <b>detained</b> emotionally disturbed youths. There was also a significant association found between special education and non-special education youths in the <b>detained</b> sample as well as the incarcerated sample on the number of referrals. The analyses of the level of most serious offense revealed significant associations between the incarcerated and <b>detained</b> non-special education youths, incarcerated and <b>detained</b> special education youths, and incarcerated and <b>detained</b> emotionally disturbed youths. There were no significant associations found between the learning disabled incarcerated and learning disabled <b>detained</b> youths on any variables. The results highlight the many areas in which incarcerated youths and <b>detained</b> youths, as well as special education and non-special education youths, differ within the juvenile justice system. The implications of these findings, future areas for research, and the study's limitations are discussed...|$|R
5|$|A seizure {{does not}} occur just because the {{government}} questions an individual in a public place. The exclusionary rule would not bar voluntary answers to such questions from being offered into evidence in a subsequent criminal prosecution. The person is not being seized if his freedom of movement is not restrained. The government may not <b>detain</b> an individual even momentarily without reasonable, objective grounds, with few exceptions. His refusal to listen or answer does not by itself furnish such grounds.|$|E

Upon Queen Elizabeth's request, Charles visited her and her daughter on 7February 1386. During the meeting, Blaise Forgách attacked the king, seriously injuring him on the head.

5|$|Iraqi–British {{relations}} {{entered a}} short cooling-down period {{during and after}} the crisis. The Iraqis were previously encouraged by the British to <b>detain</b> Patriarch Shimun in order to defuse tensions. The British were also wary of Iraqi military leaders and recommended Sidqi, a senior ethnic Kurdish general who was stationed in Mosul, be transferred to another region due to his open animosity towards the Assyrians. Later, they had to intervene to dissuade Faysal from personally leading a tribal force to punish the Assyrians.|$|E

It briefly served as a recruitment centre for the British Foreign Legion during the Crimean War, and was then sold to the British for use as a military prison. In 1907 the land was granted to the Canadian government, which used it to <b>detain</b> German and Austro-Hungarian nationals during the First World War. During the Second World War, prisoners were sent to McNabs Island instead, and ammunition depots were kept on Melville Island.|$|E

5|$|Psychiatry {{possesses}} {{an inherent}} capacity for abuse that {{is greater than}} {{in other areas of}} medicine. The diagnosis of mental disease can give the state license to <b>detain</b> persons against their will and insist upon therapy both {{in the interest of the}} detainee and in the broader interests of society. In addition, receiving a psychiatric diagnosis can in itself be regarded as oppressive. In a monolithic state, psychiatry can be used to bypass standard legal procedures for establishing guilt or innocence and allow political incarceration without the ordinary odium attaching to such political trials.|$|E

The plan threatened a landing near Sete (chosen for its distance from the Dragoon landing site) by the US Seventh Army, consisting of fictional divisions, and some French units. Vendetta was supported by a diplomatic deception, Operation Royal Flush, which requested support from the Spanish government to allow injured soldiers to be evacuated following an invasion.|$|E
