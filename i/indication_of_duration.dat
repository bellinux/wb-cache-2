(Med), Faculty of Health Sciences,University of the Witwatersrand, 2011 Background: Many factors {{affect the}} {{prescribing}} of medication {{to patients with}} schizophrenia including variables that relate to physicians and may result in marked variance {{in the choice of}} drugs, dosages, drug combinations, route of administration and the use of antipsychotic, anticholinergic, sedative and other adjuvant drugs. Clinical practice guidelines were developed to address this variance and for other reasons, including the management of side-effects, drug innovation, rising costs, information overload, changes in treatment goals and the management of medication non-adherence. There are advantages and disadvantages to using clinical practice guidelines including those pertaining to context and cultural norms, but they remain the best method of assessing prescribing quality. Many guidelines are {{based on the results of}} randomised clinical trials (with a single drug) or are the consensus of experts in the field. Despite the development and publication of these guidelines over the past two decades, they are frequently not adhered to resulting in much variance in treatment. Aims and objectives: The aim of the study was to determine to what extent the prescribing of psychotropic drugs in the treatment of schizophrenia was consistent with the most recent version of each of five guidelines that originate outside South Africa (two from the United States and one each from Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia and New Zealand); and one that was developed locally. Methodology: A retrospective, cross-sectional prescription chart review with data sampling at three time points (on hospital admission, at fourteen days thereafter and on hospital discharge) was undertaken. A sample population was drawn over a three year period during which the patients’ physician had access to the same drug formulary. Seventy patients met the study selection criteria in terms of age, diagnosis and receipt of antipsychotic medication during hospital stay and on discharge. Seventy patients met the study selection criteria, and their prescriptions for psychotropic medication (exclusively) were examined for a number of parameters including: drug class, drug name, dose, route of administration and whether the medication was to be administered routinely or ‘as needed’. Findings and discussion: As compared with the recommendations made in some or all of the guidelines, first generation antipsychotic agents were over-prescribed especially early on in the patients’ hospital stay, whereas second generation antipsychotics were under-prescribed. The profile changed after fourteen days and on discharge there were more patients on second generation drugs than on the older drugs. More patients were discharged on depot antipsychotic treatment than were admitted which is considered a favourable finding, however, many patients receiving the depot form continued to be prescribed the oral drug on a routine basis and for an indefinite period, resulting in antipsychotic polypharmacy. Anticholinergic drugs were prescribed as prophylaxis for the extra-pyramidal side-effects of the first generation antipsychotic drugs and more than a quarter of the sample received these drugs on discharge, after which they were to be taken routinely and indefinitely. A similar finding was made with the use of benzodiazepine sedatives, where nearly a quarter of patients received these drugs on discharge - again to be taken routinely and for an unspecified period. Sodium valproate was given increasingly to many patients in the sample and was prescribed to over a quarter of those upon discharge, without an <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>duration.</b> Limitations: The study was retrospective in design, without the benefit of the patients’ clinical histories and treatment progress, and the findings were compared with guidelines whose age spanned more than a decade and some of which had become redundant. Conclusions: The study demonstrated some prescribing habits that were not in accord with the guidelines used for comparison in the study. The extent of the disagreement reveals the need for a prospective pilot study that will include the patients’ clinical progress in the study design which will provide greater insight into why specific medication parameters were chosen by the physician for the individual patient. If the findings justify it, then a programme promoting better adherence to the most current guidelines should be commenced...|$|E

40|$|Background:¦Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) is a {{congenital}} malformation of the enteric nervous system due to the¦arrest of migration of neural crest cells {{to form the}} myenteric and submucosal plexuses. It leads to an anganglionic intestinal segment, which is permanently contracted causing intestinal obstruction. Its incidence is approximately 1 / 5000 birth, and males are more frequently affected with a male/female ratio of 4 / 1. The diagnosis is in most cases made within {{the first year of}} life. The rectal biopsy of the mucosa and sub-mucosa is the diagnostic gold standard. ¦Purpose:¦The aim {{of this study was to}} compare two surgical approaches for HSCR, the Duhamel technique and the transanal endorectal pull-through (TEPT) in term <b>of</b> <b>indications,</b> <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> surgery, <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> hospital stay, postoperative treatment, complications, frequency of enterocolitis and functional outcomes. ¦Methods:¦Fifty-nine patients were treated for HSCR by one of the two methods in our department of pediatric¦surgery between 1994 and 2010. These patients were separated into two groups (I: Duhamel, II: TEPT), which were compared on the basis of medical records. Statistics were made to compare the two groups (ANOVA test). The first group includes 43 patients and the second 16 patients. It is noteworthy that twenty-four patients (about 41 % of all¦patients) were referred from abroad (Western Africa). Continence was evaluated with the Krickenbeck's score. ¦Results:¦Statistically, this study showed that operation duration, hospital stay, postoperative fasting and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> postoperative antibiotics were significantly shorter (p value < 0. 05) in group II (TEPT). But age at operation and length of aganglionic segment showed no significant difference between the two groups. The continence follow-up showed generally good results (Krickenbeck's scores 1; 2. 1; 3. 1) in both groups with a slight tendency to constipation in group I and soiling in group II. ¦Conclusion:¦We found two indications for the Duhamel method that are being referred from a country without¦careful postoperative surveillance and/or having a previous colostomy. Even if the Duhamel technique tends to be replaced by the TEPT, it remains the best operative approach for some selected patients. TEPT has also proved some advantages but must be followed carefully because, among other points, of the postoperative dilatations. Our postoperative standards, like digital rectal examination and anal dilatations seem to reduce the occurrence of complications like rectal spur and anal/anastomosis stenosis, respectively in the Duhamel method and the TEPT technique...|$|R

The <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> keratoplasty, <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> preservation of the GPC, and its outcome were analyzed. Descriptive statistics were applied. Results: Out of the 222 penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) performed over the study period, the GPC was used in 34 patients (males = 31, 91. 2 %) aged 15 – 74 years. Therapeutic keratoplasty was performed in all cases in this cohort except one in which tectonic keratoplasty was done. The primary <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> PKP (91. 2 %) was infectious keratitis. Of these, 20 (64. 5 %) patients presented with perforated corneal ulcers. Post-PKP, ocular anatomy was preserved in 91. 2 %, and visual acuity of perception of light positive and accurate projection of rays in all the quadrants was obtained in 76. 5 % cases.

40|$|The P 300 is a {{positive}} wave which arises when an attended stimulus is detected. Its parameters depend {{on a number of}} variables, in particular the subject's mental state, the task that has to be accomplished, the significance of the stimulus, and the degree of attention. It can be recorded with accuracy, and the different stages of information processing can therefore be analyzed. The P 300 wave shows the modifications in neuronal activity which take place during the cognitive process: P 300 latency provides an indirect <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the processes involved in stimulus discrimination while its amplitude, which is influenced by a number of variables, provides an index of the intensity of the energetic activation or arousal involved. The P 300 wave consists of several components which reflect distinct information-processing events (P 3 a, P 3 b, P 3 e, P-SR, P-CR). According to the theoretical models, it is hypothesized that P 300 could either represent the adaptation of the working memory to further environmental input ('context updating'), or indicate a closing process ('context closure') in information processing. As regards the physiological aspect of P 300 and its association with cortical networks, various studies have suggested that several cortical generators of P 300 may co-exist: the medial temporal lobe, the temporo-parietal junction, and the medial and lateral frontal lobe. Psychopharmacological studies have shown that different neurotransmitter systems are involved in the generation and modulation of P 300, namely the cholinergic, noradrenergic, dopaminergic, serotoninergic and gabaergic systems. It appears that the noradrenergic agonists increase the amplitude of P 300, dopaminergic agonists may have a biphasic effect (increase/reduction), while cholinergic antagonists and gabaergic agonists reduce P 300 amplitude and prolong its latency.

Materials and Methods: Every day of the study, a computer program was used to compile a list of patients' bedside records. On a specific day, the bedside charts of selected patients were reviewed to determine whether: (1) a justification for antibiotic prescription was recorded; (2) <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> antibiotic therapy had been defined; (3) suitable cultures had been obtained; and (4) treatment was appropriate for the infection to be treated. For 6 months, charts were evaluated 3 days per week. Results: Of 750 bedside charts 500 (67 %) were selected for review. Of the 500 patients, 175 (35 %) did not receive antibiotics. The abuses or misuses of antibiotics most frequently observed among the 325 treated patients were no record of justification for the antibiotic prescribed (130325, 40 %); no appropriate blood or fluid samples obtained for culture (45325, 14 %); no subsequent control cultures or cultures obtained before modifying therapy (80175, 46 %); no <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> a planned <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> therapy (180325, 55 %); and improper dosage prescribed in relation to weight (25325, 8 %).

40|$|The Sharpsburg, Kentucky, {{earthquake}} was {{the second}} largest earthquake to {{have occurred in the}} United States, east of the Continental Divide, in the past 20 yr, having a seismic moment of 4. 1 x 1023 dyne-cm. A surface-wave focal mechanism study defines a nodal plane striking N 30 °E, dipping 50 °SE, and a nearly vertical nodal plane striking N 60 °W. P-wave first motion data indicate right-lateral motion on the nodal plane striking N 30 °E, with the pressure axes oriented east-west. These angles can be varied by _ _ 10 ° without affecting the fit to the surface-wave data. The surface-wave solution is reinforced by a modeling of long-period seismograms at regional distances. The P, pP, and sP polarities and amplitudes from the short-period vertical component array stack at NORSAR are used together with six unambiguous short-period P-wave first motions recorded in North America to test whether it is possible to constrain focal mechanism solutions with such data. These solutions are compatible with the surface-wave solution. Waveform modeling of the NORSAR data suggests a source pulse <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> 1. 0 sec and constrains the depth to 12. 0 km. To match mb estimates from NORSAR and Canadian stations, t *, for teleseismic P, must be 0. 7 and 0. 5, respectively, when the synthetics are scaled using the surface-wave seismic moment. In spite of extensive coverage of the epicentral zone, fewer than 70 after-shocks were recorded. The largest aftershock had an mbLg = 2. 2. Aftershock locations suggest that the nodal plane striking N 30 °E is the fault plane. An aftershock area of 30 to 50 km 2 implies a stress drop of 2. 8 to 6 bars and a dislocation of 2. 0 to 3. 4 cm. Because of the variety of studies performed, this earthquake is presently the best-studied eastern North American seismic event with well-constrained esti-mates of focal depth, focal mechanism and seismic moment, and <b>indications</b> <b>of</b> the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the source time function and upper mantle P-wave t*...|$|R

Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Population-based 3 -city studyParticipants: 6 600 participants aged 65 years and over included between 1999 and 2001 and followed after 2, 4 and 7 years. Measurements: Benzodiazepine users were separated into hypnotic, short-acting anxiolytic and long-acting anxiolytic users and compared with non users. Three outcomes were examined assessing restrictions in mobility, instrumental {{activities of daily}} living (IADL) and social participation. Results: In multivariate simple or mixed logistic models adjusted for socio-demographic variables, impairments and comorbidity and for anxiety, insomnia and depression, hypnotic benzodiazepines were moderately associated with mobility limitation prevalence and IADL limitation incidence. Short-acting and long-acting anxiolytics were associated with IADL limitation prevalence and with mobility limitation prevalence and incidence and long-acting anxiolytics were also associated with IADL limitations incidence. Chronic benzodiazepines users were at a marked risk of developing restrictions for the three outcomes (odds ratio 1. 71 (95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 23 - 2. 39) for mobility, 1. 54 [95 %CI, 1. 14 - 2. 10] for IADL and 1. 74 [95 %CI, 1. 23 - 2. 47] for participation limitations). Conclusions: Benzodiazepine users are at increased risk of activity limitations regardless <b>of</b> the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> action or <b>indication.</b> Chronic use <b>of</b> benzodiazepines should be avoided in order to extend disability-free survival...|$|R
40|$|Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) is a rare, {{benign and}} locally {{invasive}} tumor. Massive bleeding because of vascularity of tumor and postoperative recurrence are potential problems of management.

40|$|Various {{models have}} been {{developed}} for the prediction of pregnancy after in vitro fertilization (IVF). These models differ from one another in the predictors they include. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the most relevant predictors for success in IVF. We systematically searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies evaluating IVF/ICSI outcome. Studies were included if they reported an unconditional odds ratio (OR) or whenever one could be calculated for {{one or more of the}} following factors: age, type <b>of</b> infertility, <b>indication,</b> <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> infertility, basal FSH, number of oocytes, fertilization method, number of embryos transferred and embryo quality. Fourteen studies were identified. A summary OR could be calculated for five factors. We found negative associations between pregnancy and female age [OR: 0. 95, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 94 - 0. 96], <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> subfertility (OR: 0. 99, 95 % CI: 0. 98 - 1. 00) and basal FSH (OR: 0. 94, 95 % CI: 0. 88 - 1. 00). We found a positive association with number of oocytes (OR 1. 04, 95 % CI: 1. 02 - 1. 07). Better embryo quality was associated with higher pregnancy chances. No significant association was found for the type of infertility and fertilization method. A summary OR for IVF <b>indication</b> and number <b>of</b> embryos transferred could not be calculated, because studies reporting on these used different reference categories. Female age, <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> subfertility, bFSH and number of oocytes, all reflecting ovarian function, are predictors of pregnancy after IVF. Better quality studies are necessary, especially studies that focus on embryo factors that are predictive of success in IV...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{method of}} {{percutaneous}} endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement {{can be divided}} into the pull and introducer techniques. We compared short-term complications and prognosis between patients who underwent the pull technique and two other types of introducer techniques, the trocar introducer technique and T-fastener gastro-pexy technique. Methods: Twenty-six patients who underwent PEG were enrolled in this study. We retrospectively investigated the age, sex, body weight, weight-for-age Z-score, underlying diseases, PEG <b>indications,</b> complications, <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> NPO (nil per os), pain control frequency, and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> antibiotic therapy. The patients were classified into three groups according to the PEG technique. The occurrence of complications was monitored for 10 weeks after the procedure. Results: The age, sex, body weight, and weight-for-age Z-score were not significantly between the three groups. Most patients had cerebral palsy and seizure disorders. Dysphagia was the most common indication for PEG. Major complications occurred in 5 (50 %), 4 (66. 7 %), and 0 (0 %) patients in group I, II, and III, respectively (p= 0. 005). Further, peristomal infection requiring systemic antibiotic therapy occurred in 2 (20 %), 3 (50 %), and 0 (0 %) patients in group I, II, and III, respectively (p= 0. 04). There {{was no significant difference between}} the groups with respect to minor complications, <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> NPO, pain control frequency, and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> antibiotic therapy...|$|R
30|$|This retrospective, {{observational}} {{analysis was}} conducted at a 14 -bed intensive care unit (ICU) {{of the department of}} Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, Charité University Medicine Berlin, a national referral center for treatment of ARDS and part of the German ARDS network ([URL] After written consent from the hospital ethics commission (EA 2 / 172 / 17), all adult patients admitted for ARDS according to the Berlin definition [4] between January 2007 and December 2014 entered the study. Excluded were patients aged <[*] 18  years, those that were re-admitted after hospital discharge and patients who died within the first 24  h after ICU admission. Also excluded were patients for whom NRBC values were not available for any reason.
