In Study 1, participants read a male/female character description that was manipulated according to gender and sexual stereotypes in order to be masculine, feminine or neutral. Next, participants were asked to indicate their preference for 3 voice actors/actresses who sounded heterosexual, gay/lesbian or ambivalent. Study 2 tested the interplay between a character’s description and the voice of the English-speaking (gay/lesbian- vs. heterosexual-sounding) actor/actress who played the role in the original TV series on dubbing preferences. The results of both studies showed that a character's description affected dubbing preferences. Participants preferred the gay/lesbian-sounding voice actor/actress to the counter-stereotypical character (i. e., a <b>feminine</b> <b>man</b> or a masculine woman) and the heterosexual -sounding voice actor/actress to the stereotypical character.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{research}} how concerned QMU male graduates are about their appearance, especially in terms of their facial skin when they enter the highly competitive job market where first impressions are crucial. The male grooming industry is seeing enormous profits of over $ 20 billion (Kline 2008) and is still growing (Kline 2012). The economic climate has caused extremely high competition for jobs (Ziegler 2009). This exaggerates the importance of a good first impression (Himmel 2008) and a bigger market for the male grooming industry. The new trend within this market is targeting of younger males (Rome 2006) and not just baby boomers (Antoinette 2005). A phenomenological study (Parry 2003) has been used with mixed methods (Cameron 2011). The qualitative methods have been interviews and focus groups that will grasp the complexity (Woodside 2010) of the research and explore opinions and experiences of male grooming products (Rowley 2012). The quantitative method has been questionnaires to give statistical analysis (Hughes 2003). The research will be done over a four week period, making it a cross sectional study (Hair et al 2011). The participants will be QMU students in their last year who have been brought up in the UK and are willing to participate, making it a non probability sample (Alder and Clark 2011). Ethical consideration has been made (Coldwell and Herbst 2004) and ethical approval was granted for this study on the 14 th January 2013.

40|$|In {{this essay}} I examine how {{identity}} is created in William S. Burroughs two early novels Junky andQueer. The theoretic starting points are Lacans psychoanlytic concepts ”ideal ego”, ”egoideal” and the ”superego” and also queertheory as presented by Tiina Rosenberg {{in her book}} Queerfeministisk agenda. The examination contains an analysis of how Burroughs creates identity in both Junky and Queer with main focus on the second novel. I {{look at how the}} desire in the maincharacter Lee is described and what the desire is aimed at. In Junky Lee has a need for drugs and in Queer the desire is aimed at sexual contact with other men. I examine how the desire switches between the novels and how it affects his identity. There is a difference in how Lee sees himself and how the people around him sees him. He sees himself as the masculine homosexual man but the society has antoher view of how homosexual men should act and look like, that is the effiminate man. There is a conflict between Lees ideal ego and the ego-ideal wich has great impact on how his identity is formed. There is a gap between his interpretation of himself and how other sees him wich creates a disintegration in his identity. This essay tries to describe how this disintegration in Lees identity appears and how he handles it. Burroughs is wellknown for his so called ”routines”. These are crazy and imaginative monologues created by the maincharacter Lee. In this essay I present these routines as a way for Lee to take back control of his own identity, he uses them as a way to convince his surroundings that he is the masculine homosexual guy with control not the <b>feminine</b> <b>man</b> that other people sees him as. I also examine how the maincharacter Lee reflects Burroughs as his ideal ego. Ginsbergs have said that Queer is ”Burroughs heart laid bare” and that is a central point throughout my essay...|$|E

40|$|Abstract]: This {{dissertation}} explored how {{gender identity}} is constructed in elite sport. I argued that sport {{is a unique}} socio-cultural context where gender category membership, may be enacted both the same and differently than in other contexts. Historically, most gender stereotyping, gender trait, and gender identity research in sport (e. g., Andre & Holland, 1995; Csizma, Wittig, & Schurr, 1988; Harris & Griffin, 1997) has employed researcher-generated constructions of masculinity and femininity, or non-sporting constructions of masculinity and femininity. By failing to define and construct gender from the participants' perspective, researchers have imposed their own preconceived cultural standards of gender upon participants (Doyle & Paludi, 1995). To generalise these preconceptions to other groups is {{to do so without}} consideration of cultural diversity and possible difference (Doyle & Paludi). Therefore, previous sport gender studies that have used these methodologies are tenuous as contemporary and future models upon which to base gender work. Further, gender identity research that has utilised a discursive psychological theoretical and methodological framework has produced findings that question the empirical validity of current models of gender in sport and exercise psychology (see Wetherell & Edley, 1999). These discursive results suggest that gender is a multifaceted, multidimensional, multifactorial, negotiated, dynamic, and variable concept (Wetherell & Edley, 1999). Therefore, two research questions were addressed by this dissertation: 1) How do participants perceive themselves in terms of gender-related characteristics?; and 2) How do elite sportswomen and sportsmen enact and negotiate membership of idiosyncratic, gender, and gender identity in sport categories? In order to address these research questions two self-report measures were utilised, the 24 -item Personal Attributes Questionnaire (PAQ) (Spence & Helmreich, 1978) and a semi-structured interview concerning identity prescription. Thirty-eight elite level coaches (19 women, 19 men) and 37 elite level athletes (19 women, 18 men) voluntarily participated in this study. The interview data were analysed using two divergent theoretical and analytical frameworks, an a-priori content analysis (imposition of the PAQ items on interview responses) and a discursive psychological framework. The results of the PAQ analysis suggest that sportswomen and sportsmen perceive themselves differently in relation to gender-related characteristics. Differences which did not reach statistical significance, were found between male and female responses on the PAQ Masculine (M), Feminine (F), and Masculine-Feminine (M-F) sub-scales. Statistically significant differences were found with reference to PAQ classification, with women more likely to be classified as Androgynous and men as Masculine. There were no statistically significant occupational differences on either PAQ sub-scale responding or PAQ classification. The above results call into question the underlying assumptions and theoretical foundations of the PAQ. The a-priori content analysis also revealed a number of contradictory findings with reference to the assumptions and foundations of the PAQ scale. For example, women were more likely to utilise the PAQ M item Self-confident to describe themselves as gendered individuals than men. Whereas men were more likely to use the PAQ F item Gentle than women in the same identity category. Further, Feminine classified people were more likely to use the PAQ M-F item Very Dominant when describing themselves as women/men in elite sport. Therefore, the PAQ and a priori results cast doubt on the empirical utility of two factor models of gender to understand gender as a complex and dynamic construct. The results suggest that elite sport might be a context where gender is distinctively enacted and constituted. In order to determine how gender identity is enacted and negotiated in competitive sport, the interview data were analysed using a discursive psychological approach. Discursive psychology focuses upon how representations are constructed within, and constitutive of, the social practices that are found in language. In this respect, gender is conceptualised as being negotiated within the local interactive context where culture, history, and social contexts are reflected within discursive practices. In Research Question Two, interest centred on the interpretative repertoires and reflexive positions that participants used to prescribe themselves as idiosyncratic, gendered, and gendered individuals in sport. Interpretative repertoires are recurrent, culturally familiar global discursive patterns that individuals use to make sense of themselves in conversations (Wetherell, 1998; Wetherell & Potter, 1988). Reflexive positions are offered as an alternative discursive notion to the social psychological concept of role (Davies & Harré, 1990). A person is not considered as an individual free agent, but rather as the subject of the interaction, where the individual takes up or is placed in various subject positions depending upon the discourse and the particular social context in which the individual interacts. Thus we make sense of ourselves, or position ourselves, within social interactions through the cultural and personal resources (interpretative repertoires) that are made available to us in our discourse. Overall, the results of the discursive analysis suggest that participants enacted something gender scholars would call Masculinity, Femininity, and Androgyny when prescribing themselves across the three identity categories. That is, participants used gendered, culturally familiar discursive patterns (interpretative repertoires) to make sense of themselves across identity categories. However, participants were also able to draw upon non gender-related discourses during this process. Thus, identity work was characterised by variability, inconsistency, and contradiction. Different interpretative repertoires and reflexive positions were used by participants both within and across identity categories. Therefore, the use of gender-related interpretative repertoires differed according to the identity that was being scripted up. Thus participants were able to be Masculine, Androgynous, and Feminine, and position themselves differently depending upon the identity that was being prescribed and the local interaction context. That is, participants used interpretative repertoires to talk one way, but walk another (e. g., Androgynous interpretative repertoire, Hegemonic Masculine reflexive position) that was specific to the social, historical, and cultural context, and the local interactional context. The above results call into question Spence and Helmreich’s (1978) postulation that there is one Masculine and one Feminine identity. Indeed the results are suggestive of many Masculinities and many Femininities. Participants also deployed specific discursive strategies that incorporated the action and epistemological orientation of their talk when constituting their identities. That is, they worked to increase the facticity of their talk and worked to align themselves with certain positions (e. g., Hegemonic Masculine man) and not others (<b>Feminine</b> <b>man)</b> through their discourse. Thus gendered talk carried with it gendered ideological practices that participants used to reproduce, reinforce, and challenge the current gender order. The above results, combined with the disparity between the PAQ results and the a-priori content analysis, suggest that earlier and current models of gender that conceptualise gender as a multifaceted, multidimensional, bi-directional but static concept are probably not representative of how people do gender in everyday talk. The results support extant theory that gender identities might exist rather than a single gender identity. Overall, the results of this dissertation -suggest that elite sportswomen and sportsmen enact and negotiate membership of identity categories that is specific to the local interactional context, as well as the cultural, social (i. e., sport), and historical context. I infer, therefore, that current static gender models in sport and exercise psychology may not fully capture the complexity of gender in everyday talk and that alternative ways of understanding gender in sport are needed...|$|E

For example, <b>feminine</b> gay <b>men</b> are often labeled [...] "fem," [...] "bitchy," [...] "pissy," [...] "sissy," [...] or [...] "queen" [...] (e.g., Christian, 2005; Clarkson, 2006; Payne,2007).

Thus, sissyphobia plays as the communication strategy for straight-acting gay men to justify and empower their masculinity. (p. 38).|$|R

Far fewer studies have investigated the effects of cues to the direction of others' social interest (i. e. gaze direction) on face preferences.

Moreover, unpartnered women's preferences for direct gaze from <b>feminine</b> <b>men</b> were stronger for long-term than short-term relationships, {{but there was no}} comparable effect for judgements of masculine men.

Besides, in general features were surveyed hand-lateral-preference, professional orientation and attention capability.

40|$|Masculinity and {{femininity}} {{have been shown}} to be related to sociosexuality (an individual 2 ̆ 7 s propensity to engage in uncommitted sexual relationships). Masculinity is associated with an unrestricted sociosexual orientation (i. e. tendency to engage in uncommitted sex), while femininity is associated with a restricted sociosexual orientation (i. e. tendency not to engage in uncommitted sex). These two traits are shown to influence human mate preferences. This study used several questionnaire measures (including gender identity, sociosexuality, mate preferences, and personality), revealed preferences, and a speed-dating protocol to investigate the dynamic relationship between gender identity and sociosexuality, and their individual and interactive influences on human mate preferences. This study also assessed an array of other evolutionary hypotheses regarding attractiveness and human mating behaviour. Data was collected from 119 participants, predominately undergraduate students, (55 males, 64 female) with a mean age of 18. 58 years. There were two competing primary hypotheses. The first predicted that all individuals would tend to prefer mates who are similar to themselves in sociosexuality and masculinity/femininity, given their shared interest in uncommitted sexual relationships. The second hypothesis opposed the first, and predicts that <b>feminine</b> <b>men</b> would prefer masculine women, and masculine women would prefer <b>feminine</b> <b>men.</b> Results for female participants supported the second hypothesis, and the accompanying theory that a sexatypical gender identity confers reproductive fitness in heterosexuals.
