5|$|As Paul, Christine and Michael {{continue}} to hit dead ends on solving Carmine's murder, <b>Fen</b> announces {{he wants to}} confess to a judge and be sentenced prison time; Christine and Lauren however are strongly against it. Just as <b>Fen</b> decides {{he is going to}} confess to the judge, Michael discovers that Carmine is in fact alive. He reveals that he was in fact being transported into witness protection the day of the banquet for giving the FBI evidence against another criminal, but he wanted to see Lauren one last time. <b>Fen</b> shot him that night but doctors and medical examiners secretly revived him and sent him into witness protection. He refuses to return to Genoa City to exonerate <b>Fen</b> because of his own safety, so instead Michael films him confessing that he is alive. Michael arrives with the video before <b>Fen</b> can confess, and he is exonerated. After being reunited with his family, Michael and Lauren later mention that <b>Fen</b> had gone to Arizona to visit potential colleges.|$|E
5|$|The {{management}} of Deeping <b>Fen</b> by trustees, appointed {{under the terms}} of the 1801 Act, continued until they were replaced in 1939 by the Deeping <b>Fen,</b> Spalding and Pinchbeck Internal Drainage Board, subsequently renamed the Welland & Deepings Internal Drainage Board.|$|E
5|$|Several {{prominent}} {{civil engineer}} considered {{the problems of}} Deeping <b>Fen</b> and the river outfall {{at the end of}} the 1700s. Two reports were produced, one by George Maxwell, and the second by Edward Hare, who had been assisted by William Jessop and John Rennie. They formed the basis for the Deeping <b>Fen</b> Act of 1801. The channel above Spalding was made deeper, the north bank was made stronger, and the North and South Drove Drains were enlarged through the <b>fen.</b> One of Rennie's recommendations had been to replace the windmills which drove the drainage pumps with a steam pumping station at Pode Hole, but this was not implemented. After reports by Rennie and Thomas Pear in 1815, and by Rennie alone in 1818 and 1820, the provision of steam engines was authorised by an act in 1823. The trustees appointed by the 1801 act continued to manage Deeping <b>Fen</b> until they were replaced in 1939 by the Deeping <b>Fen,</b> Spalding and Pinchbeck Internal Drainage Board, subsequently renamed the Welland & Deepings Internal Drainage Board.|$|E

5|$|The <b>fen</b> was {{inundated}} in 1798, and {{the civil}} engineers William Jessop and John Rennie were asked to assist the local engineers Edward Hare and George Maxwell. There was a clear understanding that the outfalls were too high to allow proper drainage by gravity, and two possible solutions were considered. The first was an outfall at a lower level, which would involve hugh expense in its construction, and the second, favoured by Jessop and Rennie, was the provision of steam pumping engines at Pode Hole. These would pump water from the internal drains of the <b>fen</b> to Vernatt's Drain, and the lower internal water levels would allow the existing wind-powered drainage mills to work efficiently. A report was produced, which {{formed the basis for}} the Deeping <b>Fen</b> Act of 1801. The channel of the Welland above Spalding was made deeper, the north bank was made stronger, and the North and South Drove Drains which crossed the <b>fen</b> to join Vernatt's Drain at Pode Hole were made deeper. At the time there were no steam engines working in the fens, and Rennie's recommendation of a steam pumping station at Pode Hole was not implemented.|$|E

5|$|Modular {{system of}} architecture, eight {{standard}} grades: Although other texts preceded it, {{such as the}} 'National Building Law' of the Tang Dynasty (618–907) which was partially preserved in other texts, the Yingzao Fashi published in 1103 by the Song Dynasty (960–1279) scholar-official Li Jie (1065–1110) is the oldest known Chinese architectural treatise that has survived fully intact. It contains descriptions and illustrations detailing the cai <b>fen</b> system (材份制) of eight standard dimensions for module components of timber architecture and structural carpentry. The eight standard grades of module timber components in the Yingzao Fashi, with grade I being the largest and grade VIII the smallest, {{were used to determine}} the ultimate proportions and scale of a building as a whole, as all timber hall types—palaces, mansions, ordinary houses, and pavilions—were hierarchically categorized along the lines of which cai <b>fen</b> grade was employed. For example, palace type buildings used only grades I through V, while mansion type buildings never used components larger than grade III and no less than grade VI. In this system of structural carpentry, the smallest grade of VIII is represented by one cai; one cai is equal to the modern equivalent of 15cm (5.9in), while one cai is also divided into fifteen <b>fen</b> (hence the title of this modular system).|$|E

5|$|Essex {{has one of}} {{the longest}} coastlines of any English county, with saltmarshes, lagoons, mudflats, grazing marshes, reedbeds and shingle.

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to drain Holland <b>Fen,</b> and prevent {{flooding}} from the River Witham, an adventurer called Earl Fitzwilliam constructed a drain in 1720, which runs broadly parallel to the River Witham, and terminated at Lodewick's Gowt, a sluice which he constructed on the Witham close {{to the location of}} the present Grand Sluice. The drain was for many years called Earl Fitzwilliam's drain, but is now called the North Forty-Foot Drain. The scheme was not entirely successful.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, {{its range}} is {{currently}} restricted to about 45km {{of the banks}} of the River Ouse centred on York, North Yorkshire. Although there are scattered records from across England some of these may represent mis-identifications of the mint beetle, a more widespread species. Tansy beetles had previously been recorded from Wicken <b>Fen,</b> Cambridgeshire, where species of mint (Mentha spp.), not tansy, acted as the host plant. The last accurate record for the beetle at this site was in 1981. In August 2014 a new sighting was made nearby at Woodwalton <b>Fen,</b> following which a relocation programme involving hundreds of adult beetles from Yorkshire to this site was undertaken. As of 2006 there were 19 British hectads (10km squares) with records of the tansy beetle, but it has only been seen in 11 of these since 1970, six of which are centred around York.
