5|$|Each legion was {{normally}} {{partnered with}} an approximately {{equal number of}} allied (non-Roman) auxiliae troops. The addition of allied troops to the Roman army was a formalisation of the earlier arrangement of using light troops from the Socii and Latini, who had received Roman citizenship after the Social War. Auxiliary troops could be formed from either auxiliary light cavalry known as alae, auxiliary light infantry known as cohors auxiliae, or a flexible mixture of the two known as cohors equitata. Cavalry types included mounted archers (Latin: sagittarii) and <b>heavy</b> <b>shock</b> cavalry (Latin: cataphracti or clibanarii). Infantry could be armed with bows, slings, throwing spears, long swords, or thrusting spears. Auxiliary units were originally led by their own chiefs, and, in this period, their internal organisation was left to their commanders.|$|E
2500|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the al-Aqsa Intifada (2000), Gush Katif settlements were the target of thousands of violent attacks by Palestinian militants. More than 6000 mortar bombs and Qassam rockets were launched into Gush Katif, miraculously causing only few fatalities though tremendous property and psychological damage and <b>heavy</b> <b>shock</b> and fear. Most of the ground attacks were infiltrations and shootings. There were also attempts to infiltrate by sea. Victims include Itamar Yefet (18), who was shot and killed by a Palestinian sniper in November 2000. Arik Krogliak, Tal Kurtzweil, Asher Marcus, Eran Picard, and Ariel Zana, all teenagers, were fatally shot in March 2002 when terrorists infiltrated the [...] "Otzem" [...] pre-military academy in Atzmona.|$|E
2500|$|The two enemies {{exemplified}} {{two different}} approaches to warfare: the Roman army was traditionally infantry-based, relying on its excellent legions, while the Parthians were excellent horsemen, employing the <b>heavy</b> <b>shock</b> [...] "cataphract" [...] cavalry (grivpanvar), mounted on horses or camels, in combination {{with large numbers of}} horse-archers. The two armies met near the Roman city of Nisibis (the exact date is unclear). According to Cassius Dio, the first skirmish occurred over the possession of a watering-place. On the first day of battle, the Romans deployed in a typical formation, with their infantry in the centre and their cavalry and light troops (Moorish javelin throwers) on the wings to protect their flanks. At the same time, between the gaps left by the heavy infantry cohorts, they placed light infantry. These could skirmish forward and then withdraw to the safety of the heavier formations if necessary.|$|E

50|$|The {{beginning}} of this year 1812 may be singularized by the shaking of the earth, which occurred so often {{that it would be}} both tedious and useless to have noticed every one. On the 14th of February, 2 hours before day, was the <b>heaviest</b> <b>shock</b> that was felt on the Wabash. A number of brick houses were cracked and the tops of some chimneys fell off. From carried information, we learn, that the shaking occurs almost daily in New Madrid, that the earth's motion appears to be about 12 inches horizontally in a north and south direction, that large chasms can be seen in many directions, some of which are a mile or more in length, from which muddy water and sulphurous vapors sometimes issue, almost sufficient to suffocate the frightened inhabitants.|$|R

60|$|The {{preparations}} consumed some time; for the Romans had {{not only}} to build the ships, they had first {{to learn how to}} build them. They took their first lesson from a Carthaginian galley which was cast away in a storm upon the coast of Italy. They seized this galley, collected their carpenters to examine it, and set woodmen at work to fell trees and collect materials for imitating it. The carpenters studied their model very carefully, measured the dimensions of every part, and observed {{the manner in which the}} various parts were connected and secured together. The <b>heavy</b> <b>shocks</b> which vessels are exposed to from the waves makes it necessary to secure great strength in the construction of them; and, though the ships of the ancients were very small and imperfect compared with the men-of-war of the present day, still it is surprising that the Romans could succeed at all in such a sudden and hasty attempt at building them.|$|R

40|$|The time of protostellar wind {{breakout}} may {{be determined}} by the evolution of the infalling flow, rather than any sudden change in the central engine. I examine the transition from pure infall to outflow, {{in the context of the}} inside-out collapse of a rotating molecular cloud core. I have followed numerically the motion of the shocked shell created by the impact of a stellar wind and infalling gas. These fully time-dependent calculations include cases both where the shell falls back to the stellar surface, and where it breaks out as a true outflow. Assuming a wind launched from the protostellar surface, the breakout time is determined in terms of the parameters describing the wind (˙ Mw, Vw) and collapsing cloud core (a◦, Ω). The trapped wind phase consists of a wind sufficiently strong to push material back from the stellar surface, but too weak to carry the <b>heavy,</b> <b>shocked</b> infall out of the star’s gravitational potential. To produce a large-scale outflow, the shocked material must be able to climb out of the star’s gravitational potential well, carrying with it the dense, swept-up infall...|$|R
60|$|The boat glanced {{with a hard}} grind on a {{rock and}} shot down a long yellow incline; a great curling wave whirled back on Lane; a <b>heavy</b> <b>shock</b> sent him flying from his seat; a gurgling demoniacal roar {{deafened}} his ears and a cold eager flood engulfed him. He was drawn under, as the whirlpool sucks a feather; he was tossed up, as the wind throws a straw. The boat bobbed upright near him. He grasped the gunwale and held on.|$|E

There was a <b>heavy</b> <b>shock</b> as the light wheels struck a fallen branch on leaving the graded road. The vehicle lurched, and Millicent, whose eyes were wide with terror, screamed faintly. Geoffrey still stood upright driving the team straight ahead down a more open glade of the forest. He knew that the stems of the fern and the soft ground beneath would soon bring them to a standstill {{if they did not}} strike a tree-trunk first.|$|E
60|$|They moved {{towards the}} gangway, past the hatch where some heavy cases were being hoisted up, and Dick {{carefully}} put {{the letters in}} his pocket.

60|$|Devine, however, {{looked more}} closely about, and it struck {{him that the}} ground had dried with {{remarkable}} rapidity; indeed, {{if he had not}} felt the hail, he could hardly have believed the plain had been wet. For all that, not venturing to hope for fear of meeting a <b>heavier</b> <b>shock,</b> he said nothing to his comrade, and presently they dipped into a hollow. They could not see across the ridge in front, and Harding urged his horses savagely when they came to the ascent. The animals' coats were foul, spume dripped from the bits, and their sides were white where the traces slapped, but they breasted the hill pluckily. The men were grim and highly strung, braced to meet the worst. To Harding it meant ruin and the downfall of all his plans; to Devine his wedding put off. It might be some years before he made good, and he feared that he could no longer count on his comrade's help. If Harding were forced to give up his farm, he might leave the prairie.|$|R

60|$|It was {{the next}} day when Geoffrey had an {{interview}} with Helen, who sent for him. She was standing beside a window when he came in. She looked tall in a long somber-tinted dress which emphasized the whiteness of her full round throat and the pallor of her face. The faint, olive coloring of her skin had faded; there were shadows about her eyes. At the first glance Geoffrey's heart went out towards her. It was evident the verdict of the physicians had been a <b>heavy</b> <b>shock,</b> but he fancied that she was ready to meet the inevitable with undiminished courage. Still, her fingers were cold when, for a moment, they touched his own.|$|E
40|$|The time of protostellar wind {{breakout}} may {{be determined}} by the time-dependence of the infalling flow, rather than any sudden change in the driving wind. I examine the transition from pure infall to simultaneous infall and outflow, or pure outflow, in the context of rotating, inside-out collapse. Assuming a protostellar wind launched from the stellar surface, the breakout time is determined {{as a function of the}} wind's mass-loss rate and speed, as well as the infall and rotation rate of the collapsing cloud core. The trapped phase consists of a wind su#ciently strong to push material back from the stellar surface, but too weak to carry the <b>heavy,</b> <b>shocked</b> infall out of the star's gravitational potential. Unless the wind turns on impulsively, a significant fraction of the pre-breakout life of the protostar may be spent in this trapped wind phase in which gas is launched from the protostar but is pulled back, crashing onto the protostellar and disk surfaces. It may be that some "starless cores" contain as-yet undetected, very young accreting protostars, and that episodic luminosity fluctuations associated with this trapped wind could be observed...|$|R

60|$|She reigned {{about forty}} years, and during almost {{all that time}} the whole {{western part of the}} Continent of Europe was convulsed with the most terrible {{conflicts}} between the Protestant and Catholic parties. The predominance of power was with the Catholics, and was, of course, hostile to Elizabeth. She had, moreover, in the field a very prominent competitor for her throne in Mary Queen of Scots. The foreign Protestant powers were ready to aid this claimant, and there was, besides, in her own dominions a very powerful interest in her favor. The great divisions of sentiment in England, and the energy with which each party struggled against its opponents, produced, at all times, a prodigious pressure of opposing forces, which bore heavily upon the safety of the state and of Elizabeth's government, and threatened them with continual danger. The administration of public affairs moved on, during all this time, trembling continually under the <b>heavy</b> <b>shocks</b> it was constantly receiving, like a ship staggering on in a storm, its safety depending on the nice equilibrium between the shocks of the seas, the pressure of the wind upon the sails, and the weight and steadiness of the ballast below.|$|R
