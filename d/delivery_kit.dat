40|$|BACKGROUND: Globally, puerperal sepsis {{accounts}} {{for an estimated}} 8 - 12 % of maternal deaths, but evidence is lacking {{on the extent to}} which clean delivery practices could improve maternal survival. We used data from the control arms of four cluster-randomised controlled trials conducted in rural India, Bangladesh and Nepal, to examine associations between clean <b>delivery</b> <b>kit</b> use and hand washing by the birth attendant with maternal mortality among home deliveries. METHODS: We tested associations between clean delivery practices and maternal deaths, using a pooled dataset for 40, 602 home births across sites in the three countries. Cross-sectional data were analysed by fitting logistic regression models with and without multiple imputation, and confounders were selected a priori using causal directed acyclic graphs. The robustness of estimates was investigated through sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Hand washing was associated with a 49 % reduction in the odds of maternal mortality after adjusting for confounding factors (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 0. 51, 95 % CI 0. 28 - 0. 93). The sensitivity analysis testing the missing at random assumption for the multiple imputation, as well as the sensitivity analysis accounting for possible misclassification bias in the use of clean delivery practices, indicated that the association between hand washing and maternal death had been over estimated. Clean <b>delivery</b> <b>kit</b> use was not associated with a maternal death (AOR 1. 26, 95 % CI 0. 62 - 2. 56). CONCLUSIONS: Our evidence suggests that hand washing in delivery is critical for maternal survival among home deliveries in rural South Asia, although the exact magnitude of this effect is uncertain due to inherent biases associated with observational data from low resource settings. Our findings indicating kit use does not improve maternal survival, suggests that the soap is not being used in all instances that kit use is being reported. Published onlin...|$|E

40|$|A {{qualitative}} inquiry {{was used}} to assess if incentives consisting of a hygiene kit, protein-fortified flour, and <b>delivery</b> <b>kit</b> reduced barriers to antenatal care and delivery services in Nyanza Province, Kenya. We conducted 40 interviews (baseline: five nurses, six mothers, one focus group of five mothers; follow-up: nine nurses, 19 mothers) to assess perceptions of these services. Mothers and nurses identified poor quality of care, fear of HIV diagnosis and stigma, inadequate transport, and cost of care as barriers. Nurses believed incentives encouraged women to use services; mothers described wanting good birth outcomes as their motivation. While barriers to care did not change during the study, incentives may have increased service use. These findings suggest that structural improvements-upgraded infrastructure, adequate staffing, improved treatment of women by nurses, low or no-cost services, and provision of transport-could increase satisfaction with and use of services, improving maternal and infant health.

Results of the interviews showed that the attendants who used the kit perceived it as hygienic and convenient, affordable, and culturally acceptable. The razor blade and thread were the most useful items, and the purpose of the plastic coin was understood. Despite its perceived usefulness, awareness and use of the kit were low, and common reasons for non-use included not knowing about the kit or difficulty in procuring a kit locally. In addition, the kit had limited influence on general hygiene practices.

40|$|Despite various {{efforts to}} {{increase}} the utilization of skilled birth attendants (SBA), nearly two-thirds of deliveries take place at home without the assistance of SBAs in Nepal. We hypothesized that the ability of women to take decisions about their own lives-women's autonomy-plays {{an important part in}} birth choices. To know this, we conducted a community-based cross-sectional study for assessing women's autonomy and utilization of safe delivery care service in Kapilvastu district of Nepal from June to October 2014. We used multivariate modeling to associate socioeconomic factors and women's autonomy with the utilization of safe delivery care services. Just over one-third of women sought institutional delivery care during the birth of their last child. Out of the total deliveries at health facilities, nearly 58 % women visited health facility for self-reported emergency obstructive care. Only 6. 2 % home deliveries were handled by health workers and 14. 7 % women used the safe <b>delivery</b> <b>kit</b> for home delivery care. Higher levels of women's education had a strong positive association (odds ratio = 24. 11, CI = 9. 43 - 61. 64) with institutional delivery care. Stratified analysis showed that when the husband is educated, women's education seems to work partly through their autonomy in decision making. Educational status of women {{emerged as one of the}} key predictors of the utilization of delivery care services in Kapilvastu district. Economic status of household and husband's education are other dominant predictors of the utilization of safe delivery care services. Improving the economic and educational status may be the way out for improving the proportion of institutional deliveries. Women's autonomy may be an important mediating factor in this pathway...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Early {{detection}} of neonatal illness {{is an important}} step towards improving newborn survival. Every year an estimated 3. 07 million children die during their first month of life and about one-third of these deaths occur during the first 24 hours. Ninety-eight percent of all neonatal deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries like Uganda. Inadequate progress has been made globally {{to reduce the amount of}} neonatal deaths that would be required to meet Millennium Development Goal 4. Poor knowledge of newborn danger signs delays care seeking. The aim of this study was to explore the knowledge of key newborn danger signs among mothers in southwestern Uganda. METHODS: Results from a community survey of 765 recently delivered women were analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regressions. Six key danger signs were identified, and spontaneous responses were categorized, tabulated, and analyzed. RESULTS: Knowledge of at least one key danger sign was significantly associated with being birth prepared (adjusted OR 1. 7, 95 % CI 1. 2 - 2. 3). Birth preparedness consisted of saving money, identifying transportation, identifying a skilled birth attendant and buying a <b>delivery</b> <b>kit</b> or materials. Overall, respondents had a poor knowledge of key newborn danger signs: 58. 2 % could identify one and 14. 8 % could identify two. We found no association between women attending the recommended number of antenatal care visits and their knowledge of danger signs (adjusted OR 1. 0, 95 % CI 0. 8 - 1. 4), or between women using a skilled birth attendant at delivery and their knowledge of danger signs (adjusted OR 1. 2, 95 % CI 0. 9 - 1. 7). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate the need to enhance education of mothers in antenatal care as well as those discharged from health facilities after delivery.

40|$|Background: Each year, {{more than}} 200 million {{children}} under the age of 5 years, almost all in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), fail to achieve their developmental potential. Risk factors for compromised development often coexist and include inadequate cognitive stimulation, poverty, nutritional deficiencies, infection and complications of being born low birthweight and/or premature. Moreover, many of these risk factors are closely associated with newborn morbidity and mortality. As compromised development has significant implications on human capital, inexpensive and scalable interventions are urgently needed to promote neurodevelopment and reduce risk factors for impaired development. Method/Design: This cluster randomized trial aims at evaluating the impact of volunteer community health workers delivering either an integrated neonatal survival kit, an early stimulation package, or a combination of both interventions, to pregnant women during their third trimester of pregnancy, compared to the current standard of care in Kwale County, Kenya. The neonatal survival kit comprises a clean <b>delivery</b> <b>kit</b> (sterile blade, cord clamp, clean plastic sheet, surgical gloves and hand soap), sunflower oil emollient, chlorhexidine, ThermoSpot(TM), Mylar infant sleeve, and a reusable instant heater. Community health workers are also equipped with a portable hand-held electric scale. The early cognitive stimulation package focuses on enhancing caregiver practices by teaching caregivers three key messages that comprise combining a gentle touch with making eye contact and talking to children, responsive feeding and caregiving, and singing. The primary outcome measure is child development at 12 months of age assessed with the Protocol for Child Monitoring (Infant and Toddler version). The main secondary outcome is newborn mortality. Discussion: This study will provide evidence on effectiveness of delivering an innovative neonatal survival kit and/or early stimulation package to pregnant women in Kwale County, Kenya. Study findings will help inform policy on the most appropriate interventions for promoting healthy brain development and reduction of newborn morbidity and mortality in Kenya and other similar setting...|$|E
40|$|Background: Every year an {{estimated}} three million neonates die globally and {{two hundred thousand}} of these deaths occur in Pakistan. Majority of these neonates die in rural areas of underdeveloped countries from preventable causes (infections, complications related to low birth weight and prematurity). Similarly about three hundred thousand mother died in 2010 and Pakistan is among ten countries where sixty percent burden of these deaths is concentrated. Maternal and neonatal mortality remain to be unacceptably high in Pakistan especially in rural areas where {{more than half of}} births occur. Method/Design: This community based cluster randomized controlled trial will evaluate the impact of an Emergency Obstetric and Newborn Care (EmONC) package in the intervention arm compared to standard of care in control arm. Perinatal and neonatal mortality are primary outcome measure for this trial. The trial will be implemented in 20 clusters (Union councils) of District Rahimyar Khan, Pakistan. The EmONC package consists of provision of maternal and neonatal health pack (clean <b>delivery</b> <b>kit,</b> emollient, chlorhexidine) for safe motherhood and newborn wellbeing and training of community level and facility based health care providers with emphasis on referral of complicated cases to nearest public health facilities and community mobilization. Discussion: Even though there is substantial evidence in support of effectiveness of various health interventions for improving maternal, neonatal and child health. Reduction in perinatal and neonatal mortality remains a big challenge in resource constrained and diverse countries like Pakistan and achieving MDG 4 and 5 appears to be a distant reality. A comprehensive package of community based low cost interventions along the continuum of care tailored according to the socio cultural environment coupled with existing health force capacity building may result in improving the maternal and neonatal outcomes. The findings of this proposed community based trial will provide sufficient evidence on feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness to the policy makers for replicating and scaling up the interventions within the health syste...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background About 98 % of newborn deaths {{occur in}} {{developing}} countries, where most newborns deaths occur at home. In Nepal, approximately, 90 % of deliveries {{take place at}} home. Information about reasons for delivering at home and newborn care practices in urban areas of Nepal is lacking and such information will be useful for policy makers. Methods A cross-sectional survey {{was carried out in}} the immunisation clinics of Pokhara city, western Nepal during January and February, 2006. Two trained health workers administered a semi-structured questionnaire to the mothers who had delivered at home. Results A total of 240 mothers were interviewed. Planned home deliveries were 140 (58. 3 %) and 100 (41. 7 %) were unplanned. Only 6. 2 % of deliveries had a skilled birth attendant present and 38 (15. 8 %) mothers gave birth alone. Only 46 (16. 2 %) women had used a clean home <b>delivery</b> <b>kit</b> and only 92 (38. 3 %) birth attendants had washed their hands. The umbilical cord was cut after expulsion of placenta in 154 (64. 2 %) deliveries and cord was cut using a new/boiled blade in 217 (90. 4 %) deliveries. Mustard oil was applied to the umbilical cord in 53 (22. 1 %) deliveries. Birth place was heated throughout the delivery in 88 (64. 2 %) deliveries. Only 100 (45. 8 %) newborns were wrapped within 10 minutes and 233 (97. 1 %) were wrapped within 30 minutes. Majority (93. 8 %) of the newborns were given a bath soon after birth. Mustard oil massage of the newborns was a common practice (144, 60 %). Sixteen (10. 8 %) mothers did not feed colostrum to their babies. Prelacteal feeds were given to 37 (15. 2 %) newborns. Initiation rates of breast-feeding were 57. 9 % within one hour and 85. 4 % within 24 hours. Main reasons cited for delivering at home were 'preference' (25. 7 %), 'ease and convenience' (21. 4 %) for planned deliveries while 'precipitate labor' (51 %), 'lack of transportation' (18 %) and 'lack of escort' during labor (11 %) were cited for the unplanned ones. Conclusion High-risk home delivery and newborn care practices are common in urban population also. In-depth qualitative studies are needed to explore the reasons for delivering at home. Community-based interventions are required to improve the number of families engaging a skilled attendant and hygiene during delivery. The high-risk traditional newborn care practices like delayed wrapping, bathing, mustard oil massage, prelacteal feeding and discarding colostrum need to be addressed by culturally acceptable community-based health education programmes. </p...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{establish}} {{the context in}} which maternal psychosocial well-being is understood in war-affected settings in Eritrea. Method: Pretested and validated participatory methods and tools of investigation and analysis were employed to allow participants to engage in processes of qualitative data collection, on-site analysis, and interpretation. Findings: Maternal psychosocial well-being in Eritrea is maintained primarily by traditional systems of social support that are mostly outside the domain of statutory primary care. Traditional birth attendants provide a vital link between the two. Formal training and regular supplies of sterile <b>delivery</b> <b>kits</b> appear to be worthwhile options for health policy and practice {{in the face of the}} post-conflict challenges of ruined infrastructure and an overstretched and/or ill-mannered workforce in the maternity health service.

40|$|Husbands {{can play}} a crucial role in {{pregnancy}} and childbirth, especially in patriarchal societies of developing countries. In Myanmar, despite the critical influence of husbands on the health of mothers and newborns, their roles in maternal health have not been well explored. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify the factors associated with husbands' involvement in maternal health in Myanmar. This study also examined the associations between husbands' involvement and their spouses' utilization of maternal care services during antenatal, delivery and postnatal periods. A community-based, cross sectional study was conducted with 426 husbands in Thingangyun Township, Yangon, Myanmar. Participants were husbands aged 18 years or older who had at least one child within two years at the time of interview. Face to face interviews were conducted using a pretested structured questionnaire. Factors associated with the characteristics of husband's involvement as well as their spouses' utilization of maternal care services were analyzed by multivariable logistic regression models. Of 426 husbands, 64. 8 % accompanied their spouses for an antenatal visit more than once while 51. 6 % accompanied them for a postnatal visit. Husbands were major financial supporters for both antenatal (95. 8 %) and postnatal care (68. 5 %). Overall, 69. 7 % were involved in decision making about the place of delivery. Regarding birth preparedness, the majority of husbands prepared for skilled birth attendance (91. 1 %), delivery place (83. 6 %), and money saving (81. 7 %) before their spouses gave birth. In contrast, fewer planned for a potential blood donor (15. 5 %) and a safe <b>delivery</b> <b>kit</b> (21. 1 %). In the context of maternal health, predictors of husband's involvement were parity, educational level, type of marriage, decision making level in family, exposure to maternal health education and perception of risk during pregnancy and childbirth. Increased utilization of maternal health services was found among spouses of husbands who accompanied them to antenatal visits (AOR 5. 82, 95 % CI, 3. 34 - 10. 15) and those who had a well birth plan (AOR 2. 42, 95 % CI, 1. 34 - 4. 39 for antenatal visit and AOR 2. 88, 95 % CI, 1. 52 - 5. 47 for postnatal visit). The majority of husbands supported their spouses' maternal care services use financially; however, they were less involved in birth preparedness and postnatal care. Exposure to maternal health education and their maternal health knowledge were main predictors of their involvement. Women were more likely to use maternal care services when their husbands company them for ANC visits and had a well-birth plan in advance...|$|E
40|$|The World Health Organization {{recommends}} participatory {{learning and}} action (PLA) in women's groups to improve maternal and newborn health, particularly in rural settings with low {{access to health}} services. There have been calls to understand the pathways through which this community intervention may affect neonatal mortality. We examined the effect of women's groups on key antenatal, delivery, and postnatal behaviours {{in order to understand}} pathways to mortality reduction. We conducted a meta-analysis using data from 7 cluster-randomised controlled trials that took place between 2001 and 2012 in rural India (2 trials), urban India (1 trial), rural Bangladesh (2 trials), rural Nepal (1 trial), and rural Malawi (1 trial), with the number of participants ranging between 6, 125 and 29, 901 live births. Behavioural outcomes included appropriate antenatal care, facility delivery, use of a safe <b>delivery</b> <b>kit,</b> hand washing by the birth attendant prior to delivery, use of a sterilised instrument to cut the umbilical cord, immediate wrapping of the newborn after delivery, delayed bathing of the newborn, early initiation of breastfeeding, and exclusive breastfeeding. We used 2 -stage meta-analysis techniques to estimate the effect of the women's group intervention on behavioural outcomes. In the first stage, we used random effects models with individual patient data to assess the effect of groups on outcomes separately for the different trials. In the second stage of the meta-analysis, random effects models were applied using summary-level estimates calculated in the first stage of the analysis. To determine whether behaviour change was related to group attendance, we used random effects models to assess associations between outcomes and the following categories of group attendance and allocation: women attending a group and allocated to the intervention arm; women not attending a group but allocated to the intervention arm; and women allocated to the control arm. Overall, women's groups practising PLA improved behaviours during and after home deliveries, including the use of safe delivery kits (odds ratio [OR] 2. 92, 95 % CI 2. 02 - 4. 22; I 2 = 63. 7 %, 95 % CI 4. 4 %- 86. 2 %), use of a sterile blade to cut the umbilical cord (1. 88, 1. 25 - 2. 82; 67. 6 %, 16. 1 %- 87. 5 %), birth attendant washing hands prior to delivery (1. 87, 1. 19 - 2. 95; 79 %, 53. 8 %- 90. 4 %), delayed bathing of the newborn for at least 24 hours (1. 47, 1. 09 - 1. 99; 68. 0 %, 29. 2 %- 85. 6 %), and wrapping the newborn within 10 minutes of delivery (1. 27, 1. 02 - 1. 60; 0. 0 %, 0 %- 79. 2 %). Effects were partly dependent on the proportion of pregnant women attending groups. We did not find evidence of effects on uptake of antenatal care (OR 1. 03, 95 % CI 0. 77 - 1. 38; I 2 = 86. 3 %, 95 % CI 73. 8 %- 92. 8 %), facility delivery (1. 02, 0. 93 - 1. 12; 21. 4 %, 0 %- 65. 8 %), initiating breastfeeding within 1 hour (1. 08, 0. 85 - 1. 39; 76. 6 %, 50. 9 %- 88. 8 %), or exclusive breastfeeding for 6 weeks after delivery (1. 18, 0. 93 - 1. 48; 72. 9 %, 37. 8 %- 88. 2 %). The main limitation of our analysis is the high degree of heterogeneity for effects on most behaviours, possibly due to the limited number of trials involving women's groups and context-specific effects. This meta-analysis suggests that women's groups practising PLA improve key behaviours on the pathway to neonatal mortality, with the strongest evidence for home care behaviours and practices during home deliveries. A lack of consistency in improved behaviours across all trials may reflect differences in local priorities, capabilities, and the responsiveness of health services. Future research could address the mechanisms behind how PLA improves survival, in order to adapt this method to improve maternal and newborn health in different contexts, as well as improve other outcomes across the continuum of care for women, children, and adolescents...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} factors influencing choice of delivery sites in Rakai district of south-western Uganda, eight focus group discussions based on the Attitudes-Social influence-Self efficacy model were held with 32 women and 32 men. Semi-structured interviews were also held with 211 women from 21 random cluster samples who had a delivery in the previous 12 months (from 2 June 1997). Forty four {{percent of the sample}} delivered at home, 17 % at traditional birth attendant's (TBA) place, 32 % at public health units, and 7 % at private clinics. Among the factors influencing choice of delivery site were: access to maternity services; social influence from the spouse, other relatives, TBAs and health workers; self-efficacy; habit (previous experience) and the concept of normal versus abnormal pregnancy. Attitudinal beliefs towards various delivery sites were well understood and articulated. Attendance of ante-natal care may discourage delivery in health units if the mothers are told that the pregnancy is normal. In order to make delivery safer, there is need to improve access to maternity services, train TBAs and equip them with <b>delivery</b> <b>kits,</b> change mother's self-efficacy beliefs, and involve spouses in education about safe delivery.

40|$|The {{study was}} carried out to find out various {{facilities}} available at Sub Health Centres (SHCs) and the actual work performed by the health workers. Physical facilities were assessed in 40 selected SHCs in terms of basic amenities, drugs and supplies including furniture and equipments using a checklist by the research team. The functions of HWs were studied under the different service components viz. antenatal care, natal care, post natal care, immunization, family planning and other national health programs. The work performed by the HWs as per the records maintained by them was taken to represent {{the performance of the}} SHC and was also graded as poor, satisfactory or good. Only 4 out of 40 (10 %) SHCs were found to have good physical facilities followed by satisfactory facilities in 17 SHCs and poor at 19 of the remaining SHCs. At many places the supplies and equipments though adequately available were lying unused (eg. BP instruments, Cu-T insertion <b>kits,</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>kits</b> etc). Regarding services provided by the HWs immunization services were good at 27 (out of 40) SHCs, antenatal services were good only at 5 SHCs, whereas intra natal, family planning and other services were poor at all the 40 SHCs. The overall functioning of SHCs was poor at 27 of the 40 SHCs...|$|R

40|$|Performance-based {{funding has}} been {{proposed}} as one mechanism {{to speed up the}} implementation of interventions for reduced maternal and newborn mortality. This report investigates the potential role of such funding mechanisms in increasing maternal and newborn survival in Tanzania. Less than 50 % of deliveries in Tanzania take place at a health facility. Some of the reasons are diffi cult transport, high costs (e. g., having to pay for <b>delivery</b> <b>kits),</b> and low quality of the services offered at health facilities. Performance-based funding can potentially address some of these challenges, but not all. Demand side issues, such as high costs, can be dealt with by conditional cash transfers to women who deliver at health facilities. Some of the quality issues at the health facilities may be addressed by rewarding health workers according to the number of deliveries, thus making it in their interest {{to improve the quality of}} the service. Performance-based funding cannot, however, fully address the challenges related to poor transport infrastructure, delayed supplies of drugs and equipment from the central level, and the shortage of skilled health workers. In addition, there are challenges related to reliable reporting of performance and timely payment of performance rewards that may undermine the effectiveness of a performance-based funding system. Our knowledge of the effect of performance-based funding in the health sector is very limited. Thorough impact research therefore needs to be part of new initiatives of this kind...|$|R
