5|$|Whitney {{decides to}} give Lee another chance on the {{condition}} that he will never assault her again, therefore he should seek anger management therapy. Lee gratefully accepts for the sake of their marriage. However, on Valentine's Day, Lee leaves Whitney, leaving a handwritten note on their bed saying he no longer loves her. He returns the following day, apologising to Whitney for his actions and tells her of his plans to move to Dover. An upset Whitney, realising that Lee plans to leave on his own to figure himself out, tells him to leave and she watches him from the window as he drives off. Whitney becomes closer to Mick in Linda's absence and is warned by Shirley to stay away from him. When Mick leaves to look after Nancy when she is hit by a car Whitney is left in charge of running the pub. She later steals Vincent Hubbard's (Richard Blackwood) credit card to pay for a dog pen for Lady Di (Hot Lips), as the Carters cannot afford it due to their debts. Whitney later grows close to new bar manager Woody Woodward (Lee Ryan). Lee attempts to call Whitney but Woody tells Lee that she does not want to speak to him, so Lee sends his friend Moose (Sam Gittins) to see her, who says that Lee wants a divorce. Whitney receives a letter from Lee's solicitor, citing her unreasonable behaviour as grounds for the divorce, but Woody tells her it is not a big deal. Whitney declares that she is going to move on with her life and goes out shopping, but Woody sees she has not taken her purse and goes to <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> Whitney is caught shoplifting by a security guard, who offers her sex in exchange for not calling the police. Woody arrives and punches the guard, and takes Whitney home. Whitney and Woody kiss and have sex, and then a returning Mick finds them in bed together. Mick finds more items that Whitney has shoplifted, and she says she should never have married Lee as she is damaged and only good for sex but he tells her she is wrong and promises not to leave again. Mick lashes out at Whitney after learning that Linda and Shirley sold the freehold of the Vic without his knowledge to pay for an operation for Lady Di. A few days later, Whitney is depressed and vulnerable and, when Mick kisses her, she responds. When Shirley finds out about the kiss, she orders Whitney to get out, telling her that Mick would never choose her over Linda. Devastated, Whitney leaves Walford.|$|E
500|$|Everyone reminisces {{about the}} huge meal and much fun ("This Was a Real Nice Clambake"). [...] Jigger tries to seduce Carrie; Enoch walks {{in at the}} wrong moment, and {{declares}} that he is finished with her ("Geraniums In the Winder"), as Jigger jeers ("There's Nothin' So Bad for a Woman"). The girls try to comfort Carrie, but for Julie all that matters is that [...] "he's your feller and you love him" [...] ("What's the Use of Wond'rin'?"). [...] Julie sees Billy trying to sneak away with Jigger and, trying to stop him, feels the knife hidden in his shirt. [...] She begs him to <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> but he refuses and leaves to commit the robbery.|$|E
500|$|... "Since U Been Gone" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by American singer Kelly Clarkson from her second studio album, Breakaway (2004). The song, which was written and produced by Max Martin and Lukasz [...] "Dr. Luke" [...] Gottwald, was released as the lead single from Breakaway {{two weeks before the}} album was released. It is an uptempo pop rock and power pop power ballad that infuses electronic sound with a mixture of soft and loud alternative rock sound. Martin originally wrote [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] with Pink in mind but she turned it down. It was then given to Hilary Duff but she rejected the song because she could not reach its higher notes. The song was finally given to Clarkson after Clive Davis convinced the writers to <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> Clarkson decided to add heavier guitars and harder drums to the song after noticing that the demo had an obvious pop sound. Lyrically, the song is written from a woman's point of view where she expresses her sense of relief with the end of her troubled relationship.|$|E

2500|$|By all accounts, Nadezhda von Meck was {{imperious}} by nature, {{presiding over}} her household despotically. She {{expected to have}} her own way, so surrounded herself only with people who would <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> and she ruled her children's lives in every detail. [...] As they grew into adulthood, she arranged their marriages, bought houses for them, and even chose furniture for their houses. When {{she wanted to see}} her married children, she summoned rather than invited them. [...] Understandably, her children were not always grateful for the extreme degree of their mother's care (or meddling, depending on the viewpoint of the person concerned).|$|E
2500|$|In 1974, after {{a sabbatical}} of several years, Harrison {{attempted}} {{to return to}} her career. She desperately wanted the role of Roy Scheider's wife in Jaws, and urged her husband to <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> Zanuck asked director Steven Spielberg if he would consider Harrison, but Spielberg preferred actress Lorraine Gary, whom he had seen in a TV movie, The Marcus Nelson Murders, and cast her instead of Harrison [...] "because she was right for the part." [...] Harrison was upset over Spielberg's preference for Gary, feeling that her husband should have gotten her the part. [...] "I really wanted Dick to go to bat for me this one time." [...] As a consolation, Universal chief Sid Sheinberg, Lorraine Gary's husband, got Harrison a part in Airport 1975 as Gloria Swanson's personal assistant, Winnie. Though the movie starred Harrison's long-time idol, Charlton Heston, Harrison had no scenes with him, and [...] "would have much rather had Jaws on my resume." [...] Years later, in an April 2012 interview, Harrison offered a reason she had lost the role because [...] "They said Roy Scheider couldn't get a girl as beautiful as me." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{they set}} a wedding date, Harold Bishop (Ian Smith), {{who was married}} to Daniel's {{grandmother}} Madge (Anne Charleston), returned to Erinsborough for the ceremony. He gave Daniel some advice about marriage, telling him to have [...] "realistic expectations." [...] Phillipps thought that Daniel and Amber were rushing into marriage, but explained that the producers wanted the wedding to air {{as part of the}} show's 30th anniversary in March 2015. He thought they should have waited another year. Phillipps also admitted that he did not think Amber and Daniel were well suited, saying [...] "they are very easygoing people and I am not sure if that creates the best sparks." [...] On the day of his wedding, Daniel decided to be [...] "a hopeless romantic" [...] and try to get Amber an antique ring from a well that belonged to his ancestor. Phillipps explained that Amber had been obsessing about the love story connected to the ring and Daniel wanted to <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> on their wedding day. Daniel and Imogen climbed into the well, but the ladder gave way, trapping them down there and forcing Daniel to miss his wedding. While Daniel worried about Amber, she assumed that he had run off with Imogen. After a few days, Josh worked out where Daniel and Imogen were, and they were rescued, leading to a reconciliation between Daniel and Amber.|$|E
2500|$|The {{process of}} {{designing}} Beauty and the Beasts costumes was more collaborative between designer and actor {{than most other}} Broadway productions Hould-Ward had previously worked on, and she frequently sought input from the cast {{to make sure they}} were able to move. Designing Belle's costumes was an [...] "easy" [...] task for Hould-Ward; the character is initially dressed in standard Disney heroine attire until replaced by more elaborate costumes once Belle meets the Beast. Hould-Ward based the character's famous yellow ballgown on several historic portraits. The gown became the first costume built for the production in order to accommodate Disney's mandate to market the dress in photoshoots and commercials starring Egan and Mann, six months prior to rehearsals. Weighing 45 pounds, the dress is a combination of various patterns and materials, including a hoop skirt, silk, brocade, beading, flowers and bows. Too large to fit inside Egan's dressing room after the ballroom sequence, undressing required assistance from three backstage crew members who used wires to hoist the dress up into the rafters, where it would be stored until the next performance. A lot of time was spent designing the Beast's costume, the creation of which was especially challenging due to requirements to [...] "allow enough of the performer to show through." [...] Hould-Ward's initial designs for the Beast were constantly rejected by Katzenberg, who reiterated that she [...] "put the movie onstage" [...] until the producer realized that the excessive prosthetics were limiting Mann's vocal performance. A wire frame was also used to maintain the costume's shape, which evokes heavy metal fashion until ultimately substituted for a black Oscar de la Renta-inspired velvet suit when the Beast finally transforms back into a prince. Hould-Ward designed the leads' costumes from the perspective of her daughter Leah, explaining, [...] "when Leah comes to see it, she remembers from the movie that the Beast was in that blue jacket. Leah expects that blue jacket, and if you don't <b>give</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> she and a lot of other ten-year-olds are going to be sad". At the same time, the designer wanted her creations to be equally as interesting on an intellectual level for parents to enjoy also.|$|E
