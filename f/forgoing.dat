5|$|Another legend {{tells the}} story of {{conversion}} of Chamunda into a Jain goddess. According to this story, Chamunda sculpted the Mahavira image for the temple in Osian, Jodhpur and was happy with the conversions of the Oswals to Jainism. At the time of Navratri, a festival that celebrates the Divine Mother, Chamunda expected animal sacrifices from the converted Jains. The vegetarian Jains, however, were unable to meet her demand. Ratnaprabhasuri intervened, and as a result, Chamunda accepted vegetarian offerings, <b>forgoing</b> her demand for meat and liquor. Ratnaprabhsuri further named her Sacciya, one who had told the truth, as Chamunda had told him the truth that a rainy season stay in Osian would be beneficial for him. She also became the protective goddess of the temple and remained the clan goddess, Kuladevi, of the Oswals. The Sachiya Mata Temple in Osian was built in her honour. Some Jain scriptures warn of dire consequences of worship of Chamunda by the Hindu rites and rituals.|$|E
5|$|As a freshman, he {{was given}} a redshirt year so he did not play during the team's 2005 {{national}} championship season. He served as the quarterback for the scout team in practice against the starting defense. During this time, Matt McCoy (no relation) was officially listed as the number three quarterback behind Vince Young and Matt Nordgren. When Brown chose to play Matt McCoy in four separate game situations where Texas had a commanding lead, confusion arose as to which McCoy was in the game. Many sportscasters mistakenly referred to Matt McCoy as Colt McCoy, as Colt was the more widely known player. The following year, with Young <b>forgoing</b> his senior year to enter the NFL and Nordgren graduating, the position of starting quarterback for the defending National Champion Texas Longhorns came down to a competition between redshirt freshman Colt McCoy and true freshman newcomer Jevan Snead.|$|E

Instead of playing the immersive first-person view that the main career mode presents, songs on GHTV are played over the music video or footage of the band playing at a concert. Songs on GHTV are normally offered in a curated rotation, similar to a music video channel, allowing the player to drop in and out, but the player can use collected in-game rewards or use microtransactions to play any available song outside of this rotation. FreeStyleGames found that this approach, {{in contrast to the}} traditional downloadable content model, made it easier to secure licensing rights with artists to use their songs, as well as a throwback to the heyday of music video channels like MTV.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} {{conclusion}} of the Gator Bowl, Vick was asked by an NBC broadcaster if he intended to return to Virginia Tech for another year of collegiate football. He responded that he would discuss matters with his family and Tech head coach Frank Beamer before making a decision. That announcement sparked a fresh round of speculation from sports pundits and fans wondering if Vick would choose to return to school or enter the 2001 NFL Draft. Virginia Tech, through its football coaching staff, began an intensive lobbying campaign in an effort to convince Vick to stay. On January 11, 2001, Vick held a press conference to announce that he would be <b>forgoing</b> his final two years of collegiate eligibility to enter the NFL Draft.

He frequently visits her and flirts with her in Gautama's absence. At one point, Ahalya receives a visit from Indra's female messenger, who proceeds to mock husbands who avoid sex by saying {{that it is not the}} right day for pleasure. Ahalya protests, maintaining that she imagines Gautama to be Indra as they have sex and that a woman should be a stone, <b>forgoing</b> all thought of sexual gratification. That night, when Ahalya longs for conjugal bliss, Gautama refuses her, saying that she is not in her fertile period. Agitated, she wishes that Indra was there to satisfy her. Indra perceives her wish and comes in Gautama's disguise, but is revealed by his seductive speech. Ignoring the deception, Ahalya joyously makes love to him.|$|E
5|$|Henry's precise {{motivations and}} {{intentions}} {{over the coming}} years are not widely agreed on. Henry himself, {{at least in the}} early part of his reign, was a devout and well-informed Catholic to the extent that his 1521 publication Assertio Septem Sacramentorum ("Defence of the Seven Sacraments") earned him the title of Fidei Defensor (Defender of the Faith) from Pope Leo X. The work represented a staunch defence of papal supremacy, albeit one couched in somewhat contingent terms. It is not clear exactly when Henry changed his mind on the issue as he grew more intent on a second marriage. Certainly, by 1527 he had convinced himself that in marrying Catherine, his brother's wife, he had acted contrary to Leviticus 20:21, an impediment Henry now believed that the Pope never had the authority to dispense with. It was this argument Henry took to Pope Clement VII in 1527 in the hope of having his marriage to Catherine annulled, <b>forgoing</b> at least one less openly defiant line of attack. In going public, all hope of tempting Catherine to retire to a nunnery or otherwise stay quiet were lost. Henry sent his secretary, William Knight, to appeal directly to the Holy See by way of a deceptively worded draft papal bull. Knight was unsuccessful; the Pope could not be misled so easily.|$|E

40|$|Background: Victims of {{intimate}} partner violence (IPV) {{are known to}} refrain from seeking care when in need. Whether the impact on <b>forgone</b> care differs according to the victim-perpetrator role remains unexplored. We aimed to describe the relation between past-year IPV and <b>forgone</b> healthcare according to victims, perpetrators or both (bidirectional). Methods: Adult men and women (n= 3496, aged 18 - 64), randomly sampled {{from the general population}} of Athens, Porto, London, Budapest, Östersund and Stuttgart were assessed using a common questionnaire. IPV was ascertained with the Revised-Conflict-Tactics-Scales. The association between IPV and <b>forgone</b> healthcare (“Have you been in need of a certain care service in the past year, but did not seek any help?”), sociodemographics (sex, age, education, city) and health factors (self-assessed health, public or private healthcare sector use), in victims, perpetrators and both was estimated using adjusted logistic regression odds ratios (AOR, 95 % confidence intervals). Results: <b>Forgone</b> healthcare ranged from 12. 6 % (Budapest) to 22. 4 % (Stuttgart) and was associated with bidirectional involvement in IPV (AOR, 95 %CI= 1. 37, 1. 05 - 1. 78). A lower educational level was associated with <b>forgone</b> care in multivariate models fitted for victims of and for bidirectional involvement in IPV. A fair/poor self-assessed health (contrasting to a good/very good/excellent health) was significantly associated with <b>forgone</b> care in victims (AOR, 95 %CI= 2. 61, 1. 96 - 3. 47), in bidirectional IPV (AOR, 95 %CI= 2. 94, 2. 27 - 3. 82) and for perpetrators (AOR, 95 %CI= 2. 58, 1. 96 - 3. 40). Conclusion: Beside the known barriers identified for inequalities and access to healthcare, the role of IPV in <b>forgone</b> healthcare should be considered...|$|R

40|$|During the Great Recession in America, African-Americans {{opted to}} <b>forgo</b> {{healthcare}} {{more than other}} racial/ethnic groups. It is not understood whether disparities in <b>forgone</b> care returned to pre-recession levels. Understanding healthcare utilization patterns is important for informing subsequent efforts to decrease healthcare disparities. Therefore, we examined changes in racial disparities in <b>forgone</b> care before, during, and after the Great Recession. Data were pooled from the 2006 - 2013 National Health Interview Survey. <b>Forgone</b> medical, mental, and prescription care due to affordability were assessed among African-Americans and Whites. Time periods were classified as: pre-recession (May 2006 -November 2007), early recession (December 2007 -November 2008), late recession (December 2008 -May 2010) and post-recession (June 2010 -December 2013). Multivariable logistic regressions of race, interacted with time periods, were used to identify disparities in <b>forgone</b> care controlling for other demographics, health insurance coverage, and having a usual place for medical care across time periods. Adjusted Wald tests were performed to identify significant changes in disparities across time periods. The sample consisted of 110, 746 adults. African-Americans {{were more likely to}} <b>forgo</b> medical care during the post- recession compared to Whites (OR = 1. 16, CI = 1. 06, 1. 26); changes in foregone medical care disparities were significant in that they increased in the post-recession period compared to the pre-recession (OR = 1. 17, CI = 1. 08, 1. 28 and OR = 0. 89, CI = 0. 77, 1. 04, respectively, adjusted Wald Test p-value < 0. 01). No changes in disparities were seen in prescription and mental <b>forgone</b> care. A persistent increase in <b>forgone</b> medical care disparities existed among African-Americans compared to Whites post-Great Recession and may be a result of outstanding issues related to healthcare access, cost, and quality. While health insurance is an important component of access to care, it alone should not be expected to remove these disparities due to other financial constraints. Additional strategies are necessary to close remaining gaps in care widened by the Great Recession...|$|R
