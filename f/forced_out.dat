50|$|The Official Baseball Rules {{hold that}} if the third out of an inning is a <b>force</b> <b>out</b> of a runner {{advancing}} to any base then, even if another baserunner crosses home plate before that <b>force</b> <b>out</b> is made, his run does not count. But if the third out is not a <b>force</b> <b>out,</b> but a tag out, then if that other baserunner crosses home plate before that tag out is made, his run will count.|$|R
50|$|No run may {{score on}} an inning-ending play {{in which the}} third <b>out</b> is a <b>force</b> <b>out</b> or on the batter before he reaches first base. Put in other words, <b>force</b> <b>outs</b> count before runs are scored. It is common that a runner reaches home plate a moment before the third out is made by <b>force</b> <b>out.</b> Such a case is routine; the runner doesn't score but is counted as left on base.|$|R
50|$|As well as {{his great}} height Ōuchiyama {{was known for his}} strong and {{flexible}} legs, and his speed. His most common winning kimarite were yori kiri (<b>force</b> <b>out),</b> yori taoshi (<b>force</b> <b>out</b> and down), kotenage (armlock throw) and uwatenage (overarm throw).|$|R

5|$|After being <b>forced</b> <b>out</b> of his {{headquarters}} at Nazareth {{on the morning}} of 20 September, Liman von Sanders drove via Tiberias and Samakh late in the afternoon, arriving at Deraa during the morning of 21 September on his way to Damascus.

5|$|Although {{the arms}} of the encirclement had now made contact, the Allies were not yet astride Seventh Army's escape route in any great {{strength}} and their positions came under frenzied assault. During the day an armoured column from the 2nd Panzer Division broke through the Canadians in St. Lambert, capturing half the village and maintaining an open road for six hours until being <b>forced</b> <b>out.</b> Many Germans escaped along this route and numerous small parties infiltrated on foot through to the River Dives during the night.|$|E

The second baseman throws to the first baseman, with the throw {{arriving}} in time to <b>force</b> <b>out</b> the batter (third out). This {{is an example of}} grounding into a 5-4-3 triple play, per standard baseball positions.|$|R
50|$|Homasho was a straightforward, unspectacular yotsu-sumo wrestler, rarely {{employing}} throwing moves. His favourite {{grip on his}} opponent's mawashi was a {{left hand}} outside, right hand inside position, or migi-yotsu.

50|$|Kenkō favoured {{techniques}} involving {{grabbing the}} opponent's mawashi, or yotsu-sumo.

After Hoffman and Jobs discuss NeXT's unclear direction, she realizes that Jobs has designed the computer to entice Apple to buy the company and reinstate him.|$|E
5|$|At 5a.m., Croatian special police {{advanced}} to the Mali Alan pass on the Velebit, encountering strong resistance from the ARSK Lika Corps' 4th Light Brigade and elements of the 9th Motorized Brigade.

In the morning, the special police captured Lovinac, Gračac and Medak.|$|E
5|$|During the Ottoman countercoup of 1909, Quwatli {{strongly}} supported the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) against Abdul Hamid II.

Soon after, the parliament was dissolved, and the liberal Arab politicians were <b>forced</b> <b>out</b> in the following elections.|$|E
50|$|Kushimaumi {{was one of}} the {{heaviest}} wrestlers ever, weighing over 200 kg at his peak, and his great physical strength was demonstrated by his frequent use of the kimedashi (arm barring <b>force</b> <b>out)</b> technique. He also regularly employed yorikiri (the <b>force</b> <b>out)</b> and kotenage (the arm lock throw).|$|R
50|$|It {{is not a}} <b>force</b> <b>out</b> when {{a runner}} is put out while trying to tag up after a caught fly ball. Because this out {{is similar to a}} true <b>force</b> <b>out,</b> in that the runner can be put out by a fielder {{possessing}} the ball at the base that the runner needs to reach, there is a widespread misconception that this <b>out</b> is a <b>force</b> <b>out.</b> But it is not, which means the run would count if it scored before the third out is made on a runner trying to tag up.|$|R
50|$|With {{a runner}} on first base, on a ground {{ball to the}} shortstop or third baseman the second baseman will cover second base to <b>force</b> <b>out</b> the runner coming from first. Moreover, if there are fewer than two outs he will attempt to turn the double play: that is, he will receive the throw from the other player with his foot on second base (to <b>force</b> <b>out</b> the runner coming from first base), and in one motion pivot toward first base and throw the ball there (to <b>force</b> <b>out</b> the batter before he gets there).|$|R
5|$|Gestation lasts six {{to seven}} months. Births {{generally}} occur in the midday; the female will isolate herself from the herd when labour pain begins. The perception that females can delay giving birth for an additional month if conditions are harsh may however not be realistic. A single calf is born, and is immediately concealed in cover {{for the first few}} weeks of its birth. The fawn then joins a nursery group within its mother's herd. Calves are suckled for four to six months; young males, <b>forced</b> <b>out</b> of the group, join bachelor herds, while females may stay back.|$|E
5|$|Greyhound and Speedway racing {{also took}} part in the town, using the Albion Rovers FC ground. Greyhound Racing began on 11 December 1931 and lasted until 1986. The Edinburgh Monarchs rode there in 1968-69 (as the Coatbridge Monarchs) after losing their track at Meadowbank Stadium to the {{developers}} for the 1970 Commonwealth Games. Glasgow Tigers moved from Hampden Park to Coatbridge in 1973, and stayed there until June 1977, when they were <b>forced</b> <b>out</b> by the greyhound racing.|$|E
5|$|Healy was {{selected}} for the 2010 World Twenty20 in the West Indies and played in every match after Fields was again <b>forced</b> <b>out</b> by injury. In the first warm-up match, she took two catches and did not bat as Australia lost to New Zealand by 18 runs. In the last warm-up match, she was again not required to bat and {{did not make a}} dismissal as the Australians defeated Pakistan by 82 runs.|$|E

50|$|Tochinoumi {{was noted}} for his {{technical}} skill, and {{six of his}} seven special prizes were for Technique.
