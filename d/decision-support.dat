2500|$|Ambulances are {{dispatched}} from regional dispatch centres, {{except during}} wars or other emergencies when service is provided {{from a national}} dispatch centre. [...] This centre uses dispatch technologies such as Automatic Vehicle Locating (AVL) and <b>decision-support</b> software that are comparable with U.S. and European systems. [...] The national emergency number for an ambulance in Israel is 101. [...] This number is answered by MDA around the clock.|$|E

2500|$|All 25 EMS {{regions in}} the Netherlands are self-dispatching. [...] Some regions {{have more than one}} centre, but all are interconnected. [...] The {{technologies}} involved in the dispatch of EMS resources are generally equivalent to the American and British standards. [...] All EMS dispatch centers participate in the national emergency number scheme. [...] The emergency telephone number for ambulances in the Netherlands is 112. All EMS calls in the Netherlands are nurse-triaged. Triage is conducted using national evidence-based triage protocols and guidelines developed by the Dutch Ambulance Institute. Most dispatch centers use computer-based <b>decision-support</b> systems. As a result of this approximately 30 percent of all requests for service are dealt with by some other means of service at the scene, and in approximately 40 percent of cases, the call is triaged with a result that an ambulance response is avoided entirely.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the skill}} set {{of those in}} the {{ambulance}} increased, so did the importance of information. [...] Ambulance service moved from 'first come...first served' or giving priority to whoever sounded the most panicked, to {{trying to figure out what}} was actually happening, and the assignment of resources by priority of need. [...] This occurred slowly at first, with local initiatives and full-time ambulance dispatchers making best guesses. [...] Priority codes developed for ambulance dispatch, and became commonplace, although they have never been fully standardized. [...] As it became possible for those in the ambulance to actually save lives, the process of sending the closest appropriate resource to the person in the greatest need became very important. Dispatchers needed tools to help them make the correct decisions, and a number of products initially competed to provide that <b>decision-support.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The next area of {{responsibility}} involves the triage of incoming calls, providing expert systematized caller interrogation, using the script provided by the Emergency Medical Dispatch system, {{in order to determine}} the likely severity of the patient's illness or injury, so that the most appropriate type of response resource may be expedited. [...] All calls are prioritized by medical symptom/condition acuity. [...] This process may be further complicated by panic-stricken callers who scream, cry, or make unreasonable demands. [...] The trained EMD uses interpersonal and crisis management skills to sort through these distractions, taking control of the conversation, calming the caller, and extracting the necessary information. [...] This inquiry begins with the obvious questions regarding whether the patient is conscious or breathing. [...] The questioning will continue until the EMD is able to qualify a potentially life-threatening condition, at which time the closest appropriate response resource (such as a paramedic-staffed ambulance service) is notified to initiate pinpointing the call location. [...] When this occurs, the EMD will continue the questioning, attempting to gather additional relevant information, useful to determine response speed, the type of resources dispathed, or the type of equipment that the paramedics will bring to the site when they arrive. [...] In most cases, this 'pre-alert' function will not be required, and the resource will simply be dispatched when all of the required information has been gathered. [...] Ultimately, the decision on how to proceed, or when to interrupt the established process, requires the judgment of the EMD handling the call. [...] Otherwise, the manner in which this questioning proceeds is often governed by protocols, or by <b>decision-support</b> software.|$|E
