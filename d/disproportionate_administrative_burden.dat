40|$|<b>Administrative</b> <b>burdens</b> {{stemming}} from regulations are a worldwide cause {{of concern for}} policy-makers. Reducing <b>administrative</b> <b>burdens</b> has become an important policy objective in economic growth strategies for many governments. The European Commission set out a policy goal of reducing <b>administrative</b> <b>burdens</b> by 25 % by 2012, although the literature provides limited evidence of its impact. Therefore, this paper examines the impact of <b>administrative</b> <b>burdens</b> on growth by using 6 business regulation variables for a panel of 182 countries. The results from the fixed effect regression analysis suggest that reducing <b>administrative</b> <b>burdens</b> in certain policy areas spurs economic growth. In particular, reducing burdens concerning start-ups and paying taxes enhances growth significantly. Furthermore, using a panel of 26 European countries, our results suggest that reducing the <b>administrative</b> <b>burdens</b> by 25 % has {{a positive effect on}} growth of 1. 62 % in the European Union...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to assess the effect of {{regulatory}} burdens in the European dairy industry on its competitiveness. A theoretical foundation is provided by transaction cost economics and total quality management insights. The effects of legislation on administrative requirements and competitiveness are supposed to be mediated by impacts on innovativeness, company strategy, food safety system availability, as well as the available information & communication capabilities. We will connect to previous research (Wijnands et al., 2007) and the findings therein. Four sub-questions are addressed: • what is the relationship between <b>administrative</b> <b>burdens,</b> innovation and competitiveness? • what is the relationship between <b>administrative</b> <b>burdens,</b> food safety & quality system deployment and competitiveness? • what is the relationship between <b>administrative</b> <b>burdens,</b> food labelling requirements and competitiveness? • what is the relationship between <b>administrative</b> <b>burdens,</b> supply chain transparency and competitiveness? In addition to the theoretical framework presented earlier in Bremmers et al., 2008, this paper contains the first results of a survey in the European dairy industry. They are combined with the proceeds from a literature search. The results show that (Q 1) especially product innovation is negatively impacted by <b>administrative</b> <b>burdens.</b> Food safety and quality systems (Q 2) serve to provide a level playing field in Europe. They would be installed also if no legal requirements would enforce them, because clients ask for it, so that <b>administrative</b> <b>burdens</b> could easily be attributed to business strategy rather than legal obligations. To reduce <b>administrative</b> <b>burdens,</b> we advice to integrate food safety and quality requirements is necessary. It would reduce monitoring and reporting costs, both for private as well as public parties. Food labeling (Q 3) (a ‘made in Europe’ origin marking) could work contraproductive with respect to the competitive position of dairy firms and will have an increase of <b>administrative</b> <b>burdens</b> as a net-effect. And last but not least (Q 4), increased chain transparency (mentioning the name of intermediary producers on the end-product package) will accelerate <b>administrative</b> <b>burdens,</b> but will only be beneficial for SMEs with a differentiated product. Commodity-producers in the dairy industry which only follow a cost strategy will gradually merge and/or disappear. dairy industry, competitiveness, <b>administrative</b> <b>burdens,</b> food safety, labelling, Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R

40|$|The Netherlands {{wants to}} reduce the <b>administrative</b> <b>burden</b> for {{businesses}} between 2003 and 2007 with a quarter. With {{the aid of the}} so called Standard Cost Model, the burden is estimated to amount to 16. 4 billion euro in 2002. This is about 3. 6 % of the Dutch gross domestic product (GDP). However, {{a significant part of the}} <b>administrative</b> <b>burden,</b> over 40 % of the total, is the direct result of international, mainly European legislation. This makes the reduction of the <b>administrative</b> <b>burden</b> a European issue. Besides, a reduction in one member state may affect the economies in other member states. This memorandum considers the direct and indirect effects of reducing the <b>administrative</b> <b>burden</b> on firms. Reducing the burden is expected among other things to boost investment, adding to the increase in production and labour productivity. For an individual country a unilateral reduction probably has different effects than a reduction that is part of a co-ordinated, European effort to scale down the <b>administrative</b> <b>burden</b> of government regulations. To assess the indirect effects, within the economy of the European Union and between European economies, we employ the CPBÂ’s general-equilibrium model WorldScan, which simultaneously takes account of the different product and factor markets in the world economy and which models many European economies in detail. The Netherlands is one of the very few countries, which currently has detailed information on the <b>administrative</b> <b>burden</b> of government regulations. Therefore, we assume that the key figures for the Netherlands also hold for the other member states of the European Union. This assumption implies that for the whole European Union an <b>administrative</b> <b>burden</b> exists of 340 billion euro in 2002. Better data for other member states are needed to arrive at a complete assessment of direct and indirect effects. ...|$|R

Due to the new conventions that are formed by IMO, more requirements are added which often lead to time consuming administrative tasks and documentation that should be spent on activities which are contributing to the ships safety. The issue has been observed by IMO that has through BIMCO done a study with the aim to identify and reduce <b>administrative</b> <b>burdens</b> at sea. The primary aim {{of this study is to}} find out if safety officers aboard Swedish ferries consider that SOLAS Chapter III, 8. 3 och 19. 5 regulations are <b>administrative</b> <b>burdens,</b> restricted to muster lists and documentation of training aboard the ship. The secondary questions to the study are if it is possible to remove, combine or change the documents and how much time can be saved by doing this. The question about timesaving could not be answered, because the values were scattered and could not be used for further investigation. The observed values were accumulated by a survey and the result indicated that safety officers did not experience the two regulations as <b>administrative</b> <b>burdens.</b> Due to this, the majority of the respondents did not have requests about changing or removing the requirements since all safety officers considered them to be important. Other duties that were experienced as <b>administrative</b> <b>burdens</b> were customs lists, handling of certificates and reporting to various authorities...|$|R

40|$|The key {{objective}} of the paper is to identify and assess the <b>administrative</b> <b>burdens</b> for businesses in Bulgaria according to the selected national laws related to the EU Internal Market. The study relies on objective data and analytical frameworks {{with a view to}} identify and assess the information obligations stemming from selected laws and regulations, including national rules implementing or transposing European legislation. This is an important step in strengthening Bulgaria’s national policy on better regulation for businesses. Information obligations are those arising from regulation to provide information and data to the public sector or third parties. <b>Administrative</b> <b>burdens</b> represent the “extra” administrative costs linked to collecting and providing information that businesses would not normally have to do {{in the absence of a}} legal obligation. While regulation is important and necessary, these additional costs represent a burden for businesses. It is a burden for business both in terms of money and time, which diverts resources from productive investments and generally discourages entrepreneurship. The methodology used in the paper is based on the Standard Cost Model for Estimating Administrative Costs established for assessing administrative costs imposed by the EU legislation. The paper is developed taking into account the findings of the OECD and the European Commission. The study outlines the results of the administrative costs and <b>administrative</b> <b>burdens</b> for businesses in Bulgaria of totally measured 742 information obligations (IOs) in 16 national laws and regulations to them in 9 selected priority areas during 2013. Even though the study is limited to specific legal acts and to an assessment of costs to business, the results are helpful in understanding the mechanisms by which the administrative costs and <b>administrative</b> <b>burdens</b> accrue. All IOs identified and verified in the paper, related both to national rules implementing or transposing European legislation, are distinguished by specific laws and by specific priority areas. The data collection methods include interviews with business entities (field work) and expert assessments. The results obtained from the study show that more than half of all IOs examined in the paper are concentrated in three selected national laws – the Medicinal Products in Human Medicine Act, the Law on Statistics and the Law on Technical Requirements for Products and Conformity Assessment. More than half of all IOs are associated with implementation of national requirements related to the EU Internal Market. As concerns the value of the <b>administrative</b> <b>burden,</b> the highest share of <b>administrative</b> <b>burden</b> of all identified and evaluated IOs is observed under the Excise Duties and Tax Warehouses Act and the Law on Support for Farmers. The lowest share of the <b>administrative</b> <b>burden</b> of all IOs is found under those laws where the identified and assessed IOs are only a few (the Law on Social Assistance, the Bulgarian Chamber of Builders Act, the Independent Assessors Act and the Cadastre and Land Registry Act) ...|$|R
