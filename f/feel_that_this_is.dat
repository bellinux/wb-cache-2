25|$|Poverty {{can lead}} to {{increased}} trafficking in many different ways. Poverty affects the notion of individual choice and often drives families to make decisions out of desperation and lack of education. Poverty, in some countries, may influence parents {{to send their children}} to work in another urban country with a more stable economy, such as the U.S., without the knowledge that the child is then forced into slave labor or prostitution. Furthermore, once this kidnapping and trafficking of the child occurs, the victim often accepts their situation and limits efforts to escape their imprisonment. Oftentimes, they wind up alone in a country where they do not speak the language, making it difficult to seek aid. In addition, victims often accept their positions because they <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the only way that they may send some remittances to their family and their enslaved situations may in some cases still be better than their original impoverished and desperate state.|$|E

[...] An enhanced interface {{was created for}} the game to increase usability for new players, {{as well as a}} contextual in-game help system that could aid lost or confused players during their journey. President of The Pokémon Company Tsunekazu Ishiharu noted, [...] "We don't feel that this a remake at all.

Borg himself returned to Wimbledon {{for the first time}} since losing the final in 1981, saying [...] "I just <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the right time for me to come back, to hopefully watch Roger winning his fifth title in a row to match my record."

500|$|In December 2010, Moqadem and Schaar filed {{a lawsuit}} against Lafosse {{demanding}} that they be able to review the film's screenplay. The 4th Civil Chamber of the Court of Brussels ruled that the lawsuit was [...] "admissible but unfounded." [...] However, production had already begun — cast negotiations were finished, and the team had already approached the French government about receiving subsidies — and Lafosse demonstrated no intent to hand over his work. The pair's lawyer subsequently released an official statement: [...] "Moqadem and Schaar <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a violation of their privacy and do not understand why the filmmakers have so little respect for them." ...|$|E

500|$|Bill Lamb of About.com {{gave the}} song {{three and a}} half stars and commented, [...] "It does seem that Britney's bump-and-grind singing style that we first heard 8 years ago on '...Baby One More Time' is still intact, and the 'It's Britney, bitch' {{announcement}} that opens the song implies a significant amount of fire remains. The opening alone bumps the song's rating up by half a star". Roger Friedman of Fox News dubbed the line as [...] "cocky and fun". Eric R. Danton of The Hartford Courant wrote, [...] "The comedy starts right away, when she plays the role of your drunk friend calling at 3 a.m., slurring, 'It's Britney, bitch'". Mike Schiller of PopMatters called the opening line [...] "real value...kind of hilarious" [...] and added that the [...] "inserted “more” syllables in the chorus only add to the <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a genetically engineered sort of dancefloor banger". Popjustice named [...] "Gimme More" [...] the tenth best song of 2007. The StarPhoenix listed it as the second most infectious song of the year.|$|E

Also, I felt the story needed to be told, I <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> going to be an important film." [...] Benjamin Wallfisch, an Emmy and Ivor Novello-nominated composer, composed music for the movie Bhopal: A Prayer for Rain. The film was slated to release in 2010 but the lack of response from the distributors delayed the release. On the 30th anniversary of the Bhopal Gas Disaster, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh attended the film's premiere in Bhopal and after watching the film he announced that the state government would not charge any tax on the film's earning. Chouhan called the film [...] "very sensitive" [...] and praised the [...] "heart-rending" [...] performance given by actors. To promote awareness about the tragedy a NGO The Bhopal Medical Appeal and the film's director collaborated with mobile commerce portal Paytm and the online shopping website Snapdeal. As part of the partnership Paytm and Snapdeal offered their customers a chance to donate money in form of online coupons to the disaster victims.|$|E

The effects of this macrodipole are {{a matter of some}} controversy. α-helices often occur with the N-terminal end bound by a negatively charged group, sometimes an amino acid side chain such as glutamate or aspartate, or sometimes a phosphate ion. Some regard the helix macrodipole as interacting electrostatically with such groups. Others <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> misleading and it is more realistic to say that the hydrogen bond potential of the free NH groups at the N-terminus of an α-helix can be satisfied by hydrogen bonding; this can also be regarded as set of interactions between local microdipoles such as [...]|$|E
2500|$|While {{the game}} was well received, some reviewers were {{disappointed}} {{that there was no}} option to restart a race or event. Instead the player had to either fail the event, or cancel the race by bringing the vehicle to a stop for a few seconds, and then return to the specific place on the map to try that particular race or event again. [...] Criterion responded to this criticism by stating that they don't <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a problem and that adding a [...] "retry" [...] option would introduce loading screens, which they [...] "hate with a passion". Despite this, the option to restart an event was later added to the game via a free software update. EuroGamer found DJ Atomika, the game's guide, to be [...] "instantly dislikeable".|$|E

2500|$|In 2004, Santos took on {{the lead}} role in Joel Lamangan's drama Sabel. Based in part on Joanne Woodward's The Three Faces of Eve, the film, under the {{manuscript}} of Ricky Lee, stars Santos as the titular lead who suffers from Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) formerly known as multiple personality disorder—eventually charged with murder. Gigi Javier-Alfonso of The Philippine Daily Tribune noted, [...] "Santos is superior in her performance in this brave new film [...] quite sympathetic and certainly not painted as villain", whilst Lito B. Zulueta of The Philippine Daily Inquirer remarked [...] "It [...] is absorbing to watch because of its assay at the riddle of sexuality {{as well as the}} performance of Santos". Asked about her significant career milestone, Santos stated [...] " [...] I <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> my transition film because {{this is the first time}} I did a film like this.

2500|$|Heidegger's later works, {{beginning}} by 1930 {{and largely}} {{established by the}} early 1940s, seem to many commentators (e.g. William J. Richardson) to at least reflect a shift of focus, if not indeed {{a major change in}} his philosophical outlook, which is known as [...] "the turn" [...] (die Kehre). One way this has been understood is as a shift from [...] "doing" [...] to [...] "dwelling" [...] (Wohnen) and from Being and Time to Time and Being (This aspect had a particular influence on architectural theorists in their focus on place and space in thinking about dwelling. Such is the case with the work of Christian Norberg-Schulz and the philosopher-architect Nader El-Bizri.) [...] However, others <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> to overstate the difference. For example, in 2011 Mark Wrathall argued that Heidegger pursued and refined the central notion of unconcealment throughout his life as a philosopher. Its importance and continuity in his thinking, Wrathall states, shows {{that he did not have}} a [...] "turn". A reviewer of Wrathall's book stated: [...] "An ontology of unconcealment [...] means a description and analysis of the broad contexts in which entities show up as meaningful to us, as well as the conditions under which such contexts, or worlds, emerge and fade." ...|$|E

The second and third lecture were reworked into a larger text in 1953 with the title Die Frage nach der Technik and in this form published in 1954 in the collection Vorträge und Aufsätze, which also included a slightly reworked version of the first lecture, Das Ding. In 1962, Die Frage nach der Technik and the fourth lecture Die Kehre were published together in a small book called Die Technik und die Kehre, which is still in print.
