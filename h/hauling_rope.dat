5000|$|June 1, 1990: Tbilisi, Georgia. After the <b>hauling</b> <b>rope</b> broke {{inside the}} coupler of the up going cabin, cabin number 1 {{being close to}} the lower station rolled back and slammed {{on the wall of}} the station killing 4 and {{injuring}} many. The cabin number 2 being just about to pass over upper supporting tower subsequently rolled down, generating higher speed due to a failure of the brakes; on reaching the lower support mast, it collided with the broken <b>hauling</b> <b>rope</b> which tore the cabin apart, track cable fell of the mast dangling the cut open gondola near 6 story house colliding with the house, gondola destroyed even more and caused people to fall from a height of 20 meters onto rooftops and ground killing 15 and injuring many. and many injured after jumping from accelerating cabin. Most of them were children celebrating [...] "Children's day". Year before, the cable car went under major reconstruction also standard Soviet gondolas were changed to bigger ones brought from Finland without any precautions.

50|$|The {{funicular}} railway operates by 'hauling' up one carriage using electric motors {{to pull the}} <b>haul</b> <b>rope</b> as the other carriage descends at the same time. The system is powered by two stationary in series 500 kW electric motors, a gear box and a 'soft start-soft stop' control system which can increase the electrical frequency and vary the current and voltage to control the carriage speeds as they approach or leave a station. A hydraulically operated 'counter' rope is connected to both carriages to maintain <b>haul</b> <b>rope</b> tension. The two carriages are permanently connected by the <b>haul</b> <b>rope</b> and the counter rope and can never operate independently.|$|R
50|$|This system {{creates a}} {{circular}} train flow {{where more than}} one train moves in the same direction. The principle of this system is based on several rope loops which adjoin and overlap {{each other in the}} stations. Every <b>haul</b> <b>rope</b> loop is supplied with its own drive and return machinery. In every station each vehicle of the train has to be disconnected from the current <b>haul</b> <b>rope</b> to the next <b>haul</b> <b>rope</b> in order to continue the circular and synchronized train flow. The <b>haul</b> <b>rope</b> loop change may occur only when all the trains are positioned at the standard stop position in the stations and are standstill and will be carried out during boarding/de-boarding of the passengers. Switches installed at the end stations will guide the train from one lane of the double lane track over to a single guideway in the end stations. During the station stop the switch will be repositioned that the train can leave the station at the other lane of the double lane track. For the functionality of the Pinched Loop concept the stations spans have to be approximately equidistant from each other.|$|R
50|$|In this system, {{only one}} {{guideway}} enters each end station, but movable switches direct trains onto dual tracks between stations {{so they can}} pass one another en route. The bypass must be located approximately {{in the middle of}} two terminal end stations, and can form part of an intermediate station. This configuration is comparable to the Double Shuttle system in terms of capacity and frequency (headway). Either each train has its own <b>haul</b> <b>rope</b> or both trains are attached to the same <b>haul</b> <b>rope</b> depending on the application requirements(station configuration, system length, etc.).|$|R

50|$|The modern Tyrolean Zugspitze Cable Car has a {{top station}} {{opposite}} {{the one of}} the German Eibsee Cable Car system. It has a length of 3600 metres and an elevation gain of 1725 metres. The Tyrolean Zugspitze Cable Car runs over three aerial lift pylons. The double track ropes have a diameter of 62 mm each, and the <b>hauling</b> <b>rope</b> has a diameter of 38 mm. It runs on 2 x 500 kilowatts of power, generated in the valley station. The journey normally takes less than 10 minutes at a speed of 36 km/h. The tramway's two cabins can accommodate 100 persons each and have a transport capacity of 730 persons per hour each way.|$|E
50|$|The 1990 Tbilisi {{aerial tramway}} {{accident}} was an aerial tramway accident in Tbilisi, {{the capital of}} Soviet Georgia on June 1, 1990, which resulted in 20 deaths and at least 15 injuries. The accident involved 2 gondolas on a ropeway route between Rustaveli Avenue and Mount Mtatsminda. The red gondola number 1 {{was on its way}} down from the slope of the mountain nearing the lower supporting tower and the red gondola number 2 was nearing an upper tower, when the <b>hauling</b> <b>rope</b> broke inside the coupler of the upper gondola. Both gondolas rolled down simultaneously. The lower gondola slammed into the wall of the lower station injuring people and killing 4. The upper gondola generated a higher speed (the length of ropeway was 863,3 meters); on reaching the lower support tower, it struck the broken <b>hauling</b> <b>rope</b> which was hanging on the tower, causing the cable to tear the gondola apart. The collision was so strong that the track cable fell off the tower, dangling the cut open gondola above the rooftops. This also caused the cabin to slide further down, striking the rooftop of a six-story building. This caused even further destruction to the gondola and caused people to fall 20 meters onto the rooftops and ground below. Overall, 20 people were killed and at least 15 badly injured. Most of them were children on a sightseeing tour in Tbilisi from regional town Akhaltsikhe school number 5.Children's Day. Witnesses in both gondolas who survived say that brakes did not work in either of the gondolas despite the desperate attempts from guides and passengers who helped them to pull the brakes.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To {{estimate}} {{influence of}} elastic deformations {{of the track}} cable arising at movement of cars, on effort in a <b>hauling</b> <b>rope</b> of the aerial ropeway. Methodology. The method of consecutive approaches was used for research influence of elastic deformations of a track cable on effort in a <b>hauling</b> <b>rope.</b> Thus, definition of a tension of a track cable was carried out with use of the technique based on principles of modular configuration, the essence of which consists in formation of mathematical model {{by a combination of}} blocks of the formulas describing balance of the track cable on supports. Findings. The research has shown that influence of elastic deformations of a track cable on effort in a <b>hauling</b> <b>rope</b> was insignificant (less than 1 %). That points to possibility not to consider change of the track cable length, caused by its elastic properties, when modeling loading of elements of system «drive – traction rope – tension device». Also it has been found that use of the tension device of a track cable increased influence of its elastic properties on loading of rope system elements. At the same time the elastic component of the track cable tension in the test flight does not depend on a car position in the adjacent span, but only determines by the parameters of the rope system. Originality. The possibility of excluding the changes of track cable length caused by its elastic properties, when modeling loading of elements of system «drive – traction rope – tension device» was proved. Practical value. The use of these techniques and the results will simplify the mathematical model of loading of elements of the cable system and the system «drive – traction rope – tension device» as a whole...|$|E
50|$|A Funifor {{is a type}} of {{aerial lift}} or aerial tramway with two guide <b>ropes</b> and a <b>haul</b> <b>rope</b> loop per cabin.The Funifor design is {{patented}} by Doppelmayr Garaventa Group.Two reversible cabins run on parallel tracks. The drives of the two cabins are not interconnected.At the top of each track, the <b>haul</b> <b>rope</b> forthat track loops back to the bottom instead of looping over to serve the other track as occurs with a normalaerial tramway. This feature allows for single cabin operation when traffic warrants. The independent drive alsoallows for evacuations to occur by means of a bridge connected between the two adjacent cabins.|$|R
50|$|Initially, the tramway {{consisted}} of two sections with two cars each. The cabins travelled from the terminal stations to Torre Jaume I and back, with one <b>haul</b> <b>rope</b> for the total length to move all four cabins.|$|R
50|$|The company only built fixed-grip lifts, whose chair grip is {{woven into}} the <b>haul</b> <b>rope</b> rather than clamped onto it. But other {{technologies}} eventually proved more popular. In early 2003, the firm {{announced that it was}} no longer viable and would go out of business.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was on this}} {{expedition}} that Pete Schoening performed {{what has}} come to be known simply as [...] "The Belay," [...] saving the lives of six of the team from falling several thousand feet to their death. One of the expedition members, Art Gilkey, had developed thrombophlebitis (blod clots) in his legs and was unable to walk. In an attempt to save their companion, the team abandoned the summit attempt and started a hazardous descent from 25,500 feet in blizzard conditions. At about 24,000 feet, Schoening was belaying Gilkey down an ice slope. Four of the other team members had a double <b>haul</b> <b>rope</b> attached to Gilkey and were pulling him across the slope toward a ledge as Schoening lowered him. A fifth team member, George Bell, started down the ice slope to join the four haulers. On the descent, Bell slipped on the ice and began falling. As he passed the four on the <b>haul</b> <b>ropes,</b> he pulled Tony Streather, who was roped to Bell, off his feet. Their rope tangled with the <b>haul</b> <b>ropes,</b> which pulled Bob Bates, Dee Molenaar, and Charlie Houston off their feet. All five fell the length of their ropes when their combined weight hit Schoening and his belay. Schoening was able to hold the belay, arresting the massive fall before his team members went over the edge of a cliff.|$|R
50|$|In {{technical}} terms, the Norsjö {{aerial tramway}} is a bi-cable gondola lift with detachable cabins suspended from a track rope and moved by a <b>haul</b> <b>rope.</b> The cabins can each carry four {{people at a}} speed of 10 km/hour, taking 1h 45mins to ride one way. 3 km of the ride is above lakes and streams.|$|R
50|$|The {{use of a}} {{detachable}} chairlift reduces maintenance {{needed to}} clear the <b>haul</b> <b>rope.</b> When bad weather is expected, the chairs are removed and stored in the lower lift house. The rope runs at low speed to prevent the buildup of snow and ice. The chairs are redeployed in an automatic operation which takes about 30 minutes.|$|R
5000|$|The tram has two 60-passenger cabins, {{capable of}} a maximum uphill {{capacity}} of 1050 people per hour. Maximum speed is 2000 feet per minute or 10.2 meters per second. This type of tram {{is known as a}} double-reversible or [...] "jig-back". Both cabins are coupled to a common <b>haul</b> <b>rope</b> and they move in unison, one up and one down.|$|R
50|$|Poma's {{first model}} was the Pomalift, a surface lift with a disk that skiers sit on. It {{has the ability}} to travel at high speeds because the platters are {{detachable}} from the <b>haul</b> <b>rope,</b> and because the perch is telescopic and has a pneumatic system which allows for a smooth and progressive departure. They are still sold today along with T-Bars and fixed grip platters.|$|R
60|$|There {{were some}} twenty men running hither and thither about the deck, pulling and <b>hauling</b> on <b>ropes.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{detachable}} chairlift or high-speed chairlift {{is a type}} of passenger aerial lift, which, like a fixed-grip chairlift, {{consists of}} numerous chairs attached to a constantly moving wire <b>rope</b> (called a <b>haul</b> <b>rope)</b> that is strung between two (or more) terminals over intermediate towers. They are now commonplace at all but the smallest of ski resorts. Some are installed at tourist attractions as well as for urban transportation.|$|R
50|$|The <b>haul</b> <b>rope</b> is 7,875 feet (2400m) of 35mm {{solid core}} cable. The cable has a {{breaking}} strength of 172,230 lb. The haul cable operates at 30,050 lb (15 tons) tension per side. The cabins ride on 2 each 50 mm double locking coil track ropes. Each cable is 3526 ft (1075 m) long with a breaking strength of 616,700 lbs. All cables were manufactured by Fatzer of Switzerland.|$|R
50|$|The tramway {{was built}} by Bleichert on the Bleichert-Zuegg system with track ropes of 45 mm and a <b>haul</b> <b>rope</b> of 23 mm. There was also an {{auxiliary}} rope of 17 mm for a small open service vehicle, {{which could be used}} to evacuate the cabins. The cable speed is 3 m/s, driven by an electric motor in Miramar station, with tension weights in the Torre Sant Sebastià.|$|R
50|$|The Double Shuttle system {{configuration}} {{is designed for}} system lengths up to 3 km (1.8 mi) with several stations. It allows higher passenger capacity and higher frequency (shorter headway).In this configuration, two trains run {{side by side on}} a double guideway track, each with its own <b>haul</b> <b>rope</b> and drive machinery. The two trains operate independently. This ensures high system reliability because even if one single shuttle system fails, the other system continues to operate.|$|R
