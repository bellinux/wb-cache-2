40|$|The first {{lipophilic}} substance {{developed as a}} clinical radiopharmaceutical for penetrating the intact human blood-brain barrier was [â€˜ 231 J-iodoantipyrine(1, 2).

40|$|This {{literature}} review presents treatment options for nitrate, iodine- 129, and uranium, which {{are present in}} groundwater at the 200 -ZP-I Groundwater Operable Unit (OU) within the 200 West Area of the Hanford Site. The objective of this review is to determine available methods to treat or sequester these contaminants in place (i. e., in situ) or to pump-and-treat the groundwater aboveground (i. e., ex situ). This review has been conducted with emphasis on commercially available or field-tested technologies, but theoretical studies have, in some cases, been considered when no published field data exist. The initial scope of this {{literature review}} included only nitrate and <b>iodine-I</b> 29, but it was later expanded to include uranium. The focus of the literature review was weighted toward researching methods for treatment of nitrate and iodine- 129 over uranium because of the relatively greater impact of those compounds identified at the 200 -ZP-I OU...|$|E
40|$|<b>Iodine-I</b> 23 {{has almost}} ideal radionuclidic {{properties}} for in vivo diagnostic procedures. It decays solely by electron capture with a I 3. 3 -hr half-life, giving an 83 % abundant I 59 -keV gamma photon, which {{is suitable for}} imaging with scintillation camera systems. When used in patients with normal renal function, o [1 - 1231 iodohippurate[OIH(l-l 23) ] resultsinonlyone-fifthof the radiation dose delivered by OIH(l-l 31) (1, 2). This dose re duction is particularly important in sequential studies and in tests on patients with abnormal renal function. An important index of renal function is the effective renal plasma flow (ERPF), routinely measured by the clearance of para-aminohippurate (PAH) (3). New agents for the measure ment of ERPF should compare favorably with standard values for PAH clearance and extraction ratio. OIH(I- 131) can substitute for PAH, but its radiations restrict the permissibledose,and poor counting statistics result. Becauseof improveddecay character istics, OIH(l- 123) should be better. The potential clinical use fulness of(l-l 23) has been described (1, 2. 4 â€” 9), but no data have been presented that rigorously compare this compound with (I-I 3 1) and PAH. The present paper provides such a physiologic comparison...|$|E
40|$|Purified peanut lectin (peanut agglutinin, PNA) {{labelled}} with {{fluorescein isothiocyanate}} (FITC-PNA) or <b>iodine-I</b> 25 (1251 -PNA) bound to Rhizobium B. TG- 3 and Rhizobium 5 a, which nodulate peanut, {{but did not}} bind to R. japonicum or R. meliloti, which do not nodulate peanut, or to the non-nitrogen-fixing bacteria Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. Washing the rhizobia in phosphate-buffered saline markedly decreased PNA binding. The decrease in binding could be correlated with removal of exopolysaccharides during washing. Dialysed culture filtrate could be labelIed with 12 ”I-PNA and the radioactivity was recovered in an acetone-precipitable exopolysaccharide fraction, showing that the lectin complexed with exopolysaccharides. Residual binding which remained after washing could not be removed by further washing. Moreover, rhizobia could be labelled with 1251 -PNA after removal of exopolysaccharides and the radioactivity was recovered by extraction with hot phenol, indicating that the lectin complexed also with lipopolysaccharide on the bacterial cell wall. Rhizobial lipopolysaccharide not only inhibited haemagglutination by PNA but also dispersed preagglutinated human erythrocytes into free cell suspensions. The results demonstrate the presence of dual binding sites for PNA on rhizobia. Exopolysaccharides are the major sites and the remainder are lipopolysaccharides...|$|E
40|$|Gamma-emitting radiopharmaceuticals {{excreted}} {{primarily through}} the biliary tract are potentially useful for assessment of hepatobiiary function {{and for the}} scintigraphic diagnosis of acute cholecystitis and dilatation or obstruction of the biliary tract. Scintigraphy avoids one of the disadvantages of in travenous cholangiography (i. e., {{the high incidence of}} reactions to the contrast material) and may allow improved visualization of the biliary system com pared with intravenous cholangiography when the serum bilirubin is mildly elevated. <b>Iodine-i</b> 31 -rose bengal was the first agent used for hepatobiliary studies (1, 2). Iodine-labeled brom sulphthalein (3), indocyanine green (4), and asialo ai-glycoprotein (5) have also been proposed. The physical characteristics of the nuclide 181 !,however, are not optimal for imaging. Rose bengal is quickly excreted through the biliary tract and small bowel, but the long residence time in the large-bowel con tents and the beta emissions of 131 Jresult in a rela tively high radiation dose to the bowel mucosa. Con sequently the administered dose of this agent is restricted to 100 â€” 200 @ thereby limiting the reso lution of the images of the biliary tract. Iodine- 123 -rose bengal overcomes this limitation, but is expen sive and, because of its physical half-life of 13 hr, not practical for unscheduled emergency examina tions (6). A O 9 mTciabeled agent would be preferable, be cause of the excellent physical characteristics of BOmTcfor imaging and the availability o...|$|E
40|$|Alternative {{counting}} {{methods for}} the Abbott “Aus-R 1 A ” hepatitis-associated antigen test have been de-vised and evaluated. These methods involve solubili-zation of the tube-bound radiolabeled complex with glacial acetic acid, {{transfer of the}} eluate to a count-ing vial of choice, and measurement by either a gamma scintillation or a liquid scintillation system. These methods, {{when compared to the}} direct count-ing of the AusRIA tube for sera from more than 250 patients and controls, gave a correlation coefficient of 0. 94 to 0. 99. iodine- 125 counting efficiencies av-eraged 65 % both for direct counting of the AusRIA tube and for gamma counting of the eluate. By liquid scintillation counting, <b>iodine-i</b> 25 counting efficiency averaged 50 %. This method avoids high background, chemiluminescence, and quench, and is easy to per-form. By using glacial acetic acid to solubilize the la-beled material, the eluate can be counted by various types of gamma counters as well as by liquid scintil-lation systems. Additional Keyphrase: “kit ” method The widespread use of radioimmunoassay for hep-atitis-associated antigen (HB Ag) has generated in-terest in alternative methods for measuring the ra-diation of samples that are radiolabeled with 125 !. Not all clinical laboratories are equipped to measure the sample directly in the antibody-coated test tubes provided with the AusRIA test (Abbott Labs, North Chicago, Ill. 60064), for example, if only liquid scin-tillation systems are available. One alternative has been described (1), in which the bottom 1. 5 cm of the AusRia tube is cut off and placed in a liquid scintillation solution for counting. However, this still limits the geometry of the final sample container and could present a potential health and contamination hazard...|$|E
