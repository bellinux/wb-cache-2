40|$|This {{investigation}} {{focuses on}} a global <b>forcing</b> <b>mechanism</b> for decadal regime shifts and their subsequent impacts. The proposed global <b>forcing</b> <b>mechanism</b> is that the global atmospheric planetary waves can lead {{to changes in the}} global surface air–sea conditions and subsequently fishery changes. In this study, the five decadal regime shifts (1956 – 1957, 1964 – 1965, 1977 – 1978, 1988 – 1989, and 1998 – 1999) in the most recent 59 -year period (1950 – 2008) have been identified based on Student t tests and their association with global marine ecosystem change has been discussed. Changes in the three major oceanic (Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian) ecosystems will be explored with the goal of demonstrating the linkage between stratospheric planetary waves and the ocean surface forcing that leads to fisheries impacts. The global <b>forcing</b> <b>mechanism</b> is described with a top-down approach to help the multidisciplinary audience follow the analysis. Following previous work, this analysis addresses how changes in the atmospheric planetary waves may influence the vertical wind structure, surface wind stress, and their connection with the global ocean ecosystems based on a coupling of the atmospheric regime shifts with the decadal regime shifts determined from marine life changes. The multiple decadal regime shifts related to changes in marine life are discussed using the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) global fish capture data (catch/stock). Analyses are performed to demonstrate that examining the interactions between the atmosphere, ocean, and fisheries is a plausible approach to explaining decadal climate change in the global marine ecosystems and its impacts. The results show a consistent mechanism, ocean wind stress, responsible for marine shifts in the three major ocean basins. Changes in the planetary wave pattern affect the ocean wind stress patterns. A change in the ocean surface wind pattern from longwave (relatively smooth and less complex) to shorter-wave (more convoluted and more complex) ocean surface wind stress creates changes in global marine fisheries...|$|E

Specific feature in manufacturing glass balls for micro-optics in accordance with technological process for obtaining ball-shaped workpieces is grinding and polishing of spherical surface in a free state. In this case component billets of future balls {{are made in the}} form of cubes and the billets are given preliminary a form of ball with the help of rough grinding. An advanced method for obtaining ball-shaped work-pieces from brittle materials is a pneumocentrifugal machining. This method presupposes an application of two conic rings with abrasive working surfaces which are set coaxially with large diameters to each other and the billets are rolled along these rings. Rotation of the billets is conveyed by means of pressure medium. The present devices for pneumo-centrifugal machining are suitable for obtaining balls up to 6 mm. Machining of the work-pieces with full spherical surfaces and large diameter is non-productive due to impossibility to ensure a sufficient force on the billet in the working zone. For this reason the paper proposes a modified device where an additional force on the machined billet is created by upper working disc that is making a reciprocating motion along an axis of abrasive conic rings. The motion is realized {{with the help of a}} cylindrical camshaft mechanism in the form of a ring with a profile working end face and the purpose of present paper is to optimize parameters of the proposed device.

40|$|The {{climate system}} {{is capable of}} {{changing}} abruptly from one stable mode to another(1 - 3). Rapid climate oscillations [...] in particular the Younger Dryas cold period during the last deglaciation [...] have long been recognized from records throughout the North Atlantic region(4 - 14), {{and the distribution of}} these records at mostly high latitudes suggests that the changes were caused by rapid reorganizations of the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation(6, 8, 10, 15). But events far from the North Atlantic region that are synchronous with the Younger Dryas(16 - 19) raise the possibility that a more global <b>forcing</b> <b>mechanism</b> was responsible(20). Here we present high-resolution records of laminated sediments of the last deglaciation from the Cariaco basin (tropical Atlantic Ocean) which show many abrupt sub-decade to century-scale oscillations in surface-ocean biological productivity that are synchronous with climate changes at high latitudes. We attribute these productivity variations to changes in or duration of upwelling rate (and hence nutrient supply) caused by changes in trade-wind strength, which is in turn influenced by the thermohaline circulation through its effect on sea surface tempersture(6, 21). Abrupt climate changes in the tropical Atlantic during the last deglaciation are thus consistent with a North Atlantic circulation <b>forcing</b> <b>mechanism...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{driving force}} behind centennial and millennial-scale periodicities in Greenland ice cores and North Atlantic sediments is open to debate. Comparable periodicities {{have been found in}} {{northwest}} European peat bogs but similar studies elsewhere are sparse. Here it is argued that the detection of comparable centennial and millennial-scale periodicities in a New Zealand peat humification profile suggests that the same <b>forcing</b> <b>mechanism</b> has been dominant during much of the Holocene. A number of mechanisms exist that might induce such periodicities in climate: changes in ocean circulation; inherent noise within the climate system; long-term tidal-cycles; variability in volcanic aerosol loading of the atmosphere and variation in solar irradiance. The latter is proposed as the prominent Holocene <b>forcing</b> <b>mechanism</b> and strength is given to this hypothesis by detection of coherent climatic shifts between two New Zealand peat bogs and bogs throughout Europe. Similarly, high-resolution pollen analysis provides evidence of a vegetation response coinciding with shifts to inferred wetter bog conditions in humification data at around 2800 cal. yrs BP and 4400 cal. yrs BP; two prominent episodes of increased bog surface wetness in northwest Europe. The recognition of the possible global dominance of solar forcing during the Holocene has important significance for the prediction of fiiture climate. Faculty of Scienc...|$|E
40|$|The ideal invariants {{present in}} the {{formalism}} of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), i. e. global quantities that are conserved {{in the absence of}} sources and dissipative effects, {{play an important role in}} various theoretical and numerical studies of MHD turbulence. The fluxes of these ideal invariants represent separate channels that transfer the information across different scales in a turbulent system. Once a statistically stationary state of turbulence is reached, the amount of any ideal invariant quantity introduced in the system by a <b>forcing</b> <b>mechanism</b> equals the amount of the same quantity removed by the dissipative effects from the system. For highly developed turbulence, these two mechanisms act predominantly at different scales that are largely separated. Since the ideal invariant quantities cascade between scales, a constant flux is generated with great implication on the state of the system. Numerically, controlling the ideal invariant fluxes levels for a turbulent MHD system is important for the analysis of fundamental MHD turbulence properties. We propose a <b>forcing</b> <b>mechanism</b> that controls the three ideal invariants of MHD turbulence: the total energy, the cross-helicity and the magnetic helicity.

40|$|Abstract—Compliant {{mechanisms}} realize mechanism functions by {{utilizing the}} elastic deformations of flexible components {{rather than the}} relative motions of rigid joints. The advantages of compliant mechanisms stem from the removal or replacement of rigid joints, which include the elimination of backlash, friction, wear and lubrication, the reduction of vibration and noise, the decreased manufacturing and assembly cost, and the increased precision. Because of the integrated motion and force behavior and the nonlinearities of large deformations, designing compliant mechanisms is much more challenging than rigid <b>mechanisms.</b> Constant <b>force</b> compliant <b>mechanisms</b> produce an output force that does not change for a large range of input motion and have many different applications. A method is introduced in this paper for designing constant <b>force</b> compliant <b>mechanisms.</b> A designed constant <b>force</b> compliant <b>mechanism</b> is modelled as a network of variable width spline curves which are defined by their interpolation circles.
