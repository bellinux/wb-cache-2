5|$|In {{people with}} AD, the {{increasing}} impairment {{of learning and}} memory eventually leads to a definitive diagnosis. In a small percentage, difficulties with language, executive functions, perception (agnosia), or execution of movements (apraxia) are more prominent than memory problems. AD does not affect all memory capacities equally. Older memories of the person's life (episodic memory), facts learned (semantic memory), and <b>implicit</b> <b>memory</b> (the memory of the body {{on how to do}} things, such as using a fork to eat or how to drink from a glass) are affected to a lesser degree than new facts or memories.|$|E
25|$|<b>Implicit</b> <b>memory</b> is the non-declarative, or unspoken, {{aspects of}} memory. Priming, motor memory and {{classical}} conditioning are all examples of <b>implicit</b> <b>memory.</b> An example of implicit memory's {{effect on our}} social interactions has been illustrated by the pin-in-hand phenomenon. This phenomenon was first observed by Claparède while dealing with an amnesiac patient. Normally, he would shake the patient's hand and introduce himself, as the patient thought it was their first time meeting. However, on one occasion he hid a pin and pricked the patient with it when she reached to shake his hand. Later, when he offered his hand, she drew away and refused to shake, {{in spite of the}} fact she could not explicitly recall the pinprick itself. The patient was unable to provide a reason for her hesitation.|$|E
25|$|Non-declarative {{memory is}} memory gained from {{previous}} experiences that is unconsciously applied to everyday scenarios. Non-declarative memory {{is essential for}} the performance of learned skills and habits, for example, running or cooking a favourite meal. There are three types of non-declarative memories: <b>implicit</b> <b>memory</b> (unconscious memory, priming), instrumental memory (classical conditioning), and procedural memory (automatic skill memory).|$|E
40|$|Human {{memories}} are expressed either {{with or without}} consciousness, termed as explicit and <b>implicit</b> <b>memories,</b> respectively.

In order to determine whether explicit and <b>implicit</b> relational <b>memories</b> dissociated in a similar way as explicit and <b>implicit</b> item <b>memories,</b> the levels of processing and divided attention were manipulated in the present study and participants 2 ̆ 7 relational memories were tested either directly or indirectly while their eye movements were recorded simultaneously as an index of <b>implicit</b> relational <b>memory</b> suggested by previous studies. It was predicted that dissociations would be observed between explicit and <b>implicit</b> relational <b>memories</b> only if <b>implicit</b> relational <b>memory</b> behaved like <b>implicit</b> item <b>memory.</b> However, several pilot studies showed that there was no memory effect in the <b>implicit</b> relational <b>memory.</b> Therefore, the eye tracking experiments were modified and the effects of levels of processing and divided attention manipulations on human eye movements in direct relational memory tests were examined. Participants 2 ̆ 7 eye movements were affected by the levels of processing manipulation, although there was no main effect of the divided attention manipulation. Therefore, the different eye movements may be associated with the levels of processing specifically rather than levels of performance in general...|$|R

25|$|Childhood amnesia (also {{known as}} {{infantile}} amnesia) {{is the common}} inability to remember events from one's own childhood. Sigmund Freud notoriously attributed this to sexual repression, while modern scientific approaches generally attribute it to aspects of brain development or developmental psychology, including language development, which may be why people do not easily remember pre-language events. Researchers have found that implicit memories cannot be recalled or described. Remembering {{how to play the}} piano is a common example of <b>implicit</b> <b>memory,</b> as is walking, speaking and other everyday activities that would be difficult to focus on if they had to be relearned every time one got up in the morning. Explicit memories, on the other hand, can be recalled and described in words. Remembering the first time meeting a teacher is an example of explicit memories.|$|E
25|$|Semantic {{memory is}} one of the two types of {{declarative}} or explicit memory (our memory of facts or events that is explicitly stored and retrieved). Semantic memory refers to general world knowledge that we have accumulated throughout our lives. This general knowledge (facts, ideas, meaning and concepts) is intertwined in experience and dependent on culture. Semantic memory is distinct from episodic memory, which is our memory of experiences and specific events that occur during our lives, from which we can recreate at any given point. For instance, semantic memory might contain information about what a cat is, whereas episodic memory might contain a specific memory of petting a particular cat. We can learn about new concepts by applying our knowledge learned from things in the past. The counterpart to declarative or explicit memory is nondeclarative memory or <b>implicit</b> <b>memory.</b>|$|E
25|$|Explicit, unlike <b>implicit</b> <b>memory</b> for odors, {{is thought}} {{by some to}} be a {{phenomenon}} that is exclusive to humans. Explicit memory refers to memories that are remembered with conscious awareness of doing so. In olfaction, explicit memory refers to attributing associative meaning to odors. Through the assignment of associations to odors as well as non-odor stimuli, olfactory stimuli can gain meaning. Explicit memories of odors include information which can be used to process and compare other encountered odors. Attention focused on odors aids in the functioning of everyday life as well as the engagement of proper responses to experienced events. Evidence of explicit olfaction memory is seen through behaviours in tasks involving a working memory component. The two most commonly used tests for explicit odor memory are odor identification and odor recognition, which are discussed in greater detail below.|$|E
50|$|The {{multiple}} {{memory system}} theory ascribes {{the differences in}} <b>implicit</b> and explicit <b>memory</b> to {{the differences in the}} underlying structures. The theory says that explicit memories are associated with a declarative memory system responsible for the formation of new representations or data structures. In contrast, <b>implicit</b> <b>memories</b> are associated with a procedural memory system where memories are just modifications of existing procedures or processing operations.|$|R
50|$|REM {{sleep and}} slow-wave sleep play {{different}} roles in memory consolidation. REM {{is associated with}} the consolidation of nondeclarative (<b>implicit)</b> <b>memories.</b> An example of a nondeclarative memory would be a task that we can do without consciously thinking about it, such as riding a bike. Slow-wave, or non-REM (NREM) sleep, {{is associated with the}} consolidation of declarative (explicit) memories. These are facts that need to be consciously remembered, such as dates for a history class.|$|R

The study consisted of an experiment, which looked at the effects on explicit <b>memory</b> compared to <b>implicit</b> and veridical <b>memory.</b> The results of their study showed that articulatory suppression, during encoding information, eliminated <b>implicit</b> false <b>memory</b> and heightened explicit false memory.|$|R
2500|$|Implicit {{memories}} of stimuli {{do not require}} conscious recollection of the initial encounter of the stimulus. In regards to olfactory memory, deliberate recollection of an odor experience is not necessary in order for implicit {{memories of}} odors to form in the brain. [...] Techniques used to study implicit olfactory memory {{are considered to be}} applicable to both humans and animals. [...] In tests of <b>implicit</b> <b>memory,</b> memory of a stimulus is shown to be aided by previous exposure to that same stimulus. [...] Evidence of the formation of <b>implicit</b> <b>memory</b> is found in tests of habituation, sensitization, perceptual learning and classical conditioning. [...] In olfaction there exists a strong tendency for habituation, which is discussed further in the following paragraph. [...] By evaluating memory performance of tasks involving one of these ‘subsets’ of <b>implicit</b> <b>memory,</b> the effect of previous odor stimulus experience not involving conscious recollection can be measured. Further knowledge can be gained about <b>implicit</b> <b>memory</b> of odor through the study of the implications of cognitive deficits. The effects of brain injury on odor memory can be investigated through the use of these <b>implicit</b> <b>memory</b> measures leading to further overall understanding of the brain.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Implicit</b> <b>memory</b> tests, in {{contrast}} with explicit memory tests, measure the recall value of a particular stimulus based on later performance on stimulus-related tasks. During these tasks, the subject does not explicitly recall the stimulus, but the previous stimulus still affects performance. [...] For example, in a word-completion <b>implicit</b> <b>memory</b> task, if a subject reads a list containing the word [...] "dog", the subject provides this word more readily when asked for three-letter words beginning in [...] "d". The levels-of-processing effect is only found for explicit memory tests. One study found that word completion tasks were unaffected by levels of semantic encodings achieved using three words with various levels of meaning in common. Another found that typical level-of-processing effects are reversed in word completion tasks; subjects recalled pictures pairs more completely if they were shown a word representing a picture rather than asked to rate a picture for pleasantness (semantic encoding). [...] Typical level-of-processing theory would predict that picture encodings would create deeper processing than lexical encoding.|$|E
2500|$|Semantic and {{episodic memory}} {{together}} {{make up the}} category of declarative memory, {{which is one of}} the two major divisions of memory – the other is <b>implicit</b> <b>memory.</b> The term [...] "episodic memory" [...] was coined by Endel Tulving in 1972. He was referring to the distinction between knowing and remembering. Knowing is more factual (semantic) whereas remembering is a feeling that is located in the past (episodic).|$|E

2500|$|A {{stimulus}} {{will have}} a higher recall value if it is highly compatible with preexisting semantic structures (Craik, 1972). According to semantic network theories, this is because such a stimulus will have many connections to other encoded memories, which are activated based on closeness in semantic network structure. [...] This activation increases cognitive analysis, increasing {{the strength of the}} memory representation. The familiarity modifier has been tested in <b>implicit</b> <b>memory</b> experiments, where subjects report false memories when presented with related stimuli.|$|E
2500|$|Auditory stimuli follow {{conventional}} levels-of-processing rules, although are somewhat weaker in general recall value {{when compared with}} vision. Some studies suggest that auditory weakness is only present for explicit memory (direct recall), rather than <b>implicit</b> <b>memory.</b> [...] When test subjects are presented with auditory versus visual word cues, they only perform worse on directed recall of a spoken word versus a seen word, and perform about equally on implicit free-association tests. Within auditory stimuli, semantic analysis produces {{the highest levels of}} recall ability for stimuli. Experiments suggest that levels-of-processing on the auditory level is directly correlated with neural activation.|$|E
2500|$|As is {{the case}} the more {{generalized}} forms of social anxiety, intergroup anxiety has behavioral, cognitive, and affective effects.

Indeed, such is consistent with related work on attentional bias in <b>implicit</b> <b>memory.</b> Additionally recent {{research has found that}} implicit racial evaluations (i.e. automatic prejudiced attitudes) can be amplified during intergroup interaction. Negative experiences have been illustrated in producing not only negative expectations, but also avoidant, or [...] antagonistic, behavior such as hostility. Furthermore, when compared to anxiety levels and cognitive effort (e.g., impression management and self-presentation) in intragroup contexts, levels and depletion of resources may be exacerbated in the intergroup situation.|$|E

40|$|The {{psychological}} {{basis of}} odor quality is poorly understood. For pragmatic reasons, descriptions of odor quality generally rely on profiling odors {{in terms of}} what odorants they bring to mind. It is argued here that this reliance on profiling reflects a basic property of odor perception, namely that odor quality depends on the <b>implicit</b> <b>memories</b> that an odorant elicits. This is supported by evidence indicating that odor quality as well as one's ability to discriminate odors is affected by experience. Developmental studies and cross-cultural research also point to this conclusion. In this article, these findings are reviewed and a model that attempts to account for them is proposed.

2500|$|Schizophrenia is {{commonly}} {{described as a}} mental disorder {{in which a person}} becomes detached from reality because of disruptions in the pattern of thinking and perception. [...] Although the etiology is not completely understood, it is closely related to dopaminergic activity and is strongly associated with both neurocognitive and genetic elements of executive dysfunction. Individuals with schizophrenia may demonstrate amnesia for portions of their episodic memory. [...] Observed damage to explicit, consciously accessed, memory is generally attributed to the fragmented thoughts that characterize the disorder. These fragmented thoughts are suggested to produce a similarly fragmented organization in memory during encoding and storage, making retrieval more difficult. However, <b>implicit</b> <b>memory</b> is generally preserved in patients with schizophrenia.|$|E
2500|$|The second main type {{of memory}} is <b>implicit</b> <b>memory</b> or {{unconscious}} memory, {{which refers to}} the changes in performance or behavior that are produced by previous experiences but without any conscious recollection of those experiences.

[...] The following scenario is an example. [...] Patients were exposed during anesthesia to a list of words containing the word [...] "pension". Postoperatively, when they were presented with the three-letter word stem PEN___ and were asked to supply the first word that came to their minds beginning with those letters, they gave the word [...] "pension" [...] more often than [...] "pencil" [...] or [...] "peninsula" [...] or others.|$|E
2500|$|Faces are an {{important}} part of one's social life. [...] To be able to recognize, respond and act towards a person requires unconscious memory encoding and retrieval processes. Facial stimuli are processed in the fusiform gyrus (occipito-temporal brain area) and this processing is an implicit function representing a typical form of <b>implicit</b> <b>memory.</b> REM sleep has been seen to be more beneficial to implicit visuospatial memory processes, rather than slow-wave sleep which is crucial for explicit memory consolidation. REM sleep is known for its visual experiences, which may often include detailed depictions of the human countenance. [...] A recognition task was used to gauge familiarity with a previously shown sequence of faces after a subsequent period of REM sleep. It was seen that the fusiform gyrus was active during training, the REM sleep period, and the recognition task as well. It is hypothesized that brain mechanisms during REM sleep, as well as pure repetition priming, can account for the implicit recognition of the previously shown faces.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Extensive {{evidence}} documents arousal modulation of {{declarative memory}} in humans. However, {{little is known}} about the arousal modulation of <b>implicit</b> motor <b>memory.</b> The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a post-acquisition acute exercise stress on <b>implicit</b> motor <b>memory</b> consolidation. Materials and Methods: Forty healthy subjects were randomly divided into stress (10 men and 10 woman) and non- stress (10 men and 10 woman) groups. Experiment consisted of two phases of acquisition and retention. Serial Color matching (SCM) task was used for this study. In acquisition period, all groups practiced the task for six blocks of 150 trials. Following, the stress group performed exercise on a treadmill until the moment of exhaustion while the non stress group did rest. In retention, all groups practiced the SCM task in one block. During the experiment the trends of saliva cortisol changes were measured. Results: Acute exercise stress leads to a significant increase in salivary cortisol level. While the non-stress group did not show enhancement of SCRT learning across the 24 hours delay interval, the stress group showed substantial enhancement across the same time (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: Our findings indicate that acute stress after acquisition can facilitate the <b>implicit</b> motor <b>memory</b> consolidation...|$|R
40|$|Faces are {{processed}} {{and stored in}} distinct neuroanatomical systems. Based on evidence of a critical role of sleep in memory processes, we investigated the impact of nocturnal sleep on <b>implicit</b> <b>memories</b> for faces in healthy men. Face repetition effects in reaction times were compared across sleep periods early in the night, which are dominated by slow wave sleep (SWS), and late in the night, where rapid eye movement (REM) sleep prevails, as well as across corresponding nocturnal intervals of wakefulness. An inverse priming effect was found selectively across REM sleep rich late sleep, as indicated by distinctly prolonged response latencies to previously presented faces compared with novel faces after this period of sleep (PB/ 0. 05). We assumed this inverse priming to reflect a facilitated identification of previously presented faces after extended REM sleep periods, thereby producing interference with the response generation in our task which did not require face identification but rather required recognizing formal features of the faces. This interpretation {{was supported by a}} supplemen-tary experiment where enhanced positive repetition priming was found across late, REM sleep dominated sleep in a task requiring face identification. Together, these findings indicate that <b>implicit</b> face <b>memories</b> particularly benefit from REM sleep associated brain mechanisms...|$|R

2500|$|Priming is {{a theory}} in which an <b>implicit</b> <b>memory</b> effect in which {{exposure}} to one stimulus (i.e., perceptual pattern) influences the response to another stimulus. The seminal experiments of Meyer and Schvaneveldt in the early 1970s led to the flowering of research on priming of many sorts. [...] Their original work showed that people were faster in deciding that a string of letters is a word when the word followed an associatively or semantically related word. [...] For example, NURSE is recognized more quickly following DOCTOR than following BREAD. [...] Various experiments supported the theory that activation spreading among related ideas was the best explanation for the facilitation observed in the lexical decision task. [...] The priming paradigm provides excellent control over the effects of individual stimuli on cognitive processing and associated behavior because the same target stimuli can be presented with different primes. [...] Thus differences in performance {{as a function of}} differences in priming stimuli must be attributed to the effect of the prime on the processing of the target stimulus.|$|E
2500|$|Negative priming is an <b>implicit</b> <b>memory</b> {{effect in}} which prior {{exposure}} to a stimulus unfavorably influences {{the response to the}} same stimulus. It falls under the category of priming, which [...] refers to the change in the response towards a stimulus due to a subconscious memory effect. Negative priming describes the slow and error-prone reaction to a stimulus that is previously ignored. For example, a subject may be imagined trying to pick a red pen from a pen holder. The red pen becomes the target of attention, so the subject responds by moving their hand towards it. At this time, they mentally block out all other pens as distractors to aid in closing in on just the red pen. After repeatedly picking the red pen over the others, switching to the blue pen results in a momentary delay picking the pen out (however, there is a decline in the negative priming effect when {{there is more than one}} nontarget item that is selected against). The slow reaction due to the change of the distractor stimulus to target stimulus is called the negative priming effect.|$|E
2500|$|Retrograde amnesia is {{typically}} {{the result of}} physical or psychological trauma which manifests itself as the inability to remember information preceding the traumatic event. [...] It is usually accompanied by some type of anterograde amnesia, or inability to acquire new knowledge. Focal retrograde amnesia (FRA), sometimes known as functional amnesia, refers {{to the presence of}} retrograde amnesia while knowledge acquisition remains intact (no anterograde amnesia). Memory for how to use objects and perform skills (<b>implicit</b> <b>memory)</b> may remain intact while specific knowledge of personal events or previously learned facts (explicit memory) become inaccessible or lost. Amnesia can result from a number of different causes, including encephalitis, severe traumatic brain injury, vitamin B1 deficiency as seen in Korsakoff's Syndrome, and psychotic episodes, or by witnessing an emotionally traumatic event (Dissociative amnesia). Dysfunction of the temporal and frontal lobes have been observed in many cases of focal retrograde amnesia, whether metabolic or the result of lesions. However, this evidence only appears to correlate with the symptoms of retrograde amnesia as cases have been observed where patients suffering from minor concussions, showing no visible brain damage, develop FRA. It has been suggested that FRA could represent a variety of different disorders, cognitive deficits, or conditions that result in disproportionate loss of explicit memory, hence Disproportionate Retrograde Amnesia.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} has demonstrated that humans are able to implicitly encode and retain repeating patterns in meaningless auditory noise. Our study aimed at testing the robustness of long-term <b>implicit</b> recognition <b>memory</b> for these learned patterns. Participants performed a cyclic/non-cyclic discrimination task, during which they were presented with either 1 -s cyclic noises (CNs) (the two halves of the noise were identical) or 1 -s plain random noises (Ns). Among CNs and Ns presented once, target CNs were implicitly presented multiple times within a block, and implicit recognition of these target CNs was tested 4 weeks later using a similar cyclic/non-cyclic discrimination task. Furthermore, robustness of <b>implicit</b> recognition <b>memory</b> was tested by presenting participants with looped (shifting the origin) and scrambled (chopping sounds into 10 - and 20 -ms bits before shuffling) versions of the target CNs. We found that participants had robust <b>implicit</b> recognition <b>memory</b> for learned noise patterns after 4 weeks, right from the first presentation. Additionally, this memory was remarkably resistant to acoustic transformations, such as looping and scrambling of the sounds. Finally, implicit recognition of sounds was dependent on participant’s discrimination performance during learning. Our findings suggest that meaningless temporal features as short as 10 ms can be implicitly stored in long-term auditory memory. Moreover, successful encoding and storage of such fine features may vary between participants, possibly depending on individual attention and auditory discrimination abilities...|$|R
