5|$|The airflow {{through the}} main {{radiator}} was controlled by pneumatic exit flaps. In early marks of Spitfire (Mk I to Mk VI) the single flap was operated manually using a lever {{to the left of}} the pilot's seat. When the two-stage Merlin was introduced in the Spitfire Mk IX the radiators were split to make room for an <b>intercooler</b> radiator; the radiator under the starboard wing was halved in size and the <b>intercooler</b> radiator housed alongside. Under the port wing a new radiator fairing housed a square oil cooler alongside of the other half-radiator unit. The two radiator flaps were now operated automatically via a thermostat.|$|E
25|$|Turbocharger units {{often make}} use of an <b>intercooler</b> (also known as a charge air cooler), to cool down the intake air. Intercoolers are often tested for leaks during routine servicing, {{particularly}} in trucks where a leaking <b>intercooler</b> {{can result in a}} 20% reduction in fuel economy.|$|E
25|$|A two-speed, {{two-stage}} supercharger and <b>intercooler</b> {{were used}} to compress then cool the air-fuel mixture, following Griffon and Merlin practice. Starting was by Coffman starter. An auxiliary shaft driven by the lower crankshaft operated the main coolant pump, <b>intercooler</b> coolant pump, pressure and scavenge oil pumps and a fuel injection pump. Piston ring failures and cylinder head sealing problems were experienced during early flight testing.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{systematic}} {{evaluation of}} the solvent capacity and mass transfer benefits of absorber <b>intercooling</b> was conducted for CO 2 capture with 8 m piperazine (PZ) for three different flue gas sources: NGCC (4. 1 % CO 2), coal-fired boiler (14. 7 % CO 2), and steel blast furnace (27. 4 % CO 2). The study identified the best <b>intercooling</b> strategy {{as a function of}} operating conditions (lean loading, liquid to gas ratio (L/G)). For all applications, operation at low lean loadings did not require <b>intercooling</b> to avoid temperature-related capacity or mass transfer penalties. In a broad intermediate loading range, simple in-and-out <b>intercooling</b> provided large solvent capacity benefits (measured as minimum solvent rate, LMIN) compared to a column without <b>intercooling.</b> LMIN was reduced by 71 %, 53 %, and 42 % for NGCC, coal, and steel, respectively. Finally, the coal and steel applications had a large L/G range at higher loadings where <b>intercooling</b> was once again unnecessary. An enhanced <b>intercooling</b> design for NGCC could yield up to 62 % reduction in packing and 46 % reduction in solvent capacity at specific conditions (benefits for coal and steel were much lower). A recycle <b>intercooling</b> design for NGCC was introduced to reduce overall column temperatures and enhance mass transfer. For the case evaluated with recycle <b>intercooling,</b> the new design achieved significant packing reductions (> 50 %) compared to a simple <b>intercooling</b> design and approximated the performance of an isothermal column...|$|R
50|$|In 1995, an <b>intercooled</b> ProCharger system {{became the}} first {{supercharger}} system to receive an emissions exemption (CARB EO # D-365) for an application running more than 8 psi of boost, receiving that exemption for a 14 psi <b>intercooled</b> supercharger system for a 5.0 Mustang. In 1996, ProCharger was the first company to offer complete <b>intercooled</b> supercharger systems for marine applications.|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{absorption}} using aqueous amine {{is one of}} {{the most}} feasible options for post-combustion CO 2 capture. One of the main challenges of this technology is its high energy requirements. Absorber <b>intercooling</b> was considered as a viable method to offer benefits in terms of solvent absorption capacity and mass transfer efficiency in CO 2 absorption processes. However, the effectiveness of absorber <b>intercooling</b> on overall energy requirements depends on other factors such as lean loading and liquid to gas ratio. This study evaluates the benefits of using two different configurations of absorber <b>intercooling,</b> i. e. “in-and-out” and “recycled” <b>intercooling</b> when using 30 wt% aqueous monoethanolamine (MEA) to capture 90 % CO 2 from a natural gas fired turbine with 4 mol% CO 2. The Lean CO 2 loading was varied from 0. 15 to 0. 42 (mol CO 2 /mol MEA) to determine the lean loading at which the application of <b>intercooling</b> is most significant. Absorber <b>intercooling</b> provides the most benefit at lean loading from 0. 30 to 0. 34. The use of in-and-out and recycle <b>intercooling</b> at 0. 34 lean loading, provided 15. 6 and 15. 8 % reduction in the total equivalent work associated with 32. 0 % and 36. 6 % reduction in required packing area when using 1. 2 times the minimum liquid flow rate. At lean loading greater than 0. 34, the benefit of absorber <b>intercooling</b> is a trade-off between reduction of solvent flow rate and total energy requirement and the drawback of greater packing area in the absorber. The greatest saving in total equivalent work, 17 %, was observed at the 0. 36 lean loading associated with nearly 60 % more packing area when using 1. 2 times the minimum solvent flow rate. At very low lean loading and very high lean loading absorber <b>intercooling</b> does not offer significant benefit...|$|R
25|$|Because the <b>intercooler</b> {{required}} a radiator, the radiator under the starboard wing was halved {{in size and}} the <b>intercooler</b> radiator housed alongside. Under the port wing a new radiator fairing housed a square oil cooler alongside the other half-radiator unit. When the engine was running at low speed, one radiator section provided enough coolant; a thermostatic switch turned off the starboard radiator section until more power was called for and extra engine cooling was required.|$|E
25|$|An <b>intercooler,</b> was {{required}} to stop the compressed mixture from becoming too hot and either igniting before reaching the cylinders (pre-ignition knocking) or creating a condition known as knocking or detonation. The <b>intercooler,</b> which was separate from the engine cooling system, with its own supply of glycol and water coolant, was mounted in the induction system, between the outlet of the second-stage supercharger and behind the cylinder blocks. The hot air-fuel mixture from the supercharger was circulated though and around the coolant tubes and was then {{passed on to the}} main induction manifold, through which it was fed into the cylinders. The <b>intercooler</b> also circulated coolant through passages in the supercharger casing and between the impellers. Finally, an extra radiator (mounted in the starboard radiator duct under the wing of the Spitfire) was used to dissipate the intercooler's excess charge heat.|$|E
25|$|Because of a {{slightly}} taller <b>intercooler</b> and rearranged accessories on the Packard Merlins a new, bulged upper cowling was introduced and also appeared on late production IXs.|$|E
