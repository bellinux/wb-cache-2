To overcome this limitation for the ViennaCL library, we investigate a partitioning approach {{for one of the}} standard benchmark problems in High-Performance Computing (HPC), namely the dense matrix-matrix product. We apply this partitioning approach to problems exceeding the available memory on <b>graphics</b> <b>adapters.</b> Moreover, we investigate the applicability on distributed memory systems by facilitating the Message Passing Interface (MPI). Our approach is presented in detail and bench-mark results are given. ...|$|R

40|$|Are you {{considering}} a C++ rewrite {{of an existing}} C program? Are you skeptical about the benefits on OO design might provide? My experience rewriting an MS-DOS program for testing <b>graphics</b> <b>adapter</b> cards on IBM-PC compatible computers is related here. Besides describing the “lessons learned”, I’ll also provide some valuable guidelines {{you can use to}} successfully reengineer existing systems using OO and C++. Prior to my redesign, I had converted the original C program to compile as a C++ program. Several problems cropped up, as described in my previous article. 1 However, this conversion allowed me to add functionality using C++ classes even though the overall design was not objectoriented. In this article I’ll show that a redesign can improve modularity, reduce code size, and produce a significant number of reusable components. Modern <b>graphics</b> <b>adapters</b> are very complex and provide a staggering range of features and operating modes. Although I intend to focus on C++ and the redesign process I first need to explain some of the basic functionality of <b>graphics</b> <b>adapter</b> hardware. Anatomy of a <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> The major components of a <b>graphics</b> <b>adapter</b> are the CRT controller (CRTC), the digital-to-analog converter (DAC), and video memory (VRAM). The adapter can be designed to interface with the ISA bus architecture, but higher performance is possible using the PCI or VESA local bus. The relationship between the adapter components is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 – The relationship between the adapter hardware components. The basic CRT controller functions are based on the Motorola 6845, the mother of modern graphics controllers. These functions control the scanning of the electron beam inside the CRT, which determines the width and height of the display. The CRTC is also responsible for displaying the text cursor. Besides CRT operations, many other functions are needed for complete graphics control...|$|R

5000|$|One of {{the last}} video systems where text semigraphics were a useful option was the Color <b>Graphics</b> <b>Adapter</b> (CGA). This <b>graphics</b> <b>adapter</b> for early IBM-PCs only {{supported}} four colors in its high-resolution graphics mode, but in text mode it could display 16 different colors. Although the CGA adapter's font ROM did not contain all of the otherwise typical text semigraphics characters, it was still possible to create a 160 × 100 CGA text semigraphics mode using a semi-documented trick. With this trick, much more colorful games (like Moon bugs http://www.myabandonware.com/game/moon-bugs-2l) could be programmed on CGA-equipped PCs.|$|R
