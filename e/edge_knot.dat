30|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{presence}} of knots in structural lumber {{is one of the most}} important strengthreducing factors. For practical purposes, visual grading including knot restriction is an effective method for nondestructive evaluation of strength. <b>Edge</b> <b>knot</b> restriction for not only visually graded lumbers but also mechanically graded lumbers is specified in the Japanese agricultural standards for glued laminated lumber. We conducted experimental studies on differences of tensile strength distributions between mechanically high-grade and low-grade Japanese larch (Larix kaempferi, carriere) lumbers daily used for manufacturing glued laminated timbers in Nagano, Japan. We then examined the additional visual grading of mechanically graded lumbers for nondestructive evaluation. We visually graded the prepared mechanically graded lumber by focusing on the knots' area ratio of grouped knots. We confirmed that the higher visual grade related to the stronger tensile strength, similar to our present knowledge; but the effects of knot restriction were reduced when the length of the lumber increased in view of nonparametric 5 th percentiles of tensile strength. The differences in the strength/elasticity ratio between mechanically high-grade and low-grade lumber were negligible. It was clear that the length effect on the ratio in visually graded high-grade lumber was smaller than that of visually graded low-grade lumber. It was thus concluded that knot restriction should have little effect on the tensile strength of mechanically graded lumber.|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. The goal of this research was to develop stress wave grading technology suitable for small lumber mills. Specific goals include: 1) develop an ultrasonic probe configuration to facilitate real-time grain angle and <b>edge</b> <b>knot</b> measurement, 2) determine the statistical correlation between localized stress wave indices and lumber tensile strength and 3) compare the ultrasonic technique with other nondestructive evaluation (NDE) measurements including static MOE, impact stress wave and transverse vibration. Two hundred pieces of 2 x 6 Southern Pine lumber were randomly sampled. Material properties and NDE measurements such as static MOE, impact stress wave and transverse vibration MOEs were collected for the lumber. Before proceeding with final ultrasonic testing, pilot studies were done to study the effect of the strength reducing factors, such as grain angle and edge knots, on ultrasonic wave velocity. Wave velocity decreased as grain angle increased, with more apparent loss taking place at lower angles. The presence of edge knots decreased the wave velocity as measured along the narrow edge of the lumber. Using the knowledge gained from the pilot studies an ultrasonic probe configuration was devised to detect gross grain angle and edge knots. The tests were carried on the lumber using the configuration. Statistical models from localized stress wave indices were developed to predict the tensile strength. The linear correlation between predicted and actual ultimate tensile strength was 0. 724. Ultrasonic testing was a slightly better predictor of ultimate tensile strength than shortspan bending, impact stress wave and transverse vibration techniques which had linear correlations of 0. 716, 0. 696 and 0. 716 respectively. Separately including impact stress wave and transverse vibration MOEs into the ultrasonic model resulted in improved linear correlations of 0. 769 and 0. 787, respectively. In summary, knowledge from this study will be useful in the continuing development of stress wave lumber grading technology. Even though the results were only slightly better than those with short span bending and transverse vibration techniques, the ultrasonic technique appears to be promising for grading of wood...|$|E

30|$|A {{new method}} has been {{developed}} for detecting localized defects such as <b>edge</b> <b>knots</b> using a bending deflection curve. The coordinates of a bottom edge (edgeline) of an unloaded piece of lumber are extracted from a digital image, and a bending deflection curve is obtained from the displacement of the edgeline of the lumber using a digital image correlation (DIC) technique. Depending on the knots within the beam, the bending deflection curve is shifted from the curve of a defect-free beam. The measured bending deflection curve is regressed to a theoretical curve by elementary beam theory. A finite element method (FEM) model of the beams including defects as simplified knot structure has been performed. Comparison between the bending experiment and FEM analysis shows that cross-sectional reductions cause characteristic variations in the bending deflection curves depending on the position of encased knots, and local grain distortions cause variations in the curves depending on the direction of spike knots. Using the residual variance between the measured deflection curve and a polynomial regression curve, {{it is possible to}} detect knots at which failures initiate.|$|R

Radiata pine provides about 90 % structural timber for industry {{and is one of}} the major incomes of the forestry industry in New Zealand. 2. Stiffness, {{strength and}} stability are major quality criteria of structural timber. 3. Radiata pine stem has large proportion of corewood that tends to be low in stiffness, strength and stability. This study first presents the maps of average stiffness, average strength and average warp in radiata pine structural timber, obtained from sixty-two 27 -year old, unpruned radiata pine trees. From these maps, one can conclude that the butt logs are problem logs, because the butt logs displayed the lowest stiffness, as well as the maximum bow and spring within the stems. The stiffness and strength distributions were compared with the typical distribution of wood density, which reveals that the wood density alone does not reflect the mechanical properties of radiata pine structural timber, because: 1) the denser butt logs exhibited the lowest stiffness among all log types; 2) the butt logs were not the strongest logs compared with other log types. Knots are found to be the most important factor weakening the mechanical properties and causing extra distortion in structural timber. 99 % of the boards broke at a knot that is associated also with lower local stiffness. 70 % of maximum bows and 40 % of maximum springs occurred off the expected mid-span, which may be attributed to the deflections introduced by larger margin and <b>edge</b> <b>knots.</b> In order to estimate the failure strength non-destructively, this study examined the failure features of the weakest point in detail, including the local stiffness at the failure zone, the failure pattern of knots and the failure frequency in relation to growth and features of knots.

The goal of this research was to improve mechanical stress grading technology through more accurate lumber strength and stiffness predictions. Specific objectives are: 1) develop a prototype ultrasonic lumber scanning system to measure localized stress wave characteristics in lumber, 2) verify the use of ultrasonics for predicting the long-span tensile strength and modulus of elasticity of Southern Pine lumber. The lumber sample contained 225 pieces of nominal 51 mm (2 in.) x 152 mm (6 in.) x 5. 49 m (18 ft) long No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 grade Southern Pine lumber. After the lumber had reached its equilibrium moisture content, the gross density and transverse vibration MOE were measured. Utrasonic stress wave travel times were automatically collected along the length of each sample with a prototype ultrasonic lumber scanner. This scanner used a configuration of four 200 kHz transducers which were sensitive to slope of grain and <b>edge</b> <b>knots,</b> two growth characteristics which greatly affect tensile strength. The lumber was then destructively tested in tension at a span of 3. 35 m (11 ft). Multivariate regression techniques were used to develop several statistical models to predict ultimate tensile stress (UTS) and MOE. The coefficient of determination (R) between the predicted and actual UTS using the MOE and density data was 0. 590 and 0. 398 respectively. These two nondestructive testing (NDT) variables form the basis for current state of the art grading systems. The ultrasonic predictor variables provided a higher R 2 of 0. 658. The correlation was further improved by combining the ultrasonic variables with MOE and density to provide R 2 values of 0. 760 and 0. 725 respectively. The model combining the ultrasonics, density, and MOE information provided the highest R 2 of 0. 777. The average weighted longitudinal velocity and density were used to predict MOE. The W between the predicted and transverse vibration MOE was 0. 839. In conclusion, the ultrasonic variables were shown to be better predictors of lumber strength than MOE and density. Utrasonics show great potential for accurate prediction of lumber strength and stiffness, and information obtained from this research can be used for future development of an ultrasonic grading system...|$|R

40|$|The {{computer}} programs SnapPea by Weeks and Geo by Casson {{have proven to}} be powerful tools in the study of hyperbolic 3 -manifolds. Manifolds are special examples of spaces called orbifolds, which are modelled locally on Rn modulo finite groups of symmetries. SnapPea {{can also be used to}} study orbifolds but it is restricted to those whose singular set is a link. One goal of this thesis is to lay down the theory for a computer program that can work on a much larger class of 3 -orbifolds. The work of Casson is generalized and implemented in a computer program Orb which should provide new insight into hyperbolic 3 -orbifolds. The other main focus of this work is the study of 2 -handle additions. Given a compact 3 -manifold M and an essential simple closed curve α on ∂M, then we define M [α] to be the manifold obtained by gluing a 2 -handle to ∂M along α. If α lies on a torus boundary component, we cap off the spherical boundary component created and the result is just Dehn filling. The case when α lies on a boundary surface of genus ≥ 2 is examined and conditions on α guaranteeing thatM [α] is hyperbolic are found. This uses a lemma of Scharlemann and Wu, an argument of Lackenby, and a theorem of Marshall and Martin on the density of strip packings. A method for performing 2 -handle additions is then described and employed to study two examples in detail. This thesis concludes by illustrating applications of Orb in studying orbifolds and in the classification of knotted graphs. Hyperbolic invariants are used to distinguish the graphs in Litherland’s table of 90 prime θ-curves and provide access to new topological information including symmetry groups.

The Rc band absolute magnitudes, half light radii and estimated masses of the bright knots are - 12 - - 13 mag, 200 - 300 pc and 10 ^ 6 - 7 Msolar, respectively. Long, narrow H-alpha emitting filaments are connected at the south <b>edge</b> of the <b>knots.</b> The average color of the fireballs is B - Rc = 0. 5, which is bluer than RB 199 (B - R = 0. 99), suggesting {{that most of the}} stars in the fireballs were formed within several times 10 ^ 8 yr. The narrow blue filaments exhibit almost no H-alpha emission. Strong H-alpha and UV emission appear in the bright knots. These characteristics indicate that star formation recently ceased in the blue filaments and now continues in the bright knots. The gas stripped by some mechanism from the disk of RB 199 may be traveling in the intergalactic space, forming stars left along its trajectory. The most plausible fireball formation mechanism is ram pressure stripping by high-speed collision between the galaxy and the hot intra-cluster medium.

40|$|Knotty {{structures}} of Herbig-Haro jets are common phenomena, and knowing {{the origin of}} these structures is essential for understanding the processes of jet formation. Basically, there are two theoretical approaches: different types of instabilities in stationary flow, and velocity variations in the flow. We investigate the structures with different radial velocities in the knots of the HL Tau jet {{as well as its}} unusual behaviour starting from 20 arcsec from the source. Collation of radial velocity data with proper motion measurements of emission structures in the jet of HL Tau makes it possible to understand the origin of these structures and decide on the mechanism for the formation of the knotty structures in Herbig-Haro flows. We present observations obtained with a 6 m telescope (Russia) using the SCORPIO camera with scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer. Two epochs of the observations of the HL/XZ Tau region in Halpha emission (2001 and 2007) allowed us to measure proper motions for high and low radial velocity structures. The structures with low and high radial velocities in the HL Tau jet show the same proper motion. The point where the HL Tau jet bents to the north (it coincides with the trailing <b>edge</b> of so-called <b>knot</b> A) is stationary, i. e. does not have any perceptible proper motion and is visible in Halpha emission only. We conclude that the high- and low- velocity structures in the HL Tau jet represent bow-shocks and Mach disks in the internal working surfaces of episodic outflows. The bend of the jet and the brightness increase starting some distance from the source coincides with the observed stationary deflecting shock. The increase of relative surface brightness of bow-shocks could be the result of the abrupt change of the physical conditions of the ambient medium as well as the interaction of a highly collimated flow and the side wind from XZ Tau.

40|$|Background: A {{large number}} of women undergo {{caesarean}} section throughout the world. These women pass {{through a period of}} post operative pain and a morbidity period. These women translate into a substantial portion of population and hence there is a load on the financial resources of healthcare system. Use of the appropriate technique to approximate the wound after caesarean section would not only avoid financial load but also help in early recovery of the patient. Aim: The aim {{of this study is to}} compare the effects of alternative techniques for closure of subcutaneous fat and skin on maternal health and use of healthcare resources in caesarean section. Materials and Methods: Patients undergoing Caesarean section were divided in two groups of one thousand patients each. Patients with hematological disorders or a malignancy, diabetes, septicemia or chorioamnionitis were excluded from the study. In all the patients, after stitching the uterus, the rectus sheath was stitched with thread vicryl No. 1 (synthetic absorbable braided sutures with polyglycolic acid, polycaprolactone and calcium stearate coating), using a round body needle. Then the patients were divided into two groups. In group I, vicryl No. 1 thread used in stitching of the rectus sheath was continued into the skin with application of subcuticular stitches, after securing the <b>edges</b> with a <b>knot.</b> In group II, after stitching the rectus sheath with vicryl No. 1, the thread was cut and interrupted sutures were applied in subcutaneous fat with thread vicryl No. 2. Skin was stitched with subcuticular stitches using proline 2, a non-absorbable propylene suture. The two groups of patients were observed for the duration of surgery, post-operative pain in stitches, patient satisfaction about removal of stitches, evidence of wound infection or seroma, and cosmetic results. Results: It was noted that the duration of surgery in group I was on average 7. 5 minutes less as compared to the duration in group II. Patients in group I were more satisfied with the results of the surgery and were relieved to know that their stitches did not need to be removed. Conclusion: Although no difference was found in the rates of wound infection and formation of scar tissue between the group I and group II, the duration of surgery was less and the patients were more satisfied in group I...|$|R
