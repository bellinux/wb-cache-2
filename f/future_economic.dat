5|$|South Dakota's early economy {{relied heavily}} on the soil, {{minerals}} and ecology of the area, as {{nearly all of the}} earliest white settlers in the area were farmers, miners, or trappers.

5|$|Brown {{appointed}} {{a group of}} insurance experts to study the state's policies and put them out for bid, ultimately saving $2 million. He also required competitive bids from banks where state funds were deposited; the extra interest generated by this process generated an additional $50 million in revenue to the general fund. He opened communications and contacts with Japan, {{setting the stage for}} <b>future</b> <b>economic</b> relations between that country and Kentucky. Among his other accomplishments as governor were the implementation of competitive bidding for government contracts and passage of a weight-distance tax on trucks.|$|E

Poor maternal health often affects a child’s health in adverse ways and also decreases a woman’s ability to participate in economic activities.

5|$|By the June deadline, Laing {{had made}} a payment of $200,000. GEDCA {{requested}} the outstanding $50,000 along with the $100,000 remaining balance to be paid by Laing by the September deadline. When asked by a local talk radio station if the Max Havoc: Curse of the Dragon settlement money would be a windfall for GEDCA and {{could be used for}} <b>future</b> <b>economic</b> development projects on Guam, GEDCA administrator Karl Pangelinan stated that the money would barely pay for the legal fees incurred during the years of legal fighting with Laing. In September, Rigel Entertainment declared bankruptcy. On October 26, GEDCA board met and established that Laing {{had made a}} partial late payment of $75,000 on the $150,000 still outstanding. A new deadline was set for January 31, 2013. Laing missed the January deadline, but in late February, GEDCA reported receiving the money, thus bringing the lawsuit to a close.|$|E
5|$|When Selvo {{approached}} the city, Guiscard's ships had already {{anchored in the}} harbor at Durazzo. Though the battle was fierce, superior tactics by the skilled Venetian fleet overpowered the inexperienced Normans who were mostly used to land battles. The battered fleet led by Guiscard retreated into the harbor after losing many ships. Victorious at sea, Selvo left the fleet {{under the command of}} his son and returned to Venice a hero. Because of the help given to the Byzantine Empire, the Republic of Venice was awarded a Golden Bull: a decree by Emperor Alexios I Komnenos granting Venice many privileges, including a tax exemption for Venetian merchants, that would be crucial for the <b>future</b> <b>economic</b> and political expansion of Venice in the eastern Mediterranean.|$|E

25|$|Aggregating impacts adds up {{the total}} impact {{of climate change}} across sectors and/or regions (IPCC, 2007a, p.76).

25|$|The {{market for}} land functioned {{efficiently}} and reflected both rapid {{economic development and}} widespread optimism regarding <b>future</b> <b>economic</b> growth. The frequency and turnover rate for land sales were tied to the general business cycle; the overall trend was upward, with {{almost half of the}} sales occurring in the decade before the American Revolution. Prices also rose over time, parallel with the rise in the price for rice. Prices dropped dramatically, however, in the years just before the American Revolution, when fears arose about future prospects outside the system of English mercantilist trade.|$|E

Africa is richly endowed with mineral reserves and ranks first or second in quantity of world reserves of bauxite, cobalt, industrial diamond, phosphate rock, platinum-group metals (PGM), vermiculite, and zirconium.

25|$|Policy {{planners}} {{debated the}} necessity and economic viability of high-speed rail service. Supporters argued that high-speed rail would boost <b>future</b> <b>economic</b> growth.
