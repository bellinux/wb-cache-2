Predstavljeno je Jezusovo delovanje in širjenje krščanstva, pri čemer sta pomembno vlogo odigrala apostola Peter in Pavel. V nadaljevanju je predstavljena vloga cesarja Konstantina pri širjenju krščanstva, saj je le-ta kot prvi cesar sprejel krščanstvo za svojo vero. Diplomska naloga zajema tudi analizo verske politike rimskih cesarjev do cesarja Teodozija I., ki je dal zapreti vse poganske templje in prepovedal vsakršne daritve ter zasebno pogansko čaščenje, krščanstvo pa je postalo edina uradna religija rimskega cesarstva. In the {{beginning}} of the graduation thesis religion is first all defined. Its basic elements, religious systems and religious organisations are described. Then the main characterictics of religious system in Rome as well as Roman gods and <b>godesses</b> are presented. The main part of the thesis is dedicated to Christianity beginning with the description of its early development. This includes Jesus’ activities and the early spreading of Christianity where the role of the apostles St Peter and especially St Paul was of crucial importance. The next part discusses the role of the emperor Constantine for the establishment of Christianity. As well known, he was the first emperor to adopt Christianity as his personal religion. The graduation thesis concludes with an analysis of the religious policies of the Roman emperors until the time of the emperor Theodosius I., who ordered all pagan temples to close and also prohibited any pagan sacrifice or even the private pagan worship. On the other hand, Christianity finally became the sole official religion of the Roman Empire...|$|R

And the Assamese Language speaking {{people call it}} Mikir Bhakha. Latin script is used for institutional practice, but authors use both Latin and Assamese script in various publications. The speakers consider their speech as a variety of the Karbi language.N.B. Amri word is accepted by few Karbi Peoples only. But majority of people of Karbi does not accept this Amri nomenclature for the said language. Because the Amri Kingdom is situated inside the Karbi Anglong district of Assam. But said language is spoken by peoples of Dumura Recho kingdom which is situated outside Karbi Anglong district. So majority of people don't accept Amri nomenclature. The first published book of this language is Arleng Karbi Rat Abhakha Akitap written by Monuram Karkun(Kam Phangcho), in 1955. In 1984 Pinkit Alun is published by AKBKA (Amri Karbi Baptist Kachikruk Ason. It {{is a collection of}} gospel songs of christian religion (Baptist). After this lots of literary works are practiced in Magazines. A few poetry and song books are also found. In 2003 Bhayam Karbi Byakaran written by Biren Keleng is published. In this book he makes a narrative discussion on phonology, morphology and syntax of this language. In 2003 Karbi Alam Kachirli Alo is published by Sonapur College, Sonapur.

The language had a news paper Adap Arni published by Karbi Lamme Amei, Kamrup District Committee. Now it is out of publication. Ranjendra Tumung and Manik Teron write and publish a dictionary on this language. After 1977 the Amri words is used mistakenly by few political leaders. Since then there is silent community war is observed within the people of this language speakers. Only by few christian religious books authors and their followers use the Amri words in their books. Which becomes an obstacle to develop this language. At present it has a quarterly magazine named as Worjul aSi.

40|$|U relativno skromnu inventanru figuralnih mozaika sačuvanih na području Hrvatske posebno mjesto pripada trima velikim mozaicima u lapidarju Arheološkog muzeja u Splitu. Mozaici s likovima Tritona, Orfeja i Apolona, datirani između 2. i 3. stoljeća, pokazuju neke zanimmljivosti kako u ikonografskom tako i u likovnom pogledu. Nastali na izmaku antike, kao djela provincijalnog stila, tri potireskna lika prikazana u mozaiku sačuvala su izvjesnu nezavisnost inspiracije unutar tradicionalnih formula suvremenih mozaičkih radionica. Njihova usporedba s brojnim suvremenim primjerima iz istog tematskog repertoara, navodi na razmišljanja posebno u pogledu njihove ikonografske interpretacije. Among {{the stone}} monuments from Classical Salona in the {{collection}} of the Split Archaeological Museum there are three large figural mosaics known to the Croatian and partially to the foreign scholars. In the literature they are known as mosaics showing Triton, Apollo and Orpheus. The first mosaic shows a male torso, whose hair is composed of whiplik tendriles of a medusa or polyp. A horn emerges from the forehead, caried out in red tessarea and crab 2 ̆ 7 s claws stick out of his untidy hair on the left and right sides of his head. Crab 2 ̆ 7 s claws and the horn on his head are attributes of Titan Oceanus. the oldest son of Uranus and Gaea, gods of the seas and rivers whose visual presentations have their origin in Hellenistic-Roman art, and are especially common in rnosaics of the third century. Depictions of Oceanus are known from mosaics in Munsingen, Bad Kreuznach, Avenches, Vienne, Lyon, Classical Themetra, Ultique, Carranque and other places. He is mostly shown as an old man with a beard, but out character is closest t the young Oceanus with thick hai and a lively expression as in the mosaic in Munsingen. V von Gonzenbach, who dates this mosaic somewhere between the year 175 and 200, supports the view that the crab 2 ̆ 7 s claws on the head are always the attribute of Occanus. The bull 2 ̆ 7 s horn, sticking out of the forehead of the figure of the Salona mosaic, is another of Oceanus 2 ̆ 7 s attributes. 1) The mosaic of Orpheus shows many analogies as well as special features compared to contemporary examples. The composition scheme, with a central medallien surrounded by four semi-circles and segments of circles in the corners of a rectangle, is common in mosaics from the second and third century. In Croatia it is found at three localities. During the first and second centuries Orpheus is shown in a landscape surrounded by numerous animals, as in mosaics in Italy and Africa. From the end of the second and during the third century the scene and the number of characters was reduced. The natural environment and animals are stylized and are persuing each other. In general, the scene is dramatic. According to some authors there are two sources of these different iconographic interpretations of Orpheus. One originates from the Latin West, while the other represents a 2 ̆ 7 mannerist 2 ̆ 7 group formed according to the tradition of the Greek East. Although the Solin mosaic has many characteristics of the "mannerist" group, to which examples from Paphos, Cos, Sparta, Newton St. Loe and Wittington in England belong, the scene in our mosaic is natural, and the character has qualities of a portrait. The seated figure with his lyre leaning against his knee and a hand brushing over the strings is far from the usual stylized, decorative images of Orpheus with his body in semi-profile and head turned towards the viewer, as in the mosaic in Panik. The clothing with soft folds is formed without graphic effects, using lines of dark tessarea, - typical of late Classical art. The Solin mosaic is between the first and second ("mannerist") group of mosaics showing Orpheus from the third and fourth century. The tradition of earlier mosaics is to coney a Classical feeling for a natural scene, and the later ones are stylized and have lost the feeling for dimension and space. In composition it has similarities with the Cos mosaic, and in reduction of the number of figures to the Newton St. Loe Orpheus from Yvonand in Switzerland (dated between 200 and 225) and from Trier because Orpheus does not wear a Frigian cap, which is usually his essential attribute. Closest to this mosaic is the one from Rottweil, which, according to Parlasca, dates from the end of the second century. III. The mosaic showing Apollo dates from the same period as the previous two because of its central composition, large number of borders and the interpretation of the figure in the central medallion. Stylizing and decorative elements can be seen in the treatment of the border characters, while the central figure of Apollo, treated in an almost impressionist manner, has kept its harmony and classical beauty. lf we try o guess the purpose of the areas in which these mosaics were placed, we think first of spas, frigidariums of nyphaenms, which would probably have been part of a governor`s palace. The three mythical figures are connected by the notion of water (sea). Triton (Occanus) is in his natural environment, Orpheus, the divine musician tames nature and leads the animals to spring, and the third figure Apollo, the protector of sailors and the follower of nymphs (<b>godesses</b> of springs) also fits into this combination. Explaining the purpose of certain arcas according to decoration is one of the "helping" methods in the history of art. lt is common and very often successful when it comes to mosaics...|$|R

Their negotiations with Sao Feng are interrupted by an ambush by the East India Trading Company, after which Sao Feng agrees to provide them with the map and a crew. Successfully freeing Jack, they are again attacked by the East India Trading Company, as Sao Feng had betrayed them. Nevertheless, they reach Shipwreck Cove, where Barbossa chairs the assembling of all Pirate Lords. He proposes to free Kalypso, which leads to a fight between the parties.

For this presentation, we selected approaches and technologies which could be relevant for monitoring fast fluctuations at the pelagic redoxcline, seasonal benthic hypoxia and decadal trends oxycline boundary shifts in the Black Sea. Using novel technologies like e. g., the profiling instrumentation platform <b>GODESS,</b> ARGO floats with oxygen optodes and long-term moorings equipped with ADCP and oxygen optodes, temporal and spatial patterns of water column oxygenation from hours to seasons, and from basin-scale to local-scale patterns were resolved. We present examples from study sites in the Baltic Sea and in the Black Sea. The time series recordings of <b>GODESS</b> and mooring arrays allowed a thorough characterization of oscillating redoxclines in the central Baltic Sea and in the Black Sea off southwestern Crimea as temporally dynamic, three-dimensional systems. For the first time, oxygen sensor equipped ARGO type profiling floats were deployed in the Black Sea and proved to be powerful tools to address seasonal changes in patterns of water column oxygenation on larger spatial scales and {{emphasize the importance of}} mesoscale processes for oxygen distribution in the Black Sea basin. A 3 -month continuous time series recording of a stand-alone static mooring equipped with optical oxygen sensors, current meters, and turbidity sensors identified summer hypoxia to be a highly dynamic process and provided insights into the controls of hypoxia formation on the north-western Black Sea shelf. Existing multi-decadal time-series monitoring data were used to demonstrate the imprint of climate change and eutrophication on long-term oxygen distributions and, hence, the importance of maintaining long-term commitments to oxygen monitoring programs. Such time series data allow separating out the effects that climatic forcing and eutrophication exert on oxygen depletion i. e., in the Black Sea. Standard CTD measurements in the central Black Sea over the last 90 years reflect the rising of the upper boundary of the suboxic zone in the 1970 s and 1980 s due to eutrophication, and again in the 1990 s and 2000 s due to NAO forcing, while eutrophication relaxed. Our comprehensive study within HYPOX was able to address many aspects of hypoxia in aquatic systems and revealed the vital need for dedicated oxygen monitoring at appropriate spatial and temporal scales with appropriate technologies. The variety of hypoxia characteristics and consequences emphasizes also the need for a careful selection of locations and periods of time for oxygen observations in order to adequately address the risk for hypoxia formation and ecosystem response...|$|E
40|$|M. D Raghavan, {{who made}} a study of native races and castes expresses that the mask drama, a kind of folk drama existed and in fact still {{existing}} to some extent in west and south coast of maritime regions in Sri Lanka is related with the Karava caste {{which is one of}} the major migratory castes of the island. The objective of this study is to launch a deep investigation into the observation he made with special reference to the Tukkavadu Kolamancestry of Maha Ambalangoda which belongs to Karava caste. The study revealed the following important points. The commencement of mask drama in Sri Lanka is associated with the Karava caste army brought from Kanchi puram,Kilakkare,Kaveri Pattanam when Puttalam was seized by Mukkaras, a group of invaders in the reign of king Parakramabahu-vi of Kotte. Those peoples were the believers of the <b>Godess</b> Kali at that time even the local people had already been performing variety of dancing by way of offering to demons and deities. It seems probable that the Kolam nataka came to being as a result of blending of Kolamthullal dance performed by Keralas on behalf of the Goddess Kali with the kind of dancing already existed in the island. Adoption as an entertainment of early practice performed for Kali in the colonial politico-economic context could be examined later. Carpentry was the duty assigned to Karava caste in the feudal system. Thus they were inborn artists in carving masks. The most significant fact came to light out of this investigation done into the history of Tukkawadu ancestry of Maha Ambalangoda which attracted the attention of a large number of those who studied the mask is this it was the ritual dancers or gurunnanses -devil dancers- of Thunduwa and Suddagoda, two villages of Berava (tom-tom beaters) caste in Bentota, who contributed singing, playing, words and verse to the mask drama. Though at the begging people belonging to different castes performed just the particular duty entrusted to him in time to come they took part in many other trades without distinction. Accordingly those who belonged to Karava caste took part in singing and playing where as that of Berava practiced carving masks. On the basis of the above inquiries the following findings were reached. Namely the origin of mask drama cannot be traced by means of one particular caste. It is an admixture of multi-ethnic and multi-religious cultural elements. While changing its form in accordance with time and tide mask drama under went influence of various cultures in its mode from exorcism to delight full and incidental art. Even in case of Tukkavadu ancestry which is the subject of this study a singular contribution has been made by both the castes Karava and Berava to the continuity of the mask drama. Although it is invariably associated with the migration of Karava caste the mask drama cannot be branded exclusively as a heritage of their own. It can be observed that following the national independence without resorting to cast issues there is a tendency towards continuity of performing art such as mask drama as one of the national symbolism. This approach diminished caste identities further...|$|E
40|$|The last {{decades have}} seen a {{strongly}} increasing use of computers for modeling larger and more complex systems. This has been {{made possible by a}} combination of increasing computer power and easy-to-use graphical modeling environments and libraries of components. An important class of systems are described by initial value problems for dynamical systems, and the increasing size and complexity imply that problems are more often either Differential Algebraic Equations (DAE), or stiff Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE). Time-stepping methods for solving DAEs and stiff ODEs have been extensively studied, and the methods have also been implemented in a number of successful codes. Turning a method into a practical implementation requires a number of supporting algorithms, but in spite of their importance we find these to be less well-studied than the time-stepping methods. The supporting algorithms are the key to adaptivity: how to estimate errors, which step-sizes to use, how to start iterations, when to terminate them, when to re-factor Jacobians, etc. The goal of this dissertation is to partially bridge the gap between methods and implementations by studying and improving the algorithms supporting Implicit Runge-Kutta (IRK) methods applied to DAEs and stiff ODEs. Studies of supporting algorithms require both the construction and analysis of simplified models and experimental validation, where we only vary the algorithmic aspect under consideration. The experimental validation has been carried out in the Generic ODE Solving System (<b>Godess),</b> which has been developed in parallel to this thesis and facilitates the necessary means for a strict validation. The dissertation focuses on the iterative process used to compute the intermediate stages in the steps of the IRK methods. The difficulties in the iterative process and the results presented in this dissertation are: The iterative process need accurate predictors to minimize the number of iterations. We construct predictors of orders exceeding the stage order of the method. We also prove that this is only possible by adapting the predictors to the individual stages. The iterations must be terminated after a finite number of iterations. The effects of this are studied in this dissertation and the results include: For algebraically accurate IRK methods starting with an explicit stage we introduce stage derivative reuse (SDR) methods. We prove stiffness independent bounds for the error propagation in the SDR methods. All algebraically accurate IRK methods can employ SDR methods as accurate and inexpensive error estimators. The iterations are in general terminated when the iteration error is below a pre-defined tolerance. We relate the error at the end-point of the step to the errors in the stages. We present a formula relating the tolerance for the iterations to the tolerance for the time-stepping method. The factorization of the Jacobian is often kept for several consecutive steps. An algorithm giving nearly optimal balance between the time spent in the iterations for the stages and the re-factorization and re-computation of the Jacobian is given. The algorithm uses a simple criterion based on the rate of convergence of the iterations. An analysis verifies that the algorithm also has the right asymptotic behavior...|$|E
