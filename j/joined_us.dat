5|$|Henry is of Antillean heritage: his father, Antoine, is from Guadeloupe (La Désirade island), and his mother, Maryse, is from Martinique. He {{was born}} and raised in Les Ulis suburb of Paris which, despite {{sometimes}} being seen as a tough neighbourhood, provided good footballing facilities. As a seven-year-old, Henry showed great potential, prompting Claude Chezelle to recruit him to the local club CO Les Ulis. His father pressured him to attend training, although the youngster was not particularly drawn to football. He <b>joined</b> <b>US</b> Palaiseau in 1989, but after a year his father fell out with the club, so Henry moved to ES Viry-Châtillon and played there for two years. US Palaiseau coach Jean-Marie Panza, Henry's future mentor, followed him there.|$|E
5|$|When the U.S. Highway System {{was created}} in 1926, US 9 was {{designated}} in New Jersey to run from US 30 in Absecon north to the New York border in Alpine, where it continued into New York as US 9W. In New Jersey, the route followed the entirety of pre-1927 Route 4 between Absecon and Rahway, bending farther {{to the east of}} its current alignment between Lakewood and South Amboy by running closer to the Atlantic Ocean. In Rahway, US 9 <b>joined</b> <b>US</b> 1 and pre-1927 Route 1 for a concurrency north toward Newark. Past Newark, the road followed current US 1/9 Truck toward Jersey City, where US 1 and US 9 split. At this point, US 9 continued north on its current alignment in Fort Lee, where it then ran north on present-day CR 501 toward the New York border. US 9 was designated along this alignment to the New York border as the original numbering plans called for it to continue up {{the west bank of the}} Hudson River to Albany, New York, with US 109 running along the east bank of the river. However, it was instead split into two suffixed routes in New York, with US 9W running along the west bank and US 9E running along the east bank, New Jersey had kept its alignment of US 9 to US 9W at the border in Alpine.|$|E

5|$|Yet {{with the}} Phuoc Tuy {{province}} coming progressively under control throughout 1967, the Australians increasingly spent a significant {{period of time}} conducting operations further afield. 1 ATF was subsequently deployed astride infiltration routes leading to Saigon to interdict communist movement against the capital as part of Operation Coburg during the 1968 Tet Offensive and later during the Battle of Coral–Balmoral in May and June 1968. At Fire Support Bases Coral and Balmoral the Australians had clashed with regular North Vietnamese Army and Viet Cong main force units operating in battalion and regimental strength {{for the first time}} in near conventional warfare, ultimately fighting their largest, most hazardous and most sustained battle of the war. During 26 days of fighting Australian casualties included 25 killed and 99 wounded, while communist casualties included 267 killed confirmed by body count, 60 possibly killed, 7 wounded and 11 captured. Other significant Australian actions included Binh Ba in June 1969, Hat Dich in late-December 1968 and early 1969 and Long Khanh in June 1971. At the height of the Australian commitment, 1 ATF numbered 8,500 troops, including three infantry battalions, armour, artillery, engineers, logistics and aviation units in support. A third RAAF unit, No. 2 Squadron RAAF, flying Canberra bombers, was sent in 1967, and four RAN destroyers <b>joined</b> <b>US</b> patrols in the waters off North Vietnam.|$|E

50|$|The two {{highways}} {{run through}} Sweetwater before reaching Abilene. US 84 leaves the interstate {{on the western}} side of the city, running with I-20's business loop. <b>US</b> 84 <b>joins</b> <b>US</b> 83/US 277, with US 277 leaving the concurrency after a short distance. US 84 leaves US 83, northeast of Tuscola. US 84 runs southeast to Coleman, overlapping with US 283 in the process and <b>joining</b> <b>US</b> 67. After leaving Brownwood, US 84 leaves <b>US</b> 67 and <b>joins</b> <b>US</b> 183. US 84 becomes a solo route again in Goldthwaite, traveling through Gatesville. In Gatesville, the hwy meets SH 36, which coincidentally also runs to Abilene, albeit in a more direct way than US 84.|$|R

25|$|When U.S. 52 {{went through}} Downtown Indianapolis, it went onto Brookville Road, then turned right onto English Avenue. It then <b>joined</b> <b>U.S.</b> 421 when it turns right onto Southeastern Avenue. US 52/421 <b>joined</b> <b>U.S.</b> 40 {{when it turned}} left onto Washington Street. It then splits into Washington Street (westbound) and Maryland Street (eastbound). US 52 then turned right onto West Street (from West Street, it turned left onto Maryland Street). U.S. 52 turned left on either Indiana Avenue or 16th Street (US 136). Eventually, U.S. 52 would overlap U.S. 136 on 16th Street. It then turned right onto Lafayette Road, which became Indianapolis Road when {{reaching}} Zionsville. When I-65 was completed through Downtown Indianapolis, U.S. 52 got on I-65 from the Lafayette Road interchange, and traveled on I-65 {{the rest of the}} way. In 1970, the route was re-routed onto the south belt of I-465 from Brookville Road to I-65. It was re-routed again on its current route around Indianapolis in either 2000 or 2001.|$|E
25|$|Maurice Princet <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> often. Although quite young, {{thanks to}} his {{knowledge}} of mathematics he had an important job in an insurance company.

25|$|The {{news of the}} {{assassination}} of Elisha F. Riggs spread throughout the United States. At that time Puerto Rican Senator, Luis Muñoz Marín, was in Washington, D.C. and Ernest Gruening, the administrator of the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration (1935–1937), asked him to condemn Riggs' assassination. Muñoz Maríntof told Gruening {{that he would do}} so only if he was also allowed to condemn the police for murdering the Nationalists in the city police station without a trial. Gruening then <b>joined</b> <b>US</b> Senator Millard Tydings a Democrat from Maryland, in a legislative proposal to grant independence to Puerto Rico.

25|$|In 1939, Wattenberg joined Schenley Industries, a {{distiller}} of whiskey, {{where he}} performed spectroscopic analysis. He <b>joined</b> <b>US</b> Steel in 1940. The consequential increase in salary and reduction in working hours to 30 {{hours per week}} enabled {{him to go back}} to graduate school at Columbia University to get his PhD. In 1941, his studies were interrupted by World War II. Enrico Fermi asked him to join the group at Columbia working on the nuclear fission of uranium that also included Herbert L. Anderson, Bernard T. Feld, Leo Szilard and Walter Zinn. Wattenberg learned how to build and maintain the Geiger counters and photon and neutron detectors.|$|E

25|$|By {{the mid-19th}} century, the U.S. Government had begun sending {{surveying}} expeditions into the newly incorporated territories of the American West. Albert Bierstadt ventured {{on at least}} two of these expeditions, which, along with other trips in the West, would inspire an incredible amount of his creative output. On his first expedition in 1859, he <b>joined</b> <b>U.S.</b> explorer Frederick W. Lander, taking photographs of Native Americans and painting field sketches of the landscape. They traveled through Kansas, Nebraska, and into the Wind River Range of the Rocky Mountains in Wyoming. This expedition resulted in paintings such as On the Sweetwater Near the Devil's Gate, Nebraska; Sunset Light, Wind River Range of the Rocky Mountains; Thunderstorm in the Rockies; and most notably, two works similarly titled The Rocky Mountains, Lander's Peak.|$|E

25|$|In mid-July, they <b>joined</b> <b>US</b> battleships in a {{bombardment}} of industrial installations at Hitachi. During the Okinawa campaign, the pair supported British carriers. Their last offensive action {{was a night}} {{bombardment of}} Hamamatsu on 29 to 30 July 1945. Duke of York and Anson arrived too late {{to take part in}} hostilities, but on 15 August they accepted the surrender of Japanese forces occupying Hong Kong. King George V and Duke of York were present at the official Japanese surrender in Tokyo Bay. After the end of World War II, King George V became the flagship of the Home Fleet until December 1946, when it became a training vessel, before being scrapped in 1957. Duke of York became the flagship of the Home Fleet after King George V, until April 1949, before being scrapped in 1957. Howe returned to Portsmouth in January 1946 and spent the remainder of her career there before being scrapped in 1957. Anson briefly served as the flagship of the 1st Battle Squadron of the British Pacific Fleet and helped to re-occupy Hong Kong, however, in 1949 she was placed into reserve before being scrapped in 1957.|$|E
25|$|By 1940, US 111 was redesignated as U.S. Route 15. As in {{previous}} years, PA 14 remained concurrent with the roadway now carrying US 15 to Northumberland. From Northumberland south to Duncannon, PA 14 was realigned onto the western {{bank of the}} Susquehanna River, creating an overlap with U.S. Route 11. At Duncannon, US 11 split from PA 14 and crossed the Susquehanna while PA 14 continued south along the riverbank to Lemoyne, a suburb of Harrisburg. Here, PA 14 <b>joined</b> <b>US</b> 11 on a brief overlap east across the Susquehanna into Harrisburg. At Front Street, US 11 turned north while PA 14 continued east on Market Street. PA 14 then turned right onto 4th Street, following the road out of Harrisburg to Paxtang, where PA 14 terminated at U.S. Route 322 and U.S. Route 422. In 1941, PA 14 was rerouted to {{the east side of}} the Susquehanna River from Muncy to Clarks Ferry on what is now Interstate 180 and Pennsylvania Route 147; the US 15 designation was moved west to run concurrent with US 11. From Clarks Ferry to Harrisburg, PA 14 was concurrent with U.S. Routes 22, and 322. By 1960, PA 14 was truncated to end at US 22 and US 322 in Clarks Ferry.|$|E
25|$|The central {{conflict}} during Florida's territorial {{period was}} with the Seminole. Earlier in the 1800s, a series of battles {{that was the first}} of three Seminole Wars sought to prevent Seminoles from harboring runaway slaves and to protect the right of white settlers to occupy land in Florida. A Second Seminole War began in 1835. It pivoted on the issue of Indian removal, a plan to move all Seminoles in Florida to land west of the Mississippi by 1835. A number of the Seminole chose to fight rather than leave their homes. In 1835, warriors led by Osceola began waging guerilla warfare. They attacked and burned plantations on the St. Johns River and elsewhere in Northeast and Central Florida. Local volunteers <b>joined</b> <b>U.S.</b> forces and state militia to fight the Seminoles. Fort Marion in St. Augustine became the center for U.S. military action, with Army officers often billeting at boarding houses and hotels in the city. Displaced settlers and families from nearby plantations sought refuge in St. Augustine. Visitors from outside Florida continued to travel to St. Augustine, though their numbers slowed during the heat of the conflict. During this tumultuous period, St. Augustine was crowded with people requiring room and board. In 1845, when Florida joined the Union as the 27th state, the boarding house industry was firmly established, with a reputation as a healing destination for invalids.|$|E
