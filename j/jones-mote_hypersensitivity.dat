40|$|A {{previous}} report of increased intensity and prolongation of contact hypersensitivity in animals pre-treated with cyclophosphamide (CY) {{has been confirmed}} using other immunosuppressive agents. Melphalan, ICRF 159 and azathioprine caused a similar increase in contact sensitivity reactions, whereas busulphan, procarbazine and chlorambucil were inactive in this respect. The increased contact hypersensitivity {{was not associated with}} increased lymph node activity. Pre-treatment with CY, ICRF 159 and melphalan also caused increased intensity and prolonged Jones—Mote type reactions so that they resembled tuberculin-type reactions. This was associated with a marked reduction in γ 1 antibody production. It is therefore suggested that <b>Jones—Mote</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> is a further example of a T-lymphocyte reaction modulated by a B-lymphocyte response...|$|E
40|$|Modification of the {{cellular}} immune response by sensitization with adjuvants containing tubercle bacilli has been carefully studied in whole animals of several species (1 - 5). Guinea pigs immunized with a foreign protein in Freund's complete adjuvant (CFA) 1 develop persistent delayed hypersensitivity with an erythematous skin test response that is delayed in onset, indurated, and characterized histologically by a prominent mononuclear infiltrate (1, 6). By contrast, animals immunized with a protein in Freund's incomplete adjuvant (IFA) without tubercle bacilli exhibit an erythematous reaction that is delayed in onset, but that lacks significant induration and {{that can only be}} elicited at early intervals after sensitization (7 - 10). Raffel and Newel (7) differentiated this "Jones-Mote " reaction from that of classic delayed hypersensitivity, but many have considered <b>Jones-Mote</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> only a weak expression of the delayed response (see reference 11 for review). Recently, Dvorak et al. (10) have demonstrated that Jones-Mote lesions exhibit a distinct histology, featuring substantial accumulations of basophilie leukocytes in addition to mononuclear cells, and have suggested that cutaneous basophil hypersensitivit...|$|E
40|$|Antigen-mediated {{stimulation}} of thymidine incorporation was demonstrated in lymph node cells from guinea pigs immunized with 100 µg human serum albumin in either Freund's incomplete or Freund's complete adjuvant. Animals receiving HSA in IFA exhibited both cutaneous basophil (<b>Jones-Mote)</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> and lymphocyte stimulation at 1, {{but not at}} 6 wk after immunization. Significant stimulation required ≥ 10 µg HSA/ml of culture. Sensitization with HSA in CFA produced delayed hypersensitivity and permitted lymphocyte stimulation at both 1 and 6 wk. Stimulation was observed with as little as 0. 1 µg HSA/ml at the later interval. Administration of 5 mg HSA intravenously {{at the time of}} sensitization with 100 µg HSA in IFA reduced but did not eliminate both CBH and lymphocyte stimulation at 1 wk. Antigen-specific inhibition of macrophage migration could be demonstrated with exudates from animals immunized with HSA in CFA, but not with HSA in IFA at 3 wk after sensitization. HSA was cleared from depots of CFA and IFA at similar rates, but significantly more antigen appeared in the plasma and subsequently in the draining lymph nodes following administration in IFA. Conversely, accumulated antigen disappeared more rapidly following CFA immunization...|$|E
40|$|Delayed-type {{hypersensitivity}} against staphylococcal antigens was induced in {{guinea pigs}} using Freund's incomplete {{as well as}} Freund's complete adjuvant. In animals sensitized with Freund's complete adjuvant the induction time and the duration of delayed-type hypersensitivity were longer and the skin reactions were stronger compared to animals sensitized with Freund's incomplete adjuvant. The difference between animals sensitized with Freund's incomplete or complete adjuvant may reflect the difference between tuberculin- and <b>Jones-Mote</b> type <b>hypersensitivity...</b>|$|R
40|$|Relationships among T-cell {{mediated}} cytotoxicity, tuberculin type <b>hypersensitivity,</b> <b>Jones-Mote</b> type <b>hypersensitivity</b> and {{activation of}} helper T cells were studied in AKR mice {{by means of}} target cell destruction (51 Cr-release), footpad reaction, migration inhibition test and antibody production against the trinitrophenyl group. (1) Immunization with chicken red blood cells (CRBC) in saline, Freund's incomplete (FIA) or complete adjuvant (FCA) and fixed-CRBC (FRBC) in FIA or FCA induced delayed hypersensitivity as demonstrated by footpad swelling. (2) Migration inhibition was positive in the group immunized with CRBC in saline or FCA, or FRBC in FCA, but negative in those immunized with CRBC or FRBC in FIA. This may suggest that the former has to be assigned to tuberculin type and the latter to Jones-Mote type. (3) T-cell mediated cytotoxicity by immune spleen cells was detected only in mice immunized with CRBC in saline. (4) Pre-treatment with cyclophosphamide augmented delayed footpad reaction in mice immunized with CRBC in saline, but suppressed cytotoxic activity. (5) FRBC in saline scarcely induced delayed footpad reaction and cytotoxic activity, whereas they activated helper function efficiently. Thus, four types of immunological phenomena, attributable to the functions of T cells, may depend upon distinct subpopulations of differentiated T cells which are raised by different methods of immunization...|$|R

(1) Immunization with SRBC in saline, Freund's incomplete adjuvant (FIA) or complete adjuvant (FCA) and fixed-SRBC (FRBC) in FIA- or FCA-induced delayed hypersensitivity as demonstrated by footpad swelling.

(3) Both pre-treatment with BCG and with cyclophosphamide (CY) augmented delayed footpad reaction in the mice immunized with SRBC in saline. However, migration inhibition was positive only in the group pre-treated with BCG. BCG may convert the reaction from Jones-Mote type to tuberculin type, while CY may augment the reaction of Jones-Mote type. (4) FRBC in saline scarcely induced delayed footpad reaction, whereas they activated helper function efficiently.

40|$|Delayed onset {{erythematous}} skin reactions elicited in {{guinea pigs}} {{early in the}} course of sensitization with azobenzenearsonate-protein conjugates or with protein antigens in incomplete Freund's adjuvant or in saline were found to have a characteristic morphology which sets them apart from delayed hypersensitivity and the classic antibody mediated reactions. The principle feature was massive dermal infiltration with basophilic leukocytes. Mononuclear cells of several types including activated and small lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, and blast cells were also present. Such reactions have in the past been designated <b>Jones-Mote</b> <b>hypersensitivity,</b> but we prefer the descriptive term cutaneous basophil hypersensitivity (CBH) for the reasons given. Occasional basophils extruded their granules, and individual granules, retaining their characteristic ultrastructure, were commonly seen in the interstitium. However, intercellular junctions between endothelial cells were closed except during cell emigration and there was no morphologic evidence of an histamine-like effect. The majority of basophils, moreover, did not degranulate but underwent nuclear pyknosis and cytoplasmic degeneration and were phagocytosed by macrophages. Phagocytosed basophil granules retained their ultrastructure. Skin tests performed at late intervals after sensitization had a different time course and morphology. Animals sensitized with protein antigens in complete Freund's adjuvant developed delayed hypersensitivity; however, reactions elicited in such animals at early (but not late) intervals after sensitization contained a prominent basophil component. We interpret such reactions to be a mixture of delayed hypersensitivity and cutaneous basophil hypersensitivity. The function of the basophil in CBH and its relation to the mononuclear cells which accompany it are unknown, and various possibilities are discussed. We conclude that cutaneous basophil hypersensitivity is a distinct immunologic and morphologic entity, occurring early {{in the course of}} sensitization with protein antigens incorporated in any of several vehicles. The mechanism of the reaction is presently unknown, and a general hypothesis to explain its pathogenesis has been proposed...|$|E
40|$|Relationship between delayed-in-onset {{erythema}} and infiltrating leucocytes in {{the skin}} reaction site of <b>Jones-Mote</b> type <b>hypersensitivity</b> was observed in guinea-pigs. Guinea-pigs were immunized with formalin-fixed (F-SRBC) or native form (N-SRBC) of sheep red blood cells in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA). Elicitation was carried out with intradermal injection of F-SRBC or N-SRBC in saline 1 or 3 weeks after immunization. One week after immunization with F-SRBC or N-SRBC in IFA, erythema accompanied by basophil infiltration was detected, but antibody production was negative. Erythema reached a peak at 24 h, but basophil infiltration reached a peak at 48 h or later. In the skin reaction site elicited with N-SRBC, high levels of basophil infiltration were detected persistently even after erythema had disappeared. Three weeks after immunization, low titres of PCA (passive cutaneous anaphylaxis) were detected in guinea-pigs immunized with F-SRBC in IFA. At that time erythematous skin reaction was detected, but the level of basophil infiltration was {{lower than that of}} 1 week after immunization. In guinea-pigs immunized with N-SRBC in IFA, skin reaction of the Arthus type accompanied by haemorrhage was observed at the site elicited with N-SRBC...|$|R
40|$|Summary. -Peripheral-blood basophils were counted, {{in thick}} smears, in samples from {{patients}} with primary bronchial carcinoma, from {{patients in the}} same wards and from normal individuals. The median counts for patients with other chest conditions (15 - 5 / 4 d) and bronchial-carcinoma patients free of tumour months to years after resection (16 / 1 l) {{did not differ from}} those for normal individuals (19 / 1,u), but tumour-bearers showed higher counts (median 33 / 1 z), 24 / 41 having counts above the highest count in normal individuals (29 / 1 l) : P< 0. 002). The highest values were in patients with squamous bronchial carcinoma, apparently reflecting spontaneous challenge of an anti-tumour immune response. In those tested at the time of diagnosis, higher values in both lymphocyte and basophil counts were related to surgical resectability. BASOPHIL LEUCOCYTES are known to be involved in immediate hypersensitivity and the cutaneous basophil <b>hypersensitivity</b> (<b>Jones-Mote)</b> reaction, but their overal...|$|R
