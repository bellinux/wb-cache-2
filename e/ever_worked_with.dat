25|$|The main cast were {{designed}} by manga artist Kōsuke Fujishima, {{who at the time}} was working on the long-running manga series Oh My Goddess!. Before Fujishima joined the project, the characters had placeholder designs created by Red Company staff. There was resistance from Fujishima's editors due to his heavy work load, including his commitment to Oh My Goddess!. Sakura Wars was the first time Fujishima had <b>ever</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> Sega or been associated with a Sega property, and he was skeptical due to state the project was in when he was first approached, being in a very early stage of development before story or gameplay mechanics had been finalized. Red Company's placeholder character designs were in place {{at a time when it}} was uncertain whether Fujishima would join, but Hiroi was adamant that Fujishima would be character designer. Fujishima eventually joined the project by the end of 1994, with his first design being for Sakura. His initial sketches for Sakura moved Hiroi to tears, and fully convinced both Red Company and Sega that Fujishima was the right person. The positive reception of Fujishima's work, together with his understanding for the project's goals, helped raise staff morale for the entire project.|$|E

James Gray wrote the movie especially for Cotillard after meeting her at a French restaurant with her boyfriend. Gray stated that Cotillard is the best actor he's <b>ever</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with.</b> Cotillard had to learn 20 pages of Polish dialogue for her role. Her performance was widely acclaimed at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival where the film premiered. The Immigrant was released in the U.S. on May 2014, exactly one year after its Cannes premiere, and was highly praised by American critics, especially Cotillard's performance, which was awarded the New York Film Critics Circle Award, the National Society of Film Critics Award, the Toronto Film Critics Association Award and {{was nominated for a}} Spirit Award for Best Actress in 2015. She then co-starred in Guillaume Canet's Blood Ties, alongside Clive Owen, Billy Crudup and her Rust and Bone co-star Matthias Schoenaerts, the film premiering at Cannes in the same week that The Immigrant premiered.

The exterior scenes were filmed at Vancouver International Airport. Executive producer John Shiban was asked to write a speech for Garrett in the scene in which Mulder encounters him on the airplane. Inspired by a speech given by Orson Welles in The Third Man, Shiban wrote the monologue as an homage to the film. The scenes of the airplane's final airborne moments included eighty extras who Manners felt were [...] "eighty of the best extras I've <b>ever</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> in my life". Several extras were as young as four years old, leading series creator Chris Carter to note that the scene would benefit from showing younger children, though these were represented by dolls as a safety precaution.|$|E
500|$|Kubrick {{credited}} {{the ease}} with which he photographed scenes to his early years as a photographer. He rarely added camera instructions in the script, preferring to handle that after a scene is created, as the visual part of film-making came easiest to him. Even in deciding which props and settings would be used, Kubrick paid meticulous attention to detail and tried to collect as much background material as possible, functioning rather like what he described as [...] "a detective". Cinematographer John Alcott, who worked closely with Kubrick on four of his films, and won an Oscar for Best Cinematography on Barry Lyndon, remarked that Kubrick [...] "questions everything", and was involved in the technical aspects of film-making including camera placement, scene composition, choice of lens, and even operating the camera which would usually be left to the cinematographer. Alcott considered Kubrick to be the [...] "nearest thing to genius I've <b>ever</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with,</b> with all the problems of a genius".|$|E

500|$|Madeline Parker {{was cast}} as Kacey Brynn. Parker's {{performance}} impressed the producers, as they {{believed she was}} [...] "one of the better child actors" [...] they <b>ever</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with,</b> since casting them, especially at a younger age, was not easy. The one problem they had with Parker however, was filming her lying injured on the stairs. In the scene where the NCP arrest civilians at night, {{the idea of using}} night vision, which did not come from the original script, came from director Sergio Mimica-Gezzan. Real night scopes were used to ensure the authenticity of the effect. One of the main visual effects of the episode was another suicide bombing which was caught on camera. Moore stated to have [...] "tortured the visual effects guys about [...] quite a bit," [...] because the camera footage was in black and white and the visual quality of the explosion had to be degraded to match the footage.|$|E

Every day on the set was a very, very special thing for me. Hearing all these guys sing, I don't know if I can ever have an experience like that again."" [...] Burton said of the singing, [...] "You can't just lip synch, you'd see the throat and the breath, every take they all had to belt it out. It was very enjoyable for me to see, with music on the set everybody just moved differently. I'd seen Johnny (Depp) act in a way I'd never seen before, walking across the room or sitting in the chair, picking up a razor or making a pie, whatever. They all did it in a way that you could sense." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{process was}} {{improved}} again, to allow repeated separation of lanthanum from the barium solution, as the lanthanum built up.

This was later abandoned when an oxalate or hydroxide method was developed; lanthanum was precipitated as lanthanum hydroxide and then {{converted to a}} filterable precipitate by addition of oxalate with a trace of fluoride. The oxalate method had to be performed quickly, as the oxalate ion was susceptible to radiolysis and the lanthanum had the tendency {{to go back into}} solution. The oxalate process could be performed by remotely operated devices. The batches contained about [...] of radiolanthanum, the highest radiation levels people had <b>ever</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> at that time.

40|$|Since the {{foundational}} work of Farjoun and Machover, important {{contributions to the}} ﬁeld of probabilistic economy have been made. In this context one naturally has conservation of money as a postulate. However it is questionable whether a capitalist economy could <b>ever</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> entirely exogenous money, and {{it is interesting to}} see to what extent probabilistic arguments can illuminate the evolution of the type of endogenous money system that characterizes contemporary capitalism. We ﬁrst argue, on probabilistic grounds, that a system with a strict conservation law on money was historically unsustainable. We then make the case that phenomena such as the formation of a rate of interest, periodic commercial crises, and the formation of a rentier class can be understood using the sort of reasoning pioneered by Farjoun and Machove...|$|R
5000|$|After working <b>with</b> Hoschna, his <b>works</b> {{had given}} {{somewhat}} of a name for himself. Arthur Hammerstein asked Harbach in 1912 to write the lyrics to an operetta with Rudolf Friml, called The Firefly. Victor Herbert was originally supposed to write the music, {{but he refused to}} <b>work</b> <b>with</b> the star of the show Emma Trentini because in his last show, she refused to sing a song for the encore, and Herbert walked out refusing to <b>ever</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> her again. Hammerstein could not find anyone as talented as Herbert, but settled on the unknown Friml because of his classical training. The result was a huge success, and it would spell eleven more musicals, including High Jinks (1913) (which featured the song [...] "All Aboard Dixieland" [...] by Jack Yellen and George L. Cobb) and Katinka (1915). Most of the shows they wrote together ran for over 200 performances. In 1914, he contributed the libretto only to the Percy Wenrich musical The Crinoline Girl.|$|R
500|$|Although they {{initially}} {{worked well}} together, Simon and Groening's relationship became [...] "very contentious" [...] according to Groening. Simon never expected {{the show to}} be a success, often proclaiming to fellow staff members [...] "We're thirteen and out"—meaning that the show would be canceled after the thirteen episodes of the first season. Therefore, he also told the staff that they had creative freedom {{to do whatever they}} wanted to make The Simpsons as good a show as possible, regardless of network or public opinion, because he thought it inevitably would not be renewed; he elaborated in 2009 that [...] "really I was saying that to take the pressure off of everyone. I was just saying let's just go out and make 13 episodes that are really good and really funny." [...] However, Groening interpreted it as meaning Simon was uncommitted and did not care whether the show was a success or not, as Simon's career would survive, whereas his own would not. In 2001, Groening described Simon as [...] "brilliantly funny and one of the smartest writers I've <b>ever</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with,</b> although unpleasant and mentally unbalanced." [...] According to John Ortved's book , when the show became successful Simon resented the media attention Groening received, particularly the praise for the show's writing; Simon felt that Groening's involvement was limited, and that he should have been the one receiving credit for the show. Simon later spoke well of Groening's influence, particularly on the show's positive tone.|$|E
500|$|Steiger had {{intended}} {{returning to the}} stage, and had signed on to play the title character in Bertolt Brecht's Galileo, at the Lincoln Center Repertory Company in April 1967, but the production was cancelled when he became ill. Steiger won the Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Chief of Police Bill Gillespie in In the Heat of the Night, opposite Sidney Poitier. He played a Southern police chief searching for a murderer. Prejudiced against blacks, he jumps {{to the conclusion that}} the culprit is Virgil Tibbs (Poitier), an African-American man passing through town after visiting his mother, who later turns out to be an experienced homicide detective from Philadelphia. The film deals with the way the two men interact and join forces in solving the crime, as Steiger's Gillespie learns to greatly respect the black man he initially took to be a criminal. Steiger drew upon his experience in the Navy with a Southerner named [...] "King", remembering his accent. Poitier considered Steiger and Spencer Tracy to have been the finest actors he had <b>ever</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with,</b> remarking in 1995, [...] "He's so good he made me dig into bags I never knew I had." [...] A. D. Murphy of Variety described Steiger's performance as [...] "outstanding", writing: [...] "Steiger's transformation from a diehard Dixie bigot to a man who learns to respect Poitier stands out in smooth comparison to the wandering solution of the murder."

Here I Stand displayed his vocals as [...] "agile" [...] and [...] "balletic", as well as his ability to [...] "easily drift from wavering tenor to fine-tuned falsetto" [...] that create emotions of urgency and burning according to Clover Hope of The Village Voice. Looking For Myself exemplified his craft and earned him positive acclaim as Gawker's Rick Juzwiak says [...] "his vocal range is even more impressive than his emotional one" [...] with emphasis on his falsetto being [...] "something that sounds as natural as a speaking voice...he's the picture of grace against shrieking synths [...] His emotional range is vast enough to sell tenderness, lechery and wistfulness within minutes of each other". Regarding [...] "Climax", his performance was lauded as [...] "blistering" [...] by Maura Johnston, and [...] "terrific" [...] by Jody Rosen, as he won Best R Performance in 2013. [...] "There Goes My Baby" [...] and [...] "Dive" [...] are also commended as showcase standouts of his [...] "superior R vocal range" [...] by Consequence of Sound's Ryan Hadfield, and MadameNoire's Brande Victorian.
