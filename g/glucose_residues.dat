25|$|Glycogen is a {{branched}} biopolymer {{consisting of}} linear chains of <b>glucose</b> <b>residues</b> {{with an average}} chain length of approximately 10-14 glucose units.

25|$|Glycogen {{synthesis}} is, unlike its breakdown, endergonic—it {{requires the}} input of energy. Energy for glycogen synthesis comes from uridine triphosphate (UTP), which reacts with glucose-1-phosphate, forming UDP-glucose, in a reaction catalysed by UTP—glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase. Glycogen is synthesized from monomers of UDP-glucose initially by the protein glycogenin, which has two tyrosine anchors for the reducing end of glycogen, since glycogenin is a homodimer. After about eight glucose molecules {{have been added to}} a tyrosine residue, the enzyme glycogen synthase progressively lengthens the glycogen chain using UDP-glucose, adding α(1→4)-bonded glucose. The glycogen branching enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a terminal fragment of six or seven <b>glucose</b> <b>residues</b> from a nonreducing end to the C-6 hydroxyl group of a glucose residue deeper into the interior of the glycogen molecule. The branching enzyme can act upon only a branch having at least 11 residues, and the enzyme may transfer to the same glucose chain or adjacent glucose chains.|$|E

5000|$|A similar quality-control {{molecular}} chaperone, calnexin, {{performs the}} same service for soluble proteins as does calreticulin. Both proteins, calnexin and calreticulin, have {{the function of}} binding to oligosaccharides containing terminal <b>glucose</b> <b>residues,</b> thereby targeting them for degradation. In normal cellular function, trimming of <b>glucose</b> <b>residues</b> off the core oligosaccharide added during N-linked glycosylation {{is a part of}} protein processing. If [...] "overseer" [...] enzymes note that residues are misfolded, proteins within the rER will re-add <b>glucose</b> <b>residues</b> so that other calreticulin/calnexin can bind to these proteins and prevent them from proceeding to the Golgi.

40|$|A {{series of}} 4 β-triazole-linked glucose podophyllotoxin conjugates have been {{designed}} and synthesized by employing a click chemistry approach. All the compounds were evaluated for their anticancer activity against a panel of five human cancer cell lines (HL- 60, SMMC- 7721, A- 549, MCF- 7, SW 480) using MTT assays. Most of these triazole derivatives have good anticancer activity. Among them, compound 35 showed the highest potency against all five cancer cell lines tested, with IC 50 values ranging from 0. 59 to 2. 90 μM, which is significantly more active than the drug etoposide currently in clinical use. Structure-activity relationship analysis reveals that the acyl substitution on the <b>glucose</b> <b>residue,</b> the length of oligoethylene glycol linker, and the 4 &# 039;-demethylation of podophyllotoxin scaffold can significantly affect the potency of the anticancer activity.

50|$|N-linked glycans are {{extremely}} important in proper protein folding in eukaryotic cells. Chaperone proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, such as calnexin and calreticulin, bind {{to the three}} <b>glucose</b> <b>residues</b> present on the core N-linked glycan. These chaperone proteins then serve {{to aid in the}} folding of the protein that the glycan is attached to. Following proper folding, the three <b>glucose</b> <b>residues</b> are removed, and the glycan moves on to further processing reactions. If the protein fails to fold properly, the three <b>glucose</b> <b>residues</b> are reattached, allowing the protein to re-associate with the chaperones. This cycle may repeat several times until a protein reaches its proper conformation. If a protein repeatedly fails to properly fold, it is excreted from the endoplasmic reticulum and degraded by cytoplasmic proteases.|$|E
50|$|Cellulose {{biosynthesis}} is {{the process}} during which separate homogeneous β-(1→4)-glucan chains, ranging from 2,000 to 25,000 <b>glucose</b> <b>residues</b> in length, are synthesized and then immediately hydrogen bond with one another to form rigid crystalline arrays, or microfibrils. Microfibrils in the primary cell wall are approximately 36 chains long while those of the secondary cell wall are much larger, containing up to 1200 β-(1→4)-glucan chains. Uridine diphosphate-glucose (UDP), which is produced by the enzyme sucrose synthase (SuSy) that produces and transports UDP-glucose to the plasma membrane is the substrate used by cellulose synthase to produce the glucan chains. The rate at which <b>glucose</b> <b>residues</b> are synthesized per one glucan chain ranges from 300 to 1000 <b>glucose</b> <b>residues</b> per minute, the higher rate being more prevalent in secondary wall particles, {{such as in the}} xylem.|$|E

For 7 -O-diglycosides, the internal glucose loss is very pronounced for aglycones of the flavanone type, but is completely absent for aglycones of the flavone and flavonol types. Internal <b>glucose</b> <b>residue</b> loss was found to correspond to a minor fragmentation pathway for flavonol 3 -O-diglycosides.

50|$|Once {{transferred}} to the nascent peptide chain, N-linked glycans, in general, undergo extensive processing reactions, whereby the three <b>glucose</b> <b>residues</b> are removed, {{as well as several}} mannose residues, depending on the N-linked glycan in question. The removal of the <b>glucose</b> <b>residues</b> is dependent on proper protein folding. These processing reactions occur in the Golgi apparatus. Modification reactions may involve the addition of a phosphate or acetyl group onto the sugars, or the addition of new sugars, such as neuraminic acid. Processing and modification of N-linked glycans within the Golgi does not follow a linear pathway. As a result, many different variations of N-linked glycan structure are possible, depending on enzyme activity in the Golgi.|$|E
