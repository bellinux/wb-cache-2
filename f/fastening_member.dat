40|$|The {{collective}} intercity transportation by bus {{is currently}} a mean of locomotion much sought after by people. Security in accidents {{is a very important}} factor that {{must be taken into account}} in design of bus body structure, being the evaluation of passenger safety of this type of vehicle is an important subject that should be checked, because in many accidents occur disconnection between seats and <b>fastening</b> <b>members</b> causing serious passengers injury, often fatal. This work aims at evaluation the behavior of frame fixing of seats of intercity bus bodies, submitted to the frontal impact situation in a rigid wall of 100 % offset, through evaluation by finite element method (FEM). This study uses a numerical model corresponding to the body structure and chassis, developed through flexible beam elements, combining with shell elements for the structure of the seats and its <b>fastening</b> <b>members,</b> with the objective of not missing the essential aspects of the problem, allowing the solution with a reduced computational time. The numerical model of bus body and seat was impacted against a rigid wall at a speed of 8. 89 m/s, being its validation according to the deceleration curve established by Regulation 80. Then it was gotten the Von Mises stress in <b>fastening</b> <b>members</b> of the seat structure in bus body. It is also presented a proposal to improve the fastening of the seat structure, comparing the results of the stress gotten in the two types fastening submitted to the frontal impact...|$|R

50|$|Timber-framed {{structures}} {{differ from}} conventional wood-framed buildings in several ways. Timber framing uses fewer, larger wooden members, commonly timbers {{in the range}} of 15 to 30 cm (6 to 12 in), while common wood framing uses many more timbers with dimensions usually in the 5- to 25-cm (2- to 10-in) range. The methods of <b>fastening</b> the frame <b>members</b> also differ. In conventional framing, the members are joined using nails or other mechanical fasteners, whereas timber framing uses the traditional mortise and tenon or more complex joints that are usually fastened using only wooden pegs. Modern complex structures and timber trusses often incorporate steel joinery such as gusset plates, for both structural and architectural purposes.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{increasing}} demand for light weight, high quality and more cost effective product has led adhesive bonding {{to emerge as}} one of the primary 60 ways of <b>fastening</b> structural <b>members.</b> East Adhesive joints have previously been designed empirically but now a day's data is available to design adhesive joints in West an optimum way. The fixing of cylindrical 40 components subjected to torque is a common requirement in industrial manufacture and {{there is a need to}} design and North optimize the adhesively bonded cylindrical 20 joint for maximum torque transmission capability facilitating keyless fastening.

40|$|The {{characterization}} of fatigue resistance {{is one of}} the main concerns in structural engineering, a concern that is particularly important in the evaluation of existing bridge members designed or erected before the development of fatigue design provisions. The ability of a structural member to develop alternate load paths after the failure of a component is known as member-level or internal redundancy. In <b>fastened</b> built-up <b>members,</b> these alternate load paths are affected by the combination of fastener pre-tension and friction between the structural member components in contact. In this study, a finite element methodology to model and analyze riveted and bolted built-up members was developed in ABAQUS and validated with experimental results. This methodology was used to created finite element models of three fastened plates subjected to tension, in which the middle plate had failed, in order to investigate the fundamental effects of combined fastener pre-tension and friction on their mechanical behavior. Detailed finite element models of riveted and bolted built-up flexural members were created and analyze to understand the effect of fastener pre-tension in member-level redundancy and resistance to fatigue and fracture. The obtained results showed that bolted members are able to re-distribute a larger portion of the load away from the failing component into the rest of the member than riveted members, and that this transfer of load also took place over a smaller length. Superior pre-tension of bolts, in comparison to rivets, results in larger frictional forces that develop at the contact interfaces between components and constitute additional alternate load paths that increase member-level redundancy which increase the fatigue and fracture resistance of the structural member during the failure of one of its components. Although fatigue and fracture potential may be mitigated by compressive stresses developing around the fastener hole due to fastener pre-tension, it was also observed, that at the surface of the fastener hole and at the contact interface with another plate, tensional stresses could develop; however, further computational and experimental work should be performed to verify this claim. ...|$|R
30|$|Cold-formed {{structural}} members {{are being used}} more widely in routine structural design as the world steel industry moves from the production of hot-rolled section and plate to coil and strip, often with galvanized and/or painted coatings. Steel in this form is more easily delivered from the steel mill to the manufacturing plant where it is usually cold-rolled into open and closed section members. In the present experimental study, the use of packing plate at the joints in cold-formed channel sections may increase the load carrying capacity and also reduce the buckling of unconnected cold form channel steel plate at joints. The present study focuses on examining the experimental investigation to use mild steel as a packing plate with cold-formed channel sections by bolted connection at the joints and the connection subjected to axial tension. Series of tests are carried out with increase in the thickness of packing plate and results are observed and analyzed. Total Twelve experimental tests {{have been carried out}} on cold-formed channel tension <b>members</b> <b>fastened</b> with single as well as three numbers of bolts at the connection and from the observations the strength of the joint is increased by increasing the various thicknesses of packing plates and also the buckling of unconnected leg of channel specimen is reduced. It is analyzed by plotting the entire load versus elongation path, so that the behavior of the connection is examined.|$|R
40|$|Mechanically <b>fastened</b> {{built-up}} steel <b>members</b> {{have long}} been known to possess internal member redundancy and, as a result, multiple load paths which can be exploited to increase their functional life. Internal redundancy provides the ability to resist total member failure {{in the event of}} a fracture of an individual component. However, there is little experimental data in the literature regarding post-fracture capacity in terms of strength and subsequent fatigue life. The experimental study currently underway will provide needed information on parameters that affect the ability of built- up members to arrest a fracture as well as the available remaining fatigue life. Additionally, further information concerning load redistribution and energy release during a fracture is being studied. Test specimens consist of both existing riveted and new high-strength bolted large-scale built-up plate girders. The results from this study will be used to develop recommended design and assessment procedures for both types of members in the as-fractured condition. The potential exists to remove the fracture critical classification from existing and new bridges in which built-up members are utilized. In cases where sufficient capacity exists and the fracture critical designation can be removed, rational in- service inspection procedures will also be developed. This presentation will report on the research results obtained to date. Considering the large number of riveted fracture critical bridges in the inventory, many agencies will benefit through implementation of more rational based inspection frequencies resulting from this study. Further, new members utilizing high-strength bolted built-up members could also be used without the penalty of being classified as fracture critical in terms of inspection...|$|R
40|$|The term tape setback method denotes {{a method}} of {{designing}} and fabricating bonded joints between (1) box beams or other structural members made of laminated composite (matrix/ fiber) materials and (2) metal end fittings used to <b>fasten</b> these structural <b>members</b> to other structural members. The basic idea of the tape setback method is to mask the bonded interface between the metallic end fitting and composite member such that the bond does not extend out to the free edges of the composite member. The purpose served by the tape setback method is to strengthen the joints by decoupling stress concentrations from edge defects, which can cause premature failures. A related prior method that serves a similar purpose, involving the use of tapered adherends at the joints, can be too difficult and costly to be acceptable in some applications. The tape setback method offers an easier, less costly alternative. The structural members to which the method was originally applied were box beams {{in the form of}} composite tubes having flat faces with rounded corners. The end fittings were plugs made of a low-thermal- expansion nickel/iron alloy (see figure). In computational-simulation studies of tensile and compressive loading of members without tape setback, stresses were found to be concentrated at the free end edges of the composite tubes, and inspection of members that had been subjected to real tension and compression tests showed that cracks started at the free end edges. As applied to these members, the tape setback method makes them less vulnerable to initiation of failure at edge defects produced during fabrication. In real tension tests of comparable members without and with tape setback, the average mean tensile strength of the members with tape setback was found to be 1. 9 times that of the members without tape setback...|$|R
