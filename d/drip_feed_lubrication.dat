The mid-1950s saw the hasty introduction of diesel and electric rolling stock to replace steam in a modernisation plan costing many millions of pounds but the expected transfer back from road to rail did not occur and losses began to mount.

50|$|Ring oilers {{were used}} for speeds up to around 1,000 rpm. Above this, the oil tended to be thrown {{centrifugally}} from the ring, rather than carried by it (although it is still currently applied on steam turbines with speeds around 3200 rpm). The bearing must also remain horizontal and stable, so although suitable for crankshaft main bearings, {{they could not be}} used on connecting rod big end bearings. They were not used on vehicles for similar reasons, although the engines concerned at this time were anyway too large and heavy for practical mobile use. Automatic ring oilers were particularly useful for large engines with multiple horizontally opposed cylinders, where it was otherwise difficult to access the central main bearings. Ring oilers were most suited where bearing side-loads were relatively light, but the bearing capacity required more lubrication than could be supplied by a <b>drip</b> <b>feed</b> oiler.

40|$|The {{article focuses}} on the issue {{regarding}} the survival, preservation of life, health and neuropsychic development of infants with extremely low birth weight. 25 preterm infants aged 0 to 4 weeks were studied. The inclusion criteria were infants aged 28 – 34 weeks of gestation, with weights ranging from 1, 000 to 1, 850 g. Enteral feeding consisted of specialized formula with prebiotics (6 hours after birth through a <b>drip</b> <b>feeding</b> tube), increasing to 150 ml/kg a day {{by the age of}} 10 – 12 days. The study results demonstrated that the maximum weight loss was recorded on day 4, 0 ± 1, 5. The original body weight was restored, on average, on day 13. The average daily weight gain was 14, 0 g/kg a day which evidenced good digestion of nutrients and high energy value of the formula. The results of lab tests showed a reduced level of nonesterified fatty acides, a slow waning of _-fetoprotein synthesis.

40|$|The 89 -year-old {{film-maker}} {{and designer}} Franco Zeffirelli {{is recognised for}} his spectacular mise en scène and professional mastery in the spheres of international cinema and opera, yet is critically despised by ‘serious’ film critics in Italy and abroad. This essay explores Zeffirelli's habitus (in Bourdieu's terms) {{within the field of}} Italian and international cinema and concludes that he differentiates himself from conventional accounts of auteur authority by his appeal to a middlebrow audience. The paper then investigates how Zeffirelli has maintained contact with this constituency over his long career. On the international front, these include the career choices he has made, the opportunities offered by new audiences thirsty for cultural capital and the technological development of new media products, such as his use of performance codes on DVD extras and reissues of his films and opera productions. On the local, rather than global, front, he maintains his Italian identity and appeal to a middlebrow constituency through a <b>drip</b> <b>feed</b> of controversial interventions {{in the same way as}} Katie Price. He is vocal in his support of Silvio Berlusconi, expresses other controversial opinions in the press and social media, and intervenes regularly in support of the Fiorentina football team. The paper concludes by identifying the precariousness of the processes by which Zeffirelli constructs himself as an auteur in old age, and the mechanisms by which his constituency remakes the authorial sign and recognises him as a celebrity auteur...|$|R
50|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the evening McGuire acted as an intermediary and seems to have taken pleasure in his newfound power over the revered Vernon who wanted an audience with Scott. McGuire had spent the last decade trying to circle with some of the top professionals. He used his money, and his considerable knowledge, to assist other performers and constantly expand his knowledge of magic and secret sleights.However he was never able to get close to two of the best, Dai Vernon or Sam Horowitz.So McGuire got close to a magician both men admired, Max Malini, and through clever use of his association with Malini got to Horowitz.With his knowledge of Scott, McGuire had leverage and a worth to the top cardmen. For months before the June demonstration he had been giving some notes on Scott's work to Cardini.In 1931 he released a collection of manuscripts involving aspects of Scott's work which became known as The Phantom of the Card Table. Around thirty copies were released selling for as much as $50 each (approx $500 in today's currency).Through his <b>drip</b> <b>feeding</b> of notes to Horowitz and Cardini he got Vernon to start calling.

40|$|Aim: To {{investigate}} {{the presence of}} inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and to evaluate the progression of bowel involvement after two years' follow-up in seven patients affected by glycogen storage disease type Ib (GSDIb). Methods: Seven patients (5 F, 2 M, aged 4. 5 - 20. 6 y) entered the study. Bowel involvement was evaluated by ileocolonoscopy and specific IBD serologic markers. To evaluate disease activity, Paediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI), terminal ileum wall thickness detected at ultrasonography (US), 99 mTechnetium labelled autologous White Cell Scan (Tc-WCS) and barium meal with follow-through were investigated. Results: Ileocolonoscopy and histology examination revealed variable degrees of bowel involvement in all patients. The results of serologic markers were indicative of a Crohn's-like ileocolitis. US and Tc-WCS, could clearly define patients with severe inflammatory involvement, but failed to identify all patients with mild to moderate disease. For the most severely affected patients, anti-inflammatory agents and steroids were prescribed, whereas nutritional therapy with polymeric formula and antibiotics were assumed by two other patients and antibiotics only by one patient. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was prescribed to all patients. Ileocolonoscopy and histology data improved in all patients. The assumption of G-CSF and/or gastric <b>drip</b> <b>feeding</b> (g. d. f.) was inversely associated with the PCDAI results (p < 0. 05).

In total 58 AGL mutations (non-missense mutations were overrepresented and 21 novel mutations were observed) were identified in 76 families. GSDIII patients first presented {{before the age of}} 1. 5 years, hepatomegaly was the most common presenting clinical sign.

5000|$|Harrison {{has been}} very active in the UK media, with dozens of {{newspaper}} and magazine articles, and many TV and radio interviews. Since 2005, several commentators have agreed that his predictions have consistently proved correct. As an example, in 2005 there was an almost unanimous view that the rise in house prices would moderate and that any talk of a [...] "housing bubble" [...] was both premature and indicated a false understanding of debt economics. Harrison warned {{that there would be}} a two-year explosive growth in prices and property speculation before the market imploded in the winter of 2007/08 with heavy damage to the financial markets. As shown by the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis, he was essentially correct on all points. His prediction that the problems with debt economics and scaling would contribute to a worldwide economic depression has been borne out. There has been a major recession as a result of the mortgage crisis. The UK took 7 years for the growth rate in gross domestic product per head to recover to the pre-2008 peak. However, GDP remained nearly a fifth smaller than if long-term pre-crisis growth trends had continued. The costs of the depression included the rise in public debt across the western world which, in the UK case, was close to 50 per cent of GDP. Other economies recovered earlier than the UK, but they remained dependent on the <b>drip</b> <b>feed</b> of QE (quantitative easing) and near-zero interest rates; implying that self-sustaining growth had not yet returned to the advanced market economies (as at July 2015).|$|R
