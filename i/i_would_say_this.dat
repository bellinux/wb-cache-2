I would describe it as an attempt at making an adult breakup record. The consequences to what the characters are going through are more significant. There's just more to it. I'm 37 and the world around me is a lot different than when I was writing breakup songs in my 20s. I tried to reflect that in what the lyrics are." [...] Adkins elaborated: [...] "With Damage the point was love songs. But the type of love songs that interest me deal with adversity and emotional injury. If you have a happy song about how happy you are, I just want to slap you. There's no story there for me. I can't have any empathy." ...|$|E

2500|$|AllMusic felt [...] "...the Soulful British crooner James Blunt's wistful debut infuses the {{listener}} – in order – with rainy-day hope, the wistful comfort of unattainable love, and finally, world-weary resignation. While his parched and effeminate falsetto recalls Gasoline Alley-era Rod Stewart {{with a healthy}} dose of Antony and the Johnsons, it's the late Elliott Smith who casts the largest shadow on Back to Bedlam." [...] Q magazine and Common Sense Media awarded the album four stars out of five. RocknWorld stated [...] "It's hard to describe James Blunt or his music without falling prey to many a cliché or hyperbole. Comes from the UK, serves in the army then makes an album of movingly sincere ballads which make a huge impression on his homeland and Australia, thus allowing him to enjoy phenomenal, chart topping success. However, in this case, the music Blunt is making does really deserve and warrant the hype surrounding him. Strangely enough, even with his music being all over the radio here in Australia, I cannot begrudge the fact that Blunt is truly talented and has made himself a damn good debut record." [...] BBC Collective said [...] "It's very rare I give an album 5 stars. Many have come close, but just missing it. I never thought <b>i</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>this,</b> but Back To Bedlam has not got one bad track on it. I've listened to it 3 times back to back, just to make sure." [...] Slant Magazine said, in a three and a half star review, that [...] "Bedlam is an overall raw listening experience" [...] and that though [...] "Blunt's writing often juxtaposes love with death" [...] that it's [...] "More reason for American girls to go gaga over this able British bloke." ...|$|E

60|$|First of all <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>this,</b> {{which must}} be obvious to many, however much they deplore it: Christianity must change or must perish. That is the law of life--that things must adapt {{themselves}} or perish. Christianity has deferred the change very long, she has deferred it until her churches are half empty, until women are her chief supporters, and until both the learned {{part of the community}} on one side, and the poorest class on the other, both in town and country, are largely alienated from her. Let us try and trace the reason for this. It is apparent in all sects, and comes, therefore, from some deep common cause.|$|E

You must assert your right to yourself, and she must surrender her authority to me, and she must leave you for a time. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> even if my own mother spoke to me through you.

In them you will find all the revealed truths, which have been set forth and offered to you, clearly and circumstantially recorded; and, in addition to these, examples of obedience and disobedience both in states and individuals, the lives and actions of men eminent under each dispensation, their sentiments, maxims, hymns, and prayers--their affections, emotions, and conflicts;--in all which you will recognise the influence of the Holy Spirit, with a conviction increasing with the growth of your own faith and spiritual experience." ...|$|R

60|$|The other day, by an accident, an {{old number}} of the 'Athenæum' fell into my hands, and I read {{for the second time}} Mr. Chorley's {{criticism}} upon 'Atherton.' It is evidently written in a hurried manner, and is quite inadequate as a notice of the book; but, do you know, I am of opinion that if you considered it more closely you would lose your impression of its being depreciatory and cold. He says that the only fault of the work is its shortness; a rare piece of praise to be given to a work nowadays. You see, your reputation is at the height; neither he nor another could help you; such books as yours make their own way. The 'Athenæum' doesn't give full critiques of Dickens, for instance, and it is arctical in general temperature. I thought <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>this</b> to you. Certainly I do know that Mr. Chorley highly regards you in every capacity--as writer and as woman--and {{in the manner in which}} he named you to me in his last letter there was no chill of sentiment nor recoil of opinion. So do not admit a doubt of him; he is a sure and affectionate friend, and absolutely high-minded and reliable; of an intact and even chivalrous delicacy. I say it, lest you might have need of him and be scrupulous (from your late feeling) about making him useful. It is horrible to doubt of one's friends; oh, I know that, and would save you from it.|$|E
