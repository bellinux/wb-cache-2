5|$|Outside {{a bar in}} Washington DC, Raymond Dees (Joe Chrest) calls 911 on a payphone. He says nothing, simply typing {{the numbers}} 522666 on the phone's <b>keypad.</b> Later, he watches the bar from a parking garage nearby, masturbating as the bomb he has left inside detonates.|$|E
5|$|The {{operator}} interface {{provides a means}} for an operator to start and stop the motor and adjust the operating speed. Additional operator control functions might include reversing, and switching between manual speed adjustment and automatic control from an external process control signal. The {{operator interface}} often includes an alphanumeric display and/or indication lights and meters {{to provide information about}} the operation of the drive. An operator interface <b>keypad</b> and display unit is often provided {{on the front of the}} VFD controller as shown in the photograph above. The <b>keypad</b> display can often be cable-connected and mounted a short distance from the VFD controller. Most are also provided with input and output (I/O) terminals for connecting push buttons, switches, and other operator interface devices or control signals. A serial communications port is also often available to allow the VFD to be configured, adjusted, monitored, and controlled using a computer.|$|E

50|$|The {{arrangement}} of digits on numeric <b>keypads</b> with the -- keys two rows above the -- keys {{is derived from}} calculators and cash registers. It is notably different from the layout of telephone Touch-Tone <b>keypads</b> which have the -- keys on top and -- keys on the third row.|$|R
50|$|The {{keyboards}} on the touchpad <b>keypads</b> {{featured a}} different and less crowded key layout along with the touchpad, which is used for navigation. The touchpad <b>keypads</b> are also compatible with older calculators that are running OS 2.0 or newer. The new calculators that were shipped with touchpad <b>keypads</b> supported an optional rechargeable battery. The second generation is also available in two models, the TI-Nspire Touchpad and TI-Nspire CAS Touchpad, and each model has maintained the color of itself, with the normal one being white and black while the CAS is black and gray.|$|R
5|$|The {{machine was}} {{simultaneously}} presented {{for the first}} time and launched in September 1985 at the SIMO '85 trade show in Spain, with a price of 44,250 pesetas. Because of the large number of unsold Spectrum+ models, Sinclair decided not to start selling in the UK until January 1986 at a price of £179.95. No external <b>keypad</b> was available for the UK release, although the ROM routines to use it and the port itself remained.|$|E
5|$|While the MacBook Pro largely {{followed}} the industrial design standard {{set by the}} PowerBook G4, the MacBook was Apple's first notebook to use features now standard in its notebooks – the glossy display, the sunken keyboard design and the non-mechanical magnetic latch. With the late 2007 revision, the keyboard received several changes to closely mirror the one which shipped with the iMac, by adding the same keyboard short-cut to control multimedia, and removing the embedded numeric <b>keypad</b> and the Apple logo from the command keys.|$|E
5|$|Bertie the Brain was {{an early}} {{computer}} game, {{and one of the}} first games developed in the early history of video games. It was built in Toronto by Josef Kates for the 1950 Canadian National Exhibition. The four meter tall computer allowed exhibition attendees to play a game of tic-tac-toe against an artificial intelligence. The player entered a move on a lit <b>keypad</b> in the form of a three-by-three grid, and the game played out on a grid of lights overhead. The machine had an adjustable difficulty level. After two weeks on display by Rogers Majestic, the machine was disassembled at the end of the exhibition and largely forgotten as a curiosity.|$|E

5|$|Millennium Group {{consultant}} Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) {{watches the}} aftermath of the explosion on the news, knowing that the group will ask for his assistance with the case. Dees is among the rescuers seen on the broadcast. Black travels to DC and meets up with fellow group member Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn). The two join the FBI task force investigating the bombing, led by special agents Pierson (Sam Anderson) and Takahashi (Hiro Kanagawa). Watts and Black quickly dismiss several false claims of responsibility by terrorist groups. Black listens to the 911 call left by Dees, deducing that the numbers dialled spell the word kaboom on a telephone <b>keypad.</b>|$|E
5|$|Potential contestants of the {{original}} primetime version had {{to compete in a}} telephone contest which had them dial a toll-free number and answer three questions by putting objects or events in order. Callers had ten seconds to enter the order on a <b>keypad,</b> with any incorrect answer ending the game/call. The 10,000 to 20,000 candidates who answered all three questions correctly were selected into a random drawing in which approximately 300 contestants competed for ten spots on the show using the same phone quiz method. Accommodations for contestants outside the New York City area included round trip airfare (or other transportation) and hotel accommodations.|$|E
5|$|The Rudd Center for Professional Wine Studies, {{a two-story}} {{distillery}} building dating to around 1889, {{is used for}} the Professional Wine Studies program and was named after the Rudd family of Rudd Farms. The building has sensory analysis classrooms with wireless <b>keypad</b> response systems, built-in light boxes, and expectoration stations. The Rudd Center contains a pantry, a 4,000-bottle wine cave and private dining room, and a terrace. Karen MacNeil is the creator and chairman of the center. The building opened in 2003 for a wine professional credential; the school began its wine and beverage certification program in 2010. In 2013 the school began a wine, beverage, and hospitality concentration in its bachelor's degree program.|$|E

5|$|Overall {{gameplay}} {{is similar}} to past entries in the series. The player, as Alex, explores the various environments and locales, searching for clues to advance the plot, such as photographs, drawings and other items which are placed inside Alex's journal, which the player may read at any time. To assist the player, Alex will turn his head towards items and clues to inform the player that the object may be picked up; other recurring items include weapons and ammunition, which give off a glow as a visual cue to the player, and health drinks. Puzzle elements also {{play a part in}} the game, and Alex's journal may be used to refer to photographs and other items that can help the player decipher such puzzles as <b>keypad</b> entries. For {{the first time in the}} series, the player may select responses when engaging in dialogue with other characters encountered in the game, which in turn may affect how the player sees the plot unfold.|$|E
5|$|The World Is Not Enough is a first-person shooter {{based on}} MGM's 1999 James Bond {{film of the}} same name, where the player assumes the role of James Bond through 14 {{missions}} with three difficulty settings. The player {{has the ability to}} run, jump, crouch, swim and dive underwater {{for a short period of}} time. One mission is played as a rail shooter in which the player skis down a mountain. In each mission, the player must complete a number of objectives while defeating enemies controlled by the game's artificial intelligence. Objectives range from rescuing hostages to destroying vehicles and collecting items. Some objectives require the player to use numerous high-tech gadgets. For example, the <b>Keypad</b> Decrypter can be used to decode lock systems, while the ID scanner is useful to copy fingerprints.|$|E

25|$|Numeric {{keyboards}} contain only numbers, mathematical symbols for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, a decimal point, {{and several}} function keys. They {{are often used}} to facilitate data entry with smaller keyboards {{that do not have}} a numeric <b>keypad,</b> commonly those of laptop computers. These keys are collectively known as a numeric pad, numeric keys, or a numeric <b>keypad,</b> and it can consist of the following types of keys: Arithmetic operators, numbers, arrow keys, Navigation keys, Num Lock and Enter key.|$|E
25|$|The EV-1 did {{not include}} a key to unlock and lock the vehicle, though one could be {{provided}} if the driver required one. To unlock or lock the car, you entered a personal identification number (PIN) on a <b>keypad</b> in the driver's side door, similar to that of Ford's Securicode system. Once inside, to start the car, no key was needed, nor was there a key slot. In the center console, there was a <b>keypad</b> on which the driver again entered the PIN to start the vehicle.|$|E
25|$|The Iomega TV with Boxee also {{ships with}} a similar small two-sided RF remote control with 4-way D-pad {{navigation}} and full a QWERTY <b>keypad</b> as standard.|$|E

40|$|<b>Keypads</b> are {{commonly}} used to enter personal identification numbers (PIN) which are intended to authenticate a user {{based on what they}} know. A number of those <b>keypads</b> such as ATM inputs and door <b>keypads</b> provide an audio feedback to the user for each button pressed. Such audio feedback are observable from a modest distance. We are looking at quantifying the information leaking from delays between acoustic feedback pulses. Preliminary experiments suggest that by using a Hidden Markov Model, {{it might be possible to}} substantially narrow the search space. A subsequentbrute force search on the reduced search space could be possible without triggering alerts, lockouts or other mechanisms design to thwart plain brute force attempts...|$|R
