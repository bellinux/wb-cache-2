50|$|The low clock {{frequency}} moderated the speed requirement {{of memory and}} peripherals attached to the CPU, as only about 50 percent of the clock cycle was available for memory access (due to the asynchronous design, this percentage varied strongly among chip versions). This was critical {{at a time when}} affordable memory had access times in the range 250 - 450 ns. The original NMOS 6502 was minimalistically engineered and <b>efficiently</b> <b>manufactured</b> and therefore cheap - an important factor in getting design wins in the very price-sensitive game console and home computer markets.Like its precursor, the Motorola 6800, the 6502 has very few registers. At the time the processor was designed, the number of transistors that could be economically put on a chip was very constrained (around a few thousand), so it made sense to rely on RAM instead of allocating expensive NMOS chip area for CPU registers. To this end, the CPU includes a 'zero-page' addressing mode that uses one address byte in the instruction instead of the two needed to address the full 64 KB of memory. This provides fast access to the first 256 bytes of RAM by using shorter instructions. Chuck Peddle has said in interviews that the specific intention was to allow these first 256 bytes of RAM to be used like registers.|$|E

The paper discusses additional benefits of the two new methods in enabling new gear design strategies and efficient machining of special gear forms.

50|$|The {{window of}} {{economic}} advantage in metal injection molded parts lies in complexity and volume for small-size parts. MIM materials {{are comparable to}} metal formed by competing methods, and final products are used in {{a broad range of}} industrial, commercial, medical, dental, firearms, aerospace, and automotive applications. Dimensional tolerances of ±0.3% are common and machining is required for closer tolerances. MIM can produce parts where it is difficult, or even impossible, to <b>efficiently</b> <b>manufacture</b> an item through other means of fabrication. Ideally, at least 75 dimensional specifications in a component of just 25 mm maximum size and 10 g mass is best - as for example required for watch cases, cellular telephone plugs, and laptop computer hinges. Increased costs for traditional manufacturing methods inherent to part complexity, such as internal/external threads, miniaturization, or identity marking, typically do not increase the cost in a MIM operation due to the flexibility of injection molding.|$|R

40|$|Glutamic acid is a {{promising}} renewable platform molecule which is abundantly available in biomass waste streams; {{it is also}} <b>efficiently</b> <b>manufactured</b> by fermentation. Here we report the reductive deamination of glutamic acid to bio-based dimethyl glutarate and methylamines. In order to recycle nitrogen in an industrially relevant co-product, glutamic acid was modified to N,N-dimethylglutamic acid by a mild reductive alkylation with Pd/C. Subsequently, selective C–N hydrogenolysis in methanol resulted in dimethyl glutarate and trimethylamine. A wide screening of transition metals (Pt, Pd, Rh and Ru) immobilized on various supports showed that the highest yields of dimethyl glutarate were obtained with Pt/TiO 2. An FTIR study and kinetic experiments on metal-loaded and unloaded supports demonstrate that the interplay between the metal and the moderate acidity of the support results in the excellent C–N hydrogenolysis activity and selectivity. Finally, reaction parameter optimization resulted in 81 % yield of dimethyl glutarate with 1 wt% Pt/TiO 2 at 225 °C, 30 bar H 2 after 8 h. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new production method for carbon fibre reinforced airframe structures (CFRP). The manufacturing process of CFRP structures {{is the basic}} element to control the success and cost of a composite component. Unfortunately highest structural performance will often not be achieved along with low manufacturing costs producing a CFRP assembly in a single manufacturing system (pure Prepreg or pure liquid Resin Infusion LRI). In large assemblies such as stringer stiffened panels geometric simple but heavy loaded components may be preferably layed up by automated Prepreg tape laying systems. More complex components such as stringers or frames can be cost <b>efficiently</b> <b>manufactured</b> in LRI processes. Due to similar infusion cycles and/or cure cycles of prepreg and LRI processes the next step for reducing the production costs is to use an integral process for integral structures, the so called hybrid fabrication route. This hybrid fabrication route {{is based on the}} combination of the two industrially well established production methods: the Prepreg- and the LRI Technology. This technology comprises both, maximum structural performance and low manufacturing cost for large integral airframe structures. For a fundamental assessment of this new procedure numerous experimental investigations were carried out referring mainly to the characterisation of the contact zone which is formed in the considered case of two-matrix materials. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} years, {{freeform}} architecture {{became more and}} more popular. A variety of complex geometric shapes are used for the facades of buildings. Because of the large scale of architecture, it is necessary to decompose the surface into small panels. Here mathematics comes into play: In discrete differential geometry, presently emerging on the border between differential and discrete geometry, one aims to discretize smooth surfaces and the methods of differential geometry. This knowledge helps to <b>efficiently</b> design and <b>manufacture</b> freeform surfaces. A natural discretization is to cover the freeform surface by planar panel elements, leading to meshes with planar faces. It turns out that triangular meshes cause problems in the architectural realization when a support structure consisting of beams is needed. These beams cross each other in nodes, which are difficult to manufacture if the nodes have torsion, i. e. if the symmetry planes of the beams do not intersect in a common axis. In general, nodes of triangle meshes have torsion, in contrast to preferred planar quadrilateral meshes. Also, quadrilateral meshes do allow multilayer constructions often used in steel-glass constructions. Mathematically, multilayer constructions are described by edge-parallel meshes. A class of meshes with torsion-free nodes and equally-spaced parallel meshes are conical meshes. Equivalently, the faces adjacent to a node are tangent to a right circular cone. Any such mesh is parallel to a mesh whose faces are tangent to a sphere. If and only if the polar dual of the latter is discreteisothermic, the conical mesh has equilibrium forces. For this, one imagines the external forces acting in the nodes...|$|R
40|$|A {{turbulent}} environment enormously {{affects a}} companies manufacturing. Due to continuous changes of {{external and internal}} factors, the production has to be continuously adapted, to ensure econonmic operation. New as well as old products have to be <b>manufactured</b> <b>efficiently.</b> Short term planning and improvements do not always cope with this challenge. No matter how fast the system can respond, there are always long term considerations to be made. Besides short-term improvements and incremental adaptations, a systematic preview is necessary, for example when dealing with the integration of new technologies or with structural tasks such as {{the definition of the}} range of vertical integration. Thus, to ensure strategic flexibility in a turbulent environment, modern strategic production planning has to provide alternative strategies to achieve the required performance. Their commercial effects as well as possible consequences with respect to transformability must be taken into account. Furthermore, modern strategic production planning must support the management in deducing activities and investments required. The goal of this thesis therefore is to improve the long-term design of production in a turbulent environment. This will is accomplished by developing a method for strategic performance planning in transformable production structures. The method addresses small and medium sized enterprises doing business in mechanical engineering. Influences considered are variances of the output quantity structure of parts, continuous and discontinuous changes of products and production technologies, and changes of vertical integration. The scope is limited to a single site of an enterprise and considers a strategic time frame of up to ten years.
