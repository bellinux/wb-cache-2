40|$|We analyze one {{frequently}} used clause in public bonds called covenant defeasance. Covenant defeasance allows the bond issuer {{to remove all}} of the bond's covenants by placing the remaining outstanding payments with a trustee in an escrow account to be paid out on schedule. Bond covenants are predominantly noncontingent, action-limiting covenants. By giving the issuer an option to remove covenants, noncontingent control rights can be made state-contingent even when no interim signals are available. We provide a theoretical justi cation for covenant <b>defeasance</b> <b>and</b> show empirically that such a clause allows {{for the inclusion of}} more covenants in public bond issues. In line with the model's prediction, our empirical analysis documents a 13 - 25 basis points premium for defeasible bonds. This premium amounts to an annual saving of about $ 1 m per year, or $ 11 m over the lifetime of an average bond. Bonds; Covenants; Defeasance; Renegotiation...|$|R

40|$|In {{the current}} global {{financial}} crisis, economists and policymakers have reembraced Big Government {{as a means}} of preventing the reoccurrence of a debt-deflation depression. The danger, however, is that policy may not downsize finance and replace money manager capitalism. According to Senior Scholar L. Randall Wray, we need a permanently larger fiscal presence, with more public services. His advice to President Obama is to discard all of former Treasury Secretary Paulson's actions. Wray believes that we can afford any necessary spending <b>and</b> <b>bailouts,</b> <b>and</b> that these actions will not burden our grandchildren. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} effects of {{regulatory}} interventions <b>and</b> capital support (<b>bailouts)</b> on banks’ liquidity creation. We rely on instrumental variables to deal with possible endogeneity concerns. Our key findings, which are based on a unique supervisory German dataset, are that regulatory interventions robustly trigger decreases in liquidity creation, while capital support does not affect liquidity creation. Additional results include {{the effects of}} these actions on different components of liquidity creation, lending, and risk taking. Our findings provide new and important insights into the debates about the design of regulatory interventions <b>and</b> <b>bailouts...</b>|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims {{to examine}} the {{exercise}} of covenant defeasance options. To find what bonds are defeased, we build a SEC crawler to analyze more than 1. 4 m SEC filings. Our methods of analysis are descriptive statistics and regression analysis. The regression analysis is performed by joining our data with Mergent’s Fixed Income Securities Database (FISD). Our major findings are: (1) 0. 56 % of defeasible bonds have this option exercised; (2) <b>defeasance</b> <b>and</b> repurchase are linked together as firms often repurchase as many bonds as possible while any hold outs are removed via defeasance; (3) no evidence that defeasance exercise is clustered in industries with higher uncertainty (4) bonds with a higher number of restrictive covenants {{are more likely to}} exercise their defeasance option; (5) {{there is no indication that}} callable bonds substitute for defeasance exercise; (6) the defeasance exercises are often linked to major corporate actions, such as acquisitions, mergers or refinancing. nhhma...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a simple dynamic {{general equilibrium model}} of an agricultural economy, in which poor farmers borrow wheat from rich farmers to invest in their land. Since wheat output is stochastic (we allow for both idiosynchratic and aggregate shocks) there may be default ex-post. The main thrust of the paper is to compare equilibria in this economy with and without political intervention. This intervention is decided through majority voting and can {{take the form of}} a bailout or a moratorium. The results of our formal analysis are confronted with historial evidence from the Panic of 1819 in the U. S. With no aggregate uncertainty, the main results of the formal analysis are that allowing for debt moratoria <b>and</b> <b>bailouts</b> not only always improves ex-post efficiency but may improve ex-ante efficiency. Anticipated bailouts always occur in equilibrium and moratoria never occur, but the threat of moratoria enhances efficiency. With aggregate uncertainty, the differences between moratoria <b>and</b> <b>bailouts</b> may collapse, with both occurring only in bad times and improving ex-ante efficiency. ...|$|R

The CBO reported that the deficit expansion was mainly due to the economic downturn rather than policy choices.

The demise <b>and</b> <b>bailout</b> of Bear Stearns was due in-part to its role in these derivatives.|$|R
