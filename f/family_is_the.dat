5|$|A320 Enhanced family (or A320E <b>family)</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> working {{title for}} a series of {{improvements}} to the A320 family.

5|$|The Airbus A320 {{family are}} narrow-body (single-aisle) {{aircraft}} with a retractable {{tricycle landing gear}} and are powered by two wing pylon-mounted turbofan engines. The Airbus A320 <b>family</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> only narrow-body aircraft from Airbus.|$|E
5|$|<b>Family</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> primary {{social and}} {{political}} grouping in Torajan society. Each village is one extended family, the seat {{of which is the}} tongkonan, a traditional Torajan house. Each tongkonan has a name, which becomes the name of the village. The familial dons maintain village unity. Marriage between distant cousins (fourth cousins and beyond) is a common practice that strengthens kinship. Toraja society prohibits marriage between close cousins (up to and including the third cousin)—except for nobles, to prevent the dispersal of property. Kinship is actively reciprocal, meaning that the extended family helps each other farm, share buffalo rituals, and pay off debts.|$|E
50|$|Csaroda and its {{vicinity}} {{was mentioned}} first in written form in 1299. Its name {{came from the}} river name Csernavoda (Black water) where it <b>is</b> setting. In <b>the</b> 13th century <b>the</b> Káta <b>family</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> landowner of the village. In the 14th century <b>the</b> Csaroda <b>family</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> landowner, a leading family of Bereg county. In 1446 Vetési family, from 1461 to 1476 the Tegzes, Drágfy, Daróczy and Újhelyi <b>families</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> landowners, later the Lónyai, Rédey and Bay family, finally the Teleky counts.|$|R

5|$|Indian women {{negotiate}} survival {{through an}} array of oppressive patriarchal family structures: age, ordinal status, relationship to men through family of origin, marriage and procreation as well as patriarchal attributes. Examples of patriarchal attributes include: dowry, siring sons etc., kinship, caste, community, village, market and the state. It should however be noted that several communities in India, such as the Nairs of Kerala, Shettys of Mangalore, certain Maratha clans, and Bengali families exhibit matriarchal tendencies. In these communities, {{the head of the}} <b>family</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> oldest woman rather than the oldest man. Sikh culture is also regarded as relatively gender-neutral.|$|E
5|$|Mantises are {{an order}} (Mantodea) of insects that {{contains}} over 2,400 species in about 430 genera in 15 families. The largest <b>family</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Mantidae ("mantids"). Mantises are distributed worldwide in temperate and tropical habitats. They have triangular heads with bulging eyes supported on flexible necks. Their elongated bodies {{may or may}} not have wings, but all Mantodea have forelegs that are greatly enlarged and adapted for catching and gripping prey; their upright posture, while remaining stationary with forearms folded, has led to the common name praying mantis.|$|E
5|$|The Doni Tondo or Doni Madonna, {{sometimes}} called The Holy <b>Family,</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> only finished panel painting by the mature Michelangelo to survive. Now in the Uffizi in Florence, Italy, {{and still in}} its original frame, the painting was probably commissioned by Agnolo Doni to commemorate his marriage to Maddalena Strozzi, {{the daughter of a}} powerful Tuscan family. The painting {{is in the form of}} a tondo, or round frame, which is frequently associated during the Renaissance with domestic ideas.|$|E

5|$|The huia {{appears to}} be a remnant of an early {{expansion}} of passerines in the country of New Zealand, and is the largest of the three members of the family Callaeidae, the New Zealand wattlebirds; the others are the saddleback and the kōkako. The only close relative to the <b>family</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> stitchbird; their taxonomic relationships to other birds remain to be determined. A molecular study of the nuclear RAG-1 and c-mos genes of the three species within the family proved inconclusive, the data providing most support for either a basally diverging kōkako or huia.|$|E
5|$|Languages evolve and diversify over time, and {{the history}} of their {{evolution}} can be reconstructed by comparing modern languages to determine which traits their ancestral languages must have had in order for the later developmental stages to occur. A group of languages that descend from a common ancestor is known as a language family. The Indo-European <b>family</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> most widely spoken and includes languages as diverse as English, Russian and Hindi; the Sino-Tibetan family, which includes Mandarin, Bodo and the other Chinese languages, and Tibetan; the Afro-Asiatic family, which includes Arabic, Somali, and Hebrew; the Bantu languages, which include Swahili, and Zulu, and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout Africa; and the Malayo-Polynesian languages, which include Indonesian, Malay, Tagalog, and hundreds of other languages spoken throughout the Pacific. The languages of the Dravidian family that are spoken mostly in Southern India include Tamil and Telugu. Academic consensus holds that between 50% and 90% of languages spoken {{at the beginning of the}} 21st century will probably have become extinct by the year 2100.|$|E
25|$|The regular simplex <b>family</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{first of}} three regular polytope families, labeled by Coxeter as αn, the other two being the cross-polytope family, labeled as βn, and the hypercubes, labeled as γn. A fourth family, the {{infinite}} tessellation of hypercubes, he labeled as δn.|$|E

25|$|The <b>family</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{agent to}} which {{capitalist}} production delegates the psychological {{repression of the}} desires of the child. Psychological repression is distinguished from social oppression insofar as it works unconsciously. Through it, Deleuze and Guattari argue, parents transmit their angst and irrational fears to their child and bind the child's sexual desires to feelings of shame and guilt.|$|E
25|$|Some {{newly married}} brides suffer {{domestic}} {{violence in the}} form of harassment, physical abuse or death when she is thought to have not brought enough dowry with marriage. Some cases end up in suicides by hanging, self-poisoning or by fire. In dowry deaths, the groom’s <b>family</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> perpetrator of murder or suicide.|$|E

25|$|The consanguine <b>family</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{first stage}} {{of the family and}} as such a primary {{indicator}} of our superior nature in comparison with animals. In this state marriage groups are separated according to generations. The husband and wife relationship is immediately and communally assumed between the male and female members of one generation. The only taboo is a sexual relationship between two generations (i.e. father and daughter, grandmother and grandson).|$|E
25|$|Both {{saturated}} (alicyclic) {{compounds and}} unsaturated compounds exist as cyclic derivatives. The most stable rings contain {{five or six}} carbon atoms, but large rings (macrocycles) and smaller rings are common. The smallest cycloalkane <b>family</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> three-membered cyclopropane ((CH2)3). Saturated cyclic compounds contain single bonds only, whereas aromatic rings have an alternating (or conjugated) double bond. Cycloalkanes do not contain multiple bonds, whereas the cycloalkenes and the cycloalkynes do.|$|E
