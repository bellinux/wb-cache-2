5000|$|The {{present value}} of the minimum lease {{payments}} (MLP) is {{equal to or greater}} than 90% of the fair market value of leased property. To understand and apply this criterion, you need familiarize yourself with what is included in the minimum lease payments and how the present value is calculated. The minimum lease payments include the minimum rental payments minus any executory cost, the <b>guaranteed</b> <b>residual</b> <b>value,</b> the bargain purchase option, and any penalty for failure to renew or extend the lease. The amount calculated is then discounted using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate. However, if the lessee knows the implicit rate used by the lessor and the rate is less than the lessee’s rate, the lessee should use the lessor’s rate to discount the minimum lease payment.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine <b>residual</b> <b>value</b> risk {{modelling}} issues with a focus on automotive lease portfolios. <b>Residual</b> <b>value</b> risk is approached through a re-sampling technique that provides the probability density function of losses and VaR measures for credit portfolios. Design/methodology/approach – The methodology is applied to a portfolio of 37, 523 operating leases issued between 1989 and 2001 by a major European financial institution. Findings – The results show that <b>residual</b> <b>value</b> losses are low and sometimes non-existent. Moreover, the major part of <b>residual</b> <b>value</b> risk is idiosyncratic and can thus be eliminated through adequate diversification. Additionally, this internal model seems to prove that capital requirements stemming from the Basel Committee's proposed new framework are somehow overestimated. Originality/value – This paper advocates determining a more accurate risk weight for <b>residual</b> <b>value</b> risk in order to better reflect this relatively low-risk part of leasing activities.

Probability density function of losses and Value-at-risk measures are estimated {{on the basis of a}} private database comprising a unique set of 4828 individual automotive lease contracts issued between 1990 and 2001 by a major European financial institution. Then, a discussion is led in relation to the capital requirements related to <b>residual</b> <b>value</b> risk stemming from the Basel II Accord. As the greatest part of recovery risk is diversifiable, our conclusion is that a wider recognition of physical collateral in capital adequacy regulations should allow us to better reflect the relatively low-risk profile of automotive lease exposures. leasing, <b>residual</b> <b>value</b> risk, loss given default (LGD), Basel II Accord,...|$|R

To make the right decisions on equipment repair, rebuilding, disposal, or equipment fleet optimization to maximize the return of investment, the contractors need to predict the <b>residual</b> <b>value</b> of heavy construction equipment to an acceptable level of accuracy.

40|$|Die vorliegende Arbeit beschäftigt sich mit der Risikostruktur in Leasingverträgen und versucht damit Einblicke und Handlungsempfehlungen für das Risikomanagement von Leasingfirmen zu geben. Der Fokus liegt dabei auf einer besonderen und wichtigen Risikoart in eben diesen Verträgen, dem sogenannten Restwertrisiko. Dieses beschreibt das Risiko der Abweichung des vertraglich festgelegten Restwertes vom tatsächlichen Wert des Leasingobjektes am Ende der Vertragslaufzeit. Meine Untersuchung beschäftigt sich dabei mit Automobilleasing, das den größten Anteil am Leasingmarkt besitzt. Das Ziel der Arbeit ist die Untersuchung der folgenden zwei Forschungsfragen: 1.) 	Welche Faktoren beeinflussen in welcher Weise den Restwert? 2.) 	Wie lassen sich Restwerte voraussagen? Zum einen ist ein Mindestmaß an Berechenbarkeit notwendig, um das Restwertrisiko managen zu können. Daher ist eine Identifikation von Einflussfaktoren von Restwerten von großer Wichtigkeit. So lassen sich Schwankungen in den Restwerten auf Veränderungen in den beeinflussenden Variablen zurückführen, wodurch der Werteverlauf des Fahrzeuges von dem Werteverlauf der Einflussfaktoren abgeleitet werden kann. Zum anderen sind Restwerte nicht vorab bekannt, werden jedoch beim Abschluss eines Leasingvertrages benötigt. Aus diesem Grund müssen Restwerte prognostiziert werden. Beide Fragen werden mit Hilfe einer empirischen Untersuchung auf Basis einer ARIMAX-Regression untersucht. Hierfür wird ein Datensatz bestehend aus monatlichen Restwerten von 17 Fahrzeugen des deutschen Automobilmarktes im Untersuchungszeitraum von Juni 1992 bis Dezember 2008 verwendet. Die Einflussfaktoren der Restwerte beschreiben die Marktumgebung dieser Fahrzeuge. Diese lassen sich in drei Kategorien einteilen, wobei die erste Kategorie die gesamtwirtschaftliche Lage, die zweite die Situation auf dem Neu- und Gebrauchtwagenmarkt und die dritte die Charakteristika eines bestimmten Fahrzeuges beschreiben. Die empirischen Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die gewählten Faktoren einen Einfluss auf die Restwerte von Fahrzeugen haben. Darüberhinaus lassen sich mit der Hilfe der Einflussfaktoren Fahrzeugrestwerte sehr genau vorhersagen, was zu einer guten Vorhersagefähigkeit führt. Zusätzlich werden die empirischen Ergebnisse und Überlegungen verwendet, um Implikationen für das Risikomanagement von Leasingfirmen theoretisch zu untersuchen. Dazu wird das Bewertungsmodell von McConnell und Schallheim (1983) herangezogen, um zum einen die Auswirkungen v on Schwankungen in einem der zugrundeliegenden Faktoren auf die Leasingrate zu quantifizieren und zum anderen, um die Auswirkungen von Fehlspezifikationen einer der beeinflussenden Faktoren auf die Leasingrate und den Wert des Leasingvertrages zu bestimmen. Die theoretischen Überlegungen geben Einblicke und Handlungsempfehlungen, um das Restwertrisikomanagement für Leasingverträge zu verbessern. The work at hand {{concentrates}} on the risk structure of lease contracts and therefore aims to give insights and support to the risk management of lease firms. The focus lies on a special and highly important type of risk in such contracts named <b>residual</b> <b>value</b> risk describing the risk arising from deviations of the actual <b>residual</b> <b>value</b> at maturity stage of the contract from the estimated one fixed in the contract at its completion. My analysis deals with automobile leases covering the major share of this market. The main objective of this work is the analysis of two research question: 1.) What determines <b>residual</b> <b>values?</b> 2.) How can <b>residual</b> <b>values</b> be predicted? On the one hand, a minimum level of predictability is necessary to manage <b>residual</b> <b>value</b> risk. That is why an identification of determinants of <b>residual</b> <b>values</b> is extremely important. The possibility to link fluctuations in <b>residual</b> <b>values</b> to changes in explanatory variables allows one to trace the pattern of <b>residual</b> <b>values</b> based on {{the pattern of the}} identified risk factors. On the other hand, <b>residual</b> <b>values</b> are not known in advance but needed at the completion of the lease contract. This is why <b>residual</b> <b>values</b> have to be predicted. These questions are assessed by an empirical analysis using the ARIMAX regression methodology. The analysis uses a sample covering monthly <b>residual</b> <b>values</b> of 17 cars in the German automobile market for the observation period from June 1992 to December 2008. The determinants of the <b>residual</b> <b>values</b> describe the market environment of used cars. Those can be classified into three man categories. The first one illustrates the overall economic situation, the second one describes the situation in the new and used car market and the third one specifies a certain car model in more detail. The empirical results give evidence that the chosen factors influence the <b>residual</b> <b>values</b> of cars. Moreover, those determinants lead to very accurate predicted <b>residual</b> <b>values</b> showing a high forecast ability. Furthermore, the empirical results and considerations are used to conduct a theoretical analysis in order to derive implications for the <b>residual</b> <b>value</b> risk management. The valuation model of McConnell and Schallheim (1983) is used on the one hand to quantify the impact of fluctuations in the underlying factors on the lease rate and, on the other hand, to analyse the effects of misspecifications in an underlying market factor on the lease rate and the value of the lease contract. These theoretical considerations give insights and support to improve the risk management of <b>residual</b> <b>values</b> in lease contracts...|$|R

Ioan Trenca. An increasing debate is rising recently between the academic community, the business community, the private lending institutions(banks, investment funds, etc.) and the officials of the Romanian Government and of the European Union regarding the proposed method for calculation of the <b>residual</b> <b>value</b> in the European financed investment projects. Several methods of calculation of the <b>Residual</b> <b>Value</b> were taken into consideration and contested by different parties in order to prepare and to submit financial analysis studies for investment projects proposed to be financed within the European Regional Development Fund(ERDF). In this context, the present paper proposes to address the three main methods of calculation of the <b>residual</b> <b>value</b> and later to study its impact over the indicators, especially over the Internal Rate of Return, obtained in the financial analysis for an investment project proposed by a Romanian medium sized company. In order to establish the proper method which {{should be used for}} selection and calculation of the <b>residual</b> <b>value</b> previously published studies and official documentations were analyzed. The main methods for calculation of the <b>residual</b> <b>values</b> were identified as being the following: A. the <b>residual</b> market <b>value</b> of fixed assets, as if it were to be sold, B. accounting economic depreciation formula and C. by using the net present value of the cash flows. Based on these methods the research model was elaborated, and using the financial data of the proposed infrastructure investment was created a case study. According to the realized study a pattern was established for proper determination of <b>residual</b> <b>value</b> and for determination of IRR and methods A and C were proposed to be used. This paper tries to analyze a specific problem of the Romanian enterprises which access European funding, so it can be further used to improve the current methodology of the ERDF programme in Romania: Sectorial Operational Programme "Increase of Economic Competitiveness".
