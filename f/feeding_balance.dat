Immunosupression {{can be caused}} by infectious agents, improper <b>feeding</b> <b>balance</b> (deficiencies), lack of biosecurity, management failures, stress or by a combination of these factors. Each of these possible causes must be seriously worked out to prevent the consequences of immunosupression on profitability. Environmental factors and numerous infectious pathogens have been identified as a multi-factorial cause of various degrees of immunosupression. Mainly subclinical character and coinfections make the diagnosis of the primary immunosuppressive agents difficult. On the other hand, early diagnosis and identification of contributing factors are important to develop strategies to fight immunosupression in birds successfully. A combination of biosecurity measures, optimized housing condition and stress reduction together with appropriate vaccination strategies is necessary for the successful control of immunosupression in commercial poultry...|$|E

The area of the unit is 47 ha, of which 42 ha were dedicated to grazing, divided into 37 paddocks, and the other 5 were used for forage production from sugarcane. The stocking rate was 1, 7 cows/ha. The body condition (BC) of the heifers at parturition was monitored, the live weight of the animals was estimated, the <b>feeding</b> <b>balance</b> for the nine months-pregnant cows was calculated and the reproductive indicators were determined. A slight energy deficiency of 5 % was found only in the dry season, while there was excess of crude protein, calcium and phosphorus in both seasons. The BC of the heifers at parturition was above 3 in all the two-month periods of the year, with the highest values in July-August (3, 5) and the lowest in May-June (3, 1); besides, in both seasons the average BC of the animals was similar (3, 3). The weight of the calves at birth did not show differences for the different ranges of BC and it was between 36, 5 and 38, 7 kg/animal. The cows that gave birth with 2, 5 BC showed a parturition-first service interval (P< 0, 05) and parturition-pregnancy interval (P< 0, 01) significantly higher (170 and 258, respectively) than the ones that gave birth with a BC between 3 and 4 (90 - 125 and 120 - 175 for the parturition-first service (PSI) and parturition-pregnancy (PPI) intervals, respectively).

To overcome resource limitations, producers complement <b>balanced</b> <b>feed</b> with the leaves of tree spinach (Cnidoscolus chayamansa), a plant found in Yucatan, other parts of Mexico, Central and South America, Africa, Asia and Oceania.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine the role of livestock in smallholder mixed farming systems, and to determine variations in livestock inventory in relation to changes in socio-economic status and rural population density in the Harar Highlands of Ethiopia. Livestock <b>feed</b> <b>balance,</b> household food adequacy level, and soil humus balance of annually cropped plots were identified as proxy indicators of sustainability. The long-term dynamics of the crop-livestock sub-system within the evolving livelihood system was also examined. The study showed that farmers and experts differed in their views regarding livestock production objectives, constraints and development measures. Farmers in different well-being categories varied in their livestock inventories, showing differences in their production strategies and needs. Only poor farmers had enough feed to meet maintenance requirement of their livestock while others were largely deficit. <b>Feed</b> <b>balance</b> results failed to portray field reality, as knowledge about tropical feeds and the adaptive potentials of indigenous breeds is limited, undermining the potential use of <b>feed</b> <b>balance</b> as an indicator of sustainability of smallholder mixed farms. Both household energy adequacy levels and the per cent contribution of livestock to total household energy supply varied significantly with well-being categories. Households in medium and well-to-do categories were high in household energy adequacy levels whereas poor households could not meet their energy demands. Also, the estimated soil humus balances of annually cropped plots of poor households were negative whereas those of other farmers were positive, and values increased with higher livestock holding. The variations across districts and across well-being categories were highly significant. Livestock inventory declined with rural population density and increased with socio-economic status, and variations were significant. But the number of livestock per unit area of cultivated land increased significantly with rural population density. The number and overall transport performance of dondeys increased significantly with socio-economic status, indicating the growing importance of non-agricultural activities and signalling a change in livelihood systems and the functions of livestock. The trend and dynamics of the crop-livestock sub-system was also studied, using system dynamics modelling. Complementary and competitive relations among sub-system components were depicted, the critical role of livestock in the livelihood system illustrated, and a conceptual model framework containing key elements and flows developed. As the role of livestock in the livelihood systems remains central, the focus of technology choice and promotion has to shift from crop or livestock to crop and livestock production system. The thesis that as land resources dwindle mixed farming systems will have to specialize or would face involution, does not seem to hold for the Harar Highlands of Ethiopia, at least in the foreseeable future.

40|$|A {{central concern}} of the Grain & Graze research, {{development}} and extension program has been improving {{the management of the}} feedbase on mixed farms through addressing ‘feed gaps’ – times of year during which the supply of forage is insufficient to meet livestock demand. In this review,weuse the available data on pasture growth and quality, supplemented by modelling results, to describe the characteristic timing of feed gaps across the Australian cereal-livestock zone. Feedbase interventions studied during the Grain & Graze program have mainly addressed the supply side of the <b>feed</b> <b>balance</b> equation. We review these studies, paying particular attention to the time scale of the variability in the <b>feed</b> <b>balance</b> that each intervention is intended to address. We conclude that grazing of cereals (either dual-purpose or forage crops) is the most promising means of alleviating winter feed gaps in regions where they are important. Reducing feed gaps in summer by relying on unpredictable summer rainfall events will increase year-to-year variability in forage production and will therefore require moreflexible livestock management systems to exploit it. The use of forage shrubs offers a practical tool for increasing the predictability of summer and autumn feed supply, but given their moderate capacity for providing additional metabolisable energy it remains important to carefully manage livestock over autumn and to manage the herbaceous inter-row pasture. Feed gaps mainly arise from an interaction between biology and economics. Wefind, however, that the options studied in the Grain&Graze program for addressing feed gaps require either greater complexity in pasture and grazing management or more opportunistic livestock trading; they therefore comeat a cost to the manager’s limited decision-making time. Times with feed gaps are also times when particular natural resource management risks (especially erosion) need to be managed. Supplyside interventions to relieve feed gaps will generally use more soil water, which will often have positive effects on natural resource management outcomes. Andrew D. Moore, Lindsay W.

The location of the step transition along the axis of the balun and the diameter change are two dimensional parameters that are not present in the conventional split coaxial balun. These additional parameters, together with the double slot width, provide more flexibility to design the balun for better impedance matching. The effects of the three dimensional parameters on the input impedance seen at the (unbalanced) coaxial line side of the balun are investigated when it is terminated with specific lumped impedance at its (balanced) split side.

It is possible to state that the analysed farms are inefficient in utilization of inputs for the given level of output. The TE value was statistically significantly influenced by the feed costs only. The negative influence of this factor indicates inefficient utilization of <b>feeds</b> (<b>balance</b> of <b>feeding</b> ration, losses of storage, reciprocal substitution of feeds) or inefficient utilization of its production potential in relation to the given output level...|$|R
40|$|The {{original}} contribution to knowledge made by this research work is demonstrating {{the benefits of}} differentially fed balanced transmit antenna in modern communication system. Extensive experimental studies have established {{the fact that a}} true differential amplifier <b>feeding</b> a <b>balanced</b> antenna offers higher linearity and lower distortions compared to the single ended feeding technique, even while using the same amplifier. With continuing advancements in personal communications in this era of digital economy, the demand for wireless connectivity has grown radically, resulting in stringent performance requirement for RF components. Differential circuits are preferred choice in RFIC design due to its good noise immunity and low distortion characteristics. But it is observed that single ended PAs and LNAs are used for the feeding part because of the antenna industry’s tendency to stick to conventional 50 Ω interface. Therefore, differentially fed transmit balanced antenna is an area of current research, which has been studied in this thesis. The study was set out with a review of the state-of-the-art in active integrated antennas. Following that, the ground plane influence on antenna radiation pattern was explored and novel techniques to compensate the effects were presented. It was observed that the current flow in a coaxial cable also affects radiation pattern. Hence, a novel method was proposed to measure wireless devices in the anechoic chamber eradicating the need of any cable attachments. Broadband differential amplifiers were then reviewed with a view to <b>feed</b> <b>balanced</b> and unbalanced antennas for demonstrating the potential of differential feeding technique over the conventional one. The amplifier with differential output interface exhibited higher gain and linearity in both bench test and radiated power test. Further improvement in linearity was reported by lowering the output resistance of the amplifier. Afterwards, a broadband antenna with stable radiation pattern and impedance was designed to carry out radiated harmonic measurements, which illustrated that the fully differential output configuration possesses significantly lower harmonic distortion. All these measurement results have suggested that balanced antenna fed by differential amplifier can be the best solution for applications demanding higher output power, greater linearity and lower distortion. Therefore it is recommended to re-evaluate the idea of power amplifier and antenna interface in RF front-end designs...|$|R

A wideband coplanar waveguide (CPW) to coplanar stripline (CPS) transition {{is used to}} <b>feed</b> the <b>balanced</b> printed dipole. Two silicon photo switches are placed on small gaps in both dipole arms equidistant from the centre feed. Light from two infra-red laser diodes channelled through fibre optic cables {{is applied to the}} switches. With the gaps in the dipole bridged, the antenna resonates at a lower frequency. Measured return loss results that compare well to the simulated values are also presented, showing a frequency shift of nearly 40...|$|R
5000|$|Audio {{transformers}} {{were originally}} designed to connect different telephone systems to one another while keeping their respective power supplies isolated, and are still commonly used to interconnect professional audio systems or system components, to eliminate buzz and hum. Such transformers typically have a 1:1 ratio between the primary and the secondary. These {{can also be used}} for splitting signals, balancing unbalanced signals, or <b>feeding</b> a <b>balanced</b> signal to unbalanced equipment. Transformers are also used in DI boxes to convert high-impedance instrument signals (e.g., bass guitar) to low impedance signals to enable them to connect to a microphone input on the mixing console.|$|R
