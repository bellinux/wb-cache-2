25|$|A big man, {{standing}} {{six feet}} three <b>inches</b> <b>or</b> 1.90 metres tall, Eady was an all-rounder: a hard-hitting right-handed batsman and a right-arm fast bowler. He made 116 and 112 not out for Tasmania against Victoria in 1895 and was picked {{for the tour}} to England in 1896. But he failed to do himself justice, scoring just 12 runs in the Lord's Test match, though he picked up four fairly cheap wickets. He made one more Test appearance in 1901-2, again with little success.|$|E
25|$|The {{telescope}} at New Berlin Observatory (1835–1913), that discovered Neptune, was an achromatic refractor of 9 Paris inch (9.6 English <b>inches</b> <b>or</b> 24.4cm) aperture {{made by the}} late Joseph Fraunhofer's firm, Merz und Mahler. It was a high-performance telescope of its era, {{with one of the}} largest achromatic doublets available and a finely made equatorial mount, with a clockwork drive to move the 4 m (13.4′) main tube in time with Earth's rotation. Eventually the telescope was moved to the Deutsches Museum in Munich, Germany, where it can still be seen in the 21st century as an exhibit.|$|E

25|$|The {{concerns}} {{raised by}} the above may be addressed in part by use of the Clipped Tag. The Clipped Tag is an RFID tag designed to increase consumer privacy. The Clipped Tag has been suggested by IBM researchers Paul Moskowitz and Guenter Karjoth. After the point of sale, a consumer may tear off {{a portion of the}} tag. This allows the transformation of a long-range tag into a proximity tag that still may be read, but only at short range– less than a few <b>inches</b> <b>or</b> centimeters. The modification of the tag may be confirmed visually. The tag may still be used later for returns, recalls, or recycling.|$|E

She also adopted the severe powdered queue hairstyle of a professional soldier, although she stood out due to her short stature, under five French feet in her riding-boots (around 5 feet 4 <b>inches</b> <b>or</b> 160cm). The regiment was soon assigned to the Army of the Eastern Pyrenees for the campaign of 1793–94, where she saved the life of the grievously-wounded General Noguès, had two horses shot from under her, and refused a promotion to corporal.|$|E

25|$|In some contexts, {{especially}} in photography and astronomy, aperture {{refers to the}} diameter of the aperture stop rather than the physical stop or the opening itself. For example, in a telescope, the aperture stop is typically the edges of the objective lens or mirror (or of the mount that holds it). One then speaks of a telescope as having, for example, a 100-centimeter aperture. Note that the aperture stop is not necessarily the smallest stop in the system. Magnification and demagnification by lenses and other elements can cause a relatively large stop to be the aperture stop for the system. In astrophotography, the aperture may be given as a linear measure (for example in <b>inches</b> <b>or</b> mm) or as the dimensionless ratio between that measure and the focal length. In other photography, it is usually given as a ratio.|$|E
25|$|As an example, marlin lures are {{typically}} 7-14 <b>inches</b> <b>or</b> more long with a shaped plastic or metal {{head and a}} plastic skirt. The design of the lure head, particularly its face, gives the lure its individual action when trolled through the water. Lure actions range from an active side-to-side swimming pattern to pushing water aggressively on the surface to, most commonly, tracking along {{in a straight line}} with a regular surface pop and bubble trail. Besides the shape, weight and size of the lure head, the length and thickness of skirting, the number and size of hooks and the length and size of the leader used in lure rigging all influence the action of the lure: how actively it will run and how it will respond to different sea conditions. Experienced anglers fine tune their lures to get the action they want.|$|E
25|$|Ancistrus species {{show all}} the typical {{features}} of the Loricariidae. This includes a body covered in bony plates and a ventral suckermouth. The feature most commonly associated with the genus are the fleshy tentacles found on the head in adult males; females may possess tentacles along the snout margin but they are smaller and they lack tentacles on the head. Tentacules, tentacles directly associated with odontodes, develop on the pectoral fin spine of the males of some species. Males also have evertible cheek odontodes which are less developed or absent in females. They also lack odontodes along the snout. In comparison with a typical loricariid (pleco), a bristlenose is typically shorter (4–6 <b>inches</b> <b>or</b> 15cm or less), more flattened and fatter with a comparatively wider head. Colouration is typically mottled brown, grey or black. Small white or yellow spots are common. Unlike other loricariids which commonly grow to over a foot long, the bristlenose pleco may only grow to half the size, this makes it a suitable species for the smaller tank.|$|E

25|$|In 1950, the British Somaliland {{protectorate}} government commissioned {{an archaeological}} survey in twelve desert towns in present-day Somaliland, {{near the border}} with Ethiopia. According to the expedition team, the sites yielded the most salient evidence of late medieval period affluence. They contained ruins of what were evidently once large cities belonging to the Adal Sultanate. Three of the towns in particular, Abara, Gargesa and Amud, featured between 200 and 300 stone houses. The walls of certain sites still reportedly stood 18 meters high. Excavations in the area yielded 26 silver coins, unlike the copper pieces that were more common in polities below the Horn region. The earliest of these recovered coins had been minted by Sultan Barquq (1382–99), also of the Egyptian Burji dynasty, and the latest were again Sultan Qaitbay issues. All of the pieces had been struck in either Cairo or Damascus. A few gold coins were also discovered during the expedition, making the area {{the only place in}} the wider region to yield such pieces. Besides coinage, high quality porcelain was recovered from the Adal sites. The fine celadon ware was found either lying on the surface, or buried at a depth of seven and a half <b>inches,</b> <b>or</b> ensconced within dense middens four to five feet high. Among the artefacts were grey granular sherds with a crackled blue-green or sea-green glaze, and white crystalline fragments with an uncrackled green-white glaze. Some Ming dynasty ware was also discovered, including many early Ming blue-and-white bowl sherds. They were adorned with tendril scrolls on a bluish ground and ornamented with black spotting, while other bowls had floral patterns outlined by grey or black-blue designs. Additionally, a few Ming red-and-white sherds were found, as well as white porcelain fragments with bluish highlights. The Adal sites appeared to reach an Indian Ocean terminus at the Sa'ad ad-Din Islands, named for Sultan Sa'ad ad-Din II of the Ifat Sultanate.|$|E
500|$|The {{engineers}} {{working on}} the sound-on-disc system were able to draw on expertise that Western Electric already had in electrical disc recording and were thus able to make faster initial progress. The main change required was to increase the playing time of the disc {{so that it could}} match that of a standard [...] reel of 35mm film. The chosen design used a disc nearly 16 inches (about 40cm) in diameter rotating at 331/3 rpm. This could play for 11 minutes, the running time of 1000ft of film at 90ft/min (24 frames/s). [...] Because of the larger diameter the minimum groove velocity of 70ft/min (14 <b>inches</b> <b>or</b> 356mm/s) was only slightly less than that of a standard 10-inch 78 rpm commercial disc.|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time, Fisher resorted to subterfuge to obtain another three fast, lightly {{armoured}} ships that could use several spare [...] gun turrets {{left over from}} battleship construction. These ships were essentially light battlecruisers, and Fisher occasionally referred to them as such, but officially they were classified as large light cruisers.

500|$|For {{the most}} part, the {{differences}} between one balkline game to another is defined by two measures: 1) the spacing of the balklines, and 2) the number of points that are allowed in each balk space before at least one ball must leave the region. Generally, balkline games, and their particular restrictions, are given numerical names indicating both of these characteristics; the first number indicated either <b>inches</b> <b>or</b> centimeters depending on the game, and the second, after a dot or a slash, indicates the count restriction in balk spaces, which is always either one or two. For example, in 18.2 balkline, {{one of the more}} prominent balkline games and of U.S. origin, the name indicates that balklines are drawn 18 inches distant from each rail, and only two counts are allowed (before the first short, we call [...] "entrée" [...] and for the second short [...] "dedans") in a balk space before a ball must leave (in 18.1, we call directly the first short [...] "dedans"). By contrast, in 71.2 balkline, of French invention, lines are drawn 71 centimeters distant from each rail, also with a two count restriction for balk spaces.|$|E
500|$|Austin in turn penned [...] "Creep" [...] {{and thought}} she would be its perfect lead.

Latoya Peterson of Spin observed that feminism was being loudly maligned in music {{at the time of the}} song's release, as a result, more female artists like TLC, Salt-N-Pepa and Tori Amos began to [...] "overtly defend themselves."
