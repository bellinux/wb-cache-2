40|$|Insurance {{is a key}} risk-sharing {{mechanism}} that protects citizens and governments from the losses caused by natural catastrophes. Given {{the increase in the}} frequency and intensity of natural catastrophes over recent years, this article analyzes the performance effects of mega-catastrophes for U. <b>S.</b> <b>insurance</b> firms using a measure of market expectations. Specifically, we analyze the share price losses of insurance firms in response to catastrophe events to ascertain whether mega-catastrophes significantly damage the performance of insurers and whether different types of mega-catastrophes have different impacts. The main message from our analysis is that the impact of mega-catastrophes on insurers has not been too damaging. While the exact impact of catastrophes depends {{on the nature of the}} event and the degree of competition within the relevant insurance market (less competition allows insurers to recoup catastrophe losses through adjustments to premiums), our overall results suggest that U. <b>S.</b> <b>insurance</b> firms can adequately manage the risks and costs of mega-catastrophes. From a public policy perspective, our results show that insurance provides a robust means of sharing catastrophe losses to help reduce the financial consequences of a catastrophe event...|$|R

Because drought is the primary cause of yield loss in the U. <b>S.</b> crop <b>insurance</b> program and because U. <b>S.</b> crop <b>insurance</b> rates assume that percentage yield losses are constant over time, these results indicate that U. <b>S.</b> crop <b>insurance</b> rates in the Corn Belt are too high...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates {{economies of}} scope in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>insurance</b> {{industry}} over the period 1993 - 1997. We test two primary hypotheses – the conglomeration hypothesis, which holds that operating a diversity of business can add value by exploiting cost and revenue scope economies, versus the strategic focus hypothesis, which holds that firms can best add value by focusing on core businesses and core competencies. We analyze whether it is advantageous for firms to offer both life-health and property-liability insurance or to specialize {{in one of the}} major industry segments. We test for {{economies of scope}} by estimating technical, cost, and revenue efficiency utilizing data envelopment analysis (DEA). An innovative feature of the analysis is the estimation of cross-frontier efficiency, where each group of firms (diversified firms and specialists) is compared to a reference set consisting of the other type of firm, enabling us to determine whether the specialization or conglomeration is the dominant strategy for each firm in the sample. The results provide only weak evidence for the existence of economies of scope in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>insurance</b> industry. Although diversified firms dominate specialists in the production of diversified firm output vectors in terms of revenue efficiency for both life-health and property-liability insurance, specialist firms dominat...|$|R

40|$|The {{state-based}} {{model of}} U. <b>S.</b> <b>insurance</b> regulation has been remarkably enduring to date, {{in part because}} the traditional rationales for a greater federal role – efficiency, uniformity, and consumer protection – have not succeeded in displacing it. However, the 2008 financial crisis, the federal government’s unprecedented bailouts of parts of the insurance sector, and the need for a coordinated international approach radically shifted the debate about the proper allocation of power between {{the federal government and the}} states by supplanting traditional concerns about efficiency, uniformity, and consumer protection in insurance with a new federal mission to control systemic risk. Unprepared and ill-equipped to counter this shift, the states face the biggest threat to their domination of U. <b>S.</b> <b>insurance</b> regulation in years. Already, the federal government has made inroads into insurance regulation for purposes of systemic risk oversight. That federal presence creates several openings for a broader federal role in insurance than just regulation of systemically important insurers. For instance, solvency regulation, which traditionally has been reserved to the states, increasingly could be subsumed under the rubric of systemic risk. Over time, other types of federal incursions could include higher reporting requirements for insurers, regulation of discrete, systemically risky activities (regardless of an insurer’s size), oversight of captive reinsurers, and greater consolidated supervision of insurance groups...|$|R
