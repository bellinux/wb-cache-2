50|$|The {{choice of}} a {{mechanical}} release aid versus a <b>finger</b> <b>tab</b> must be accounted for in a compound bow's tuning and sighting, as well as {{choice of a}}rrow rest, as finger-released arrows will group in a different spot when using a mechanical release aid versus a <b>finger</b> <b>tab.</b> Likewise, the choice of arrow rest for a compound bow depends on whether a finger release archery tab or mechanical release aid is used. For a finger-released arrow, a plunger pin is most commonly used as the arrow rest, to impart a tuned impulse laterally to the arrow {{at the moment of}} release to improve point-of-impact groupings. In contrast, for a release aid configuration, a Whisker-biscuit arrow rest is very commonly used with a compound bow.|$|E
50|$|A <b>finger</b> <b>tab</b> or Archer Tab used in archery {{is a small}} leather or {{synthetic}} patch {{that protects}} an archer's fingers from the bowstring. It is strapped or otherwise attached to an archer's hand. In summertime, tabs are far more comfortable than gloves and can more conveniently use thicker material. They are also less expensive and easier to fit, and are the normal finger-protection used with bows.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanical}} release retains the string by a gate or loop of cord. The gate or cord is released by {{operation of the}} trigger, allowing the string to push open the gate or cord. Consequently, any sideways movement of the string, and hence arrow nock, {{is likely to be}} less than if fingers were used, although, if a consistent <b>finger</b> <b>tab</b> release is performed, the differences are often negligible in terms of practical hunting accuracy at ranges up to 30 yards.|$|E
50|$|Protective {{equipment}} is normally {{used to protect}} {{the skin of the}} digits used. For the Mediterranean draw, the fingers may be protected with shooting gloves or by <b>finger</b> <b>tabs.</b> A shooting glove is a three-fingered glove that goes on the primary hand of the shooter. Models range from full-finger leather to gloves that only cover the tips of the fingers. These gloves are used mostly by traditional and bare-bow shooters. <b>Finger</b> <b>tabs</b> are pieces of material that are attached via leather straps or holes to the middle finger. For amateurs a plain tab made of leather is a simple, cheap, and still highly effective protection for the fingers.|$|R
5000|$|Archers using {{compound}} bows {{most commonly}} use a release aid {{to hold the}} string and release it precisely, although <b>finger</b> <b>tabs</b> are also popular with compound bows, especially among older archers who have used <b>finger</b> <b>tabs</b> when shooting recurve bows. The release aid attaches to the bowstring just below the nocking point or at the D loop and permits the archer to release the string {{by the use of}} some form of trigger. When such a device was first invented (patent filed in USA, 1879) it was known as a [...] "clutch". The trigger may be an actual trigger lever which is depressed by a finger or thumb (positive), or held and then released (negative); there are numerous types. Hydraulic and mechanical time delay triggers have been used, as have [...] "back tension" [...] triggers which are operated by either a change in the position of the release or [...] "true back tension"; the release triggers when a pre-determined draw weight is reached.|$|R
5000|$|After being tanned, leather {{from the}} [...] "front" [...] is {{typically}} {{used in the}} fabrication of gloves, or blackened, {{to be used in}} the tops of shoes. The [...] "butt", after tanning, is passed through a splitting-machine which removes the grain, or hair side, revealing what is termed the [...] "shell". The close fibers of the shell result in a smooth and pliable leather used almost exclusively in the manufacture of shoes [...] and watch straps, although another use is for the manufacture of <b>finger</b> protection <b>tabs</b> for recreational archery, where it is prized for its toughness, longevity, and protective qualities.|$|R
50|$|A {{mechanical}} release permits {{a single point}} of contact on the string instead of three fingers as most commonly used with finger tabs. This allows less deformity in the string at full draw, as well as providing a more consistent release. This is primarily because the most successful types operate with positive pressure, whereas the conventional 'fingers' release is negative pressure. Some archers prefer three fingers under the arrow with a <b>finger</b> <b>tab,</b> whereas the split-finger approach, having one finger above the arrow and two fingers below the arrow is the most commonly used finger shooting method amongst English and modern North American archers, who do not use {{mechanical release}} aids.|$|E

40|$|At {{least eight}} types of {{ubiquitin}} chain exist, and individual linkages affect distinct cellular processes. The only distinguishing feature of differently linked ubiquitin chains is their structure, as polymers {{of the same}} unit are chemically identical. Here, we have crystallized Lys 63 -linked and linear ubiquitin dimers, revealing that both adopt equivalent open conformations, forming no contacts between ubiquitin molecules and thereby differing significantly from Lys 48 -linked ubiquitin chains. We also examined the specificity of various deubiquitinases (DUBs) and ubiquitin-binding domains (UBDs). All analysed DUBs, except CYLD, cleave linear chains less efficiently compared with other chain types, or not at all. Likewise, UBDs can show chain specificity, {{and are able to}} select distinct linkages from a ubiquitin chain mixture. We found that the UBAN (ubiquitin binding in ABIN and NEMO) motif of NEMO (NF-kappaB essential modifier) binds to linear chains exclusively, whereas the NZF (Npl 4 zinc <b>finger)</b> domain of <b>TAB</b> 2 (TAK 1 binding protein 2) is Lys 63 specific. Our results highlight remarkable specificity determinants within the ubiquitin system...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper has}} {{introduced}} the {{finite element analysis}} (FEA) into the ergonomie design to evaluate the human feelings numerically and objectively, {{and then into the}} optimization design of beverage containers considering human factors. In the design of the end of can (the lid of can), experiments and the FEA of indenting vertically the fingertip pulp by a probe and the tab of end have been done to observe force responses and to study feelings in the fingertip. A numerical simulation of <b>finger</b> lifting the <b>tab</b> for opening the can has also been performed, and discomfort in the fingertip has been evaluated numerically to present the finger-accessibility of the tab. The comparison of finger-accessibility between two kinds of tab ring shape designs showed that the tab that may have a larger contact area with the finger is better. In the design of beverage bottles served hot drinks, the FEA of tactile sensation of heat has been performed to evaluate numerically the touch feeling of the finger when holding the hot bottle. The numerical simulations of embossing process have also been performed to evaluate the formability of various rib-shape designs. The optimum design has then been done considering the hot touch feeling as well as the metal sheet formability. Copyright © 2007 by ASME...|$|R
40|$|A novel DNA {{sequence}} element {{termed the}} J element {{involved in the}} regulated expression of class II major histocompatibility complex genes was recently described. To study this element {{and its role in}} class II gene regulation further, a cDNA library was screened with oligonucleotide probes containing both the S element and the nearby J element of the human DPA gene. Several DNA clones were obtained by this procedure, one of which, clone 18, is reported and characterized here. It encodes a protein predicted to contain 688 amino acid residues, including 11 zinc finger motifs of the C 2 H 2 type in the C-terminal region, that are Krüppel-like in the conservation of the H/C link sequence connecting them. The 160 N-terminal amino acids in the nonfinger region of clone 18 are highly homologous with similar regions of several other human, mouse, and Drosophila sequences, defining a subfamily of Krüppel-like zinc <b>finger</b> proteins termed <b>TAB</b> (tramtrack [ttk]-associated box) here. One of the Drosophila sequences, ttk, is a developmental control gene, while a second does not contain a zinc finger region but encodes a structure important in oocyte development. An acidic activation domain is located between the N-terminal conserved region of clone 18 and its zinc fingers. This protein appears to require both the S and J elements, which are separated by 10 bp for optimal binding. Antisense cDNA to clone 18 inhibited the expression of a reporter construct containing the DPA promoter, indicating its functional importance in the expression of this class II gene...|$|R
