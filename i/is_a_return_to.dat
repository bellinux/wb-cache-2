5|$|Battle for Zendikar was {{a return}} to the plane of Zendikar, which had been ravaged by the Eldrazi horrors. This marks a change in Magics storytelling, where each block's story is shown from the {{perspective}} of a group of planeswalkers called the Gatewatch. Shadows Over Innistrad <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> Innistrad, where Avacyn has been corrupted. The next set, Eldritch Moon, focuses on the fact that Emrakul, the most powerful Eldrazi titan who had been missing from the Battle for Zendikar storyline, is now on Innistrad. Together, the Gatewatch must find a way to save the plane from Emrakul's influence. This story also focuses on cosmic horror instead of the traditional gothic horror of old Innistrad.|$|E
5|$|Critics who {{admire his}} middle work might {{characterize}} it as supple and muscular in its rhythms and sometimes harshly modernist, while others find these poems barren and weak in imaginative power. Yeats's later work found new imaginative inspiration in the mystical system {{he began to}} work out for himself {{under the influence of}} spiritualism. In many ways, this poetry <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the vision of his earlier work. The opposition between the worldly minded man of the sword and the spiritually minded man of God, the theme of The Wanderings of Oisin, is reproduced in A Dialogue Between Self and Soul.|$|E

25|$|Like other Lutheran church bodies, the ELCA confesses {{at least}} two Sacraments: Communion (or the Eucharist) and Holy Baptism (including infant baptism).

25|$|On November 10, 2009, {{the band}} {{released}} their eleventh studio album, entitled The Circle. The Circle <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> rock n' roll after their Nashville influenced album, Lost Highway. The album debuted at {{number one in}} the U.S., Canada, Germany and Japan. Bon Jovi headed out on the road once again on February 19, 2010, embarking on The Circle Tour. Bon Jovi kicked off the stadium leg of the Circle Tour by making history. They played the first ever show at the brand new New Meadowlands Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The three sold out shows on May 26, 27 and 29, 2010 were a huge success. Bon Jovi's 12 night run at London's O2 Arena grossed $18,178,036 and seen them play to 187,696 fans. The Circle Tour was the highest-grossing concert tour of 2010 according to Billboard's annual Top 25 concert tours. So far the tour has played to 1,909,234 fans and has grossed $201.1 million from more than 80 venues reported to Pollstar. For the second time in three years, Bon Jovi ranked as Billboard's & Pollstar's Top Touring Act of the Year. Bon Jovi was also ranked second on Forbes magazine's list of the world's highest paid musicians, earning an approximate $125 million income that year.|$|E

25|$|From then {{until the}} dawn of the French Revolution, English modes of {{decoration}} in bookplates, as in most other chattels, follow at some years' distance the ruling French taste. The main characteristics of the style which prevailed during the Queen Anne and early Georgian periods are: ornamental frames suggestive of carved oak, a frequent use of fish-scales, trellis or diapered patterns, for the decoration of plain surfaces; and, in the armorial display, a marked reduction in the importance of the mantling. The introduction of the scallop-shell as an almost constant element of ornamentation gives already a foretaste of the Rocaille-Coquille, the so-called Chippendale fashions of the next reign. During the middle third of the century this rococo style (of which the Convers plate gives a typical sample) affects the bookplate as universally as all other decorative objects. Its chief element is a fanciful arrangement of scroll and shell work with curveting acanthus-like sprays—an arrangement which in the examples of the best period is generally made asymmetrical in order to give freer scope for a variety of countercurves. Straight or concentric lines and all appearances of flat surface are studiously avoided; the helmet and its symmetrical mantling tends to disappear, and is replaced by the plain crest on a fillet. The earlier examples of this manner are tolerably ponderous and simple. Later, however, the composition becomes exceedingly light and complicated; every conceivable and often incongruous element of decoration is introduced, from cupids to dragons, from flowerets to Chinese pagodas. During the early part of George III.'s reign there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> greater sobriety of ornamentation, and a style more truly national, which may be called the urn style, makes its appearance. Bookplates of this period have invariably a physiognomy which at once recalls the decorative manner made popular by architects and designers such as Chambers, the Adams, Josiah Wedgwood, Hepplewhite and Sheraton. The shield shows a plain spade-like outline, manifestly based upon that of the pseudo-classic urn then very alive. The ornamental accessories are symmetrical palms and sprays, wreaths and ribands. The architectural boss is also an important factor. In many plates, indeed, the shield of arms takes quite a subsidiary position {{by the side of the}} predominantly architectural urn.|$|E

500|$|Too Tough to Die was {{generally}} well received by critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called it [...] "the last great record [...] would ever make" [...] {{and noted that}} the use of Tommy Ramone as the album's producer was beneficial since it aided in the group returning [...] "to simple, scathing punk rock." [...] He also stated that the album reads [...] "like a reaction to hardcore punk", while still maintaining their more melodic style in songs. Music critic Robert Christgau also suggested that the album's sound was a retreat to their earlier styles [...] "with the cleansing minimalism of their original conception evoked", saying their initial sound is [...] "augmented rather than recycled." [...] Kurt Loder of the Rolling Stone concluded his review by saying that [...] "Too Tough to Die <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> fighting trim by the kings of stripped-down rock & roll." ...|$|E

500|$|Loud is a {{departure}} from the personal, melodramatic themes of Rated R. Stylistically, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the Caribbean-inspired dance-pop of Rihanna's earlier work. Ryan Burleson of Consequence of Sound described the album as [...] "a dynamic R and dance-pop record". In an interview with MTV, Rihanna said [...] "I wanted songs that were all Rihanna songs, that nobody else could do. I didn't want the generic pop record that Ke$ha or Lady Gaga or Katy Perry could just do and it'll work. I wanted a song, or songs, that were Rihanna songs, that only I could do, had that little West Indian vibe to it, had that certain tone, a certain sass and a certain energy." [...] During the promotion of Loud, Rihanna said that much of the music was born out of frustration. She explained: [...] "When you go to a club and have to listen to bad music you revert to the liquor, because {{you want to have a}} good time. I hate having to skip a track. I wanted to make an album you can just play." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon release, [...] "Perfect Illusion" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics. Alice Vincent of The Daily Telegraph gave the song {{four out of}} five stars, saying that it [...] "delights me to write that this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> 'Just Dance'-era Gaga: a simple, infectiously catchy slice of floor-filling, stadium-cheering pop". She also complimented the [...] "rich timbre" [...] of Gaga's vocals on the song, and her emoting. For Jess Denham from The Independent, [...] "Perfect Illusion" [...] sounded more rock-oriented than [...] "Just Dance" [...] or [...] "Poker Face"; she also complimented the vocals, compared the verses to work by singer Bruce Springsteen, and added that the track was [...] "as catchy as they come and sure to prove a club banger". Idolator's Robbie Daw described Gaga as a [...] "rock goddess". The [...] "dark and grungy" [...] sound of the track was relegated more towards Born This Way, rather than the songs from Artpop. Daw ended the review saying that it was a departure from Gaga's dance-pop work of her early career.|$|E
500|$|Mortal Kombat has {{received}} critical acclaim. GameZone's David Sanchez considered describing Mortal Kombat as [...] "a fitting reboot for the series" [...] {{to be an}} understatement, as [...] "while offering plenty of nostalgia" [...] the game is also [...] "a major step up for the series". Andrew Reiner of Game Informer called it [...] "the best Mortal Kombat yet." [...] According to Mark Waltron of GameSpot, [...] "over-the-top, bloody, and bursting with content, Mortal Kombat <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> form for the franchise." [...] IGN's Ryan Clements called it an [...] "amazing" [...] game that [...] "combines the novelty of extreme violence with a great fighting engine." [...] Neidel Crisan of 1UP.com stated it [...] "has simply {{set the standard for}} future fighting games to follow." [...] Eurogamer's Matt Edwards was more critical of the game, but added that [...] "to judge Mortal Kombat harshly simply because it isn’t the equal of BlazBlue or Street Fighter IV on a technical level would be unfair to what the game does right." [...] Brett Elston of GamesRadar was also more cautious in his review, stating it is [...] "a successful sequel that both reboots and redeems the wayward series, though it’s not a flawless victory." ...|$|E
