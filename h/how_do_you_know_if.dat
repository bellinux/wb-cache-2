40|$|The {{purpose of}} this chapter is to provide an {{overview}} of the development and use of clinical guidelines as a tool for decision making in clinical practice. Nurses have always developed and used tools to guide clinical decision making related to interventions in practice. Since Florence Nightingale (Nightingale 1860) gave us ‘notes’ on nursing in the late 1800 s, nurses have continued to use tools, such as standards, policies and procedures, protocols, algorithms, clinical pathways and clinical guidelines, to assist them in making appropriate decisions about patient care that eventuate in the best desired patient outcomes. Clinical guidelines have enjoyed growing popularity as a comprehensive tool for synthesising clinical evidence and information into user-friendly recommendations for practice. Historically, clinical guidelines were developed by individual experts or groups of experts by consensus, with no transparent process for the user to determine the validity and reliability of the recommendations. The acceptance of the evidence-based practice (EBP) movement as a paradigm for clinical decision making underscores the imperative for clinical guidelines to be systematically developed and based on the best available research evidence. Clinicians are faced with the dilemma of choosing from an abundance of guidelines of variable quality, or developing new guidelines. Where do you start? How do you find an existing guideline to fit your practice? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> a guideline is evidence-based, valid and reliable? Should you apply an existing guideline in your practice or develop a new guideline? How do you get clinicians to use the guidelines? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> using the guideline will make any difference in care delivery or patient outcomes? Whatever the choice, the challenge lies in choosing or developing a clinical guideline that is credible as a decision-making tool for the delivery of quality, efficient and effective care. This chapter will address the posed questions through an exploration of {{the ins and outs of}} clinical guidelines, from development to application to evaluation. ...|$|E

30|$|As one {{strategic}} planner put it, {{they are}} “swamped all the time” in requests. Another planner responsible for road maintenance asked, “Whom should we listen to? The loud ones? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> their opinions {{are representative of}} the quiet ones?” To the question of how planners handle such situations in practice, they answered that they relied on their local contacts with users, local authorities, and civil servants. In the interviews, no planner claimed that they needed more information on users at a general level. Instead they wanted better information and systematics for what the strategic planner above referred to as “N’s needs”—concrete, “customer-relevant” needs. Special interest organizations, municipalities, and county boards were used as users’ spokespersons in order to organize requests, but when a new road reaches the planning stage, with its legal requirement for user consultation, responsible planners are of the opinion that they lack the methods to ensure representativity.|$|E
40|$|When {{people get}} stressed, they seek relief in many ways. Some exercise, some {{practice}} specific breathing techniques, and some eat chocolate. Farm animals become stressed, too. In domesticated food animals, stress can affect meat quality, milk production, and general health. But animal stress must often be intuited from clues such as lower-than-anticipated weights and increased illness. Certain stressful events can be anticipated, for example, birth and weaning. But <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> an animal is stressed {{for some other}} reason? Ted H. Elsasser of ARS’ Growth Biology Laboratory in Beltsville, Maryland, is investigating nitrated protein as a biomarker of stress. Nitrated proteins may serve as an early-warning system to point out an animal that may yield unsafe products or flag a need for therapeutic or intervention strategies to promote recovery from illness. “The biggest problem for animal producers is disease management, so an early warning system would certainly be helpful,” says Elsasser...|$|E
