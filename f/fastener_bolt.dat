40|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} limiting the life of critical aircraft engine components, such as compressor discs and spacers, is the formation of low cycle fatigue (LCF) cracks in the <b>fastener</b> <b>bolt</b> holes. Such cracks are often initiated from corners and their surfaces are oxidized during the engine operation. Eddy current techniques using rotating probes {{are considered to be}} the most appropriate for detecting bolt hole cracks. Inspection according to damage tolerance criteria requires repeatable detection (90 % probability of detection with 95 % confidence) of cracks of the order of 0. 125 mm (0. 005 ″). If only threshold setting methods are used by a human analyst or implemented by means of electronic instrumentation, detectability can be low since it is difficult to distinguish between the actual flaw signal and noise in the eddy current signal as both are of similar amplitude. However, in certain cases, searching for structure in the noisy waveform can provide indications of defects that escape detection by threshold setting techniques. One way of achieving this is by using multi-parameter signal analysis and pattern recognition methods...|$|E
40|$|A {{new family}} of {{innovative}} martensitic stainless steels, 521 -A, 521 -B, and 521 -C {{has been developed}} by Advanced Steel Technology, LLC (Trafford, PA) as high strength <b>fastener</b> (<b>bolt)</b> materials for use at moderate temperatures in turbine engines, including steam turbines, gas turbines, and aircraft engines. The primary objective of the development program {{was to create a}} martensitic stainless steel with high strength at moderate temperatures, and which could replace the expensive nickel-based superalloy IN 718 in some fasteners applications. A secondary objective was to replace conventional 12 Cr steels such as AISI 422 used as blades, buckets and shafts that operate at intermediate temperatures in turbine engines with stronger steel. The composition of the new alloys was specifically designed to produce excellent mechanical properties while integrating heat treatment steps into production to reduce energy consumption during manufacturing. As a result, production costs and energy consumption during production of rolled bar products is significantly lower than conventional materials. Successful commercialization of the new alloys would permit the installed cost of certain turbine engines to be reduced without sacrificing high availability or operational flexibility, thereby enhancing the global competitiveness of U. S. turbine engine manufacturers. Moreover, the domestic specialty steel industry would also benefit through increased productivity and reduced operating costs, while increasing their share of the international market for turbine engine fasteners, blades, buckets and shafts...|$|E

30|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} moisture content (MC) of members on the mechanical properties of timber joints, bending tests of precut joints and shear tests of dowel-type joints were carried out using timbers of Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica D. Don) with three moisture conditions: green, kiln-dried with a MC target of 15 %, and over-kiln-dried with a MC target of 5 %. For the bending test, timbers were processed with a precut processing machine into “koshikake-ari” (a kind of dovetail joint) and “koshikake-kama” (a kind of mortise and tenon joint). A pair of members was jointed together without mechanical <b>fasteners.</b> <b>Bolts</b> (diameter = 12 [*]mm) and nails (diameter = 2.45 [*]mm) were used as dowels in the shear test. Bolted joints were constructed with one bolt and two metal side plates. Two nails and two metal side plates {{were used for the}} nailed joint. For precut joints, no clear effect of MC was recognized on maximum moment and initial stiffness. The maximum strength of mechanical joints assembled with kiln-dried wood was changed by the degree of drying. Stiffness of the joints assembled with kiln-dried specimens was larger than that of the joints assembled with green specimens.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{compares the}} test methods {{according}} to the ABNT NBR 7190 : 1997, EN 383 : 2007, ASTM D 5764 : 2007, EUROCODE 5 : 2004, NDS: 2001 standards {{in order to provide}} support to establish a new test method for determining the embedment strength of wood parallel to the grain. Parallel-to-grain tests were carried out for six wood species (Schizolobium amazonicum; Pinus elliottii; Pinus oocarpa; Hymenaea spp.; Lyptus(r) : hybrid Eucalyptus grandis and Eucalyptus urophylla, and Goupia glabra) using four diameters (8 mm, 10 mm, 12 mm and 16 mm) for the metal pin <b>fasteners</b> (<b>bolts).</b> The experimental results obtained {{according to the}} EN 383 : 2007 standard were closer to the specific values for the metal-dowel connections design used by ABNT NBR 7190 : 1997, which are considered equal compression parallel to the grain.

50|$|This is {{the point}} where the neck meets the body. In the {{traditional}} Spanish neck joint the neck and block are one piece with the sides inserted into slots cut in the block. Other necks are built separately and joined to the body either with a dovetail joint, mortise or flush joint. These joints are usually glued and can be reinforced with mechanical fasteners. Recently many manufacturers use <b>bolt</b> on <b>fasteners.</b> <b>Bolt</b> on neck joints were once associated only with less expensive instruments but now some top manufacturers and hand builders are using variations of this method. Some people believed that the Spanish style one piece neck/block and glued dovetail necks have better sustain, but testing has failed to confirm this.While most traditional Spanish style builders use the one piece neck/heel block, Fleta, a prominent Spanish builder, used a dovetail joint due to the influence of his early training in violin making.One reason for the introduction of the mechanical joints was {{to make it easier to}} repair necks. This is more of a problem with steel string guitars than with nylon strings, which have about half the string tension. This is why nylon string guitars often don't include a truss rod either.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, fatigue {{strength}} of the engine damper cap screw bolt is determined. Engine damper cap screw is critical fastener. Critical fastener is a term used to describe a cap screw that, upon failure, causes immediate engine shutdown or possible harm to person. So, determination of {{fatigue strength}} is important. S-N method is used for cap screw fatigue strength determination by testing number of samples at different alternating load keeping mean load constant. Alternating load is increased until cap screws begin to fail. But for measurement of axial load in <b>fasteners,</b> ultrasonic <b>bolt</b> gauging method is used.

50|$|The {{stress and}} shear in a rivet is {{analyzed}} like a bolted joint. However, {{it is not}} wise to combine rivets with bolts and screws in the same joint. Rivets fill the hole where they are installed to establish a very tight fit (often called interference fit). It is difficult or impossible to obtain such a tight fit with other fasteners. The result is that rivets in the same joint with loose fasteners carry more of the load—they are effectively more stiff. The rivet can then fail before it can redistribute load to the other loose fit <b>fasteners</b> like <b>bolts</b> and screws. This often causes catastrophic failure of the joint when the fasteners unzip. In general, a joint composed of similar fasteners is the most efficient because all fasteners reach capacity simultaneously.|$|R

50|$|Typical {{drilling}} and milling operations, {{as well as}} manufacturing practices for bolt threads, introduce mechanical play proportional {{to the size of}} the <b>fasteners.</b> For example, <b>bolts</b> up to 10 mm in diameter typically have play on the order of 0.2 mm. When dowels are used in addition to bolts, however, the tighter dimensional tolerances of dowels and their mating holes—typically 0.01 mm—result in significantly less play, on the order of 0.02 mm. Manufacturing costs are inversely proportional to mechanical tolerances and, as a result, engineers must balance the need for mechanical precision against cost as well as other factors such as manufacturability and serviceability.|$|R

Making components within systems separable also assists {{in being able to}} dismantle materials quickly and efficiently. This can be achieved by using mechanical <b>fasteners</b> such as <b>bolts</b> to connect parts. Allowing physical access to the fasteners is another needed aspect of this design.

40|$|For {{satellite}} applications {{the determination}} of the correct dynamic behaviour and in particular the structural damping is important to assess the vibration environment for the spacecraft subsystems and ultimately their capability to withstand the launch vibration environment. Therefore, the object of this investigation is to experimentally analyse a range of aluminium panel configurations to study the effect of joints on the damping of the complete structure. The paper begins with a full description of the experimental method used to accurately determine the modal loss factors for each of the panel configurations analysed. Nine different panels were used in the experimental tests, six of which incorporate lap joints variations. The joint parameters investigated include <b>fastener</b> type, <b>bolt</b> torque, <b>fastener</b> spacing, overlap distance and the effect of stiffeners. The damping results of ten different joint variants are presented for each of the first twelve modes of vibration. This data is directly compared to the damping factors of an equivalent monolithic panel. Various specific conclusions are made with respect to each of the joint parameters investigated. However, the primary conclusion is that the mode shape combined with the joint stiffness and joint location can be suggestive as to the likely magnitude increase of the modal loss factor. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
