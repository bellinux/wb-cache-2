The Secretary of Energy, Shirley Abbott (Dianne Wiest), is actively warning various politicians and the president that the power grid is too outdated to handle real natural disasters and that it is too vulnerable to attack. Dan London (Ari Cohen), the chief engineer of Lexer, has also repeatedly warned Lexer that their systems are too vulnerable to hackers, but the company is only interested in <b>going</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> cheapest options. He decides to blow the whistle on the company to Harkin, but as he refuses to appear on camera, Harkin's boss will not allow the piece to air.|$|E

25|$|As {{the game}} was under development, various ideas were {{rejected}} as the team settled on an approach. For example, initially, the developers planned to have an Active Time Battle combat system, before <b>going</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Conditional Time Battle system. Another rejected idea was an auto-equip for weapons and armor, which would automatically equip the strongest piece of equipment. In tandem with this was an auto-allocation of experience points, whereby the game would choose to distribute points among the various attributes. Another rejected idea was that in Evil Mode, the good characters against whom the player would be fighting would replicate the actions taken by the player when they had played through the main game; the player's actions during the main game would be replicated by the AI controlled party. Eventually, however, this idea was scrapped and Evil Mode was simplified.|$|E

25|$|It was April 1909 when Byng was {{promoted}} to major-general and, though he was placed on half pay, Byng—with added income from editing the Cavalry Journal and serving as the first north Essex District Commissioner for the Boy Scouts—purchased his first house, Newton Hall, in Dunmow, Essex. He would, however, only reside there for two years, as, exactly {{the same amount of}} time after taking command of the East Anglian Infantry Division of the Territorial Force in October 1910, Byng became General Officer Commanding the British Troops in Egypt, where he remained until the outbreak of the First World War. He then returned briefly to the United Kingdom to take leadership of the 3rd Cavalry Division before <b>going</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> British Expeditionary Force to France and the First Battle of Ypres. His actions there were rewarded in March 1915 with appointment as a Knight Commander of the Order of St. Michael and St. George.|$|E
25|$|Starting at age 21, Fassbinder {{made over}} forty films and TV dramas in fifteen years, along with {{directing}} numerous {{plays for the}} theatre. These films were largely written or adapted for the screen by Fassbinder. He was also art director {{on most of the}} early films, editor or co-editor on many of them (often credited as Franz Walsh, though the spelling varies), and he acted in nineteen of his own films as well as for other directors. He wrote fourteen plays, created new versions of six classical plays, and directed or co-directed twenty-five stage plays. He wrote and directed four radio plays and wrote song lyrics. In addition, he wrote thirty-three screenplays and collaborated with other screenwriters on thirteen more. On top of this, he occasionally performed many other roles such as cinematographer and producer on a small number of them. Working with a regular ensemble of actors and technicians, he was able to complete films ahead of schedule and often under budget and thus compete successfully for government subsidies. He worked fast, typically omitting rehearsals and <b>going</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> first take.|$|E

500|$|Director of {{photography}} Ben Davis used Arri Alexa XT cameras for the film, saying, [...] "I’m traditionally a photochemical fan, but <b>going</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> digital format {{was the right}} way for this movie... the Alexa [...] the right look for this particular film." [...] During the opening scenes in the 1980s, Davis chose JDC Cooke Xtal (Crystal) Express anamorphic prime lenses because they [...] "had more anamorphic artifacts and aberrations, which [...] felt added something." [...] Davis used spherical Panavision Primos {{for the rest of}} the film. Additionally, Davis worked closely with production designer Charles Wood in order to achieve the correct lighting looks for each scene. Dealing with two fully CGI characters forced Davis to shoot scenes multiple times, usually once with the references for the characters and once without them in the shot.|$|E
500|$|Goldsmith is well {{regarded}} by science fiction historians for her innovation, {{and the impact}} she had on the early careers of writers such as Ursula K. Le Guin and Roger Zelazny, but circulation lagged during her tenure. By 1964 Fantastics circulation was down to 27,000, with Amazing doing little better. The following March both Amazing and Fantastic were sold to Ultimate Publishing Company, run by Sol Cohen and Arthur Bernhard. Goldsmith was given the choice of <b>going</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> magazines or staying with Ziff-Davis; she stayed, and Cohen hired Joseph Wrzos to edit the magazines, starting with the August and September 1965 issues of Amazing and Fantastic, respectively. Wrzos used the name [...] "Joseph Ross" [...] on the mastheads to avoid mis-spellings. Both magazines immediately moved to a bi-monthly schedule.|$|E

500|$|Raimi {{showed the}} film to anyone willing to watch it, booking {{meetings}} with distribution agents and anyone with experience in the film industry. Eventually Raimi came across Irvin Shapiro, {{the man who was}} responsible for the distribution of George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead and other famous horror films. Upon first viewing the film, he joked that while it [...] "wasn't Gone with the Wind", it had commercial potential, and he expressed an interest in distributing it. It was his idea not to use the then-title Book of the Dead, because it made the film sound boring. Raimi brainstormed several ideas, eventually <b>going</b> <b>with</b> <b>The</b> Evil Dead, deemed the [...] "least worst" [...] title. Shapiro also advised distributing the film worldwide to garner a larger income, though it required a further financial investment by Raimi, who managed to scrape together what little money he had.|$|E
500|$|Other reviews {{disliked the}} lack of story or its {{presentation}} within Limbo. Justin Haywald of 1UP.com was critical of the lacking narrative, feeling that the game failed to explain {{the purpose of the}} constructed traps or rationale for how the game's world worked, and that the final act left him [...] "more confused than when [...] began". Haywald had contrasted Limbo to Braid, a similar platform game with minimalistic elements which communicates its metaphorical story to the player through in-game text. Roger Hargreaves of Metro stated that the game has [...] "very little evidence that [...] really knew where they were <b>going</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> game", citing the second half, when the player is traveling through a factory-type setting and where he felt the game became more like a typical two-dimensional platform game, and led to an anticlimactic ending; Hargreaves contrasted this to more gruesome elements of the first half, such as encountering corpses of children and having to use those as part of the puzzle-solving aspects.|$|E
500|$|Downey {{acknowledged}} the potential controversy over his role: [...] "At {{the end of}} the day, it's always about how well you commit to the character. If I didn't feel it was morally sound, or that it would be easily misinterpreted that I'm just C. Thomas Howell , I would've stayed home." [...] Jackson stated: [...] "When I first read the script, I was like: What? Blackface? But when I saw him [...] he, like, became a black man ...It was just good acting. It was weird on the set because he would keep <b>going</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> character. He's a method actor." [...] Stiller commented on Downey's portrayal of a white actor playing a black man: [...] "When people see the movie— {{in the context of the}} film, he's playing a method actor who's gone to great lengths to play a black guy. The movie is skewering actors and how they take themselves so seriously." [...] Stiller previewed the film before the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and several black journalists reacted positively to the character.|$|E

500|$|... "Listen to the Rain on the Roof" [...] {{was written}} by series creator Marc Cherry and series writer Jeff Greenstein and {{directed}} by Larry Shaw. Cherry's decision to advance the storylines by six months for the third season premiere came {{as a response to}} the series' problematic second season. Cherry stated that he regretted most of the second season, as scheduling problems made it difficult to plan the season's storylines. [...] "One of the problems I had with Season 2 was that I had to keep <b>going</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> previous year's stuff," [...] he explained. [...] "I learned you have to go back to square one to build up the tension again." [...] The cast also expressed disappointment in the second season; James Denton considered leaving the show and Marcia Cross confessed: [...] "I've been at Marc's door plenty of times [...] going, 'You've got to be kidding.'" [...] Cherry stated that the six-month time jump would help the storylines develop quicker, as the second season's storylines lagged. He added: [...] "And I'm going to work much harder to criss-cross all the women's stories so that their lives bump up against each other." ...|$|E
500|$|Arthur's costume was {{the easiest}} to create, as the color scheme {{mirrored}} his comic book counterpart, and was constructed to give a [...] "wetsuit look". The costume was also designed to be more form-fitting, to complement Ritchson's physique. Victor and Arthur's tops were also hoodie variations. When designing Dinah Lance's Black Canary costume, {{certain aspects of the}} comic book character were kept, while others changed entirely. For instance, the character retains her classic fishnet stockings, but the external, black mask the character wears is swapped for a painted mask. Cranstoun researched the various versions of Black Canary's costume, looking through the 1940s and 50s, to {{try to come up with}} the right version for the show. Cranstoun explained that she primarily came across two versions. One version reminded the designer of a Playboy Bunny, with a [...] "curvy, corseted, strapless thing that was not at all action-friendly". The other was more reminiscent of Lara Croft and Tank Girl, which is the route Cranstoun took. What Cranstoun created was a [...] "zipped, sleeveless body suit with a boot that was really flat and practical". The designer also kept the yellow accents the comic version had, as well as the long gloves. The filming crew did test shots with various masks for the character, including a leather mask reminiscent of the comic book character's look, before <b>going</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> painted variation.|$|E
500|$|David Browne of Entertainment Weekly gave Zooropa an [...] "A", {{calling it}} [...] "harried, spontaneous-sounding, and {{ultimately}} exhilarating album". Browne {{noted that it}} sounds [...] "messy" [...] and [...] "disconnected", but clarified [...] "that sense of incoherence is the point" [...] {{in the context of}} the record's technology themes. He concluded, [...] "For an album that wasn't meant to be an album, it's quite an album." [...] Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times gave the record a maximum score of four stars. In two separate articles, he said that it [...] "captured the anxious, even paranoid tone of the Zoo TV Tour" [...] so much so that [...] "it stands as the first tour album that doesn't include any of the songs from the tour" [...] and yet sounds like a [...] "souvenir" [...] of Zoo TV. In a positive review, Jim Sullivan of The Boston Globe called the album a [...] "creative stretch", noting that the band experiments more yet retains their recognizable sound. He commented that the group's [...] "yearning anthemic reach" [...] and [...] "obvious, slinky pop charm" [...] are replaced with [...] "darker corners, more disruptive interjections, more moodiness". Paul Du Noyer of Q gave Zooropa a score of four-out-of-five stars, finding a [...] "freewheeling feel of <b>going</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> flow" [...] throughout the album and calling it [...] "rootless and loose, restless and unsettled". For Du Noyer, U2 sounded [...] "monstrously tight as a performing unit and fluidly inventive as composers, so the results transcend the merely experimental".|$|E
