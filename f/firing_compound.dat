40|$|The {{effects of}} two fire {{retardant}} materials, (NH 4) (2) SO 4 and (NH 4) (2) HPO 4, on cellulose pyrolysis studied using thermogravimetry-mass spectrometry (TG-MS) analysis. In {{order to determine}} quantitatively H 2 O and CO 2 during pure and fire retarded cellulose pyrolysis, the MS signal was calibrated using KHCO 3 decomposition. The MS signal calibration {{in relation to the}} flow stability through TG-MS interface was examined. The influence of the TG furnace temperature on MS signal, and the effects of heat and mass transfer phenomena were also discussed. Furthermore, the criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the <b>fire</b> retardant <b>compounds</b> on cellulose pyrolysis were examined. Both <b>fire</b> retardant <b>compounds</b> resulted in the increase of the non-combustible pyrolysis products, such as H 2 O and CO 2, and char. Low levels of levoglucosan were recorded. It appears that {{in the presence of the}} <b>fire</b> retardant <b>compounds</b> a relative increase of levoglucosenone in the evolved gases is observed. Finally, the effects of the fire retardants on the pyrolysis mechanism were discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|However, these {{impressive}} victories became overshadowed at Le Mans {{when the}} once again leading 300 SLRs were withdrawn after a horrific accident involving a team car driven by Pierre Levegh. Even with the innovative wind-brake, the car's drum brakes {{had been unable}} to prevent Levegh from rear-ending an Austin-Healey, causing his car to become airborne. Upon impact, the ultra-lightweight Elektron bodywork's high magnesium content caused it to ignite and burn in the ensuing fuel <b>fire.</b> <b>Compounding</b> it, an uninformed race fire crew initially tried to extinguish it with water, only making it burn hotter. Eighty-four spectators and Levegh lost their lives in what remains the highest-fatality accident in the history of motorsport.

40|$|Understory {{vegetation}} and ground cover drive many important ecosystem processes, including tree seedling regeneration. The exact effect of ground cover on tree seedling establishment, survival, and growth depends on biophysical context. In subalpine forests, this context is largely determined by disturbances such as beetle outbreak, blowdown, and <b>fire.</b> <b>Compounded</b> disturbances that overlap in short succession can alter stand properties and trajectories {{in ways that}} are not predictable from the additive impact of individual disturbances. The aim {{of this study is to}} examine how compounded Dendroctonus rufipennis (spruce beetle; SB) outbreak followed by <b>fire</b> and <b>compounded</b> wind blowdown followed by fire each influence the relationship between post-fire ground cover and conifer regeneration. We measured categorical ground cover percentages and conifer regeneration densities in permanent plots from 2003 - 2014 after stand-replacing fires of 2002 burned stands that had been blown down in 1997, affected by SB outbreak in the 1940 s, or neither. We used mixed-effect models to measure the relationships between stand attributes and post-fire ground cover as well as between post-fire ground cover and conifer regeneration densities. Ground cover patterns were sensitive to compounded disturbances, and the relationships between conifer regeneration and ground cover were fundamentally different when fire was preceded by another disturbance. Conifer regeneration densities increased with increased litter coverage in stands that only burned, but decreased with increased litter coverage in stands that were blown down and then burned. Similarly, herbaceous cover changed from facilitative to competitive when fire was preceded by SB outbreak. Forest regeneration following compound disturbances is at least partly modulated by disturbance-induced changes in ground cover...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of cooperative action of commercial fire retardants is interpreted as resulting from specific chemical reaction and phase changes. This investigation {{focuses on the}} thermally initiated interactions between two forms of commercially available <b>fire</b> retardant <b>compounds.</b> The <b>fire</b> performance of a polyolefin with a metal hydroxide fire retardant, magnesium hydroxide, can significantly reduce the heat release rate through absorption of heat during conversion to its metal oxide. Formation of water, followed by vaporisation, decreases heat and dilutes volatiles from polymer degradation. The second form of <b>fire</b> retardant <b>compounds</b> are zinc borates (2 ZnO· 3 B 2 O 3 · 3 H 2 O and 4 ZnO·B 2 O 3 ·H 2 O), that undergo dehydration with increasing temperature. Differential thermal analysis and wide-angle X-ray spectroscopy indicated that various structural changes occurred during heating. Endothermic transitions were observed for all components, while zinc borate (2 ZnO· 3 B 2 O 3 · 3 H 2 O) showed an exothermic crystallisation transition at relatively high temperature. The exotherm was modified {{by the development of}} a new crystalline phase, magnesium orthoborate (3 MgO·B 2 O 3) that formed on reaction with magnesium oxide (MgO) at temperatures greater than 500 °C.

30|$|Limited {{progress}} has been made in the flammability reduction of wood in recent years. Some of the fire retardant timber treatments are two millennia old, where alum was used by Romans. Since then, the synergism between phosphorus and nitrogen, and often boron too, has been widely studied in academia and exploited in various commercial products. Nowadays, many end-users and regulators recognise the hazards presented from the toxicity, smoke and corrosiveness of <b>fire</b> retardant <b>compounds,</b> due to the large volume of attention given to halogenated flame retardants. There is a current contentious toxicity problem with boron and as such, a need for wood products to move away from boron based fire retardants is recognised.

40|$|AbstractThe 3 rd {{generation}} {{fire truck}} takes use of compressed gas as spraying medium. By {{way of the}} especially designed spraying device in the 3 rd generation fire truck, the extinguishing agents mixed with compressed gas uniformly, are spraying to fire fields in microdots with high speed and high flux. The extinguishing agents’ microdots with high kinematic energy can penetrate into the flame and affront the flame with more interface areas. The extinguishing efficiency is improved significantly consequently. In a fire fighting by the 3 rd generation fire truck, fire can be extinguished more quickly, larger field of fire can be controlled, water damage and environmental pollution is decreased too. The 3 rd generation fire truck can also help positive pressure ventilating, cooling fire, blowing and diluting the toxic smoke, and rescuing persons from the fire. Up to the present, different kinds of the 3 rd generation fire trucks have been successfully developed such as turbojet fire truck, water mist fire truck, compressed air-foam A/B fire truck, aerosol <b>fire</b> truck, <b>compound</b> spraying <b>fire</b> truck and positive pressure ventilating truck etc. They are playing important roles in fighting fire in urban building, petrochemical enterprises, underground facilities, aircrafts and others...|$|R
