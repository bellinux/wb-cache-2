25|$|Soloveitchik's four step {{scholarly}} {{approach to}} learning has influenced many of his students. The approach {{can be traced back}} to the approach of the Gaon of Vilna. The first step is concentrating on the text. This follows the Vilna Gaon's approach of carefully amending the texts of both exoteric (the Talmud) and esoteric works (for instance, the Torat Kohanim, Tosefta, Avot de-Rabbi Natan, etc.). The second step <b>is</b> <b>knowing</b> the physical reality of the objects described. Third is the conceptual analysis proffered by Rishonim. At this point he introduces an important distinction between Rishonim, which are primary sources, and must be mastered, even if one has to struggle to understand them; and Achronim, which are secondary sources, which can be exploited (if you find good material, use it, but if you don't understand it, don't spend too much time on it). The fourth and final step is sevarah, creating the intellectual framework underpinning the Torah.|$|E

[...] Critic Hal Erickson of AllRovi wrote that the film [...] "is a perfect balance of song and story from beginning to end". Mark Deming, also a critic for AllRovi, wrote that Jailhouse Rock it was [...] "one of [...] few vehicles which really caught his raw, sexy energy and sneering charisma on film." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite his reluctance, Scheider {{pledged to}} do the best job that he could, wanting to make Brody believable. However, the {{atmosphere}} was tense on the set, and he often argued with Szwarc. On one occasion, Scheider complained (in front of extras) that Szwarc was wasting time with technical issues and the extras while ignoring the principal actors. A meeting was called with the two, David Brown and Verna Fields, in which Scheider and Szwarc were encouraged to settle their differences. The discussion became heated and a physical fight broke out, which Brown and Fields broke up. The rift was also articulated in written correspondence. In a letter to Szwarc, Scheider wrote that [...] "working with Jeannot Szwarc <b>is</b> <b>knowing</b> he will never say he is sorry or ever admitting he overlooked something. Well, enough of that shit for me!" [...] He requested an apology from the director for not consulting him. Szwarc's reply focused upon completing the film to the [...] "best possible" [...] standard: ...|$|E

2500|$|Quite {{possibly}} the most important consideration in sample preparation <b>is</b> <b>knowing</b> what phase the sample must be in for analysis to be successful.

2500|$|Buckland {{described}} his process to {{a newspaper reporter}} in 1920. [...] Buckland said he would review the script {{to get an idea}} of what the characters were like and what their surroundings should be. [...] He would prepare sketches of the required sets and turn the sketches over to a force of architectural draftsmen in the next room. [...] After a structure was built, Buckland would also direct the interior painting and decorations. [...] He noted at the time that he hoped to see film sets move away from the building of real or photographic interiors and deal more with atmosphere. [...] He added:"In painting a picture an artist does not paint a real house, reproducing every minute detail. That sort of thing belongs to the old and now despised photographic school of art. [...] He paints in something to give tone to the figures. The great secret of art, as Whistler said, <b>is</b> <b>knowing</b> what to leave out. Every once [...] you get a shock by discovering a picture in which the director has shown signs of an artistic conscience. But the majority of moving pictures are still far behind commercial photography, which is becoming less and less photographic while most of the advertisements in the back pages of our magazines are more artistic than the average movie." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{order for}} an army {{to be in}} good {{fighting}} condition, it must maintain the health of its soldiers. [...] One way of doing this <b>is</b> <b>knowing</b> the proper location to set up camp. [...] Military camps were not to be set up in any sort of marshy region. [...] Marsh lands tend to have standing water, which can draw in mosquitos. [...] Mosquitos in turn can carry deadly disease, such as malaria. [...] As the camp and troops were needed to be moved, the troops would be wearing heavy soled shoes in order to prevent wear on soldiers’ feet. [...] Waterborne illness has also remained an issue throughout the centuries. [...] When soldiers would look for water they would be searching for some sort of natural spring, or other form of flowing water. [...] When water sources were found, any type of rotting wood, or plant material, would be removed before the water was used for drinking. [...] If these features could not be removed, then water would be drawn from {{a different part of the}} source. [...] By doing this the soldiers were more likely to be drinking from a safe source of water. [...] Thus, water borne bacteria had a less chance of making soldiers ill. [...] One process used to check for dirty water, was to moisten a fine white linen cloth with the water and leave it out to dry. [...] If the cloth had any type of stain, it would be considered to be diseased. [...] If the cloth was clean, the water was healthy and drinkable. [...] Fresh water also assists with sewage disposal, as well as wound care. [...] Thus, a source of fresh water was a preemptive measure taken to defeat disease and keep men healthy once they were wounded.|$|E

The three levels are preconventional, conventional and postconventional. The four kinds of <b>knowing</b> <b>are</b> distinguishable {{with respect to the}} object or states of affairs in relation to which the <b>knowing</b> <b>is</b> performed.
