40|$|M. Comm. (Economics) The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the pattern of gross <b>domestic</b> <b>saving</b> in South Africa. This study looks at gross <b>domestic</b> <b>saving</b> in South Africa in general and the trends of its {{components}} in particular. It addresses the impacts of internal and external policies on the disaggregated <b>domestic</b> <b>saving</b> in South Africa. This is done with the aim of establishing the channels through which these policies influence the components of South Africa’s <b>domestic</b> <b>saving.</b> This study focuses on current economic literature while examining gross <b>domestic</b> <b>saving</b> and its attributes. A brief discussion of gross <b>domestic</b> <b>saving</b> on emerging market region puts sub-Saharan Africa’s gross <b>domestic</b> <b>saving,</b> particularly that of South Africa, into perspective. Hence, the developments in South Africa’s <b>domestic</b> <b>saving</b> are compared with those of some selected countries. An analysis of gross <b>domestic</b> <b>saving</b> in South Africa for the period 1970 to 2004 indicates a long-run downward pattern. The disaggregated <b>domestic</b> <b>saving</b> in South Africa shows that although three components contributed to the decline in South Africa’s <b>domestic</b> <b>saving,</b> the public sector appeared to be the main culprit in the decline. Thus, the net saving by the government had been negative since early 1980. The study observes that the patterns of saving of the three components are influenced by both internal and external factors. iv These internal and external factors are made up of fiscal and monetary policies, and the balance of payments. Without over-emphasising the importance of gross <b>domestic</b> <b>saving</b> in any economy, it is crucial for South Africa to encourage a positive saving culture for improvement in meaningful domestic investment for long-term economic growth. This study, therefore, suggests that in a developing economy like the South African economy, a positive saving attitude could be encouraged through the use of internal and external policies. Hence, the positive impact of internal and external factors could motivate all stakeholders in gross <b>domestic</b> <b>saving</b> to seize any available opportunity to boost their savings, thereby raising South Africa’s gross <b>domestic</b> <b>saving...</b>|$|R

25|$|However, as Australia's CAD {{is almost}} entirely {{generated}} by the private sector, as outlined in Professor John Pitchford's 'Consenting Adults Thesis' in the early 1990s, there is an argument that the CAD is not a significant issue.

This suggests that Australia's apparently low savings level and CAD are not necessarily a significant problem. As long as the investment that is being funded by overseas capital inflow generates sufficient returns to pay for the servicing costs in the future, the increase in foreign liabilities can be viewed as sustainable in the longer term.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} also carried out an import substitution policy, taking what {{was obtained by}} agriculture to give support to the industrial sector, trading agricultural product exports for foreign currency to import industrial machinery, thus developing the industrial sector. The government raised tariffs, controlled foreign exchange and restricted imports {{in order to protect}} domestic industry. By the 1960s, Taiwan's import exchange industry was faced with the problem of saturating the domestic market. At the same time, the factories of some industrialized nations, because of rising wages and other reasons, slowly moved to certain areas that had both basic industry and low labor costs. By slow steps, the economic policy of Taiwan changed to pursue export expansion under advice of academic economists such as Ta-Chung Liu and Sho-Chieh Tsiang of Cornell University. They also promoted allowing interest rates to rise, to encourage <b>domestic</b> <b>savings</b> and expand the amount of resources available to fund new businesses. Additional academic advisers also members of Academic Sinica provided sound advice encouraging innovation in agricultural techniques, enabling one of the few successful takeoffs toward modern growth based on agricultural investment in cash crops for export.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} data on trends {{over time in}} <b>domestic</b> <b>saving</b> rates in twelve economies in {{developing}} Asia during the 1966 - 2007 period and analyze the determinants of these trends. We find that <b>domestic</b> <b>saving</b> rates in developing Asia have, in general, been high and rising but {{that there have been}} substantial differences from economy to economy and that the main determinants of these trends appear to have been the age structure of the population (especially the aged dependency ratio), income levels, and the level of financial sector development. We then project future trends in <b>domestic</b> <b>saving</b> rates in developing Asia for the 2011 - 2030 period based on our estimation results and find that the <b>domestic</b> <b>saving</b> rate in developing Asia as a whole will remain roughly constant during the next two decades despite rapid population aging in some economies in developing Asia because population aging will occur much later in other economies and because the negative impact of population aging on the <b>domestic</b> <b>saving</b> rate will be largely offset by the positive impact of higher income levels. ...|$|R

In this study, both qualitative explanations and econometric analysis are used. The qualitative (descriptive) part of the analysis shows that average <b>domestic</b> <b>saving</b> in Ethiopia was low and continuously falling. In the econometric analysis, effort has been made to identify the long run and short run determinants of <b>domestic</b> <b>saving</b> in Ethiopia using Johnson Maximum Likelihood co-integration test and Vector error correction mechanism (VECM). Estimated results reveal that growth rate of GDP, government consumption and foreign aid are statistically significant long run determinants of <b>domestic</b> <b>saving</b> in Ethiopia. On the other hand, deposit interest rate, dependency ratio, and financial depth are found to be insignificant determinants. However, in the short run, all the explanatory variables included in this study do not have statistically significant meaning in explaining <b>domestic</b> <b>saving</b> in Ethiopia. The speed of adjustment has value 0. 585743 with negative sign, which shows the convergence of saving model towards long run equilibrium. By considering the significant as well as insignificant but very important variables to enhance domestic saving: Sustainable economic growth, increasing private sector participation as well as selective privatization of government owned institutions, expansion of financial intermediaries and creating competitive environment in the financial sector are suggested to improve <b>domestic</b> <b>saving</b> in Ethiopia.
