5000|$|In recent years, many indexed annuities can {{be issued}} with a rider {{designed}} to supply a lifetime income payment to the policyholder {{that does not}} require annuitization, thus leaving the policyholder {{in control of the}} balance of the account. These [...] "income riders" [...] are calculated separately than the indexed annuity itself, however, they use the same initial premium figures for each calculation. An [...] "income rider" [...] generally will provide a specified accumulation rate which is guaranteed for a certain period of years. The [...] "income rider" [...] calculations create an [...] "income pool" [...] which is strictly an accounting figure that cannot be accessed as a single lump sum by the policyholder or beneficiary. The [...] "income pool" [...] continues to grow annually at the specified accumulation rate until such time the <b>guarantee</b> <b>period</b> expires or the policyholder opts to begin taking [...] "lifetime income payments" [...] from the account. Once [...] "lifetime income payments" [...] begin, the [...] "income pool" [...] stops accumulating, and the value of the income pool is used to determine the amount of income that will be paid out annually (it can usually be paid monthly, quarterly or semi-annually as well). The amount of income produced by the [...] "income rider" [...] will depend on several factors, primarily the age of the policyholder at the time they opt for income, the specified accumulation rate and the length of time the [...] "income pool" [...] has been given to accumulate. Each time an income payment is paid to the policyholder, the indexed annuity account value is decreased by that same amount. [...] "Income riders" [...] that provide lifetime income are generally used as a means of allowing a policyholder to supplement their income, especially in retirement, without the possibility of outliving their money because even if the indexed annuity's account value falls to zero, the income payment from the [...] "income rider" [...] will continue until the death of the policyholder. If the policyholder dies and funds remain in the indexed annuity account value, those funds would be paid to the beneficiary(-ies). Some of these income riders are offered with no fees, while others carry an annual fee (generally 1% or less) which is deducted directly from the indexed annuity account value.|$|E

40|$|A unique {{feature of}} the initial public {{offering}} (IPO) market in Malaysia during 1996 - 1999 was the imposition of IPO profit guarantees for a three-year period subsequent to listing on the major shareholders of the newly listed Second Board companies. This study investigated the income smoothing behavior on a sample of 92 IPO companies with profit guarantees, of which 54 of them reported profit guarantee surpluses. For each of the companies, Eckel's income smooting Index (1981) {{is calculated based on}} two subperiods i. e.

We argue that the controlling shareholders need not resort to income smooting to avoid the costly profit guarantee shortfall as they could easily seek variations in the original profit guarantee agreement. Further analyses show that income smoothing is more prevalent among smaller companies and construction companies, based on a ten-year period but not the profit <b>guarantee</b> <b>period...</b>|$|E

The movement of items between source and destination consists {{of a combination of}} different modes of travel with varying speeds (i. e. trucks, airplanes etc.). Decisions have to be made regarding location of accumulation points (called local centers) at which changes in the mode of travel occur. All customers have to be allocated to these local centers so as to provide the best (minimum) time guarantee for travel between every source-destination pair. Accumulated flows between local centers pass through a global center in a centralized sorting system (CSS) and move directly between local centers in a decentralized sorting system (DSS). For tree structured distribution systems we provide polynomial time algorithms that locate a given number of local centers, allocate customers to local centers and provide the best possible time guarantee for both centralized and decentralized guaranteed time distribution systems. guaranteed time distribution, location network...|$|R
40|$|Plausible {{evaluations}} {{concerning the}} reliability and operating costs of Wind Turbines (WTs) can be determined only {{after several years of}} operation. The German subsidy measure " 250 MW Wind" is accompanied by a scientific programme, which evaluates the technical and financial experiences of the supported WTs. The programme began in 1989, so that the long experience of several turbines is now available. In the following, it is shown that technical availability of WTs increased significantly in the first operational years. Down times, following malfunctions of certain components, were especially reduced by improved service. The increasing availability, however, can also be traced to decreasing failure rates in early operation. The annual number of malfunctions in the fifth year of operation, is only half as high as in the first year. Obviously, insufficient constructions and faulty fabrications could be corrected in this time. Operating costs, however, do not follow this tendency.

40|$|Cognitive Radio (CR) is {{a dynamic}} {{spectrum}} access approach, in which unlicensed users (or secondary users, SUs) exploit the underutilized channels (or white spaces) owned by the licensed users (or primary users, PUs). Traditionally, SUs are oblivious to PUs, and therefore the acquisition of white spaces is not guaranteed. Hence, a SU must vacate its channel whenever a PU reappears on it in an unpredictablemanner,which may affect the SUs’ network performance. Spectrumleasing has been proposed to tackle the aforementioned problem through negotiation between the PU and SU networks, which allows the SUs to acquire white spaces for a <b>guaranteed</b> <b>period</b> of time. Through spectrumleasing, the PUs and SUs enhance their network performances, and additionally PUs maximize their respective monetary gains.
