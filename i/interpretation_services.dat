5|$|The {{second half}} of the 20th century saw {{increasingly}} sophisticated educational, visitor service, and <b>interpretation</b> <b>services.</b> Botanical gardens started to cater for many interests and their displays reflected this, often including botanical exhibits on themes of evolution, ecology or taxonomy, horticultural displays of attractive flowerbeds and herbaceous borders, plants from different parts of the world, special collections of plant groups such as bamboos or roses, and specialist glasshouse collections such as tropical plants, alpine plants, cacti and orchids, as well as the traditional herb gardens and medicinal plants. Specialised gardens like the Palmengarten in Frankfurt, Germany (1869), one of the world's leading orchid and succulent plant collections, have been very popular. There was a renewed interest in gardens of indigenous plants and areas dedicated to natural vegetation.|$|E

25|$|Sign {{language}} <b>interpretation</b> <b>services</b> via VRS or by VRI {{are useful}} in the present-day {{where one of the}} parties is deaf, hard-of-hearing or speech-impaired (mute). In such cases the interpretation flow is normally within the same principal language, such as French Sign Language (LSF) to spoken French, Spanish Sign Language (LSE) to spoken Spanish, British Sign Language (BSL) to spoken English, and American Sign Language (ASL) also to spoken English (since BSL and ASL are completely distinct to each other), and so on.|$|E
25|$|In Finland, the {{standard}} rate of VAT is 24% as of 1 January 2013 (raised from previous 23%), {{along with all}} other VAT rates, excluding the zero rate. In addition, two reduced rates are in use: 14% (up from previous 13% starting 1 January 2013), which is applied on food and animal feed, and 10%, (increased from 9% 1 January 2013) which is applied on passenger transportation services, cinema performances, physical exercise services, books, pharmaceuticals, entrance fees to commercial cultural and entertainment events and facilities. Supplies of some goods and services are exempt under the conditions defined in the Finnish VAT Act: hospital and medical care; social welfare services; educational, financial and insurance services; lotteries and money games; transactions concerning bank notes and coins used as legal tender; real property including building land; certain transactions carried out by blind persons and <b>interpretation</b> <b>services</b> for deaf persons. The seller of these tax-exempt services or goods {{is not subject to}} VAT and does not pay tax on sales. Such sellers therefore may not deduct VAT included in the purchase prices of his inputs. Åland, an autonomous area, is considered to be outside the EU VAT area, even if its VAT rate is the same as for Finland. Goods brought from Åland to Finland or other EU countries is considered to be export/import. This enables tax free sales onboard passenger ships.|$|E

[...] Some of these factors include different access to services, access to insurance or other means to pay for services, access to adequate language and <b>interpretation</b> <b>services,</b> and geographic availability of different services.

2500|$|According to {{the laws}} on civil and {{administrative}} procedure enacted in Ukraine in 2005, all legal and court proceedings in Ukraine are to be conducted in Ukrainian. This does not restrict, however, the usage of other languages, as the law guarantees <b>interpretation</b> <b>services</b> for any language desired by a citizen, defendant or witness. [...] Nonetheless, on September 6, 2005, the Russian Foreign Ministry criticised the measure, issuing a statement that the change infringes {{on the rights of}} Russian-speaking Ukrainian citizens. [...] In response, the First Deputy Foreign Minister of Ukraine, Volodymyr Ohryzko, expressed his astonishment at the Russian Foreign Ministry's commentary. [...] In his statement, he cited provisions of Russian law stating that the Russian language is used Russia-wide by every body of state authority and local self-government, as well as by public organisations. Ohryzko asserted that this matter is solely Ukraine's own affair.|$|E
2500|$|Patient-Physician {{communication}} involves two sides. While {{physicians and}} other healthcare providers are being encouraged or {{required to be}} culturally competent in delivery of quality healthcare, it would be reasonable to encourage patients as well to be culturally sensitive and be aware that not all health care providers are equally competent in cultures. When it comes to illness, cultural beliefs and values affect greatly a patient's behavior in seeking healthcare. They should try their best to communicate their concerns relating to their beliefs, values and other cultural factors that might affect care and treatment to their physicians and other healthcare providers. If effective communication is unlikely achieved, then they should be provided with language assistance and <b>interpretation</b> <b>services.</b> Recognizing that patients receive the best care when they work in partnership with doctors, the General Medical Council issued guidance for patients [...] "What to expect from your doctor: a guide for patients" [...] in April 2013.|$|E

A platform that generates service execution methods by combining context interpretation information is proposed. The semantic constraint is introduced {{as a part of}} the service definition. It generates appropriate service execution methods by specifying how to use the context and it also improves processing performance.
