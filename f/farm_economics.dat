40|$|Traditional {{objects of}} farm {{management}} research and farm management science are farms and farm households. In {{the course of}} time new objects have been added, for example different forms of horizontal and vertical co-operation, commerce and manufacturing enterprises in the field of agriculture, partly supplying, and service industries in agriculture. Corresponding to that, there are numerous addressees: relevant academics, students, farmers and their consultants, agricultural experts, also increasingly employees in agribusiness, agricultural societies and administrations, partly also jurisdiction, agrarian politicians, and finally the public. There is a large variety of topics concerning farm management research and science. Important traditional topics with varying focuses are: description of forms of enterprises, operations research and analysis, cooperate planning, appraisal, site assessment, use of electronic media, analysis of new technologies and their results, and finally the individual farm analysis of agrarian policy measures. Recent topics are in particular: economic research on organic farming, farm economic questions in connection with biotechnology and genetic engineering, farm economic controlling, internal procuring and marketing policy, business relations, analysis of international competitiveness of farm businesses as well as enterprises in agribusiness, farm environmental economy, and economic examinations of agricultural institutions. As far as organisation is concerned, <b>farm</b> management <b>economics</b> should stay in future within agricultural faculties. <b>Farm</b> management <b>economics</b> should not be classified as part of business economics and should not be integrated in business science faculties. Due to the large field of topics, <b>farm</b> management <b>economics</b> should have two professorships per faculty. Besides, a basic level of science has to be passed at any agricultural university.

30|$|Furthermore, the foliar {{applications}} of vermiwash reduced {{the incidence of}} capsule malformation. This relatively healthier, higher yield and a lesser malformed fruit incidence {{can be attributed to}} the presence of certain micro-nutrient as calcium, magnesium, manganese, copper, boron, iron, amino acids and silicic acid in vermiwash (Jarecki et al. 2005).Yield of the Linseed oil from the crop is positively co-related to the seed number and the seed weight per capsule per plant. Thus, high seed and capsule number will increase gains from Linseed. Organically grown Linseed in no way has negative effect on <b>farming</b> <b>economics,</b> as the positive increase in marketable yield is there in organic Linseed production.|$|R

50|$|After the Balfour {{declaration}} by Great Britain in 1917 and {{the award}} of the mandate to Palestine by the League of Nations to Britain, the Jewish Agency established in 1921 the Agricultural Experiment Station. Their {{mission was to}} conduct research leading to small farms with intensive agriculture, specializing in mixed farming of fruit trees, cattle, chicken, vegetables and cereals. The research station, headed by I. Elazari-Volcani and located in Rehovot, was the first scientific institute in Palestine. It had departments for crop sciences, fruit and citrus, soil and irrigation, entomology and plant pathology, post-harvest, food technology and <b>farm</b> <b>economics.</b> The station had an extension department and results of its research were quickly {{passed on to the}} farmers. Yields of grain under dryland conditions increased from 600 to 5000 kg per hectare; and breeding and selection of cattle increased milk production from 800-1500 kg to 5000 kg/cow/year (1950) {now more than 11.000 kg/cow/year- 2005}.

50|$|In 1942 {{there was}} some {{pioneering}} {{in the development and}} use of contour banks, the equipment required a team 4 horses or two Clydesdales, a teamster and two labourers. Through the 1950s Avondale had monitored its sheep flocks as part of the research into Dwalganup strain of clover as a livestock feed and its effect on ewe fertility. On into the 1960s and 1970s Avondale was involved with the breeding and trial of various cereal crops for use within Western Australia. Since the early 1980s Avondale has focused on environmental and sustainable farming along with farm income supplemental alternatives like marron farming.Avondale like most Western Australian farms utilised horses and Clydesdales in particular for pulling farming equipment. <b>Farm</b> <b>economics</b> of the 1930s meant that the Clydesdales weren't retired to enjoy the governments grassy paddocks. In 1937 a letter to the Agricultural minister details the disposal of horses that were no longer useful; center With regard to the two horses at the station which are old and incapable of any further work. I request approval for these animals, instead of being destroyed at the station, to be made available to the Zoo authorities for lions food... The letter details how the Perth Zoo is responsible for the freight and that the Minister had approved the transaction. Many Clydesdales were to follow the first two bay mares with the consignment note description for lions food, freight payable by consignee. This practice continued until well into the 1950s until tractors replaced the use of horses in farming. Since the opening of the museum in 1978 Avondale again utilised Clydesdales for demonstrations of the old equipment these horse are sold as pets once they are incapable of working.|$|E
5000|$|From 1909 to 1910 he {{assisted}} the Bureau of the Census to plan its {{schedule for the}} agricultural census, {{as well as for}} a special census of plantations. Taylor chose to join the United States Department of Agriculture for the chance at giving a national role to agricultural economics, even though the new position meant a large reduction in salary. He moved to Washington D.C. in 1919 to take charge of the USDA's Office of Farm Management and <b>Farm</b> <b>Economics.</b> Not long after his arrival in Washington, the wartime prices of farm products collapsed, which proved disastrous for a great number of farmers. In 1920, President Harding appointed Henry C. Wallace, who knew Taylor and was himself a great supporter of farmers, as the new Secretary of Agriculture. Taylor soon became Chief of the Bureau of Markets and Crop Estimates, while also being part of a commission to reorganize the offices of the USDA. For him this was a chance to consolidate the economics work of the department which had been scattered through many offices. In 1922, Wallace appointed him chief of the new Bureau of Agricultural Economics, which subsumed the former Office of Farm Management and Bureau of Markets and Crop Estimates (today the Agricultural Research Service and Agricultural Marketing Service). Among Taylor's tasks in the USDA were the expansion of agricultural information services, creating foreign outposts for the USDA to better collect information on world production and consumption, standardizing the grading of exported American crops, especially cotton, and inaugurating the Agricultural Outlook Service. [...] He also brought many talented new people into the USDA. Among them, two of his Ph.D. students he had already sent to work with Spillman, Oscar C. Stine and Oliver Edwin Baker, and Lewis Cecil Gray, who he persuaded to go with him to Washington.|$|E
