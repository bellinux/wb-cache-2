25|$|Of the 27 {{books in}} the New Testament, 14 have been {{attributed}} to Paul; 7 of these are widely considered authentic and Paul's own, while the authorship of the other 7 is disputed. The undisputed letters are considered the most important sources since they contain what everyone agrees to be Paul's own statements about his life and thoughts. Theologian Mark Powell writes that Paul directed these 7 letters to specific occasions at particular churches. As an example, if the Corinthian church had not experienced problems concerning its celebration of the Lord's Supper, today we would not know that Paul even believed in that observance or had any opinions about <b>it</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> or the other. He asks if we might be ignorant of other matters simply because no crises arose that prompted Paul to comment on them.|$|E
500|$|The Joker {{serves as}} an {{unreliable}} narrator. He admits to his own uncertainty, as he has disparate memories of the single event ("Sometimes I remember <b>it</b> <b>one</b> <b>way,</b> sometimes another... If I'm {{going to have a}} past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!"), accentuating the comic's depiction of [...] "a world unraveling toward relentless urban violence and moral nihilism..." ...|$|E
500|$|Though {{a number}} of backstories have been given, a {{definitive}} one {{has not yet been}} established for the Joker. An unreliable narrator, the character is uncertain of who he was before and how he became the Joker: [...] "Sometimes I remember <b>it</b> <b>one</b> <b>way,</b> sometimes another... if I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!" [...] A story about the Joker's origin appeared in Detective Comics #168 (February 1951), nearly a decade after the character's debut. Here, the character is a laboratory worker who becomes the Red Hood (a masked criminal) to steal a million dollars from his employer and retire. He falls into a vat of chemical waste when his heist is thwarted by Batman, emerging with bleached white skin, red lips, green hair and a permanent grin.|$|E

500|$|Review {{aggregator}} Metacritic {{shows an}} average score rating of 76 out of 100 {{for both the}} PS2 and Xbox versions, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". Marc Saltzman of CNN wrote: [...] "Unlike Hollywood horror movies that often get worse with each new sequel ("," [...] for example), Konami's scary Silent Hill series gets better -- and creepier -- with age." [...] Video game magazine Game Informer praised Silent Hill 4: The Room, stating that its [...] "disarming voyeurism, bizarre camera angles, and exceptionally well-placed tension is what the series {{has been trying to}} do all along, but The Room is the first entry to do it right." [...] According to a reviewer for Edge magazine, [...] "ook at <b>it</b> <b>one</b> <b>way,</b> and it's a choking journey with unprecedented attention to unease and psychological horror, a game framed with unparalleled sophistication. From another angle, it's just a clunky PSone throwback, with all the design wit of a dodo." [...] The New York Times found it completely lacking in [...] "true terror." ...|$|E

2500|$|Most {{academic}} {{criticism of}} the book has sought to appropriate <b>it</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> or the other; critics like Bernard Benstock, who argued that O'Brien's embrace of myth and refusal of realism [...] "ensnare him with the second rank", {{have been in the}} minority. Vivian Mercier described it in The Irish Comic Tradition as [...] "the most fantastic novel written by an Irishman in the twentieth century– with the doubtful exception of Finnegans Wake." [...] Rüdiger Imhof has noted how works by B.S. Johnson, Gilbert Sorrentino, Alasdair Gray and John Fowles carry explicit references to At Swim-Two-Birds. Michael Cronin draws attention to the metafictional and game-playing elements of the book, comparing it to the fictions of Raymond Queneau, and responds to criticism that the book is insufficiently respectful of realist conventions:Contrary to what Benstock argues, what post-independence Ireland needed was not less but more of the type of playful, self-aware writing being proposed by Flann O'Brien in At Swim-Two-Birds.... We would all be very much poorer without Mad O'Brien's narrative chessmen.Keith Hopper has argued that, contrary to the common tendency to favour At Swim-Two-Birds as [...] "the primary defining text of the O'Brien oeuvre", the novel is in fact less, not more, experimental than O'Brien's second novel, the posthumously published The Third Policeman:At Swim-Two-Birds is best considered as a late-modernist, transitional text which critiques both realism and modernism in an openly deconstructive manner, and in the process comes to the brink of an exciting new aesthetic. I will argue that the metafictional techniques developed publicly in ... are imbricated and embedded within the texture of The Third Policeman.|$|E
