5|$|During the Camillan era, {{they fought}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shallow</b> phalanx formation, {{supported}} by light troops. In most battles triarii {{were not used}} because the lighter troops usually defeated the enemy before the triarii were committed to the battle. They {{were meant to be}} used as a decisive force in the battle, thus prompting an old Roman saying: 'It comes down to the triarii' (res ad triarios venit), which meant carrying on to the bitter end.|$|E
5|$|Nankoweap Formation {{is around}} 1050million {{years old and}} {{is not part of}} a group. This rock unit is made of {{coarse-grained}} sandstone, and was deposited <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shallow</b> sea on top of the eroded surface of the Cardenas Basalt. The Nankoweap is only exposed {{in the eastern part of}} the canyon. A gap in the geologic record, an unconformity, follows the Nankoweap.|$|E

5|$|No {{consensus}} {{has been}} reached on the exact depositional nature of the Irati oil shale. One theory suggests that the organic material in the Irati oil shale originated from algae deposited in a lacustrine environment with salinity varying from that of freshwater to brackish water. Other theory suggests that the organic sediment may have been deposited <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shallow,</b> partially restricted marine environment. Hutton's classification describes it as a marine source oil shale.|$|E
5|$|The pyramid has a T-shaped {{substructure}} with a descending corridor {{leading to}} a chamber with a gabled roof.

5|$|Another {{structure}} at {{the complex}} {{is a small}} signal house, which was constructed as a flag house for the timber flagstaff, both constructed with the original structures in 1903. The flag house was constructed to match the lighthouse, from precast concrete blocks, rendered walls, with the same plinth and deep ashlar coursing. The roof is made of concrete <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shallow</b> hipped form, {{in contrast to the}} concrete dome proposed in the original drawings. The flag locker now houses maritime signal flags. The timber flagstaff was removed at an unknown date, and what remains of it are a concrete and steel base, a concrete apron, and four concrete and iron anchor points.|$|E

5|$|Further south {{there are}} newer Middle and Late Devonian rocks, known as Ilfracombe beds and Morte Slates. These include {{sandstone}} and limestone, {{which have been}} quarried near Aisholt. At Great Holwell, south of Aisholt, is the only limestone cave in the Devonian limestone of North Devon and West Somerset. The lower fringes around the hills are composed of younger New Red Sandstone rocks of the Triassic period. These rocks were laid down <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shallow</b> sea and often contain irregular masses or veins of gypsum, which was mined on the foreshore at Watchet.|$|E

NSA agents ransack the Morris household, looking for any other documentation that might supposedly compromise national security. After the Morrises are taken into custody (which causes Darlene to lose her trust towards Mulder and Scully), Mulder examines the charred roof of their RV, prompting him to head to Lake Okobogee. There, the agents discover sand turned to glass and a burned tree line, indicating the presence of a massive heat source.

5|$|Ninety-seven British {{prisoners were}} killed and the Germans forced French civilians to bury the bodies <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shallow</b> mass grave the next day. Despite the German efforts, Private William O'Callaghan had survived and pulled Private Albert Pooley alive from among the bodies in the field. The pair then hid in a pig-sty {{for three days and}} nights, {{surviving}} on raw potatoes and water from puddles before being discovered by the farm's owner, Madame Duquenne-Creton, and her son Victor. The French civilians risked their lives caring for the two men, who were later captured by the Wehrmacht's 251st Infantry Division and transferred to a military hospital.|$|E
5|$|Rodes {{initially}} sent three brigades south against Union {{troops that}} represented the right {{flank of the}} I Corps and the left flank of the XI Corps: from east to west, Brig. Gen. George P. Doles, Col. Edward A. O'Neal, and Brig. Gen. Alfred Iverson. Doles's Georgia brigade stood guarding the flank, awaiting the arrival of Early's division. Both O'Neal's and Iverson's attacks fared poorly against the six veteran regiments in the brigade of Brig. Gen. Henry Baxter, manning a line <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shallow</b> inverted V, facing north on the ridge behind the Mummasburg Road. O'Neal's men were sent forward without coordinating with Iverson on their flank and fell back under heavy fire from the I Corps troops.|$|E
50|$|The yacht {{remained}} in Sydney, passing through several owners. These owners made many changes, including progressive {{reduction of the}} rig and loss of 4 ft off the stern.

40|$|The biostratinomy of Silurian {{cephalopod}} limestone biofacies of the Prague Basin is interpreted. Two facies {{types are}} recognized.

Orientation of cephalopod shells in these two facies types is discussed in relation to the Prague Basin development and to phenomena like telescoping, trap-structures and geopetal structures...|$|R
5|$|The Soviets shelled {{the area}} {{in and around the}} Reich Chancellery on and off during the afternoon. SS guards brought over {{additional}} cans of petrol to further burn the corpses. Linge later noted the fire did not completely destroy the remains, as the corpses were being burned in the open, where the distribution of heat varies. The corpses burned from 16:00 to 18:30. At approximately 18:30, Lindloff and Reisser covered up the remains <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shallow</b> bomb crater.|$|E
5|$|The second {{prototype}} was canceled, so {{the first}} service test aircraft was built and flown. This was fitted with the J46 engines, which performed below specification. However, speeds in excess of Mach1 were attained <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shallow</b> dive with this aircraft, making it the only supersonic seaplane to date. On 4 November 1954, Sea Dart BuNo 135762 disintegrated in midair over San Diego Bay during a demonstration for naval officials and the press, killing Convair test pilot Charles E. Richbourg when he inadvertently exceeded the airframe's limitations. Richbourg was a 31-year-old Navy veteran of the Second World War. He was quickly pulled from the water but did not survive the airframe breakage. He was buried in St. Augustine National Cemetery in Florida.|$|E

5|$|Brady and Hindley {{visited a}} {{fairground}} on 26 December 1964, {{in search of}} another victim, and noticed 10-year-old Lesley Ann Downey standing beside one of the rides. When {{it became apparent that}} she was on her own, they approached her and deliberately dropped some of the shopping they were carrying close to her, before asking for the girl's help to carry some of the packages to their car, and then to their home. Once inside the house Downey was undressed, gagged and forced to pose for photographs before being raped and killed, perhaps strangled with a piece of string. Hindley maintained that she went to fill a bath for the child and found the girl dead (presumably killed by Brady) when she returned. In Chris Cowley's book Face to Face with Evil: Conversations with Ian Brady, Brady states that it was Hindley who killed Downey. The following morning Brady and Hindley drove with Downey's body to Saddleworth Moor, where she was buried, naked with her clothes at her feet, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shallow</b> grave.|$|E
5|$|From {{its origin}} to Birdwood the river follows rolling, {{relatively}} level country before entering a hilly section {{that continues to}} Gumeracha. The river then follows sedimentary rock strata before entering a gorge after Cudlee Creek. It flows through the gorge to Athelstone, passing over the Eden Fault Zone of the Adelaide Hills face and associated escarpment. After the scarp it flows over sedimentary rocks of varying resistance to erosion, {{which has led to}} interspersed narrows and broad basins. From the base of the Adelaide Hills to Adelaide's central business district it runs <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>shallow</b> valley with a terraced floor, then down the slope of its own alluvial fan. The structure of this fan shows that the river formerly entered Gulf St Vincent via the Port River. Over time the Torrens deposited sediment, choking its own outflow; becoming locked behind coastal sand dunes and forming the swampy areas of the Cowandilla Plains and the reedbeds.|$|E
