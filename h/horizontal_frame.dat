500|$|In November 1866, {{following}} their successful collaboration on the numbering machine, Sholes asked Soule {{to join him}} and Glidden in developing the new device. Mathias Schwalbach, a German clockmaker, was hired to assist with construction. To test the proposed machine's feasibility, a key was taken from a telegraph machine and modified to print the letter [...] "W"; by September 1867, a model with a full alphabet, numbers, and rudimentary punctuation had been completed, and {{it was used to}} compose letters to acquaintances in the hope of selling the invention, or procuring funds for its manufacture. One recipient, James Densmore, immediately bought a 25% interest for $600, the cost of the machine's development to that date. Densmore saw the machine {{for the first time in}} March 1868, and was unimpressed; he thought it clumsy and impractical, and declared it [...] "good for nothing except to show that its underlying principles were sound". Among other deficiencies, the device held paper in a <b>horizontal</b> <b>frame,</b> which limited the thickness of the paper that could be used and made alignment difficult. A patent for the [...] "Type-Writer" [...] was granted on June23, 1868, and, despite the device's flaws, Densmore rented a building in Chicago in which to begin its manufacture. Fifteen units were produced before a lack of funds forced the venture back to Milwaukee.|$|E
2500|$|The {{two main}} {{problems}} facing Parnall when given an Air Ministry contract to produce such an aircraft were to ensure that, {{so far as}} possible the behaviour of the wing was unaffected by interference with the flow over the fuselage or by prop wash, and to devise a way of measuring lift and drag forces whilst in flight. [...] They decided on a parasol wing design, since this would avoid complications like wing root interference, and made the wing mounting structure into a single unit with some freedom to deflect internally so that the force could be measured. [...] A typical parasol wing aircraft has lift struts from the lower fuselage to the wing plus some upper fuselage struts to support the wing near the centre line. The Parasol had two lift struts under each wing, with their lower ends joined within the fuselage to a horizontal rectangular frame. Two inverted V members were also attached to this frame, one at the front and one at the back, rising almost vertically {{to the front and}} rear wing spars. [...] The V-struts were hinged top and bottom, allowing the wing to move parallel to the <b>horizontal</b> <b>frame</b> under aerodynamic loads. The force was measured by a dynamometer ahead of the front cockpit, via a linkage which ran down and forward from the wing at an angle of about 22°, then turned back to the instrument via a crank.|$|E

50|$|It is {{believed}} that during the occupancy of Isaac Moore at Kenilworth from 1863 until 1875, the early homestead was constructed. The present owners of the house believe the date {{to be closer to}} 1865. The construction of the building has been attributed by descendants of the Moore family to two cabinet-makers from Orkney Islands. The high quality of the finish of the internal timber work and the unusual construction technique support this proposition.

From left and right the archangels Michael and Gabriel rush to the seated mother and her child. The whole scene takes place under a three-arched arcade. The triptych is flanked by two departments which display, in three horizontal lines each, a total of 25 male and female saints standing next to one other. All figures except the Child Jesus are identifiable by name. A frame displaying a series of head medallions without inscriptions runs all around the triptych and the two lateral sections. In the upper <b>horizontal</b> <b>frame</b> piece Christ and John the Baptist {{as well as the}} four Evangelists are depicted. In its lower counterpart Pellegrino II, kneeling at the feet of Mary, can be identified by an accompanying inscription as the donator of the altarpiece. On the inside of the two frame boards a votive inscription composed of ten Leonine verses runs horizontally across the altarpiece.|$|E
50|$|In {{a flying}} spot scanner (FSS) or {{cathode-ray}} tube (CRT) telecine, a pixel-sized light beam is projected through exposed and developed motion picture film (either negative or positive) and collected by a special type of photo-electric cell known as a photomultiplier which converts the light into an electrical signal. The beam of light “scans” across the film image {{from left to right}} to record the <b>horizontal</b> <b>frame</b> information. Vertical scanning of the frame is then accomplished by moving the film past the CRT beam. In a colour telecine the light from the CRT passes through the film and is separated by dichroic mirrors and filters into red, green and blue bands. Photomultiplier tubes or avalanche photodiodes convert the light into separate red, green and blue electrical signals for further electronic processing. This can be accomplished in “real time”, 24 frames per second (or in some cases faster). Rank Precision-Cintel introduced the “Mark” series of FSS telecines. During this time advances were also made in CRTs, with increased light output producing a better signal-to-noise ratio and so allowing negative film to be used.|$|E

Three-dimensional beam elements and bar elements are employed for vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>frames</b> {{as well as the}} tie rods, respectively, to build up the numerical model.

The dynamic responses of displacement, velocity and accelerations of a typical node of the tower crane frame are illustrated and discussed. The numerical simulation results show that the maximal displacements might be large to over 1 meter and the associated maximal velocity and acceleration can be greater than 4 m/s and 40 m/s 2, respectively at the highest position of tower crane...|$|R

The discrepancies between these free vibration characteristics of the first nine modes calculated from different analysis programs are small than 10 %, and thus can be accepted in the sense of engineering application. There exist additional vibration modes with high frequency predicted by different software...|$|R

50|$|Instead of {{the complex}} {{transverse}} horizontal drive {{it was decided to}} use a vertical longitudinal rear-engined layout, Instead of the very low <b>horizontal</b> <b>frame</b> of the first two chassis, this was slightly higher at the front and ramped gently upward and tapered outward toward the rear, where the Cummins VIM V6-200 engine was mounted. This 9.6-litre 90-degree vee-six engine developed 192 bhp at 2600rpm and was compact enough to fit under the rear seat on a bodied bus and allow drive to pass through a conventional Daimler SCG Daimatic four-speed semi-automatic gearbox to a straight spiral-bevel rear axle manufactured by Eaton, an electrically operated two-speed axle being optional. All round air suspension was standard, with rubber and steel leaf options. Although some drawings show a front-mounted radiator, standard production versions had this mounted on the rear offside, as on the Fleetline. Other components such as the front axle, steering, brakes, driving controls etc. were {{similar to those of the}} Fleetline. The model was announced as the Roadliner model SRC6-36, this was the third and last Daimler bus chassis to be given a model name as well as an alphanumeric code.|$|E

The purpose of the present numerical study was to determine, in a basic way, how the relative size of a single <b>horizontal</b> <b>frame</b> member mounted in the center of the window affects this convective heat transfer rate. A recessed window has been considered. The flow has been assumed to be steady and both laminar and turbulent flows have been considered. Fluid properties have been assumed constant except for the density change with temperature that gives rise to the buoyancy forces, this being dealt with using the Boussinesq approach. The governing equations have been solved using the FLUENT commercial cfd code. The k-epsilon turbulence model with standard wall functions and with buoyancy force effects fully accounted for has been used in the calculations. The solution has the following parameters: the Rayleigh number, the Prandtl number, the dimensionless horizontal distance between the inner window surface and the inner surface of the wall in which the window is mounted (the dimensionless recess depth), and the dimensionless width and depth of the frame member. Results have only been obtained for a Prandtl number of 0. 74, which is effectively the value for air, and for single values of the dimensionless window recess depth and of the dimensionless frame height. The effects of the other dimensionless variables on the window Nusselt number have been numerically studied...|$|E
