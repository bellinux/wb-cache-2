25|$|March - <b>District</b> <b>Assembly</b> {{elections}} held.|$|E
25|$|Since 1998 {{there has}} been a degree of devolution, with District Assemblies {{established}} in the Tameside townships and consisting of the councillors and an advisory group. Assembly meetings are open to the public. Each Assembly has a town manager and devolved staff and budgets to deal with local services such as grounds maintenance, road repairs, parks, Britain in Bloom, community events, youth services, crime and disorder and town centre regeneration. The Denton and Audenshaw <b>District</b> <b>Assembly</b> controls an annual budget in excess of £1.5m. The old council chamber in Denton Town Hall was refurbished to provide a permanent home and meeting place for the Denton and Audenshaw <b>District</b> <b>Assembly</b> as the town's millennium project in 2000.|$|E
25|$|Jimmy Armfield OBE, England footballer. Freeman of the Borough of Blackpool, {{was born}} in Denton. Although he {{has spent most of}} his life in Blackpool, he was honoured by Tameside Council in July 2009 and was {{presented}} with a lifetime achievement award by Denton and Audenshaw <b>District</b> <b>Assembly.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>District</b> <b>Assemblies</b> and City <b>District</b> Government were {{introduced}} in 2000 by Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf. Musharraf announced holding of Community Government elections, which began from December 2000 at Union Council level {{and came to a}} completion with <b>District</b> <b>Assemblies,</b> elections on July, 2001.|$|R
5000|$|The {{designating}} assembly system designates {{candidates to}} be elected (at a primary election) as party nominees for public office. The county assembly chooses candidates to contest the primary election for county elected offices and elects members of the state <b>assembly</b> and <b>district</b> <b>assemblies</b> (congressional <b>assemblies,</b> judicial <b>district</b> <b>assemblies,</b> senatorial assemblies, and representative assemblies). The party's state assembly governs the party when it is in session. A precinct caucus is held in each precinct by each political party, where party members (who bother to show up) elect delegates to the county assembly.|$|R
50|$|In rural areas, {{the powers}} and {{resources}} of <b>District</b> <b>Assemblies</b> were strengthened through the Local Government Service Act 656 of 2003. The Act transferred {{the power to}} appoint, promote and discipline civil servants from the national government to the <b>District</b> <b>Assemblies.</b> Furthermore, in 2006 a Districts Development Fund was created to channel central government and donor funds in a transparent and effective way to <b>District</b> <b>Assemblies.</b> An Environmental, Health and Sanitation Directorate {{was created in the}} Ministry of Local Governments and Rural Development in 2009 in order to focus more on sanitation. In this context a program was launched to eliminate open defecation through community-led total sanitation.|$|R
25|$|District {{residents}} in Vienna (Austrians {{as well as}} EU citizens with permanent residence here) elect a <b>District</b> <b>Assembly</b> (Bezirksvertretung). City hall has delegated maintenance budgets, e.g., for schools and parks, so that the districts are able to set priorities autonomously. Any decision of a district can be overridden by the city assembly (Gemeinderat) or the responsible city councillor (amtsführender Stadrat).|$|E
25|$|Renfroe {{targeted}} Hall for, as {{a member}} of the legislature's Joint Budget Committee, being a vocal proponent of Colorado's Referendum C in 2005. The measure allowed the state to retain additional tax revenue, and Renfroe criticized the measure as unnecessary government spending. At the Republican party <b>district</b> <b>assembly</b> in April, Renfroe narrowly edged out Hall in delegate votes, earning the top spot on the primary ballot.|$|E
25|$|So great was the SLP's {{influence}} that {{the newly elected}} Sovereign promised to appoint {{a member of the}} party as editor of the Journal of the Knights of Labor. When he recanted on this pledge, a bitter feud erupted, ending with the December 1895 General Assembly refusing to seat de facto SLP party leader Daniel DeLeon as a delegate from <b>District</b> <b>Assembly</b> 49, resulting in an outright break of the two organizations and withdrawal of the greater part of the New York district from the organization, thereby hastening the Knights of Labor's demise.|$|E
50|$|This {{structure}} is mirrored {{on the local}} level, with the <b>District</b> <b>Assemblies,</b> Boards and Councils.|$|R
5000|$|The Local Government Act No. 462 of 1993 {{defined the}} use of powers of <b>District</b> <b>Assemblies</b> as the highest {{political}} authority in each District, headed by a District Chief Executive (similar to a mayor). Neither the constitution nor the Local Government Act clearly define the responsibities of <b>District</b> <b>Assemblies,</b> and initially they had no role in {{water supply and sanitation}} until they were partially transferred to them in 1999.|$|R
50|$|Hilmar {{will now}} belong to CA State <b>Assembly</b> <b>District</b> 21. CA State <b>Assembly</b> <b>District</b> 17 {{is now a}} Bay Area <b>assembly</b> <b>district.</b>|$|R
25|$|Despite its {{active role}} as {{cheerleader}} and publicist, the SLP {{was unable to}} exert any sort of real influence in the Knights of Labor until it was already in steep decline, toward {{the start of the}} 1890s, when it won effective control of the New York <b>District</b> <b>Assembly</b> of the K of L in 1893. In that same year, socialist delegates to the governing General Assembly of the K of L were largely responsible for the defeat of Terence Powderly and his replacement by J. R. Sovereign as Grand Master Workman, {{the chief executive officer of}} the organization.|$|E
25|$|The {{opposition}} {{came from}} white liberals who would contest A roll seats in general elections and from some black parties that would contest B roll seats. The main white opposition was the Rhodesia Party, associated with veteran liberal politician (and former <b>district</b> <b>Assembly</b> member) Dr Ahrn Palley. In the 1974 general election, Dr Palley came within 3 votes of taking Salisbury (City) from the RF. In that same election, Michael Auret took about 30% {{of the vote}} for the RP in Bulawayo (District). Auret later won Harare (Central) for the MDC in the Zimbabwe parliamentary elections, 2000.|$|E
500|$|Roberts' 2010 {{campaign}} for the Senate seat also faced a challenge in the Republican primary from former Norwood, Colorado town marshal Dean Boehler, who campaigns as a self-described [...] "true conservative;" [...] Boehler received 67 percent of delegate votes at the Republican <b>district</b> <b>assembly</b> to Roberts' 33, earning him the top spot on the August primary ballot. Roberts won the primary race with 54% of the vote {{and went on to}} win the general election with 61% of the vote.|$|E

50|$|In 1999, the {{responsibility}} to support communities {{in the provision of}} water supply and sanitation in more than 110 small towns and in rural areas was transferred to the <b>District</b> <b>Assemblies.</b> Sanitation also became a responsibility of the <b>District</b> <b>Assemblies,</b> both in urban and rural areas. Furthermore, the government pursued private sector participation in urban water supply {{with the assistance of the}} World Bank through preparatory studies and workshops, but without actually bringing in the private sector yet.|$|R
2500|$|Since its {{formation}} the <b>District</b> <b>Assembly</b> Chairs have been: Andrew Gwynne (1998–2001); Mike Craven (2001–2004); Allison Gwynne (2004–2005); Margaret Downs (2005–.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, Stack {{ran for the}} New Jersey Senate in {{the primary}} {{election}} for the Senate seat held by retiring State Senator Bernard Kenny, {{with a team of}} eight other 33rd <b>District</b> <b>Assembly</b> candidates vying for nine legislative seats, under the banner Democrats for Hudson County. Their main opposition was the Hudson County Democratic Organization (HCDO), which was headed by West New York Mayor and then-33rd Legislative <b>District</b> <b>Assembly</b> member Silverio Vega. [...] On June 5, 2007, Stack won the primary, beating his opponents by a wide margin of 18,213 votes to Vega's 5,582, though only three of the candidates in Stack's column, including himself, were victorious. Stack and running mates Ruben Ramos and Caridad Rodriguez subsequently swept the state Senate and state Assembly in the November 6, 2007 general election. He has served in the Senate since January 8, 2008. Stack was reelected on November 8, 2011, garnering 18,244 votes over opponent Beth Hamburger's 2,815 votes.|$|E
2500|$|Under the policy, foreign districts {{would be}} granted {{the same rights}} as US districts, with control passing from missionaries to local leaders. However, in 1919, all {{reference}} to the missionaries relinquishing control was removed, and the following substituted: [...] "The pastor and delegates from the self-supporting church to the <b>District</b> <b>Assembly</b> must be able to enter into the deliberations of the Assembly in the English language until such time as a self-supporting district may be formed." ...|$|E
50|$|In the elections, 9,759 city, {{county and}} <b>district</b> people's <b>assembly</b> deputies and 53,882 town, neighborhood, village and workers' <b>district</b> people's <b>assembly</b> deputies were elected.|$|R

2500|$|In the end, {{only four}} workers were ever tried {{on the actual}} charges filed on July 18. Three AA members were found {{innocent}} of all charges. Hugh Dempsey, {{the leader of the}} local Knights of Labor <b>District</b> <b>Assembly,</b> was found guilty of conspiring to poison nonunion workers at the plant—despite the state's star witness recanting his testimony on the stand. Dempsey served a seven-year prison term. [...] In February 1893, Knox and the union agreed to drop the charges filed against one another, and no further prosecutions emerged from the events at Homestead.|$|E
2500|$|The {{roots of}} the strike began in a pattern of labor actions, {{negotiations}} and temporary agreements all through 1885. [...] The Knights of Labor and Gould's Union Pacific had reached an agreement that included the principle that [...] "no man should be discharged without due notice and investigation." [...] This was purportedly violated when a Knight named Charles A. Hall in Marshall, Texas was fired for attending a union meeting on company time. [...] The <b>District</b> <b>Assembly</b> # 101 of the Knights, and its leader Martin Irons, called a strike.|$|E
2500|$|Stalybridge was twinned, in 1955, with Armentières, France. [...] In 1974 {{the area}} and assets of the Municipal Borough were {{combined}} with those of others districts, to form the Metropolitan Borough of Tameside. Stalybridge is currently represented by the occupants of nine of the 57 seats on the local Metropolitan Borough Council. These seats are spread over three wards: Stalybridge North, Stalybridge South and Dukinfield Stalybidge. Stalybridge currently has four Labour councillors and five Conservative councillors. Since 1998 the nine Stalybidge councillors have held meetings on a bimonthly basis, as the Stalybridge <b>District</b> <b>Assembly.</b>|$|E
40|$|This article appraises the {{prospects}} of <b>District</b> <b>Assemblies</b> institutionalising local governance structures and processes that are responsive, democratic and capable of improving the livelihoods of the poor. <b>District</b> <b>Assemblies</b> have been established {{against the backdrop of}} a radically reconstituted policy, governance and administrative framework following the transition from one-party rule to multiparty democracy in Malawi in May 1994. The underlying argument of this paper is that the potential success of the <b>District</b> <b>Assemblies</b> is effectively hampered by widespread self-seeking tendencies and orientations among various stakeholders in grassroots development, strategically veiled as lack of capacity {{on the part of the}} decentralised planning framework. Unless these seemingly idiosyncratic tendencies are subordinated to the underlying noble cause of the decentralisation policy and institutional reforms, the trinity of good governance, development and poverty reduction in the evolving structures and processes of local government will remain a virtually unattainable ideal. ...|$|R
50|$|During a 1982 drought, {{the council}} focused its {{attention}} on tree-planting {{and there was}} a national reforestation campaign in the wake of deforestation from 1972 into the 1980s. The EPC moved to the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development to work with <b>district</b> <b>assemblies</b> to ensure environmental sustainability. In 1983, the government introduced a National Bushfire Campaign to minimize the bushfires occurring throughout the country. The council conducted sensitization programmes, and officers traveled throughout the country to minimise bushfire occurrence in collaboration with <b>district</b> <b>assemblies</b> and the Ghana National Fire Service.|$|R
50|$|In the elections, 2,517 provincial people's {{assembly}} deputies, 14,303 city, {{county and}} <b>district</b> people's <b>assembly</b> deputies and 70,250 town, neighborhood, village and workers' <b>district</b> people's <b>assembly</b> deputies were elected.|$|R
2500|$|Local congregations {{are grouped}} {{administratively}} into geographical Districts. At the 2009 General Assembly a resolution was passed defining a district as [...] "an entity {{made up of}} interdependent local churches organized to facilitate the mission of each local church through mutual support, and sharing of resources, and collaboration." [...] Each district is led by a District Superintendent, who is usually elected by delegates from each local church in an annual meeting called the <b>District</b> <b>Assembly.</b> In embryonic districts, the District Superintendent may be appointed by the jurisdictional General Superintendent. There are currently 465 Districts worldwide. [...] In 2008 these were 174 are Phase 3 (regular districts); 85 are Phase 2; and 141 are Phase 1. There were also 33 pioneer areas. There are 80 Districts in the USA and Canada. The largest districts are Brazil Sudeste Paulista (24,686 full members), South Korea National District (23,143 members), India East (19,490 members), and Oklahoma (17,530), the largest district in the USA.|$|E
