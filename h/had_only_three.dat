5|$|The European tour in 1959 commemorated {{the centennial}} of the Glee Club. In {{addition}} to a four-week concert tour, the group competed in the International Eisteddfod in Llangollen, Wales, one of the world's most significant choral competitions. The boat the club were travelling on was nearly a day late arriving, nearly missing the competition, and they performed having <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>three</b> hours sleep.

5|$|The castle was not greatly used; the Marquess rarely visited {{after its}} completion. The {{property}} had probably only been intended for limited, informal use, for example as a retreat following picnics. Although it had reception rooms suitable for large gatherings, it <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>three</b> bedrooms and {{was too far}} from Cardiff for casual visits. The restored castle initially received little interest from the architectural community, possibly because the total rebuilding of the castle ran counter to the increasingly popular late-Victorian philosophy of conserving older buildings and monuments.|$|E
5|$|The first flexifuel {{vehicles}} {{were introduced in}} Spain by late 2007, with the acquisition of 80 cars {{for use in the}} Spaniard official government fleet. At that time the country <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>three</b> gas stations selling E85, making necessary to deploy an official E85 fueling station in Madrid to attend these vehicles. Despite the introduction in the Spaniard market of several flexifuel models, by the end of 2008 still persists the problems of adequate E85 fueling infrastructure, as only 10 gas stations were selling E85 fuel to the public in the entire country.|$|E
5|$|During this campaign, the 21st {{suffered}} heavy casualties {{during the}} Battle of Spotsylvania and the Battle of Bethesda Church. In the latter engagement, the 21st acted as rear guard and bore {{the brunt of}} a fierce attack but held their position. Grant's Overland Campaign concluded with several assaults on Petersburg, Virginia, on June 15–18, 1864. The 21st again took considerable casualties during these attacks, particularly during the assault on June 17. Maj. Henry Richardson, commanding the 21st, {{was wounded in the}} thigh during the engagement and was shortly thereafter sent home. Now numbering less than 100 men, the regiment had been reduced to a tenth of its original size. Company A, by this time, <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>three</b> men on its active roster.|$|E

5|$|Football was {{introduced}} to the university by W. G. Little in 1892. The first win {{in the history of the}} program came in its inaugural game, a 56–0 shutout over Birmingham High School on November 11, 1892. From 1892 to 1894, Alabama competed as a football independent, before they joined the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA) as a charter member in 1895. From 1895 to 1921, Alabama saw some success as they <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>three</b> losing seasons as a member of the SIAA. In 1922, Alabama left the SIAA and became a charter member of the Southern Conference (SoCon). As a member of the Southern Conference, Alabama won conference championships in 1924, 1925, 1926 and 1930. Additionally, Alabama won their first three National Championships in the 1925, 1926 and 1930 seasons.|$|E
5|$|In 1719 the Duke and Duchess {{were able}} {{to move into the}} east wing of the {{unfinished}} palace, but Marlborough <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>three</b> years to enjoy it. While living at Windsor Lodge he suffered another stroke in June 1722, not long after his 72nd birthday. Finally, at 4 a.m on 16 June (O.S.), in the presence of his wife and two surviving daughters Henrietta Godolphin and Mary Montagu, the 1st Duke of Marlborough died. He was initially buried in the vault at the east end of HenryVII's chapel in Westminster Abbey, but following instructions left by Sarah, who died in 1744, Marlborough was moved to be by her side lying in the vault beneath the chapel at Blenheim.|$|E
5|$|In {{its first}} year of service, an IK-3 was lost {{when one of the}} {{squadron}} commanders, Kapetan Anton Ercigoj, was making a mock attack on a Potez 25 over the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers. After passing below the Potez, he went into a climb with the intention of performing a loop. His rate of climb was too steep and the aircraft fell into a spin at low altitude and hit the water. Before the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in early April 1941, the 51st Fighter Group was placed under the 6th Fighter Regiment, which was responsible for the defence of Belgrade. The 51st Fighter Group was further reinforced the day before the invasion began, with the 102nd Fighter Squadron equipped with Bf 109Es. When the invasion began on 6 April, the two IK-3 squadrons <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>three</b> serviceable aircraft each.|$|E

5|$|Soviet {{citizens}} <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>three</b> {{days from}} 23 - 25 January to exchange their old 50 rouble and 100 rouble banknotes {{for the new}} currency. Exchange could be postponed, but only through specialized government commissions. Due to this short exchange window, long queues formed in front of Soviet savings banks, {{even though it was}} also possible to exchange money at workplaces and post offices. This reform also dealt a crippling blow to Soviet citizens who had saved their money and could not move fast enough to get it exchanged; some lost as much as 15,000 - 30,000 rubles overnight.|$|E
5|$|The {{immediate}} {{result of}} the battle was inconclusive, both squadrons retiring with one ship damaged apiece. French losses had been heavy, with 15 killed and 20 wounded on Prudente, the latter including Renaud and 22 killed and 62 wounded on Cybèle. One sailor was killed and five wounded on Jean-Bart and no casualties were reported on Courier. By contrast, Centurion <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>three</b> men killed and 23 wounded and Diomede none at all, but the damage to Osborne's ship was more problematic; while Renaud could repair and resupply his ships in nearby Port Louis, Centurion {{had to return to}} India, several thousand miles away, to affect repairs. Osborne was thus forced to abandon the blockade, with Centurion sailing to Bombay and Diomede to Madras.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} North American auto market, by 2007 Canada had {{available}} 51 {{models of}} E85 flex-vehicles, most from Chrysler, Ford and General Motors, including automobiles, pickup trucks, and SUVs. The country had around 1.6million capable flex fuel E85s on the roads by 2014. However, most users are not aware they own an E85, as vehicles are not clearly labeled as such, {{and even though the}} newer models have a yellow cap in the fuel tank informing that the vehicle can handle E85, most users are still not aware because there are hardly any gas stations offering E85. Another major restriction for greater E85 fuel use is the fact that by June 2008 Canada <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>three</b> public E85 pumps, all located in Ontario, in the cities of Guelph, Chatham, and Woodstock. E85 fueling is available primarily for fleet vehicles, including 20 government refueling stations not available for the public. The main feedstocks for E85 production in Canada are corn and wheat, and there were several proposals being discussed to increase the actual use of E85 fuel in FFVs, such as creating an ethanol-friendly highway or ethanol corridor.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{limitations}} of the Mark III Fat Man, a nuclear strike would have been a formidable undertaking in the post-war 1940s. The lead-acid batteries that powered the fuzing system remained charged for only 36 hours, after which they needed to be recharged. To do this meant disassembling the bomb, and recharging took 72 hours. The batteries had to be removed in any case after nine days or they corroded. The plutonium core could not be left in for much longer, because its heat damaged the high explosives. Replacing the core also required the bomb to be completely disassembled and reassembled. This required about 40 to 50 men and took between 56 and 72 hours, depending on the skill of the bomb assembly team, and in June 1948 the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>three</b> teams. The only aircraft capable of carrying the bomb were Silverplate B-29s, and the only group equipped with them was the 509th Bombardment Group at Walker Air Force Base in Roswell, New Mexico. They would first have to fly to Sandia Base to collect the bombs, and then to an overseas base from which a strike could be mounted.|$|E
5|$|Hamence {{made his}} debut on English {{soil in the}} second tour match against Leicestershire. Batting at No. 6, he came in at 4/344 and made only seven. His {{dismissal}} triggered a collapse of 5/38 as Australia were bowled out for 448 before winning by an innings. The next match against Yorkshire, on a damp pitch that suited slower bowling, was the closest Australia came to defeat on the tour. Batting at No. 4, Hamence made 12 in the first innings as Australia replied to Yorkshire's 71 with 101. He batted slowly, coming in at 2/24 before departing at 7/74. After Australia dismissed the hosts for 89 in their second innings, Australia collapsed to 3/13 in pursuit of 60 for victory. Hamence came in and scored one before he was run out after being slow to set off for a quick single; Australia collapsed to 6/31. To make matters worse, Sam Loxton was injured and could not bat, so Australia effectively <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>three</b> wickets in hand and faced their first loss to an English county since 1912. However, Australia scraped home by four wickets after a counterattack by Neil Harvey and Don Tallon, aided by a dropped catch and missed stumping.|$|E
5|$|The Buccaneers scored {{their first}} points, {{but were not}} able to score enough to win, despite {{statistically}} outperforming the Buffalo Bills in most phases of the game. The Buccaneers <b>had</b> <b>only</b> <b>three</b> Dave Green field goals to show for seven possessions inside the Bills’ 22-yard line. O.J. Simpson, who would rush for a season total of 1,503 yards, was held to only 39 yards on twenty carries. The Bills, the highest-scoring team in recent years, were 1 of 12 in third-down conversions, and were surpassed in yardage, first downs, rushing average, and number of total plays. Buffalo took the lead on Bob Chandler’s 58-yard reception of a tipped pass. The Buccaneers’ 338 yards of offense, a great improvement over their previous two games, coincided with coach McKay’s relenting to Steve Spurrier’s demands that he be able to call his own plays. Spurrier suffered a bone chip in his throwing hand that made his status questionable for the next week’s game.|$|E
