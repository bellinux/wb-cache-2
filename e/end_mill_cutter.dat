40|$|AbstractIn {{determining}} the vibrations and deflections occurring during end milling process, the modeling and structural behavior {{plays an important}} role. The geometry of an end mill tool is complex. To overcome {{the complexity of the}} analysis, a simple beam model is considered. In this work the modeling of structure of an end mill is carried out and by the application of Finite Element Methods. The Static analysis has been performed {{in order to determine the}} deflection and suppress the vibration of <b>end</b> <b>mill</b> <b>cutter</b> so that the work piece will not have waviness on the surface, leading to minimization of chatter encountered during machining. The effect of dynamic response of the end mill tool is studied with and without the application of MR damper. Metal cutting operation involves interaction of cutting forces of the tool with the regenerative forces of the material of work piece during metal cutting. To control the end mill tool vibration and suppress the chatter, the method incorporates the unique features of a magnetic-rheological fluid, utilizes the damper input current to modify the magnetic field inside the coil of the damper and increase the variable stiffness and produce damping effect. In this work, the identification of chatter is done by means of the Bingham number of the magnetic-rheological fluid. The different metal cutting parameters are considered in experimental work and results are compared with and without the application of magnetic-rheological damping effect. The results show the enhancement of quality of the machined surface, reduction of deflection of the end mill tool and decrease in the chatter marks on work piece by producing magnetic-rheological damping to the end mill tool. The experimental tests were conducted with and without the application of the magnetic-rheological damper during machining, end mill tool deflection was determined. The damper input current is varied from 0 to 2 Amps, which modifies the rheological damping effect to the end mill at different machining parameters and the results are validated with finite element analysis software ANSYS 11. 0.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{optimize}} the cutting performance of <b>end</b> <b>mills,</b> the geometry of such cutters is optimized by toolmakers constantly. As a result of geometric changes, process forces can be reduced, i. e. by serrated <b>end</b> <b>mills.</b> Tools with unequal helix angles can {{lead to an increase}} of process stability. In this paper, a method to calculate the process forces of <b>end</b> <b>mills</b> with complex geometries is presented. The method for calculating the process forces is designed for the application for stability analysis of <b>end</b> <b>mill</b> <b>cutters</b> with complex geometries. A basic introduction of the method for the stability prediction of such tools is given. Cutting forces of <b>end</b> <b>mills</b> are analyzed at incremental axial depth of cuts to show the influence of the tool geometry on the process forces. The comparison with experimental data verifies this method and shows the influence of further effects on the process forces. Furthermore, stability charts obtained with the Semi-Discretization Method are presented to show the potential of <b>end</b> <b>mills</b> with complex geometries regarding stability improvement.

40|$|This {{research}} paper presents a five step algorithm to generate tool paths for machining Free form / Irregular Contoured Surface(s) (FICS) by adopting STEP-NC (AP- 238) format. In the first step, a parametrized CAD model with FICS is created or imported in UG-NX 6. 0 CAD package. The second step recognizes the features and calculates a Closeness Index (CI) by comparing {{them with the}} B-Splines / Bezier surfaces. The third step utilizes the CI and extracts the necessary data to formulate the blending functions for identified features. In the fourth step Z-level 5 axis tool paths are generated by adopting flat and ball <b>end</b> <b>mill</b> <b>cutters.</b> Finally, in the fifth step, tool paths are integrated with STEP-NC format and validated. All these steps are discussed and explained through a validated industrial component...|$|R
