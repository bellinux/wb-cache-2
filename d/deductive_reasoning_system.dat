A two-tiered reasoning and learning architecture in which Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) is used both as a corrective of the solutions inferred by a <b>deductive</b> <b>reasoning</b> <b>system</b> and as a method for accumulating and refining knowledge is briefly described. As illustrative examples the applications of the approach for problems of the case-based maintenance of rule-based systems and for case-based refinement of neural networks are presented. Introduction It has been widely recognized in AI literatures that the main problem in applying the pure deductive reasoning for classifying natural concepts is the inadequacy of representing them by context-independent, logic-style way. The approaches to solve the problem by applying the pure abductive reasoning (e. g. CBR) are based on the exemplar view for concept representation w [...] ...|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} {{deductive}} learning is developed to control deductive inference. Our {{goal is to}} improve problem solving time by experience, when that experience monotonically adds knowledge to the knowledge base. In particular, for <b>deductive</b> <b>reasoning</b> <b>systems</b> where partial results are saved during a derivation and at least some partial results are themselves deduction rules, we suggest ways of taking maximal advantage of old partial results and avoiding the regeneration of partial results when solving new problems. We approach the problem of accumulating past deductive experience and using it in subsequent similar deductions bythescheme of knowledge migration and knowledge shadowing. Knowledge migration generates a specific rule from a general rule during a deduction, and accumulates deduction experience that {{is represented by the}} specificity relationship between the general (migrating) rule and the specific (migrated) rule. Knowledge shadowing uses deduction experience obtained in previous inferences for faster reasoning in future inference. If both general and specific knowledge are applicable in subsequent deduction, the knowledge shadowing scheme is activated to select only the specific knowledge. Three principles for knowledge shadowing are presented. A preliminary result shows that knowledge migration and shadowing greatly contribute to the system performance...|$|R

Additionally, we present a data parallel design where each learning algorithm, itself, is distributed among many processors. We exemplify these concepts of speculative and data parallel parallelism by transforming a sequential knowledge-based deduction and induction system, INDED, into a speculatively parallel system where several processors simultaneously search for an accurate rule obtained in a supervised learning environment. Moreover, a data parallel implementation of the fundamental operation of each learning algorithm, ranking, is parallelized among the cluster nodes.

40|$|International audienceOver {{the course}} of the past decade, {{contradictory}} claims have been made regarding the neural bases of <b>deductive</b> <b>reasoning.</b> Researchers have been puzzled by apparent inconsistencies in the literature. Some have even questioned the effectiveness of the methodology used to study the neural bases of <b>deductive</b> <b>reasoning.</b> However, the idea that neuroimaging findings are inconsistent is not based on any quantitative evidence. Here, we report the results of a quantitative meta-analysis of 28 neuroimaging studies of <b>deductive</b> <b>reasoning</b> published between 1997 and 2010, combining 382 participants. Consistent areas of activations across studies were identified using the multilevel kernel density analysis method. We found that results from neuroimaging studies are more consistent than what has been previously assumed. Overall, studies consistently report activations in specific regions of a left fronto-parietal system, as well as in the left BG. This brain system can be decomposed into three subsystems that are specific to particular types of deductive arguments: relational, categorical, and propositional. These dissociations explain inconstancies in the literature.

This study postulated that 141 Chico Junior High School (CJHS) seventh graders could improve their algebra scores by using <b>deductive</b> <b>reasoning</b> practices and learning mathematics deductively. Also, the study examined whether or not learning mathematics with <b>deductive</b> <b>reasoning</b> training was more effective in improving the students??? mathematics performances than without it.

40|$|Abstract. Three common {{approaches}} for deriving or predicting instantiated relations are information extraction, <b>deductive</b> <b>reasoning</b> and machine learning. Information extraction uses subsymbolic unstructured sensory information, e. g. {{in form of}} texts or images, and extracts statements using various methods ranging from simple classifiers to the most sophisticated NLP approaches. <b>Deductive</b> <b>reasoning</b> {{is based on a}} symbolic representation and derives new statements from logical axioms. Finally, machine learning can both support information extraction by deriving symbolic representations from sensory data, e. g., via classification, and can support <b>deductive</b> <b>reasoning</b> by exploiting regularities in structured data. In this paper we combine all three methods to exploit the available information in a modular way, by which we mean that each approach, i. e., information extraction, <b>deductive</b> <b>reasoning,</b> machine learning, can be optimized independently to be combined in an overall system. We validate our model using data from the YAGO 2 ontology, and from Linked Life Data and Bio 2 RDF, all of which are part of the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud. ...|$|R
