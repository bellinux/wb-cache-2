40|$|Aflatoxins B 1, B 2, G 1 and G 2, {{highly toxic}} {{mycological}} metabolic products occurring as food contaminants, were capable in minute quantities of causing delayed hypersensitivity in guinea pigs. Structurally related compounds, sterigmatocystin (a mycotoxin), coumarin, 8 -methoxypsoralen and <b>furazolium</b> <b>chloride</b> were also equally or {{more active in}} causing delayed hypersensitivity in guinea pigs. Animals which were strongly sensitized to aflatoxin B 1 showed cross-reactivity to other aflatoxins (B 2, G 1 and G 2), sterigmatocystin, coumarins, 8 -methoxypsoralen, furans and commerical perfumes. Less strongly immunized animals, on the other hand, showed differential cross-reactivity in that other aflatoxins produced frank erythema whereas closely related compounds were more moderate in action. None of these immunized animals showed any circulating antibodies...|$|E
