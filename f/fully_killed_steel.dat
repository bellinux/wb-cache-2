40|$|The dynamic {{strain aging}} (DSA) {{phenomenon}} {{is present in}} C–Mn steels and associated welds commonly used in many industrial applications. This phenomenon, which appears in metals containing solute atoms interacting with dislocations, induces an increase in flow stress and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) {{as well as a}} decrease in ductility. The DSA phenomenon was studied by tensile, strain rate sensitivity and internal friction tests between 20 uC and 350 uC in two C–Mn steels with very different sensitivities to DSA (a <b>fully</b> <b>killed</b> A 42 <b>steel</b> and a semikilled A 48 steel). The internal friction technique, which allows one to evaluate the balance between carbon and nitrogen atoms free in the lattice and carbon and nitrogen atoms interacting with mobile dislocations, appears to give results well correlated with those obtained by tensile (and strain rate sensitivity) tests. The ductility loss or the UTS increase is shown to be proportional to Snoek peak height. It is concluded that, even in industrial materials, a single internal friction test can give a good evaluation of DSA sensitivity...|$|R

Furthermore, the calculations show that Mn atoms exist as a simple solute by replacing Mg atoms in MgO, MgTi 2 O 4 and MgTiO 3.

In dry red wines with 12 % (v/v) ethanol and pH 3. 50, the inactivation depended on the initial cell concentration. For an initial inoculum of 500 CFU/ml, the MIC of the yeasts species Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Dekkera bruxellensis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia guilliermondii was 100 mg/l. The most sensitive strains belong to Zygosaccharomyces bailii, Zygoascus hellenicus and Lachancea thermotolerans, with MIC of 25 mg/l DMDC. For inoculation rates of about 106 CFU/ml, the maximum dose of DMDC legally authorised (200 mg/l) was not effective against the most resistant species.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{annealing}} cycle on the microstructure, mechanical properties and drawability of aluminium <b>killed</b> <b>steel</b> sheets at three different heating rates and different holding times were studied using tensile test, hardness test, optical microscope and {{transmission electron microscope}} techniques. The results of sample for different times in laboratory experiments were compared with production samples. The results for these experiments showed that at lower heating rates (12 °C/h) recrystallization occurred at a lower annealing temperature. This effect is attributable to the longer time available to initiate nucleation at the lowest heating rate. However, for all three heating rates (12 °C/h, 24 °C/h and 36 °C/h), the aluminium and nitrogen combine to form atmospheres or pre-precipitation clusters at polygonized subgrains and as rolled boundaries, modiflying {{the development of the}} recrystallized structure. Different amounts of AIN were precipitated prior to recrystallization for each heating rate resulting in different final recrystallized grain sizes, mechanical properties and drawabilities. The heating rate strongly influences recrystallization with a lower heating rate reducing both the temperature of the start of recrystallization and the recrystallized grain size. It is inferred that the lower rate promotes nucleation of recrystallization over growth of recrystallized. The effect of holding time on mechanical properties was to : (i) decrease tensile strength, yield strength and hardness and (ii) increase elongation and grain size. Tensile strength and hardness results from laboratory experiments were lower than those for production samples, but the trends were similar. The curve of yield strength from the production samples was however sharper than for the laboratory samples. Holding times that produced the coarsest grain size also resulted in the lowest yield strength,tensile strength and hardness...|$|R
