For Fascination, he says they put aside their individual pride to create a stronger work. The years of touring experience The Greencards have accumulated since their earliest work has helped them, as well. Referring to when they formed the band, he said, [...] "We just played in Austin. We just wrote probably anything, which was the only stuff we knew, which {{was more of a}} traditional thing.

500|$|Alan Sepinwall, on {{his blog}} What's Alan Watching, was mixed towards [...] "Of Vice and Men", writing that the episode's {{focus on the}} mystery of the week did not work thematically, as Veronica did not have a stake in its solving. [...] "The better we get to know the {{supporting}} characters and the closer each arc gets to its conclusion, the harder it gets to care about stories that don't <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> personal connection for Veronica." [...] Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, was very critical of the episode, naming five ways in which he thought Veronica was unlikable in the episode. [...] "Simply put, Veronica spends most of [...] "Of Vice and Men" [...] acting like she's better and smarter than everyone else. Of course, she is smarter than everyone, so that's okay. But better? Sometimes that's justified, sometimes it's not," [...] elaborating that Veronica became increasingly unlikeable in the episode. He was also negative towards the final sequence, writing [...] "it feels slightly manipulative," [...] commenting that the show was not ready to tackle scenes of attempted rape.|$|E

Heigl explained: [...] "They really hurt somebody, and they didn't {{seem to be taking}} a lot of responsibility for it. I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> hard time with that kind of thing. I'm maybe a little too black and white about it. I don't really know Izzie very well right now. She's changed a lot." [...] Attempting to rationalise Izzie's actions, Heigl later assessed that: People who are so infallible, perfect and moral tend {{to be the first to}} slip and fall. But I would love to see how she deals with the consequences of what she's done, because what’s interesting is when people make decisions that shake their world, they suddenly have to go, 'Woo, I didn't know I was capable of this.' I'd like to see Izzie take some culpability.|$|E
500|$|... "4 in the Morning" [...] {{was written}} by Stefani and Kanal, who was also {{responsible}} for its production, while Mark [...] "Spike" [...] Stent provided additional production. Described as a 1980s-inspired midtempo synthpop ballad, the track's instrumentation includes a [...] "light" [...] keyboard, which [...] "runs tie the song together from intro through break", a guitar, synthetic strings and a slick sheen. [...] "4 in the Morning" [...] has a midtempo beat, which according to some critics is [...] "perfect for a slow dance". Stefani's vocals throughout the song's chorus presents a [...] "fast-talking" [...] approach. Lyrically, [...] "4 in the Morning" [...] talks about transparency in a romantic relationship, with the protagonist pleading for a lover to make up his mind. Bill Lamb of About.com added that the song also deals with a relationship on the edge, which {{can be seen in}} the lines: [...] "I'm lying here in the dark, I'm watching you sleep, it hurts a lot."

500|$|Knight felt a {{parallel}} to George in that his [...] "confidence isn't always at its absolute highest", but overall he sees more differences than similarities. However, when the actor starts {{to think he}} is so different from O'Malley, an awkward move can suggest otherwise. [...] "I was walking, doing a scene with Katherine Heigl. I finished my line with her, and then I walked straight into the light stand." [...] Critical of her affair with O'Malley, Knight's co-star Heigl explained: [...] "They really hurt somebody, and they didn't {{seem to be taking}} a lot of responsibility for it. I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> hard time with that kind of thing. I'm maybe a little too black and white about it." [...] Speaking of O'Malley's relationship with Lexie, Rhimes offered her insight: [...] "I love them as friends. They make good friends. We all have that friend we met in school or the gym or somewhere – we just hit it off right away. And right away there was no pretense or airs. Just pure honesty. That's Lexie and George. They're really good friends and I can see the friendship evolving into something even greater."

500|$|The {{original}} idea {{was written by}} Jeffrey Reddick as a spec script for The X-Files {{in order to get}} a TV agent. [...] "I was actually flying home to Kentucky and I read a story about a woman who was on vacation and her mom called her and said, 'Don’t take the flight tomorrow, I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> bad feeling about it.’ She switched flights and the plane that she would have been on crashed," [...] said Reddick. [...] "I thought, that’s creepy—what if she was supposed to die on that flight?" [...] Building on his idea, Reddick wrote script and got an agent, but never submitted the script to The X-Files after a colleague at New Line Cinema suggested he write it as a feature film. [...] One of the biggest misconceptions about the project is that it was based on the real-life disaster of TWA Flight 800 that occurred in 1996. Like in the movie, the TWA disaster involved a Boeing 747 that exploded after take-off from JFK International Airport in New York en route to Paris. [...] Moreover, five chaperones and sixteen high school students from Montoursville, Pennsylvania, were aboard the doomed flight, heading to Paris with their high school French club.

I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> hard time with that kind of thing. I'm maybe a little too black and white about it. I don't really know Izzie very well right now." [...] Former The Star-Ledger columnist Alan Sepinwall expressed a negative perspective on the episode, deeming it childish and ridiculous. He disliked Rhimes' conception of the story arc involving Stevens, elaborating, [...] "If there's a doctor on this show who should be forced to repeat their intern year, if only to prevent them from being allowed to influence younger doctors, it's Izzie, not George. She proves her unfitness for this role with her first patient of the day, the deer. Not cute, not character-illuminating, just dumb." [...] Also criticized was Torres, whose regression from a [...] "cool, rocking, outgoing, cofident and full of life" [...] role was highlighted, receiving negative feedback from Sepinwall, who wrote [...] "Now the character exists entirely so the writers can dump on her, in a devolution far worse than anything. I just don't get it, and it pains me to watch any scene with Callie in it. Despite expressing a negative outlook on Meredith's story arc which dealt with Shepherd, noting that the [...] "constant break-ups and reunions are as silly as if Shonda Rhimes had just kept them apart for three seasons before letting them kiss", Sepinwall was favorable of Lexie's arrival at Seattle Grace, feeling that [...] "she's still being written as Meredith circa season one in an attempt to make us like her, but I didn't mind the manipulation, if only because there are so few characters left on this show to like." [...] The Buzzsugar television reviewer was mainly critical of the episode, describing it as a departure from [...] "the old show". However, Lexie's introduction was praised in the Buzzsugar review.|$|E
500|$|In {{spin-off}} series Torchwood (2006–2011), {{the audience}} learns that Rose's act of resurrecting Jack cursed him with {{being unable to}} die. Her absence and the Doctor's pained estrangement from her proves a point of contention for the Doctor's series 3 companion Martha (Freema Agyeman); when Martha protects the Doctor, living as a human without his memories, it is still Rose that he dreams of. When the Doctor is reunited with Donna Noble (Catherine Tate) in the show's fourth series (2008), Rose mysteriously begins {{to appear in the}} Doctor's life—first seen only by Donna, and later in silent video messages which the Doctor fails to notice. When a [...] "Time Beetle" [...] creates an alternate universe in which Donna never meets the Doctor and the Doctor dies, Rose travels from her parallel world to this world, working alongside the organisation UNIT to send Donna back in time, and make Donna's younger self turn left at a junction and not right. Rose tells Donna to say two words to The Doctor; 'Bad Wolf'. The Doctor concludes this is a sign that the Universe, and reality itself is under threat. Later, in the midst of Davros' (Julian Bleach) plot to obliterate existence, Rose unites with the Doctor and his companions Donna, Martha, Jack and Sarah Jane to make a stand against him and his army of Daleks. In the midst of the battle, a part-human Doctor is created and destroys the Daleks. The Doctor returns Rose to the parallel universe along with Jackie, and his part-human counterpart. Rose challenges the Doctor to say the words he did not say to her during their previous farewell. The Doctor does not answer, but his part-human counterpart whispers in her ear and Rose kisses him. The Doctor retreats, leaving Rose behind with his part-human counterpart. In the closing scenes of The End of Time (2010), just prior to his regeneration, the Doctor travels to Rose's housing estate in the first minutes of 2005. He speaks to her from the shadows, asking her what year it is. She tells him it is January 1, 2005. The Doctor promises her that she will <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> great year.|$|E
500|$|Debbie Chang of BuddyTV.com {{expressed}} {{disappointment in}} the shows' development throughout the season, by stating it was [...] "all about couples, jumping {{in and out}} of relationships, trying their darnedest to have hot sex on the cramped, twin-sized bunk-beds in the on-call room". Chang also noted the little screen time of characters Mark Sloan and Richard Webber, and the lack of romantic development in their storylines. Many critics negatively reviewed Izzie Stevens's development in the show's fourth season, particularly her affair with George. Katherine Heigl herself deemed their relationship [...] "a ratings ploy". Heigl explained: [...] "They really hurt somebody, and they didn’t seem to be taking a lot of responsibility for it. I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>really</b> hard time with that kind of thing. I’m maybe a little too black and white about it. I don’t really know Izzie very well right now. She’s changed a lot." [...] Laura Burrows of IGN stated the series became [...] "a little more than mediocre, but less than fantastic" [...] in its fourth season. She also said that [...] "this season proved that even strong chemistry and good acting cannot save a show that suffers from the inevitable recycled plot." [...] However, the episode [...] "Physical Attraction, Chemical Reaction" [...] received a positive review, with Burrows stating that it [...] "fully encompassed all the things that make this show great: intense emotional drama and macabre OR activities". The Derek/Rose relationship received negative reviews, with Burrows stating that it was [...] "emotional, but not remarkable". Jack Florey of IndieLondon reviewed the characters, stating that their behaviour is the show's biggest problem: [...] "the self-absorbed, pretentious and frequently selfish attitudes that drive the surgeons at the centre of Grey’s exasperate more than reward." [...] As for the storylines, Foley stated that they didn't [...] "ring true" [...] and that [...] "the plot devices became increasingly clunky", noting the lack of realism in arcs such as George and Callie's marriage and the Izzie's affair [...] "as a means of ripping it apart". Florrey also commented on Meredith Grey's arc, by stating that she turned into [...] "one of the most selfish, self-centered characters on television", whereas Mark Sloan's storyline was named [...] "sex-obsessed, borderline misogynistic and close to scandalous". Daniel Fienberg of Zap2It said [...] "One of the season's best performances came from Emmy-nominated guest star Elizabeth Reaser." [...] Pajiba TV reviewed Reaser's performance by stating that it [...] "has been one of the only good things that show's had going for it anymore." [...] Entertainment Weekly called Reaser's performance as Ava the sixth most memorable patient performance on the show.
