25|$|The extreme {{reaction}} to Mr Bigley's murder is {{fed by the}} fact that he was a Liverpudlian. Liverpool is a handsome city with a tribal sense of community. A combination of economic misfortune—its docks were, fundamentally, on the wrong side of England when Britain entered what is now the European Union—and an excessive predilection for welfarism have created a peculiar, and deeply unattractive, psyche among many Liverpudlians. They see themselves whenever possible as victims, and resent their victim status; yet at the same time they wallow in it. Part of this flawed psychological state is that they cannot accept that they might have made any contribution to their misfortunes, but seek rather to blame someone else for it, thereby deepening their sense of shared tribal grievance against the rest of society. The deaths of more than 50 Liverpool football supporters at Hillsborough in 1989 was undeniably a greater tragedy than the single death, however horrible, of Mr Bigley; but that <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> Liverpool's failure to acknowledge, even to this day, the part played in the disaster by drunken fans at the back of the crowd who mindlessly tried to fight their way into the ground that Saturday afternoon. The police became a convenient scapegoat, and the Sun newspaper a whipping-boy for daring, albeit in a tasteless fashion, to hint at the wider causes of the incident.|$|E

500|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} (AD), {{the breaking}} down of biodegradable material by microorganisms {{in the absence}} of oxygen, is recognised as an effective method of waste disposal, with the potential to address the food waste problem nationally. AD technology has a small environmental impact, producing less greenhouse gas emissions than composting. However, although the process is well established in the water industry, it is less so within the waste sector. Despite this, the AD industry is being (and planned to be further) expanded by local councils and retailers to deal with food waste; several local authorities in the UK are planning to build anaerobic digestion plants, with the largest, to be located in Selby, due to operate from 2010. Supermarket chains Tesco and Sainsbury's are both adopting AD technology to dispose of their waste, while Tesco's head of waste and recycling said: [...] "As renewable energy technologies now become mainstream, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> sending waste to landfill that could actually be put to positive use." [...] AD technology remains an experimental field though, and there is potential for advancements to increase efficiency. In July 2014 Sainsbury's began powering one of its stores using anaerobic digestion.|$|E

500|$|On June 21, Patrick Macdonald of The Seattle Times criticized Jackson, stating, [...] "He {{may have}} lived a {{sheltered}} life, but there really <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> using terms like 'Jew me' and 'kike' in a pop song, unless {{you make it}} clear you are denouncing such terms, and do so in an artful way." [...] Two days later, Jackson decided, despite the cost incurred, {{he would return to}} the studio and alter the offending wording on future copies of the album; [...] "Jew me" [...] and [...] "Kike me" [...] would be substituted with [...] "do me" [...] and [...] "strike me". The music video and some copies of the album still carry the original words, but with loud, abstract noises partially drowning them out. He reiterated his acceptance that the song was offensive to some. Spike Lee claimed {{there was some kind of}} double standard in the music industry. [...] "While the New York Times asserted the use of racial slurs in [...] "They Don't Care About Us", they were silent on other racial slurs in the album. [...] The Notorious B.I.G. says [...] "nigga" [...] on [...] "This Time Around," [...] another song on the HIStory album, but it did not attract media attention, as well as, many years before, use in lyrics of word [...] "nigger" [...] by John Lennon.|$|E
500|$|Rachel has {{had several}} romantic {{relationships}} throughout Friends decade-long run, {{the most famous}} and prominent of which remains her on-again, off-again relationship with friend Ross. Although wildly popular among audiences, the couple has been met with mixed reviews from critics. Katherine Hassel of the Daily Express described the characters' relationship as [...] "the heart of the show". China Daily cited Ross and Rachel's reunion during the series finale [...] "The Last One" [...] among the episode's highlights, while Gary Susman of Rolling Stone believes that audiences {{would not have been}} happy had the couple not ultimately reunited. Contrastingly, The Wire's Joe Reid is of the opinion that the show's second season is [...] "the only time Ross/Rachel was truly great". Virgin Media wrote that the couple's dynamics [...] "had grown mightily tedious" [...] by season ten. E! cable network ranked Rachel and Ross the ninth greatest Friends couple, writing that their relationship gave [...] "Friends fans enough iconic quotes to fill a book", considering Phoebe's line [...] "See? [...] her lobster!" [...] to be among show's most iconic. Ross and Rachel's season three breakup has spawned a debate among Friends fans, who continue to argue over which of the two was at fault: Rachel for suggesting that they take a break from their relationship, or Ross for sleeping with another woman immediately afterwards. Writing for E!, Jenna Mullins ruled in favor of Rachel, elaborating, [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> Ross sleeping with someone else after his lobster suggested taking a break", concluding that Ross [...] "blew it". The Jewish community was particularly receptive to the fact that a Jewish-American couple existed on prime time television, described by Lilith magazine as [...] "a televisual first".|$|E
2500|$|John Calvin {{describes}} the sacred {{origin of the}} role of human father (which thus demands honour). The analogy between the honour of parents and the honour of God himself is further strengthened by this understanding that earthly fatherhood is derived from God's Fatherhood. [...] Thus the duty to honour does not depend on whether the parent is particularly worthy. However, Calvin acknowledges that some fathers are outright wicked and emphasizes there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> sin in the name of honouring a parent, calling the notion [...] "absurd".|$|E

Cohn wrote it was the [...] "final dirty trick" [...] and that there had been no [...] "personal motive" [...] to their actions.

However, the constraints of an interactive medium <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> a poorly constructed story, the big {{thing is that we}} have a different medium.

Giamatti also summoned the Reds' on-air radio announcers, Marty Brennaman and Joe Nuxhall, to his office in New York City and dressed them down for inciting the fan response with [...] "inflammatory and completely irresponsible remarks" [...] - at the time, it was common for fans at ballparks to listen to their teams' radio broadcasts using portable devices.

2500|$|Finberg says [...] "I think I {{may take}} this {{opportunity}} to protest once again against the prevalent habit of calling this artist Janssens. In spite of Walpole's unfortunate remark that this is the correct form of the name, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> using it. While in England the artist invariably spelt his name Cornelius Johnson, and when he left England he changed the form to Jonson. The usual form of his signature when the name is given in full is invariably, in all the pictures painted after 1643 which I have seen : ' Cornelius Jonson van Ceulen.' He appears never to have adopted the form of Janson, Jansen, or Janssens. But so long as auctioneers are born with an ingrained conviction that a foreign-looking name gives greater value to a picture than an English name, so long may we expect to find Cornelius Johnson or Jonson masquerading in catalogues as Cornelius Janssens." ...|$|E

While {{he felt that the}} graphics were not impressive, they still looked good enough to surpass his expectations of what the game looked like. Carolyn Petit of GameSpot found that the visuals captured the look of the anime very well. She stated that the controls were complex but featured little depth. She mentioned that attacks made the battle within the game feel [...] "tremendous", but stated the Ki building process would take attention away from the combat due to being time consuming and leaving the player wide open to an attack. She also had complaints over the multiplayer, claiming that as the screen became split down the middle on offline multiplayer, it would limit the player's view and that online multiplayer was better but would be riddled with opponents that would instantly log off if things don't go their way. Jeremy Jastrzab of PAL Gaming Network pointed out that the game was good by itself, but was not as good as any of the previous games, stating that [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> it being worse than its predecessors." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the summer}} of 2000, bassist Brian Marshall began a spiral into alcoholism. While under the influence, Marshall {{threatened}} to beat up Tremonti, began missing band obligations, and attacked Stapp both verbally and online. The band {{had a meeting with}} management to discuss Marshall's future. Stapp and Tremonti supported the idea of Marshall going to rehab and attempted to talk Marshall into going, but he refused. Initially, the public thought Marshall was let go because he criticized Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder in a radio interview with KNDD in June 2000, claiming that Scott Stapp is a better songwriter, and criticized Pearl Jam's recent albums for [...] "having songs without hooks." [...] Stapp later distanced the rest of the band from Marshall's comments and stated, [...] "Yes, we get tired of the PJ question, but there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>excuse</b> <b>for</b> the arrogance and stupidity [...] I ask you all not to judge Creed as a band, because the statements made were not the band's feelings, they were Brian's. I'm sorry if Brian offended anyone, and he has already apologized for his comments." [...] Although it was reported that Marshall left Creed [...] "on friendly terms", he did not. Tremonti and Stapp were concerned for Marshall and their collective friendships, but soon after the controversy, Marshall formed a new band called Grand Luxx with his old Mattox Creed band mates. Stapp stated that Marshall's leaving was his choice and was unrelated to the Pearl Jam comments. Brett Hestla, from the band Virgos Merlot, replaced Marshall for the tour.|$|E
