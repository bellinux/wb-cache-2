50|$|Digitalis lanata {{contains}} a powerful cardiac glycoside {{that may be}} used by patients with heart conditions. Digoxin (digitalin) is a drug that is extracted from Digitalis lanata. It is used to treat some heart conditions such as atrial fibrillation. It slows atrioventricular conduction so that the heartbeat slows down and slightly increases contraction power (positive inotropic effect). Because of the improved circulation in congestive heart failure caused by fast atrial fibrillation, the kidneys can function better, which stimulates the flow of urine, which lowers the volume of the blood and lessens the load on the heart. This is the effect that was first described when the plant was discovered as a medicine (Withering 1785).Digitalin was not discovered until the mid-19th century by two French scientists Homolle Ouevenne and Theodore Ouevenne. It was not until 1875 that Oscar Schmiedberg identified digoxin in the plant. It was first isolated in the 1930s in Britain by Sydney Smith. At that time it was used to treat ulcers in the lower abdomen, boils, headaches, abscesses, and paralysis, and externally healing wounds. Today it is still extracted from the plant because synthetis is quite expensive and difficult. However, it is becoming less frequently used due to the narrow therapeutic margin and high potential for severe side effects. Digoxin is being replaced by newer drugs including beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and the calcium channel blocking agents. As new pharmacotherapeutic agents arise, the use of digitalis preparations is expected to continue to decline. There are also other commercial uses for Digitalis lanata other than heart conditions. For example, in South America the powdered leaves are used to relieve asthma, as sedatives, and as diuretics. In India it is included in an ointment that contains <b>digitalis</b> <b>glycosides</b> used to treat wounds and burns.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to advancing medical technology, Lown discovered new applications for two drugs that were widely used for cardiac problems: digitalis and lidocaine.

During a medical residency at the Montefiore Hospital in New York City, Lown demonstrated the critical role of potassium in determining the safe use of digitalis.

It also focused medical attention on potassium loss with the use of vavarious diuretics.|$|R
40|$|The {{administration}} of <b>digitalis</b> <b>glycosides</b> causes {{a variety of}} extracardiac effects. In both normal human subjects and in other species, digitalis increases smooth muscle tone of resistance and capacitance vessels. The vasoconstriction is mediated, in part, by a direct action of these glycosides on smooth muscle and, in part, {{by an increase in}} alpha-adrenergic tone. Constriction of coronary and splanchnic vessels may lead to myocardial or mesenteric ischemia. In contrast to normal subjects, patients with congestive heart failure demonstrate arteriolar and venodilation in response to these glycosides, possibly because the myocardial effect, to increase cardiac output and peripheral blood flow, overcomes the vasoconstrictor properties of these drugs. Other important actions of <b>digitalis</b> <b>glycosides</b> occur in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Their effects on the area postrema of the medulla oblongata are largely responsible for the alpha-adrenergic-mediated peripheral vasoconstriction, as well as the nausea and vomiting that frequently accompany digitalis intoxication. Actions of glycosides on the cerebral cortex are responsible for the wide range of neurotoxic effects that range from visual disturbances and headaches to seizures and coma. Finally, peripheral neurologic effects of <b>digitalis</b> <b>glycosides</b> on baroreceptor and cardiac afferent fibers may: 1) improve the depressed function of these receptors in the situation of heart failure, and 2) reflexly lower peripheral vascular resistance, thereby partially preventing the vascular constrictor action of these glycosides...|$|E

40|$|Digoxin is {{a cardiac}} {{glycoside}} isolated from plants {{of the genus}} Digitalis. The use of prepa-rations of cardiac glycoside (synonyms: digi-talis, cardiac steroids) dates back to 1785, when William Withering published his monograph “An account of the foxglove {{and some of its}} medical uses ” (Withering, 1785; Albrecht & Geiss, 2000). Isolated digoxin has been used since the early 20 th century (Cheng & Rybak, 2010). The Working Group noted that only four of the many <b>digitalis</b> <b>glycosides</b> present in the plant remain important in the marketplace. These are digoxin, digitoxin, β-acetyldigoxin and methyldigoxin (Kleemann, 2012). Furthermore, the term “digitalis use ” found in many reports probably refers not to the use of plant mate-rial, which is not commercially available as a medicinal product, but {{to the use of the}} isolated compounds. Of the four medicinally available compounds, digoxin is the most important and is exclusively available in some countries, such as the USA (see Section 1. 3). The Working Group estimated that digoxin represents at least 90 % of the world market for <b>digitalis</b> <b>glycosides.</b> While use of digitoxin worldwide is much less than that of digoxin, it may be significant in individual countries. Thus, studies reporting use of “digitalis ” should be carefully scrutinized since the agent to which people were actually exposed could have been any one of the four <b>digitalis</b> <b>glycosides.</b> The Working Group noted that most of what has been used under the term “digitalis ” in North America and Europe has been digoxin; however, there may be parts of the world where crude extract of the digitalis plant is still in use.

40|$|There {{are four}} isoforms of the α subunit (α 1 – 4) and three isoforms of the β subunit (β 1 – 3) of Na,K-ATPase, with {{distinct}} tissue-specific distribution and physiological functions. α 2 {{is thought to}} {{play a key role}} in cardiac and smooth muscle contraction and be an important target of cardiac glycosides. An α 2 -selective cardiac glycoside could provide important insights into physiological and pharmacological properties of α 2. The isoform selectivity of a large number of cardiac glycosides has been assessed utilizing α 1 β 1, α 2 β 1, and α 3 β 1 isoforms of human Na,K-ATPase expressed in Pichia pastoris and the purified detergent-soluble isoform proteins. Binding affinities of the <b>digitalis</b> <b>glycosides,</b> digoxin, β-methyl digoxin, and digitoxin show moderate but highly significant selectivity (up to 4 -fold) for α 2 /α 3 over α 1 (KD α 1 > α 2 = α 3). By contrast, ouabain shows moderate selectivity (≈ 2. 5 -fold) for α 1 over α 2 (KD α 1 ≤ α 3 < α 2). Binding affinities for the three isoforms of digoxigenin, digitoxigenin, and all other aglycones tested are indistinguishable (KD α 1 = α 3 = α 2), showing that the sugar determines isoform selectivity. Selectivity patterns for inhibition of Na,K-ATPase activity of the purified isoform proteins are consistent with binding selectivities, modified somewhat by different affinities of K+ ions for antagonizing cardiac glycoside binding on the three isoforms. The mechanistic insight on the role of the sugars is strongly supported by a recent structure of Na,K-ATPase with bound ouabain, which implies that aglycones of cardiac glycosides cannot discriminate between isoforms. In conclusion, several <b>digitalis</b> <b>glycosides,</b> but not ouabain, are moderately α 2 -selective.

40|$|The {{specific}} binding of <b>digitalis</b> <b>glycosides</b> to Na,K-ATPase {{is used as}} a {{tool for}} Na,K-ATPase quantification with high accuracy and precision. In myocardial biopsies from patients with heart failure, total Na,K-ATPase concentration is decreased by around 40 %; a correlation exists between a decrease in heart function and a decrease in Na,K-ATPase concentration. During digitalization, around 30 % of remaining pumps are occupied by digoxin. Myocardial Na,K-ATPase is also influenced by other drugs used for the treatment of heart failure. Thus, potassium loss during diuretic therapy has been found to reduce myocardial Na,K-ATPase, whereas angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may stimulate Na,K pump activity. Furthermore, hyperaldosteronism induced by heart failure has been found to decrease Na,K-ATPase activity. Accordingly, treatment with the aldosterone antagonist, spironolactone, may also influence Na,K-ATPase activity. The importance of Na,K pump modulation with heart disease, inhibition in digitalization and other effects of medication should be considered in the context of sodium, potassium and calcium regulation. It is recommended that digoxin be administered to heart failure patients who, after institution of mortality-reducing therapy, still have heart failure symptoms, and that the therapy be continued if symptoms are revealed or reduced. <b>Digitalis</b> <b>glycosides</b> are the only safe inotropic drugs for oral use that improve hemodynamics in heart failure...|$|E

The effect of P on resting heart rate (HR) and the HR response to the Valsalva's maneuver, tilt, isoproterenol (ISO), and exercise were measured. The results indicate that the resting HR and the Tachycardiac response to Valsalva and tilt cannot be used to estimate beta blockade (BB). Although P serum levels correlated well (r² = 0. 80) with the ISO dose ratio minus one, ISO challenges appear clinically inappropriate. Reduction in exercise tachycardia correlated best with P serum levels (r² = 0. 89). In patients on P therapy, in which exercise would be contraindicated, {{there appears to be no}} reliable and safe method of clinically documenting BB. Part II. The parmacokinetics of intravenous P were studied in calves before and after biochemical induction of thyrotoxicosis. The beta adrenergic response to P was measured in both euthyroid and thyrotoxic (T) animals at steady-state serum levels of P by administration of ISO. No pharmacokinetic differences were detected between animal groups; however, T calves displayed a markedly different pharmacologic response to P. On the average, 2 - 9 times higher serum levels of P were required to facilitate BB in the T calves. These results suggest that in the calf model, thyrotoxicosis induces a decreased sensitivity to P independent of laterations in P's disposition. Part III. The aim of this study was to find a <b>digitalis</b> <b>glycoside</b> (DG) with a t(½) shorter than that of digitoxin (DT), but similar to that of digoxin, and whose disposition characteristics are not influenced by alterations in renal function, as is the case with digoxin.

Decades of practical use indicate benefits in prevention and treatment of acute heart attacks. Prophylactic and therapeutic use of ouabain was recommended in insufficiencies of the left ventricle. This clinical experience disappeared in time, yet there is mounting evidence that supports a re-evaluation of ouabain in the treatment of heart disease. In 1991 ouabain was identified as an endogenous hormone. This discovery has lead to an intense re-examination of the drug, its physiological functions and its mode of action.

40|$|A {{large group}} of {{unrelated}} plants have toxic compounds that have a direct effect on the heart and blood vessels and can cause the death of animals that consume them. The most recognized of these compounds are the cardiac glycosides, of which digoxin, found in foxglove (Digitalis spp.), is best known. The toxic and pharmacologic properties of digoxin have been {{known for a long}} time. Because of its effects on the heart at therapeutic levels, it is routinely used to treat congestive heart failure in humans and animals [1]. Other cardiotoxic compounds found in plants such as yew (Taxus spp.), rhododendrons (Rhododendron spp.), laurels (Kalmia spp.), and the avocado (Persea spp.) are responsible for poisoning in animals and humans. Cardiac Glycosides Cardiac glycosides are found in 11 plant families including the Apocynaceae, Asclepiadaceae, Celastraceae, Brassicaceae, Lilaceae, Moraceae, Fabaceae, Ranunculaceae, Scrophulariaceae, Sterculiaceae, and Tiliaceae [2]. The glycosides that have specific effects on the heart are present in at least 34 genera of these plant families [2, 3]. There are 2 basic groups of glycosides in plants, cardenolides and bufadienolides, both of which have direct effects upon cardiac function. The best known cardiac glycosides (cardenolides) are digoxin and digitoxin, derived from the parent <b>glycoside</b> <b>digitalis.</b> The therapeutic value of digitalis in treating heart failure was first recognized in 1775 [4] and it is now produced commercially for therapeutic purposes from foxglove (Digitalis lannata) [5]. Immunologic methods have enabled detection of glycosid...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{considerable}} therapeutic advances, {{congestive heart}} failure (CHF) remains a medical and socioeconomic problem. CHF is usually treated with the plant-derived <b>digitalis</b> cardiac <b>glycosides</b> such as digoxin, which increase the force of contractions of failing cardiomyocytes and reduce cardiac conduction rate. However, the usage of digoxin in CHF has lessened considerably due to its narrow therapeutic window and high drug toxicity. This leads to a need for new drugs, particularly positive inotropic agents, which would not only {{improve the quality of}} life but also reduce mortality in CHF patients. So far, there has been a lack of desirable inotropic agent. With this aim in mind, an alternative drug namely 8 -(4 -methoxyphenyl) - 2, 4 -dimethyl- 9 -((4 -methylpiperidin- 1 -yl) methyl) imidazo[1, 2 -a][1, 8]naphthyridine, abbreviated as compound [1], was chemically synthesized. Previous reports indicated that compound [1] has two significant advantages for CHF treatment. Firstly, it increases muscular contraction and decreases heart rate in anaesthetized rats. The fall in heart rate is desirable in the case of CHF because it allows the heart to function more efficiently. Secondly, it has a relaxant effect on the vascular smooth muscles of the aortic ring causing a drop in the systemic blood pressure, which is an added advantage in cardiovascular treatment. However, the molecular mechanism that underlies these effects remain unclear and the toxicity of compound [1] especially its effects on the regulation of intracellular calcium concentration [Ca 2 +]i homeostasis and cell death in cultured cardiomyocytes have yet to be evaluated. Therefore, both of these aspects were investigated in this study. In addition, to discover more biologically active heterocyclic compounds, new imidazo[1, 2 -a][1, 8]naphthyridine derivative was synthesized. This compound was named GKL. The structure of GKL was identified from 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra and molecular weight was confirmed using the mass spectrum generated by LC-MS (NIST library). The potential of both compound [1] and GKL as positive inotropic agents were assessed via comparative analyses to digoxin using a standard in vitro experimental model, H 9 c 2 (2 - 1) cells, with a significant advantage of being an animal-free alternative. It was found that the mechanism of action of compound [1] and GKL might be through specific activation of L-type voltage calcium channel via G protein (β 1 -adrenoceptor) which was supported by the increased in cAMP (3 ′- 5 ′-cyclic adenosine monophosphate) concentrations. Digoxin, besides inhibiting Na+, K+-ATPase, might activate ryanodine receptors in particular to exert positive inotropic effect. Although myocardial oxygen consumptions were increased in compound [1]- and GKL-treated cells, which reduces cardiac efficiency, this consumption did not differ significantly to that of the control. As toxicity evaluation is an important step in the early stages of drug discovery, toxicity of compound [1] and GKL was examined. Compound [1] and GKL were found to induce cell death in a time-dependent manner. The cells appeared to undergo apoptotic cell death and confirmed by Western blot analysis where compound [1] and GKL regulated both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic signalling cascades. The most important finding was that GKL induced an influx of [Ca 2 +]i with reduced toxicity in mitochondria as compared to digoxin and compound [1], suggesting its potential application in targeting CHF. In summary, the positive inotropic action of compound [1] and GKL can potentially give hope to the therapeutic promise of medicine in the field of cardiovascular disease...|$|R
