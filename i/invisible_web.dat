Recently, commercial web sites have started to manually organize web-accessible databases into Yahoo!-like hierarchical classification schemes. In this paper, we introduce a method for automating this classification process by using a small number of query probes. To classify a database, our algorithm does not retrieve or inspect any documents or pages from the database, but rather just exploits the number of matches that each query probe generates at the database in question. We have conducted an extensive experimental evaluation of our technique over collections of real documents, including over one hundred web-accessible databases. Our experiments show that our system has low overhead and achieves high classification accuracy across a variety of databases. 1...|$|R

40|$|M. Sc. (Information Technology) The {{internet}} grew exponentially {{over the}} last decade. With more information available on the web, search engines, {{with the help of}} web crawlers also known as web bots, gather information on the web and indexes billions of web pages. This indexed information helps users to find relevant information on the internet. An extranet is a sub-set of the internet. This part of the web controls access for a selected audience to a specific resource and are also referred to as restricted web sites. Various industries use extranets for different purposes and store different types of information on it. Some of this information could be of a confidential nature and therefore it is important that this information is adequately secured and should not be accessible by web bots. In some cases web bots can accidently stumble onto poorly secured pages in an extranet and add the restricted web pages to their indexed search results. Search engines like Google, that are designed to filter through a large amount of data, can accidently crawl onto access restricted web pages if such pages are not secured properly. Researchers found that it is possible for web crawlers of well known search engines to access poorly secured web pages in access restricted web sites. The risk is that not all web bots have good intentions and that some have a more malicious intent. These malicious web bots search for vulnerabilities in extranets and use the vulnerabilities to access confidential information. The main objective of this dissertation is to develop a prototype web bot called Ferret that would crawl through a web site developed by a web developer(s). Ferret will try to discover and access restricted web pages that are poorly secured in the extranet and report the weaknesses. From the information and findings of this research a best practice guideline will be drafted that will help developers to ensure access restricted web pages are secured and <b>invisible</b> to <b>web</b> bots...|$|R

It is assumed that unlinked websites are less authoritative and less popular, and therefore of less quality.

If a search engine service provides instant indexing, it bypasses this quality control mechanism by not requiring incoming links. This infers that the search engine's service produces lower quality results.|$|E

In a nutshell, the <b>Invisible</b> <b>Web</b> consists of content that’s been excluded from general-purpose search engines and Web directories such as Lycos and Looksmart-and yes, even Google. There’s nothing inherently “invisible” about this content. But since this content is not easily located with the information-seeking tools used by most Web users, it’s effectively invisible because it’s so difficult to find unless you know exactly where to look. In this paper, we define the <b>Invisible</b> <b>Web</b> and delve into the reasons search engines can’t “see ” its content. We also discuss the four different “types ” of inhisibility, ranging from the “opaque ” Web which is relatively accessible to the searcher, to the truly <b>invisible</b> <b>Web,</b> which requires specialized finding aids to access effectively. The visible Web is easy to define. It’s made up of HTML Web pages that the search engines have chosen to include in their indices. It’s no more complicated than that. The <b>Invisible</b> <b>Web</b> is much harder to define and classify for several reasons. First, many <b>Invisible</b> <b>Web</b> sites are made up of straightforward Web pages that search engines could easily crawl and add to their indices but do not, simply because the engines have decided against including them.

40|$|The <b>invisible</b> <b>Web,</b> {{also known}} as the deep Web or dark matter, is an {{important}} problem for Webometrics due to difficulties of conceptualization and measurement. The <b>invisible</b> <b>Web</b> has been defined to be the part of the Web that cannot be indexed by search engines, including databases and dynamically generated pages. Some authors have recognized that this is a quite subjective concept that depends on {{the point of view of}} the observer: what is visible for one observer may be invisible for others. In the generally accepted definition of the <b>invisible</b> <b>Web,</b> only the point of view search engines has been taken into account. Search engines are considered to be the eyes of the Web, both for measuring and searching. In addition to commercial search engines, other tools have also been used for quantitative studies of the Web, such as commercial and academic crawlers. Commercial crawlers are programs developed by software companies for other purposes than Webometrics, such as Web sites management, but might also be used for crawling Web sites and reporting on their characteristics (size, hypertext structure, embedded resources, etc). Academic crawlers are programs developed by academic institutions for measuring Web sites for Webometric purposes. In this paper, Sherman and Price’s “truly invisible Web” is studied from the point of view of crawlers. The truly <b>invisible</b> <b>Web</b> consists of pages that cannot be indexed for technical reasons. Crawler parameters are significantly different to search engines, due to different design purposes resulting in different technical specifications. In addition, huge differences among crawlers on their coverage of the Web have been demonstrated in previous investigations. Both aspects are clarified though an experiment in which different Web sites, including diverse file formats and built with different types of Web programming, are analyzed, on a set date, with seven commercial crawlers (Astra SiteManager, COAST WebMaster, Microsoft Site Analyst, Microsoft Content Analyzer, WebKing, Web Trends and Xenu), and an academic crawler (SocSciBot). Each Web site had been previously copied to a hard disk, using a file-retrieving tool, in order to compare them with the data obtained by crawlers. The results are reported and analyzed in detail to produce a definition and classification of the <b>invisible</b> <b>Web</b> for commercial and academic crawlers...|$|E
