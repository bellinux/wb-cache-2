40|$|In virtual environments, {{perceived}} egocentric distances {{are consistently}} underestimated {{when compared to}} the same distance <b>judgments</b> <b>in</b> the real world. The research pre-sented in this paper explores two possible causes for the compressed distance perception in virtual environments: (1) real-time computer graphics rendering, and (2) immer-sive display technology. Our results show there is a sig-nificant difference <b>in</b> distance <b>judgments</b> between real and virtual environments. However, the differences between dis-tance <b>judgments</b> <b>in</b> virtual photographic panorama environ-ments and traditionally rendered virtual environments are small, suggesting that the display device is affecting dis-tance <b>judgments</b> <b>in</b> virtual environments. 1...|$|R

5|$|However, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) {{criticized the}} design of Grandpa Boris and charged it with being anti-Semitic. The {{controversy}} erupted when a 1998 Rugrats comic strip was published, featuring Boris in a synagogue reciting the Mourner's Kaddish. The ADL {{issued a statement saying}} that the design resembled Nazi-era depictions of Jews, {{and the fact that the}} character was reciting the sacred prayer perverted its solemnity.

In 2007, the ICTY convicted Mrkšić and Šljivančanin, but acquitted Radić. Mrkšić received a 20-year prison sentence, while Šljivančanin was sentenced {{to five years in}} prison. In 2009, Šljivančanin's sentence was increased to 17 years in prison on appeal and finally reduced to ten years following a review of the <b>judgment</b> <b>in</b> 2010.|$|E

On April 17 the plea was made public when Debora Green appeared in court to plead no contest to five charges—two counts of capital murder, one of arson, and two of attempted first-degree murder. In exchange for avoiding the death penalty, the no contest plea called for Green to accept a prison sentence of a minimum of forty years {{without the possibility of}} parole. Green denied being under the influence of any drug which would affect her <b>judgment</b> <b>in</b> making her plea or her ability to understand the proceedings in which she was participating.|$|E
5|$|Parsons was {{immediately}} fired from Hughes; the FBI investigated the complaint and were suspicious that Parsons was spying for the Israeli government. Parsons denied the allegations when interrogated; {{he insisted that}} his intentions were peaceful {{and that he had}} suffered an error of <b>judgment</b> <b>in</b> procuring the documents. Some of Parsons' scientific colleagues rallied to his defense, but the case against him worsened when the FBI investigated Rosenfeld for being linked to Soviet agents, and more accounts of his occult and sexually permissive activities at the Parsonage came to light. In October 1951 the U.S. attorney decided that because the contents of the reports did not constitute state secrets, Parsons was not guilty of espionage.|$|E

The majority's conclusion was that if the Queensland government was immune from the TPA, it would prejudice the Queensland government if the contracts and arrangements it entered were subject to the TPA through the other parties to the contracts and arrangements.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{recognition}} and enforcement of foreign <b>judgments</b> <b>in</b> China is gaining in practical significance. However, a great wall {{seems to have been}} erected against {{recognition and}} enforcement of foreign <b>judgments</b> <b>in</b> China. To make a breakthrough, the essentials for achieving {{recognition and enforcement}} of foreign <b>judgments</b> <b>in</b> China must be unveiled from a practical perspective rather than for purpose of purely theoretical analyses. Investigation into the representative cases in this regard shows that there are two requirements that are of Chinese courts first and foremost concern, namely the principle of reciprocity and the due service requirement. Special attention should be paid to both requirements informing the aforesaid cases. Satisfaction of these two requirements may well bring an anticipated recognition and enforcement of foreign <b>judgments</b> <b>in</b> China. As a necessity, applicants and foreign courts must enrich their knowledge of the Chinese law and judicial practice in this respect...|$|R
5|$|The Court of Appeal {{rejected}} {{the application of}} the subjective test in favour of the objective test on the following grounds. Firstly, the Court held that Karam Singh and other cases following it were no longer good law in so far as they applied Liversidge v. Anderson (1941) and Greene v. Secretary of State for Home Affairs (1941), which were World War II cases from the United Kingdom. The House of Lords and the Privy Council had since recognized that the majority judgments in Liversidge and Greene had been wrong, and preferred Lord Atkin's dissenting <b>judgment</b> <b>in</b> Liversidge which advocated the objective approach.|$|E

Because of the large number of plaintiffs in the case—almost 1,000—the judge appointed special masters to determine each plaintiff's right to collect damages and appropriate amount of damages; in 2007, the judge entered a default judgment against Iran for $2,656,944,877 in damages.|$|E

If the subject changes his <b>judgment</b> <b>in</b> the same direction as the evaluations of these groups of people or prestigious people, then this is considered a degree of influence that they have exerted on the participant's judgment.|$|E

5|$|Wachovia Bank also filed {{a federal}} suit in October 2007 in Atlanta seeking about $940,000 from Vick and Gerald Frank Jenkins, a {{business}} partner. The bank claimed {{the two men}} and their business, Atlantic Wine & Package LLC, defaulted on a May 2006 loan of $1.3 million {{to set up a}} wine shop and restaurant. Jenkins, a retired surgeon who owned Atlantic Wine since 2004, brought Vick in as an investor. In May 2008, the U.S. District Court in Atlanta granted a summary <b>judgment</b> <b>in</b> favor of Wachovia. The judgment of $1.11 million included the initial principal balance, interest accrued, fees, overdrawn accounts, and legal fees. The order provided that further interest could be accrued.|$|E
5|$|After filing suit, Monsanto moved for summary <b>judgment.</b> <b>In</b> response, Bowman {{argued that}} if Monsanto {{was allowed to}} {{continue}} its license past exhaustion, it {{would be able to}} dominate the market. Although the district court found Bowman's arguments compelling, it found that it was bound by previous appellate court decisions in Monsanto Co. v. Scruggs and Monsanto Co. v. McFarling to control, and in 2009, the district court ruled in favor of Monsanto. The court held that since the original farmers could not use the later generation seeds without a license, they could not make an unrestricted sale and therefore the patent rights were not exhausted. The court entered judgment for Monsanto in the amount of $84,456.30 and enjoined Bowman from making, using, selling or offering to sell any of the seeds from Monsanto's patent.|$|E
5|$|Guest came {{up against}} Sir Charles Coghlan, the senior partner of Coghlan and Welsh, {{in a case}} before the Court of the Mining Commissioner. Coghlan {{represented}} a mining company, which had pegged some gold claims on Guest's client's farm. The Commissioner gave <b>judgment</b> <b>in</b> favour of Guest, who had been instructed to oppose their registration. Following this case, although initially irritated by Guest, Coghlan invited him to join his firm in Salisbury, which Guest did in January 1912. The Salisbury office had been opened by Bernard Tancred. His passing away provided the opportunity for Guest to join the firm as a partner. For a while, the firm was known as Coghlan, Welsh, Townsend and Guest, when Townsend, one of the 1820 Settlers in the Eastern Cape, joined the firm in Salisbury. It reverted to Coghlan, Welsh and Guest, when Townsend died a little time later.|$|E
