40|$|Abstract. The {{classical}} {{mass balance}} equation is usually used {{to model the}} transfer of humidity in unsaturated macroscopically homogeneous porous media. This equation is highly non-linear due to the pressure-dependence of the hydrodynamic characteristics. The formal homogenization method by asymptotic expansions is applied to derive the upscaled form of this equation in case of large-scale heterogeneities of periodic structure. The nature of such heterogeneities may be different, resulting in locally variable hydrodynamic parameters. The effective <b>capillary</b> <b>capacity</b> and the effective hy-draulic conductivity are defined as functions of geometry and local characteristics of the porous medium. A study of a two-dimensional stone-mortar system is performed. The effect of the second medium (the mortar), on the global behavior {{of the system is}} investigated. Numerical results for the Brooks and Corey hydrodynamic model are provided.

The data were obtained in farm fields of agricultural enterprises {{in a part of}} Kromeriz district with intense agricultural production. The topsoil samples were taken in selected fields from the area of 25 m 2 in a normal crop rotation (other crop each year) in the period from March to September in 1988 - 1996. To assess physical soil properties, the samples were taken using Kopecky roller probes (from the depth of 15 to 20 cm) in three replicates The following parameters were determined: bulk density as a parameter necessary to quantify all volume characters, maximum <b>capillary</b> <b>capacity</b> as one of possible parameters of pore distribution and soil water management, and soil moisture. In samples (0 - 30 cm), humus content and quality, exchange response, cation exchange capacity, contents of exchange calcium, magnesium, potassium, and nitrate and ammonium nitrogen were determined. Regression analyses, analyses of variance, multivariete statistical methods and Statgraphics and Grapheprograms were used. An annual variation was calculated for all the studied properties using a method onon-linear regression. Our experiments show that the higher anthropogenic influence on the studied process, the longer period necessary for proving the regime. In water content, for instance, the nine-year period was sufficient. In bulk density, maximum <b>capillary</b> <b>capacity,</b> humus quality, cation exchange capacity, exchange calcium content and nitrate nitrogen content, only 50 % of cases were proved. Seasonal dynamics of exchange response, humus content and potassium content were proved at two locations and in the content of magnesium and amonnium nitrogen in one of six cases only during the nine-year period. The period could be probably shortened by higher intensity of samplings (e. g. 14 -day intervals). In this case, however, we face an economical point of view and it is not clear if longer observations are important to eliminate the effects of the year. In case the same method is used, we recommend to conduct the observations for 15 years. After further extending and completing our findings on soil regimes, it will be necessary (if we want to determine an average value) to assess correction coefficients for samplings in different time periods in order to eliminate the temporal variation. Considering the fact that the content of exchange calcium can differ by 5000 kg. ha - 1, magnesium by 130 and potassium by 1450 kg. ha - 1 during the year, these values highly surpass doses supplied with mineral fertilizers. These findings could be used particularly in precision farming.

The thermal conductivity of the grown MWCNTs calculated considering a mean layer thickness of 5 μm was 59 W/mK. The effective pore diameter of zircon ceramic wicks decreased from 0. 54 to 0. 31 μm leading to an important increase in capillary pressure.

Two lands were chosen to present minimization process at one of them and classical plowing process at the second of them. Soil pits were dug in both versions and a description of soil profiles according to the Comprehensive Survey Methodology of Agricultural Soils (NĚMEČEK 1967) was carried. Intact soil samples were taken in ten terms, four replications, from the depths (center roller) : 5 cm, 17 cm and 30 cm. Bulk samples were taken also from these depths (range 10 cm). The average volume of macroaggregates (> 0. 5 mm) was reduced during the experiment from 39, 67 % in 2012 to 33, 52 % in 2014 in a variant of plowing. The average volume in a variant of minimization changed only minimally. The volume of microaggregates in a variant of plowing incereased during the years.

30|$|In a {{monolithic}} column stationary phase contains a continuous porous material, sealed {{against the wall}} of a tube, instead of beads. Due to the decrease in chemical usage, sample usage, improved sensitivity, reusable frit-less columns and less back pressure monolithic column are very popular in the <b>field</b> of <b>capillary</b> electrochromatography (CEC). This review attempts to give an overview of three different types of monolithic columns, i.e. silica-based, polymer-based, and hybrid monolithic column. Moreover, the review also focuses on its advantages and applications over last 5  years. Relevant electronic journals such as Entrez, Science Direct, and different database, namely, PubMed, Scirus, Embase, NIH.gov, Medknow.com, Medscape.com, Scopus, Google Scholar, MedHelp.org, Cochrane Library, WebMD.com, and World Health Organization Hinari were used.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was the {{assessment}} of the influence of EM-A preparation on the properties of soil structure of medium and fine texture. Soil material for the incubation experiment was collected from humus arable horizons of four mineral soils: Gleyic Chernozem (soils A, B and D) and Haplic Fluvisol (soil C). The experiment was conducted in containers of 2000 cm 3, where soil material of about 3 kg was placed and three doses of EM-A were added. After a 12 -month incubation, aggregates of 1 cm 3 were cut out. Their basic physical properties (density, porosity) were determined, as well as the parameters which characterize the structure: dynamic and static water resistance, secondary aggregation after dynamic and static water resistance and <b>capillary</b> water <b>capacity.</b> The effect of additions of EM-A was not significant for majority of analyzed soil properties...|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} that fault rock capillary properties {{are important in}} controlling the distribution of hydrocarbons in sedimentary basins, and methods exist for predicting the <b>capillary</b> seal <b>capacity</b> of prospect bounding faults. However, fault seal capacity is rarely incorporated into models of hydrocarbon migration. This paper {{presents the results of}} migration modelling of the Oseberg Syd area of the Viking Graben incorporating fault rock <b>capillary</b> properties. Seal <b>capacity</b> is calculated in the model as a function of Shale Gouge Ratio (SGR), i. e. the percentage shale in the sequence moved past a point on a fault. Over 3 000 model realisations were run for different SGR to fault seal capacity relationships and the calculated hydrocarbon distributions were compared with known distributions. Realisations were ranked according to the closeness of fit between model and actual oil-water contacts for 7 traps. The best-fit to all 7 traps was provided by realisations with significant seal capacity at SGR values greater than ca. 0. 2; a value which is in agreement with an independently derived fault-by-fault calibration between SGR and seal capacity. The level of fill calculated for an individual trap is extremely sensitive to minor changes in the seal capacity relationship because it is controlled not only by the seal capacities of the faults that bound the trap, but also by the pattern of fill-spill of upstream traps. This sensitivity to minor changes in seal capacity introduces large uncertainties when fault seal capacity relationships are used in a predictive mode and emphasises the requirement for migration modelling in fault seal prospect evaluation...|$|R
