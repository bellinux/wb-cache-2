25|$|A garage <b>door</b> <b>opener</b> is a {{motorized}} device that opens and closes a garage door. Most {{are controlled by}} switches on the garage wall, {{as well as by}} a remote control carried in the garage owner's vehicle. In 1926, the electric garage <b>door</b> <b>opener</b> was invented by C.G. Johnson, the inventor of the garage door and founder of the Overhead Door Corporation.|$|E

25|$|Dual-way power sunroofs were {{available}} on this car. They were designed and installed by American Sunroof (now American Specialty Cars) from its Columbus, Ohio plant, not by Mopar itself. An installed sunroof eliminated {{most of the}} front overhead console that featured storage bins for a garage <b>door</b> <b>opener</b> and sunglasses. However, the Overhead Travel Information System (OTIS), or on-board computer with integrated map lights, was retained.|$|E

25|$|In electronics, {{a remote}} control is a {{component}} of an electronic device used to operate the device wirelessly from a distance. For example, in consumer electronics, {{a remote control}} {{can be used to}} operate devices such as a television set, DVD player, or other home appliance, from a short distance. A remote control is primarily a convenience feature for the user, and can allow operation of devices that are out of convenient reach for direct operation of controls. In some cases, remote controls allow a person to operate a device that they otherwise {{would not be able to}} reach, as when a garage <b>door</b> <b>opener</b> is triggered from outside or when a Digital Light Processing projector that is mounted on a high ceiling is controlled by a person from the floor level.|$|E
2500|$|A {{garage door}} {{is a large}} door on a garage that can either be opened {{manually}} or by a garage <b>door</b> <b>opener.</b> Garage doors are necessarily large to allow passage of automobiles and/or trucks.

A slight discount was available on XG300 models that deleted the automatic electronic climate control in favor for a manual three-dial system. Other options included a power moonroof on the base model, and a trunk-mounted eight-disc CD changer for the L model.|$|E
2500|$|Drivers plug {{a device}} {{the size of}} a garage <b>door</b> <b>opener</b> into the {{on-board}} diagnostic (OBD) port of their car. The device records and sends the driving data to Progressive, and Progressive uses that information to calculate the rate. After 30 days, customers find out if they’re eligible for a discount based on that 30-day [...] "snapshot" [...] of their driving habits. At the end of a six-month policy period, Progressive calculates the customer's renewal discount and customers return the device to Progressive. The company doesn’t take into account how fast the car goes although it does take into account how fast and frequently the vehicle operator brakes. Snapshot is voluntary and customers can opt out at any time. The customer is charged up to $50.00 if they do not return the snapshot device to Progressive should they decide not to engage in the program after receiving it.|$|E
