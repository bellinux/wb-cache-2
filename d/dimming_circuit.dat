40|$|This work {{discusses}} {{design and}} implementation of a switching power supply for low power cold cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFLs), used in high brightness, back-lighted, liquid crystal displays (LCDs). The power supply design is based on piezoelectric transformers. The use of piezoelectric transformers (PZTs), instead of conventional magnetic ones, allows a significant reduction of the converter's size and component count. The particular features of the piezoelectric transformer allow the designer to directly connect the lamp to the secondary side of the device {{without the need for}} the typical ballast capacitor. Besides, the start up over-voltage is automatically generated with no need for input voltage amplitude or frequency modulation. On the other hand, the peculiar PZT secondary side arrangement and its high voltage, low current operation, call for particular care in the implementation of the LCD <b>dimming</b> <b>circuit.</b> The paper describes the different power supply components, particularly focusing on the PZT characteristics, outlines the design procedure for the output stage of the power supply (i. e. a resonant half-bridge inverter) and discusses the LCD brightness control strategy.

RysBefore year 2012 the US States must {{implement}} {{and continue}} using an assessment or management method to maintain traffic signs’ retro-reflectivity {{at or above}} the minimum levels adopted by FHWA. Overhead guide signs are a particular problem because past research has shown that with available sheeting types, external illumination may still be necessary. Newer sheeting types and more energy efficient and cost-effective lighting systems are currently available. Over the next several years there is potential for savings {{of tens of thousands of}} dollars if the states don’t have to use external illumination for their overhead guide signs, or, if more energy efficient, low cost lighting systems are used when necessary. A detailed literature review was conducted on minimum retro-reflectivity values for overhead guide signs, the legibility distance under reduced sign luminance and the lighting systems available for external illumination. There is no agreement found in the previous research studies as to what is the optimum or minimum luminance of the guide signs. In addition, a survey was sent to all state DOTs. This survey was focused on finding states’ policies regarding the use of sheeting type and external illumination requirement, and methods and lighting systems for maintaining minimum values for overhead guide sign luminance. The total response rate was 56 % (28 out of 50 state DOTs responded). Out of 28 respondents 19 said that they have usage policy for the type of sheeting material used for overhead guide signs and 18 of them provided details about their policy.

40|$|Domestic {{fans are}} a widely used {{appliance}} {{all around the}} world. There are several types of fan controllers available for the speed controlling of the fans. Since the cost is a dominant factor when the relevant market is concerned, low cost fan controllers are popular among them {{even though there are}} several drawbacks. This thesis discusses design and implementation of a utility friendly hum less remote control fan controller unit at an affordable price. Electronic fan controllers are used due to the compact design and the low cost. It allows speed reduction through out the range. Most of the available fan controllers use voltage controlling while keeping the frequency constant to control the speed. The mostly available <b>dimmer</b> <b>circuits</b> consist of Triacs as the switching device. Wave form is chopped by an electronic circuit to reduce the line voltage. This generates low order harmonics which affect the utility power while making irritating noise especially at low speeds. The proposed system designed with a power circuit with power IGBTs as the switching device which uses microprocessor based control system as the signal generator. The algorithm is developed under Harmonic Elimination PWM scheme which switches the power circuit in firing angles which avoids low order harmonics at the predefined speed levels. The designed system fire the power IGBTs at pre defined firing angles at selected speed levels. It avoids the 3 r d 5 t h and 7 t h order harmonics below 80 % of the line voltage at the operation while avoiding 3 r d and 5 t h above 80 % of the line voltage.

25|$|In many cases, a dimmer can be {{replaced}} by a constant power module (CPM), which is typically a 20- or 50-ampere breaker in a dimming module casing. CPMs are used to supply line voltage to non-dimming electrical devices such as smoke machines, chain winches, and scenic motors that require constant operating voltage. When a device is powered by a CPM, it is fully energized whenever the CPM is turned on, independent of lighting console levels. CPMs must be used (in lieu of dimmers) to power non-dimming devices that require specific line voltages (e.g., in the US, 110 V, 60Hz power) in order to avoid damage to such devices. Dimmers are seldom used to control non-dimming devices because even if a dimmer channel is trusted to always operate at full power, it may not be controlled when communications are disrupted by start up and shut down of the lighting control surface, noise interference, or DMX disconnects or failure. Such a loss of control might cause a dimmer to <b>dim</b> a <b>circuit</b> and thus potentially damage its non-dimming device.|$|R
