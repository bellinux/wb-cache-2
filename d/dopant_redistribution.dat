40|$|The {{effect of}} scaling down the channel width on the {{threshold}} voltage of deep submicron MOSFETs with LOCOS isolation has been investigated. Previous results, obtained from 1 mu m technology and above, show an increase in threshold voltage as the width is reduced. However, in deep submicron technology, oxide thickness is scaled-down and channel doping is increased to avoid punchthrough and maintain a sufficiently high threshold voltage. This results in a threshold voltage reduction as channel width is scaled-down-the so called Inverse-Narrow-Width-Effect (INWE). The trend is explained through <b>dopant</b> <b>redistribution</b> and is verified by both experiment and process simulation.

Shallow junctions (depth x(j) 3 x 10 (20) cm- 3 for As; (C(int) > 8 x 10 (19) cm- 3 for B) were obtained with RTP. For FA above 800 -degrees-C, the diffusion of B from CoSi 2 into Si results in a drop of C(int) < 2 x 10 (19) cm- 3 because of strong B segregation and probably reactive loss at the SiO 2 /CoSi 2 interface.

Initial results show an implant temperature dependence of the damage structure and arsenic lattice position prior to anneal.

40|$|Experimental {{observations}} of dopant diffusion and defect formation are reported vs ion energy and implant temperature in Si-implanted GaAs. In higher energy implants (> 100 keV), {{little or no}} diffusion occurs, while at energies less than 100 keV, the amount of <b>dopant</b> <b>redistribution</b> is inversely proportional to energy. Extended defect density shows the opposite trend, increasing with ion energy. Similarly, Si diffusion during post implant annealing decreases {{by a factor of}} 2. 5 as the implant temperature increases from - 2 to 40 C. In this same temperature range, maximum depth and density of extrinsic dislocation loops increases by factors of 3 and 4, respectively. Rutherford backscattering channeling indicates that Si- implanted GaAs undergoes an amorphous-to-crystalline transition at Si implant temperatures between - 51 and 40 C. A unified explanation of the effects of ion energy and implant temperature on both diffusion and dislocation formation is proposed based on known differences in sputter yields between low and high energy ions and crystalline and amorphous semiconductors. The model assumes that the sputter yield is enhanced at low implant energies and by amorphization, thus increasing the excess vacancy concentration. Estimates of excess vacancy concentration are obtained by simulations of the diffusion profiles and are quantitatively consistent with a realistic sputter yield enhancement.

40|$|The {{continuous}} miniaturization of metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFET) experiences increasing {{difficulties with}} {{the formation of}} source and drain contacts by ion implantation. Hence, a new MOSFET architecture based on metallic contacts over silicon was proposed to replace conventional highly doped source and drain extensions. To realize such a device, the so-called Schottky barrier (SB) MOSFET, requires materials presenting low Schottky barrier heights (SBH) to silicon. For n-type SBMOSFETs, the best candidates are rare-earth silicides, alloys between silicon and a rare-earth metal. However, the intrinsic SBH of rare-earth silicides is still too high for SBMOSFETs to compete in performance with conventional devices. The SBH can be decreased by dopant segregation, where a thin dopant layer is interposed between the silicide and silicon. First, the reaction between n-type silicon and a rare-earth metal, erbium, was investigated under various processing conditions. A SBH of 0. 3 eV, comparable to the state of the art, was determined regardless of the fabrication method. The SBH was observed to drop with increasing growth temperature, in correlation with the progressive crystallization of erbium silicide. Next, the achievement of a very low effective SBH of about 0. 1 eV together with the <b>dopant</b> <b>redistribution</b> in the silicide testify to efficient dopant segregation, therefore paving the way towards next generation silicon-based nanodevices.

Dilatometry was used to track the thermal expansion of the CeO 2 nanoparticles as well as the reduction of segregated copper oxide into metallic copper when exposed to reducing conditions. The electrical properties of the nanoparticle array, extracted from impedance spectroscopy studies, point to proton conduction at low temperatures, with a transition to n-type electronic conductivity of CeO 2 at higher temperatures. After segregation of percolating interfacial layers, induced by exposure to reducing atmosphere, the electrical properties become dominated by p-type Cu 2 O at intermediate pO(2) and metallic copper at low pO(2).

40|$|The damage {{evolution}} and concomitant <b>dopant</b> <b>redistribution</b> {{as a function}} of ion fluence during ultra shallow, heavy ion implants into Si have been investigated using medium energy ion scattering (MEIS) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). These studies involved As and Sb ions implanted at room temperature, at energies of 2. 5 and 2 keV to doses from 3 × 1013 to 5 × 1015 cm− 2. MEIS is capable of detecting both the displaced atom and implant profiles with sub-nanometre depth resolution. These studies show that for doses up to 1 × 1014 cm− 2 (at which an amorphous layer is formed) the damage build up does not follow the energy deposition function. Instead it proceeds through the initial formation of a ∼ 4 nm wide amorphous layer immediately under the oxide, that grows inwards into the bulk with increasing dose. This behaviour is explained in terms of the migration of some of the interstitials produced {{along the length of the}} collision cascade to the oxide or amorphous/crystal Si interface, where their trapping nucleates the growth of a shallow amorphous layer and the subsequent planar growth inwards of the damage layer. Although for doses ⩾ 4 × 1014 cm− 2 the As depth profiles agreed well with TRIM calculations, for lower doses As was observed to have a shallower profile, ∼ 2 nm nearer to the surface. This behaviour is related the growth of the amorphous layer and ascribed to the movement of As into the near-surface amorphous layer (probably mediated by point defect migration) in which the larger dopant is accommodated more easily.

40|$|As {{junction}} depths {{in advanced}} semiconductor devices move to below 20 nm, {{the process of}} disorder evolution during ion implantation at ultra low energies becomes increasingly influenced by the surface. This may also hold for shallow regrowth and <b>dopant</b> <b>redistribution</b> processes during subsequent thermal annealing of the substrate. The investigation of these near-surface processes requires analytical techniques with a depth resolution of≤ 1 nm. Medium energy ion scattering (MEIS) has the unique capability of simultaneously providing quantitative, high-resolution depth distributions of implant disorder (displaced Si lattice atoms) and of implanted atoms, albeit not of light species. We report here a comparative MEIS investigation into the growth mode of shallow disordered/amorphised layers during≤ 1 keV B+ and 2. 5 keV As+ ion implantation into Si. In both cases {{the growth of the}} damage depth profiles differs significantly from the energy deposition function, as it is strongly determined on the one hand by the proximity of the surface acting as a nucleation site for migrating point defects formed during implantation, which results in planar growth of the amorphous layer, and on the other by the dynamic annealing processes operating at room temperature. When such defect recombination processes are inhibited, e. g. for low dose, ultra shallow 200 eV B+ implants, MEIS shows that defect production yields exceeding the Kinchin–Pease model predictions are achieved. For As implants, a correlation is observed between the movement of the As and the depth of the growing, planar amorphous layer. Thermal annealing of As implanted samples at different temperatures and durations leads to solid phase epitaxial regrowth. During regrowth, MEIS shows that there is a close correlation between damage dissolution, the movement of nearly half of the As dopant into substitutional sites and the snowploughing of a fraction of the As in front of the advancing amorphous/crystalline interface leading to the formation of a less than 1 nm wide As pile-up layer trapped under the oxid...|$|E
40|$|The work {{described}} in this thesis concerns studies of damage and annealing processes in ion implanted Si, relevant {{for the formation of}} source / drain extensions in sub 100 nm CMOS devices. Implants were carried out using 1 - 3 keV As, BF 2 and Sb ions and implanted samples were annealed at temperatures between 550 °C and 1130 °C. The principal analysis technique used was Medium energy ion scattering (MEIS), which yields quantitative depth profiles of displaced Si atoms and implanted dopants. The results obtained have been related to comparative analyses using SIMS, TEM and X-ray techniques. Heavy ion damage evolution and the concomitant <b>dopant</b> <b>redistribution</b> as a function of ion dose was investigated using As and Sb implantation into Si. It was found that for low doses the damage build up does not follow the energy deposition function. Instead a ~ 4 nm wide amorphous layer is formed initially under the oxide that grows inwards into the bulk with increasing dose. For low doses As is seen to have migrated into the damaged regions near the surface, where it appears to be more readily accommodated. Both effects are ascribed to the migration of interstitials. Various annealing studies have been carried out to investigate the regrowth behaviour of the damaged Si and the redistribution of the dopant. Effects of recrystallisation, dopant movement into substitutional positions, dopant segregation and diffusion are observed. Annealing studies of implanted Silicon on Insulator (SOI) wafers have shown a regrowth that has a wavy a/c interface unlike the layer by layer mode that is typical in solid phase epitaxial regrowth. This effect is ascribed to localised damage accumulation at the buried oxide layer. Following a BF 2 implant into Si, pre-amorphised by a Xe bombardment, an interaction between Xe, F and B has been observed to occur upon annealing during which the implanted species conglomerate at depths related to the end of range of the BF 2 implant in the amorphous Si.

40|$|Thermo-electricity {{offers an}} elegant {{solution}} to the problem of heat-to-electricity conversion. As a completely solid-state heat engine, thermoelectric materials confer many advantages in electricity generation and heat pumping. However, the efficiency of thermoelectric material, represented by the figure of merit, Z, is generally low. In order to increase Z, it is desirable to increase a property of material known as the density of states (DOS). In this work, two approaches to increase DOS were explored, one based on the physical effect of quantum confinement in Si nanowires, and another based on the chemical approach where by GaAs property are drastically changed by doping of N. While the Si nanowires fabrication have proved to be extremely challenging, and results were hard to obtain, some xvii interesting insight into <b>dopant</b> <b>redistribution</b> in nanowires were observed. For the GaNAs, the research goal was completed, and the hypothesized enhancement in effective mass was observed. Although the power factor enhancement was not obtained, the work shows that resonant doping could be potentially useful, provided that problem with significant alloy scattering can be overcome. In Chapter 1, a thorough explanation of the theory behind thermoelectric property of materials is given. The discussion will go through the mathematical rigor behind the derivation of n, [mu] S, and Ke. In Chapter 2, the theoretical basis of this work is established. The optimal reduced Fermi level is identified, and its utility is discussed in relation to the identification of the maximum power factor. The two approaches to increasing density of states are discussed. In Chapter 3, the transport coefficient measurement system that was built for this work is described.

Predicted increase in effective mass was observed, but N scattering prevents the realization of a power factor enhancemen...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{demonstrates}} the {{effective use of}} low temperature molecular beam epitaxy to encapsulate planar Si:P (phosphorus-in-silicon) devices lithographically patterned by scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) without significant redistribution of the dopants. To achieve this goal, low temperature magnetotransport is used in combination with STM, Auger electron spectroscopy and secondary ion-mass spectrometry to analyse Si:P &# 948;-doped samples fabricated under different doping and growth conditions. An important aspect of this project {{is the use of}} large 1 × 1 cm 2 Si(001) samples which are about five times larger than standard STM samples. The larger sample size is necessary for post-STM fabrication lithography processes in a cleanroom but presents problems for preparing atomically clean surfaces. The ability to prepare clean and atomically flat Si(001) surfaces for STM lithography on such 1 × 1 cm 2 samples is demonstrated, and it is shown that Si:P &# 948;-doped layers fabricated on these surfaces exhibit complete electrical activation. Two dopant sources (gaseous PH 3 and solid GaP source) were investigated to assess their compatibility with STM-lithography on the H:Si(001) surface. The findings show that while the PH 3 and GaP sources result in near identical electrical qualities, only PH 3 molecules are compatible with H-resist based lithography for controlled nano-scale doping. For achieving complete activation of the P dopants, it is shown that an anneal to &# 8764; 350 &# 9702;C to incorporate P atoms into the Si surface prior to encapsulation is critical. While it is known that the presence of H during growth degrades the quality of Si epitaxy, investigations in this thesis indicate that it has no significant effect on dopant activation. Systematic studies performed {{to assess the impact of}} growth temperature recommend an encapsulation temperature of 250 &# 9702;C for achieving optimal electrical qualities with minimal dopant segregation. In addition, it is shown that rapid thermal anneals (RTAs) at temperatures 700 &# 9702;C should be avoided due to the high probability of <b>dopant</b> <b>redistribution.</b> To elucidate the nature of 2 D transport in Si:P &# 948;-doped devices, a detailed analysis of the low temperature magnetotransport for Si:P &# 948;-doped layers with doping densities in the range &# 8764; 0. 2 &# 8722; 2 × 1014 cm&# 8722; 2 was carried out. Using conventional 2 D theories for disordered systems, both weak localisation (WL) and electron-electron interactions (EEI) are shown to contribute almost equal corrections to the 2 D conductivity. In particular, it is found that EEI can introduce a significant correction in the Hall coefficient RH (hence Hall density) especially in the low density/temperature regime and the need to correct for this when using the Hall density to estimate the activated electron density is highlighted. While the electronic mean free path in such highly doped &# 948;-layers is typically < 10 nm making ballistic transport in these devices difficult to observe, the phase coherence length can extend to almost 200 nm at about 0. 3  0. 5 K for doping densities of &# 8764; 1 &# 8722; 2 × 1014 cm&# 8722; 2. Finally, the optimised encapsulation strategy developed in this thesis is applied to a 2 D square device fabricated by STM. The device exhibits Ohmic conductivity with complete dopant activation. An analysis of its low temperature magnetotransport shows that the device behaves similarly to a Si:P &# 948;-doped layer encapsulated under similar conditions, thus highlighting that the STM patterning process had no adverse effect on device quality...|$|E
40|$|As device sizes {{continue}} to shrink, increasing the dopant activation even beyond solid solubility while simultaneously decreasing the junction depth {{is becoming increasingly}} difficult. Equally important are interactions between the junction and the silicide to form low-resistive contacts. Due to the enormous costs and loss of time, technological verification is only possible for the most promising device designs with TCAD expected to save 40 % of the development costs. This requires combined efforts from the development of alternative approaches {{for the formation of}} ultrashallow junctions, the understanding and modeling of the physical phenomena governing the respective processes, the development of measurement techniques to characterize such junctions, and finally the formation and electric evaluation of new silicide approaches. Technological concepts to achieve metastable dopant concentrations in association with ultrashallow junctions may include laser melting and recrystallization, flash annealing, gas-phase doping through epitaxial processes, and solid-phase epitaxial regrowth from amorphous layers. In addition, dopant-additives like germanium, carbon, or fluorine are expected to be used in an effort to lower junction depths and resistance of contact regions. In typical processing, thermal cycles are still required after these steps, so a key concern is the subsequent thermal stability of the layers. To addr ess all these issues, a symposium on Silicon Front-End Junction FormationPhysics and Technology was organized and held from April 13 to 15, 2004, as part of the 2004 MRS Spring Meeting in San Francisco. This volume contains the proceedings of that symposium. The symposium continues a series of symposia on the physics and technology of silicon front-end processing and of ultra-shallow junction engineering with the aim to bring together materials scientists, silicon technologists, and TCAD researchers to share experimental results and physical models. The symposium was organized into nine oral and two poster sessions. A variety o f invited (A. Agarwal of Axcelis, J. Gelpey of Vortek, A. Jain of Texas Instruments, and W. J. Taylor of Motorola) and contributed presentations highlighted the trends in research on the formation of ultra-shallow junctions and their integration into devices. It was generally agreed that conventional RTP processes {{will not be able to}} reach the 45 nm node of the ITRS. As alternatives, concepts based on solid-phase epitaxy or millisecond-flash annealing and the use of impurities like fluorine or carbon were discussed. An important issue for future devices are silicides and germanides which were discussed by J. A. Kittl of IMEC in an invited presentation and by a variety of contributed ones. Due to the trend to lower process temperatures, the scientific and technological interest was directed especially towards nickel silicides. Of similar importance for future technologies is the usage of silicon-germanium layers in which, as shown by N. E. B. Cowern of the University of Surrey in his invited presentation during a joint session with Symposium B, <b>dopant</b> <b>redistribution</b> is considerably affected by strain effects. Process development and optimization nowadays is hardly conceivable without technology computer aided design (TCAD). In an invited contribution, M. Law of the University of Florida discussed the potentials and limitations of process simulation. Other invited presentations by B. Colombeau of the University of Surrey and M. Hane of NEC as well as various contributed presentations covered applications from atomistic modeling to the prediction of ultra-shallow junction formation. The symposium was concluded by presentations of applications of state-of- the-art characterization methods, commenced by an invited presentation of W. Van dervorst of IMEC who demonstrated two-dimensional carrier profiling on the nm scale. We would like to thank all of the invited speakers, contributors and chairpersons, as well the symposium audience for their lively contributions to the symposium. We are also grateful to the reviewers of the papers in this volume for giving considerable thought and effort to their tasks and for improving the quality of these proceedings. Financial support for this symposium was provided by ASM International, Axcelis Technologies, Philips Semiconductors Crolles, Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates Europe BV, and Vortek Industries Ltd. even in hard economic times. Finally, we wish to thank the MRS Headquarters staff for its outstanding assistance in organizing the meeting and publishing these proceedings...|$|E
