The electrical properties of these conductive zones characterize an elevated fluid content that is compatible with a weak crust, which may permit flow of crustal materials in the <b>collision</b> <b>zone.</b> The corresponding conductive zones have been previously identified further west of the <b>collision</b> <b>zone,</b> and in this study, it is shown that they extended horizontally to the east, which implies that the electrical characteristic of the <b>collision</b> <b>zone</b> is continuous from west to east beneath the Anatolian Plateau and may imply the existence of two localized crustal flow channels situated laterally parallel to the orogen. The roughly north–south compressional tectonics in the <b>collision</b> <b>zone</b> lead to the generation of north–south-trending tensional cracks perpendicular to the east–west-trending extension, which also supports the argument for east–west-directed localized mid-to-lower crustal flow.|$|R

30|$|The northeastern Turkey {{is located}} at the {{intensely}} deformed east Anatolian <b>Collision</b> <b>Zone</b> that is formed by the collision of the Arabian Plate with Eurasia. The region {{is one of the best}} examples of the continental <b>collision</b> <b>zone</b> in the world and exhibits an active north–south shortening and a young and widespread volcanism. In northeastern Anatolia, the ongoing motions of the Arabian and Eurasian Plates through a range of deformation processes have generated the Erzurum–Kars Plateau, a region of large-scale deformation and uplift observed at surface. However, the nature of deformation driven by the continental collision remains unresolved at depth. In this study, magnetotelluric (MT) data recorded at 74 sites constituting two intersecting profiles have been used to construct the characteristic electrical conductivity pattern associated with the intensely deformed east Anatolian <b>Collision</b> <b>Zone</b> beneath the Erzurum–Kars Plateau, northeastern Turkey, with the aim of imaging the 3 D distribution of fluids in order to link it with subsurface rheological conditions. An equal number of colocated transient electromagnetic (TEM) sounding data were used to allow the static shift correction of the MT data; a borehole was also drilled inside the study area. We ran a one-dimensional inversion of TEM data in order to determine shift in MT data and a three-dimensional inversion using full components of MT impedance tensor previously corrected for static shift. The resulting models showed that two distinct conductive zones probably indicating local accumulation of melt exist at mid-to-lower crustal depths (15 – 45  km) throughout the Erzurum–Kars Plateau. The spatial distribution of these anomalously conductive zones mechanically characterizes weak areas that may permit flow of crustal materials in the <b>collision</b> <b>zone.</b> These conductive zones have been previously identified further west of the <b>collision</b> <b>zone,</b> which implies that the electrical characteristic of the <b>collision</b> <b>zone</b> is continuous from west to east beneath the Anatolian Plateau. The spatial extent of the conductive zones may suggest the presence of two localized crustal flow channels situated laterally parallel to the orogeny. These findings can potentially contribute to understanding of the crustal structure of <b>collision</b> <b>zones,</b> in particular east Anatolian <b>Collision</b> <b>Zone,</b> and the hypothesis that crustal flow can occur in orogenic belts.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{conclusions}} of most previous {{studies on the}} eastward extension of the <b>collision</b> <b>zone</b> between the Sino-Korean and Yangtze Blocks can generally {{be divided into two}} categories: (1) the <b>collision</b> <b>zone</b> is connected to the Imjingang belt and crosses the Korean Peninsula; (2) the eastward extension of the <b>collision</b> <b>zone</b> does not enter the Korean Peninsula, nor is connected to the Imjingang belt. Recent geophysical studies on gravity and velocity tomography in the Yellow Sea and adjacent regions, respectively, have provided geophysical evidence for a nearly north– south-trading dextral strike-slip fault in the eastern margin of the Yellow Sea, which we have named the East Marginal Fault of the Yellow Sea (EMFYS). The geophysical evidence indicates that the EMFYS extends to great depth. It dips westward, and within 100 km depth the dip angle is very steep. The geophysical characteristics on its two sides show that they belong to different tec-tonic units. This fault is connected to the Wulian–Qingdao Fault in the north, and to the South Marginal Fault of Jeju Island (SMFJI) in the south (the SMFJI {{is a part of the}} <b>collision</b> <b>zone).</b> Therefore the EMFYS is considered as a part of the junction zone between the Sino-Korea and Yangtze Blocks, with the Korean Peninsula being part of the Sino-Korea Block.

40|$|In Japanese islands, {{there exist}} two ongoing arc-arc <b>collision</b> <b>zones</b> (Hidaka region in Hokkaido and Izu region in Honshu). This paper {{presents}} an overview for recent geophysical and geological researches on the arc-arc collisions. In the Hidaka <b>collision</b> <b>zone,</b> the Kuril forearc has been collided onto the Northeast Japan arc since Miocene. A series of intensive seismic reflection and refraction since 1994 provided clear {{images on the}} collision style including the crustal delamination of the Kuril forearc in this region. These results constrain an important process {{for the formation of}} continental crust. Namely, delaminated lower (more mafic) crust of the Kuril forearc is descending down, and being transferred into the mantle by the plate subduction. The resultant crust becomes more felsic, which probably will be a core of the continental crust. The deep structure and deformation style of the Izu <b>collision</b> <b>zone,</b> where the Izu-Bonin arc is colliding to Honshu Island, has not been clarified as yet. In this paper, some of the recent geological and geophysical studies in these regions are introduced...|$|R
30|$|Non-volcanic tremors {{triggered}} by surface waves from teleseismic events {{have been detected}} all over the world. Most studies have investigated tremors that were located near or on plate boundaries such as subduction zones (Miyazawa and Brodsky 2008; Rubinstein et al. 2009; Yabe and Ide 2013), transform boundary zones (Peng et al. 2009), and <b>collision</b> <b>zones</b> (Chao et al. 2012). However, non-volcanic tremors are rarely detected away from plate boundaries.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of a {{systematic}} geochemical study of intermediate and acid intrusive rocks from a number of continent-continent <b>collision</b> <b>zones</b> of Phanerozoic age. Four groups of intrusions can be recognized, each associated with a particular stage in the tectonic evolution of a <b>collision</b> <b>zone.</b> Pre-collision calc-alkaline (volcanic-arc) intrusions which are mostly derived from mantle modified by a subduction component and which are characterized by selective enrichments in LIL elements. Syn-collision peraluminous intrusions (leucogranites) which may be derived from the hydrated bases of continental thrust sheets and which are characterized by high Rb/Zr and Ta/Nb and low K/Rb ratios. Late or post-collision calc-alkaline intrusions which may be derived from a mantle source but undergo extensive crustal contamination and can only be distinguished from volcanic-arc intrusions by their higher ratios of Ta/Hf and Ta/Zr. Post-collision alkaline intrusions which may be derived from mantle lithosphere beneath the <b>collision</b> <b>zones</b> and which carry high concentrations of both LIL and HFS elements. The geochemical evolution of crustal melts within groups (ii) and (iii) can be viewed in terms of the dehydration reactions, volatile transfer and transient geothermal gradients that result from thrust tectonics in the <b>zone</b> of <b>collision...</b>|$|R

40|$|The upper-mantle {{structure}} {{across the}} Zagros <b>collision</b> <b>zone,</b> in southwest Iran, is investigated using a non-linear weighted damped least-squares teleseismic tomography approach. The {{resolution of the}} structures/transitions in the upper mantle is enhanced significantly by correcting the teleseismic relative arrival time residuals for an a priori crustal velocity model and then performing the inversion with fixed crustal blocks. To investigate {{whether or not the}} lithospheric blocks and major transitions in the resulting model are required by the data or are artefacts of the inversion, the data were inverted using two different inverse methods (singular value decomposition and a quadratic programming method). New high-quality seismic velocity models show apparent correlation between surface geological features and seismic velocity structures at lithospheric depth across the Zagros <b>collision</b> <b>zone.</b> The image shows a sharp lithospheric boundary at the Main Zagros Thrust between 100 km and 250 km depth with P-wave velocity about 3 per cent faster within the Arabian Shield to the south.

40|$|The Hidaka <b>collision</b> <b>zone,</b> {{where the}} Kurile and northeastern (NE) Japan arcs collide, {{provides}} a useful study area for elucidating the processes of arc-continent evolution and inland earthquakes. To produce {{an image of the}} collision structure and elucidate the mechanisms of anomalously deep inland earthquakes such as the 1970 Hidaka earthquake (M 6. 7), we conducted magnetotelluric observations and generated a three-dimensional resistivity distribution {{in the southern part of}} the Hidaka <b>collision</b> <b>zone.</b> The modeled resistivity was characterized by a high resistivity area in the upper crust of the Kurile arc corresponding to metamorphic rocks.

The resulting database is then integrated with the data presented by Okay et al. (2010) for the Bitlis Pütürge Massif, i. e. the western portion of the Bitlis-Zagros <b>collision</b> <b>zone</b> between Arabia and Eurasia. The mid-Miocene exhumation episode along the Black Sea coast and Lesser Caucasus of Armenia documented in this dissertation mirrors the age of collision between the Eurasian and Arabian plates along the Bitlis suture zone. We argue that tectonic stresses generated along the Bitlis <b>collision</b> <b>zone</b> were transmitted northward across eastern Anatolia and focused (i) at the rheological boundary between the Anatolian continental lithosphere and the (quasi) oceanic lithosphere of the Black Sea, and (ii) along major pre-existing discontinuities like the Sevan-Akera suture zone. The integration of both present-day crustal dynamics (GPS-derived kinematics and distribution of seismicity) and thermochronological data presented in this paper provides a comparison between short- and long-term deformation patterns for the entire eastern Anatolia-Transcaucasian region. Two successive stages of Neogene deformation of the northern foreland of the Arabia-Eurasia <b>collision</b> <b>zone</b> can be inferred. (i) Early and Middle Miocene: continental deformation was concentrated along the Arabia-Eurasia (Bitlis) <b>collision</b> <b>zone</b> but tectonic stress was also transferred northward across eastern Anatolia, focusing along the eastern Black Sea continent-ocean rheological transition and along major pre-existing structural discontinuities.
