25|$|On {{the basis}} of this {{information}} Scipio elaborated his plan for the battle. He knew that the Carthaginian preparations to attack Castra Cornelia were continuing, and with the first signs of the spring he launched a preemptive strike. The ancient authors provide two versions of what happened. According to Livy and Polybius, Scipio placed a detachment (2,000 strong) on a hill overlooking Utica so as to deceive the enemy’s scouts that he was preparing to attack the city. Another small detachment was left to guard the Roman camp against possible attack from the city’s defenders. The main forces marched at night, more than 10 kilometers, and reached the camps of Hasdrubal and Syphax before dawn. Scipio separated the army in two halves and ordered Laelius and Massinissa’s Numidians to set fire and destroy the camp of Syphax. Laelius and Massinissa left almost no chances for escape of Syphax’s warriors, who were caught sleeping and utterly unprepared. The flames that started from the huts outside the palisades spread easily and engulfed the whole camp. All the exits were blockaded by the Romans, and numbers of unarmed soldiers were slaughtered; others were caught by the flames, as well as many pack animals, or trampled themselves to death at the gates. The same happened with the army of Hasdrubal. Its soldiers were awakened by the news that the neighbouring camp was ignited, and some of them rushed to help the Numidians without arms, thinking that the flames were result of an accident. Scipio waited <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>moment</b> of confusion to attack with his part of the Roman army. The Carthaginians could not offer any organized resistance and were crushed. Only their general (as well as Syphax), with a small body of troops, managed to escape.|$|E

500|$|... "Moments" [...] is a mid-tempo pop ballad. Written {{in the key}} of D major, {{the beat}} is set in common time and moves at a {{moderate}} 150 beats per minute. One Direction's vocal range in the song span from the note of D4 to A5. [...] "Moments" [...] utilises a gently strummed guitar and intermediate piano lines. Inspired by the breakdown of a relationship between Sheeran and an unnamed woman, the song's lyrics revolve around an unrequited love. The chorus of the song is essentially built on the hook, [...] "You know I'll be your life, your voice, your reason to be/ My love, my heart is breathing <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>moment</b> in time/I'll find the words to say/ Before you leave me today." ...|$|E

500|$|In the {{alternate}} timeline, Shannon {{does not go}} back with Boone. In [...] "LA X", Boone goes back alone on Flight 815 and sits beside Locke, where he finds out about Locke supposedly going on a Walkabout in Australia. In a parallel with the island timeline, Boone tells Locke if they crashed, he would follow him. Once the plane lands, Boone shakes Locke's hand and exits the plane. Boone reappears in the final episode of Lost. In [...] "The End", we see Hurley and Sayid talking in a car on a dark street, and they witness a thug beating up a guy (Boone) outside of a bar. Shannon shouts [...] "Leave my brother alone," [...] and Sayid {{gets out of the}} car to intervene. His and Shannon's memories are restored the moment they touch. Boone, having conspired with Hurley to bring Shannon and Sayid together, wanders over to the car. He jokes with Hurley about how he had to take a beating and [...] "thanks for taking your time." [...] He also comments how difficult it was to get Shannon to return from Australia with him, but he and Hurley agree the effort was worth it <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>moment</b> to have her and Sayid's memories restored. Boone is one of the first people Jack greets in the church where everyone reunites to move on to the afterlife together.|$|E
500|$|... "Freddy Spaghetti" [...] was {{the final}} episode to include Paul Schneider in any {{capacity}} after his two seasons as regular cast member as Mark Brendanawicz. Schneider left the series, and though Schur claimed that both the producers and Schneider were interested in having him return for guest appearances in future episodes, Schneider stated {{that he was not}} interested in returning and had never been contacted about it. The final scene between Leslie and Mark in [...] "Freddy Spaghetti", in which the two sit together at Lot 48, mirrors their scenes together in the first season finale, [...] "Rock Show", in which the two shared a kiss while overlooking the lot while it was still a construction pit. Schur said of the scene, [...] "It's great because Leslie and Mark, it was such a disastrous moment last time (at the pit) and he didn't really respect her, and a lot's happened in a year." [...] Goor said of using that setting, [...] "I liked the symmetry of having it play a critical, and opposite role in this finale. Last year, they sat on the bench and kissed, and it seemed like they might be getting back together. This year, they sat on the bench and Mark kissed Leslie goodbye." [...] The bench they sit in during that scene is the same one they sat on during their kiss scene in [...] "Rock Show". Throughout the second season, that bench was in Leslie's office. Schur said, [...] "We decided that in the reality of the show she brought it to the lot <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>moment.</b> It's {{a little bit of a}} stretch, but, you know." ...|$|E
500|$|Solo {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Andrew Liengard of Jazz Houston stated that Rubalcaba played [...] "at once a pyrotechnical and thunderous two-handed assault, he also demonstrates a profound awareness {{of space and}} dynamics," [...] and finally called the album [...] "stunning". Joey Guerra of Amazon said that Solo [...] "finds Rubalcaba soaring {{on the strength of}} his own talent", creating a [...] "unique experience." [...] Website Allmusic stated that the album is a spellbinding collection of improvisations with [...] "remarkable stylistic display." [...] Harvey Siders of JazzTimes commented that the album did not need elaborate arrangements, being a [...] "spontaneous inner dialogue from a brilliant inquisitive mind" [...] and that on Solo [...] "elegance trumps excitement." [...] PopMatters Robert R. Calder stated that the record was [...] "a very remarkable solo piano recital." [...] David Miller of All About Jazz gave the album a mixed review, being critical of the entertainment value, stating that the performer [...] "is more introspective than ever, frequently using silence as his means of expression. The only problem is, it doesn't necessarily work." [...] Miller also suggested that [...] "Rubalcaba should develop his ideas in more conventional settings. He still has time to become a great solo artist, and this writer has every confidence that he will." [...] In a separate review, Jim Santella, also of All About Jazz, praised Solo, commenting that Rubalcaba [...] "finds space in his exploratory interpretation for dreamy soliloquies, but the excitement is all there, and it's powerful. The pianist makes us wait <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>moment,</b> and it's always worth the anticipation. Ultimately he lights an inspiring fire." [...] Mark Corroto, in a third review of the album by All About Jazz, compared Rubalcaba's work to fellow Cuban artist Bebo Valdés, asseverating that both performers [...] "blurred the lines between jazz, classical and folk, easily convincing you there need be no distinction." [...] Timothy Sprinkle of Jazz Review declared that the performer [...] "carries the disc with a light, breezy ease that's surprising, especially given all of the slow selections." ...|$|E

She played her first match of her comeback on April 26 at the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix, a tournament that she had previously won on three occasions. Her first round opponent was Italian Roberta Vinci, who she went on to defeat in straight sets to advance to the second round, making it her first victory since her return. In her on-court interview Sharapova said, [...] "The first few seconds before you enter the arena – it's been a stage of mine since I was a young girl – I've been waiting <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>moment</b> for a long time."
