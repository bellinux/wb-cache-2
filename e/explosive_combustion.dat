40|$|In part I, we {{discussed}} the chain-propagating and possible competing mechanisms of low-temperature (300 - 1000 K) dimethyl ether (DME) combustion. Here we consider the chain-branching mechanism that results in <b>explosive</b> <b>combustion,</b> initiated by O 2 addition to the âCH 2 OCH 2 OOH intermediate formed in the earlier chain-propagation step. Ideally, chain-branching leads {{to the formation of}} two highly reactive âOH radicals from the âOOCH 2 OCH 2 OOH precursor. Each of these two âOH radicals can initiate a chain-reaction “branch” with another DME molecule, which, ideally, leads to the formation of four more âOH, and so on. This exponential increase in âOH concentration causes an exponential increase in the DME oxidation rate, leading to <b>explosive</b> <b>combustion.</b> Here we show that although the pathway to create the first âOH from âOOCH 2 -OCH 2 OOH in a hydrogen-transfer isomerization step is unambiguous, the formation of the second âOH from the remaining hydroperoxyformate (HPMF or HOOCH 2 OC(dO) H) fragment is potentially very complicated. HPMF has many possible fates, including HCœ O + formic acid (HC(dO) OH) + âOH; H 2 O + formic acid anhydride (HC(dO) OC(dO) H); the Criegee intermediate (âCH 2 OOâ) + formic acid; peroxyformic acid (HC(dO) OOH) + H 2 + CO; dihydroxymethylformate ((HO) 2 HCOC(dO) H); âOCH 2 OC(dO) H + âOH; and quite possibly others. The first and last of these products derived from HPMF directly produce âOH and thus can complete the chain-branching step.

40|$|A {{filtered}} progress variable {{approach is}} adopted for large eddy simulations (LES) of turbulent deflagrations. The deflagration model is {{coupled with a}} non-premixed combustion model, either an equilibrium-chemistry, mixture-fraction based model, or an eddy dissipation model. The coupling interface uses a LES-resolved flame index formulation and provides partially-premixed combustion (PPC) modeling capability. The PPC sub-model is implemented into the Fire Dynamic Simulator (FDS) developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which is then applied {{to the study of}} <b>explosive</b> <b>combustion</b> in confined fuel vapor clouds. Current limitations of the PPC model are identified first in two separate series of simulations: 1) a series of simulation corresponding to laminar flame propagation across homogeneous mixtures in open or closed tunnel-like configurations; and 2) a grid refinement study corresponding to laminar flame propagation across a vertically-stratified layer. An experimental database previously developed by FM Global Research, featuring controlled ignition followed by <b>explosive</b> <b>combustion</b> in an enclosure filled with vertically-stratified mixtures of propane in air, is used as a test configuration for model validation. Sealed and vented configurations are both considered, with and without obstacles in the chamber. These pressurized combustion cases present a particular challenge to the bulk pressure algorithm in FDS, which has robustness, accuracy and stability issues, in particular in vented configurations. Two modified bulk pressure models are proposed and evaluated by comparison between measured and simulated pressure data in the Factory Mutual Global (FMG) test configuration. The first model is based on a modified bulk pressure algorithm and uses a simplified expression for pressure valid in a vented compartment under quasi-steady conditions. The second model is based on solving an ordinary differential equation for bulk pressure (including a relaxation term proposed to stabilize possible Helmholtz oscillations) and modified vent flow velocity boundary conditions that are made bulk-pressure-sensitive. Comparisons with experiments are encouraging and demonstrate the potential of the new modeling capability for simulations of low pressure explosions in stratified fuel vapor clouds...|$|E
2500|$|The Emberverse series, or Change World, is {{a series}} of post-apocalyptic {{alternate}} history novels written by S. M. Stirling. The novels depict the events following a mysterious—yet sudden—worldwide event called [...] "The Change" [...] that occurred at 6:15 pm Pacific Standard Time, on March 17, 1998. [...] The Change altered both the course of history and all physical laws when it caused all the electricity, gunpowder, <b>explosives,</b> internal <b>combustion</b> engines, steam power and most forms of high-energy-density technology on Earth to permanently no longer work. Most of the action in the series takes place in the Willamette Valley of Oregon in the United States. The series primarily focuses on how the characters survive the loss of 600 years of technological progress. The original trilogy, Dies the Fire, concerns the conflicts between a Portland-based neo-feudalist dictatorship and the free communities of the Willamette Valley, primarily the Wiccan Clan Mackenzie and the Bearkillers. The later series, The Change, focuses on the now-adult children of the original trilogy's major characters. A third sub-series, beginning with The Golden Princess, is currently in progress, with the grandchildren of the original survivors as the central characters. The Emberverse is closely related to the preceding Stirling Nantucket series with The Event being the synonymous point of departure.|$|R

40|$|The end-Permian {{extinction}} decimated up to 95 % of carbonate shell-bearing {{marine species}} and 80 % of land animals. Isotopic excursions, dissolution of shallow marine carbonates, and {{the demise of}} carbonate shell-bearing organisms suggest global warming and ocean acidification. The temporal association of the extinction with the Siberia flood basalts at approximately 250  Ma is well known, and recent evidence suggests these flood basalts may have mobilized carbon in thick deposits of organic-rich sediments. Large isotopic excursions recorded in this period are potentially explained by rapid venting of coal-derived methane, which has primarily been attributed to metamorphism of coal by basaltic intrusion. However, recently discovered contemporaneous deposits of fly ash in northern Canada suggest large-scale combustion of coal as an additional mechanism for rapid release of carbon. This massive coal combustion may have resulted from explosive interaction with basalt sills of the Siberian Traps.

Progress in activities dealing with the hydrogen issue was achieved by performing experiments addressing these subjects: - hydrogen combustion with defined concentration gradients, - hydrogen mitigation via recombiners and the issue of self-ignition within a recombiner, - thermal-hydraulic phenomena in the containment (steam injection, condensation, sprays), - interaction between Passive Autocatalytic Recombiners and containment atmosphere. The experimental results are being used for benchmark simulations with both lumped parameter codes and CFD codes. The modeling results were discussed in numerous workshops with focus on large scale application. The experimental progress concerning the Fuel-Coolant Interaction (FCI) issue was delayed by the relocation of the KROTOS test facility to CEA, Cadarache.

40|$|Airborne dust {{generated}} by primary blasting was collected in Taff’s Well Quarry, {{just north of}} Cardiff, Wales. Collections of airborne particulate matter were also made in the nearby village of Morganstown {{at the same time}} as the blasting collections. The explosions were recorded on a motor-driven camera and a digital video camera. These images show that the dust clouds {{generated by}} the explosions consist of three distinct components; a reddish-grey dust cloud, followed by a light grey dust cloud, and finally a pale grey cloud that stayed near the blast face. It is believed that the reddish-grey cloud was composed mostly of mineral grains, as evidenced by the chiefly red colour of the dolomitic limestone rock in the quarry. The whiter clouds contained more <b>explosive</b> <b>combustion</b> particles (diesel soot). The samples were studied by analytical scanning electron microscopy, very high-resolution field emission scanning electron microscopy, and image analysis. The two different components (minerals and diesel soot) can be readily seen under high-resolution electron microscopy. Any consideration of the possible adverse health effects or nuisance value of this dust needs to consider both of these components. A size distribution of the quarry particles shows that soot particles dominate the assemblage under 2 μm, whereas the mineral grains are more abundant over 2 μm. This contrasts with the Morganstown particle sizes, where the two components show similar size distributions. The determination of the mineralogy of the quarry dust and Morganstown particles has shown highly complex and heterogeneous mixtures, though some distribution patterns are emerging. It is concluded that much of the dust in Morganstown probably originated from sources other than the quarry, such as other local industries, roads and construction sites...|$|E

Adopting the Hilmyer-Macosco protocol for ROMP of cyclooctadiene with CTAs bearing end-groups, improvements in monomer purifn. enabled synthesis of telechelics with unprecedented length (telechelic polymers with Mw> 400 kg/mol). Simple carboxylic acid - tertiary amine pairs are designed to provide complementary endassocn. that is amenable to scale up; surprisingly, they also proved to be more effective than such multidentate "stickers" as Hamilton receptor and cyanuric acid.

40|$|This {{project is}} aimed towards the defence industry, {{resulting}} {{in a lot of}} information being classified. This report is therefore written in a way so no sensitive and secrecy information is revealed. In today’s model of the Combat Vehicle 90 (CV 90), there is no self-sealing ability implemented into the fuel tank. When a projectile penetrates the fuel tank walls, the fuel will leak out. This master thesis is a pre-study {{to see what kind of}} available self-sealing applications there is on the market today and how these can be implemented into the fuel tank of the CV 90 in order to make the fuel tank leak proof if damaged. An extensive research phase has been conducted where theory regarding projectiles and ammunition, damage prevention, damage management and fuel tanks has been gathered. The theory part of the project is constructed with a top down philosophy where the fuel tank of the CV 90 is in centre. The theory chapter first focus on the threats present in a war zone. The next step is to prevent damage from happening by designing and dimensioning the CV 90 s fuel tank armour with the help of STANAG 4569 protection levels. If the armour is not sufficient enough and damage occurs anyway to the fuel tank, management of the damage can be dealt with by using different self-sealing techniques. For the viewer to understand the concept of a fuel tank better, theory has been gathered in the field of fuel tanks regarding fuel slosh, <b>explosive</b> <b>combustion,</b> fuel cells used in racing, history of self-sealing fuel tanks and different technical solutions in the form of patents and self-sealing applications provided by companies on the market today. The project is a pre-study in a Research and Development process. The process is divided into a knowledge part and a result part, where the knowledge part is the most extensive, consisting of planning the project, understanding the task and the problems in the project, research around the task and evaluating the researched material. The research consists of analysing the self-sealing market, analysing self-sealing patents and investigate self-sealing techniques in known literature. The benchmarking method has been a well-used tool during the project and especially during the research phase in order to analyse and structure the gathered data. The result part consist of an idea generation phase including brainstorming and an idea evaluation phase in which morphologic matrixes has been used for the evaluation of the brainstorming ideas. A meeting with the company GKN has been conducted with the purpose of gaining deeper knowledge of their self-sealing product and to create an understanding of how their self-sealing application could be fitted into the fuel tank of the CV 90. The last phase of the result part is the concept phase where six different concepts have been presented as the final result of this pre-study. Resulting data of the research phase has been presented in the result chapters of this report. The resulting concepts have been divided into three different categories being self-sealing fuel bladder, self-sealing coating and future concepts. The concepts are created to suit the needs analysis and the requirement specification stated in the beginning of the project. Two different concepts have been created for each category. The future concepts are created with no requirements in mind other than that they should be plausible to implement in a near future version of the CV 90, effectively removing the wildest concept ideas from the results in order to be realistic.
