40|$|Parenteral {{administration}} of Fatgen in amount of 100 - 800 c c. {{was carried out}} on 21 patients during postoperative period in association with other fluid therapy. Fatgen was appraised as follows. 1) Untow a rd effect of Fatgen was found only in one case (4. 7 %) {{in which case the}} effect was not as severe as to terminate {{administration of}} Fatgen. Fatgen was considered to be safe parenteral <b>fat</b> <b>derivative.</b> 2) Untoward effect of Fatgen on peripheral blood picture, blood protein, electrolytes, hepatic and renal functions was not observed. Other parenteral fluids, such as banked blood, glucose and synthetic amino acid derivatives can be safely, continuously, and simultaneously administered. Therefore, in the field of urology since Fatgen can be safely administered without consideration of electrolyte balance in the patients with renal dysfunction or electrolyte unbalance providing taking account of fluid balance, it is useful not only in the postoperative patients but in the patients with acute renal insufficiency. 3) The average reduction of body weight, 3. 23 kg, in the control group of postoperative patients was compared with that of the group to which fatgen was administration, whose reduction of body weight was only average 1. 92 kg. The reduction of the latter was only 60 per cent of the control group. 4) Satisfactory parenteral nutriti v e fluid is presently available as far as carbohydrate and protein are concerned and safe parenteral fat has long been expected.

5000|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} kinds of fats, but each is a variation on the same chemical structure. All <b>fats</b> are <b>derivatives</b> of fatty acids and glycerol. Most fats are glycerides, particularly triglycerides (triesters of glycerol). One chain of fatty acid is bonded to each of the three -OH groups of the glycerol by the reaction of the carboxyl end of the fatty acid (-COOH) with the alcohol; I.e. three chains per molecule. Water is eliminated and the carbons are linked by an -O- bond through dehydration synthesis. This process is called esterification and fats are therefore esters. As a simple visual illustration, if the kinks and angles of these chains were straightened out, the molecule would have the shape of a capital letter E. The fatty acids would each be a horizontal line; the glycerol [...] "backbone" [...] would be the vertical line that joins the horizontal lines. Fats therefore have [...] "ester" [...] bonds.|$|R

40|$|Human adipose-derived {{stem cells}} (hASCs) have been {{recently}} proposed as a suitable tool for regenerative therapies for their simple isolation procedure and high proliferative capability in culture. Although hASCs can be committed into different lineages in vitro, the differentiation is a low-yield and often incomplete process. We have recently developed a novel nonenzymatic method and device, named Lipogems, {{to obtain a}} <b>fat</b> tissue <b>derivative</b> highly enriched in pericytes/mesenchymal stem cells by mild mechanical forces from human lipoaspirates. When compared to enzymatically dissociated cells, Lipogems-derived hASCs exhibited enhanced transcription of vasculogenic genes in response to provasculogenic molecules, suggesting that these cells may be amenable for further optimization of their multipotency. Here we exposed Lipogems-derived hASCs to a radioelectric asymmetric conveyer (REAC), an innovative device asymmetrically conveying radioelectric fields, affording both enhanced differentiating profiles in mouse embryonic stem cells and efficient direct multilineage reprogramming in human skin fibroblasts. We show that specific REAC exposure remarkably enhanced the transcription of prodynorphin, GATA- 4, Nkx- 2. 5, VEGF, HGF, vWF, neurogenin- 1, and myoD, indicating the commitment toward cardiac, vascular, neuronal, and skeletal muscle lineages, as inferred by the overexpression of a program of targeted marker proteins. REAC exposure also finely tuned the expression of stemness-related genes, including NANOG, SOX- 2, and OCT- 4. Noteworthy, the REAC-induced responses were fashioned at a significantly higher extent in Lipogems-derived than in enzymatically dissociated hASCs. Therefore, REAC-mediated interplay between radioelectric asymmetrically conveyed fields and Lipogems-derived hASCs appears to involve the generation of an ideal “milieu” to optimize multipotency expression from human adult stem cells in view of potential improvement of future cell therapy efforts...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{growth of}} energy demand and limited fossil fuel {{resources}} lead to renewable energy development such as vegetable oils and animal <b>fats</b> or their <b>derivatives.</b> In the present work, the valuation of waste fish fat by the pyrolysis technique {{with the presence of}} catalyst to produce biofuel for diesel engines. As a result, fuel undergoes good combustion and hence there is a significant improvement in performance and reduction in emissions. The brake thermal efficiency of neat biofuel is 32. 4 % at 80 % load which is very high compared to neat diesel (29. 98 %). The combustion duration and ignition delay are decreased with neat biofuel due to high oxygen content and high cetane number of biofuel. The main problem with the use of neat biofuel in diesel engine is high NOx emissions at all loads. Addition of diesel with biofuel reduces the NOx emissions significantly from 917 ppm to 889 ppm at 80 % load with an optimum blend of B 80 D 20. There is a slight decrease in brake thermal efficiency and increase in particulate emission with this blend. The overall results show that by adding small quantity of diesel with biofuel decreases the NOx emissions significantly and approaches the performance of neat biofuel. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Nonalcoholic {{fatty liver}} disease (NAFLD) {{is a group}} of {{diseases}} with excess fat in liver {{in the absence of a}} poorly defined limit of alcohol consumption. Most common variety, a universal public health problem, is associated with insulin resistance caused by a host of genetic and epigenetic defects modulated by life style and environmental factors. In fact the term NAFLD is loose to incorporate so many etiologies except alcoholism and few other etiologies, presenting as fat in liver. However as a sign fatty liver is very important in predicting the risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, cirrhosis and cancer. Abnormal fat accumulation can result from several defects in nuclear receptors associated with lipid sensing, synthesis and oxidation like LXR, FXR, SREBP, ChREBP and PPAR; defects in the lipid influx-efflux channels, insulin signaling, proteins involved in fatty acid catabolism, defects in adipose tissue development and function, inappropriate nutrition and finally defects in neural regulatory mechanisms. The progress of the disease is determined by the basic defects which results in fat accumulation, an individual’s immunological response to the accumulated <b>fat</b> and its <b>derivatives</b> and the oxidant stress response. Congregation of unrelated genetic defects under same diagnosis ‘NAFLD’ can result in inefficient patient management. Further studies are required to understand the molecular basis of fatty liver to enable a personalized management of diseases presenting as fatty liver in the absence of alcohol abuse...|$|R

In order to improve the organoleptic properties of those products, whey protein concentrates (WPC) were added during the manufacturing process. Interest was focused during manufacturing and storage period on the contents of >healthy> fatty acids, mainly conjugated linoleic acid and n- 3 PUFA. Contents of these fatty acids were not affected by the manufacture practices and neither did addition of WPC during manufacturing nor cold storage cause their decrease. Percentages of total n- 3 fatty acids in <b>fat</b> from dairy <b>derivatives</b> enriched in PUFA after 21 d of storage (1. 45 %) were very close to those obtained before processing (1. 39 %).

40|$|The {{evolution}} {{in the history of}} nutrition knowledge towards dairy products, is strictly related to the socio-cultural development of humans. In fact, milk and butter have accompanied humans since ancient times, which traces of the consumption of such products are dated back about the earliest times after the last (glaciation) ice age, while the application for extra nutritional uses, such as cosmetics and ceremonial rites, are reported in the writings of the Old Testament. Even in Italy, before the Roman Empire, were known rudimentary techniques of production and storage of dairy products. But only {{with the advent of the}} Etruscans, and the Romans later, that the use of milk and dairy products reach a wide diffusion in several applications. Since the advent of Christ until today, milk and its derivatives have maintained a privileged place in the human diet, but it is only with the advent of modern medicine and new findings in lipidic chemistry that emerged multiple biological and nutritional properties, very important for human health. After a short summary of the ancient history of the milk and butter, the role of dairy products in cancer, in hypercholesterolemia, and cardiovascular disease are reported. Moreover, the current opinions on saturated fatty acids, the role of polyunsaturated fatty acids and their lipid mediators obtained by the action of cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase and the cytochrome P 450 enzymes, are treated. Even if sometimes mistreated, the milk, but most of all its high <b>fat</b> content <b>derivatives</b> such as butter, is a rich source of biologically active compounds that foster a controversial action against neolplastic and cardiovascular disease. These compounds, mainly contained in the lipid fraction, for the more obvious relationships that exist between nutrition and health status, have been the subject in the last decades of intense scientific investigation in which there were expressed lights and shadows, but recognizing that not all fats are harmful and further thorough studies are necessary, in particular, on the derived lipid mediators. This will allow a significant progress based on new scientific evidences, further orienting researchers and clinicians on evidencebased nutritional science...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1964 Recent {{studies have}} shown that when milk fat is heated, a {{homologous}} series containing the n-alkyl members of methyl ketones with odd numbers of carbon in their chains are produced (48; 44; 38; and 3). The same series of compounds also is found in evaporated and dried whole milk and in these products the concentration increases during storage (70 and 46). It is believed by some investigators that the methyl ketones {{play an important role in}} flavor deterioration of milk fat and in the aforementioned concentrated products. At the present time, however, there is disagreement on the factors influencing methyl ketone production; some workers relate their formation to autoxidation (25), while there are others who report that heat and water are essential in the reaction (48; 38 and 3). Finally, a recent report indicates that anhydrous milk fat will give rise to methyl ketones when heated in the absence of oxygen (44). The purpose of this investigation was to study the effect of various factors on the qualitative and quantitative composition of methyl ketones in heat treated milk fat. It is anticipated that the resulting information will contribute to a more thorough understanding of the reactions leading to ketone production in the fat; hence, to development of suitable processing measures for prevention of this type of deterioration in dairy products. Milk fat was prepared from raw cream two days after milking. It was washed free from phospholipids, centrifuged at 30, 000 x G for 20 minutes and degassed at two to five microns pressure for one hour. The fat was then heat treated in sealed vials at various temperatures and time periods under controlled conditions. The samples were quantitatively analyzed for methyl ketones by direct conversion of the ketones to 2, 4 -dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNP) derivatives in the intact <b>fat</b> sample. The <b>derivatives</b> were isolated from the fat, separated and identified by a combination of column and paper chromatographic methods and by their absorption spectra. Methyl ketone formation in heated milk fat was shown to be non-oxidative. A plateau in ketone production was approached in the 120 °C to 140 °C range when the time of heat treatment was 30 minutes. Added water enhanced total methyl ketone production at 140 °C but not at 200 °C. Air did not hinder ketone production. Maximum ketone production (1. 733 mM/kg fat) was noted after three hours of heat treatment at two to five microns pressure, and 140 °C. Milk fat centrifuged at 30, 000 x G for 20 minutes and degassed at two to five microns pressure for one hour was found to contain 0. 27...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the effectiveness of}} antioxidant compounds in modulating mitochondrial oxidative alterations and lipids accumulation in fatty hepatocytes. METHODS: Silybin-phospholipid complex containing vitamin E (Realsil®) was daily administered by gavage (one pouch diluted in 3 mL of water and containing 15 mg vitamin E and 47 mg silybin complexed with phospholipids) to rats fed a choline-deprived (CD) or a high fat diet [20 % fat, containing 71 % total calories as fat, 11 % as carbohydrate, and 18 % as protein, high fat diet (HFD) ] for 30 d and 60 d, respectively. The control group was fed a normal semi-purified diet containing adequate levels of choline (35 % total calories as fat, 47 % as carbohydrate, and 18 % as protein). Circulating and hepatic redox active and nitrogen regulating molecules (thioredoxin, glutathione, glutathione peroxidase), NO metabolites (nitrosothiols, nitrotyrosine), lipid peroxides [malondialdehyde-thiobarbituric (MDA-TBA) ], and pro-inflammatory keratins (K- 18) were measured on days 0, 7, 14, 30, and 60. Mitochondrial respiratory chain proteins {{and the extent of}} hepatic fatty infiltration were evaluated. RESULTS: Both diet regimens produced liver steatosis (50 % and 25 % of liver slices with CD and HFD, respectively) with no signs of necro-inflammation: fat infiltration ranged from large droplets at day 14 to disseminated and confluent vacuoles resulting in microvesicular steatosis at day 30 (CD) and day 60 (HFD). In plasma, thioredoxin and nitrosothiols were not significantly changed, while MDA-TBA, nitrotyrosine (from 6 1; 1 nmol/L to 14 1; 3 nmol/L day 30 CD, P < 0. 001, and 12 1; 2 nmol/L day 60 HFD, P < 0. 001), and K- 18 (from 198 1; 20 to 289 1; 21 U/L day 30 CD, P < 0. 001, and 242 1; 23 U/L day 60 HFD, P < 0. 001) levels increased significantly with ongoing steatosis. In the liver, glutathione was decreased (from 34. 0 1; 1. 3 to 25. 3 1; 1. 2 nmol/mg prot day 30 CD, P < 0. 001, and 22. 4 1; 2. 4 nmol/mg prot day 60 HFD, P < 0. 001), while thioredoxin and glutathione peroxidase were initially increased and then decreased. Nitrosothiols were constantly increased. MDA-TBA levels were five-fold increased from 9. 1 1; 1. 2 nmol/g to 75. 6 1; 5. 4 nmol/g on day 30, P < 0. 001 (CD) and doubled with HFD on day 60. Realsil administration significantly lowered the extent of fat infiltration, maintained liver glutathione levels during the first half period, and halved its decrease during the second half. Also, Realsil modulated thioredoxin changes and the production of NO derivatives and significantly lowered MDA-TBA levels both in liver (from 73. 6 1; 5. 4 to 57. 2 1; 6. 3 nmol/g day 30 CD, P < 0. 01 and from 27. 3 1; 2. 1 nmol/g to 20. 5 1; 2. 2 nmol/g day 60 HFD, P < 0. 01) and in plasma. Changes in mitochondrial respiratory complexes were also attenuated by Realsil in HFD rats with a major protective effect on Complex II subunit CII- 30. CONCLUSION: Realsil administration effectively contrasts hepatocyte <b>fat</b> deposition, NO <b>derivatives</b> formation, and mitochondrial alterations, allowing the liver to maintain a better glutathione and thioredoxin antioxidant activity...|$|R
40|$|The {{bones of}} the body vary in size and shape, but are {{fundamentally}} all composed of the same cell types: osteoblasts, osteoclasts, osteocytes, vascular cells, and sometimes marrow cells. Long bones are formed when mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) give rise to chondrocytes i. e. cartilage cells, and osteoblasts i. e. bone cells. These develop to form layers of bone encasing a cartilagenous core which eventually becomes the marrow cavity. A recent study showed that deleting the Wilms’ tumour gene, Wt 1, in adult mice causes a dramatic loss of bone and fat tissue, <b>fat</b> being another <b>derivative</b> of MSCs. This finding led me to ask whether Wt 1 expression is involved in bone biology and whether it plays a functional role in the stem or progenitor populations. Wt 1 is a transcription factor {{that acts as a}} mesodermal / mesenchymal regulator. It acts as a tumour suppressor gene with mutations leading to the eponymous paediatric kidney tumour. However, in adult cancers it has oncogene characteristics, being highly expressed in the tumours of tissues in which it is not normally present. It also plays a pivotal role in the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and vice versa in developing heart and kidney, respectively. There is, however, no evidence of its involvement with EMT / MET in adults. Wt 1 is expressed in various developing tissues and is particularly vital for kidney development. Due to its involvement as a regulator of EMT / MET during development and the phenotype observed following its deletion in vivo, we hypothesised that Wt 1 is expressed in, and required for the function of mesenchymal stem or progenitor cells populations within the bone marrow. A Wt 1 -GFP knock in mouse was used to show that Wt 1 expressing cells are found in the bone marrow, and also {{for the first time in}} the bone. The GFP population overlaps with a non-haematopoietic MSC population defined by 3 cell surface markers in the bone and marrow, as well as an osteoblast (OB) progenitor population. Using a tamoxifen inducible CreERT 2 showed that Wt 1 loss alters the proportion of GFP cells in the bone and marrow cells that overlap with these MSC and OB progenitor markers, but microarrays were needed to assess the functional effects of Wt 1 deletion. Microarrays highlighted various pathways that were altered following the in vitro deletion of Wt 1 in total bone and marrow culture, as well as the non-haematopoeitic GFP+ and GFP- populations. In bone cells, deleting Wt 1 negatively affects various pathways related to MSCs and their derivatives, including collagen biosynthesis, cartilage development and muscle tissue development. Also negatively affected were Wnt signalling regulation and EMT regulation; this is the first time Wt 1 has been shown to be involved in EMT in adult cells. These findings were validated using qRT-PCR to show the down regulation of various genes involved in each pathway, showing that as well as being expressed in these populations it is also playing a functional role. Ossification pathways were negatively altered in the cells not expressing Wt 1 following the deletion of the gene suggesting that Wt 1 may also be acting in a paracrine manner to play its role in bone homeostasis. As well as in adult tissues, Wt 1 was found to be expressed during development in the limb tissue of e 11. 5 to e 16. 5 mice. Preliminary results show that Wt 1 may also have a functional role during bone development, as loss of expression causes a reduction in the percentage of non-haematopoetic MSC cells in the e 18. 5 hindlimb. As well as this, preliminary lineage tracing experiments suggest that cells found at the bone surface are of Wt 1 + origin. This thesis has also highlighted the importance of experimental conditions and controls, particularly for CFU-F assays. CreERT 2, loxP sites, tamoxifen, oxygen tension levels, and gender all exert specific effects on colony formation, independent of Wt 1 expression. In conclusion, these data identify Wt 1 as a key player in bone development and homeostasis. The microarray results led to the conclusion that Wt 1 has a functional role in several mesenchymal pathways and highlights various genes that are potential Wt 1 targets and should be further investigated using ChIP-Seq methods...|$|R
