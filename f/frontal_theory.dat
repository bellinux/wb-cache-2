40|$|This {{study used}} fMRI to {{investigate}} {{the functioning of the}} Theory of Mind (ToM) cortical network in autism during the viewing of animations that in some conditions entailed the attribution of a mental state to animated geometric figures. At the cortical level, mentalizing (attribution of metal states) is underpinned by the coordination and integration of the components of the ToM network, which include the medial frontal gyrus, the anterior paracingulate, and the right temporoparietal junction. The pivotal new finding was a functional underconnectivity (a lower degree of synchronization) in autism, especially in the connections between frontal and posterior areas during the attribution of mental states. In addition, the <b>frontal</b> <b>Theory</b> of Mind regions activated less in participants with autism relative to control participants. In the autism group, an independent psychometric assessment of Theory of Mind ability and the activation in the right temporoparietal junction were reliably correlated. The results together provide new evidence for the biological basis of atypical processing of Theory of Mind in autism, implicating the underconnectivity between frontal regions and more posterior areas...|$|E
40|$|Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) in saline {{aquifers}} {{is drawing}} attention {{as a potential}} method to reduce the CO 2 -level in the atmosphere and hence mitigate the effect of global warming. In {{order to understand the}} complicated physics between CO 2 and brine at large depths, laboratory core-scale experiments with reservoir conditions can be performed, and the knowledge gained can help us maximize the amount of CO 2 stored. This thesis uses results from a previous study by the author (Westergaard, 2012), where capillary pressure and relative permeability saturation relationships were derived for a set of homogenous core samples. The results were used in the present study, for numerical simulations of the multi-phase immiscible flow of CO 2 displacing brine. The stability of the flow was investigated through a series of numerical simulation scenarios, where the interplay of viscous, capillary and gravitational forces was evaluated. Initially, an attempt was made to predict the stability of the flow using Buckley-Leverett <b>Frontal</b> <b>Theory</b> without considering capillary pressure and gravity. Predictions of the stability were made using the shock-front mobility ratio for a set of relative permeability curves related to the pore structure of the core samples. The predictions were then evaluated with numerical simulations. Although some of the predictions corresponded well to the simulations, a great number of them did not. Viscous fingering or channeling was seen in most of the simulated cases, and it was difficult to detect a clear separation of stable and unstable flow. Furthermore, new scenarios were made to investigate the stabilizing effect of capillary pressure and the segregation of gravity. Capillarity stabilizes the flow at great flow lengths that are considered realistic aquifer dimensions. The flow is stabilized since capillary pressure suppresses the formation of fingers. Gravitational effects cause a gas override in the displacement for low flow rates, but this effect is diminished as the gravity number decreases, and the viscous regime starts to dominate. The stabilizing effect of capillary pressure is not as powerful at increasing length scales, when gravitational forces are considered. Gas override quickly dominates the CO 2 -plume migration as the length of the domain increases, and no signs of projected streaks of gas can be seen. This conclusion of this thesis is that the density difference between CO 2 and brine should be the main concern for a CO 2 -sequestration project, and not the viscosity ratio. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{literature}} on age-related cognitive changes {{suggests that some}} older adults may begin to experience cognitive declines resulting in difficulty engaging in adaptive behavior necessary for functional independent living. Understanding {{the relationship between these}} cognitive and functional changes will be important for guiding researchers and clinicians in addressing this issue. Many theories regarding the underlying causes of cognitive aging have been proposed. Most causes appear to be related to changes in the efficiency and accuracy with which information is processed. Two current, competing hypotheses of cognitive aging include the processing speed theory of aging and the <b>frontal</b> lobe <b>theory</b> of aging; however, these theories propose two different mechanisms of cognitive change. Processing speed theory suggests that cognitive aging is a bottom-up process in which diffuse declines in a foundational cognitive process impact higher order cognitive functions. In contrast, <b>frontal</b> lobe <b>theory</b> suggests a top down process in that frontal lobe functions decline first and influence other processes in the brain. The current project examined data collected from a large multi-site sample during the Staying Keen in Later Life (SKILL) study. Specifically, the current study investigated both processing speed and <b>frontal</b> lobe <b>theories</b> of aging in an effort to determine which hypothesis best fit the data. It was observed that each model fit the data equally well, thus suggesting that both processes {{play a critical role in}} daily functioning. Additionally, the constructs overlapped substantially suggesting that the cognitive constructs may not be as separable as traditionally thought. Finally, the model was invariant across age groups and no differences were observed between young-old, middle-old, and old-old groups. ...|$|R

The waterflooding technique, in which oil is displaced by injecting water into the underlying petroleum reservoir, is investigated for the reservoir field where oil extraction has not been started. The effectiveness of the waterflooding technique is demonstrated by laboratory experiments using a horizontal plane model. The relative permeabilities of oil and water, residual oil saturation and irreducible water saturation are inspected through the experiments. The theory is then applied to the Angut oilfield to evaluate the amount of oil recovery from Angut oilfield by waterflooding technique.|$|R

30|$|When {{reservoir}} engineers {{analyze the}} waterflood performance, they {{resort to the}} conventional <b>frontal</b> advance <b>theory</b> of Buckley and Leverett (1942). With Buckley–Leverett method, oil recovery from waterflood is calculated and required water injection volume to achieve that oil recovery is estimated. This method does provide a very useful tool in waterflood design. Welge (1952) proposed a tangent construction method to estimate the water saturation, water fraction at the water front and oil recovery factor. Several other investigators studied the multilayer reservoir waterflood performance. Stiles (1949) investigated the multilayer reservoir displacement by assuming the displacement velocity in a layer to be proportional to its absolute permeability. Dykstra and Parsons (1950) developed their famous multi-permeability model for noncommunicating layers without crossflow. Hearn (1971) derived expressions for communicating stratified reservoirs using the pseudo-relative permeability functions. El–Khatib (1999) advanced the closed form analytical solution for communicating stratified systems with log-normal permeability distributions.

40|$|Recently {{increasing}} {{oil production}} from petroleum reservoirs {{is one of}} the most important issues in the global energy sector. So, in this paper, the recovery of oil by the waterflooding technique from petroleum reservoir are considered. To investigate the aforementioned phenomena, the relative permeability of two immiscible fluids in sand is measured in the laboratory based on the steady-state method. Two sorts of oils, kerosene and heavy oil, and water are pumped simultaneously into a vertical sand column with different pumping ratio. From the change in fractional discharge measured at the outlet, a method for determining the relative permeability is developed focusing on the displacement mechanism in sand. Then, displacement mechanism of two immiscible fluids in the sand is investigated under the Buckley-Leveret <b>frontal</b> displacement <b>theory</b> and laboratory experiment. Two sorts of experiments, one is the displacement of pore water by oil, the other is the displacement of pore oil by water, are carried out.

40|$|Inhibition is {{a central}} {{construct}} to the <b>frontal</b> lobe <b>theory</b> of ageing, yet its construct validity remains unproven. Furthermore, age effects on measures of inhibition are often reported without adequate control {{for the effects of}} global slowing on performance. We investigated inhibitory function in older adults in two experiments. In Experiment 1, 49 people with ages between 59 and 86 (mean= 70 years 9 months S. D. = 7. 54) completed four analogues of the Stroop interference paradigm. To control for global slowing and to enable comparisons across all measures, we used a random effects model based on log-transformed response times. Age did not contribute significantly to the model and the estimated correlation between tasks was not significant. In Experiment 2, 33 people with ages between 62 and 86 (mean= 73 years 4 months, S. D. = 6. 57) were compared on two measures of Stroop-like interference which were very similar in surface task demands. Age did not contribute significantly to the model but the estimated correlation between tasks was robust (r= 0. 714). We conclude that age may make little contribution to inhibitory function independently of other factors such as speed and intelligence. Second, that the level of individual consistency in the performance of measures of inhibition will depend on the similarity of the tasks used...|$|R
40|$|Background. The {{ability to}} inhibit {{inappropriate}} or unwanted actions {{is a key}} element of executive control. The existence OF executive function deficits in schizophrenia is consistent with <b>frontal</b> lobe <b>theories</b> of the disorder. Relatively few Studies have examined response inhibition in schizophrenia, and none in adolescent patients with early-onset schizophrenia (EOS). Methods. Twenty-one adolescents with (lie onset of clinically impairing psychosis before 19 years of age and 16 matched controls performed a stop-signal task to assess response inhibition. The patients with EOS were categorized Lis paranoid (n= 10) and Undifferentiated subtypes (n= 11). The undifferentiated group had higher levels of negative symptomatology. Stop-signal reaction time (SSRT) and go-signal reaction time (Go-RT) were analysed with respect to hand of response. Results. The Undifferentiated early-onset patients had significantly longer SSRTs, indicative of poor response inhibition, for the left hand compared to the paranoid early-onset patients and control participants. No differences existed for inhibitory control with the right hand. The three groups did not differ in Go-RT. Conclusions. Our results indicate a specific lateralized impairment of response inhibition in patients With Undifferentiated, but not paranoid, EOS. These findings are consistent with reports of immature frontostriatal networks in EOS and implicate areas such as the pre-motor cortex and Supplementary motor area (SMA) that are thought {{to play a role in}} both voluntary initiation and inhibition of movement...|$|R
40|$|Application of {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) techniques reveals that human brain aging varies across cortical regions. One area particularly sensitive to normal aging is the frontal lobes. In vitro neuropathological studies and behavioral measures in a canine model of aging previously suggested that the frontal lobes of the dog might be sensitive to aging. In the present study, MRI scans were acquired to compare age-related changes in frontal lobe volume with changes in executive functions and �-amyloid pathology in the frontal cortex of beagle dogs aged 3 months to 15 years. Decreases in total brain volume appeared only in senior dogs (aged 12 years and older), whereas frontal lobe atrophy developed earlier, appearing in the old dogs (aged 8 – 11 years). Hippocampal volume also declined with age, but not occipital lobe volume past maturity. Reduced frontal lobe volume correlated with impaired performance on measures of executive function, including inhibitory control and complex working memory, and with increased �-amyloid accumulation in the frontal cortex. Age-related hippocampal atrophy also correlated with complex working memory but not inhibitory control, whereas occipital lobe volume did not correlate with any cognitive measure. These {{findings are consistent with}} the <b>frontal</b> lobe <b>theory</b> of aging in humans, which suggests that the frontal lobes and functions subserved by this region are compromised early in aging.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the predictive value of measures of working memory capacity on executive performance within a real-world setting, and to assess the contribution of midlife aging to performance on both measures. Ten young adults (mean age 20. 6 years) and ten middle-aged adults (mean age 45. 4 years) completed an automated version of the Operation Span task as a test of working memory span. Participants also performed the Virtual Errands Task, a computerised test of multitasking ability similar to the Multiple Errands Task. All associations between Operation Span score and performance in the Virtual Errands Task were found to be non-significant, supporting the notion of working memory capacity being a more accurate measurement of the executive process of 'Updating' as opposed to being reflective of differences in overall frontal lobe functioning and central executive capability. Midlife aging was found to have a significant negative affect on performance on both tests. Regression indicated that midlife aging accounted for 32. 4 % and 35. 6 % of the variance on performance on the Operation Span and Virtual Errands Test respectively (p < 0. 01 for both measures). Within the Virtual Errands Task, midlife aging was found to have a significant negative effect on realistic planning and task-switching ability. These results are interpreted in lieu of <b>frontal</b> lobe <b>theories</b> of aging, and suggest that cognitive decline in the studied executive processes’ neuroanatomical correlates occurs early in adult life...|$|R
40|$|It is {{difficult}} to use industrial explosives to excavate hard rock and achieve suitable blasting effect due to the low energy utilization rate resulting in large rocks and short blasting footage.

40|$|Abstract Background This paper {{reports the}} {{development}} of an in-vitro technique allowing quantification of relative (not absolute) deformations measured {{at the level of the}} cancellous bone of the tibial proximal epiphysis (CB TPE) during knee flexion-extension. This method has been developed to allow a future study of the effects of low femoral osteotomies consequence on the CB TPE. Methods Six strain gages were encapsulated in an epoxy resin solution to form, after resin polymerisation, six measurement elements (ME). The latter were inserted into the CB TPE of six unembalmed specimens, just below the tibial plateau. Knee motion data were collected by three-dimensional (3 D) electrogoniometry during several cycles of knee flexion-extension. Intra- and inter-observer reproducibility was estimated on one specimen for all MEs. Intra-specimen repeatability was calculated to determine specimen's variability and the error of measurement. A varum and valgum chirurgical procedure was realised on another specimen to observed CB TPE deformation after these kind of procedure. Results Average intra-observer variation of the deformation ranged from 8 % to 9 % (mean coefficient of variation, MCV) respectively for extension and flexion movement. The coefficient of multiple correlations (CMC) ranged from 0. 93 to 0. 96 for flexion and extension. No phase shift of maximum strain peaks was observed. Inter-observer MCV averaged 23 % and 28 % for flexion and extension. The CMC were 0. 82 and 0. 87 respectively for extension and flexion. For the intra-specimen repeatability, the average of mean RMS difference and the mean ICC were calculated only for flexion movement. The mean RMS variability ranged from 7 to 10 % and the mean ICC was 0. 98 (0. 95 - 0. 99). A Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated showing that RMS was independent of signal intensity. For the chirurgical procedure, valgum and varum deviation seems be in agree with the <b>frontal</b> misalignment <b>theory.</b> Conclusions Results show that the methodology is reproducible within a range of 10 %. This method has been developed to allow analysis the indirect reflect of deformation variations in CB TPE before and after distal femoral osteotomies. The first results of the valgum and varum deformation show that our methodology allows this kind of measurement and are encourageant for latter studies. It will therefore allow quantification and enhance the understanding of the effects of this kind of surgery on the CB TPE loading. </p...|$|R
40|$|A NOAA P- 3 {{instrumented}} aircraft observed an intense, fast-moving narrow cold frontal rainband (NCFR) as it {{approached the}} California coast on 19 February 2001 during the Pacific Coastal Jets Experiment. Airborne Doppler radar data obtained while the frontal system was well offshore {{indicated that a}} narrow ribbon of very high radar reflectivity convective cores characterized the rainband at low levels with echo tops to; 4 – 5 km, and pseudo-dual-Doppler analyses showed the low-level convergence of the prefrontal air. The NCFR consisted of gaps of weaker reflectivity and cores of stronger reflectivity along its length, perhaps {{as a result of}} hydrodynamic instability along its advancing leading edge. In contrast to some earlier studies of cold <b>frontal</b> rainbands, density-current <b>theory</b> described well the motion of the overall front. The character of the updraft structure along the NCFR varied systematically {{along the length of the}} precipitation cores and in the gap regions. The vertical shear of the cross-frontal low-level ambient flow exerted a strong influence on the updraft character, consistent with theoretical arguments developed for squall lines describing the balance of vorticity at the leading edge. In short segments at the northern ends of the cores, the vertical wind shear was strongest with the updrafts and rain shafts more intense, narrower, and more erect or even downshear tilted.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the bifurcations, i. e., the emergent behaviours, for the Waikato cortical model {{under the influence}} of the gap-junction inhibitory diffusion D₂ (identified as the Turing bifurcation parameter) and the time-to-peak for hyperpolarising GABA response γi (i. e., inhibitory rate-constant, identified as the Hopf bifurcation parameter). The cortical model simplifies the entire cortex to a cylindrical macrocolumn (∼ 1 mm³) containing ∼ 10 ⁵ neurons (85 % excitatory, 15 % inhibitory) communicating via both chemical and electrical (gap-junction) synapses. The linear stability analysis of the model equations predict the emergence of a Turing instability (in which separated areas of the cortex become activated) when gap-junction diffusivity is increased above a critical level. In addition, a Hopf bifurcation (oscillation) occurs when the inhibitory rate-constant is sufficiently small. Nonlinear interaction between these instabilities leads to spontaneous cortical patterns of neuronal activities evolving in space and time. Such model dynamics of delicately balanced interplay between Turing and Hopf instabilities may be of direct relevance to clinically observed brain dynamics such as epileptic seizure EEG spikes, deep-sleep slow-wave oscillations and cognitive gamma-waves. The relationship between the modelled brain patterns and model equations can normally be inferred from the eigenvalue dispersion curve, i. e., linear stability analysis. Sometimes we experienced mismatches between the linear stability analysis and the formed cortical patterns, which hampers us in identifying the type of instability corresponding to the emergent patterns. In this thesis, I investigate the pattern-forming mechanism of the Waikato cortical model to better understand the model nonlinearities. I first study the pattern dynamics via analysis of a simple pattern-forming system, the Brusselator model, which has a similar model structure and bifurcation phenomena as the cortical model. I apply both linear and nonlinear perturbation methods to analyse the near-bifurcation behaviour of the Brusselator in order to precisely capture the dominant mode that contributes the most to the final formed-patterns. My nonlinear analysis of the Brusselator model yields Ginzburg-Landau type amplitude equations that describe the dynamics of the most unstable mode, i. e., the dominant mode, in the vicinity of a bifurcation point. The amplitude equations at a Turing point unfold three characteristic spatial structures: honeycomb Hπ, stripes, and reentrant honeycomb H₀. A codimension- 2 Turing–Hopf point (CTHP) predicts three mixed instabilities: stable Turing–Hopf (TH), chaotic TH, and bistable TH. The amplitude equations precisely determine the bifurcation conditions for these instabilities and explain the pattern-competition mechanism once the bifurcation parameters cross the thresholds, whilst driving the system into a nonlinear region where the linear stability analysis may not be applicable. Then, I apply the bifurcation theories to the cortical model for its pattern predictions. Analogous to the Brusselator model, I find cortical Turing pattens in Hπ, stripes and H₀ spatial structures. Moreover, I develop the amplitude equations for the cortical model, with which I derive the envelope frequency for the beating-waves of a stable TH mode; and propose ideas regarding emergence of the cortical chaotic mode. Apart from these pattern dynamics that the cortical model shares with the Brusselator system, the cortical model also exhibits “eye-blinking” TH patterns latticed in hexagons with localised oscillations. Although we have not found biological significance of these model pattens, the developed bifurcation theories and investigated pattern-forming mechanism may enrich our modelling strategies and help us to further improve model performance. In the last chapter of this thesis, I introduce a Turing–Hopf mechanism for the anaesthetic slow-waves, and predict a coherence drop of such slow-waves with the induction of propofol anaesthesia. To test this hypothesis, I developed an EEG coherence analysing algorithm, EEG coherence, to automatically examine the clinical EEG recordings across multiple subjects. The result shows significantly decreased coherence along the fronto-occipital axis, and increased coherence along the left- and right-temporal axis. As the Waikato cortical model is spatially homogenous, i. e., there are no explicit front-to-back or right-to-left directions, it is unable to produce different coherence changes for different regions. It appears that the Waikato cortical model best represents the cortical dynamics in the <b>frontal</b> region. The <b>theory</b> of pattern dynamics suggests that a mode transition from wave–Turing–wave to Turing–wave–Turing introduces pattern coherence changes in both positive and negative directions. Thus, a further modelling improvement may be the introduction of a cortical bistable mode where Turing and wave coexist...|$|R
