500|$|In a mixed review, Billboard editor Jason Lipshutz {{published}} a track-by-track review of each {{song on the}} album. He thought that the single did not {{fit in with the}} rest of Hell: The Sequel, but alone, is a good song, [...] " [...] track doesn't fit with EP, but Em's effortless confidence carries the celebratory anthem." [...] Chad Grischow of IGN gave a shared a similar opinion, calling the song odd and uncommon. Grischow did not favor the influences of [...] "gooey synthpop" [...] and soul fusion genres. However, the critic appreciated the [...] "inspirational verses" [...] from Eminem and Royce and summarized, [...] "In the end, this brief look at the duo's skills does not fully deliver what you expect, but still leaves you wanting to hear more." [...] Web magazine Plugged In Online, once a magazine that published reviews from a Conservative Christian's perspective, praised Mars' singing but harshly criticized the duo's lyricism, [...] "These two Detroit rappers use a lot more nasty words to get the job done". The reviewer, Adam Holz, went on to analyze Royce's verse, [...] "Toss in nods to toking marijuana and two allusions to oral sex, and you've <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> good picture of what Royce's vision of 'living out our dreams' looks like in action." [...] While exploring the Billboard charts on their segment at The A.V. Club, writers Genevieve Koski and Steven Hyden, commented on [...] "Lighters". Koski said that the single shared some similarities with [...] "Nothin' on You", which also featured Mars. Despite noticing the contrast between the rap verses and the hook, she focused her attention on the various elements of the recording which [...] "are each uplifting in their own way" [...] and awarded it a B–. On the other hand, Hyden gave the song a harsh critic calling it the, [...] "absolute worst in pop music right now". He criticized Eminem for spitting in his verses, Mars for singing a [...] "melodramatic chorus" [...] and the type of music the rapper, Eminem, was embracing dubbing it, [...] "maudlin power balladry". He gave the record an F.|$|E

That's so lowbrow!' I want to tell them, 'Well, I'm real glad you've <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> face, because I worked for 20 years doing that stuff and I feel it's really invaluable; it really taught me a lot.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Initial {{reception}} of the individual singles was generally positive. Chris Harris of Gun Shy Assassin, and also writer for MTV and Rolling Stone, praised Daryl Palumbo's vocals on [...] "All Good Junkies Go to Heaven" [...] and noted that the guitars sounded [...] "vibrant, hypnotic, and ethereal — sometimes {{all at the same}} time." [...] Harris also observed a slight electronic element, possibly influenced by Palumbo's side project Head Automatica. As the first single released, Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound didn't feel that [...] "All Good Junkies Go to Heaven" [...] measured up to the five years of anticipation for new Glassjaw material, but noted, [...] "it's <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> catchy, driving beat that's quick and technically sound and features some decent lyricism to boot." ...|$|E

2500|$|Blake’s {{internally}} braced hollow wooden surfboards {{were eventually}} superseded by laminated boards with an interior layer of balsa, then by foam-and-fiberglass designs, but {{another of his}} innovations remains a fixture of modern surf- and paddleboards, the [...] "skeg" [...] or fin. Traditional surfboards were flat-bottomed, but in 1935, Blake experimented by tearing the keel off an old speedboat and attaching it {{to the bottom of}} a surfboard. Blake later remembered, [...] "I finally put the fin on the board and went out in the surf, paddled out. In paddling out, the board had an entirely different feeling with the skeg on it, it wasn't entirely a likable feeling... But I <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> good wave and right away found the remarkable control you had over the board with the skeg on it. It didn't spin out, it steered easy, because the tail held steady when you put the pressure on the front. You could [...] turn it any way you wanted it. I knew right from that moment it was a success. I consider it as my good solid contribution to the sport. It gives me a lot of pleasure when I see the kids drive by in [...] their cars with a fin on their board." ...|$|E
2500|$|Strom {{was born}} December 15, 1927 in Pottstown, Pennsylvania to Max and Bessie Strom. Earl's father, Max, was a foreman at a bakery, and Earl {{grew up in}} the {{household}} as the youngest of seven children comprising five boys and two girls. As a child, he became interested in athletics and competing in sports, and this interest lasted throughout his childhood and into high school. At Pottstown High School, Strom played football, baseball, and basketball. After finishing high school in 1945, he joined the United States Coast Guard towards the end of World War II. [...] Returning from service, Strom attended Pierce Junior College in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where he graduated in 1951. Following school, the young Strom continued participating in sports and played for a local semi-professional basketball team in his early 20s. During a basketball game, he had an argument with a referee and the referee said [...] "Look, you're not much of a player, and you've <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> good mouth on you, so why don't you think about taking up refereeing?" [...] Following the advice of the referee, Strom decided to get into officiating. He officiated high school games for nine years as well as college games in the East Coast Athletic Conference for three years.|$|E
2500|$|There was a brawl on pit road {{involving}} Jeff Gordon, Brad Keselowski and Kevin Harvick. Keselowski and Harvick {{were parked}} in the post-race impound area where the cars that finished second through sixth are held for post-race inspection. Gordon pulled his car and parked it right beside Brad's car. He got out and had a level-headed conversation with {{the driver of the}} No. 2 Ford that seemed to make him more angry. As Keselowski was putting on his Miller Lite cap, Kevin proceeded to shove him towards Gordon and all hell broke loose. Multiple pit crews from the three racing stables as well as Paul Menard's crew were involved (Keselowski's spot in the impound area was in the pit stall of the No. 27 car). ESPN's Jamie Little was {{caught in the middle of}} it. “We’re racing for the win,” said Keselowski of the on track contact. “ to wreck him, just racing hard. He left a hole and you know, everything you watch in racing, you leave a hole, you’re supposed to go for it. It closed back up and we made contact. I don’t want to ruin anyone’s day. I want to win the race and that was our opportunity. Just didn’t come together.” “I spun the tires a little bit but I <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> decent start and we went down into one and I just wanted to get to the outside of the 48 [...] and out of nowhere, I got slammed by the 2 and it cut my left rear tire. He's just a dipshit," [...] Gordon said in a nationally televised interview on ESPN. [...] "I don't know how he's ever won a championship. I'm just sick and tired of him. ... That was a huge race for us. I'm proud of Jimmie Johnson for winning that race. I didn't want that you-know-what (Keselowski) to win that race. ... (Keselowski) gets himself in this position himself and as far as I'm concerned he's got to pay the consequences. … It's total crap. The kid is just doing stuff way over his head." [...] “I'm not trying to sit here and sugarcoat it and try to be The Intimidator,’’ Keselowski said. “That's not what I'm trying to say. My expectation is if there's a gap, they'll go for it. If there's a gap, I'll go for it. If it closes up, there's contact, then that's racing. And that's what happened today. Will those guys race me hard or harder than others? Absolutely, I'm certain they will. But that's just part of it. I can't fault them for that. I just feel like I have to go for the gap if it's there, and I have to race the way I race or I won't even be in NASCAR. I'd rather have enemies in NASCAR than have friends and be sitting at home.’’ “If you’re going to drive like that, you better be willing to fight,’’ Harvick said he told Keselowski. “He was going to stand behind his guys. Jeff Gordon deserved to at least have a face-to-face conversation with him. I wasn’t standing up for anybody. (Keselowski) just ran over (Gordon). He was standing back behind all his guys, not wanting to defend what he did. I said, ‘You’re the problem, get in your own fight.’ ‘’ Robin Pemberton, NASCAR's senior vice president of competition, said that series officials will review what took place to determine what, if any, penalties will be issued. “Holding onto each other and grabbing… that's one thing. When punches are landed, it's a different scenario," [...] Pemberton said.|$|E

500|$|Actor Joshua Jackson {{believed}} the episode was important developmentally for the series, explaining it was [...] "creatively {{when the show}} really hit its stride in the first season."

60|$|As {{the reader}} must, by this time, have <b>a</b> <b>pretty</b> {{accurate}} idea of our manner of marching in the wilderness, I shall not dwell on {{this part of}} our proceedings any longer.
