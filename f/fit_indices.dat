He struggled through Wittgenstein and Kant to a passable understanding of each, being strongly influenced by Kant's concepts of analysis and synthesis in thought, and saw their role in metaphors of objectivity, causality, and the self. He published several articles in the journal Philosophy of Science on the history of exploratory statistics in empiricism; metaphoric origins of objectivity, subjectivity and consciousness; a synthesis of deterministic and probabilistic causality with the functional relation concept; and the curve-fitting problem and degrees of freedom. He was strongly influenced by the works of George Lakoff on metaphor and abstract thought and their origin in embodied perception and action. As a result, Mulaik has argued that science is based on the metaphor that [...] "science is knowledge of objects". In 1997 he was co-editor with L. Harlow and J. H. Steiger of the book What If There Were No Significance Tests? in which he was the principal author of a chapter with N Raju and R. Harshman defending significance tests in appropriate contexts. In 2009 he published the text Linear Causal Modeling with Structural Equations and in 2010 a revision of the earlier Foundations of Factor Analysis.|$|E

The study results show that all <b>fit</b> <b>indices</b> are more sensitive to misspecifications on the within level than those on the between level structure of the model. On the within level, all <b>fit</b> <b>indices</b> are more sensitive to the misspecification in the covariance structure than that in the residual structure; on the between level, all <b>fit</b> <b>indices</b> are more sensitive to the misspecification in the marginal mean structure than that in the covariance structure.

Partially-saturated estimation method helps NFI, TLI, and Mc {{to be sensitive to the}} appropriate sample size when evaluating the misspecification in the between-level covariance structure; however, it helps none of the <b>fit</b> <b>indices</b> when detecting models misspecified in the between-level covariance structure. All <b>fit</b> <b>indices</b> are principally influenced by the severity of misfit if it happens on the within level; however, they are primarily affected by group size if the misspecification occurs at the between level. When severity level increases, all <b>fit</b> <b>indices</b> have more power to detect misspecification in the within-level covariance structure. When group size increases, NFI, TLI, CFI, Mc, and RMSEA are more likely to commit Type II errors in detecting misspecifications in the marginal mean structure and in both the marginal mean and the covariance structures. Compared with other <b>fit</b> <b>indices,</b> NFI is most vulnerable to sample size and least sensitive to severity level of misfit. SRMR, however, behaves differentially from all other <b>fit</b> <b>indices</b> in that it is most sensitive to the intraclass correlation coefficient when detecting studied misspecifications on the between level structure.
