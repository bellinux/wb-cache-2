The state Office of Emergency Preparedness declared 61 injuries on the American side and police claimed that 30 were injured in Mexico. The Red Cross stated that cuts from broken glass, bruises from <b>falling</b> <b>objects,</b> and a few broken bones were reported. California's Interstate 8 developed cracks in it, but vehicles were still able to traverse the highway. The CaliforniaHighwayPatrol warned drivers that use of the road would be at their own risk.|$|E
25|$|The {{surface of}} the Earth is rotating, {{so it is not}} an {{inertial}} frame of reference. At latitudes nearer the Equator, the outward centrifugal force produced by Earth's rotation is larger than at polar latitudes. This counteracts the Earth's gravity to a small degree – up to a maximum of 0.3% at the Equator – and reduces the apparent downward acceleration of <b>falling</b> <b>objects.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{strength}} of the gravitational field is numerically equal to the acceleration of objects under its influence. The rate of acceleration of <b>falling</b> <b>objects</b> near the Earth's surface varies very slightly depending on latitude, surface features such as mountains and ridges, and perhaps unusually high or low sub-surface densities.

25|$|John Philoponus (ca. 490–ca. 570), {{also known}} as John the Grammarian, a Christian Byzantine philosopher, {{launched}} {{a revolution in the}} understanding of physics by critiquing and correcting the earlier works of Aristotle. In the process he proposed important concepts such as a rudimentary notion of inertia and the invariant acceleration of <b>falling</b> <b>objects.</b> Although his works were repressed at various times in the Byzantine Empire, because of religious controversy, they would nevertheless become important to the understanding of physics throughout Europe and the Arab world.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, NASA {{released}} a detailed report on survivability {{aspects of the}} Columbia reentry. The crew would have had {{less than a minute}} between the beginning of orbiter disintegration and depressurization. The structural failure of the left wing set off alarms in the cabin, although they {{had no way of knowing}} that the wing had broken apart as the rear of the orbiter could not be seen from the cabin. All evidence indicated that the crew frantically tried to regain control of Columbia as it began to spin out of control, but the loss of the left wing caused the orbiter to yaw to the right, exposing its underside to extreme aerodynamic forces and causing total structural disintegration. The crew cabin separated from the rest of the orbiter and rapidly depressurized, which would have killed or incapacitated the astronauts within seconds. Afterwards, the cabin spun around at high RPM, which caused the seat restraints on their upper bodies to fail. They were thus whipped around violently and pummeled by flying and <b>falling</b> <b>objects</b> from the disintegrating cabin, along with their heads and necks being slammed against the helmets, which were not designed to provide any head protection. Even if the cabin had remained structurally intact and reached a lower altitude where air could refill it, the high altitude depressurization would have been fatal to the astronauts unless they received medical attention within 5 minutes, approximately the amount of time it would take between cerebral hypoxia and brain death.|$|E
500|$|The men who removed {{this rock}} were called [...] "high scalers". While {{suspended}} {{from the top of}} the canyon with ropes, the high-scalers climbed down the canyon walls and removed the loose rock with jackhammers and dynamite. <b>Falling</b> <b>objects</b> were the most common cause of death on the dam site; the high scalers' work thus helped ensure worker safety. One high scaler was able to save life in a more direct manner: when a government inspector lost his grip on a safety line and began tumbling down a slope towards almost certain death, a high scaler was able to intercept him and pull him into the air. The construction site had, even then, become a magnet for tourists; the high scalers were prime attractions and showed off for the watchers. The high scalers received considerable media attention, with one worker dubbed the [...] "Human Pendulum" [...] for swinging co-workers (and, at other times, cases of dynamite) across the canyon. To protect themselves against <b>falling</b> <b>objects,</b> some high scalers took cloth hats and dipped them in tar, allowing them to harden. When workers wearing such headgear were struck hard enough to inflict broken jaws, they sustained no skull damage, Six Companies ordered thousands of what initially were called [...] "hard boiled hats" [...] (later [...] "hard hats") and strongly encouraged their use.|$|E

A Burger King restaurant had part of its ceiling come down. Northwest of Bishop, a portion of U.S. Route 395 was blocked temporarily by a landslide. Campers were briefly trapped at the Pleasant Valley Reservoir when a [...] section of an access road was destroyed as a result of land movement. Both injuries that were reported (minor cuts and injuries from <b>falling</b> <b>objects)</b> occurred to the north in Chalfant Valley where 53 mobile homes were knocked off their foundations and two homes were destroyed.

500|$|For eight hours, the Japanese {{island of}} Iriomote-jima {{reported}} gale-force winds, except for during the eye passage of Soudelor. The island reported sustained winds of 108km/h (67mph), with gusts to 204km/h (127mph). On Ishigaki Island, the storm caused ¥77.9million (2003JPY, $655,000 2003USD) in agriculture damage, mostly from high waves. Soudelor dropped heavy rainfall throughout Japan, peaking at [...] in Kagoshima Prefecture; {{most of the}} precipitation fell in about 24hours. A North Korean cargo ship was stranded off the northwest coast of Japan after being refused entry into the Japanese port of Toyama. During the storm, about 10,000houses lost power, including 3,400houses in Okinawa Prefecture. Damage was minor, with only 26damaged houses, varying from blown off roof tiles to shattered windows. Soudelor injured 21people in the country, mostly due to <b>falling</b> <b>objects.</b> There were at least 22landslides nationwide. Four bridges along the Yoshino River were flooded during the storm.|$|E

In this works a computational model is formulated to simulate dynamic floor vibration induced by impact. The floor vibration is simulated for various sized damper masses. A proof-of-concept experimental apparatus was fabricated to represent a floor with an impact damper. This example system consists of an acrylic plate, a ball for <b>falling</b> <b>object,</b> and an impact damper.

Galileo was instrumental in describing the characteristics of <b>falling</b> <b>objects</b> by determining that the acceleration of every object in free-fall was constant and independent of the mass of the object. Today, this acceleration due to gravity towards the surface of the Earth is usually designated as [...] and has a magnitude of about 9.81 meters per second squared (this measurement is taken from sea level and may vary depending on location), and points toward the center of the Earth.

In their analysis of the video, Popjustice commented that the <b>falling</b> <b>objects</b> convey an environment of excitement, saying: [...] "the general idea here is that something exciting is happening and someone is so excited by the exciting thing that they have dropped their drink." [...] Several couples are shown removing their clothes, stripping down to their underwear, and proceeding to kiss and caress each other. Minogue then rises up from the inside of a [...] "mountain of writhing bodies" [...] and a flock of doves flies around them. Her attire consists of a black bra, similar to the one Madonna wore in the 1990 music video of [...] "Vogue", wore underneath a [...] "shredded" [...] white top coupled with white go-go boots and knee-pads. She continues singing the song while laying atop the pyramid of couples and changes her position as the song approaches its second verse. A convertible {{standing in the middle of}} a road is shown releasing a bunch of white balloons from its top. The scene switches back to Minogue, from where the camera pans upward to reveal a large white inflatable elephant floating in between two skyscrapers. The flash mob continues growing in size and the height of the pyramid increases. Minogue sways her hand above the participants of the mob, emphasising rings and jewellery designed by UK-based jeweller Shaun Leane. During of the bridge section of the song, Minogue is pulled inside the pyramid and the lighting is dimmed down. The song's breakdown coincides with scenes of a white horse galloping on a road amid various couples kissing each other. As the chorus begins, Minogue again rises up and stands atop the pyramid, which has greatly increased in height. Popjustice pointed out that the increment in the height of the pyramid is reflective of the lines of the song in which Minogue repeats the word [...] "higher". The camera switches to a distant view of the scene, showing the pyramid in between the skyscrapers and the floating elephant and balloons. The video ends with Minogue realising a dove in the air.|$|E
