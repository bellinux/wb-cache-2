5|$|Some of the {{legislation}} is observed {{with high levels of}} compliance, but not uniformly throughout the country. There are not mandatory fines for smoking transgressions, although the newest 2016 anti-smoking campaign has seen fines issued and offenders threatened with images of them being broadcast on TV. Tobacco packaging warning messages are required on all types of packaging, but their appearance is not regulated in any way. They are usually printed in small print {{on the side of the}} package and only state that smoking is harmful to health. However, the descriptions must state the nicotine and tar content, must not be misleading and do need to be approved by local authorities. Graphic warning <b>images</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> now common worldwide have never appeared on packaging.|$|E

25|$|The art of Eastern Catholicism {{has always}} been rather closer to the Orthodox art of Greece and Russia, and in {{countries}} near the Orthodox world, notably Poland, Catholic art has many Orthodox influences.

25|$|Art {{for social}} inquiry, {{subversion}} and/or anarchy. While similar to art for political change, subversive or deconstructivist art may seek to question aspects of society without any specific political goal. In this case, {{the function of}} art may be simply to criticize some aspect of society. Graffiti art {{and other types of}} street art are graphics and <b>images</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> spray-painted or stencilled on publicly viewable walls, buildings, buses, trains, and bridges, usually without permission. Certain art forms, such as graffiti, may also be illegal when they break laws (in this case vandalism).|$|E
25|$|Optical illusions (also called visual illusions) are {{characterized}} by visually perceived images that differ from objective reality. The information gathered by the eye is processed in the brain to give a percept that differs from the object being imaged. Optical illusions can {{be the result of}} a variety of phenomena including physical effects that create <b>images</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> different from the objects that make them, the physiological effects on the eyes and brain of excessive stimulation (e.g. brightness, tilt, colour, movement), and cognitive illusions where the eye and brain make unconscious inferences.|$|E
25|$|We ought, then, to set {{up images}} of a kind that can adhere longest in memory. And we shall do so if we {{establish}} similitudes as striking as possible; if we set up <b>images</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not many or vague but active; if we assign to them exceptional beauty or singular ugliness; if we ornament some of them, as with crowns or purple cloaks, so that the similitude may be more distinct to us; or if we somehow disfigure them, as by introducing one stained with blood or soiled with mud and smeared with red paint, so that its form is more striking, or by assigning certain comic effects to our images, for that, too, will ensure our remembering them more readily.|$|E

In 2008, Bird (1998–2007), the artist’s long-running photographic series of taxidermied Icelandic wildfowl were shown for the first time. Photographed at close range against white backgrounds (as though obeying the conventional format of studio portraiture) the birds are viewed from behind, their unique physiognomies and markings resulting in inscrutable shapes and patterns on the photographs’ surfaces. Despite the singular form of the title the birds in this series are all presented in pairs, <b>images</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> hung side by side one another highlighting the differences and similarities between the two.|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{the image}} {{resolution}} of an SEM {{is lower than}} that of a TEM. However, because the SEM images the surface of a sample rather than its interior, the electrons do not have to travel through the sample. This reduces the need for extensive sample preparation to thin the specimen to electron transparency. The SEM is able to image bulk samples that can fit on its stage and still be maneuvered, including a height less than the working distance being used, often 4 millimeters for high resolution images. The SEM also has a great depth of field, and so can produce <b>images</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> good representations of the three-dimensional surface shape of the sample. Another advantage of SEMs comes with environmental scanning electron microscopes (ESEM) that can produce images of good quality and resolution with hydrated samples or in low, rather than high, vacuum or under chamber gases. This facilitates imaging unfixed biological samples that are unstable in the high vacuum of conventional electron microscopes.|$|E
500|$|Franklin {{asserts that}} {{powerful}} communications technologies have reshaped {{political and social}} realities distancing people {{from each other and}} their immediate environments. Radio and television for example, transmit messages instantaneously from afar—messages that are separated from people's experiences in the vicinities where they live and work. Franklin calls such messages pseudorealities. She writes they are based on <b>images</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> constructed, staged and selected to create emotional effects and the illusion of [...] "being there" [...] as a participant, not just as an observer. She asserts however, that one-way communications technologies reduce or eliminate reciprocity, the normal give and take of face-to-face communication.|$|E

500|$|The main shrine {{houses the}} [...] Shaligram (black stone) image of Badrinarayan, which {{is housed in}} a gold canopy under a Badri Tree. The image of Badrinarayan holds a Shankha (conch) and a Chakra (wheel) in two of its arms in a lifted posture and two arms are rested on its lap in a Yogamudra (Padmasana) posture. The sanctum also houses images of the god of wealthKubera, sage Narada, Uddhava, Nar and Narayan. There are fifteen more <b>images</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> also worshipped around the temple. These include that of Lakshmi (the consort of Vishnu), Garuda (the vahana of Narayan), and Navadurga, the manifestation of Durga in nine {{different}} forms. The temple also has shrines of Lakshmi Narasimhar and for saints Adi Shankara (788-820), Vedanta Desika [...] and Ramanujacharya. All the idols of the temple are made of black stone.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for Fall Out Boy's [...] "Beat It" [...] was {{directed}} by Shane Drake and was made in homage to Jackson. [...] "I think when you're doing a Michael Jackson cover, there's this expectation that you're going to do one of his videos verbatim," [...] Stump said. [...] "What {{we decided to do}} was kind of inspired by Michael Jackson and the mythology of him. There are specific <b>images</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> reference points for us, but at any given point, it's not any of his videos. It's kind of all of his videos, all at once, but on a Fall Out Boy budget, so it's not quite as fancy." [...] The costumes for the video were similar to the originals. [...] "My costume is this take on one of the guys from Michael Jackson's original 'Beat It' video, like, the guy who plays the rival dancer," [...] Wentz said during the filming of the video. The music video featured numerous cameos, including a karate class/dance session being taught by Tony Hale, Donald Faison and Joel David Moore dressed up like Michael Jackson. The short film later received a MTV Video Music Award nomination for Best Rock Video.|$|E
