40|$|A gender {{revolution}} {{has transformed the}} <b>institution</b> <b>of</b> <b>asylum</b> in the United States. The introduction of gender-based persecution laws and policies {{in the past decade}} ushered in a new era of politics in asylum decisions. Facilitated by recent laws and policies, immigrant women may gain asylum and legal entry into the U. S. by claiming they are persecuted based on factors such as female circumcision, honor killings, domestic violence, coercive family planning, forced marriage, or repressive social norms. Immigrant advocates have championed these laws and policies as reflecting the canonical feminist declaration that women's rights are human rights. The legal recognition that certain human rights abuses are gendered because they overwhelmingly happen to women has emerged as the benchmark for gendered equality in asylum adjudication. However, legal recognition of gender-related persecution is only half the story. A study of the implementation of gender-based persecution laws and policies makes visible certain assumptions about femininity, masculinity, sexuality, race, class, and nation in which asylum seekers, immigration attorneys, service providers, immigration judges, and asylum officers engage when making, preparing, and adjudicating asylum claims. In this dissertation, I offer empirical evidence of how gender structures the legal <b>institution</b> <b>of</b> <b>asylum</b> in the United States...|$|E

40|$|The Statute of 1950 {{deliberately}} excludes {{persons who}} have not crossed an international border from UNHCR’s competence and yet, nearly half the people assisted by UNHCR today are internally displaced.

40|$|Although {{the vast}} {{majority}} of Syrians flee to neighboring countries, an increasing number is trying to reach European soil. On one end of the spectrum, individuals escape their war-torn country seeking protection elsewhere and on the other end the European Union (EU) and its Members States bear specific obligations for granting protection, stemming from their international and regional legal commitments. Drawing from the UNHCR estimations that the exodus is evolving rapidly and in light of Article 80 TFEU and the objectives by the European Council, the EU needs to adopt policies which emphasize the full and inclusive application of the 1951 Refugee Convention and promote a fair distribution of asylumrelated responsibilities amongst EU states. The present article investigates how the Syrian refugee crisis triggers practices of sharing within the EU. It describes how the different EU sharing mechanisms have been responding to the asylum-related pressures and critically analyzes their distributive effects. The main proposition is that the way in which sharing is being understood in the European asylum policies and applied in the areas covered by those policies (protection and treatment of individuals, European agencies’ role, relations between the EU and third countries) has significant consequences on the <b>institution</b> <b>of</b> <b>asylum</b> and the protection granted...|$|E

40|$|Ilias Anagnostakis and Anna Lambropoulou An {{instance}} of {{the implementation of the}} Byzantine <b>institution</b> <b>of</b> <b>asylum</b> in the Peloponnese: the Slavs seek sanctuary in the Church of St Andrew of Patrai The events which took place in the Peloponnese in the early ninth century (c. 800) are recorded in later sources, mostly of the tenth century. Following the establishment of the theme system of territorial administration and the securing of ecclesiastical order in the region, the emperor Nikephoros I, in implementing his new fiscal and economic policy, took steps {{to increase the number of}} inhabitants by systematically encouraging the settlement of new population groups from outside the area. It was within this general context and during this same period that the rebellion of the Slavs in Achaia, as described by Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus, needs to be viewed. Clearly, also, the phenomenon needs to be seen within the context of the specific social climate of the region where radical change was taking place and significant breaks with the past were occurring. During the repression of the rebellion the Slavs sought sanctuary in the church of the Apostle Andrew. As a result of this move, however, the rebels were given special treatment as they were viewed as having repented their actions. This was an occurrence whose more general implications are worthy of further study. Looked at from the broader ecclesiastical and political perspective, there are certain characteristic features to be noted in the attitudes towards asylum and the priority ascribed to ecclesiastical over civil law in Constantinople at the end of the eighth and the beginning of the ninth centuries. At the beginning of the ninth century, during the reign of Nikephoros I and while Tarasios was on the patriarchal throne (784 - 806), the flight of the defeated Slavs to the Church of St Andrew and the relative leniency that was shown them by the state suggest that here we are dealing with an {{instance of}} the workings of the institution of sanctuary in Byzantium. While the sources bring in a host of hagiographie and miraculous elements -the standard baggage of accounts of Christianisation and repentance-he flight of the Slavs to the church of the patron saint of the city constitutes, in our opinion, in instance of mass asylum. Moreover, it is interesting to observe that the respective terminology which was used in Porphyrogenitus' account and was in all likelihood included in the sigillion of Nikephoros I relies, in our view, directly on Byzantine legislative reforms concerning sanctuary. This is the first recorded instance of mass asylum and resort to church sanctuary in the middle Byzantine period in the Peloponnese. An effort was made both on the part of the church and the state to find a compromise solution: the former sought recognition of the institution of sanctuary while the latter was concerned to maintain the authority of its judicial and penal organs. The Slavs, who had sought sanctuary in the church, while normally liable to the punishment reserved for insurrection, were in the end granted special treatment. A compromise was found: despite the Slavs' attempt to rebel against the Byzantine authorities, the <b>institution</b> <b>of</b> <b>asylum</b> was fully implemented with the imposition of a number of restrictions and sanctions against the Slav population. The economic side of this treatment, which was generally a feature of the institution of ecclesiastical asylum both in Byzantium and the medieval West, has been well investigated. Indeed, monasticism and land ownership in the region of Bithynia are thought to have developed thanks to the institution of monastic asylum and the geographical boundaries of asylum, and this appears to be the case in the Peloponnese, too, where we see privileges and sigillia being granted for new monasteries and metropoleis in the ninth century. It is particularly interesting to note that the limits of 'rural asylum', i. e. the legal delimitation of the concepts of asylum and imperial donations, are lumped together with the estates of the church or monastery. The transfer of the exploitation of cultivable land to the workers of the monastery or church very often led to the development of settlements in the area. Seen in this light, the introduction of the <b>institution</b> <b>of</b> <b>asylum</b> and its legal delimitation in the case of the ecclesiastical estates of Achaia are directly related to the settlements of the early ninth century. It is probable that in contrast to the case of Syria and Bithynia asylum was not the catalyst behind the gradual settlement of the region of Achaia. However, and more importantly, it did offer solutions to the problems arising from the settlements. In the case of Patrai groups of unruly and discontented peasant populations developed an allegiance to the metropolis and were subsequently integrated to the point that they became entitled to protection from every epinoia adikos ('unjust design'). Subsequent to the Patrai episode - as far as the evidence allows us to construe- the Empire turned its military operations to the unsubdued, mountainous and more southerly regions of the Peloponnese. By contrast, the Slavs of Achaia were granted sigillia guaranteeing protection from any unapproved measures or epinoia adikos of the metropolitan. The flight of the Slavs to the Church of St Andrew following the miraculous intervention of the Apostle Andrew and the repression of the revolt, as well as the special treatment that they then received at the hands of the Byzantine authorities on account of their seeking sanctuary in the church, can be seen to constitute a form of asylum that is entirely consistent with the political and social climate and with the concept of asylum of the age of Nikephoros I.  Further investigation of the sigillia and their authenticity and reliability as sources may help to improve our understanding of the implementation and development of the <b>institution</b> <b>of</b> <b>asylum</b> in Byzantium during the reign of Nikephoros I.  </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} {{of the international community}} currently seems to alternate progressive impulses towards greater protection of human rights and sudden fallout in the traditional concept of territorial sovereignty. In a stage characterized by an increasingly restrictive admission of foreign nationals within the borders of the State and collective expulsions, what is the scope of the secular <b>institution</b> <b>of</b> <b>asylum?</b> Whether, on the one hand, the right of asylum is one of the state powers to freely adjust the entry and stay of aliens on its territory, considered as a corollary of territorial sovereignty, from the viewpoint of the individual it would constitute a means of further guarantee for fundamental rights. From this dilemma between state interest and human rights the present study will move to trace a possible balance between the protection of national security and the protection of human rights in one of the regions most affected by international migrations, like the euro-Mediterranean region. For these reasons, the hypothesis in this dissertation is the existence of a right of individuals to be granted asylum under International Human Rights and Refugee Law. The premise for this research is necessarily the assertion that individuals may be, even though only in part, subjects of International Law, as right holders vis-a-vis States. In conclusion, it is noted that attempts to claim a fundamental right to asylum, where have not engendered ad hoc set of laws, standing in provisions “still confused and often rudimentary”, they have contributed to conceive the right to asylum as a human right of subsidiary nature, likely to complete other inalienable rights, such as the right to life and physical integrity. The research is divided into 2 parts, including 2 chapters respectively. The first chapter develops the traditional theoretical framework under which the work is conducted. It examines the {{evolution of}} asylum through traditional international law and the study comes to identify, in the gradual emergence of a humanitarian nature of asylum, the symptoms of a change in the approach to such legal institution. The second chapter further elaborates on the possible evolution of asylum as a human right, assessing the course of non-refoulement and the jurisprudential contribution of the human rights treaty-monitoring bodies to the acceptance of a right to de facto asylum. The third chapter examines the legal developments in the field of asylum in the European Union, and how this special 'supra-national' legal order relates to the rights of refugees under International Refugee and Human Rights Law. The fourth chapter examines the legal conception of asylum in some other international organizations and legal systems of the Mediterranean and highlights the risks for an effective asylum-seeker protection, hidden in some bilateral readmission agreements...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDoes law produce spaces {{where it}} no longer applies? Does it, in other words, set up spaces of lawlessness? The {{question}} seems almost rhetorical given the growing body of work inspired by Agamben's notions of the camp' and state of exception'. Indeed, {{in the past decade}} or so, this question has been guiding much research in various disciplines, with human geography probably at the forefront, and unsurprisingly so given that the question is as spatial as it is legal. But {{this is not the first}} encounter between law and geography. There are, in fact, two different theoretical strands to human geographers' engagement with the relationship between law and space, one rooted in the critical legal studies movement, and the other, more recent one, in Agamben's work. The former, usually called critical legal geography, is animated by a concern to see law not as timeless and independent of social life, but as shaped by, and in turn shaping, social relations, identities, and power structures öto see law, as Delaney (2003) succinctly put it, ``as a thing of this world''. Law, in this view, is not merely prohibitive, but also productive; it is constitutive of the spaces of social life. Furthermore, it has a geographical specificity; despite its claim to universality, the where of law matters. The latter strand is more concerned with the spatiality of law and sovereign power. What animates this growing body of work is the idea that law may actually be involved in producing spaces of lawlessness, although what is in question is not the absence of law as such but violence committed through law. It is this latter strand that seems to be the more prominent one in contemporary legal ^ spatial research. This shift in focus from spaces of law to spaces of lawlessness is not simply rhetorical (`because Agamben had this idea [...] . '), but circumstantial. This is perhaps best evidenced by the recurrent references to Guanta¨amo and military campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq, which have become the paradigmatic examples of much writing on space, law, and sovereignty. (1) Compared with such high-profile examples, however, the issue of asylum has received relatively little attention, despite the worrying developments in the European Union's (EU) asylum law and policy in the past decade or so. This is not to suggest that asylum has been completely neglected by geographers; nor that the <b>institution</b> <b>of</b> <b>asylum</b> is in good health elsewhere in the world. However, the shape EU asylum law and policy has been taking deserves attention from the perspectives both of spaces of law and spaces of lawlessness as it has spatial manifestations in a variety of forms (detention centres, transit zones, appropriated city streets) and a range of places, including those beyond the territorial boundaries of member states. It not (1) Although the practices of the US government in the aftermath of September 11 brought onto the stage the issue of detention of foreigners, Dow (2004) shows that an appalling and largely obscure system of detention for so-called illegal immigrants' had existed in the US well before that.

40|$|What is ‘political asylum’? Klaus Neumann {{explores the}} history and {{meaning of the term}} MUCH of what has {{recently}} been said or written about political asylum has been confusing. What exactly is political asylum? Is there a difference between political asylum and territorial asylum? And what about the people who are nowadays most commonly labelled asylum seekers: those who arrived in Australia on rickety boats from Indonesia and who ended up in the Port Headland, Curtin, Woomera, Baxter, Christmas Island, Nauru and Manus detention centres - were they seeking the same kind of asylum that Mr Chen sought? A great deal of the recent confusion {{is due to the fact}} that the debate about Australia’s response to asylum seekers and refugees has been largely devoid of a well-informed historical perspective, and that as a result commentators have tended to view what is happening now as the norm, rather than as the exception or as something that became the norm. I am going to say a bit more about the history of the institution of political asylum in a few minutes. There is another reason for that confusion. Following Mr Chen’s defection, the government has been busily muddying the waters. And here, ‘the government’ is for once not synonymous with the indomitable Minister for Immigration, Senator Amanda Vanstone, but with her colleague, Alexander Downer. Of course, when Mr Chen went public with his story on 4 June, journalists turned their attention to the usual suspect. But on 6 June, Amanda Vanstone told the ABC: ‘If you want to ask about any reason why this person has not been given territorial asylum then those questions should go to the minister responsible for that, which is in fact the Minister for Foreign Affairs. ’ Vanstone was right. While her department is responsible for issuing visas to those given political (or ‘territorial’) asylum, it is her colleague, Alexander Downer, who has the executive power to grant such asylum. But when journalists put asked Downer why Mr Chen’s request had been refused, he merely obfuscated the issue. ‘Well, look there have been only [...] . two cases as far as I know in Australian history where asylum of that kind - political asylum - has been given - in the Petrov case, and I think there was one other case, a very long time ago,’ he said on 7 June in Chennai. The next day, he added: ‘Well, he [Chen] didn’t lodge a formal application at all. ’ Did Mr Chen lodge a formal application? Was he required to lodge one? Who dealt with, and declined his application? And is it true that Australia has granted political asylum only twice? Were there only two requests? And if there were more, then what happened to the unsuccessful asylum seekers? Thanks to the current Senate inquiry into asylum and protection visas, it is now well established that Mr Chen sought political asylum in a letter hand-delivered to the Immigration Department’s Sydney office on 26 May; that that letter was almost immediately faxed to the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra; that Minister Downer’s office was made aware of the matter that same day; that, by the next morning, Downer had decided to decline Chen’s request; and that on 3 June Mr Chen applied for a protection visa, which was granted in early July. In the course of that inquiry, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade confirmed that its minister may, at his discretion, grant political asylum to anybody requesting it. A request may be made orally or in writing. There are no forms to fill in. The granting of political asylum is an executive act. Successful asylum seekers are issued with a visa by the Department of Immigration. There is a special visa category for people granted political asylum by the Minister for Foreign Affairs: subclass 800. Subclass 800 visas are, according to the migration regulations, for persons who have been granted ‘territorial asylum’. Both this term, and the term ‘political asylum’ have been used to refer to the asylum sought by Mr Chen. Both terms are correct. Territorial asylum is not some arcane privilege that is so rare that hardly anybody has ever been afforded it. It is one form of political asylum. The other is extra-territorial asylum (also sometimes referred to as diplomatic asylum). That is what the Bahktiyari boys sought - unsuccessfully - when they entered the British consulate in Melbourne a couple of years ago. That’s what Cardinal Mindszenty sought - and was granted - when fleeing to the United States embassy after the Soviet Union put down the popular uprising of October 1956 in Hungary. The processes triggered by a request for political asylum on the one hand, and by an application for a protection visa, on the other, are very different. One requires an executive decision informed by the minister’s judgment, the other sets in train a very bureaucratic process in which a person’s claim to be a refugee is assessed in the light of well-defined criteria. The minister’s decision is discretionary and non-reviewable. The immigration department’s assessment of a person’s refugee claim can be contested before the Refugee Review Tribunal. But the privileges sought by Mr Chen on 26 May, when he requested political asylum, and on 3 June, when he applied for a protection visa, are very similar. In both cases he sought Australia’s protection, including a guarantee that he would not be extradited or otherwise returned to China. You may have noticed that I have already surreptitiously introduced a historical perspective when mentioning Cardinal Mindszenty. Let me now refer to the past in a more systematic fashion. The institution of political asylum is at least two-and-a-half thousand years old. The Greek city states knew about and respected it. A citizen of, say, Sparta, who feared for his life for reasons to do with his politics, could seek, and be granted, asylum in, say, Athens. The system worked as long as the state which the asylum seeker had fled, in this case Sparta, was not powerful enough to make the harbouring state extradite the asylum seeker. In European history, the <b>institution</b> <b>of</b> <b>asylum</b> did not survive unchanged from the fifth-century BC to the twenty-first century AD. But, to cut a very long story very short, in nineteenth-century Europe the situation was again similar to that in fifth-century Greece. The twentieth century saw a major new development prompted by mass flights and mass expulsions. From the 1920 s, international organisations charged with representing the interests of stateless people and of refugees promoted solutions whereby refugees would be protected by international law. In 1951, several countries, including Australia, collaborated in drafting the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. Article 1 of that convention defines those to be protected by it, namely persons who are outside their own country and unwilling to return to it ‘owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. ’ To cut another very long story very short, over the next few decades many countries acceded to the 1951 Convention and its 1967 Protocol and incorporated their terms into domestic legislation. Australia didn’t sign the Protocol until 1973, and then waited another few years before making the terms of the Convention become part of its domestic law. But today, usually anybody in Australian territory who is seeking Australia’s protection fills in an application for a protection visa. The application is approved if, to cite the Immigration Department’s website, the applicant is ‘found to be owed Australia’s protection under the Refugees Convention’, that is if that person is outside their own country owing to well founded fear of being persecuted, etc, etc. So what happened in Australia before 1973 ? Until 1956, Australia did not have an asylum seeker policy. In large part that was a reflection of Australia’s geographical position: Australia had to deal with very few asylum seekers. They included, of course, Australia’s most famous asylum seekers, Vladimir and Evdokia Petrov, who were granted political asylum in 1954. On 16 October 1956, Cabinet approved ‘of the principle that political asylum and refuge should be available in appropriate instances to various categories of aliens namely Olympic Games visitors, members of visiting trade and other delegations, members of diplomatic and consular missions in Australia, certain other defectors and Asian leaders’. The policy was applied when several Eastern European athletes sought to stay in Australia after the conclusion of the 1956 Olympic Games. Before 1973 (in fact, until the Determination of Refugee Status Committee, DORS, was set up in 1978), requests for asylum were decided much like Mr Chen’s application of 26 May: by the foreign minister, in consultation with other relevant ministers and ASIO. Hundreds of people sought asylum in Australia or its territories before 1973. They were not required to fill in a form or to formulate their request in writing. Among those requesting political asylum before 1973 were diplomats and their dependants; seamen from Eastern Bloc countries; three naval ratings deserting a Portuguese frigate in 1961; a stowaway who feared to be deported to the People’s Republic of China; and others. In the 1960 s and early 1970 s, West Papuans crossing from Indonesian-controlled West Irian into the Australian Territory of Papua and New Guinea comprised the majority of asylum seekers. While receiving hundreds of asylum requests, the government has granted political asylum on very few occasions (although more than twice). In these high-profile cases the ‘propaganda value’ was expected to outweigh any ensuing diplomatic repercussions. They included that of Ryszard Stanislaw Zielinski, the Commercial Consul at the Polish Consulate-General in Sydney, who defected in 1961. In many other instances, the government categorically ruled out the option of granting political asylum (as it did in Mr Chen’s case), but at the same time allowed asylum seekers to remain in Australia or its territories. Many (but by no means all) West Papuan asylum seekers were granted five-year permissive residence visas. In 1965, External Affairs officers persuaded a defecting Burmese diplomat to ‘apply for permanent residence in the normal way (having been assured that his case would certainly receive sympathetic and prompt attention) ’. There were other cases, most notably those involving Eastern European athletes in 1956, where the government did not formally grant political asylum but where the Australian public understood that to have happened. So far, I have tried to sketch the historical background to two procedures: one involving a request for political asylum, the other an application for a protection visa. I have also tried to clear up some of the misunderstandings that resulted from Alexander Downer’s public statements about Mr Chen’s asylum claim. Downer was muddying the waters because he did not want to say why he had refused Mr Chen’s initial request. Governments let their decisions about refugee and asylum claims be influenced by a combination of four factors: • the so-called national interest (or, perhaps more accurately, Macchiavelli’s ragione di stato, reasons of state) • public opinion • legal obligations, and • humanitarian considerations. The national interest could come into play for several reasons: the granting of asylum potentially affects the relations between the asylum seeker’s country of origin and the country granting asylum, as it could be interpreted as an act undermining the sovereignty of the former (before Papua New Guinea became independent, West Papuan asylum seekers were never granted political asylum because External Affairs was afraid of offending the Indonesian government); some asylum seekers and refugees may be perceived to be security threats; asylum seekers may be considered an economic liability or an economic asset; the granting of asylum may be seen to subvert existing immigration policy; and finally, in some cases, a state may offer political asylum as an incentive (in the case of Vladimir Petrov, the then solicitor-general, Kenneth Bailey, suggested that asylum should not be simply offered to Petrov to ‘save his skin’ but only ‘for something we get out of it’). The second factor, public opinion, played an important role in the decision to offer asylum to Evdokia Petrova, who, unlike her husband, was not considered to be of ‘intelligence value’. In her case, the Menzies government was afraid to be accused of condoning her forced repatriation to the Soviet Union. International public opinion may also influence the decisions of governments, although arguably a country’s international reputation is a matter of national interest. During the Cold War, Western governments often considered asylum seekers from Eastern Bloc countries assets in an ideological war. When the Australian government formulated its asylum seeker policy in 1956, it was mindful of what the relevant Cabinet submission termed the ‘propaganda value’ of asylum cases. The third factor, legal obligations, is only relevant in the case of a person claiming to be a refugee in the terms of the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol. But in that case, it can easily be the most important factor. The fourth factor, humanitarian considerations, is often linked to the second, public opinion, for a government may grant political asylum in cases where the domestic public strongly empathises with the asylum seekers - even if government members do not share the public’s humanitarian concerns. There is nothing wrong in principle with a government refusing a request for political asylum in the national interest - provided the asylum seeker’s interests are safeguarded. Thus it was not Alexander Downer’s decision to refuse Mr Chen asylum that was wrong, but the failure to offer him alternative protection. Instead, Mr Chen was advised of other visas (including a protection visa) he could apply for, but was told at the same time by a Foreign Affairs official that her minister had the power to veto a protection visa on foreign policy grounds. Given that that same minister had just declined a request for political asylum, presumably on foreign policy grounds, Mr Chen could have been forgiven for assuming that Downer would object to the granting of any visa for the same reason. If Minister Downer had instead sought to assure Mr Chen that the Australian government would not jeopardise his safety, the minister may have avoided some of the diplomatic fall-out that this case and the ensuing publicity have undoubtedly generated (and of which he seemed to be afraid when refusing Mr Chen’s initial request). Would it perhaps be better to have only one process, controlled by the Minister for Immigration and her department, who, after all, have ample experience in dealing with asylum seekers? Australia would do well to retain a dual system, if the granting of asylum were understood as an unbureaucratic means to offer protection to people in particularly precarious circumstances. It would because there may be situations when Australia’s national interest is better served by the swift and unbureaucratic granting of asylum (or the swift and unbureaucratic granting of permanent residence, as happened with some previous applications for political asylum), than by the issuing of a protection visa. Today it would also because the human rights of asylum seekers are often ill served by the Immigration Department’s narrow interpretation of the terms of the 1951 Refugees Convention. • Klaus Neumann is a senior research fellow at the Swinburne Institute for Social Research.
