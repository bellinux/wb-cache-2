25|$|In 1974 {{the badge}} was {{redesigned}} on Gianni Agnelli's request; it {{went back to}} a modernised silver, white and blue version of the 1929 design. Flag and lance were unified in a single shape and dispensed with the earlier minute detailing, the Lancia letters became all of the same size, and the steering wheel became also outlined in blue and lost the <b>hand</b> <b>throttle</b> detail. This logo debuted on the 1979 Lancia Delta, and made its way on the other models as they adopted the split grille introduced by the Delta. Though lightly revised in 2000 {{with the addition of}} a chrome shield surround, the 1974 logo was used through four decades, up to 2006.|$|E
2500|$|In 1910 Vincenzo Lancia asked Biscaretti di Ruffia {{to design}} a badge for the company; the Count {{submitted}} six watercolour proposal sketches. Vincenzo Lancia chose a round one, composed by a blue lance and flag bearing a Lancia script ("Lancia" [...] means [...] "lance" [...] in Italian) in gold, over a four-spoke steering wheel, with a <b>hand</b> <b>throttle</b> detail on the right spoke. The first car to bear the Lancia logo was the Gamma 20 HP in 1911.|$|E
2500|$|Rossy {{claims to}} be [...] "the first person to gain {{altitude}} and maintain a stable horizontal flight thanks to aerodynamic carbon foldable wings", which are folded by hinges at their midpoint. After being lifted to altitude by a plane, he ignites the engines just before he exits the plane with the wings folded. The wings unfold while in free-fall, and he then can fly horizontally for several minutes, landing {{with the help of}} a parachute. He achieves true controlled flight using his body and a <b>hand</b> <b>throttle</b> to maneuver; jet wingsuits use small turbojets, but differ from other aircraft in that the fuselage and flight control surfaces consist of a human.|$|E
50|$|Like motorcycles, Morgans had <b>hand</b> <b>throttles,</b> Bowden-wire control mechanisms, and drip lubrication.|$|R
25|$|The Mirage 2000 is {{available}} as a single-seat or two-seat multi-role fighter. The pilot flies the aircraft {{by means of a}} centre stick and left <b>hand</b> <b>throttles,</b> with both incorporating hands-on-throttle-and-stick (HOTAS) controls. The pilot sits on a SEM MB Mk10 zero-zero ejection seat (a license-built version of the British Martin-Baker Mark 10).|$|R
50|$|The wrestler {{grabs his}} opponent's throat with both <b>hands</b> and <b>throttles</b> him.|$|R
60|$|The {{sight of}} the river and the bridge he was nearing {{suggested}} a plan, and the ominous grating of the overheated motor warned him that whatever he was to do he must do at once. As he neared the bridge he reduced the speed of the car to fifteen miles an hour, and set the <b>hand</b> <b>throttle</b> to hold it there. Still gripping the steering wheel with one hand, he climbed over the left-hand door to the running board. As the front wheels of the car ran up onto the bridge Barney gave the steering wheel a sudden turn to the right, and jumped.|$|E
50|$|The engine <b>hand</b> <b>throttle</b> can {{is turned}} up {{to provide the}} proper {{rotational}} speed.|$|E

500|$|The pilot flies the {{aircraft}} {{by means of}} a centre stick and left <b>hand</b> <b>throttles.</b> The pilot sits on a Zvezda K-36 ejection seat (similar to the Sukhoi Su-27) and has standard flight instruments. At the rear of the cockpit is a [...] thick steel headrest, mounted on the rear bulkhead. The cockpit has a bathtub-shaped armoured enclosure of welded titanium sheets, with transit ports in the walls. Guide rails for the ejection seat are mounted on the rear wall of the cockpit.|$|R
60|$|I {{could see}} that if I took my eye off {{him for a moment}} he might spring at me, gas in <b>hand,</b> and <b>throttle</b> me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was--very glad indeed. But by what magic did you so {{suddenly}} subdue that man? And was {{it necessary to}} sully your <b>hands</b> by <b>throttling</b> him?" ...|$|R
50|$|The cockpit {{features}} a conventional centre stick and left <b>hand</b> <b>throttle</b> controls. The pilot {{sits in a}} Zvezda K-36DM ejection seat which has had impressive performance in emergency escapes.|$|E
50|$|All {{models were}} {{delivered}} {{from the factory}} with a <b>hand</b> <b>throttle.</b> Options available included a reserve parachute and electric starting. The line was noted for its unusually long three year warranty.|$|E
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} was {{designed in the}} 1980s to comply with German rules which are very stringent regarding safety and noise. It features a paraglider-style high-wing, single-place accommodation and a single [...] Solo 210 engine in pusher configuration, with a <b>hand</b> <b>throttle</b> control. As {{is the case with}} all paramotors, take-off and landing is accomplished by foot.|$|E
50|$|The pilot flies the {{aircraft}} {{by means of}} a centre stick and left <b>hand</b> <b>throttles.</b> The pilot sits on a Zvezda K-36 ejection seat (similar to the Sukhoi Su-27) and has standard flight instruments. At the rear of the cockpit is a 6 mm thick steel headrest, mounted on the rear bulkhead. The cockpit has a bathtub-shaped armoured enclosure of welded titanium sheets, with transit ports in the walls. Guide rails for the ejection seat are mounted on the rear wall of the cockpit.|$|R
25|$|User {{needs were}} given a high {{priority}} in the cockpit's design; both layout and functionality was created through feedback and assessments from military pilots and a specialist testing facility. The aircraft is controlled {{by means of a}} centre stick (or control stick) and left <b>hand</b> <b>throttles,</b> designed on a <b>Hand</b> on <b>Throttle</b> and Stick (HOTAS) principle to lower pilot workloads. Emergency escape is provided by a Martin-Baker Mk.16A ejection seat, with the canopy being jettisoned by two rocket motors. The HMSS was delayed by years but should have been operational by late 2011. Standard g-force protection is provided by the full-cover anti-g trousers (FCAGTs). a specially developed g suit providing sustained protection up to 9 g. German Air Force and Austrian Air Force pilots wear a hydrostatic g-suit called Libelle (dragonfly) Multi G Plus instead, which also provides protection to the arms, theoretically giving more complete g tolerance.|$|R
50|$|Some {{portable}} GCS {{units are}} in the HOTAS (<b>Hands</b> On <b>Throttle</b> And Stick) layout. This layout includes a 3-Axis Joystick to control yaw, pitch and roll of the UAV. A slide or t-bar fader can increase or decrease the airspeed of the UAV.|$|R
5000|$|Operating the T {{engine was}} not {{difficult}} after some experience, although {{the learning curve}} was longer than today's. The various manual control tasks (such as manual choke and spark advance) and the method of use (such as <b>hand</b> <b>throttle)</b> were typical for automobiles of the era, although they might seem more like farm tractor operation to most automobile drivers of today.|$|E
50|$|The Uno III has two configurations, as a dicycle {{and as a}} tricycle. As a dicycle it {{operates}} {{much the same as}} the original Uno with forward and back motion of the rider affecting acceleration. The Uno III also utilizes a <b>hand</b> <b>throttle</b> to affect acceleration and braking. Instead of using rider side-to-side movement to control steering, the Uno III uses a rotating handlebar.|$|E
50|$|The {{dashboard}} instrumentation includes speedometer with odometer, {{revolution counter}} and gauges showing oil pressure, fuel, cooling water temperature, air pressure of both circuits and ammeter. There are lamps for oil pressure, indicators, alternator charging, differential interlock engagement, air pressure system warning, parking brake engagement and engine overheating indicator, and switches for headlights, heater and ventilation, windscreen wipers, indicators, differential interlock, <b>hand</b> <b>throttle</b> and engine shutdown; the models with tandem axle are also equipped with tandem lifting and lowering switches.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} is a two-seater {{with the}} rear seat occupant controlling the radar. Although cockpit controls are duplicated across cockpits, it is normal for the aircraft to be flown only from the front seat. The pilot flies the aircraft {{by means of a}} centre stick and left <b>hand</b> <b>throttles.</b> The rear cockpit has only two small vision ports {{on the sides of the}} canopy. The presence of the WSO (weapon systems operator) in the rear cockpit improves aircraft effectiveness since the WSO is entirely dedicated to radar operations and weapons deployment, thus decreasing the workload of the pilot and increasing efficiency. Both cockpits are fitted with zero/zero ejection seats which allow the crew to eject at any altitude and airspeed.|$|R
50|$|T-6B Texan II : Upgraded {{version of}} the T-6A with a digital glass cockpit that {{includes}} a Head-Up Display (HUD), six multi-function displays (MFD) and <b>Hands</b> on <b>Throttle</b> And Stick (HOTAS), used at Naval Air Station Whiting Field, Naval Air Station Corpus Christi, and United States Naval Test Pilot School.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait till we {{have got}} her warmed up," [...] said the man, who stood quietly intent, his lean <b>hand</b> on the <b>throttle.</b> [...] "Then you'll see something." ...|$|R
5000|$|In the {{earliest}} models, {{power from the}} engine (which was mounted in front, started by rope, and operated with a <b>hand</b> <b>throttle)</b> was transferred by a long drive belt to a simple lever-operated forward/reverse transmission between the rear wheels. This transmission was under the bench seat, and drove power to serrated, cast iron [...] "gears" [...] which drove the wheels through contact friction atop the 2.25x10 semi-pneumatic tire treads. Braking action was accomplished by reversing the transmission.|$|E
50|$|The pedal furthest to {{the right}} is the foot throttle. Unlike in automobiles, {{it can also be}} {{controlled}} from a hand-operated lever ("hand throttle"). This helps provide a constant speed in field work. It also helps provide continuous power for stationary tractors that are operating an implement by shaft or belt. The foot throttle gives the operator more automobile-like control over the speed of the tractor for road work. This is a feature of more recent tractors; older tractors often did not have it. In the UK, foot pedal use to control engine speed while travelling on the road is mandatory. Some tractors, especially those designed for row-crop work, have a 'de-accelerator' pedal, which operates in the reverse fashion to an automobile throttle, in that the pedal is pushed down to slow the engine. This allows fine control over the speed of the tractor when maneuvering at the end of crop rows in fields- the operating speed of the engine is set using the <b>hand</b> <b>throttle,</b> and to slow the tractor to turn, the operator simply has to press the pedal, and turn and release it once the turn is completed, rather than having to alter the setting of the <b>hand</b> <b>throttle</b> twice during the maneuver.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} Lancia logo {{was designed}} by Count Carlo Biscaretti di Ruffia.In 1910 Vincenzo Lancia asked Biscaretti di Ruffia to design a badge for the company; the Count submitted six watercolour proposal sketches.

5000|$|Larger {{military}} UAVs {{such as the}} General Atomics MQ-1 Predator feature what {{resembles a}} [...] "virtual cockpit". The pilot or sensor operator {{sits in front of}} a number of screens showing the view from the UAV, a map screen and aircraft instrumentation. Control is through a conventional aircraft-style joystick and <b>throttle,</b> possibly with <b>Hands</b> on <b>Throttle</b> and Stick (HOTAS) functionality.|$|R

50|$|The {{driver was}} {{seated on a}} Brooks bicycle saddle, which in {{recognition}} of the lack of vehicle suspension, was carried {{on the end of a}} cantilevered bar that acted as a leaf spring. A wide handlebar on the engine group was used for steering. A squeeze bar the width of this handlebar engaged the clutch. Controls included a <b>hand</b> <b>throttle,</b> a gear lever with two forward and one reverse gears, and a large handbrake lever. The engine unit rotated freely for a full 360° rotation. When used in reverse, the Auto-Truck could either be driven from the saddle, looking backwards over the driver's shoulder; or they could dismount, swivel the engine unit around and control it as a pedestrian-controlled truck from behind.|$|E
2500|$|Military trainer version. Powered by a [...] Continental IO-240-B engine. Instruments {{moved in}} front of the right seat, where the student sits, which places the stick in the student's right <b>hand</b> and <b>throttle</b> in the left, in a similar {{arrangement}} to fighter aircraft. Also equipped with a smaller fuel tank. Some Embry-Riddle Falcons have been sold to private owners and flight schools after being fitted with standard instrument panels and fuel tanks.|$|R
2500|$|The CR.100 is a {{conventional}} single engine, low-wing monoplane, {{with the large}} control surface areas and absence of dihedral expected in an aerobatic aircraft. [...] The structure is mostly wood and fabric, though the main wing spar is a plywood and carbon laminate composite and carbon covered ply is an option for the wing surfaces. All the flying surfaces are straight edged and tapered. [...] The ailerons take up about 60% of the wing's trailing edge. The ailerons have spades to reduce control loads. The remainder of the wing trailing edge is three-position flaps. The rudder and elevators are horn balanced {{and there is a}} fixed rudder trim tab. The width of the flat sided fuselage is determined by the side by side seating arrangement. Full dual controls, including a pair of left <b>hand</b> <b>throttles,</b> are fitted. [...] A sliding bubble canopy covers the cockpit and is faired behind into a raised and rounded fuselage top decking. [...] The wide track main conventional undercarriage has cantilever legs in fairings, with wheels usually in spats. The tailwheel is freely castoring. The CR.100T variant offers the alternative of a tricycle undercarriage.|$|R
50|$|Modifications {{were later}} {{made to the}} cockpits of both LLRV’s to better {{simulate}} the actual Lunar Module. These included {{the addition of the}} LM’s three-axis <b>hand</b> controller and <b>throttle.</b> A Styrofoam cockpit enclosure was also added to simulate the pilot’s restricted view in the LM.|$|R
