40|$|A {{new method}} for potable water {{treatment}} was brought forward and studied in this research. The treatment process was named as counterflow co-flocculation flotation (CC-FF). Pilot experiment was conducted and the operational parameters were presented. The optimized operational conditions are as follows: the detention time is 6 - 11 min with hydraulic load of 9 - 16 m(3) /(m(2) h); the recycle ratio {{should be no}} less than 8 % while {{the distance between the}} inlet of source water and recycle water should be greater than 1200 mm. If the source water turbidity was lower than 100 NTU, 0. 12 - 0. 35 mmol/L Al dosage is enough to maintain efficient turbidity removal. Since the flocculation and flotation. processes were carried out in the same tank, this new technique has some advantages than the conventional flocculation-flotation methods. Firstly, the microbubbles released from recycle water will participate in the flocculation of suspended particles, hence the low-density but high shear-force-resistance <b>flocci</b> could be formed. Secondly, the microflocci or suspended particles will be functioned as,nucleus' during the bubble formation from air-dissolved recycle water. Thirdly, in the midsection of the tank a blanket of bubble-microfloc aggregates could be formed, which will intercept the downward-flow <b>flocci</b> and upward-flow bubbles efficiently, thus keep the renovation and stability of the blanket. ...|$|R

They have a covering of fine brown to orange hairs, which is denser on the thorax, with face being the same colour. There is a fine covering of shorter hairs on the abdomen and the hind tibia is dark. Northern populations of A. scotica {{tend to be more}} extensively dark-haired than the southern populations. The smaller males have a wholly black abdomen too. There is an apical tooth on the mandibles but the cheeks normally lack a spine. As well as being smaller than the females they are also comparatively slender. A. scotica measures between 10 and 14mm in length.|$|R
500|$|This {{species was}} first {{described}} [...] as Cantherellus floccosus in 1834 by American mycologist Lewis David de Schweinitz, who reported it growing in beech woods in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania. Its specific epithet {{is derived from}} the Latin <b>floccus,</b> meaning [...] "tuft, or flock, of wool". In 1839, Miles Joseph Berkeley named a specimen from Canada as Cantharellus canadensis based on a manuscript by Johann Friedrich Klotzsch, noting its affinity to C. clavatus. A large specimen collected in Maine by Charles James Sprague was described as Cantharellus princeps in 1859 by Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis. In 1891, German botanist Otto Kuntze renamed Cantharellus canadensis as Trombetta canadensis, and C. floccosus as Merulius floccosus.|$|E
2500|$|These {{species are}} subdivisions of genus types {{that occur in}} partly {{unstable}} air. The species castellanus appears when a mostly stable stratocumuliform or cirriform layer becomes disturbed by localized areas of airmass instability, usually {{in the morning or}} afternoon. This results in the formation of cumuliform buildups arising from a common stratiform base. Castellanus resembles the turrets of a castle when viewed from the side, and can be found with stratocumuliform genera at any tropospheric altitude level and with limited-convective patches of high-level cirrus. Tufted clouds of the more detached <b>floccus</b> species are subdivisions of genus-types which may be cirriform or stratocumuliform in overall structure. They are sometimes seen with cirrus, and with tufted cirrocumulus, altocumulus, and stratocumulus. [...] Low and mid level castellanus or <b>floccus</b> can resemble cumulo- and cumulonimbogenitus formations (see 'Mother clouds' section). [...] However, the latter genitus types are seen mostly in the evening and are the result of cumuliform and cumulonimbiform clouds dissipating rather than forming or building.|$|E
2500|$|These {{are mostly}} fibrous wisps of {{delicate}} white cirriform ice crystal cloud that show up clearly {{against the blue}} sky. Cirrus are generally non-convective except castellanus and <b>floccus</b> subtypes which show limited convection.

5000|$|The cap is 3 - 10 cm in diameter, {{initially}} convex before flattening out somewhat. The margin is rolled inward, and viscid, cuticle {{which is}} often slightly spotted, smooth and with small fugacious viscid concolorous <b>flocci.</b> The color varies from dirty brownish or brownish-rust to ocher or grayish bluish in the center. The margin is fibrillose (covered with roughly parallel threadlike filaments), then smooth, with a violet or reddish-violet to grayish-brown tinge, then concolorous with {{the center of the}} cap. The gills are thin and crowded closely together, broadly emarginate (notched), dark violet when young, with edges often slightly denticulate (finely toothed). The tinge and intensity of the violet coloring {{is similar to that of}} the wood blewitt (Rhodopaxillus nudus). The stem is solid, vivid violet paling to violet purple or violet brown, with a distinctly marginate bulb 3 - 4 cm wide, otherwise almost cylindrical towards the base. The [...] (a cobweb-like partial veil consisting of silky fibrils) is violet. The flesh is violet lilac or violet, paling slightly when mature, and with a weak, unpleasant smell and mild taste. When cut or broken it turns purple, like the gills. It is an edible mushroom of medium quality.|$|R
2500|$|Another variety, {{duplicatus}} (closely spaced {{layers of}} the same type, one above the other), is sometimes found with cirrus of both the fibratus and uncinus species, and with altocumulus and stratocumulus of the species stratiformis and lenticularis. [...] The variety undulatus (having a wavy undulating base) can occur with any clouds of the species stratiformis or lenticularis, and with altostratus. [...] It is only rarely observed with stratus nebulosus. The variety lacunosus is caused by localized downdrafts that create circular holes {{in the form of}} a honeycomb or net.

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the spring season, the females start digging through their underground cells to collect pollen and nectar. The pollen that is collected is on the hind tibia, a large pollen-carrying brush, the hind femora, basket-like structure, and the trochanter, another basket called the <b>floccus.</b> The nectar is carried internally. Nectar load is increased in the afternoon but the amount of pollen per day does not change significantly.|$|E
50|$|Varieties: This genus type {{is always}} {{translucent}} {{and so has}} no opacity-based varieties. However, like cirrus, certain cirrocumulus species can sometimes be divided into pattern-based varieties. The undulatus variety has a wavy undulating base and is seen mostly with the stratiformis and lenticularis species types. The lacunosus variety contains circular holes caused by downdrafts in the cloud and is associated mainly with the species stratiformis, castellanus and <b>floccus.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Pattern-based varieties: Radiatus (arranged in {{parallel}} bands) is sometimes {{seen with the}} stratformis and castellanus species. Altocumulus stratiformis radiatus of any opacity is coded CM5 if it is increasing in amount. The duplicatus or undulatus varieties are occasionally seen with the stratiformis and lenticularis species. [...] Altocumulus stratiformis duplicatus is coded CM7 {{if it is not}} overridden by another coding of higher importance. Lacunosus is very occasionally associated with altocumulus of the species stratiformis, castellanus, or <b>floccus.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Species: Cirrocumulus {{stratiformis}} (Cc str) {{is one of}} four {{species and}} appears in the form of relatively flat stratocumuliform sheets or patches. The species lenticularis (Cc len) takes its name from the lens-shaped structure of this cloud which is tapered at each end. Cirrocumulus castellanus (Cc cas) has cumuliform buildups that give the cloud a partly or mainly turreted appearance. When the cumuliform parts have more of a tufted appearance, it is given the species name <b>floccus</b> (Cc flo). [...] Cirrocumulus with castellanus buildups can show some vertical extent, but are not usually classified as vertical or multi-Ã©tage clouds.|$|E

The full technical name of a cloud in this configuration would be altocumulus stratiformis radiatus perlucidus, which would identify respectively its genus, species, and two combined varieties.|$|E
5000|$|Species: Altocumulus {{has four}} species. The {{stratiformis}} species (Ac str) {{is composed of}} sheets or relatively flat patches of stratocumuliform cloud. The synoptic coding {{is determined by the}} predominant variety or occasionally by the genitus mother cloud. Altocumulus lenticularis (Ac len lenticular cloud) is a lens-shaped middle cloud which can resemble flying saucers and may occasionally be mistaken for [...] "unidentified flying objects". This is formed by uplift usually associated with mountains. but usually with at least some grey shading. It is coded CM4 on the SYNOP weather observation. Grey shading is also seen with altocumulus castellanus (Ac cas), a turreted middle cloud that can achieve significant vertical development and signals increasing airmass instability. It is nevertheless usually classified as middle rather than vertical and is coded CM8. The <b>floccus</b> species (Ac flo) is a tufted middle cloud which is also associated with greater instability. It shares the same code CM8. Chaotic altocumulus, which is typically poorly defined with multiple species or transitional forms arranged in several layers, is coded CM9.|$|E
5000|$|Moreover, the International Cloud Atlas (ICA) is {{not entirely}} precise {{regarding}} how to determine the genus of a convective cloud. Per the ICA (1975, p. 15-16), {{the base of a}} cumulus cloud is usually between the surface and 2 km. This height limit originates from observations in temperate climates where the surface temperature and humidity are about average. It {{does not take into account}} how the cloud is formed. In the American West, the base of cumulus clouds can reach 4000 m, since the combination of a low dew point (10 C) and high temperature (up to 45 C) will yield a very high convective condensation level. While the ICA allows that a cumulus cloud can have a base higher than 2 km (by saying that cumulus clouds usually have their bases at or below this height), guidance given on page 16 of the ICA could lead to misclassification of a high cumulus cloud. This guidance says that a cloud's genus can be determined [...] "by making a choice from among the genera normally encountered in the etage (height range) corresponding to its height." [...] This could lead the observer to rule out cumulus as a possible genus for a cloud that has all the ICA-described characteristics of a cumulus except that its base is above the [...] "Low" [...] etage (surface to 2 km). The observer, conscientiously trying to comply with ICA classification guidance, might then misclassify this cloud as an altocumulus (perhaps altocumulus <b>floccus),</b> although the instability creating it is at a different level compared to an altocumulus.|$|E
