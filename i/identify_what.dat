5|$|With William dead, the {{succession}} to the English throne {{was thrown into}} doubt. Rules of succession were uncertain in western Europe at the time; {{in some parts of}} France, male primogeniture was becoming more popular, in which the eldest son would inherit a title. It was also traditional for the King of France to crown his successor while he was still alive, making the intended line of succession relatively clear. This was not the case in England, where the best a noble could do was to <b>identify</b> <b>what</b> Professor Eleanor Searle has termed a pool of legitimate heirs, leaving them to challenge and dispute the inheritance after his death. The problem was further complicated by the sequence of unstable Anglo-Norman successions over the previous sixty years. William the Conqueror had invaded England, his sons William Rufus and Robert Curthose had fought a war between them to establish their inheritance, and Henry had only acquired control of Normandy by force. There had been no peaceful, uncontested successions.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} models for testing {{artificial}} intelligence {{have been noted}} by philosophers as being relevant to the themes present in Scott's filmography. The test most commonly associated with artificial intelligence in his work is the Turing test, created by the English computer scientist Alan Turing. Turing's argument was {{that there is no}} significant difference between a human and an android, which would be apparent when a human would be unable to identify if the individual they are communicating with is a human or android. In Blade Runner, the method for identifying the physically identical replicants is by administering the fictional Voight-Kampff test, which detects disparities in emotional responses. Though a replicant would fail the Turing test, an android at the chronological marker of Alien, such as Ash, would likely perform exceedingly well. Additionally, the Chinese room, created by John Searle, has been postured as a test relevant to the androids of the Alien franchise. As the test determines if someone can <b>identify</b> <b>what</b> is Chinese lettering without knowing what it means, philosophers have drawn a parallel to Ash, who may uncannily emulate a human, though fail to understand {{what it means to be}} one. Kang described David's eventual introduction as another android character created by Scott as a synthesis between both Alien and Blade Runner, with the character being capable of passing the Turing test like Ash, yet also able to pass the Chinese room test like a replicant, implying that he would indeed be the first living android of the Alien franchise.|$|E

25|$|Promoting {{intrinsic}} motivation {{and problem solving}} are two areas where educators can foster creativity in students. Students are more creative {{when they see a}} task as intrinsically motivating, valued for its own sake. To promote creative thinking, educators need to <b>identify</b> <b>what</b> motivates their students and structure teaching around it. Providing students with a choice of activities to complete allows them to become more intrinsically motivated and therefore creative in completing the tasks.|$|E

25|$|To {{understand}} the Logical Form of these examples, {{it is important}} to <b>identify</b> <b>what</b> the basic predicate is and which segments make up the QNPs. In these examples, the predicate is tall and the QNPs are a girl, many girls, every girl and no girl. The logical meaning of these sentences indicates that the property of being tall is attributed to some form of the QNP referring to girl. Along with the QNP and the predicate, there is also an inference of truth value. Either the truth value is True for a person who is tall, otherwise the truth value is False.|$|E
25|$|The {{policies}} for language revitalization have been changing {{in attempts to}} improve Maori language use and {{have been working with}} suggestions from the Waitangi Tribunal on the best ways to implement the revitalization. The Waitangi Tribunal in 2011 identified a suggestion for language revitalization that would shift indigenous policies from the central government to the preferences and ideologies of the Māori people. This change recognizes the issue of Te Reo revitalization as one of indigenous self-determination, instead of the job of the government to <b>identify</b> <b>what</b> would be best for the language and Maori people of New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|This is {{a series}} of vignettes recounting a social {{occasion}} during which someone said something that should not have been said, or an awkward occurrence. The participant's task is to <b>identify</b> <b>what</b> was said that was awkward, why it was awkward, how people would have felt in reaction to the faux pas and to a factual control question. Although first designed for use in people on the autism spectrum, the test is also sensitive to patients with OFC dysfunction, who cannot judge when something socially awkward has happened despite appearing to understand the story perfectly well.|$|E

25|$|The theory {{holds that}} the stages {{are a part of}} the {{framework}} that helps people learn to live without what they lost. Lay people and practitioners consider the stages as tools to help frame and <b>identify</b> <b>what</b> a person who's suffered a loss may be feeling. The theory {{holds that the}} stages are not stops on a linear time line of grief. The theory also states that not everyone goes through all of the stages, nor in a prescribed order. In addition to the five-stages theory, Kübler-Ross has been credited with bringing mainstream awareness to the sensitivity required for better treatment of people who are dealing with a fatal disease.|$|E
25|$|One {{approach}} to resolving this problem {{relies on the}} fact that a living body is constantly losing old matter and gaining new matter. A five-year-old body consists of different matter than does the same person's seventy-year-old body. If the five-year-old body and the seventy-year-old body consist of different matter, then what makes them the same body? The answer is presumably the soul. Because the five-year-old body and the seventy-year-old body share a soul—that is, the person's life—we can identify them both as the body. Apart from the soul, we cannot <b>identify</b> <b>what</b> collection of matter is the body. Therefore, a person's body is no longer that person's body after it dies.|$|E
25|$|More recently, {{research}} has engaged three further directions – the speculation {{that at least}} some animals seem to enjoy a zoophilic relationship assuming sadism is not present, and can form an affectionate bond. Similar findings are also reported by Kinsey (cited by Masters), and others earlier in history. Miletski (1999) notes that information on sex with animals on the internet is often very emphatic as to what the zoophile believes gives pleasure and how to <b>identify</b> <b>what</b> is perceived as consent beforehand. For instance, Jonathan Balcombe says animals do things for pleasure. But he himself says pet owners will be unimpressed by this statement, as this is not news to them.|$|E
