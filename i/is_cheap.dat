5|$|A popular food in Gangtok is the momo, a steamed {{dumpling}} containing pork, {{beef and}} vegetables cooked in a doughy wrapping {{and served with}} watery soup. Wai-Wai is a packaged snack consisting of noodles which are eaten either dry or in soup form. A form of noodle called thukpa, served in soup form is also popular in Gangtok. Other noodle-based foods such as the chowmein, thenthuk, fakthu, gyathuk and wonton are available. Other traditional Sikkimese cuisine include shah-phaley (Sikkimese patties with spiced minced meat in a crisp samosa-like case) and Gack-ko soup. Restaurants offer {{a wide variety of}} traditional Indian, continental and Chinese cuisines to cater to the tourists. Churpee, a kind of hard cheese made from cow's or yak's milk is sometimes chewed. Chhang is a local frothy millet beer traditionally served in bamboo tankards and drunk through bamboo or cane straws. Alcohol <b>is</b> <b>cheap</b> due to low excise duty in Sikkim. Beer, whiskey, rum and brandy are frequently consumed by both locals and non-locals.|$|E

The first Winos' record, Talk <b>Is</b> <b>Cheap,</b> also featured Bernie Worrell, Bootsy Collins and Maceo Parker. Since its release, Talk <b>Is</b> <b>Cheap</b> has gone gold and has sold consistently. Its release {{was followed by the}} first of the two US tours Richards has done as a solo artist. Live at the Hollywood Palladium, 15 December 1988 documents the first of these tours. In 1992 the Winos' second studio record Main Offender was released, and was also followed by a tour. Although the Winos featured on both albums, they were credited to Richards as a solo artist.|$|E
25|$|Typical light {{refreshments}} include cake, cookies, popcorn, pretzels, {{nuts and}} seeds, soft drinks, and beer. In addition, chickpeas are customarily served {{because they are}} a round-shaped food eaten by mourners (as they symbolize the cyclical nature of life).

25|$|Although {{morphine}} <b>is</b> <b>cheap,</b> {{people in}} poorer countries {{often do not}} have access to it. According to a 2005 estimate by the International Narcotics Control Board, six countries (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States) consume 79% of the world’s morphine. The less affluent countries, accounting for 80% of the world's population, consumed only about 6% of the global morphine supply. Some countries import virtually no morphine, and in others the drug is rarely available even for relieving severe pain while dying.|$|E
25|$|The helium is {{included}} {{as a substitute for}} some of the nitrogen, to reduce the narcotic effect of the breathing gas at depth. With a mixture of three gases it is possible to create mixes suitable for different depths or purposes by adjusting the proportions of each gas. Oxygen content can be optimised for the depth to limit the risk of toxicity, and the inert component balanced between nitrogen (which <b>is</b> <b>cheap</b> but narcotic) and helium (which is not narcotic and reduces work of breathing, but is more expensive and increases heat loss).|$|E
25|$|According to Dr Robbie McDonald, Head of Wildlife and Emerging Diseases at FERA (the lead {{wildlife}} {{scientist for}} Defra and responsible {{for research on}} badgers) the benefit of culling a population is outweighed by the detrimental effect on neighbouring populations of badgers. He is reported as saying that {{a huge number of}} badgers would have to be killed to make a difference and while it <b>is</b> <b>cheap</b> and easy to exterminate animals {{in the early days of}} a cull it gets harder and more expensive as time goes on.|$|E

25|$|The {{mathematical}} modelling of flocking behaviour {{is a common}} technology, and has found uses in animation. Flocking simulations {{have been used in}} many films to generate crowds which move realistically. Tim Burton's Batman Returns was the first movie to make use of swarm technology for rendering, realistically depicting the movements of a group of bats using the boids system. The Lord of the Rings film trilogy made use of similar technology, known as massive, during battle scenes. Swarm technology is particularly attractive because it <b>is</b> <b>cheap,</b> robust, and simple.|$|E
25|$|Slaves {{can be an}} {{attractive}} investment because the slave-owner only needs to pay for sustenance and enforcement. This is sometimes lower than the wage-cost of free labourers, because free workers earn more than sustenance, in these cases slaves have positive price. When the cost of sustenance and enforcement exceeds the wage rate, slave-owning {{would no longer be}} profitable, and owners would simply release their slaves. Slaves are thus a more attractive investment in high-wage environments, and environments where enforcement <b>is</b> <b>cheap,</b> and less attractive in environments where the wage-rate is low and enforcement is expensive.|$|E
25|$|The {{open circuit}} demand system {{exhausts}} gas {{to the environment}} at ambient pressure (or a very small difference from ambient pressure required to open the exhaust valve). As a result, all exhaled gas is lost to the surroundings. For most surface orientated commercial diving where air is the breathing gas in use, this is no problem, as air <b>is</b> <b>cheap</b> and freely available. Even with nitrox it is generally more cost effective to use open circuit, as oxygen is an easily available and relatively inexpensive gas, and blending nitrox is technologically simple, both to mix and to analyse.|$|E

25|$|A Thomas Reuters Foundation survey {{says that}} India {{is the fourth}} most {{dangerous}} {{place in the world}} for women to live in. Women belonging to any class, caste, creed or religion can be victims of this cruel form of violence and disfigurement, a premeditated crime intended to kill or maim permanently and act as a lesson to put a woman in her place. In India, acid attacks on women who dared to refuse a man's proposal of marriage or asked for a divorce are a form of revenge. Acid <b>is</b> <b>cheap,</b> easily available, and the quickest way to destroy a woman's life. The number of acid attacks have been rising.|$|E
25|$|An {{article in}} the Weekly Standard, an American {{conservative}} opinion magazine, questioned the cost-effectiveness of Habitat building projects. To estimate cost effectiveness, all costs associated with building a Habitat home must be used, including the cost of volunteer time and training. For houses constructed by foreign volunteers, travel and associated costs paid by the volunteers are also significant. Including these costs raises the question whether building a house this way is an efficient use of resources. Particularly in developing countries where labor is relatively inexpensive, unemployment is high, and local currency <b>is</b> <b>cheap,</b> purchasing local labor and supplies may result {{in an increase in}} the number of houses built.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the craft}} has been waning {{and may be}} in danger of extinction. On Comonfort Street in Metepec {{there are dozens of}} pottery {{workshops}} but only two of these remain making the trees. One major reason for this <b>is</b> <b>cheap</b> imitations, mostly imported from Asia. This has been a problem for many Mexican crafts, with the federal government stepping in to develop trademarks and “denomination of origin” for traditional crafts. In 2009, the Tree of Life was trademarked for artisans from Metepec and neighboring Calimaya, befitting the approximately 300 families that dedicate themselves to making them. In addition to authenticity, there are plans to use the trademark to promote the product internationally.|$|E
