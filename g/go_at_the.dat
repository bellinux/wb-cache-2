Tina is excited, but Louise, who dislikes boy bands, only agrees to <b>go</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> insistence {{of her mother}} Linda (John Roberts). Gene has qualified for a regional tablescaping competition, which Bob (H. Jon Benjamin) and Linda escort him to. Louise rejoices after a pet emergency leaves Gayle unable to bring the sisters to the concert, but reluctantly agrees to help find another ride after seeing Tina's disappointment. They hitch a ride with Zeke (Bobby Tisdale) and his older cousin Leslie (Jack McBrayer), {{who are going to}} the concert to sell bootleg T-shirts and hot dogs. Bob and Linda later meet the arrogant father of a fellow competitor named Oscar Anthony, which drives them to push Gene to win.|$|E

Iyama became an insei in October 1998 and challenged for a professional spot in 2001. He lost to Kohei Kawada. The following year, he challenged again and passed the qualifying test. At the time, Iyama was the fourth youngest professional behind Cho Chikun, Utaro Hashimoto and Satoshi Yuki.|$|E

Also in 1979, KDKA covered the Three Mile Island nuclear accident, first reported by Harrisburg newsman Mike Pintek. By 1982, Pintek joined the KDKA News staff and later became one of the station's most popular talk hosts, although he was let <b>go</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of 2005 as part of a programming overhaul. In 2007, he became the host of Night Talk on the Pittsburgh Cable News Channel. As of January 2009, Pintek was rehired at KDKA to host a talk show in the 6pm to 10 pm timeslot, and, following the death of Fred Honsberger, took over the 12 PM-3 PM timeslot as of January 2010.|$|E

25|$|The {{change in}} {{subsidies}} {{is intended to}} be completed by 2011, but individual governments have some freedom to decide how the new scheme will be introduced. The UK government has decided to run a dual system of subsidies in England, each year transferring a larger proportion of the total payment to the new scheme. Payments under the old scheme were frozen at their levels averaged over 2002–2003 and reduce each subsequent year. This allows farmers in England a period where their income is maintained, but which they can use to change farm practices to accord with the new regime. Other governments have chosen to wait, and change the system in one <b>go</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> latest possible time. Governments also have limited discretion to continue to direct a small proportion of the total subsidy to support specific crops. Alterations to the qualifying rules meant that many small landowners became eligible to apply for grants and the Rural Payments Agency in England received double the previous number of applications (110,000).|$|E
25|$|After {{returning}} from racing in Europe in 1997, Nadeau {{moved to the}} Winston Cup Series and signed a five-race contract with Precision Products Racing to replace Morgan Shepherd in the No. 1 Pontiac Grand Prix. During the first races, Nadeau was Shepherd's spotter, and worked on maintaining Shepherd's car before the races. Nadeau also built his own cars for Automobile Racing Club of America (ARCA) and Busch Series events. Nadeau made all five races, including a ninth-place qualification at New Hampshire International Speedway, but failed to finish higher than thirtieth and was let <b>go</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of his contract when the team's sponsor expressed no interest in retaining him. In five races, he had no Top Ten finishes, two Did Not Finishes (DNF) and finished fifty-fourth in season points. He also took part in one race in the Busch Series at Talladega Superspeedway but failed to qualify. He made his first appearance in an ARCA Bondo/Mar-Hyde Series (now ARCA Racing Series) car and finished fourth and second in the races he entered. Nadeau's performances during the season caught the interest of 1988 Champion Bill Elliott and quarterback Dan Marino, and they offered him the chance to become their second driver.|$|E

The announcement of the main construction contract signing caused Kingdom Holding Company's stock to jump 3.2% in one day, in addition to KHC already having reported a 21% rise in second-quarter net profit. Also, for the first time, architects Gordon Gill and Adrian Smith officially announced their involvement in the project.|$|E

500|$|Until {{well into}} the twentieth century the {{manufacture}} of brick in the Netherlands (and elsewhere) used manual labor mostly, and the low-paid workers involved in the industry were as marginal socially as the manufacturing industry geographically—the raw materials were gathered on river banks, and the firing of the bricks took place well away from towns and farms to lessen any nuisance caused by fire and smoke. Workers, as was noted in municipal reports, often already belonged to the lower levels of society and were frequently simply let <b>go</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the season, adding to the municipal burdens: [...] "As the number of brick kilns increases, so does poverty," [...] according to the 1873 report of the Ubbergen municipality, near Nijmegen, on the Waal river.|$|E
500|$|Leonardo first gained notoriety for {{his work}} on the Baptism of Christ, painted in {{conjunction}} with Verrocchio. Two other paintings appear to date from his time at Verrocchio's workshop, both of which are Annunciations. One is small, [...] long and [...] high. It is a [...] "predella" [...] to <b>go</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> base of a larger composition, a painting by Lorenzo di Credi from which it has become separated. The other is a much larger work, [...] long. In both Annunciations, Leonardo used a formal arrangement, like two well-known pictures by Fra Angelico of the same subject, of the Virgin Mary sitting or kneeling {{to the right of the}} picture, approached from the left by an angel in profile, with a rich flowing garment, raised wings and bearing a lily. Although previously attributed to Ghirlandaio, the larger work is now generally attributed to Leonardo.|$|E
500|$|Upon release, Dark Forces was {{commonly}} called a [...] "Doom clone," [...] {{but the game}} makes significant expansions upon the gameplay features present in Doom. New gameplay mechanisms that were not common {{at the time of}} release include the ability to look up and down, duck, jump, and swim. The use of multiple floor levels is another technical advance in the first-person shooter genre. To produce these new features, the developers wrote a game engine from scratch. The Jedi game engine can create gameplay and graphical elements such as fully 3D objects, atmospheric effects such as fog and haze, animated textures and shading. Stinnett indicated that the developers wanted these elements to be part of an [...] "active environment," [...] and features were included to create this: [...] "ships come and <b>go</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> flight decks, rivers sweep along, platforms and conveyor belts move and much of the machinery functions." ...|$|E
