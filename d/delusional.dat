5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, theories, which {{contained}} ideas about reforming society and struggling for truth, and religious convictions were not referred to <b>delusional</b> paranoid disorders in practically all foreign classifications, but Soviet psychiatry, proceeding from ideological conceptions, referred {{critique of the}} political system and proposals to reform this system to the <b>delusional</b> construct. Diagnostic approaches of conception of sluggish schizophrenia and paranoiac states with delusion of reformism were used only in the Soviet Union and several Eastern European countries.|$|E
5|$|An overvalued idea is a {{false belief}} that is held with {{conviction}} but not with <b>delusional</b> intensity. Hypochondriasis is an overvalued idea that one is suffering from an illness, dysmorphophobia is an overvalued idea that a part of one's body is abnormal, and people with anorexia nervosa may have an overvalued idea of being thin.|$|E
5|$|Behavioural and neuropsychiatric changes {{become more}} prevalent. Common manifestations are wandering, {{irritability}} and labile affect, leading to crying, outbursts of unpremeditated aggression, or resistance to caregiving. Sundowning can also appear. Approximately 30% {{of people with}} AD develop illusionary misidentifications and other <b>delusional</b> symptoms. Subjects also lose insight of their disease process and limitations (anosognosia). Urinary incontinence can develop. These symptoms create stress for relatives and carers, which can be reduced by moving the person from home care to other long-term care facilities.|$|E
5|$|In a {{study of}} 19th-century warfare, {{historian}} James Reid posits that Anderson suffered from <b>delusional</b> paranoia, which exacerbated his aggressive, sadistic personality. He sees Anderson as obsessed with, and greatly enjoying, the ability to inflict fear and suffering in his victims, and suggests he suffered from the most severe type of sadistic personality disorder. Reid draws a parallel between the bashi-bazouks and Anderson's group, arguing that they behaved similarly.|$|E
5|$|Lice were {{ubiquitous}} in human society {{until at least}} the Middle Ages. They appear in folktales, songs such as The Kilkenny Louse House, and novels such as James Joyce's Finnegans Wake. They commonly feature in the psychiatric disorder <b>delusional</b> parasitosis. A louse {{was one of the}} early subjects of microscopy, appearing in Robert Hooke's 1667 book, Micrographia.|$|E
5|$|Schizophrenia {{is often}} {{described}} in terms of positive and negative (or deficit) symptoms. Positive symptoms are those that most individuals do not normally experience, but are present in people with schizophrenia. They can include delusions, disordered thoughts and speech, and tactile, auditory, visual, olfactory and gustatory hallucinations, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis. Hallucinations are also typically related to the content of the <b>delusional</b> theme. Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication.|$|E
5|$|A liberal {{is someone}} who favors {{censorship}} of Christianity plus increased government spending and power, as in ObamaCare. Increasingly liberals side with the homosexual agenda, including same-sex marriage. Many liberals favor a welfare state where people receive endless entitlements without working. Liberals are often anti-Christian, or otherwise disagree with moral or social principles held by many American Christians. The liberal ideology has worsened {{over the years and}} degenerated into economically <b>delusional</b> views and intolerant ideology. Some liberals simply support, in knee-jerk fashion, the opposite of conservative principles without having any meaningful values of their own.|$|E
5|$|Changeling is a 2008 American mystery thriller film directed, co-produced {{and scored}} by Clint Eastwood and written by J. Michael Straczynski, that explores child endangerment, female disempowerment, {{political}} corruption, mistreatment {{of mental health}} patients, and the repercussions of violence. The script was based on real-life events, specifically the 1928 Wineville Chicken Coop Murders in Mira Loma, California. The film stars Angelina Jolie as a woman reunited with a boy whom she immediately realizes is not her missing son. When she tries to demonstrate this {{to the police and}} city authorities, she is vilified as <b>delusional,</b> labeled as an unfit mother, and then confined to a psychiatric ward.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Knauf {{felt that}} Brother Justin shares {{patterns}} with certain religious leaders who were often persecuted for their <b>delusional</b> visions. Historical figures like Father Coughlin, Aimee Semple McPherson and Brigham Young served as inspiration, although the writers refrained from re-telling their particular stories. Daniel Knauf originally thought of making Brother Justin a Protestant minister, {{but when the}} producers needed to decide on a specific religious affiliation, Knauf contested their plans {{to make him a}} Catholic priest. Knauf, a Catholic himself, settled on the Methodist denomination, which he perceived as significantly less clichéd, suspicious or controversial. When asked whether God had influenced him to write the story, Knauf replied no.|$|E
5|$|Kyle and Sarah are apprehended {{by police}} after another {{encounter}} with the Terminator. Criminal psychologist Dr. Silberman concludes that Kyle is paranoid and <b>delusional.</b> The Terminator repairs his body and attacks the police station, killing many police officers {{in his attempt to}} locate Sarah. Kyle and Sarah escape, steal another car and take refuge in a motel, where they assemble pipe bombs and plan their next move. Kyle admits that he has been in love with Sarah since John gave him a photograph of her, and they have sex.|$|E
5|$|Psychotic {{symptoms}} may {{be present}} in several other mental disorders, including bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, drug intoxication, and drug-induced psychosis. Delusions ("non-bizarre") are also present in <b>delusional</b> disorder, and social withdrawal in social anxiety disorder, avoidant personality disorder and schizotypal personality disorder. Schizotypal personality disorder has symptoms that are similar but less severe than those of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia occurs along with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) considerably more often than {{could be explained by}} chance, although {{it can be difficult to}} distinguish obsessions that occur in OCD from the delusions of schizophrenia. A few people withdrawing from benzodiazepines experience a severe withdrawal syndrome which may last a long time. It can resemble schizophrenia and be misdiagnosed as such.|$|E
5|$|Several months later, a {{metallic}} artifact with inscriptions is discovered {{on the beach}} of Côte d'Ivoire in Africa. After Mulder examines rubbings of the object, he begins suffering from a headache, seemingly caused by the rubbings. Mulder's condition worsens, but he gains telepathic abilities. Chuck Burks (Bill Dow) tells them that the symbols on the artifact are Navajo. Eventually, Mulder passes into an aggravated <b>delusional</b> state and is placed under observation at a hospital. Hoping to find an answer, Scully rushes to Africa and finds the massive wreck of a large spacecraft partially buried in the beach.|$|E
5|$|The episode's {{antagonistic}} bug {{creature was}} created {{by means of a}} prosthetic suit that was worn by a stuntwoman. The suit was highly ridiculed behind the scenes. To fix the perceived issues with the monster, the production team gave the film to visual effects editor Laurie Kallsen-George, who digitally altered the footage until it was deemed suitable. The episode's title is a reference to Folie à deux, a form of insanity shared by two people. It usually begins with one person who conceives of a <b>delusional</b> belief and then spreads it to another; thus, those two share the same delusion.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Mulder {{encounters}} a <b>delusional</b> man, Gary Lambert (Brian Markinson), who believes his boss, Greg Pincus (John Apicella), may be a monster—and decides to take an entire office building, including Mulder, hostage to prove it. Lambert is eventually killed, but somehow, Mulder inherits his ability to see Pincus as a monster. After Mulder claims that Pincus is a monster, he is locked in a psychiatric hospital, only to be saved by Scully: {{the only person who}} believes him.|$|E
5|$|Wadzeks Kampf mit der Dampfturbine (Wadzek's Struggle {{with the}} Steam Turbine) is a 1918 comic novel by the German author Alfred Döblin. Set in Berlin, it narrates the futile and often <b>delusional</b> {{struggle}} of the eponymous industrialist Wadzek against Rommel, his more powerful competitor. In its narrative technique and its refusal to psychologize its characters, {{as well as in}} its vivid evocations of Berlin as a modern metropolis, Wadzeks Kampf mit der Dampfturbine has been read as a precursor to Döblin's better-known 1929 novel Berlin Alexanderplatz.|$|E
5|$|As he {{nears the}} cabin, the {{imaginary}} Barry appears and tells Alan {{that he will}} have to reject all the illusions before he can face off against the insane version of Alan, including the apparition of Barry. Alan is ready to accept that, forcing Alan to fight Taken illusions of Dr. Hartman, Barry, and the Andersons, defeating them all before he is able to reenter the cabin. His crazed side is in a paranoid state on the cabin floor, and when Alan touches him, the two are made whole again. Alan realizes that he cannot let himself fall into a <b>delusional</b> state again for fear of never being able to escape, and returns to the typewriter to start a new story—"Return".|$|E
5|$|Norman Osborn {{is shown}} to be {{severely}} manic depressive. This has been referenced several times in a myriad of Spider-Man stories. When he is not {{under the direction of}} a psychiatrist and taking medication, he has dangerous mood swings. At the apex of his mania, he is paranoid, <b>delusional,</b> and suffers from visual and auditory hallucinations, including hearing the voice of his Green Goblin persona and seeing its face in the mirror rather than his own. Previously, Osborn's arrogance caused him to refuse to submit to psychiatric treatment unless forced to; he viewed mental illness as an imperfection and therefore would not admit that he is mentally ill. In later conversations with the Sentry, Osborn revealed that he had come to accept his own mental illness. After having rid of his powers after the confrontation with the Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus), Osborn's sanity apparently restored but remains a villain.|$|E
5|$|Summer Glau as River Tam– smuggled {{onto the}} ship by her brother. She {{is a highly}} intelligent, {{compassionate}} and intuitive child prodigy. Experiments and invasive brain surgery at an Alliance secret facility left her <b>delusional,</b> paranoid, and at times violent, though her uncanny ability to seemingly sense things before they happen leaves questions as to where the delusions end and reality begins for her. The experiments seemed to have made her a psychic. The experiments also gave her a seemingly innate ability in hand-to-hand combat, and she is capable of killing or incapacitating several opponents with ease. She gets frequent fits of anxiety and experiences post-traumatic flashbacks of her time in the Alliance facility. Her mental instability and uncanny abilities, paired with several erratic and violent acts, are a recurring source of fear and doubt among the crew, especially with Jayne, whom she once slashed with a knife. Jayne very frequently requests that River and Simon {{be taken off the}} ship.|$|E
5|$|With all the walkers subdued from Hershel Greene (Scott Wilson)'s barn, Hershel demands Rick (Andrew Lincoln) and {{his group}} leave the farm. Rick confronts Shane (Jon Bernthal) {{regarding}} his actions leading to this, but Shane considers Rick as <b>delusional</b> as Hershel. The group decides to bury the walker bodies of Hershel's wife and stepson as well as Carol (Melissa McBride)'s daughter Sophia, while burning {{the rest of the}} walkers. They hold a makeshift memorial service for Sophia, but Carol refuses to attend. She falls into a deep depression, going off into the woods to pull up flowers, including a Cherokee Rose that has been a sign of hope for her. Shane finds her and helps return her to the camp, apologizing to her that he had no idea Sophia was in the barn.|$|E
5|$|Döblin's 1918 comic novel {{has been}} seen, in its {{experimental}} narrative technique, {{its refusal to}} psychologize its characters, and its depictions of Berlin as modern metropolis, as a precursor to Döblin's better-known Berlin Alexanderplatz. Wadzeks Kampf mit der Dampfturbine (Wadzek's Battle with the Steam Turbine) {{tells the story of}} Wadzek, a factory owner locked in a losing battle with a more powerful competitor. His futile and increasingly <b>delusional</b> countermeasures culminate in the fortification and quixotic defense of his family's garden house in suburban Reinickendorf. Following the dissipation of this endeavor, he suffers a breakdown and finally flees the country, eloping aboard a steamship bound for America that is powered by the steam turbines of his victorious competitor. Döblin wrote the novel in the fall of 1914, submitting it to extensive stylistic revisions while serving as a doctor on the Western front; it was published in May 1918 by the Fischer Verlag. In its stringent refusal of a tragic tone, the book earned the praise of a young Bertolt Brecht.|$|E
5|$|As {{the novel}} opens, Wadzek, {{owner of a}} factory that {{produces}} steam engines, is locked in a struggle with his more powerful rival Rommel, whose much larger company manufactures turbines. He {{can be seen as}} representing a new type of entrepreneur, more technologically advanced and less scrupulous than Wadzek. Losing value, the stock of Wadzek's company is being bought up by Rommel; in desperation, Wadzek teams up with Schneemann, an engineer working at one of Rommel's factories, to thwart his company's takeover by Rommel. This effort includes the misguided theft of some of Rommel's business correspondence. Fearing legal retribution for this theft, Wadzek, accompanied by Schneemann, flees with his wife Pauline and daughter Herta to his house in Reinickendorf, where the two men fortify the house in <b>delusional</b> preparation for a siege that never comes. Financially and spiritually broken, Wadzek returns to Berlin and with Schneemann attempts to turn himself in at a police station, where they learn that no warrant has even been issued for their arrest. There follows a temporary reconciliation with his estranged family and the first attempts to begin a new career in education—Wadzek would instruct his students in a new, moralistic and humane approach to technology. However, after walking in on an erotically and exotically charged debauch held in his own parlor (the aftermath of an African-themed birthday party Pauline held with her two new friends from Reinickendorf), Wadzek suffers a further breakdown. The novel ends aboard a ship bound for America, Wadzek eloping with Gaby, an old acquaintance and erstwhile lover of Rommel's, to begin a new life.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere in town, {{a trio of}} {{teenagers}} drink beer and huff fumes generated from heated manure. One of them sees a roach crawl into an open wound on his wrist, and {{in an attempt to}} extricate the insect, he begins to frantically slice his skin with a razor, leading him to sever an artery and ultimately bleed to death. At the scene, Mulder talks over the phone with Scully, who explains that it is likely a case of drug-induced <b>delusional</b> parasitosis, though Mulder finds a cockroach on the underside of a piece of furniture, indicating that roaches were at least present. When he attempts to capture it for analysis, the insect crumbles in his hand and the sharp pieces cut his fingers in the process, leading him to believe that the brittle casing was made of metal. Sheriff Frass purports that the government, under the guise of the USDA, has been breeding killer cockroaches in a nearby facility. Immediately afterwards, the medical examiner is found dead in a bathroom stall, initially covered with cockroaches that disappear from the scene before more than one person can witness them. Scully attributes the medical examiner's death to a cerebral aneurysm induced by overstraining while defecating. Mulder and Sheriff Frass find a seemingly dead cockroach on a sink in the bathroom, and Mulder again attempts to capture it (albeit more gingerly this time), but it proves to be alive and escapes down the drain.|$|E
5|$|Takumi {{learns that}} he is an artificial, <b>delusional</b> clone with {{fabricated}} memories, created by Shogun – the real Takumi. His sister Nanami is being held in the location of the real Noah II, where she is made to awaken as a gigalomaniac and obtain a Di-Sword. Rimi – also a gigalomaniac – tries to save her, but is attacked by Norose and is taken prisoner in Nanami's stead. Shogun again meets with Takumi to tell him that he had intended to stop Nozomi from taking over humanity with Noah II, but that his body – aged from disease and overuse of gigalomaniac powers – hindered him, prompting him to create Takumi to do it in his stead. Takumi obtains a Di-Sword, and destroys the transmitters, revealing the nurse Hazuki to be the New Gen killer in the process by reading her memories and projecting them onto the screens on the buildings. An earthquake occurs, destroying much of Shibuya; Takumi rescues the other gigalomaniacs from the destruction, and continues to the location of Noah II. He fights Norose, but Noah II activates its self-defense mode, overwhelming Takumi with delusions; he reaffirms his existence, and destroys Norose and Noah II with his Di-Sword. As he lies in the ruins of Shibuya, depending on what delusions the player has chosen, he either gives up his life along with the dying Shogun's, or stays alive with Rimi.|$|E
25|$|<b>Delusional</b> projection: Delusions about {{external}} reality, usually of a persecutory nature.|$|E
25|$|Some {{distinguish}} <b>delusional</b> and non-delusional {{forms of}} ORS. In the <b>delusional</b> type, there is complete {{conviction that the}} odor is real. In the non-delusional type, the individual is capable of {{some insight into the}} condition, and can recognize that the odor might not be real, and that their level of concern is excessive. Others argue that reported cases of ORS present a spectrum of different levels of insight. Since sometimes the core belief of ORS is not of <b>delusional</b> intensity, it is argued that considering the condition as a form of <b>delusional</b> disorder, as seems to occur in the DSM, is inappropriate. In one review, in 57% of cases the beliefs were fixed, held with complete conviction, and the individual could not be reassured that the odor was non existent. In 43% of cases the individual held the beliefs with less than complete conviction, and was able to varying degrees to consider the possibility that the odor was not existent.|$|E
25|$|The Fregoli {{delusion}} or Fregoli {{syndrome is}} a rare disorder {{in which a person}} holds a <b>delusional</b> belief that different people are in fact a single person who changes appearance or is in disguise. The syndrome may be related to a brain lesion and is often of a paranoid nature with the <b>delusional</b> person believing the person they believe to be in disguise is persecuting them.|$|E
25|$|Psychotherapies {{that may}} be helpful in <b>delusional</b> {{disorder}} include individual psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and family therapy.|$|E
25|$|The {{depression}} {{does not}} exist only {{as part of a}} chronic psychosis (such as schizophrenia or <b>delusional</b> disorder).|$|E
25|$|Delusion {{of guilt}} or sin (or {{delusion}} of self-accusation): Ungrounded feeling of remorse or guilt of <b>delusional</b> intensity.|$|E
25|$|Explaining {{the causes}} of {{delusions}} continues to be challenging and several theories have been developed. One is the genetic or biological theory, which states that close relatives of people with <b>delusional</b> disorder {{are at increased risk}} of <b>delusional</b> traits. Another theory is the dysfunctional cognitive processing, which states that delusions may arise from distorted ways people have of explaining life to themselves. A third theory is called motivated or defensive delusions. This one states that some of those persons who are predisposed might suffer the onset of <b>delusional</b> disorder in those moments when coping with life and maintaining high self-esteem becomes a significant challenge. In this case, the person views others as the cause of their personal difficulties in order to preserve a positive self-view.|$|E
25|$|<b>Delusional</b> jealousy: False {{belief that}} a spouse or lover is having an affair, with no proof to back up their claim.|$|E
25|$|Synonyms for ORS, many historical, include bromidrosiphobia, {{olfactory}} phobic syndrome, chronic olfactory paranoid syndrome, autodysomophobia, {{delusions of}} bromosis, hallucinations of smell and olfactory <b>delusional</b> syndrome. By definition, the many terms {{which have been}} suggested in the dental literature to refer to subjective halitosis complaints (i.e. where a person complains of halitosis yet no odor is detectable clinically) {{can also be considered}} under the umbrella of ORS. Examples include halitophobia, non-genuine halitosis, <b>delusional</b> halitosis, pseudo-halitosis, imaginary halitosis, psychosomatic halitosis, and self halitosis.|$|E
25|$|In February 2011 an Oregon court {{declared}} Acremant so <b>delusional</b> that {{he could}} not assist in his death sentence appeal and his sentence was reduced to life without parole.|$|E
25|$|Studies on {{psychiatric}} patients {{show that}} delusions vary in intensity and conviction over time, {{which suggests that}} certainty and incorrigibility are not necessary components of a <b>delusional</b> belief.|$|E
25|$|Serious infestations {{and chronic}} attacks can cause anxiety, stress, and insomnia. Development of {{refractory}} <b>delusional</b> parasitosis is possible, {{as a person}} develops an overwhelming obsession with bed bugs.|$|E
25|$|The {{medical expert}} Leipziger defended his report against {{claims that it}} did not {{withstand}} the inquest of the audit report. In the case of <b>delusional</b> disorders there were often underlying truths.|$|E
