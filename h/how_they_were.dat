5|$|According to Herodotus, {{there were}} a total of 69,500 lightly armed troops – 35,000 helots and 34,500 troops {{from the rest of}} Greece; roughly one per hoplite. The number of 34,500 has been {{suggested}} to represent one light skirmisher supporting each non-Spartan hoplite (33,700), together with 800 Athenian archers, whose presence in the battle Herodotus later notes. Herodotus tells us that {{there were a}}lso 1,800 Thespians (but does not say <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> equipped), giving a total strength of 108,200 men.|$|E
5|$|Another {{indication}} that feet and other tetrapod traits evolved while {{the animals were}} still aquatic is <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> feeding.

Prey could be caught in the shallows, at the water's edge or on land, but had to be eaten in water where hydrodynamic forces from the expansion of their buccal cavity would force the food into their esophagus.|$|E

5|$|Dan Tucker is {{both the}} teller and subject of the story. Verses 1, 3, and 5 of the 1843 edition are in the first person, whereas verses 2, 4, and 7 are in the third. This {{reflects}} the song's intended performance by an entire minstrel troupe. The lead minstrel played Tucker and began the song, but backup singers took over at times to allow Tucker to act out the scenario, dance, and do another comedy bit. There was probably an element of competition to the various dance and music solos. The third-person verses also allowed for commentary to suggest to the audience <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> to judge the character and his antics.|$|E

5|$|However, {{right after}} Dubček assumed power, the scholar Eduard Goldstücker became {{chairman}} of the Union of Czechoslovak Writers and thus editor-in-chief of the previously hard-line communist weekly Literární noviny, which under Novotny had been filled with party loyalists. Goldstucker tested the boundaries of Dubček’s devotion to {{freedom of the press}} when he appeared on a television interview as the new head of the union. On 4 February, in front of the entire nation, he openly criticized Novotny, exposing all of Novotny’s previously unreported policies and explaining <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> preventing progress in Czechoslovakia.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{intended}} to {{only be a}} one-year project, Cirque du Soleil was scheduled to perform in 11 towns in Quebec {{over the course of}} 13 weeks running concurrent with the third La Fête Foraine. The first shows were riddled with difficulty, starting {{with the collapse of the}} big top after the increased weight of rainwater caused the central mast to snap. Working with a borrowed tent, Laliberté then had to contend with difficulties with the European performers. They were so unhappy with the Quebec circus's inexperience that they had, at one point, sent a letter to the media complaining about <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> being treated.|$|E
5|$|The {{excavations}} {{have revealed}} {{information about the}} original priory buildings and grounds, and <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> subsequently modified. A series of ditches was found that would have provided a supply of fresh water and also a means for drainage of a relatively wet site. Evidence of the earliest temporary timber buildings in which the canons were originally housed {{was found in the}} form of 12th-century post pits. Norton Priory is one of few monastic sites to have produced evidence of temporary quarters. The remains of at least seven temporary buildings have been discovered. It is considered that the largest of these, because it had more substantial foundations than the others, was probably the timber-framed church; another was most likely the gatehouse, and the other buildings provided accommodation for the canons and the senior secular craftsmen.|$|E

5|$|World War I {{memorials}} made {{extensive use}} of symbolism and allegory. Some of these symbols were national in character, carrying a simple message about national victory – a Gallic rooster triumphing over a German, the croix de guerre, or the Romanians' symbol for their heroes' cult for example – but others, such as images of infantrymen, {{could be used in}} different ways, depending on <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> portrayed. Some sculpture of French infantrymen, for example, aims to capture the spirit of French republicanism, while others are designed with more right-wing, nationalist attributes.|$|E
5|$|General (Polish: generalny, Latin conventiones generales), held {{in western}} Poland (Greater Poland) at Koło, in {{southern}} Poland (Little Poland) at Nowe Miasto Korczyn, in Masovia at Warsaw, in Red Ruthenia at Sądowa Wisznia (Sudova Vyshnia), and in Lithuania at Wołkowysk (Vawkavysk). The General Sejmiks were composed of delegates elected at the provincial sejmiks, and of Senators. Their {{goal was to}} agree on a position for the General Sejm (Sejm Walny) and issue instructions for the deputies on <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> supposed to vote during the General Sejm. The competences of the general sejmiks were defined by precedent and custom rather than law; on rare instances when external circumstances prevented a national Sejm from being convened (such as 1511, 1513 and 1577), the general sejmiks were seen as competent to legislate on national matters. In the 15th century some general sejmiks reserved the right to accept or reject national legislation. In the 16th century they were tasked with preparing drafts of legislation to be discussed at Sejms. Around the 17th century general sejmiks were mostly abandoned (with the exceptions of those in Royal Prussia, see Prussian estates); instead, provincial deputies would meet in special sessions during the Sejm proper.|$|E

It took these really irrational acts of love to sort of discover them against <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> built... I realized that that's a perfect metaphor for real life. We all fall into our habits, our routines and our ruts, consciously or unconsciously to avoid living. To avoid having to do the messy part. To avoid having relationships with other people or dealing with the person next to us. That's why we can all get on our cell phones and not have to deal with one another. I thought, 'That's a perfect amplification of {{the whole point of the}} movie.' I wanted to run with science in a way that would sort of logically project that.|$|E

5|$|Li Yuan's {{army that}} arrived at Huoyi {{numbered}} less than its original 30,000 men, perhaps {{as few as}} 25,000, due to the detachments left behind. It was predominantly composed of infantry was divided into six divisions under a general (tongjun), but it is unclear <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> subordinated to Li Yuan and his sons: Li Jiancheng and Li Shimin were named in the traditional fashion as commanders of {{the left and right}} respectively, but in the accounts of the battle, the army appears formed in van, middle and rear divisions. The cavalry, a few hundred strong, was apparently kept as a strategic reserve. Very little is also known about the Sui army, except that Song Laosheng's troops were considered to be elite warriors. Some sources raise their number to 30,000 from the more typical 20,000; this could be an error, or possibly indicate additional forces recruited at Huoyi.|$|E
5|$|The great {{majority}} of Australian aircrew in Bomber Command were graduates of the Empire Air Training Scheme. These men were not concentrated in Australian units, and were instead often posted to the Commonwealth squadron with the greatest need for personnel where they became part of a multi-national bomber crew. Five Australian heavy bomber squadrons (No.460, No.462, No.463, No.466 and No.467squadrons) were formed within Bomber Command between 1941 and 1945, however, {{and the proportion of}} Australians in these units increased over time. No.464Squadron, which was equipped with light bombers, was also formed as part of Bomber Command but was transferred to the Second Tactical Air Force in June 1943 where it continued to attack targets in Europe. Unlike Canada, which concentrated its heavy bomber squadrons into No.6Group RCAF in 1943, the RAAF squadrons in Bomber Command were always part of British units, and the Australian Government had little control over <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> used.|$|E
5|$|This theory {{stems from}} the various rumours {{spreading}} after Centaurs sinking. If Centaur had been in breach of the Hague Convention of 1907, and someone had informed the Japanese of this, I-177 may have been under valid orders to attack. When Centaur left Sydney, her decks were packed with green-uniformed men, and as Field Ambulance uniforms were only distinguishable from other Army uniforms by badge insignia and the colouration of the cloth band ringing the hat, a distant observer could {{have concluded that the}} hospital ship was transporting soldiers. Those witnessing the loading in Sydney would have seen the ambulance drivers bring their weapons aboard, and could have come to a similar conclusion. If a spy or informant had passed this information to the Japanese, I-177 could have been lying in wait. The main flaw in this theory is the question of how Nakagawa and his crew were able to predict that Centaur was taking an alternative route and <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> able to determine the new route selected.|$|E
