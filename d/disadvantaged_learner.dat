40|$|DISADVANTAGED PEOPLE are apathetic toward {{and anxious}} about any {{organization}} {{in which there}} is a credibility gap between what it purports to provide and what it actually does provide. The effective library enables the disadvantaged person to find answers to his immediate problems. Disadvantaged people may have to go through one stage of using the library for practical immediate information before they can accommodate themselves to use the library for aesthetic satisfaction. The purpose of this article is to summarize current research findings in reading and to describe programs and practices about the disadvantaged as they relate or may relate to the library and librarians. The article has been divided into a number of sections in order to discuss the various aspects of reading research and practices. The final section consists of a variety of implications which have been culled from the research and the reported practices, as well as the experiences of the authors of this article in working with the <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>learner.</b> FAMILY STATUS AND HOME ENVIRONMENT In identifying characteristics of the <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>learner,</b> the home environment has received considerable attention. Bloom, et at., stated that the home is the single most important influence on the intellectual and emotional development of young children. They noted that there were fewer books in lower class homes, and that children were read to less frequently and spoken to less by their parents than upper class children. Their environment has been described as overcrowded, noisy...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} the overall theme {{of a collection}} of six papers (each with separate commentary) inspired by research in cognitive psychology. The dominant approaches to instructing educationally disadvantaged children have focused on the teaching of basic skills, with little regard for the more advanced skills of reasoning, problem solving, and independent thinking. This collection of papers focuses on alternative models for teaching the advanced skills of mathematics reasoning, reading comprehension, problem solving, and composition. These models represent a new attitude toward disadvantaged ("at risk") learners. The following major themes underlie these approaches: (1) a new attitude toward the <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>learner</b> emphasizing intellectual strengths and accomplishments and acknowledging cultural differences; (2) reshaping the curriculum for relevance and emphasis on advanced skills; and (3...|$|E
40|$|M. A. The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between career maturity and career decision-making self-efficacy expectations among disadvantaged Grade 12 students. Factor analysis was used for this purpose. The construct of career maturity was dealt with comprehensively by means of a theoretical review of the contributions made by Donald Super, John Crites and Ronelle Langley. The second construct, i. e., career decision-making self-efficacy expectations was covered by reviewing the contributions of Albert Bandura, Nancy Betz, Steven Brown, Gail Hackett and Robert Lent. Three measurement instruments were utilised, namely, the Biographical Questionnaire, the Career Development Questionnaire (CDQ) and the Career Decision-Making Self-Efficacy Scale (CDMSES). The data was analysed by means of principal factor analysis with iterated communalities. The Scree-test and eigenvalues-greater-than-one criterion were used to determine the number of factors. The factors were obliquely rotated according to the Promax criterion. The factor analysis revealed that career maturity and career decisionmaking self-efficacy expectations are two distinguishable but empirically and conceptually related constructs. Although the CDQ and CDMSES and their respective sub-scales define two separate factors, the correlation between the factors show that they are not entirely independent. Factor analysis also revealed that the CDQ and CDMSES were valid and reliable measures of career maturity and career decision-making selfefficacy for a sample other than the white, middle-class samples. The results also show that the <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>learner</b> has a lower level of career maturity and career decision-making self-efficacy as compared to a normative high school sample and an affluent sample. These results were expected, especially in the light of South Africa's historical past. Changes in the economic environment may prove to be instrumental in changing perceptions about the world of work and attitudes towards career planning and choice. Researchers are challenged to implement programmes that will assist in the enhancement of career maturity and career decision-making self-efficacy ofthe <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>learner...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{link between}} {{disadvantage}} and educational underachievement is still strong. Most schools still fail to target support specifically at <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>learners</b> {{and only a}} few analyse data effectively enough to identify <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>learners.</b> Most schools do not use their assessment and tracking systems well enough to monitor the progress of <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>learners.</b> The few schools that support their <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>learners</b> well implement systematic, whole-school approaches for teaching and learning that benefit all learners and support individual <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>learners</b> by providing mentoring or help with basic skills and homework. Nearly all schools see themselves as community-focused and work with a range of agencies. However, school leaders do not usually co-ordinate multi-agency working systematically enough to ensure that <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>learners</b> are supported in the most effective and timely way. Only a few schools plan explicitly to raise disadvantaged learners’ aspirations. Although many schools offer a range of out-of-hours learning, only in a few are these extra activities carefully planned to increase disadvantaged learners’ confidence, motivation and self-esteem. Where schools have had the greatest impact on raising learners’ achievement, staff plan out-of-hours learning to match the needs of learners and to complement the curriculum. School leaders generally have not received enough training on working with the community or services, or on using data to evaluate initiatives to tackle disadvantage. Schools do not share best practice or collaborate effectively with each other in this area.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to determine the modes of thinking and learning of South African <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>learners</b> as well as to discover whether the teaching methods used by their teachers, encourage diverse cognitive skills and learning styles amongst learners. A survey of existing literature on this subject identifies a number of theories that indicate that learners come to school with diverse modes of thinking and learning. Furthermore, existing literature, indicate that educationally <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>learners</b> tend towards a Field Dependent, socially orientated mode of cognitive processing and a largely visual and kinaesthetic mode of sensory processing information. Research also reveals that teaching methods and teacher expectation of learner potential {{play a vital role in}} the academic achievement of <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>learners.</b> Teachers tend to have lower expectations of the academic potential of <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>learners.</b> Moreover, teachers tend to favour teaching methods that meet the needs of learners who use Field Independent cognitive and Auditory sensory processing. Another aspect acknowledged in existing literature that influences the academic achievement of <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>learners</b> is the role of family and the community. <b>Disadvantaged</b> <b>learners</b> generally do not have the support and security of a stable home and are frequently exposed to violence and an educationally impoverished environment. Parents and guardians tend to be less involved in the education of their children. <b>Disadvantaged</b> <b>learners</b> who were part of this empirical study conducted in the Ekhuruleni Metropolitan area, east of Johannesburg, South Africa, showed a more concrete approach to academic activities and revealed a tendency towards Field Dependency and a visual and kinaesthetic sensory approach to processing information. Learners preferred more frequent social interaction during academic activities. The study also found that the teaching method most commonly used in the geographical area mentioned above, took the form of lecturing or `chalk-and-talk' and that teaching aids generally took the form of worksheets. Hence the teaching approach most used by teachers in the study, did not address the modes of thinking and learning of <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>learners</b> in the schools that participated in the empirical study and generally did not encourage deeper cognitive structures.

40|$|Vocational Education and Training (VET) {{students}} experiencing {{mental illness}} {{have been described}} {{as one of the most}} vulnerable student groups in the Australian post-secondary sector. This vulnerability can be attributed to the impacts of illness, the oft-reported experiences of stigma and discrimination, and low educational outcomes. There is increased pressure for researchers and policy-makers to listen to the voices of the most disadvantaged learners to aid design and delivery of the Australian VET system, yet little knowledge exists in the sector about how this could and should occur. This paper critically reflects on some of the ethical issues and methodological challenges recently encountered in our research with VET students experiencing mental illness. Through rich description of our strategies for student recruitment and managing participant vulnerability, we aim to contribute to the literature informing qualitative research with VET students experiencing mental health issues.

40|$|An {{important}} aspect of print-based open distance learning (ODL) is the effective management of a learner support system that caters for the rural, <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>learner.</b> Unfortunately, this is often neglected by many institutions that offer distance education programmes. It is a well-known fact that the rural environment is often not conducive to distance learning {{because of the lack}} of resources and amenities such as electricity and modern communication networks. This article highlights how the Unisa Adult Basic Education and Training (ABET) Institute organises and manages an effective tutorial system for disadvantaged, rural distance learners. The article argues that one of the main reasons why many rural learners drop out of distance education programmes is a lack of effective support that can see them through their studies. In other words, effective management of the support system is crucial if learners are to be retained on print-based ODL programmes. Such a well-managed support system could offer distance learners some sort of `customer care ' in the form of minimal face-to-face tutorials. The effective management of this `customer care', which has been the secret of success for the Unisa ABET Institute over the years, is worth sharing...|$|E
40|$|Research on best {{practices}} in higher education aimed at empowering the <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>learner</b> is scanty. The Learning Advancement Unit of the University of Fort Hare under the Teaching and Learning centre has been established to support learning among students from diverse backgrounds. A unique feature is that this Unit trains and uses an array of local and international scholars to facilitate higher learning {{with a view of}} impacting positively on student academic performance. This paper reports on how learning programmes at the rural-based tri-campus University have been structured, run and integrated using {{best practices}} for the benefit of local and international students. Using secondary statistical data, captured from various activities in the programmes on offer, the paper generally reveals how such innovative programmes have impacted positively on academic access and performance, socio-cultural and technological integration. Furthermore, the paper highlights a regrettable trend of underutilisation by students, of the services offered, particularly by international students, and an apparent reluctance by locals and females to take up academic support roles in the Unit. The positive impact of the initiatives make a strong case for investment in marketing and championing these programmes amongst students; {{at the same time it}} is clearly important to consider ways of improving staff attraction and retention to ensure continuity within the programmes...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{benefits}} of not-for-profit education for disadvantaged learners in Hong Kong. The economic success of Hong Kong is {{seen by many as}} a miracle of the 156 years’ British colonial governance. Hong Kong’s world-class education system, which combines British meritocratic education traditions and Chinese conventional philosophies on hard work and respect for examination high fliers, has led to rapid and sustained economic development. However, those who do not fit into the mainstream selective education system are damagingly marginalised. Not-for-profit education providers are increasingly being used to try to repair some of this damage, but their effectiveness is not known. Statistical data on, for example, student enrolment, completion and graduation, courses offered and subsidies spent, do not completely and comprehensively reflect the broad number of ways in which these courses may make a difference. Using the conceptual framework developed by the Centre for the Wider Benefits of Learning, this thesis draws on twenty-three in-depth life story interviews with four <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>learner</b> groups – young people who are ‘not in education, employment, or training (NEET) ’, ‘economically marginalised’, ‘older adults’, and ‘new immigrants from mainland China’. The analysis of these interviews uses a learner’s capital and capability model and shows that different disadvantaged learners derive different kinds of benefits and capital gains from different not-for-profit education. Youth NEET perceived the highest gains in identity capital and economically marginalised learners reported the highest gains in human capital. Older adult disadvantaged learners perceived the highest gains in social capital and new immigrants from mainland China found human capital gains most important. Different disadvantaged learners also benefitted from different kinds and different levels of unexpected learning benefits which are seen as ‘surplus’ to their learning. Government subsidies and assistance through student loans and charity funding mean that not-for-profit courses are provided at lower cost than private provision. Moreover, since it is not government-provided, participants who have had a bad experience of government-provided compulsory education may feel they {{have a better chance of}} success with non-government courses. Not-for-profit education also tends to be able to offer more flexible provision which helps the disadvantaged learners who often have complex family and personal circumstances. The implications of this research suggest that more can be done to optimise the social benefits and utilities of not-for-profit education in Hong Kong. In particular, the newly developed qualifications framework should flexibly include and recognise the contribution of not-for-profit education for the disadvantaged. ‘Individual Learning Accounts’ might also promote citizens’ participation in lifelong and life-wide learning. Lastly, a new governing body, a Lifelong Learning Board, should be introduced to coordinate, administer and develop lifelong learning in Hong Kong...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) -University of Durban-Westville, 2003. The {{present study}} {{explored}} {{the attitudes and}} the expectations that educators have towards learners who are deprived by poverty. The influence of the educators' race and gender on these attitudes and expectations was explored {{as well as the}} relationship between indigent learners and their educators. The challenges that face educators on a daily basis, make teaching a particularly daunting task. In addition educators have the complex task of teaching learners who come from a diverse range of home backgrounds. These stressors combine to create a complicated learning environment. The interplay between home environmental risk factors, teacher support and learner achievement and performance is of utmost importance for eventual school success and a positive self-perception for the learner. This study was conducted by using a survey questionnaire which was completed by 53 educators (Indian and African), and semi-structured interviews with 12 indigent learners. The researcher was able to determine the emergent attitudes and expectations of educators according to the educator's race and gender. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 indigent learners to determine their relationship with their teachers and their self-perceptions. The responses to the interviews were qualitatively analysed. The findings of this study have indicated that generally, educators have positive attitudes towards indigent learners. They are supportive of these learners and try, in most instances, to plan lessons in a manner that would benefit the <b>disadvantaged</b> <b>learner.</b> With regard to race and gender, African male educators were the highest number that perceived indigent learners negatively, while African female educators appear to be the most sympathetic and held the least negative views on indigent learners. Results also indicated that the majority of educators had formed pre-conceived expectations about learner's abilities based on variables such as the home background, knowledge of siblings performances in school, dress and speech. Although African male educators had the most negative attitudes towards indigent learners, they (African male educators) also held the highest expectations of indigent learners as compared to Indian female educators who held the lowest expectations. This means that African male educators believe that indigent learners have the potential and perform relatively well in the classroom despite their poverty status. The results of the semi-structured interviews, which were qualitatively analysed, indicated that generally, the indigent learners who were interviewed, were happy at school, had friends and enjoyed a good relationship with their teachers. These learners appeared to always try hard with their schoolwork and held high career aspirations. Based on these findings, it appears that generally, the indigent learners who were interviewed had positive self-esteem based on positive relationships with their educators. The findings of this research were discussed in relation to previous findings from international literature. The study was concluded with recommendations to educators on monitoring and controlling expectance effects and bias on the achievement and social behaviour of learners...|$|E

Organisations {{have come}} to exist for a {{definite}} purpose, which is to combine and transform scarce factors of production into products and services with maximum economic utility. They strive to attain the highest possible output of need satisfying products and/or services with the lowest possible input of production factors. In order to achieve the level of growth and development required to enable it {{to compete in a}} climate of fierce international competition from other developed countries, post – apartheid South Africa needs a focused, motivated and skilled workforce. Yet, the current reality is often that of South African companies’ being handicapped by an under-skilled and, frequently, under-performing workforce. In addition, tertiary institutions experience low pass rates and high attrition rates among previously disadvantaged students, despite efforts to provide extra academic support and enrichment programmes. In this study, it is believed that one aspect of the difficult that many disadvantaged students have to achieve either in tertiary study or in the workplace, {{can be attributed to the}} lack of career maturity of such learners to make optimal career choices.
