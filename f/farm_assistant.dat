Mulli attended the Kyamulendu and Kathithyamaa schools in Kangundo, Machakos; completing his primary education in 1966, {{he was unable to}} enter secondary school because he could not afford it. At age 17, Mulli walked 70 kilometers to Nairobi in search of employment; he found work at a private home where his duties included tilling the garden, washing clothes, cooking in the kitchen, and various other domestic chores. A year later, Mulli was promoted to a <b>farm</b> <b>assistant</b> and transferred to Kakuzi Farm in Thika where he met his future wife, Esther Nthenya.

He was educated at state schools and {{initially}} worked as a dairy <b>farm</b> <b>assistant</b> before becoming a real estate agent. When he was in his 30s, Jordan studied law at the University of Sydney and was called to the NSW bar in 1936. Jordan was an alderman on Ryde Municipal Council between 1935 and 1937 and a councillor on Manning Shire Council between 1951 and 1956. He was shire president during those years. Despite his urban background, he made unsuccessful attempts to win the seat of Raleigh at the 1938 and 1941 state elections.

Eventually, Charlotte reveals {{her plan}} to [...] "play a trick on Zuckerman", and {{consoles}} Wilbur to sleep. The next morning, Homer's <b>farm</b> <b>assistant,</b> Lurvy, sees the words, SOME PIG, spun within Charlotte's web. The incident attracts publicity among Homer's neighbors who deem the praise to be a miracle. The publicity eventually dies down, and Charlotte requests the barn animals {{to devise a}} new word to spin within her web. After several suggestions, the goose suggests the phrase, TERRIFIC! TERRIFIC! TERRIFIC!, though Charlotte decides to shorten it to one TERRIFIC. The incident becomes another media sensation, though Homer still desires to slaughter Wilbur. For the next message, Charlotte then employs Templeton to pull a word from a magazine clipping at the dump for inspiration, in which he returns the word, RADIANT, ripped from a soap box to spin within her web. Following this, Homer decides to enter Wilbur in the county fair for the summer. Charlotte reluctantly decides to accompany him, though Templeton at first {{has no interest in}} doing so until the goose tells him about all the food there. After one night there, Charlotte sends Templeton to the trash pile on another errand to gather another word for her next message, in which he returns with the word, HUMBLE. The next morning, Wilbur awakens to find Charlotte has spun an egg sac containing her unborn offspring, and the following afternoon, the word, HUMBLE, is spun. However, Fern's brother, Avery, discovers another pig named Uncle has won first place, though the county fair staff decides to hold a celebration in honor of Homer's miraculous pig, and rewards him $25 and a gold medal. He then announces that he will allow Wilbur to [...] "live to a ripe old age".|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Industrial {{revolution}} {{no doubt}} is adding {{a lot to}} the human life {{but at the same time}} it is polluting the atmosphere as well. Agricultural industries are no exception. In order to crack the demand and supply gap, it became essential to minimize the losses on the farm and increase the yield; various control strategies, which include chemical applications, have been developed and are in practice. But the use of these chemicals & pesticides are endangering the environment by polluting the atmosphere. Now this pollution has started giving health hazards which has to be taken urgent care. Hence there is increasing pressure to reduce the use of pesticides in modern crop production to decrease the environmental impact of current practice and to lower the production costs. It is therefore imperative that chemical sprays are only applied when and where needed. Since diseases in field are frequently patchy, chemicals may be avoided from being applied unnecessarily to disease-free areas. Main object of present research is automation of the early detection of grape plant disease and assist the farmer by giving the information regarding targeted application of the required medicine to protect and care their infected plants from diseases. At present the prevalent practice of detection is by human eyes which have its limitations because there are many microscopic disease symptoms beyond visual observations. Due to limited visual nature of the plant monitoring task, computer vision techniques seem to be well adapted. An automated machine / robot can send the information by voice/computer message or automatically apply the required chemicals at target point. In view of the above the present research was conducted and a robotic <b>farm</b> <b>assistant</b> carrying a SENSOR capable of detecting downy mildew disease and recommending proper chemical dose has been developed. This robot has been developed in two folds: 1. an automatic navigator the “Robo Kisan ” equipped with sensors for automatic mobility in the grape field and 2. a sensor for detecting the downy mildew disease...|$|E

3000|$|According to the neo-Austrian {{perspective}} {{adopted by}} this paper, {{it is possible}} to sustain the hypothesis that the family farm’s alertness is significantly higher in the case of either young farms or young <b>farms</b> where <b>assistants</b> support the farmer’s activity, above all {{in the early stages of}} life cycle. However, the explanation for the ability of young farmers of obtaining funds from rural development policies cannot overlook the fact that the subjective condition of a [...] "young farmer" [...] is a priority in the allocation of resources for rural development. There is also a specific measure for the settlement of young farmers and an implicit resource reservation. On the other side, that means that “targetisation” works well in improving generational renewal. In this perspective, the introduction of a demographic viewpoint has given important insights, in order to fully understand the decision making mechanism to consume rural policies. The differences due to the two adopted demographic perspectives support the necessity to discriminate the supply of policy by taking these factors into account. More precisely, the discovered impact of the presence of family members working as assistants should encourage policies to foster their permanence in the farm and to avoid the search of off-farm jobs. Surely, rural development policies aimed at encouraging a farm’s boundary shift (Banks et al. 2002) are in the agenda, but they are not exploited enough, owing to a set of motivations well described in other studies on the subject. To this end, more efforts are necessary to increase the percentage of access and, through this, raise the probability of higher levels of persistency of family farms.|$|R
