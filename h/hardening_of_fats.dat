The causes of death that had increased most in previous years were lung cancer, coronary thrombosis, and leukemia and Hugh believed essential fatty acid (EFA) deficiency to be important in all three. EFA deficiency causes extra deposition of cholesterol esters in the epidermis. Hugh thought the tetraenoic arachidonic acid to be the most important EFA. Its biosynthesis requires vitamin B6. <b>Hardening</b> <b>of</b> <b>fats</b> reduces EFAs and changing to low-extraction flour diminishes the vitamin B6 content. Improvers, such as chlorine dioxide, destroy any EFA present, as well as vitamin E, which would protect it.|$|E

The disorder is also regularly found in captive-bred animals fed on high fish diets, such as mink, pigs and poultry. It shows as a rubber-like <b>hardening</b> <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> reserves which then become unavailable for normal metabolism, resulting in extreme pain, loss of mobility and death.|$|R
40|$|Fat {{migration}} {{is the main}} reason for the loss of quality of stored chocolate products. It includes the unpleasant softening of filled chocolates and the <b>hardening</b> <b>of</b> their fillings. Chocolates with nuts, nougat, marzipan or wafers often develop <b>fat</b> bloom because <b>of</b> migration of filling oils. The kinetics <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> migration and the major parameters as product geometry, diffusion constant, storage temperature and formulations are described. HPLC-analysis was used to study the diffusion of triglycerides...|$|R
2500|$|Those {{opposed to}} {{homogenization}} argue that decreasing the size <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> globules may have unhealthy effects, including allowing steroid and protein hormones to bypass normal digestion and increase their {{levels in the}} body. Concerns that uptake of the protein xanthine oxidase is increased by homogenization, leading to <b>hardening</b> <b>of</b> the arteries (atherosclerosis), were raised in the 1970s. Subsequent research [...] "failed to substantiate, {{and in many cases}} has refuted" [...] a plausible effect of xanthine oxidase from homogenized milk on cardiovascular disease.|$|R
