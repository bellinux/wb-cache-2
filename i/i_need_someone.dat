It {{is bad for}} the vassals and tenants of a noble--even {{though a}} newly made one, and on an estate of {{moderate}} dimensions--when their lord is absent, and there is none to look after them save an intendant, whose duty it is to collect as much rent as he is able. Such is the position of my tenants. I am a soldier, and must perforce be absent. What I need greatly is someone who will fill my place in this respect. I have an old friend who is captain of the garrison, and sees to all things in the household; I have an intendant, I believe a worthy young man, who collects my rents and looks to the feeding {{and needs of the}} servants and garrison; but <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>someone</b> who would interest herself actively in the condition of my tenants, who would be a friend to them in sickness, would give aid from my purse to those who really need it, would send food to the starving, and aid my intendant by advising him as to who are worthy of relief and who are suffering from their own idleness or thriftlessness--who will, in short, act as I would have my wife act had I one.|$|E
6000|$|Now the {{essential}} trouble {{of my life}} is its petty weaknesses. If I am to have that love, that sense of understanding fellowship, which is, I conceive, the peculiar magic and merit of this idea of a personal Saviour, then <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>someone</b> quite other than this image of virtue, this terrible and incomprehensible Galilean with his crown of thorns, his blood-stained hands and feet. I cannot love him any more than I can love a man upon the rack. Even {{in the face of}} torments I do not think I should feel a need for him. I had rather then a hundred times have Botticelli's armed angel in his Tobit at Florence. (I hope I do not seem to want to shock in writing these things, but indeed my only aim is to lay my feelings bare.) I know what love for an idealized person can be. It happens that in my younger days I found a character in the history of literature who had a singular and extraordinary charm for me, of whom the thought was tender and comforting, who indeed helped me through shames and humiliations as though he held my hand. This person was Oliver Goldsmith. His blunders and troubles, his vices and vanities, seized and still hold my imagination. The slights of Boswell, the contempt of Gibbon and all his company save Johnson, the exquisite fineness of spirit in his [...] "Vicar of Wakefield," [...] and that green suit of his and the doctor's cane and the love despised, these things together made him a congenial saint and hero for me, so that I thought of him as others pray. When I think of that youthful feeling for Goldsmith, I know what I need in a personal Saviour, as a troglodyte who has seen a candle can imagine the sun. But the Christian Christ in none of his three characteristic phases, neither as the magic babe (from whom I am cut off by the wanton and indecent purity of the Immaculate Conception), nor as the white-robed, spotless miracle worker, nor as the fierce unreal torment of the cross, comes close to my soul. I do not understand the Agony in the Garden; to me it is like a scene from a play in an unknown tongue. The la t cry of despair is the one human touch, discordant {{with all the rest of}} the story. One cry of despair does not suffice. The Christian's Christ is too fine for me, not incarnate enough, not flesh enough, not earth enough. He was never foolish and hot-eared and inarticulate, never vain, he never forgot things, nor tangled his miracles. I could love him I think more easily if the dead had not risen and if he had lain in peace in his sepulchre instead of coming back more enhaloed and whiter than ever, as a postscript to his own tragedy.|$|E

There is something relentlessly nauseating about the need for being needed, and Mautner’s book does very little to comfort me in this state of discomfort. Quite to the contrary the book contributes to these feelings. And I like it. Language and the Market Society deals with the phenomenon of marketization, that is, the transformation of social spheres and practices into markets. Market society, according to Mautner, is a society where ‘the market exchange is no longer simply a process, but an all-encompassing social principle ’ (p. 1). As a consequence of marketization, the language, idea and logic of the market have come to permeate almost everything in the everyday lives of contemporary man and woman, from the public sector and religion, to the personal and social life. In the wake of marketi-zation, citizens have become customers of the state, hospital patients have turned into clients and the self has been transformed into a commodity on the markets of labour, friendship and love...|$|E

This is one of the desperate voices of one of Community Care Project’s Caregivers. Community Care Project (CCP) {{provides}} support for families who are infected and affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The researcher observed that many of the staff, volunteers and carers were experiencing exhaustion, depression and even burn-out as a result of continual caring for people infected by HIV/AIDS. Caring for a Person Living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) appeared to be a major stressor in the lives of caregivers, which was believed to affect a caregiver’s mental health and his or her ability to cope, as well as a caregiver’s general wellbeing. Thus, the research question was: “Do CCP caregivers providing care to People living with HIV/AIDS, receive sufficient psycho-social support?” The degree of psycho-social support that is presently available to caregivers, as well as whether current support is sufficient for maintained coping by caregivers within the HIV/AIDS context were addressed {{as an integral part of}} the research. A phenomelogical descriptive survey study design was used to explore the research question. Forty-two Caregivers participated in this study (population size of 97 possible CCP caregivers). Self-administered questionnaires were completed and two focus groups were conducted to explore the effects that caring for a PLHA had on ones’ coping ability, and whether one had sufficient psycho-social support for maintained coping. Analysis was carried out using manual coding for qualitative data, while the quantitative data was analysed using descriptive statistics. Results showed CCP caregivers are not receiving sufficient psycho-social support. Results also showed that demographic variables such as age, sex, health of PLHA, type of caregiver, monthly income, number of HIV-related deaths, and number of PLHA’s cared for did not affect a caregivers coping ability. Results showed poor access to and use of emotional support networks. 41 % of caregivers feel they are not currently coping with the stressors of caregiving and 88 % are experiencing one or more symptoms of burnout (the most common being insomnia, with 48 % of participants experiencing this symptom). The study concluded that caregiving has affected physical, mental and spiritual health of caregivers and many expressed that there had been significant decrease in their functioning as a result of their caregiving for PLHA’s...|$|E
