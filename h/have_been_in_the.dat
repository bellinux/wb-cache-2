50|$|Another AGA study <b>was</b> used <b>in</b> {{assessing}} <b>the</b> cultural adaption of Filipinos who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Navy. Three {{groups of}} Filipinos {{were compared to}} similarly composed groups of Americans: those who were newly recruited to the U.S. Navy, those who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Navy between 1 and 10 years, and those who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Navy from 11 to 25 years. The results indicated that cultural adaptation occurred most in domains such as “Work” and “Service.” Cultural adaptation occurred least in domains such as “Family,” “Friends,” “Society,” “Interpersonal Relations,” and “Religion.” These domains are most influenced by tradition and early socialization. This study also revealed that cultural adaption is also a function of time spent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> host environment. The change from the first group (new recruits) to the second group (those who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Navy 1-10 years) is faster than the change from the second group to the third group (those who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Navy 11-25 years).|$|R

5|$|The {{history of}} the Cotton {{manuscript}} itself is quite complex. The list of early writers above mentions that it may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> possession {{of at least two}} of them. It was owned by John Leland, the antiquary, in the 1540s. It probably became available after the dissolution of the monasteries, in which the property of many religious houses was confiscated and sold. Leland died in 1552 and it is known to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> possession of Matthew Parker from some time after that until his own death in 1575. Although Parker bequeathed most of his library to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, the Cotton manuscript was not included. By 1600, it was in the library of Lord Lumley and by 1621 the manuscript was in the possession of Robert Cotton. The Cotton library was moved in 1712 from Cotton House in Westminster to Essex House in the Strand and then moved again in 1730 to Ashburnham House in Westminster. On the morning of Saturday, 23 October 1731, a fire broke out and the Cotton manuscript was destroyed.|$|E
