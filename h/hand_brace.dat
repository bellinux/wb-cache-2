40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the complex issues affecting the postures {{people choose to}} use when attempting moderate load lifting exertions. In essence, lifting exertions are known to require a person to utilize muscle strength capabilities at each joint while also maintaining balance. As loads in the hand are located further away from the person both muscle and balance require-ments increase. By setting population limits to accommodate both a 90 %tile muscle strength capability and a functional balance capability within the University of Michigan's 3 D Static Strength Prediction Program, {{it was possible to}} run a set of trials which demonstrate the im-portance of both constraints when lifting loads in one and both hands placed at different horizontal distances away from the body. A small study showing the effects of one <b>handed</b> <b>bracing</b> was also performed. Results indicate that subtle changes in body postures and or <b>hand</b> <b>bracing</b> can affect the maximum distance a moderate load can be lifted. This demonstrates the general nature of the biomechanical strength and balance problems associated with the hori-zontal location of a moderate load, even when one <b>handed</b> <b>bracing</b> is possible.

The {{championship}} contenders Montoya qualified 3rd and Franchitti in 8th. Greg Moore was the only driver that did not make a qualifying run, thus starting {{at the rear of the}} field. Moore was not even certain to be in the race due to an accident in the paddock area the weekend before the race, where he was hit by a vehicle while riding his motor scooter. Moore suffered a broken hand in the incident and his team, Forsythe Racing, hired Roberto Moreno as an emergency backup driver if Moore could not run the entire race. After a medical consultation, and an in-car test, he was allowed to race using a <b>hand</b> <b>brace</b> and had the pain dulled with an injection of medicine.|$|E

40|$|Workers {{performing}} industrial tasks routinely encounter obstructions {{in their}} environment that limit the postures that they can achieve. However, many obstacles also {{provide an opportunity for}} <b>bracing</b> with a <b>hand</b> or thigh. Observations of automotive workers have shown that <b>hand</b> or thigh <b>bracing</b> is common during assembly tasks, suggesting that bracing may increase worker capability or decrease stress. Biomechanical analyses of tasks with bracing are difficult to conduct because the addition of the unknown bracing forces produces a mechanically indeterminate system. To address this issue, force and posture data were gathered in a laboratory study of 22 men and women {{with a wide range of}} body size. Subjects exerted one-handed isometric backward, forward, and upward exertions at four task-handle positions in the presence of a kinematic constraint that afforded thigh and <b>hand</b> <b>bracing</b> opportunities. Bracing with the contralateral hand or thigh was hypothesized to improve force-exertion capability, and both postures and bracing forces in the presence of kinematic constraints were hypothesized to depend on task conditions and bracing availability. Bracing with the contralateral hand and/or thighs significantly increased one-hand force exertion capability by 40 % on average. A method was developed to categorize bracing forces with respect to their contribution to task hand force generation. Decomposition of the bracing force vectors into opposing and non-opposing components enabled patterns of bracing forces to be classified into five distinct Force-Generation Strategies (FGS). Each FGS was associated with a particular posture pattern. Statistical models were developed to predict specific FGS and to predict posture variables and the magnitudes and directions of the task <b>hand</b> and <b>bracing</b> forces within each FGS and nominal task hand force direction. A conceptual model based on biomechanics principles was developed that accounts for the observed behaviors and forms a template for development of posture- and force-prediction models for use in industrial ergonomics. Guidelines for practitioners are presented to account for the effects of bracing forces on task-exertion capability...|$|R

The orthosis facilitates the functionality, being comfortable and easy to be used by the patient. It is adaptable to hand size and finger length of the patient.

50|$|The {{inherent}} {{efficiency of}} the monoplane can best be realized in the unbraced cantilever wing which carries all structural forces internally. By contrast, a braced wing has additional drag from the exposed bracing struts or wires, lowering aerodynamic efficiency. On the other <b>hand,</b> the <b>braced</b> wing has greater structural efficiency and can be made much lighter.

40|$|Repetitive {{strain injury}} remains a {{controversial}} topic. The term {{repetitive strain injury}} includes specifi c disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome, cubital tunnel syndrome, Guyon canal syndrome, lateral epicondylitis, and tendonitis of the wrist or hand. The diagnosis is usually {{made on the basis}} of history and clinical examination. Large high-quality studies using newer imaging techniques, such as MRI and ultrasonography are few. Consequently, the role of such imaging in diagnosis of upper limb disorders remains unclear. In many cases, no specifi c diagnosis can be established and complaints are labelled as non-specifi c. Little is known about the eff ectiveness of treatment options for upper limb disorders. Strong evidence for any intervention is scarce and the eff ect, if any, is mainly short-term pain relief. Exercise is benefi cial for non-specifi c upper limb disorders. Immobilising <b>hand</b> <b>braces</b> and open carpal tunnel surgery release are benefi cial for carpal tunnel syndrome, and topical and oral non-steroidal anti-infl ammatory drugs, and corticosteroid injections are helpful for lateral epicondylitis. Exercise is probably benefi cial for neck pain, as are corticosteroid injections and exercise for shoulder pain. Although upper limb disorders occur frequently in the working population, most trials have not exclusively included a working population or assessed eff ects on work-related outcomes. Further high-quality trials should aim to include suffi cient sample sizes, working populations, and work-related outcomes.
