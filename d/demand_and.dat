Based on our results we give explanations for different observations in literature and we provide ideas for the development of new approximation algorithms and heuristics for these problems. ...|$|R
40|$|This article uses a demands-and-resources {{approach}} to examine relationships between {{three types of}} work <b>demands</b> <b>and</b> work-to-family and family-to-work conflict: time-based de-mands, strain-based <b>demands,</b> <b>and</b> boundary-spanning <b>demands.</b> The analysis is {{based on data from}} 2, 155 employed adults living with a family member who were interviewed for the 1997 National Study of the Changing Workforce (NSCW). The results indicate consistent positive relationships between the three types of <b>demands</b> <b>and</b> work-to-family conflict. Strain-based demands show the strongest relationships with family-to-work conflict. In ad-dition, work-to-family conflict partially mediates relationships between several <b>demands</b> <b>and</b> family-to-work conflict. Thus, work <b>demands</b> reveal direct <b>and</b> indirect relationships with family-to-work conflict...|$|R
40|$|This study aims {{to explore}} the {{relation}} between job <b>demands</b> <b>and</b> counterproductive work behaviors (CWBs). A cross-sectional sample of 439 coal miners completed a self-report questionnaire that assessed their job demands, psychological detachment, job anxiety, and CWBs in a Chinese context. The conceptual model, based on the stressor-detachment model, was examined using structural equation modeling. The results suggest that psychological detachment mediates not only the relation between job <b>demands</b> <b>and</b> job anxiety but also that between job <b>demands</b> <b>and</b> CWBs. Furthermore, the relation between job <b>demands</b> <b>and</b> CWBs is sequentially mediated by psychological detachment and job anxiety. Our findings validate {{the effectiveness of the}} stressor-detachment model. Moreover, we demonstrate that the underlying mechanism of the relation between job <b>demands</b> <b>and</b> CWBs can be explained by psychological detachment and job anxiety...|$|R
5|$|Most {{classical}} theories, including Fisher's, {{held that}} velocity was stable and independent of economic activity. Cambridge economists, such as John Maynard Keynes, began to challenge this assumption. They developed the Cambridge cash-balance theory, which looked at money <b>demand</b> <b>and</b> how it impacted the economy. The Cambridge theory did {{not assume that}} money <b>demand</b> <b>and</b> supply were always at equilibrium, and it accounted for people holding more cash when the economy sagged. By factoring {{in the value of}} holding cash, the Cambridge economists took significant steps toward the concept of liquidity preference that Keynes would later develop. Cambridge theory argued that people hold money for two reasons: to facilitate transactions and to maintain liquidity. In later work, Keynes added a third motive, speculation, to his liquidity preference theory and built on it to create his general theory.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{economic}} theory behind congestion pricing, {{the objective of this}} policy is the use of the price mechanism to make users more aware of the costs that they impose upon one another when consuming during the peak <b>demand,</b> <b>and</b> that they should pay for the additional congestion they create, thus encouraging the redistribution of the demand in space or in time, or shifting it to the consumption of a substitute public good; for example, switching from private transport to public transport.|$|E

40|$|Orientation: Understanding the job <b>demands</b> <b>and</b> {{resources}} {{experienced by}} workers in an agricultural organisation. Research purpose: The {{objective of this}} study was to examine the validity and reliability of the Adapted Job <b>Demands</b> <b>and</b> Resources Scale (AJDRS) as well as to establish prevalent job <b>demands</b> <b>and</b> resources of employees in an agricultural organisation. Demographic differences were also investigated. Motivation of the study: The agricultural sector of any national economy plays a very important role in the overall welfare of the country. Identifying the prevalent job <b>demands</b> <b>and</b> resources in an agricultural organisation is therefore of paramount importance since the negative consequences of employees experiencing very demanding jobs with few resources have been well documented in stress literature. Research approach, design and method: A cross-sectional survey design was used. The sample consisted of 443 employees in an agricultural organisation. The AJDRS was used to measure the research variables. Main findings: The findings of this research show evidence for the factorial validity and reliability of the AJDRS. Statistical differences were found with regard to the job <b>demands</b> <b>and</b> resources experienced by employees in different positions. Practical/managerial implications: Interventions to improve the perceived job <b>demands</b> <b>and</b> resources in the organisation should focus on physical resources (equipment). Contribution/value-add: This study contributes to knowledge concerning the job <b>demands</b> <b>and</b> resources that are prevalent in an agricultural organisation in South Africa. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{emotional}} labor <b>demands</b> <b>and</b> {{their effects on}} workers has received considerable attention in recent years, with most studies concentrating on stress, burnout, satisfaction, or other affective outcomes. This study extends the literature by examining the relationship between emotional labor <b>demands</b> <b>and</b> wages at the occupational level by incorporating data on generalized work activities and work context features from the O*NET. Theories describing the expected effects of job <b>demands</b> <b>and</b> working conditions on wages are described. Results suggest that higher levels of emotional labor demands are associated with lower wage rates for jobs low in cognitive <b>demands</b> <b>and</b> higher wage rates for jobs high in cognitive demands. Implications of these findings are discussed. ...|$|R
5|$|After World War II, {{industrial}} development quickened. New technology increased farm productivity through automation of feedlots for hogs and cattle, machine milking at dairy farms, and raising chickens in large buildings. Planting became more specialized with hybridization {{of corn and}} wheat, {{and the use of}} farm machinery such as tractors and combines became the norm. University of Minnesota professor Norman Borlaug contributed to these developments as part of the Green Revolution. Suburban development accelerated due to increased postwar housing <b>demand</b> <b>and</b> convenient transportation. Increased mobility, in turn, enabled more specialized jobs.|$|E

In the present study on burnout among 816 Dutch oncology care providers, the model was extended by including, apart from quantitative demands, emotional job <b>demands</b> <b>and</b> organizational job <b>demands.</b> Moreover, the study examined the potential moderating role of three different sources of social support (colleagues, supervisor, and family) on the relationship between job <b>demands</b> <b>and</b> burnout thereby predicting a specific match between the source of social support and the type of job demand. The results showed that particularly quantitative job <b>demands</b> <b>and</b> organizational job <b>demands</b> significantly contributed to the prediction of burnout.

40|$|Job strain, {{derived from}} high {{psychological}} <b>demands</b> <b>and</b> low job control, {{is associated with}} insomnia, but information {{on the role of}} emotional <b>demands</b> <b>and</b> social support in this relationship is scarce. The aims of this study were (i) to test the association between job strain and self-reported insomnia symptoms, (ii) to evaluate the combination of emotional <b>demands</b> <b>and</b> job control regarding insomnia symptoms, and (iii) to analyze the influence of social support in these relationships. This cross-sectional study refers to a sample of nurses (N = 3, 013 and N = 3, 035 for Job Strain and Emotional demand-control model, resp.) working at public hospitals in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Data were collected through a self-report questionnaire. The prevalence of insomnia symptoms was 34. 3 %. Job strain was associated with increased odds for insomnia symptoms (OR: 2. 20); the same result was observed with the combination of emotional <b>demands</b> <b>and</b> low job control (OR: 1. 99). In both models, the inclusion of low social support combined with high <b>demands</b> <b>and</b> low job control led to increased odds for insomnia symptoms, compared to groups with high social support from coworkers and supervisors. Besides job strain, the study of emotional <b>demands</b> <b>and</b> social support are promising with regards to insomnia symptoms, particularly among nurses...|$|R

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the relation between}} work and employee health, several work stress models, e. g., the Demand-Control (DC) Model and the Effort-Reward Imbalance (ERI) Model, have been developed. Although these models focus on job <b>demands</b> <b>and</b> job resources, relatively {{little attention has been}} devoted to the combined effects of <b>demands</b> <b>and</b> resources on employee well-being. The interaction between job <b>demands</b> <b>and</b> job resources - referring to a combined effect of high job <b>demands</b> <b>and</b> low job resources that is larger than the sum of their separate effects - may be an especially powerful tool for predicting employee well-being, as there may be particular <b>demands</b> <b>and</b> resources that reinforce each other, resulting in an extra strong effect on employee well-being. However, many studies do not examine the interaction between job <b>demands</b> (demands/effort) <b>and</b> job resources (control/rewards), and the few studies that do show inconsistent results.
