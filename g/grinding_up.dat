25|$|Henrique da Rocha Lima in 1916 then {{proved that}} the {{bacterium}} Rickettsia prowazekii was the agent responsible for typhus; he named it after H. T. Ricketts and Stanislaus von Prowazek, two zoologists who had died from typhus while investigating epidemics. Once these crucial facts were recognized, Rudolf Weigl in 1930 was able to fashion a practical and effective vaccine production method by <b>grinding</b> <b>up</b> the insides of infected lice that had been drinking blood. It was, however, very dangerous to produce, and carried a high likelihood of infection {{to those who were}} working on it.|$|E
25|$|The toothless {{mouth is}} small and terminal, ending in a pointed snout. As in related {{families}} (e.g. Argentinidae), an epibranchial or crumenal organ is present behind the fourth gill arch. This organ—analogous to the gizzard—consists of a small diverticulum wherein the gill rakers insert and interdigitate {{for the purpose of}} <b>grinding</b> <b>up</b> ingested material. The living body of most species is a dark brown, covered in large, silvery imbricate scales, but these are absent in Dolichopteryx, leaving the body itself a transparent white. In all species, a variable number of dark melanophores colour the muzzle, ventral surface, and midline.|$|E

25|$|By 4000 BCE, Kentucky peoples {{exploited}} native wetland resources, creating large shell middens (trash piles, ancient landfills). Middens developed along rivers, {{but there}} is limited evidence of Archaic peoples along coastlines prior to 3000 BCE. Archaic Kentucky natives' social groups were small, consisting of a few cooperating families. The large shell middens, artifact caches, human and dog burials, and burnt clay flooring prove Archaic natives lived in permanent locations. The white-tailed deer, mussels, fish, oysters, turtles, and the elk were the dominant game animals of Archaic natives. The atlatl makes its first appearance {{on the stage of}} world history during this era. The atlatl makes it easier to chuck spears with greater velocity. Other tools Archaic natives used were grooved axes, conical and cylindrical pestles, bone awls, cannel coal beads, hammerstones, and bannerstones. Hominy holes were used too. Hominy holes were a depression worn in sandstone by grinding or pulverizing, and it was used for <b>grinding</b> <b>up</b> hickory nuts or seed.|$|E
500|$|Small {{stones are}} {{swallowed}} {{to assist in}} the <b>grinding</b> <b>up</b> and digestion of the plant material. Individual stones may weigh [...] and the birds may have as much as [...] in their gizzards at one time. They also eat charcoal, although {{the reason for this is}} unclear. Captive emus have been known to eat shards of glass, marbles, car keys, jewellery, and nuts and bolts.|$|E
500|$|Also ventriculus; gastric mill; gigerium. A {{specialized}} stomach organ {{found in}} the digestive tract of some birds constructed of thick muscular walls that is used for <b>grinding</b> <b>up</b> food, often aided by particles of stone or grit. Birds with gizzards swallow food and store it in their crop if necessary. Then the food passes into the secretory part of the stomach (called the glandular stomach, and sometimes the proventriculus or [...] "true stomach"). Food then passes into the gizzard {{where it can be}} ground with previously swallowed stones and passed back to the true stomach, and vice versa. Bird gizzards are lined with a tough layer made of a carbohydrate-protein complex called koilin, that protects the muscles in the gizzard.|$|E

2500|$|Cave Johnson's only full {{appearance}} {{to date is}} in the 2011 video game Portal 2, having been referenced by a login username in the first Portal game. His actor, J.K. Simmons, spoke original lines for various trailers for Portal 2, including at the PAX East exposition in 2011. He does not appear as himself, but instead he is heard by the player-character Chell as she traverses abandoned parts of the Aperture Science facility in pre-recorded messages that explain the area {{as well as some}} of the backstory of Aperture. In these pre-recorded messages, he is sometimes accompanied by or makes reference to his personal assistant, a woman named Caroline. As Chell progresses through this area, the messages appear to indicate a decline in Aperture as well as Cave himself. He eventually contracts a deadly illness after <b>grinding</b> <b>up</b> moon rocks, which he turns into Conversion Gel (in keeping with a previous comment that Aperture's research policy is to [...] "throw science at the wall and see what sticks") but the dust was deadly poisonous, and begins discussing the prospect of putting a person's mind inside of a computer. He indicates that if the process isn't able to be done on him before he dies to put Caroline in charge, even forcibly if necessary. This leads the player to find out Caroline is in fact the personality on which the GLaDOS computer system controlling Aperture Science's testing course is based.|$|E

6000|$|... "Not muddy, exactly," [...] rejoined Mr. Holiday, [...] "but very turbid. The turbidness {{of it is}} not mud precisely.

50|$|Glyptodonts were grazing herbivores.

6000|$|Yet more {{remarkable}} {{is the evidence}} afforded by the ancestral forms of the horse tribe which have been discovered in the American tertiaries. The family Equidae, comprising the living horse, asses, and zebras, differ widely from all other mammals in the peculiar structure of the feet, all of which terminate in a single large toe forming the hoof. They have forty teeth, the molars being formed of hard and soft material in crescentic folds, {{so as to be}} a powerful agent in <b>grinding</b> <b>up</b> hard grasses and other vegetable food. The former peculiarities depend upon modifications of the skeleton, which have been thus described by Professor Huxley:-- ...|$|E

If he goes on as he has begun, his experience {{will go a long way}} towards getting him a commission; and he will be a great deal better off than if he were <b>grinding</b> <b>up</b> for two years in England. Such a strong recommendation as I could give him would be of great value to him and, moreover, he has a claim on the ground that his father was killed on service.|$|E
60|$|Section 21. This <b>grinding</b> <b>up</b> of {{the food}} in the mouth {{invariably}} occurs in herbivorous animals, {{where there is a}} considerable amount of starch and comparatively little hydrocarbon in the food. By finely dividing the food, it ensures its intimate contact with the digestive ferment, ptyalin. In such meat-eaters as the cat and dog, where little starchy matter and much fat is taken, the saliva is, of course, of less importance, and this mastication does not occur. The cheek teeth of a dog ({Section 91}), and more so of a cat, are sharp, and used for gnawing off fragments of food, which are swallowed at once. Between the incisors and premolars of a dog come the characteristic biting teeth, or canines, absent in the rabbit.|$|E

25|$|In {{birds and}} crocodilians, the stomach {{is divided into}} two regions. Anteriorly is a narrow tubular region, the proventriculus, lined by fundic glands, and {{connecting}} the true stomach to the crop.
