In this study a numerical scheme has been developed for estimating the time variations of the <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> temperature and evaporative losses. Considering this fact that the evaporation happen in the fluid surface and the surface temperature is important parameter in this process, investigate the solution for the reducing surface temperature lead to reducing evaporation. One of the methods for reducing surface temperature is reducing effect of solar radiation on the <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> and for this aim in this study investigated effect of paint color on the evaporation loss. The results show that the absorptivity of the exterior surface paint has considerable effects on tank temperature variations and the evaporative losses accordingly. The value of annual evaporation loss for light color has 170 barrel and for dark color has 370 barrel, in order to difference of evaporation loss between good and bad paint color has 200 barrel.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 115 - 118) Declining {{land based}} oil reserves {{will require the}} development of offshore oil fields, where the greatest undiscovered potential reserves are located. As the quest turns to deeper water, new advances in technology will be {{required in order to}} utilize these remote reserves economically. Large <b>floating</b> <b>storage</b> <b>tanks,</b> often converted oil tankers, have been used as part of the development scheme for several offshore fields. These tanks eliminate the need for expensive pipelines to shore. In this paper, a new mooring system concept for such permanently moored storage vessels is presented. This mooring system, referred to as the Storage Production Terminal (SPT), maintains the <b>floating</b> <b>storage</b> vessel on location even during the worst possible storm. The SPT consists of a submerged swivel structure attached directly to the bow of a ship. Chains emanating from the swivel connect to anchors on the seafloor. Hoses connect the seabed pipeline to the swivel structure. The historical background leading to the SPT concept is presented, and existing mooring systems are described. The features and characteristics of the system are discussed. Design loads were calculated and confirmed by small scale model tests. The components of the structure, shown in a series of sketches, and their design considerations are described. A fabrication procedure and an installation procedure are proposed.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, a hybrid frequency-time domain {{simulation}} scheme {{is used to}} analyze the dynamic response of sea-wave-induced fully non-linear sloshing fluid in a <b>floating</b> oil <b>storage</b> <b>tank.</b> The hydrodynamic coefficients and wave forces are firstly obtained by a potential-theory-based three-dimensional (3 D) radiation/diffraction panel program (DIFFRACT) in frequency domain. Then, a time domain model based on frequency domain data is built upon the Cummins equations to study the corresponding simulations of tank motions. State-space models are proposed as approximate representations of the convolutions in this equation. Navier-Stokes equations are applied to simulate the nonlinear fluid sloshing in time-domain and solved using the finite difference method (FDM). The volume of fluid method (VOF) is used to track the non-linear free surface. The multi-cable mooring system is used as a sea-keeping approach. During simulation time, the sloshing model, the mooring model and the floating tank model are coupled so that the interaction between them can be considered. The simulation scheme is applied for parametric studies of the dynamic response of sea-wave-induced fully non-linear sloshing fluid in a floating rectangular tank.

50|$|In the Kraft Process, high {{alkalinity}} {{and temperature}} converts the esters and carboxylic acids in rosin into soluble sodium soaps of lignin, rosin, and fatty acids. The spent cooking liquor is called weak black liquor {{and is about}} 15% dry content. The black liquor is concentrated in a multiple effect evaporator and after the first stage the black liquor is about 20 - 30%. At this stage it is called intermediate liquor. Normally the soaps start to <b>float</b> in the <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> for the weak or intermediate liquors and are skimmed off and collected. A good soap skimming operation reduces the soap content of the black liquor down to 0.2 - 0.4% w/w of the dry residue. The collected soap is called raw rosin soap or rosinate. The raw rosin soap is then allowed to settle or is centrifuged to release {{as much as possible}} of the entrained black liquor.

Some examples of floating structure with internal liquid are: vessels with roll damping <b>tanks,</b> <b>floating</b> hydrocarbon <b>storage</b> facility, LNG tankers and etc. A <b>floating</b> oil <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> is considered in this study, which has a cuboid shaped external wall, cylinder shaped internal wall and simple structure configurations for its roof and bottom. Influence of internal liquid on the hydrostatic response of floating structures is well established and {{must be taken into}} consideration. The internal liquid reduces the stability of floating structures. The focus of this study is the influence of internal liquid on the hydrodynamic response of floating tank. Frequency domain analysis is performed with WAMIT, for partially filled tank with both solid mass and liquid. mass. By comparing the different cases, the force induced by the internal liquid on the floating tank is illustrated. Based on the WAMIT calculated radiation damping force for the external flow, Impulse Response Function (IRF) connecting frequency domain and time domain solution is constructed and the force and moment induced by internal liquid is considered as an excitation force. By assuming linear tank motion, the internal liquid induced force is related to the incoming wave by a set of force transfer functions and it is moved to the right hand side of the tank motion equation. In practice, this set of force transfer function due to internal liquid has to be combined with the wave excitation force transfer function and it is the total force transfer function (internal liquid plus wave excitation) to be imported to SIMO. SIMO time domain simulation is performed in regular waves. Motion transfer functions from WAMIT frequency domain and SIMO time domain calculations are compared and reasonable agreement is achieved...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is to get a}} better {{understanding}} of how optimal weight savings of the cylindrical shell plates in <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> can be reached using higher strength duplex material. The design criteria will be based on the requirements given by the American Petroleum Institute standards API 650 for welded <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> and API 12 B for bolted <b>storage</b> <b>tanks.</b> The expected result is that use of duplex stainless steel instead of austenitic stainless steel can reduce the weight of the material needed to build a <b>storage</b> <b>tank.</b> A comparison between welded and bolted <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> will also be included in the work to find which joining method that is preferable. Additionally, an evaluation of the software TANKTM by Intergraph will be performed. Matlab® will be used in order to perform the evaluation to compare the results. The main difference between the standards API 650 and API 12 B is that there are already given standard sizes of bolted <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> API 12 B. Therefore, only <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> up to 1   625 m 3 could be compared. When comparing <b>storage</b> <b>tank</b> sizes up to 1   625 m 3 the result is that bolted <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> require a smaller mean thickness of the cylindrical shell than welded <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> and therefore less material and total weight of the shell. If the trend continues also for larger <b>tank</b> sizes, bolted <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> will be preferable to reduce the total weight of the <b>storage</b> <b>tank.</b> By use of duplex stainless steel instead of austenitic stainless steel in <b>storage</b> <b>tanks,</b> the minimum required thickness can be reduced because of the higher strength of duplex stainless steel. This leads to a smaller mean shell thickness and therefore a reduced weight compared to <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> made of austenitic stainless steel. For most dimensions of <b>storage</b> <b>tanks,</b> duplex stainless steel is cheaper than austenitic stainless steel, but for some smaller dimensions, grade 1. 4307 (austenitic) is cheaper than LDX 2101 ® (duplex). Instability calculations have been performed for welded <b>storage</b> <b>tanks,</b> while no instability calculations have been performed for bolted <b>storage</b> <b>tanks.</b> With the wind speed 190 km/h (proposed by API 650), the welded <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> need to have wind girders to stiffen the cylindrical shell and in some cases also be anchored to the ground. Anchor is not required for large dimensions of <b>storage</b> <b>tanks.</b> The evaluation of TANKTM showed that most parameters agreed to the computed value of the same parameters in Matlab®. Why a few parameters not agrees is not fully known, therefore better explanations of the parameters used in the equations in API 650 would be preferable.

40|$|The {{proposed}} {{plant to}} convert sunlight {{and carbon dioxide}} to transportation fuels will utilize a Counter-Rotating Ring Receiver Reactor Recuperator (CR 5) to convert carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide gas and oxygen gas. The CR 5 is a solar chemical heat engine that provides an environment for the continuous reduction/oxidation of iron oxide, which allows for the reaction of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide and oxygen. The plant will contain 150 CR 5 s each attached to its own parabolic mirror dish in order to collect sunlight. A carbon dioxide feed of approximately 25, 070 kg/hr {{will be used to}} produce 9, 520 kg/hr carbon monoxide. The devices will then feed a mixture of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide gas to both a water gas shift reactor and a Fischer-Tropsch reactor. The Fischer- Tropsch reactor will use the carbon monoxide along with hydrogen gas produced from the water gas shift reactor to produce a range of hydrocarbon products following an Anderson- Schulz-Flory distribution centered around octane. The FT oil products (naphtha, gasoline, diesel, heavy ends) will be sold while the light-end products will be used to meet the utility requirements of the plant itself. The plant will be located {{in the western part of}} Texas in the Mojave Desert in order to take advantage of the high solar flux in this region. Due to the necessity of sunlight to provide energy for the CR 5 reaction, the production of carbon monoxide will only take place during daylight hours and 2 hours worth of carbon monoxide production along with an excess of 10 % of this amount will be stored in <b>floating</b> roof <b>storage</b> <b>tanks.</b> The <b>storage</b> of some extra carbon monoxide will keep the startup and shutdown production of petrol product constant as the sun rises and sets. The water gas shift reactions and Fischer- Tropsch reactors will operate for as long as carbon monoxide is available and will shut down once the carbon monoxide is depleted. Assuming a discount rate of 13 %, the project yields a -$ 5. 5 billion NPV over a 30 year time period. Based on this negative net present value, the plant proves to be economically unattractive. This result is primarily driven by high operating costs due to the high stress put on expensive catalysts that require frequent replacement as well as daily startup/shutdown costs. The largest negative economic factors in the plant projections are related to operating expenses. Specifically, the daily startup and shutdown costs associated with the CR 5, WGS and FT reactors are significant. A related factor is the replacement cost of catalysts due to the high amounts of stress associated with daily shutdown, which requires 1 the catalysts to be replaced every 5 years. <b>Storage</b> <b>tanks</b> for continuous operation were considered, which would require 134 <b>storage</b> <b>tanks</b> total. This option is potentially more economically attractive; however, continuous operation was still discounted because the cost of maintenance, piping equipment costs, and other logistical challenges associated with housing the <b>storage</b> <b>tanks.</b> In addition, this option still produces a negative NPV after 30 years. Finally, the compressor operation requires significant electricity, factoring into the economic unattractiveness of the operation of this plant. These variables all lead to a negative net present value and negative cash on hand throughout thirty years of operation. Consequently, unless technological advancements can be made to change the fundamental operations of the sunlight to transportation fuel plant, the investment is not recommended...|$|R
