25|$|On 21 November 1999, an Asian {{black bear}} killed an 18-month-old boy named Abdullah in the zoo. The child, {{who was with}} his parents, tried {{to shake hands with}} the caged animal. The bear pulled the boy into the cage and tore him apart. An angry crowd tried to kill the animal but the police intervened to bring the {{situation}} under control. Zoo officials blamed the parents for allowing the boy to touch the animal. On 8 January 2004, an attendant at the zoo was attacked by a red fox when its cage was left unlocked, causing a panic among visitors. On 9 April 2007, two stray dogs entered an <b>Indian</b> <b>peafowl</b> pen from a broken portion of a fence and managed to kill about 28 peafowl. This resulted in criticism as <b>Indian</b> <b>peafowl</b> is considered sacred in Indian subcontinent. On 10 May 2009, it was reported that a new born Macaw was stolen from the zoo. The zoo director said that someone from the zoo staff must have been responsible. On 17 January 2010, two Asian black bear cubs went missing from the zoo.|$|E
25|$|<b>Indian</b> <b>peafowl</b> {{are widely}} {{distributed}} in the wild across South Asia and protected both culturally in many areas and by law in India. Conservative estimates of the population put them at more than 100,000. Illegal poaching for meat however continues and declines have been noted in parts of India. Peafowl breed readily in captivity and as free-ranging ornamental fowl. Zoos, parks, bird-fanciers and dealers across the world maintain breeding populations that {{do not need to}} be augmented by the capture of wild birds.|$|E

40|$|Numerous larvae nf Strongyloides were {{obtained}} from the feces of a green peacock, Pavo JJluticus LINNAEUS. The bird was a young, male green peacock imported from Southeast Asia via Hong Kong into the Maruyama Zoo, Sapporo, on April 22, 1962. Clinically, the bird weakened and emaciated because of continuous diar-rhoea and anorexia since its arrival. The fecal examination disclosed the presence of Strongyloides sp. together with Heterakis sp., Capillaria sp. and a cestode species. The bird, therefore, was treated with anthelmintics; the result was reported by SAKAMOTO et al. (1964) and SAKAMOTO 968 Adult parasitic females {{were obtained}} by this treatment. The parasites at the free-living stage, rhabditiform and filariform larvae and rhabditiform adults, were obtained by the cultivation of fecal materials. The infective larvae were given orally and subcutaneously to chickens.

In isolated cases, the <b>Indian</b> <b>peafowl</b> {{has been known to}} be able to adapt to harsher climates, such as those of northern Canada. The species has been spotted by Hunters as far north as Huntsville, Ontario, thriving in its newly adapted northern climate.|$|E
25|$|Many {{very large}} birds, such as ratites, {{flamingos}} {{and the largest}} swans, are extremely difficult to band because the cost of making a band which is capable of securely fitting their strong, heavy legs is prohibitive. At the other extreme, the smaller species of river and tree kingfishers, todies and certain lories, have such narrow tarsii that no band can be securely placed around it without imposing danger to blood circulation. With some gamebirds, such as the <b>Indian</b> <b>Peafowl,</b> spurs on the legs interfere with the bands, which thus can cause injury to the birds.|$|E
25|$|The male, or peacock, is {{predominantly}} blue with a fan-like crest of spatula-tipped wire-like feathers and {{is best known}} for the long train made up of elongated upper-tail covert feathers which bear colourful eyespots. These stiff feathers are raised into a fan and quivered in a display during courtship. Despite the length and size of these covert feathers, peacocks are still capable of flight. Peahens lack the train, and have a greenish lower neck and duller brown plumage. The <b>Indian</b> <b>peafowl</b> lives mainly on the ground in open forest or on land under cultivation where they forage for berries, grains but also prey on snakes, lizards, and small rodents. Their loud calls make them easy to detect, and in forest areas often indicate the presence of a predator such as a tiger. They forage on the ground in small groups and usually try to escape on foot through undergrowth and avoid flying, though they fly into tall trees to roost.|$|E

2500|$|The ornate {{train is}} {{believed}} to be the result of sexual selection by the females. Males use their ornate trains in a courtship display: they raise the feathers into a fan and quiver them. However, recent studies have failed to find a relation between the number of displayed eyespots and mating success. Marion Petrie tested whether or not these displays signaled a male's genetic quality by studying a feral population of peafowl in Whipsnade Wildlife Park in southern England. She showed that the number of eyespots in the train predicted a male's mating success, and this success could be manipulated by cutting the eyespots off some of the male's ornate feathers. Although the removal of eyespots makes males less successful in mating, eyespot removal substantially changes the appearance of male peafowls. It is likely that females mistake these males for sub-adults, or perceive that the males are physically damaged. Moreover, in a feral peafowl population, there is little variation in the number of eyespots in adult males. It is rare for adult males to lose a significant number of eyespots. Therefore, females' selection might depend on other sexual traits of males' trains. The quality of train is an honest signal of the condition of males; peahens do select males on the basis of their plumage. A recent study on a natural population of <b>Indian</b> <b>peafowls</b> in the Shivalik area of India has proposed a [...] "high maintenance handicap" [...] theory. It states that only the fittest males can afford the time and energy to maintain a long tail. Therefore, the long train is an indicator of good body condition, which results in greater mating success. While train length seems to correlate positively with MHC diversity in males, females do not appear to use train length to choose males. A study in Japan also suggests that peahens do not choose peacocks based on their ornamental plumage, including train length, number of eyespots and train symmetry. Another study in France brings up two possible explanations for the conflicting results that exist. The first explanation is that there might be a genetic variation of the trait of interest under different geographical areas due to a founder effect and/or a genetic drift. The second explanation suggests that [...] "the cost of trait expression may vary with environmental conditions," [...] so that a trait that is indicative of a particular quality may not work in another environment.|$|R
25|$|Yala {{is one of}} the 70 Important Bird Areas (IBAs) in Sri Lanka. Of 215 {{bird species}} of the park, seven are endemic to Sri Lanka. They are Sri Lanka grey hornbill, Sri Lanka junglefowl, Sri Lanka wood pigeon, crimson-fronted barbet, black-capped bulbul, blue-tailed {{bee-eater}} and brown-capped babbler. The number of waterbirds inhabiting wetlands of Yala is 90 and half of them are migrants. Waterfowl (lesser whistling duck, garganey), cormorants (little cormorant, Indian cormorant), large waterbirds (grey heron, black-headed ibis, Eurasian spoonbill, Asian openbill, painted stork), medium-sized waders Tringa spp., and small waders Charadrius spp. are among the most common waterbirds. Black-necked stork and lesser adjutant are many of the rare birds that {{can be seen in the}} park. The migrant great white pelican and resident spot-billed pelican are also have been recorded. Other waterbirds attracted to the Yala lagoons include lesser flamingo, pelicans, and rare species such as purple heron, night herons, egrets, purple swamphen, and Oriental darter. Thousands of waterfowls migrate to the lagoons of Yala during the northeast monsoon. They are northern pintail, white-winged tern, Eurasian curlew, whimbrel, godwits, and ruddy turnstone. The visiting species mingled with residing lesser whistling duck, yellow-wattled lapwing, red-wattled lapwing, and great stone-curlew. Rock pigeon, barred buttonquail, <b>Indian</b> <b>peafowl,</b> black stork, black-winged stilt, and greater flamingo are among the other bird species. Crested serpent eagle and white-bellied sea eagle are the raptors of the park.

Among the Gondi people, the tribes classified as [...] "five-god worshippers" [...] consider the sarus crane as sacred. The meat of the sarus was considered taboo in ancient Hindu scriptures. It is widely believed that the sarus pairs for life and that death of one partner leads to the other pining to death.

40|$|The {{visual sense}} of the <b>Indian</b> blue-shouldered <b>peafowl</b> Pavo cristatus was {{investigated}} {{with respect to the}} spectral absorption characteristics of the retinal photoreceptors, the spectral transmittance of the ocular media and the topographic distribution of cells in the retinal ganglion cell layer. Microspectrophotometry revealed a single class of rod, four spectrally distinct types of single cone and a single class of double cone. In the case of the single cone types, which contained visual pigments with wavelengths of maximum absorbance (lambda(max)) at 424, 458, 505 and 567 nm, spectral filtering by the ocular media and the different cone oil droplets with which each visual pigment is associated gives predicted peak spectral sensitivities of 432, 477, 537 and 605 nm, respectively. Topographic analysis of retinal ganglion cell distribution revealed a large central area of increased cell density (at peak, 35, 609 cells mm(- 2)) with a poorly defined visual streak extending nasally. The peafowl has a calculated maximum spatial resolution (visual acuity) in the lateral visual field of 20. 6 cycles degrees(- 1). These properties of the peafowl eye are discussed with respect to its visual ecology and are compared with those of other closely related species...|$|R
5000|$|In the 1970s a {{possible}} {{resolution to the}} apparent contradiction between natural selection and sexual selection was proposed. Amotz Zahavi argued that peacocks honestly signalled the handicap of having a large and costly train.
