5|$|Neanderthals {{are known}} to have lived in caves around the Rock of Gibraltar; in 1848 the first known adult Neanderthal skull, and only the second Neanderthal fossil ever found, was {{excavated}} at Forbes' Quarry on the north face of the Rock. Had the skull been recognised <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> the species might have been named Gibraltarians rather than Neanderthals. The date of the skull is unclear but it has been attributed to around the start of the last glacial period about 50,000 years ago.|$|E
25|$|Sir Alan felt {{he could}} no longer put up with Jenny's {{exceptionally}} dishonest behaviour in recent tasks when Renaissance were sent off to the loser cafe, especially after the bribery attempt she and Michael tried to instigate was exposed <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{to the rest of the}} team, with both Nick and Margaret adding that their opinions of her had changed due to her dishonesty and poor attitude. Sir Alan subsequently fired Jenny when she returned to the boardroom, after she attempted to change the story on the Kosher chicken incident a second time so as to shift the blame on Michael and get him fired.|$|E
25|$|By contrast, {{according}} to one of Cronin's biographers, Alan Davies, the book's reception was mixed. A few of the more vociferous medical practitioners of the day took exception to one of its many messages: that a few well-heeled doctors in fashionable practices were ripping off their equally well-off patients. Some pointed to the lack of balance between criticism and praise for hard-working doctors. The majority accepted it <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> a topical novel. The press attempted to incite passions within the profession in an attempt to sell copy, while Victor Gollancz followed suit in an attempt to promote the book, all overlooking {{the fact that it was}} a work of fiction, not a scientific piece of research, and not autobiographical.|$|E

500|$|Certainly, {{the issue}} of the series' subject matter was of concern to the producers. Atkinson {{recalled}} in an interview with Michael Parkinson that the poignant ending of the final episode was in part written to counter the possibility of criticism that the subject was inappropriate for a comedy, although noted that the public accepted the series <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> Speaking during filming in 1989, he remarked that despite the 20th century setting, the trenches were particularly apt for the Blackadder series: ...|$|E

Bernie Grundman provided audio mastering, Eddy Schreyer worked on remastering, and Bill Metoyer, {{who worked on}} the band's earlier release Haunting the Chapel, acted as sound engineer. The recording featured audio effects such as the intro to [...] "Hell Awaits", a reversed recording of a demonic-sounding voice repeating [...] "Join us", ending with [...] "Welcome back". Still, Araya later stated the album had poor production quality: [...] "Nowadays, production-wise, it's so under par.

500|$|According {{to music}} critic and Bruce Springsteen biographer Dave Marsh, [...] "We Are the World" [...] was not widely {{accepted}} within the rock music community. The author {{revealed that the}} song was [...] "despised" [...] <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not: [...] "a rock record, {{a critique of the}} political policies that created the famine, a way of finding out how and why famines occur, an all-inclusive representation of the entire worldwide spectrum of post-Presley popular music". Marsh revealed that he felt some of the criticisms were right, while others were silly. He claimed that despite the sentimentality of the song, [...] "We Are the World" [...] was a large-scale pop event with serious political overtones.|$|E

However, due to legal issues, the [...] "Revenge" [...] video was taken down in mid-2015 and re-uploaded a few months later, with an original audio soundtrack placed over the same video.

500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{said the}} episode [...] "had plenty of standout bits" [...] {{but that it}} [...] "represented a major flaw" [...] and [...] "perhaps in the program as a whole", citing that [...] "here {{seems to be more}} of an emphasis on comedic 'bits' rather than comedic 'situations,' which doesn't bode well for a situation comedy." [...] He explained that [...] "The Baby Show" [...] in particular [...] "felt very disjointed, bouncing between jokes more than storylines. It even opened with a Jenna surprise-birthday segment that was funny <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> but had {{absolutely nothing to do with}} the rest of the show." [...] Canning gave the episode a 7.0 out 10 rating. TV Guides Matt Mitovich liked that Josh had a story in this episode, and said that his impression of Tracy was [...] "pretty good". He remarked that [...] "The Baby Show" [...] was [...] "a solid episode, if a bit too theme-y for my broad-sitcom liking." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} for {{the plot of}} Outlaw Star has been mixed. Churosh found that though the series features many clichés of 1990's science fiction anime, Outlaw Star manages to transcend them as well. [...] "Maybe it doesn't go anywhere that other series haven't already been", the reviewer stated. [...] "But boy, {{does it have a}} damn good time getting there." [...] Upatkoon observed that the plot [...] " [...] off with a bang at the beginning" [...] and then begins to drag. Keith Dawe of Animerica also noted this about the anime's pacing, stating that even as the first few episodes do well to begin the narrative, the show's writers rely too heavily on inertia to advance it. He went on to remark that the series suffers from [...] "unfocused scripting" [...] and that [...] "one has to endure the occasional cheesy episode to reap the rewards of a show that is clever, pragmatic and amusing". However, Dawe did regard the English script writing and voice acting, and called the over-the-top introductory narration for each episode a reminder that the show should be enjoyed <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> Owens commented that the plot will not seem very original, but that it does seem to have direction, despite said direction not being very clear.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} a somewhat positive reaction from reviewers. IGN Robert Canning was representative of this, {{and gave it}} a [...] "good" [...] rating of 7.5 out of 10: [...] "The episode as a whole was fine <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> touching on most of the hallmarks of a decent prom episode", though he [...] "was a bit let down by the final moments of the episode as [...] felt it too quickly tried to pin a happy ending on everything". He also called the drama around Rachel and Jesse and Quinn and Finn [...] "superficial stuff", a view shared by Meghan Brown of The Atlantic who said much of the drama [...] "felt shallow and forced", except for the first Kurt and Karofsky scene, which she described as [...] "painful and poignant". Brown's colleague, Kevin Fallon, stated that [...] "Like prom, this episode was Glee at its best and its worst", and MTV Aly Semigran thought that it [...] "wasn't as strong—or cohesive—as last week's 'Rumours, but said it [...] "certainly had its moments, especially some notably hilarious ones." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club wrote, [...] "If the entirety of this show were like the last 10 minutes of this episode, it just might be the best show on TV." ...|$|E
500|$|Sinclair {{himself said}} in 2005 that the C5 [...] "was early <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> People reacted {{negatively}} {{and the press}} didn't help. It was too low down and people felt insecure, hence it got bad press." [...] Sam Dawson of Classic and Sport Car Magazine described the C5 as [...] "incredibly fun to drive", suggesting that the safety concerns [...] "could have been addressed if it wasn't {{for the fact that}} it was already doomed as a national joke." [...] He noted the disconnect between the media's expectations of a serious electric car and the reality of the C5, which he called [...] "just a fun way of getting around". Professor Stuart Cole of the University of South Wales comments that the C5 suffered from the design of the roads and the attitudes of the time, which were not geared towards pedal or electric vehicles: [...] "In the days before unleaded petrol, your face would have been at the height of every exhaust pipe, and drivers weren't used to having to consider slower-moving cyclists. But with more cycle lanes, better education, and workplaces providing showers, etc., the world now is much more geared up for people looking for alternatives to the car, and hopefully will become even more so in the future." ...|$|E

2500|$|By 1830 Mary Anning {{was well}} known to the leading British geologists and fossil {{collectors}} for her ability to spot important fossils in the Jurassic limestone and shale formations around the resort town of Lyme Regis on the Dorset coast, and for her knowledge and skill in collecting, reconstructing and preparing them. [...] William Conybeare’s scientific description {{of some of the}} marine reptile fossils she had found, including the first ichthyosaur skeleton to be recognized <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> and the first two plesiosaur skeletons ever found, had created a sensation in scientific circles. William Buckland credited Anning with two key observations about certain odd fossils, that they were sometimes found in the abdominal regions of ichthyosaur skeletons, and that they often contained fossilized fish scales and bones (and sometimes the bones of small ichthyosaurs), which led him to conclude that coprolites were fossilized faeces. [...] This discovery led Buckland to write a vivid description of the Lias food chain. It was this description that motivated the geologist Henry De la Beche, who had worked with Conybeare describing the marine reptile fossils, to create a pictorial representation of life in ancient Dorset.|$|E
2500|$|After a {{brief period}} of leave in Britain during 1958, Burgess took up a further Eastern post, this time at the Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin College in Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei. Brunei had been a British {{protectorate}} since 1888, and was not to achieve independence until 1984. In the sultanate, Burgess sketched the novel that, when it was published in 1961, was to be entitled Devil of a State and, although it dealt with Brunei, for libel reasons the action had to be transposed to an imaginary East African territory similar to Zanzibar, named Dunia. In his autobiography Little Wilson and Big God (1987) Burgess wrote:"This novel was, is, about Brunei, which was renamed Naraka, Malay-Sanskrit for 'hell.' Little invention was needed to contrive a large cast of unbelievable characters and a number of interwoven plots. Though completed in 1958, the work was not published until 1961, <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> worth it was made a choice of the book society. Heinemann, my publisher, was doubtful about publishing it: it might be libellous. I had to change the setting from Brunei to an East African one. Heinemann was right to be timorous. In early 1958, The Enemy in the Blanket appeared and at once provoked a libel suit." ...|$|E
