5|$|The {{distinctness}} of the <b>Donegal</b> tradition developed due to {{the close}} relations between <b>Donegal</b> and Scotland, and the <b>Donegal</b> repertoire and style has influences from Scottish fiddle music. For example, {{in addition to the}} standard tune types such as Jigs and Reels, the <b>Donegal</b> tradition also has Highlands (influenced by the Scottish Strathspey). The distinctiveness of the <b>Donegal</b> tradition led to some conflict between <b>Donegal</b> players and representatives of the mainstream tradition when Irish traditional music was organised in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no single}} <b>Donegal</b> style but several {{distinctive}} styles. These styles traditionally come from the geographical isolated regions of <b>Donegal</b> including Inishowen, eastern <b>Donegal,</b> The Rosses and Gweedore, Croaghs, Teelin, Kilcar, Glencolmcille, Ballyshannon and Bundoran. Even with improved communications and transport, these regions still have recognisably different ways of fiddle playing. Notable deceased players of the older <b>Donegal</b> styles include Neillidh ("Neilly") Boyle, Francie Byrne, Con Cassidy,Frank Cassidy, James Byrne (1946–2008), and P.V. O'Donnell (2011). Currently living <b>Donegal</b> fiddlers, include, Vincent Campbell, John Gallagher, Paddy Glackin, Danny O'Donnell, and Tommy Peoples.|$|E

5|$|The fiddle, and {{traditional}} music in general, remained popular in <b>Donegal</b> {{not only because}} of the international coverage of certain artists but because of local pride in the music. Traditional music Seisiúns are still common place both in pubs and in houses. The <b>Donegal</b> fiddle music has been influenced by recorded music, but this is claimed to have had a positive impact on the tradition. Modern <b>Donegal</b> fiddle music is often played in concerts and recorded on albums.|$|E
5|$|Outside of the Comhaltas {{movement}} however, <b>Donegal</b> fiddling stood strong with Paddy Glackin of Ceoltorí Laighean and the Bothy Band {{and later}} Tommy Peoples {{also with the}} Bothy Band and Mairead Ni Mhaonaigh with Altan, who all drew attention and prestige to the <b>Donegal</b> tradition within folk music circles throughout Ireland.|$|E
5|$|The {{influences}} between Scotland and <b>Donegal</b> went {{both ways}} and were furthered {{by a wave}} of immigration from <b>Donegal</b> to Scotland in the 19th century (the regions share common names of dances), as {{can be heard in}} the volume of strathspeys, schottisches, marches, and Donegal's own strong piping tradition, has influenced and been influenced by music, and by the sounds, ornaments, and repertoire of the Píob Mhór, the traditional bagpipes of Ireland and Scotland. There are other differences between the <b>Donegal</b> style and the rest of Ireland. Instruments such as the tin whistle, flute, concertina and accordion were very rare in <b>Donegal</b> until modern times. Traditionally the píob mór and the fiddle were the only instruments used and the use of pipe or fiddle music was common in old wedding customs. Migrant workers carried their music to Scotland and also brought back a number of tunes of Scottish origin. The <b>Donegal</b> fiddlers may well have been the route by which Scottish tunes such as Lucy Campbell, Tarbolton Lodge (Tarbolton) and The Flagon (The Flogging Reel), that entered the Irish repertoire. These players prided themselves on their technical abilities, which included playing in higher positions (fairly uncommon among traditional Irish fiddlers), and sought out material which would demonstrate their skills.|$|E

5|$|After the Irwin {{interchange}}, the Pennsylvania Turnpike widens to six {{lanes and}} {{heads into the}} rural area west of Greensburg. Curving southeast, it reaches New Stanton; an interchange provides access to I-70, US119 and the southern terminus of PA66 (the Amos K. Hutchinson Bypass). The road narrows back to four lanes at this interchange, and I-70 forms a concurrency with I-76 on the turnpike. After New Stanton, the road winds southeast to the exit for PA31/PA711 in <b>Donegal.</b> Continuing east past <b>Donegal,</b> the turnpike crosses Laurel Hill into Somerset County.|$|E

5|$|Captain Pulteney Malcolm on <b>Donegal</b> {{attacked}} Brave directly, firing his starboard {{guns and}} then crossing Braves stern, inflicting severe damage with a raking broadside, before pulling alongside again and engaging from close range. Badly damaged, Brave surrendered. Malcolm then ordered Captain Richard Dunn in Acasta to take possession as <b>Donegal</b> moved forward to engage Jupiter. With <b>Donegal</b> alongside Jupiter, Captain Samuel Pym in Atlas abandoned his brief {{engagement with the}} French ship and steered for the melee surrounding the increasingly isolated Impérial. Taking advantage of his ship's superior speed, Malcolm pulled ahead of Jupiter and then rammed her bow, securing the ships together to prevent the French vessel from escaping. Recognising that further resistance was hopeless, Captain Gaspard Laignel surrendered immediately. Malcolm then sent 100 men on board as a prize crew and attached a towline to the French ship, just as the trailing Agamemnon finally reached the battle.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Tory Island, (also {{known as}} the Battle of <b>Donegal,</b> Battle of Lough Swilly and Warren's Action) was a naval action fought on 12 October 1798 off the north coast of Ireland. The battle contested an {{attempted}} French invasion of <b>Donegal</b> {{in support of the}} Irish Rebellion of 1798, with a French squadron under Jean-Baptiste-François Bompart facing a hastily assembled Royal Navy blockade squadron under Sir John Borlase Warren. Bompart's force had been dispatched from Brest the month before with orders to reinforce a French army under Jean Humbert which had landed two months earlier.|$|E
5|$|The {{west coast}} of Ireland, Lahinch and <b>Donegal</b> Bay in particular, have popular surfing beaches, being fully exposed to the Atlantic Ocean. <b>Donegal</b> Bay is shaped like a funnel and catches west/south-west Atlantic winds, {{creating}} good surf, especially in winter. Since just before the year 2010, Bundoran has hosted European championship surfing. Scuba diving is increasingly popular in Ireland with clear waters and large populations of sea life, particularly along the western seaboard. There are also many shipwrecks {{along the coast of}} Ireland, with some of the best wreck dives being in Malin Head and off the County Cork coast.|$|E
5|$|As {{the combat}} raged {{at the head}} of the line, the {{remainder}} of both squadrons strained to join the battle. The British eastern division under Louis reached the battling Alexandre and Spencer at 10:35, the two ships locked together to the south of the main engagement. As they passed, Canopus, <b>Donegal</b> and Atlas all raked the French ship, bringing down all of her masts and leaving her in a crippled state. Canopus then steered directly towards the battle around Impérial, as <b>Donegal</b> and Atlas turned northwest to intercept Brave and Jupiter respectively. At 11:00, Spencer followed Canopus while Alexandres crew were preoccupied with extinguishing a fire that had broken out on board. Alexandre was so badly damaged that she was unable to either escape or continue the action; she formally surrendered ten minutes later.|$|E

5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} strands to the history of fiddle playing in County <b>Donegal.</b> Perhaps the best-known and, in {{the last half of the}} twentieth century, the most influential has been that of the Doherty family. Hugh Doherty is the first known musician of this family. Born in 1790, he headed an unbroken tradition of fiddlers and pipers in the Doherty family until the death, in 1980, of perhaps the best-known <b>Donegal</b> fiddler, John Doherty. John, a travelling tinsmith, was known for his extremely precise and fast finger- and bow-work and vast repertoire, and is considered to be one of the greatest Irish fiddlers ever recorded. John's older brother, Mickey, was also recorded and, though Mickey was another of the great Irish fiddlers, his reputation has been overshadowed by John's.|$|E
