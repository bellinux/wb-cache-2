25|$|One very {{successful}} example {{of virtual reality}} therapy exposure therapy is the PTSD treatment system, Virtual Iraq. Using a <b>head</b> <b>mounted</b> display and a game pad, patients navigate a Humvee around virtual recreations of Iraq, Afghanistan, and the United States. By being safely exposed to the traumatic environments, patients learned to reduce their anxiety. According to {{a review of the}} history of Virtual Iraq, one study found that it reduced PTSD symptoms by an average of fifty percent, and disqualified over seventy-five percent of participants for PTSD after treatment.|$|E
25|$|A robotic CNC router is a {{computer}} controlled robotic arm in which the router or spindle {{is part of a}} <b>head</b> <b>mounted</b> {{to the end of the}} robot arm. The main difference between a CNC router and a robotic router is the ability to router using a 4,5 or 6-axis coordinate system because of the rotation allowed by the joints in the robot arm as well as the rotation of the head that the router spindle is mounted to. CAD/CAM software programming can be used to indicate the part location, which is usually fixed to an immobile table and clamped in place. The robotic router trimming process then follows a programmed path for router cutting to create a part from a blank or more commonly- to trim the flashing from a molded part to complete the finishing process that in the past, was a manual process.|$|E
500|$|After a bard, Marillion, composes a bawdy {{song about}} King Robert's death, Joffrey offers him {{the choice between}} losing his fingers or his tongue, with Marillion {{choosing}} to have his tongue cut out. Joffrey then leads Sansa onto a small wooden bridge {{at the top of}} a battlement and forces her to look upon the heads of her father and other Stark household members mounted on spikes. When Joffrey tells her of his plans to add Robb's head to the collection, Sansa defies him by wishing to see his own <b>head</b> <b>mounted</b> there, for which Joffrey has Ser Meryn Trant slap her. As Sansa contemplates pushing Joffrey off the bridge, she is stopped by [...] "The Hound", Sandor Clegane, who wipes the blood off her mouth and tells her to obey Joffrey for her own safety.|$|E
50|$|The {{point where}} the tripod head and the device attach is called the <b>head</b> <b>mount.</b> Most camera {{equipment}} includes a built-in female 1/4-20 receptacle, so the majority of tripod heads utilize a male 1/4-20 screw as their <b>head</b> <b>mounts.</b> Many consumer level tripod heads use the bare <b>head</b> <b>mount</b> to attach the camera, but higher end models often include a camera mounting system that is pre-attached to the <b>head</b> <b>mount.</b>|$|R

500|$|British cavalry {{were armed}} with a 1908 pattern sword; lancers were {{armed with a}} [...] lance with a steel <b>head</b> <b>mounted</b> on an ash stave. Cavalrymen were also armed with Lee–Enfield rifles, unlike their French and German counterparts, who were only armed with a shorter range carbine. As the war progressed, the cavalrymen were issued with brodie helmets, hand grenades, trench mortars, and Hotchkiss light machine guns. The {{replacement}} of the Vickers Guns with the Hotchkiss, issued one per troop, greatly increased the firepower of the cavalry regiments. Like the infantry, cavalrymen were dressed in a khaki uniform, with a service dress cap. Instead of infantry webbing, they carried their ammunition in a bandolier. The French cuirassiers, by comparison, would not have looked {{out of place in}} the Napoleonic Wars; they still wore blue and red uniforms with breast and back metal plates and plumed brass-steel helmets. While the Germans had a standard field grey uniform, their uhlans still wore Polish style czapka helmets and tunics with plastron fronts, while the hussars wore frogged jackets and the cuirassiers had steel spiked helmets.|$|E
2500|$|Laurie Anderson's tape-bow violin, an {{electronic}} instrument developed in 1977, resembles an electric violin {{but does not}} have strings. It produces sound by drawing a bow, strung with a length of recorded magnetic tape rather than hair, across a magnetic tape <b>head</b> <b>mounted</b> on the instrument where the bridge would normally be.

2500|$|A trip hammer has the <b>head</b> <b>mounted</b> {{at the end}} of a {{recumbent}} , {{hence the}} alternative name of helve hammer. [...] The choice of which type was used in a particular context may have depended on the strain that its operation imposed on the helve. [...] This was normally of wood, mounted in a cast iron ring (called the hurst) where it pivoted. [...] However, in the 19th century the heaviest helves were sometimes a single casting, incorporating the hurst.|$|E

2500|$|Services {{were held}} at a niu, a tall pole, often about 18m high, with yard-arms from which hung ropes. The first of these niu was the mast of the Lord Worsley. Members of the {{congregation}} circled the niu several times a day, chanting and touching a severed <b>head</b> <b>mounted</b> on a pole while priests conducted prayer services.

2500|$|Virtual reality (VR) is a {{technology}} which allows a user {{to interact with}} a computer-simulated environment. Most current virtual reality environments are primarily visual experiences, displayed either {{on a computer screen}} or through special or stereoscopic displays, but some simulations include additional sensory information, such as sound through speakers or headphones. In 1968, Ivan Sutherland, {{with the help of his}} student Bob Sproull, invented what is widely considered to be the first virtual reality and augmented reality (AR) <b>head</b> <b>mounted</b> display (HMD) system. It was primitive both in terms of user interface and realism, and the HMD to be worn by the user was so heavy it had to be suspended from the ceiling, and the graphics comprising the virtual environment were simple wireframe model rooms. In 1989, Jaron Lanier, the founder of VPL Research popularized the concept of virtual reality with his [...] "google n' gloves" [...] system.|$|E
60|$|Immediately Tarzan was alert. He {{lifted his}} head and sniffed the slow, jungle breeze. What was it that had {{attracted}} Numa's attention and taken him soft-footed and silent {{away from the scene}} of his discomfiture? Just as the lion disappeared among the trees beyond the clearing Tarzan caught upon the down-coming wind the explanation of his new interest--the scent spoor of man was wafted strongly to the sensitive nostrils. Caching the remainder of the deer's hind quarter in the crotch of a tree the ape-man wiped his greasy palms upon his naked thighs and swung off in pursuit of Numa. A broad, well-beaten elephant path led into the forest from the clearing. Parallel to this slunk Numa, while above him Tarzan moved through the trees, the shadow of a wraith. The savage cat and the savage man saw Numa's quarry almost simultaneously, though both had known before it came within the vision of their eyes that it was a black man. Their sensitive nostrils had told them this much and Tarzan's had told him that the scent spoor was that of a stranger--old and a male, for race and sex and age each has its own distinctive scent. It was an old man that made his way alone through the gloomy jungle, a wrinkled, dried up, little old man hideously scarred and tattooed and strangely garbed, with the skin of a hyena about his shoulders and the dried <b>head</b> <b>mounted</b> upon his grey pate. Tarzan recognized the ear-marks of the witch-doctor and awaited Numa's charge with a feeling of pleasurable anticipation, for the ape-man had no love for witch-doctors; but in the instant that Numa did charge, the white man suddenly recalled that the lion had stolen his kill a few minutes before and that revenge is sweet.|$|E
50|$|<b>Head</b> <b>mount</b> {{lights are}} used by divers who need to use both hands for other purposes. This can be {{underwater}} work by a commercial diver, or getting through tight restrictions for a cave or wreck diver. With a <b>head</b> <b>mount</b> {{there is a greater}} risk of dazzling other divers in the vicinity, as the lights move with the diver's head, and this arrangement is more appropriate for divers who work or explore alone. Helmet mounts are common for commercial work which is often monitored by a helmet mount closed circuit video camera.|$|R
