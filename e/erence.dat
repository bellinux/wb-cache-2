We also examined: 1) whether call characteristics remained stable across successive breeding seasons within two of the study populations and 2) whether call similarity was related to distance between populations. Recordings of 352 males from eight populations were analysed. Th e analyses focused on variation in 1) temporal characteristics (duration of syllables and intervals, duration of the intervals between consecutive maximal amplitude peaks within syllables, called pulse-to-pulse duration (PPD)), and 2) spectral characteristics (minimal and maximal frequency, frequencies below which 25 %, 50 % and 75 % acoustic energy of signal is distributed).

40|$|The {{notion of}} majorization arose {{as a measure}} of the {{diversity}} of the components of an n-dimensional vector (an n-tuple) and is closely related to convexity. Many of the key ideas relating to majorization were discussed in the volume entitled Inequalities by Hardy, Littlewood and Polya (1934). Only {{a relatively small number of}} researchers were inspired by it to work on questions relating to majorization. After the volume entitled Theory of Majorization and its Applications (Marshall and Olkin, 1979), they heroically had shifted the literature and endeavored to rearrange ideas in order, often provided references to multiple proofs and multiple viewpoints on key results, with reference to a variety of applied elds. For certain kinds of inequalities, the notion of majorization leads to such a theory that is sometime extremely useful and powerful for deriving inequalities. Moreover, the derivation of an inequality by methods of majorization is often very helpful both for providing a deeper understanding and for suggesting natural generalizations. Majorization theory is a key tool that allows us to transform complicated non-convex constrained optimization problems that involve matrix-valued variables into simple problems with scalar variables that can be easily solved. In this PhD thesis, we restrict our attention to results in majorization that directly involve convex functions. The theory of convex functions is a part of the general subject of convexitysince a convex function is one whose epigraph is a convex set. Nonetheless it is an important theory, which touches almost all branches of mathematics. In calculus, the mean value theorem states, roughly, that given a section of a smooth curve, there is a point on that section at which the derivative (slope) of the curve is equal (parallel) to the "average" derivative of the section. It is used to prove theorems that make global conclusions about a function on an interval starting from local hypotheses about derivatives at points of the interval. In the rst chapter some basic results about convefunctions, some other classes of convex functions and majorization theory are given. In the second chapter we prove positive semi-de nite matrices which imply exponential convexity nd log-convexity for di <b>erences</b> of majorization type results in discrete case as well as integral case. We also obtain Lypunov's and Dresher's type inequalities for these di <b>erences.</b> In this chapter both sequences and functions are monotonic and positive. We give some ean value theorems and related Cauchy means. We also show that these means are monotonic. In the third chapter we prove positive semi-de nite matrices which imply a surprising property of exponential convexity and log-convexity for di <b>erences</b> of additive and multiplicative majorization type results in discrete case. We also obtain Lypunov's and Dresher's type inequalities for these di <b>erences.</b> In this chapter we use monotonic non-negative as well as real sequences our results. We give some applications of majoration. Related Cauchy means are de ned and prove that these means are monotonic. In the fourth chapter we obtain an extension of majorization type results and extensions of weighted Favard's and Berwald's inequality when only one of function is monotonic. We prove poitive semi-de niteness of matrices generated by di <b>erences</b> deduced from majorization type results and di <b>erences</b> deduced from ighted Favard's and Berwald's inequality. This implies a surprising property of exponential convexity and log-convexity of these di <b>erences</b> which allows us to deduce Lyapunov's and Dresher's type inequalities for these di <b>erences,</b> which are improvements of majorization type results and weighted Favard's and Berwald's inequalities. Analogous Cauchy's type means, as equivalent forms of exponentially convexit and logconvexity, are also studied and the monotonicity properties are proved. In the fth chapter we obtain all results in discrete case from chapter four. We give majorization type results in the case when only one sequence is monotonic. We also give generalization of Favard's inequality, generalization of Berwald's inequality and related results. We prove positive semi-de niteness of matrices generated by di <b>erences</b> deduced from majorization type results and di <b>erences</b> deduced from weighted Favard's and Berwald's inequality which implies exponential convexity and log-convexity of these di <b>erences</b> which allow us to deduce Lyapunov's and Dresher's type inequalities for these di <b>erences.</b> We introduce new Cauchy's means as equivalent form of exponential convexity and log-convexity. In the sixth chapter we prove positive semi-de niteness of matrices generated by differences deduced from Popoviciu's inequalities which implies a surprising property of exponential convexity and log-convexity of these di <b>erences</b> which allows us to deduce Gram's, Lyapunov's and Dresher's type inequalities for these di <b>erences.</b> We introduce some mean value theorems.

40|$|Whereas {{the concept}} of race held an {{important}} place in history as {{a means by which}} to describe human variability or, more precisely, human populations, it no longer holds water within the frame of contemporary understanding. The variability of human populations evolved in a complicated manner in connection with migration to the most varied of ecological environments and climates. Random population-genetic mechanisms in small population groups have also played a major role. Despite considerable morphological and adaptational diff <b>erences,</b> humankind can be defi ned as rather genetically homogenous. The majority of people perceive the diff <b>erences</b> within a population as “racial” not by virtue of tradition alone, but also intuitively; the ability to discern “racial” diff <b>erences</b> can be explained {{as a result of the}} development of face-recognition abilities during early ontogenesis. The newborn quickly learns to distinguish the faces of close ones and acquaintances (starting with his mother's) from the crowd according to an innate schema. This creates a basis for trusting or distrusting others. These mechanisms of face recognition continue to guide us as adults, leading us to feel high or low levels of trust. One of these mechanisms is the population (or “the racial”) distinction with the eff ect of the socalled other-race-eff ect. Greater trust brought about by similarity/familiarity (and the possible genetic kinship it implies) leads to collaboration and cooperation among individuals. By contrast, lesser similarity can lead to avoiding cooperation. Associated with this is on the one hand the human tendency towards xenophobia and on the other hand the tendency to form distinct groups. This along with other aspects (speech, body decoration, etc.) could probably contribute to ethnogenesis, at least in traditional societies. Self-defi nition by means of contrast with other ethnicities could further draw attention to physical diff <b>erences</b> and could consequently support the idea that “racial” diff <b>erences</b> exist, or even justify xenophobia. ‘Racialisation’ can thus be understood as a social construct, conditioned by the need to defi ne the divide between groups in terms of diff <b>erences.</b> It is therefore, to a certain extent, possible to consider it not only psychologically, but also historically (developmentally), natural...|$|R
