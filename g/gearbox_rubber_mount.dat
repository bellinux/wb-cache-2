Experimental study of engine and cabin mounts identifies the structural behaviour of the complicated metal-net elastomeric mounts to isolate driver from {{noise and vibration}} transfer. In order to achieve the expected results, the loss factor and dynamic stiffness of engine mount is studied to provide fundamental information of the energy dissipation. A simple experimental method is presented in this project to evaluate the frequency dependent <b>rubber</b> <b>mount</b> stiffness and damping characteristics by utilizing the measured complex frequency response function from low frequency. The study shows the transition of the <b>rubber</b> <b>mount</b> stiffness from static to dynamic values. Using the experimentally estimated values of the <b>rubber</b> <b>mount</b> stiffness and damping, the dynamic response of the tested spring-mass system using a metal-net <b>rubber</b> <b>mount</b> as the elastic element can be accurately reproduced...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{hysteretic}} {{behavior of}} mechanical components permits efficient passive control of mechanical system vibrations but makes response prediction delicate {{due to their}} high non linearity. In this work, the generalized Dahl model is applied to <b>rubber</b> <b>mounts</b> used to support automotive engine cooling module. The general idea is to define an analytical model for the <b>rubber</b> <b>mount,</b> and to implement it into a global finite element model of the engine cooling module. The work presented illustrates the method on a simplified system. The <b>rubber</b> <b>mounts</b> exhibit a non-linear behavior which depends on preload and frequency. Analytical restoring force models are well adapted to simulate their behavior. An experimental investigation was conducted {{in order to identify}} the model parameters. The model considers: two envelop curves (upper and lower) which can be modeled by polynomial functions, a parameter beta that governs the transition between the compression and extension phases of the <b>rubber</b> <b>mount.</b> Based on the load-deflection hysteretic loops measured, an automated procedure was realized to extract the polynomial coefficients of the envelop curves and beta. The calculated coefficients are function of the preload and the excitation frequency. Hence, the behavior of the <b>rubber</b> <b>mounts</b> can predicted versus time. In a second time, the model identified is implemented in a finite element model of a cantilever beam supported by a <b>rubber</b> <b>mount</b> at its free end. The dynamic transient response to a forced excitation is predicted and compared to experimental results...|$|R

40|$|A simple {{experimental}} method {{is presented in}} this paper to evaluate the frequency dependent <b>rubber</b> <b>mount</b> stiffness and damping characteristics by utilizing the measured complex frequency response function from impact test and by least-squares polynomial curve fitting the data obtained from the test. The study shows the transition of the <b>rubber</b> <b>mount</b> stiffness from static to dynamic values. Using the experimentally estimated values of the <b>rubber</b> <b>mount</b> stiffness and damping, the dynamic response of the tested spring-mass system using a <b>rubber</b> <b>mount</b> as the elastic element can be accurately reproduced. In contrast, it is found that the single degree of freedom (SDOF) ideal spring-mass model using constant stiffness and damping values can only predict the response of the system accurately at resonance but not at non-resonance frequencies. The proposed method is validated by comparing its results with those obtained by using mechanical shaker excitations and those of conventional direct stiffness method using blocked transfer frequency response functions...|$|R

50|$|The {{mid-engined}} Europa used {{a modified}} version of the Chapman strut. Owing to the need to isolate the engine and transaxle from the chassis in order to reduce noise and vibration, the <b>rubber</b> <b>mounts</b> led to an excessive sideways movement of the driveshafts. In this case, sideways location of the hubs was controlled by an enlarged diagonal radius rod to the front. <b>Rubber</b> sandwich <b>mounts</b> were developed that allowed vertical movement whilst controlling lateral movement. Similar vibration problems were encountered with the Elite, but as these only had the vibration of the differential to control rather than engine vibration, it could be managed by suitable design of the <b>rubber</b> <b>mounts.</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractAs {{the usage}} of {{vehicles}} has become necessary in every person's life the automotive industries {{are in need of}} reducing the vibration forces to satisfy the customer requirements. The performance and riding comfort of the automobiles are affected due to the vibrating forces. The power plants are the one of the major sources of vibration and these vibrations are caused because of the unbalanced forces from the engine. Engine mounts are identified as the one of the major sources of vibration controllers. In this investigation, modeling and analysis of an engine <b>rubber</b> <b>mount</b> are done. The mount consists of two mild steel plates and a rubber isolator in between the plates. The modeling and assembly of <b>rubber</b> <b>mount</b> components is done using I-DEAS and finite element structural analysis and numerical investigation are made on the finite element (FE) analysis software ABAQUS. The deformations of <b>rubber</b> <b>mount</b> obtained from FE analysis are used in the Minitab to develop the mathematical model and deformations are obtained with respect to different process parameters.

50|$|During this period, the Association {{produced}} work on {{the engineering}} uses of rubber.

40|$|The {{mitigation}} of {{the vibrations}} of components and structures, {{through the use}} of <b>rubber</b> <b>mounts,</b> is a common practice in many industries, such as in automotives and aeronautics or energy. It is a very important issue, because it is a key factor not just for the fatigue life but also for matters of comfort. On the other side, these industries make extensive use of finite element models to predict the dynamic behaviour of structures. Therefore, it means that the non-linear constitutive equations of <b>rubber</b> <b>mount</b> devices need to be properly integrated into the global analytical model. The quasi-static and dynamic behaviour of these devices can be quite complex, because they are usually done by a steel cover with an elastomer inside. Experimental test campaigns are usually carried forward to characterize the quasi-static and dynamic behaviour in terms of dynamic stiffness and loss factor. The experiments are designed to determine dependency on the frequency, the dynamic amplitude, the temperature and the preload. In this paper an optimization methodology, combining hyper-elasticity, visco-elasticity and elasto-plasticity constitutive equations will be presented to obtain representative elastomeric behaviour, able to fit the experimental data in hand and to predict the <b>rubber</b> <b>mount</b> behaviour in load conditions different from those tested. The numerical results obtained are in very good agreement with the experimental data...|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{most radical}} feature {{of his car}} was the novel {{suspension}} of its six-cylinder engine so as to cut down vibration. The engine was supported on three points and rested on <b>rubber</b> <b>mounts.</b> Noise and vibration were much less. There was {{still a lot of}} movement of the engine when idling, but under a load it settled down. Although it was a great success in the Plymouth, Henry Ford did not like it. For no given reason, he just didn't like it, and that was that. I told Walter that I felt it was {{a step in the right}} direction, that it would smooth out all noises and would adapt itself to axles and springs and steering-gear mounts, which would stop the transfer of road noises into the body. Today <b>rubber</b> <b>mounts</b> are used on all cars. They are also found on electric-motor mounts, in refrigerators, radios, television sets—wherever mechanical noises are apparent, rubber is used to eliminate them. We can thank Walter Chrysler for a quieter way of life. Mr. Ford could have installed this new mount at once in the V&#8209;8, but he missed the value of it. Later Edsel and I persuaded him. <b>Rubber</b> <b>mounts</b> are now found also in doors, hinges, windshields, fenders, spring hangers, shackles, and lamps—all with the idea of eliminating squeaks and rattles." ...|$|R
