5|$|On the Eastern Front in World War II Suslov was {{a member}} of Military Council of the North Caucasian Front and led the Stavropol Krai Headquarters of the Partisan Divisions (the local guerrilla movement). According to Soviet historiography, Suslov's years as a guerrilla fighter were highly successful; however, testimonies <b>from</b> <b>participants</b> differ from the {{official}} account. These participants claim that {{there were a number of}} organisational problems which reduced their effectiveness on the battlefield. During the war, Suslov spent much of his time mobilising workers to fight against the German invaders. The guerrilla movement he led was operated by the regional party cells. During the liberation of the Northern Caucasus, Suslov maintained close contact with the Red Army.|$|E

25|$|The French chose Picot as French High Commissioner for the {{soon to be}} {{occupied}} {{territory of}} Syria and Palestine. The British appointed Sykes as Chief Political Officer to the Egyptian Expeditionary Force. On 3 April 1917, Sykes met with Lloyd George, Curzon and Hankey to receive his instructions in this regard, namely to keep the French onside while pressing for a British Palestine. First Sykes in early May and then Picot and Sykes together visited the Hejaz later in May to discuss the agreement with Faisal and Hussein. Hussein was persuaded {{to agree to a}} formula to the effect that the French would pursue the same policy in Syria as the British in Baghdad; since Hussein believed that Baghdad would be part of the Arab State, that had eventually satisfied him. Later reports <b>from</b> <b>participants</b> expressed doubts about the precise nature of the discussions {{and the degree to which}} Hussein had really been informed as to the terms of Sykes–Picot.|$|E
25|$|To {{investigate}} {{if people}} would help {{others in the}} presence of bystanders alone or when introducing an accountability cue, van Bommel set out to perform two experiments. For the first experiment, participants were invited to join an online forum. A sample of 86 students was used and in the forum participants saw their own name and the names of the other people that were online in the left upper half of the screen. To operationalize the accountability cue, participants' names were displayed in either red or black. Red (salient condition), utilized to attract attention and stand out, was used to raise public self-awareness while black (non-salient) was used for participants to have the same color as other bystanders. In random order, five different messages were presented to the participants. Each of these messages was a personal story of a person in distress. The number of responses a participant typed measured the helping behavior <b>from</b> <b>participants</b> and as expected, the results showed that names in black (non-salient condition) were linked to the bystander effect with the amount of help being 2. However, when names were in the red (salient condition), the bystander effect was reversed with the amount of help being 3. This exemplifies the role of self-awareness in the reversal of bystander effect.|$|E

2500|$|The TMAS {{scale was}} {{frequently}} {{used in the}} past, however, its use has declined over the years due to problems with the validity of this self-report measure. [...] Participants use their own judgement when answering questions, which causes internal and construct validity issues, which makes the interpretation of results difficult. Another possible reason this scale has declined in its use over the years is that researchers seemed to only get results of anxiety <b>from</b> <b>participants</b> under threat conditions and not under non-threat conditions, which again questioned the scale's validity.|$|E
2500|$|These comments, which {{probably}} represent {{the most extensive}} consultation ever with Canadians {{on the subject of}} official bilingualism, were compiled statistically by the Spicer Commission, and tend to reinforce the findings of pollsters, that Canadians are favourable towards bilingual services, but frustrated with the implementation of official languages policy. Thus, for example, nearly 80% of group discussions sponsored by the Commission produced favourable comments <b>from</b> <b>participants</b> on what the Commission's report refers to as [...] "bilingualism generally", but nearly 80% of these discussions produced negative comments on [...] "official languages policy".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the field}} of the social sciences, constructivism as an {{epistemology}} urges that researchers reflect upon the paradigms that may be underpinning their research, and {{in the light of}} this that they become more open to consider other ways of interpreting any results of the research. Furthermore, the focus is on presenting results as negotiable constructs rather than as models that aim to [...] "represent" [...] social realities more or less accurately. Norma Romm in her book Accountability in Social Research (2001) argues that social researchers can earn trust <b>from</b> <b>participants</b> and wider audiences insofar as they adopt this orientation and invite inputs from others regarding their inquiry practices and the results thereof.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} further {{investigate}} {{the reversal of}} the bystander effect, van Bommel performed a second experiment, also reported in the article, with a sample size of 111 students. Unlike the first study, they wanted all participants in the forum to be indistinguishable from other bystanders on the forum. Therefore, the manipulation of public self-awareness was induced independently from the Internet forum. The procedure was identical to the first study, with a few variations. To induce public awareness in this study, webcams were mounted on participant’s computers. Participants {{could not see the}} video feed, but to make this more salient, they asked participants before they started to check whether the camera was on by looking at a LED-indicator underneath the webcam. To make the conditions resemble each other as close as possible, they asked participants in the camera absent condition to check if the LED-indicator for Num-Lock was on. Similar to the first experiment, five different messages were presented to the participants and the number of responses a participant typed measured the helping behavior <b>from</b> <b>participants.</b> [...] Once again, the results were as expected. When the camera was not present, the bystander effect existed with the average amount of help being 1.5. However, when a camera was present, the bystander effect was reversed with the amount of help doubling to 3. That said, the findings revealed the importance of public self-awareness in the bystander effect.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2011, 19 {{soldiers}} {{participated in}} a two-week assessment of the LSAT light machine gun at Fort Benning, Georgia to demonstrate its capabilities against the M249 SAW. [...] In one test the soldiers, half armed with SAWs and half with LSATs, marched six miles in full combat gear then fired at targets to measure stress and muscle fatigue. [...] Another test had the soldiers sprint 200 yards wearing body armor and a basic load of ammunition, then rapidly engage close-range targets. [...] A third week involved soldiers of the 75th Ranger Regiment performing a squad maneuver live-fire exercise in an urban setting. [...] Feedback <b>from</b> <b>participants</b> favored the LSAT for its lighter weight and decreased recoil. [...] Soldiers remarked the LSAT had better accuracy than the M249. [...] The semi-automatic option made it more viable for room clearing. [...] One Ranger even said the LSAT performed better than the Mk 46 machine gun used by special operations forces. 15 out of 19 soldiers that participated in the assessment said they would prefer using the LSAT in combat rather than the SAW. [...] The LSAT LMG is 41 percent lighter than the [...] SAW and its ammunition volume is 12 percent less, enabling all the soldiers that maneuvered the woodland obstacle course to complete it faster when carrying it. [...] Participants also took less time to zero their machine guns when using the LSAT; one soldier failed repeatedly to accurately zero the SAW but successfully zeroed the LSAT on the first try. [...] The LMG users completed the course, on average, one minute and 11 seconds faster than SAW users due to increased mobility given by its shorter length, adjustable stock, and lighter ammo. [...] When firing, gunners felt virtually no recoil from the LSAT LMG. The eight prototype weapons fired a combined 25,000 rounds, moving its cased telescoped ammunition to technology readiness level 7.|$|E
