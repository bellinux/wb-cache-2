Methods This study investigated the relationships among adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) -stimulation test results, systemic blood pressure, and microalbuminuria in clinically-healthy dogs (n = 100), in dogs affected with naturally occurring pituitary-dependent (PDH; n = 40), or adrenal-dependent hyperadrenocorticism (ADH; n = 30). Results Mean systemic blood pressure was similar between clinically healthy dogs and dogs with HAC (p = 0. 803). However the incidence of hypertension was highest in dogs with ADH (p = 0. 017), followed by dogs with PDH, with the lowest levels in clinically healthy dogs (p = 0. 019).

Considering {{that a large}} proportion of the Brazilian population is hypertensive, obese, and sedentary, the relationship among these variables in the context of the public health system is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association among physical activity, markers of adiposity, and hypertension in adult users of the public healthcare system in the city of Bauru, S&# 227;o Paulo, Brazil. METHODS: The study was conducted in five Basic Health Units in Bauru, S&# 227;o Paulo, and consisted of 963 patients. Data were collected from habitual physical activity and previous (childhood and adolescence), education, purchasing power and anthropometric markers of overall and abdominal obesity.

40|$|ABSTRACT In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} {{relationship}} between risk factors and angiographically determined coronary artery disease for blacks and whites enrolled in the Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS). Analysis of data from the CASS registry indicated that blacks had a <b>higher</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension</b> and current cigarette smoking than did whites in CASS and that chest pain was the major reason that both blacks and whites underwent coronary angiography for suspected or proven coronary disease. The CASS data also showed that, despite high levels of risk factors and chest pain, blacks had minimal or absent coronary disease. The results of this study raise several questions. First, to what extent are blacks in CASS representative of (1) blacks in the general population and (2) blacks undergoing coronary angiography? Additionally, are risk factors for coronary artery disease different for blacks than for whites?

MethodsWe used prospective data from Ansung and Ansan cohorts (n =  10, 038) of the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study. Data from baseline (2001 – 02) to the fourth study (2007 – 08) were used. After excluding hypertensive cases at baseline, missing data, and outliers, 5560 participants were analyzed. Propensity scores for having higher plasma calcium (≥ 2. 37  mmol/L) were created for each participant. After propensity score matching (1 : 1 nearest neighbor matching within caliper), 2153 pairs were left for analysis. Factors that were significantly different between the lower and higher plasma calcium groups before matching either became nonsignificant or the difference decreased in size. ResultsUsing multivariable Cox proportional hazard models with robust standard errors accounting for clustering of matched pairs, higher plasma calcium was associated with <b>higher</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension</b> (adjusted HR, 1. 24; robust 95 %CI, 1. 07 – 1. 43).

These data clearly define overt racial differences in K+ transport which suggest that blacks have a more limited capacity to exchange intracellular sodium for extracellular K+, and a higher percentage of that exchange is dependent upon ouabain-sensitive mechanisms.

40|$|Vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF) and its {{receptor}} (VEGFR) are overexpressed {{in the majority}} of renal cell carcinomas (RCC). This characteristic has supported the rationale of targeting VEGF-driven tumour vascularization, especially in clear cell RCC. VEGF-inhibiting strategies include the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (sunitinib, axitinib, pazopanib, and sorafenib) and neutralizing antibodies such as bevacizumab. Hypertension (HT) {{is one of the most}} common adverse effects of angiogenesis inhibitors. Hypertension observed in clinical trials appears to correlate with the potency of VEGF kinase inhibitor against VEGFR- 2 : agents with higher potency are associated with a <b>higher</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension.</b> Although the exact mechanism by TKIs induce hypertension has not yet been completely clarified, two key hypotheses have been postulated. First, some studies have pointed to a VEGF inhibitors-induced decrease in nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and nitric oxide (NO) production, that can result in vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure. VEGF, mediated by PI 3 K/Akt and MAPK pathway, upregulates the endothelial nitric oxide synthase enzyme leading to up-regulation of NO production. So inhibition of signaling through the VEGF pathway would lead to a decrease in NO production, resulting in an increase in vascular resistance and blood pressure. Secondly a decrease in the number of microvascular endothelial cells and subsequent depletion of normal microvessel density (rarefaction) occurs upon VEGF signaling inhibition...|$|E
40|$|Hypertension remains {{uncontrolled}} worldwide {{despite the}} availability of several classes of antihypertensive agents. There is {{an increased risk of}} serious cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and renal events if the disease goes untreated or is poorly treated. Thus, the <b>high</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension</b> coupled with its poor control make it imperative that more effective and well-tolerated treatments that exhibit target-organ protection be developed. Vasopeptidase inhibitors are a new class of cardiovascular agents that simultaneously inhibit neutral endopeptidase and angiotensin converting enzyme. They enhance peptides with vasodilatory and possibly organ-protective properties and also inhibit the production of the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II. In preclinical studies, omapatrilat has shown blood pressure-lowering effects independent of renin status and has increased survival in an animal model of congestive heart failure. Human studies with omapatrilat, the most clinically advanced vasopeptidase inhibitor, administered orally once daily have demonstrated powerful dose-dependent reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressures, regardless of age, race, or gender. Omapatrilat is particularly effective in lowering systolic blood pressure; this article summarizes data from recent clinical trials. This drug is well tolerated, with adverse effects comparable to those of currently available antihypertensive agents.

40|$|What {{has been}} called the “metabolic {{syndrome}} ” {{is one of the great}} challenges to health care. Even at present it has assumed catastrophic proportions, but it poses an even greater threat in the future (1). Almost a century ago, several authors had observed that risk factors such as obesity (particularly visceral obesity), prediabetes or diabetes, hypertension, hyperuricemia, hyperlipidemia, and others cluster (2 – 4), but the full impact of this phenomenon has been felt only recently with the onset of widespread caloric overnutrition and physical inactivity (5). Particularly threatening are obesity and metabolic syndrome in the young—a dire perspective for health and life expectancy in future generations (5). The “renaissance” of the metabolic syndrome began with G. M. Reaven’s famous Banting lecture on insulin resistance as the basis of syndrome “X ” (6). With questionable arguments (7), it has been assumed that insulin resistance is the pathophysiological basis underlying the metabolic syndrome.

40|$|There is {{current debate}} {{regarding}} whether body weight variability {{is associated with}} cardiovascular events. Recently, high body fat percentage (BF%) {{has been shown to}} be a cardiovascular risk factor. We therefore hypothesized that BF% variability would present a stronger cardiovascular risk than body weight variability. A single-center retrospective cohort study of medical check-up examinees aged 20 years or older at baseline (2005) was performed. Examinees were followed in 2007, 2009, and 2013 - 2014. BF% variability in 2005, 2007 and 2009 was calculated as the root-mean square error (RMSE) using a simple linear regression model. Multiple logistic regression models estimated the association between BF%-RMSE and new diagnoses of cardiovascular risk factors occurring between the 2009 and 2013 - 2014 visits. In total, 11, 281 participants (mean age: 51. 3 years old, 48. 8 % were male) were included in this study. The average BF%-RMSE of our subjects was 0. 63, and the average BMI-RMSE was 0. 24. The high BF%-RMSE group (76 - 100 th percentile) had a <b>higher</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension</b> and a lower incidence of diabetes mellitus than the low BF%-RMSE group (1 - 25 th percentile). This tendency was particularly evident in male participants. BMI-RMSE was not associated with any cardiovascular risks in our study. This study indicates that body fat variability has contrasting effects on cardiovascular risk factors, while body weight variability has no significant effects...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Diabetes {{prevalence}} {{studies show}} a female preponderance, especially in developed countries. This review summarizes the epidemiologic {{evidence for a}} possible transition in sexual preponderance in Taiwan. Major epidemiologic surveys of diabetes prevalence and studies on the incidence and mortality of diabetes in Taiwan over the past decades were reviewed. Diabetes prevalence increased from 5. 1 % in 1970 to 12. 8 % in 1996 with female preponderance. However, a 3 -fold higher prevalence in men in the younger age of 19 - 44 years {{in contrast to a}} female preponderance in the older age was observed in the 1996 survey. The female preponderance could possibly be explained by a higher mortality due to higher prevalence of macrovascular complications and <b>higher</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension</b> in the diabetic men. Although overall incidence of diabetes was higher in women (218. 4 vs 187. 1 per 100, 000), age-specific incidence analyses sug-gested a higher incidence accompanied by obesity in men in the age groups below 45 years. In conclusions, increasing prevalence of diabetes with female preponderance had been observed for decades in Taiwan, which can be explained partly by the higher risk of morbidity and mortality in the diabetic men and an overall higher incidence in women of all ages. However, the sex preponderance in diabetes is expected to change from women to men rolling from the past decades to the future in Taiwan because of the increasing prevalence of obesity in the younger men...|$|E
40|$|Cyclosporine A {{is highly}} {{effective}} in severe attacks of ulcerative colitis (UC) but {{is associated with}} important adverse effects that are mainly dose dependent. Our single center, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial aimed to evaluate the additional clinical benefit of 4 mg/kg over 2 mg/kg IV cyclosporine in the acute treatment of severe UC. Primary end point was the proportion of patients with a clinical response. Secondary end points included time to response, colectomy rate, and adverse effects. Seventy-three patients were included. Day- 8 response rates were 84. 2 % (32 of 38, 4 mg/kg) and 85. 7 % (32 of 35, 2 mg/kg) after a median of 4 days in both groups. Short-term colectomy rates were 13. 1 % (4 mg/kg) and 8. 6 % (2 mg/kg). Mean cyclosporine blood levels were 237 +/- 33 in the 2 -mg/kg group and 332 +/- 43 ng/mL in the 4 -mg/kg group. Active smoking was inversely correlated with clinical response (odds ratio, 0. 06), but concomitant azathioprine or steroids were not predictive. A trend toward a <b>higher</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension</b> was observed in the 4 -mg/kg group (23. 7 % vs. 8. 6 %, 2 mg/kg, P < 0. 08). High-dose IV cyclosporine has no additional clinical benefit over low dose {{in the treatment of}} severe UC. Although we did not observe differences in adverse effects on the short term, the use of 2 mg/kg IV cyclosporine should provide an improved toxicity profile for medical treatment of severe U...|$|E
40|$|With {{the use of}} cadaver donors, {{the number}} of kidney transplantations is growing rapidly. The total number {{for the whole world}} is {{estimated}} at over 100. 000. Half of these transplantations are performed in Europe. For the Netherlands the total number of renal transplantations carried out until the end of 1985 amounts to 3. 000. Out of these 3. 000, nearly 200 involved children under 15 years of age. In the unnatural situation of allogeneic kidney transplan- I tation, where surgeons are attempting to contravene nature by inserting foreign proteins into an unwilling host, unusual compensatory host mechanisms may take place. One of these mechanisms is the development <b>of</b> post-renal transplantation <b>hypertension.</b> Although a successful renal allograft may cure hypertension, it is now recognized that there is an alarmlingly <b>high</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension</b> in transplanted patients. In this situation hypertension poses diagnostic and therapeutic problems in many patients. A variety of factors may be responsible for the genesis of blood pressure elevation in the post-transplantation period, but an analysis {{of the importance of the}} various factors is very problematic in humans. The aim of the present experiments was to develop a model in rats in which post-transplantation hypertension could be studied. This model was used to reveal the mechanisms causing the hypertension after kidney transplantation in the rat and then to find ways to prevent this post-transplantation hypertension in rats...|$|R
40|$|Because renin is an {{important}} enzyme in blood pressure regulation, we studied the possibility that an alteration {{in the structure of}} the human renin gene is genetically linked to human essential hypertension or associated with levels of plasma renin activity or blood pressure. By using specific DNA probes, we have identified four polymorphisms in the human renin gene with the restriction enzymes Taq I, HindUl, Bgl I, and Bgl II. The gene location of all of these polymorphisms except for the Bgl II polymorphism has been determined, and their frequencies were initially estimated in a population of 50 random subjects. To test the clinical significance of these polymorphisms, we studied 68 persons from a large Utah pedigree with a <b>high</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension.</b> Among nine relatives with hypertension, genetic linkage without recombina-tion was ruled out by observing several obligate recombinants. We also found no significant association of the restriction fragment length polymorphisms with quantitative measurements of sitting or standing, systolic or diastolic blood pressures, or plasma renin activity in 59 untreated members of this pedigree. Although we found no genetic linkage in this set of study subjects, the characterization of the restriction fragment length polymorphisms for the renin gene may be useful in future studies of other selected pedigrees for the presence of one or more of these t...|$|R
40|$|Renal {{structure}} and hypertension in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. Hypertension {{has been reported}} to occur in 50 to 75 percent of subjects with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) prior to the onset of marked renal insufficiency but concurrent with cystic deformation of the renal parenchyma. The present study was undertaken to examine whether the renal structural abnormalities are greater in hypertensive (HBP) versus normotensive (NBP) male and female patients with ADPKD who were matched within gender groups for age, body surface area, serum creatinine concentration (males HBP 1. 2 ± 0. 02 vs. NBP 1. 1 ± 0. 03 mg/dl, NS; females HBP 0. 9 ± 0. 03 vs. NBP 0. 9 ± 0. 02 mg/dl, NS) and creatinine clearance (males HBP 100 ± 3 vs. NBP 108 ± 3 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2, NS; females HBP 97 ± 3 vs. NBP 96 ± 2 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2, NS). Renal volume was significantly greater in the HBP compared to the NBP group (males HBP 624 ± 47 vs. NBP 390 ± 43 cm 3, P < 0. 0005; females HBP 466 ± 32 vs. NBP 338 ± 24 cm 3, P < 0. 002). Since increased renal volume is due to increased cysts, the results indicate that the early <b>high</b> <b>incidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>hypertension</b> in ADPKD correlates with the renal structural abnormalities in this disorder...|$|R
