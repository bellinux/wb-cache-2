40|$|Three-dimensional {{structures}} of detonation wave propagating in circular tube was investigated using a parallel computational code developed previously. A series of parametric study for a circular tube of a fixed diameter gave the formation {{mechanism of the}} detonation cell structures depending on pre-exponential factor, k. The unsteady results in three-dimension showed the mechanisms of the multi-cell mode of detonation wave <b>front</b> <b>structures</b> same as the two, three, four and six cell mode. The detonation cell number was increased but cell width and length were decreased with increased pre-exponential factor k. In the all multi-cell mode, the detonation wave structure and smoked-foil records on the wall are made by the moving of transverse waves. The detonation wave <b>front</b> <b>structures</b> have the regular polygon and windmill shapes periodically...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} <b>fronting</b> syntactical <b>structures</b> of Old Irish (cleft {{sentence}} and nominativus pendens, {{as well as}} ambiguous examples) and analyses instances of these in the Táin Bó Cúailnge for three factors of emphasis (topic, focus, and contrast). The hypothesis that cleft correlates to focus and nominativus pendens correlates to topic is proven correct in this corpus. Contrastive emphasis is also found very often in <b>fronted</b> <b>structures,</b> especially in cleft sentences. Ambiguous examples of noun-initial and even preposition-initial sentences are analysed in detail; possible new explanations are suggested for these structures...|$|R

The {{primary and}} {{secondary}} mirrors of on-axis three mirror anastigmatic (TMA) space camera are connected and supported by its <b>front</b> mirror-body <b>structure,</b> which affects both imaging performance and stability of the camera. In this paper, the carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) thin-walled cylinder and titanium alloy connecting rod {{have been used for}} the <b>front</b> mirror-body opto-mechanical <b>structure</b> of the long-focus on-axis and TMA space camera optical system. The <b>front</b> mirror-body component <b>structure</b> has then been optimized by finite element analysis (FEA) computing.

50|$|Primarily, this {{focussed}} on serviceability, a major drawback on {{the outgoing}} Vantage GT2.

This now allows the engine change process to be completed {{in less than an hour}} without any effect on suspension settings, unlike the old configuration, which could take upwards of four hours. The rear suspension and subframe have also been modified to aid serviceability. To increase safety, the fuel cell has been repositioned within the roll cage to reduce the risk of damage to its structure in an accident.|$|E

The proposed analysis further indicates that related doubling strategies observed in certain languages are the consequences of parallel chains that license the fronted verb (phrase) in the left periphery, and the Agree-tense-aspect features inside the proposition...|$|R
