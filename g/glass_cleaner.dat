5000|$|The Drackett company, {{manufacturers}} of Windex <b>glass</b> <b>cleaner,</b> {{was a leader}} in promoting spray bottles. Roger Drackett raised soybeans, converted the soybeans to plastic using technology purchased from Henry Ford, and was an investor in the Seaquist company, an early manufacturer of sprayers and closures. Initially, the brittle nature of early plastics required that sprayers be packaged in a cardboard box, and the sprayer inserted in the glass Windex bottle by the consumer. The cost in the manufacturing sprayers was also a factor; consumers would reuse the sprayers with bottle after bottle of <b>glass</b> <b>cleaner.</b> As plastics improved {{and the cost of}} sprayers dropped, manufacturers were able to ship products with the sprayer already in the bottle.|$|E

50|$|Fragrance {{chemicals}} {{are found in}} most cleaning products, perfumes, and personal care products. More than 3000 {{chemicals are}} used in these fragrance mixtures. The synthetic musks used in detergents accumulate in the environment and are harmful to aquatic organisms. Certain musks are possible endocrine disruptors that interfere with hormone functioning. Phthalates are a common ingredient in these fragrance mixtures found in laundry detergents and fabric softeners. These phthalates are suspected endocrine disrupters that affect reproduction rates including reduced sperm count in males. Certain <b>glass</b> <b>cleaners</b> and floor polishes contain dibutyl phthalate (DBP). The European Union classifies DBP as very toxic to aquatic organisms, posing a huge danger as these cleaners, especially the floor polishes are often rinsed down the drain and into aquatic environments.|$|R

40|$|SummaryObjectivesCleaning {{workers have}} an {{increased}} risk of asthma but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. We studied functional and biological characteristics in asthmatic cleaners and compared these to healthy cleaners. MethodsForty-two cleaners with a history of asthma and/or recent respiratory symptoms and 53 symptom-free controls were identified. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) was measured and forced spirometry with reversibility testing was performed. Total IgE, pulmonary surfactant protein D and the 16 ¬†kDa Clara Cell secretory protein were measured in blood serum. Interleukins and other cytokines, growth factors, cys-leukotrienes and 8 -isoprostane were measured in exhaled breath condensate. Information on occupational and domestic use of cleaning products was obtained in an interview. Associations between asthma status, specific characteristics and the use of cleaning products were evaluated using multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses. ResultsAsthma was associated with an 8 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) 1 ‚Äì 15 %) lower postbronchodilator FEV 1, a higher prevalence of atopy (42 % vs. 10 %) and a 2. 9 (CI 1. 5 ‚Äì 5. 6) times higher level of total IgE. Asthma status was not associated with the other respiratory biomarkers. Most irritant products and sprays were more often used by asthmatic cleaners. The use of multiuse products, <b>glass</b> <b>cleaners</b> and polishes at work was associated with higher FeNO, particularly in controls.

40|$|It was the {{objective}} of this project to provide a <b>glass</b> <b>cleaner</b> formulation for a wet wipe application with cleaning and anti-fogging properties. This <b>glass</b> <b>cleaner</b> formulation was developed for automotive glass i. e. interior of windscreens. This formulation relates to a <b>glass</b> <b>cleaner</b> with a composition comprising of: (a) a blend of amphoteric surfactants; (b) a solvent system with a combination of glycol ethers; and (c) an aqueous solvent system. This glass formulation must provide good cleaning properties while also providing good wetting and sheeting properties to assist with anti-fogging properties. The objectives were obtained using 2 specific approaches: The first was by using a blend of 2 amphoteric surfactants in an alkaline medium, allowing the glass surface to become more hydrophilic which will also assist with reduction of surface tension on the glass surface. The second was by using the glycol ethers that have good coupling properties and surface tension reducing properties. The formulation was evaluated using commercial standard test methods as per the industry. A predictive model was successfully obtained for each of the five criteria that were evaluated using the 25 formulations derived from the statistical design. There were variables and variable interactions that were antagonistic for some of the criteria which were found to be synergistic for others. To achieve satisfactory cleaning, the fogging rating had to be compromise...|$|E

40|$|Developmental {{exposure}} to phthalates {{may be associated}} with adverse health outcomes but information on the variability and predictors of urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations during pregnancy is limited. We evaluated in Spanish pregnant women (n= 391) the reproducibility of urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations and predictors of exposure. We measured mono-(4 -methyl- 7 -hydroxyoctyl) phthalate (7 -OHMMeOP), mono-(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), mono-(2 -ethyl- 5 -hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), mono-(2 -ethyl- 5 -oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), mono-(2 -ethyl- 5 -carboxypentyl) phthalate (MECPP), mono-(2 -carboxyhexyl) phthalate (MCMHP), mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP), mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP), mono-iso-butyl phthalate (MiBP) and mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) in two spot urine samples collected in the first and third pregnancy trimesters. Questionnaires on predictors and food-frequency questionnaires were administered in the first and/or third pregnancy trimesters. Using creatinine-adjusted phthalate metabolite concentrations (log 10 -trasformed) we calculated intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Linear mixed and regression models assessed the associations between predictors and phthalate metabolites. The ICCs ranged from 0. 24 to 0. 07 and were higher for MBzP, MEP, MiBP, and lower for MEOHP and MEHHP. Overweight, lower education and social class, and less frequent consumption of organic food were associated with higher levels of some phthalate metabolites. The use of household cleaning products (bleach, ammonia, <b>glass</b> <b>cleaners,</b> oven cleaning sprays and degreasing products) at least once per week during pregnancy was associated with 10 - 44 % higher urinary phthalate metabolites. Bottled-water consumption, consumption of food groups usually stored in plastic containers or cans, use of plastic containers for heating food and cosmetic use were not associated with increased concentrations of phthalate metabolites. This large study with repeated phthalate measurements suggests that, in this Spanish setting, sociodemographic and lifestyle factors and household cleaning product use are better predictors of phthalate exposure levels in pregnant women than average water and food consumption and use of plastic containers and cosmetics. status: publishe...|$|R

Investigators must be aware that {{they will need to}} tailor the following protocol for their own research objectives and tissue under study*. This method is used to detect genomic DNA deletions in tumor cells. For a more detailed discussion of applying this approach to microdissected samples, see [Allelic Loss Studies]([URL] in [Prostate MP at NCI]([URL] ### Reagents 1. DNA sample (see [Processing of Microdissected Tissue - DNA-based Analysis]([URL] - Proteinase K (Sigma) - Proteinase K buffer (0. 05 M tris-HCL, 0. 001 M EDTA, 1 % Tween 20, 0. 1 mg/ml proteinase K, pH 8. 0) - Ampli Taq Gold Buffer (Perkin Elmer) - dNTP mixture (Perkin Elmer) - Primers - DEPC-treated H 2 O - Ampli Taq Gold Polymerase (Perkin Elmer) - a- 32 P dCTP, 6000 Ci/mmol (NEN Dupont) - Formamide, 99 % (Fluka) - Bromophenol blue-Xylene cyanole (Sigma), reconstituted as directed - Gel Mix- 6 sequencing gel solution (Life Technologies) - Ammonium persulfate (Biorad) - 10 X TBE buffer (0. 89 M Tris Base, 0. 89 M Boric Acid 0. 02 M Disodium EDTA) (Advanced Biotechnologies) - Acrylease (Stratagene) - <b>Glass</b> <b>cleaner</b> (e. g., Windex, Glass Plus) - 95 % ethanol ### Equipment 1. Thermal cycler (MJ Research) - Sequencing gel electrophoresis apparatus (Gibco BRL) - High voltage power supply - Gel dryer (Life Technologies) - Glass plates, 31. 0 x 38. 5 cm (Life Technologies) - 0. 4 mm spacers (Life Technologies) - Casting boot (Life Technologies) - Shark tooth comb (Life Technologies) - Small clamps - Whatman blotting paper, 3 mm thickness - Kodak Biomax MR or AR film - Film cassette (Amersham Life Science) - Film processor ### Time Requirements 1. Gel preparation: 1. 5 - 2 hours. Polymerization requires 1 hour, but may stand overnight. - LOH reactions: 2. 5 hours (approximately 1 hour for set-up, 1. 5 for PCR) - High-resolution denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis: 1 - 3 hours. Twenty minutes for set-up. Electrophoresis time varies according to product size. - Gel drying: 1 hour - Autoradiography: 1 hour- 2 days ### Methods *TIP: Investigators must be especially careful when using this methodology to analyze archival tissue specimens. Formalin fixation in particular results in DNA that is difficult to amplify and often produces inconsistent PCR results, including artifactual allelic loss and poor amplification of large products. Therefore, when this technique is used to analyze archival samples, it is highly recommended that replicate experiments (multiple independent dissections, triplicate PCR reactions, etc.) be used to verify results*. **A: LCM and Proteinase K Treatment** 1. Obtain microdissected cells using the [LCM procedure]([URL] - *TIP: The number of cells needed to successfully perform the assay varies depending on the quality and processing conditions of the tissue samples. One thousand cells is recommended as a good starting point*. - Suspend approximately 1000 microdissected cells in 20 ¬µl proteinase K buffer. - Incubate overnight at 37 ¬∞C. **B: Prepare the Glass Plates** *TIP: Use Accuwipes for cleaning purposes, as they will not leave lint behind and are non-abrasive*. 1. Clean glass plates twice with <b>glass</b> <b>cleaner.</b> - Repeat using 95 % EtOH. - Spray small plate with Acrylease. - Spread Acrylease evenly using a circular motion. - Buff dry. - Quickly assemble the plates without touching the clean surface. - Place 0. 4 mm spacers on the edges of the larger plate. - Place the smaller glass plate on top of the larger plate and spacers. - Secure the plates with a casting boot (tape or clamps may be substituted for the casting boot). **C: Polymerize the Gel** *TIP: Acrylamide is a neurotoxin. Be sure to wear gloves and a labcoat when working with this substance*. 1. Add 480 ¬µl of 10 % ammonium persulfate to 75 ml of Gel-mix- 6. - Mix by inversion. - Hold the nozzle of the bottle {{at the corner of the}} gel cast. - Hold the gel cast at a 45 o angle to the bench and pour the gel between the plates. If bubbles get trapped between the plates, remove them by tapping the outside of the plates or by tipping the plates upright. - Insert the straight side of the comb approximately 1 cm into the gel. If bubbles are introduced at this point, remove the comb and use the teeth of the comb to sweep out small bubbles. - Clamp the top of the plates together. - Allow the gel to polymerize for at least one hour. - *TIP: The gel can be left to polymerize overnight. However, if bubbles appear, the gel has begun to separate from the plates. To minimize separation, wrap the gel in plastic film and store at 4 ¬∞C until use*. **D: PCR Reaction** *TIP: Investigators must be especially careful when using this methodology to analyze archival tissue specimens. Formalin fixation in particular results in DNA that is difficult to amplify and often produces inconsistent PCR results, including artifactual allelic loss and poor amplification of large products. If this technique is to be utilized for analysis of archival samples, we highly recommend that replicate experiments (multiple independent dissections, triplicate PCR reactions, etc.) be used to verify results*. 1. Remove reagents from the freezer before beginning the procedure. - Thaw thoroughly before use. - Prepare all reactions on ice. - Prepare the reduced cytosine mixture prior to beginning the LOH reaction setup. - Vortex all reagents, with the exception of Taq Gold Polymerase before beginning the PCR reaction setup. - Prepare 320 ¬µl reduced nucleotide mixture: ![Table 1]([URL] "Table 1 ") 3. Aliquot 1 ¬µl of each DNA sample into a separate PCR tube and set aside. - *TIP: DNA that is recovered from microdissected samples and "semi-purified" using a one-step proteinase K buffer will sometimes produce "non-specific" PCR products in addition to the true alleles. Moreover, larger alleles will sometimes amplify much less well than smaller alleles. Thus, normal-cell DNA recovered from the same tissue section as the tumor DNA serves as the best control for determining the presence or absence of allelic loss*. 4. Prepare sufficient volume of the reaction mixture in a separate tube for all reaction tubes: ![Table 2]([URL] "Table 2 ") 5. Thoroughly mix the reaction mixture by pipetting and dispense 9 ¬µl of the reaction mixture into each tube containing DNA sample. - *TIP: Be sure to mix the LOH reaction mixture with the DNA sample by pipetting. This is especially critical for DNA from microdissected samples that has been processed through a one-step proteinase K-based "purification. "* 6. Cap the reaction tubes and place them in a thermal cycler. 7. Cycle the reactions according to Tm of the specific primer set. 8. After PCR, remove the samples from the thermal cycler and dispense 2 ¬µl of formamide/dye solution (95 % formamide, 20 mM EDTA, 0. 05 % bromophenol blue, 0. 05 % xylenecyanole) into each reaction tube. 9. Store reactions at 4 ¬∞C until the gel is ready for loading. - *TIP: Investigators may want to consider the "touchdown" procedure for PCR by Don RH, Cox PT, Wainwright BJ, Baker K, Mattick JS: "Touchdown" PCR to circumvent spurious priming during gene amplification. Nucl Acids Res 19 : 4008, 1991. Advantages include*: - Much cleaner bands, since by starting with a high annealing temperature of 66 degrees and lowering 1 degree every cycle, the first PCR products are the most specific ones. - The exact same protocol can be used for all primers. **E: Finalize Gel Preparation** 1. Remove the gel from the casting boot. - Push the spacers into the gel until they are flush with the smaller glass plate to prevent the buffer from leaking during electrophoresis (spacers tend to get pushed out of the gel during polymerization). - Place the gel in the sequencing apparatus and close the buffer release valve. - Pour 500 ml of 0. 5 X TBE buffer in the upper chamber and 500 ml of 1 X TBE buffer in the lower chamber. - Remove the comb and clear bubbles from the loading area with a pipette. - Insert the teeth of the comb approximately 1 mm into the gel. - Pre-heat the gel at 1700 volts for 15 - 20 minutes. **F: Gel Loading** 1. Remove the samples from the freezer. - Denature the samples in a thermal cycler at 95 ¬∞C for 5 mins. - Remove samples from the thermal cycler and immediately place on ice, with an ice pack on top of the samples, for 1 min. - Turn off the power supply. - Adjust comb if it has been pushed out of the gel during pre-heating. - Load 4 ¬µl of each sample per well. - TIP: It is best to skip lanes to avoid contamination caused by leaking between the wells. - Run the gel at 1700 volts for 1 - 2 hours (running time based on PCR product size). **G: Separate the Gel** 1. Turn off the power supply. - Drain buffer chambers (buffer must be disposed of in a liquid radioactive waste carboy). - Remove the gel from the sequencing apparatus. - Separate the plates by removing the spacers and inserting the tips of two thin spatulas in their place. - Gently lift the spatulas until the top plate separates from the lower plate and gel. - Place Whatman paper on the gel. - Slowly peel the Whatman paper and gel off the glass plate. - Cover the gel with plastic wrap and dry on a gel dryer for 1 hour. **H: Autoradiography** 1. Remove the plastic wrap from the gel. - Place the gel in an autoradiography cassette. - Expose film 1 hour- 2 days using Kodak BioMax MR or AR film. - *TIP: Use MR film for maximum resolution of bands. An intensifying screen is useful when analyzing PCR products from small numbers of microdissected cells*. ### References 1.

The interior portion of a thermal lens is also quite soft and should only be wiped clean with a microfiber lens cloth designed specifically for cleaning glasses or goggles without scratching. Products such as Windex or other <b>glass</b> and spectacle <b>cleaners</b> should never be used, as {{they are designed to}} be used on glass rather than polycarbonate. Doing so could damage the anti-fog treatments, or compromise the integrity of the lens, putting the player at risk of serious injury.|$|R

Waste minimization principles have been combined with environmental, technical and safety requirements in a formal process design framework. The applied methodology comprises the positive identification of waste generation activities, waste segregation and quantification. The process design is evaluated {{in terms of the}} impact produced by the applied waste minimization options. In addition to material and energy assessment, the process validation is extended to include an analysis of the financial effort required for a reasonable waste management strategy. The evaluated parameters, including the financial indicators, point out that a glass melting plant developed through the usage of the applied methodology meets the required parameters of cost-effectiveness and reliability...|$|R
