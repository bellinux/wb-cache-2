5|$|Icke visited Shine four times. During {{the third}} meeting, on 29 March 1990, Icke felt {{something}} like a spider's web on his face, and Shine told him she had a message from Wang Ye Lee of the spirit world. Icke {{had been sent to}} heal the Earth, she said, and would become famous but would face opposition. The spirit world was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> ideas to him, which he would speak about to others. He would write five books in three years; in 20 years a new flying machine would allow us to go wherever we wanted and time would have no meaning; and there would be earthquakes in unusual places, because the inner earth was being destabilized by having oil taken from the seabed.|$|E

25|$|NY168 {{begins at}} a fork from NY28 (Columbia Street) {{in the village}} of Mohawk.

NY168 leaves the dense wilderness, winding southwest past Casey Road and crossing over Fulmer Creek several times. The route does not change scenery much in the first several miles, crossing an intersection with the northern terminus of Rock Hill Road (unsigned County Route135) in the Days Rock hamlet of the town of German Flatts.|$|E

Eventually discovering the Riches' secret, he now finds himself in an unholy alliance with Wayne, leveraging the truth to his selfish needs.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the policemen}} {{were not able}} to {{recognize}} where the shots were coming from. After roughly 30 minutes of gunfire, the CJNG gunmen left through the mountains' forest. Investigators {{were not able to}} confirm any casualties from the CJNG's side, but Nájera Gutiérrez de Velasco stated that it was not uncommon for organized crime members to retrieve the bodies of their fallen comrades from the battlefield to prevent authorities from investigating and identifying the corpses. He said that the suspects were probably hiding in the nearby mountains, which makes it difficult for law enforcement to conduct a thorough search of the area. Nájera Gutiérrez de Velasco admitted that one of the biggest obstacles of the investigation was understanding how the CJNG found out the exact day, time, and place the police convoy was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> through the area where they were ambushed. He believes that the CJNG had precise information on the police's journey, and does not discard the possibility that an outsider might have given the CJNG information on the police's arrangements, or that someone inside the police ranks was passing along information to them.|$|E
500|$|Among the {{accessories}} shown, {{the wings}} worn {{in the video}} were made by Jim Henson Studios and her own creative team, Haus of Gaga, created the arrows. Gaga told Access Hollywood about the shoot at Hearst Castle and the main idea behind the video: [...] "It was a great experience writing the treatment working with everyone and I was like, 'Don't touch anything, and if you knock over a sculpture I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> out!'. The intention of the video was to create something that was a true sort of road map of my journey, being an artist, a pop singer, a creative person..... It's interesting because in this video the fashion and the psychotic sort of whimsy is all happening around me and it's me almost like Alice in Wonderland going through my own rabbit hole in my brain and re-experiencing the past year of my life. Every moment that we were filming together was really joyous and really fun." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the game, it was {{revealed}} that the Oilers coaching staff was able to figure out the Chargers' coaches' signs as they signaled the play call from the sideline; this was one reason their defensive backs seemed to always be {{in the right place at}} the right time. [...] "We pretty much knew ahead of time when they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass,</b> and where they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> it." [...] said Oilers defensive coordinator Ed Biles. It was a monumental upset against the heavily favored Chargers, who had scored at least 26 points in 10 games during the season and had defeated both eventual Super Bowl teams, the Rams and Steelers, by a combined scoring margin of 75-23.|$|E

2500|$|By 1911, Nicolas Coccola {{was visiting}} the First Nations Lheidli T'enneh village at Fort George, later Prince George, {{regularly}} {{and he began}} to grow concerned over the bad influences of the railway construction workers and settlers in the nearby townsite of South Fort George, where there was a large licensed hotel. The First Nations village was a valuable property, as it had been decided that the railway was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> through Fort George. Several different concerns tried to purchase the property, among them Charles Vance Millar of the BC Express Company. Eventually the railway succeeded in negotiating for the [...] property and with Nicolas Coccola as the band's spokesman, the village was sold for $125,000 and a new reservation was built [...] north on the Fraser River. By the summer of 1913, the old First Nations village was burned and only the church was left standing.|$|E
2500|$|After seeing Armie Hammer's {{performance}} in The Social Network (2010), Guadagnino [...] "fell in love" [...] {{with him and}} cultivated his passion for Hammer and the movies he made afterwards. The director {{found him to be}} a [...] "sophisticated actor, with a great range" [...] and had him in mind for the role of Oliver. Hammer, who expressed his interest in Guadagnino's A Bigger Splash, met with the director years before the film went into production. When Hammer got the script, he almost turned down the role because of the nudity that was originally in it. [...] "I did want to pass. It scared me," [...] he said. [...] "There’s a lot of stuff here that I’ve never done on film before. But there’s no way I can’t do this, mostly because it scares me so much."

2500|$|Haussmann's {{renovation}} of Paris had many critics during his own time. [...] Some were simply {{tired of the}} continuous construction. [...] The French historian Léon Halévy wrote in 1867, [...] "the work of Monsieur Haussmann is incomparable. [...] Everyone agrees. Paris is a marvel, and M. Haussmann has done in fifteen years what a century could not have done. But that's enough for the moment. There will be a 20th century. Let's leave something for them to do." [...] Others regretted that he had destroyed a historic part of the city. The brothers Goncourt condemned the avenues that cut at right angles {{through the center of}} the old city, [...] where [...] "one could no longer feel in the world of Balzac." [...] Jules Ferry, the most vocal critic of Haussmann in the French parliament, wrote: [...] "We weep with our eyes full of tears for the old Paris, the Paris of Voltaire, of Desmoulins, the Paris of 1830 and 1848, [...] when we see the grand and intolerable new buildings, the costly confusion, the triumphant vulgarity, the awful materialism, that we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> on to our descendants." ...|$|E
