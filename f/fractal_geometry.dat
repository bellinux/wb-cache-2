Infants are carried in batik slings decorated with symbols {{designed to bring}} the child luck, and certain batik designs are reserved for brides and bridegrooms, {{as well as their}} families. Some designs are reserved for royalties, and even banned to be worn by commoners. Consequently, a person's rank could be determined by the pattern of the batik he or she wore.

Designing antenna using <b>fractal</b> <b>geometries</b> has been shown to improve several antenna features.

Recently, optimized electrode geometries {{have been shown to}} increase the efficiency of neural stimulation by increasing the variation of current density on the electrode surface. In the present work, a new family of modified <b>fractal</b> electrode <b>geometries</b> is developed to enhance the efficiency of neural stimulation. It is shown that a promising approach in increasing the neural activation function is to increase the "edginess" of the electrode surface, a concept that is explained and quantified by fractal mathematics. Rigorous finite element simulations were performed to compute electric potential produced by proposed modified <b>fractal</b> <b>geometries.</b> The activation of 256 model axons positioned around the electrodes was then quantified, showing that modified <b>fractal</b> <b>geometries</b> required a 22 % less input power while maintaining the same level of neural activation. Preliminary in vivo experiments investigating muscle evoked potentials due to median nerve stimulation showed encouraging results, supporting the feasibility of increasing neural stimulation efficiency using modified <b>fractal</b> <b>geometries...</b>|$|R

His {{informal}} and passionate style of writing and his emphasis on visual and geometric intuition (supported by the inclusion of numerous illustrations) made The <b>Fractal</b> <b>Geometry</b> of Nature accessible to non-specialists.

50|$|In sum, we {{can drop}} the {{hypothesis}} of the differentiability of space-time, keeping differential equations, provided that <b>fractal</b> <b>geometries</b> are used. With them, we can still deal with the nondifferentiable case with the tools of differential equations. This leads to a double differential equation treatment: in space-time and in scale space.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, <b>fractal</b> <b>geometries</b> {{have been}} {{explored}} in various branches {{of science and}} engineering. In antenna engineering several of these geometries have been studied due to their purported potential of realizing multi-resonant antennas. Although due to the complex nature of fractals most of these previous studies were experimental, {{there have been some}} analytical investigations on the performance of the antennas using them. One such analytical attempt was aimed at quantitatively relating fractal dimension with antenna characteristics within a single fractal set. It is however desirable to have all <b>fractal</b> <b>geometries</b> covered under one framework for antenna design and other similar applications. With this objective as the final goal, we strive in this paper to extend an earlier approach to more generalized situations, by incorporating the lacunarity of <b>fractal</b> <b>geometries</b> as a measure of its spatial distribution. Since the available measure of lacunarity was found to be inconsistent, in this paper we propose to use a new measure to quantize the fractal lacunarity. We also demonstrate the use of this new measure in uniquely explaining the behavior of dipole antennas made of generalized Koch curves and go on to show how fundamental lacunarity is in influencing electromagnetic behavior of fractal antennas. It is expected that this averaged measure of lacunarity may find applications in areas beyond antennas...|$|R

5000|$|A {{possible}} {{obstacle to}} the growth in popularity of scale relativity is that <b>fractal</b> <b>geometries</b> necessary to deal with special and general scale relativity are less well known and developed mathematically than the simple and well-known self-similar fractals. This technical difficulty may make the advanced concepts of the theory harder to learn. Physicists interested in scale relativity need to invest some time into understanding <b>fractal</b> <b>geometries.</b> The situation {{is similar to the}} need to learn non-euclidian geometries in order to work with Einstein's general relativity. Similarly, the generality and transdiciplinary nature of the theory also made Auffray and Noble comment: [...] "The scale relativity theory and tools extend the scope of current domain-specific theories, which are naturally recovered, not replaced, in the new framework. This may explain why the community of physicists has been slow to recognize its potential and even to challenge it." ...|$|R

50|$|Scale {{relativity}} hypothesizes that quantum behavior {{comes from}} the fractal nature of spacetime. Indeed, <b>fractal</b> <b>geometries</b> allow to study such non-differentiable paths. This fractal interpretation of quantum mechanics has been further specified by Abbot and Wise, showing that the paths have a fractal dimension 2. Scale relativity goes one step further by asserting that the fractality of these paths {{is a consequence of}} the fractality of space-time.|$|R

25|$|Fractal {{dimensions}} {{were first}} applied as an index characterizing complicated geometric forms {{for which the}} details seemed {{more important than the}} gross picture. For sets describing ordinary geometric shapes, the theoretical fractal dimension equals the set's familiar Euclidean or topological dimension. Thus, it is 0 for sets describing points (0-dimensional sets); 1 for sets describing lines (1-dimensional sets having length only); 2 for sets describing surfaces (2-dimensional sets having length and width); and 3 for sets describing volumes (3-dimensional sets having length, width, and height). But this changes for fractal sets. If the theoretical fractal dimension of a set exceeds its topological dimension, the set is considered to have <b>fractal</b> <b>geometry.</b>|$|E

Dynamic social network analysis is linked to a variety of methodological traditions, above and beyond systems thinking, including graph theory, traditional social network analysis in sociology, and mathematical sociology.

40|$|Digitised {{outlines}} of a serially sectioned K-feldspar grain from a Cordilleran granitoid have been analysed for their fractal dimension. Although the grain boundary outlines are not truly fractal {{in the sense}} of Mandlebrot (1982), they do show a self-similarity over a statistically definable range, and can thus be assigned a dimensional value between 1 and 2. Each grain section has fractal dimension (D) > 1, ranging from 1. 21 - 1. 30. Scatter within the data sets have been used to define separate (pseudo) fractal elements that further characterise each grain outline. The development of <b>fractal</b> <b>geometries</b> within a particular granitoid can be broadly related to crystallisation within Ab-An-Or-Qz space. For example, Cordilleran T-type granitoids that crystallise from An-rich liquids may be expected to show both Euclidean and <b>fractal</b> <b>geometries,</b> while minimum melts and 'S'-type granites that crystallise in broadly eutectic proportions will have textures dominated by (pseudo) fractal grain outlines. The non-integer values that describe grain shape may also be useful in estimating the total grain (porosity) volume within the rock...|$|R

A field study in an ancient broadleaved woodland in England showed that of five Armillaria species present in the woods, A.gallica was consistently the first to colonize tree stumps that had been coppiced the previous year. <b>Fractal</b> <b>geometry</b> {{has been used to}} model the branching patterns of the hyphae of various Armillaria species.

[...] Because the rhizomorphs form regular networks, mathematical concepts of graph theory have been employed to describe fungal growth and interpret ecological strategies, suggesting that the specific patterns of network attachments allow the fungus [...] "to respond opportunistically to spatially and temporally changing environments".|$|E
