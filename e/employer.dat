Whereas all <b>employers</b> underline the importance of financial considerations {{when it comes to their}} intention to cooperate with social services, <b>employers</b> at small companies (less than 11 employees) are especially sensitive to a more idealistic approach (“making a difference”) compared to <b>employers</b> at middle-sized (11 - 100 employees) and large companies (over 100 employees) ...|$|R

40|$|A {{look at the}} {{development}} of labor and employment law in the U. S. reveals one astonishing principle. There is an underlying assumption that <b>employers</b> own the time and activities of employees, and thus {{any change in the}} allocation of rights between <b>employers</b> and employees has to be justified against the “interference” with the rights of <b>employers.</b> For example, whenever legislation has been introduced intended to protect workers 2 ̆ 7 rights, <b>employers</b> have argued that such protections will interfere with the right of <b>employers</b> to control their employees. This argument has been successfully made many times, and it has, I argue, shaped the debate on workers 2 ̆ 7 rights. By arguing that the employees 2 ̆ 7 time and activities are <b>employers</b> 2 ̆ 7 “property,” <b>employers</b> have successfully shifted the default allocation of rights in their favor. The argument, which according to <b>employers</b> has become a truism, can be succinctly stated as follows: since <b>employers</b> “buy” the time of employees, <b>employers</b> presumptively have the right to control all aspects of the employees 2 ̆ 7 life while at work, and at times even outside of work. This argument can be found in both academic writings and in judicial opinions...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Employers</b> can {{purchase}} high quality depression products {{that provide the}} type, intensity and duration of depression care management shown to improve work outcomes sufficiently for many <b>employers</b> to achieve a return on investment. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial was to test an intervention to encourage <b>employers</b> to purchase a high quality depression product for their workforce. Methods: Twenty nine organizations recruited senior health benefit professional members representing public or private <b>employers</b> {{who had not yet}} purchased a depression product for all 100 + workers in their company. The research team used randomization blocked by company size to assign eligible <b>employers</b> to: (1) a presentation encouraging <b>employers</b> to purchase a high quality depression product accompanied by a scientifically-derived return on investment estimate, or (2) a presentation encouraging <b>employers</b> to work with their most subscribed health plan to improve depression treatment quality indicators.
