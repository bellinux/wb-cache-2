500|$|Director Stephen Williams {{described}} filming {{at the sea}} as challenging, {{since the}} waves caused cameras, lighting and the scenery where the actors were standing to be [...] "moving {{out of sync with}} one another". Williams however thought that the scenes became more realistic due to the location. The aquatic scenes took three nights to complete, and Harold Perrineau received swimming lessons in preparation. When Sawyer <b>is</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> to swim to the other platform, a shark swims past, and in an underwater shot a DHARMA Initiative insignia can briefly be seen near its back fin. This was an inside joke or [...] "easter egg," [...] {{which turned out to be}} more visible than had been intended.

[...] Lovell and Haise also seem worried. In his DVD commentary, the real Jim Lovell {{says that if}} Swigert {{had been unable to}} dock with the LM, he or Haise could have done it. He also says that Swigert was a well-trained Command Module Pilot and that no one was really worried about whether he was up to the job, but he admitted that it made a nice subplot for the film. What the astronauts were really worried about, Lovell says, was the expected rendezvous between the Lunar Module and the Command Module after Lovell and Haise left the surface of the Moon.|$|E

The split served as a license to party for Haggard, who {{spent much of the}} next decade becoming mired in alcohol and drug problems. Haggard has stated that he was in his own mid-life crisis, or [...] "male menopause," [...] around this time. He said in an interview from this period: [...] "Things that you've enjoyed for years don't seem nearly as important, and you're at war with yourself as to what's happening. [...] 'Why don't I like that anymore? [...] Why do I like this now?' And finally, I think you actually go through a biological change, you just, you become another.... Your body <b>is</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> to die and your mind doesn't agree." [...] He was briefly a heavy user of cocaine, but managed to kick the habit.

2500|$|The Creatures' {{most famous}} and long-standing chant {{is known as the}} roll call. In the top of the first inning, when the Yankees are on the field and their {{starting}} pitcher <b>is</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> to throw the first pitch, everyone in the section stands and begins clapping. After the pitch is thrown, Creature [...] "Bald" [...] Vinny Milano gestures for the crowd to calm down, then cups his hands around his mouth and shouts out the name of the center fielder (e.g.: [...] "Yo, Aaron!", for Aaron Hicks). The whole group proceeds to chant the name until there is a response, usually {{in the form of a}} wave or a point; some Yankees respond with extra enthusiasm, such as Johnny Damon (who typically dropped to one knee and pointed at the Creatures with both hands) and Nick Swisher (who came to attention, faced the Creatures, and saluted). The Creatures move through the lineup, going from the center fielder to the left fielder, right fielder, first baseman, second baseman, shortstop and third baseman, in that order. (With the exception of a few rare instances, the pitcher and the catcher are not a part of the roll call.) Anti-obscenity laws were exercised in 2007, but are not always strictly enforced; if they are able, the Creatures will turn to the right field box seats at the completion of the Roll Call and chant [...] "Box seats suck!" [...] During the days of the bleachers' no-alcohol-sales policy, fans in the right-field box seats occasionally replied with a chant of [...] "We've got beer!" [...] If the Yankees are playing the Red Sox, the intensity of the Yankees – Red Sox rivalry takes hold; the Creatures then cut the 'box seats' chant short and instead chant [...] "Boston sucks!" [...] until that dissipates. If police cut this short, the Creatures resort to chanting [...] "No fun allowed!", or nothing at all. If a non-pitcher is replaced in a defensive position, the replacement is given the same chant. Sometimes, after a long rain delay, the Creatures will start another Roll Call just for fun. Also, until the Red Sox won the World Series in , the Creatures would chant [...] "1918!" [...] and hold up signs saying [...] "CURSE OF THE BAMBINO!" [...] and pictures of Babe Ruth to remind the Red Sox of the last time they won a championship.|$|E
