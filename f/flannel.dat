The Red Sox {{switched}} to double knits midway through 1972. Only the Royals, Expos and Yankees wore <b>flannels</b> full-time during the 1972 season, and all three converted to double knits for 1973.|$|R

5|$|J. Geraint Jenkins has {{speculated that}} if a railway line had instead {{connected}} the Severn Valley to the south Wales coalfield the mid-Wales woollen industry could have been supported by demand for <b>flannel</b> from the miners, as were the woollen mills of the Teifi valley in the later part of the 19th century.|$|E
50|$|In April 2006, {{the first}} <b>Flannels</b> store in Liverpool {{opened in the}} city’s luxury {{shopping}} destination, the Metquarter. A flagship <b>Flannels</b> store was then opened in the 2008 development, Liverpool One, creating a concept store covering 20,000sq feet across three floors. The store’s cool, spacious design sets the new blueprint for <b>Flannels</b> stores featuring original pieces and Parisian antiques in a minimal contemporary setting.|$|R
50|$|<b>Flannels,</b> {{also known}} as The <b>Flannels</b> Group, is a chain of high end {{designer}} stores in the United Kingdom specialising in luxury fashion clothing, shoes and accessories for men and women. It was founded by Neil Prosser in 1976, who remains the managing director today.|$|R
5000|$|... 1994 {{marked the}} year that <b>Flannels</b> {{expanded}} into the womenswear market, opening two new shops in Manchester’s Royal Exchange Arcade. A Life store in Birmingham and an accessories store in Leeds (where a <b>Flannels</b> store had opened a year earlier in 1993) also opened in this year.|$|R
5|$|Swimming or bathing {{outdoors}} was discouraged in the Christian West, {{so there}} was little demand or need for swimming or bathing costumes until the 18th century. The bathing gown of the 18th century was a loose ankle-length full-sleeve chemise-type gown made of wool or <b>flannel</b> that retained coverage and modesty.|$|E
5|$|There were {{periods of}} renewed prosperity. The Cambrian Mills in Newtown was {{purchased}} in 1866 by the Cambrian <b>Flannel</b> Company of Newtown and Llanidloes, which modernized the factory {{so it was}} the most advanced facility in Wales and diversified into making plain and coloured flannels, shawls, whittles, hose and tweeds.|$|E
5|$|To {{supplement}} their income, {{the inhabitants of}} Milnrow entered the domestic system, producing <b>flannel</b> and woollen cloth in purpose-built weavers' cottages, some of which from the Early Modern period have survived as listed buildings. Coalmining and metalworking also flourished in this period, but the Industrial Revolution supplanted the domestic industries and converted Milnrow into an urban mill town that mass-produced textile goods in cotton mills, such as Ellenroad Ring Mill (now a museum). The Milnrow Urban District was established in 1894 and was governed thereafter by its own district council until its abolition in 1974.|$|E

5|$|Food {{is mostly}} {{selected}} by sight, even in conditions of dim light. Movement of the prey triggers a feeding response. Frogs {{have been caught}} on fish hooks baited with red <b>flannel</b> and green frogs (Rana clamitans) have been found with stomachs full of elm seeds that they had seen floating past. Toads, salamanders and caecilians also use smell to detect prey. This response is mostly secondary because salamanders have been observed to remain stationary near odoriferous prey but only feed if it moves. Cave-dwelling amphibians normally hunt by smell. Some salamanders seem to have learned to recognize immobile prey when it has no smell, even in complete darkness.|$|E
5|$|Grunge music hit the {{mainstream}} {{in the early}} 1990s with Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, and Nirvana being signed to major record labels. Grunge fashion began to break into mainstream fashion in mid-1992 for both sexes and peaked in late 1993 and early 1994. As it picked up momentum, the grunge tag was being used by shops selling expensive flannelette shirts {{to cash in on}} the trend. Ironically, the non-conformist look suddenly became a mainstream trend. In the fashion world, Marc Jacobs presented a show for Perry Ellis in 1992, featuring grunge-inspired clothing mixed with high-end fabrics. Jacobs found inspiration in the ‘realism’ of grunge streetwear; he mixed it with the luxury of fashion by sending models down the catwalk in beanies, floral dresses and silk <b>flannel</b> shirts. Unfortunately, this did not sit well with the brand owners and Jacobs was dismissed. Other designers like Anna Sui, also drew inspiration from grunge during the spring/summer 1993 season.|$|E
5|$|Images of {{the black}} swan played only a minor role in the {{development}} of Australian decorative arts between the 1890s and World War One. This was a period when Australian flora and fauna decorative motifs were widely used for the first time. Images of lyrebirds, sea horses, waratahs, <b>flannel</b> flowers, firewheels, cockatoos and palm leaves feature prominently in the work of Lucien Henry, but the only known example of his work with a black swan is in a design for a fountain. A fountain in the central courtyard of Sydney Hospital reminiscent of Henry's design includes several black swans. Australian motifs were popular in the Queen Anne Revival or Federation architectural style of the period, but the black swan is rarely seen among the kookaburras, eucalyptus leaves and rising suns.|$|E

5|$|I {{remained}} on the wreck until she went down; the suction took me down some way, and a man got hold of my leg, but I managed to kick him off and came up and struck out for some pieces of wood {{that were on the}} water and started for land, about two miles off. I was in the water about five hours, as the shore was so rocky and the surf ran so high that a great many were lost trying to land. Nearly all those that took to the water without their clothes on were taken by sharks; hundreds of them were all round us, and I saw men taken by them close to me, but as I was dressed (having on a <b>flannel</b> shirt and trousers) they preferred the others. I was not in the least hurt, and am happy to say, kept my head clear; most of the officers lost their lives from losing their presence of mind and trying to take money with them, and from not throwing off their coats. - Letter from Lieutenant J.F. Girardot, 43rd Light Infantry, to his father, 1 March 1852.|$|E
25|$|In the mid 1980s, popular trends {{included}} wool sport coats, Levi 501s, Hawaiian shirts, shell suits, hand-knit sweaters, sports shirts, hoodies, <b>flannel</b> shirts, reversible <b>flannel</b> vests, jackets {{with the}} insides quilted, nylon jackets, gold rings, spandex cycling shorts, cowboy boots, and khaki pants with jagged seams.|$|E

5000|$|In the 1990s, less {{was more}} and dressing-down was an {{acceptable}} norm. [...] For shoes, women started wearing clunky combat boots and Doc Martens. They typically wore slip dresses with <b>flannels,</b> <b>flannels</b> and ripped jeans, and plaid in layers. Low-rise and ripped, wide-legged jeans were popular. The clothing was paired with simple jewelry such as chokers and hoop earrings and dark, rich-colored lipstick. Bell-bottom jeans from the 1970s were popular again by 1995, {{along with the}} baby-doll T-shirt. [...] When <b>flannels</b> were worn, they were oversized and when it became too hot to wear them, they were tied around the waist. [...] Hairstyles included the half-up-half-down style and messy hair that made the impression nothing was done to it.|$|R

2500|$|Originally was due {{to house}} either a Selfridges or Harvey Nichols store, but was deemed {{unsuitable}} for Liverpool ONE. The third anchor unit was then split [...] - half of which is now the city's second and also its flagship branch of <b>Flannels</b> along with the first ever stand alone branch of Ermenegildo Zegna outside London. This unit operates as its own store but backs onto the far left side of <b>Flannels</b> with its own entrance, specialised staff and carrier bags {{similar to that of}} Louis Vuitton in Manchester - a store which shares a similar concept. This makes this <b>Flannels</b> more like a Department Store than a regular <b>Flannels</b> store such as seen in the Metquarter (another shopping centre within Liverpool). Stores also on this lane include Onitsuka Tiger which is again the first outside London, Croc Shop and also a Fred Perry. Other Retailers such as Muji, Simon Carter, Whistles and Mulberry are reportedly looking for possible sites in NML or the immediate area such as Hanover Street or Peters Lane.|$|R
