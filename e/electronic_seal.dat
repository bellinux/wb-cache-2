Single use seals are typically made of plastic or metal, and the used material and production technology {{is the key to}} their security level. Reusable seals are usually electronic or mechanical rather than just made from plastic, and if purely plastic, only one part is reusable. Electronic and mechanical seals are generally used for the transportation industry, with seal fixed to the back of trucks, trailers and shipping containers. A reusable mechanical or <b>electronic</b> <b>seal</b> can be fitted to the rear or loading doors, extending a cable from itself through fixing points on the doors, and when sealed generating a unique number which is logged. When the door is next opened this number changes, so it provides tamper evidence for the load.|$|E
50|$|DHL Global Forwarding was {{appointed}} by the Indian government {{to carry out a}} pilot run under the agreement. The first cargo truck {{to take advantage of the}} motor vehicle agreement was flagged off from Kolkata on 1 November 2015. The truck travelled 640 km to reach Agartala via Dhaka. Prior to the signing of the BBIN Motor Vehicle Agreement, the truck would have had to travel 1550 km through Indian territory to reach Agartala. Officials cited this as an example of the time and cost savings that the BBIN Motor Vehicle Agreement would bring. In August 2016, Bangladesh dispatched a truck carrying garments from Dhaka to New Delhi as part of a trial run of the agreement. The truck received an electronic permit to enter Indian territory through an online web-based system. Instead of having to undergo customs clearance and formalities as it would prior to the agreement, the truck was fitted with an <b>electronic</b> <b>seal</b> with a GPS tracking device.

Operational testing of both seals revealed a need for improved procedures. Both seals generally met the specified environmental operating conditions.

In particular, the pulsed YAG laser {{is an extremely}} flexible and versatile too] capable of hermetically sealing microelectronics packages containing sensitive components without damaging them. This paper presents an overview of details that must be considered for successful use of laser welding when addressing <b>electronic</b> package <b>sealing.</b> These include; metallurgical considerations such as alloy and plating selection, weld joint configuration, design of optics, use of protective gases and control of thermal distortions. The primary limitations on use of laser welding electronic for packaging applications are economic ones. The laser itself is a relatively costly device when compared to competing welding equipment. Further, the cost of consumables and repairs can be significant.

40|$|Radio {{frequency}} identification (RFID) is an auto-identification technology realised {{by radio}} waves. The {{ultimate goal of}} RFID is the item-level tagging {{of all kinds of}} products in supply chains. This goal challenges industry and academia in many aspects. Passive UHF RFID systems, when compared with other RFID systems, are believed to possess advantages in achieving that goal. However, UHF RFID systems possess two serious disadvantages: (i) the relatively large antenna size, and (ii) the sensitiveness to the metallic items on which a tag is mounted. Those two deficiencies make a large number of small size objects and metallic objects hard to tag. In addition, different applications also bring special requirements or limitations in adopting UHF RFID systems, such {{as in the case of}} a container seal, the requirement for tags to have a physical security function, and in other cases such as pallet shipping, the requirement for detecting massive numbers of items densely stacked together. Finally, of course, cost is one of the key limitations if one intends to apply his or her design down to item-level tagging commercially. Hence each of the inherent deficiencies of the system itself and the limitations caused by the application, or a combination of all or some of the deficiencies and limitations make a large number of items hard to tag and impedes the item-level tagging target. The research in this thesis aims, by antenna design and electromagnetic wave analysis, to provide feasible and affordable solutions for some of those hard-to-tag objects in UHF RFID systems, and the thesis can be divided into five parts. In detail, the first part of the thesis gives the motivations, contributions and structure of this thesis. In addition it also provides a brief introduction to RFID systems and about how they are operated, developed, classified, regulated and standardised. The second part of this thesis presents basic terminologies and design criteria in tag antenna design, transponder IC design and reader design. Factors which limit the operating range of UHF RFID systems are discussed. Following this discussion, a novel method making use of a scattering matrix for evaluating the operating range of a UHF RFID system deployed in an arbitrary environment is proposed. In the third part, concerning the meander line dipole antenna (MDA), one of the approaches to minimising tag antenna size is analysed in terms of its resonant frequency, size reduction contributors, radiation pattern and efficiency. An analytic formula for calculating the resonant frequency of an MDA on a dielectric substrate as an RFID tag antenna is established. Based on the analysis, a novel tag antenna with a physical security function (an <b>electronic</b> <b>seal)</b> for protecting shipping containers was designed and experimentally verified. The fourth part of this thesis puts emphasis on metallic item detection. The reason of why common dipole based tag antennas cannot work well in close proximity to metal is given. Previous solutions and their own demerits in solving this problem are summarised. Then, a low profile, simple structure, compact size solution is introduced via the artificial magnetic conductor concept. Furthermore, a general DVD disc contains a very thin metal layer inside for the purpose of reflecting laser. That layer may not bring many troubles in identifying a single DVD by a UHF RFID system, but if thousands of DVDs were stacked, the role the metal component plays in degrading the detection of each DVD in the stack should be investigated. An approach in detecting a large number of DVDs (up to 2000) densely stacked is thus presented. Conclusions of the work in this thesis are drawn as the last part of the thesis. Besides conclusions the last part also includes some recommendations for future work and the description of the original contributions of this thesis. The potential benefits of item-level tagging in supply chains are enormous. The existence of a large number of hard-to-tag objects is one of the main challenges in achieving item-level tagging. The studies in this thesis extend the scope of the detectable objects and this extension makes item-level tagging more realisable. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Abstract. Regulatory {{compliance}} {{in international}} trade can be enhanced by facilitating electronic exchange of trade documents to in-crease the supply chain visibility. Crucial for acceptance of the supply chain visibility concept is trust in {{the reliability of the}} data. This depends on both the integrity of information (no data is altered illicitly) and in-tegrity of the flow of goods (no goods are unknowingly added or taken away). The challenge is to determine how these concepts of integrity are interconnected. In this paper, we discuss control measures to ensure integrity of supply chain information and the related goods flow. Such controls consist of three components. First, only trusted traders take part. Second, technical control measures ensure internal consistency of the information system, i. e., the system maintains integrity constraints based on a model of the transactions taking place. Third, physical and organizational control measures mitigate the risk that events in the real world do not correspond to the reported transactions. The usefulness and adequacy of the approach is illustrated with two case studies: the use of <b>electronic</b> <b>seals</b> in the Smart-CM project, and the use of biomet-rics for authentication in the E-Link project at Schiphol Airport, the Netherlands...|$|R
