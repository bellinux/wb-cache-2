5|$|One notable {{feature of}} string theory and M-theory {{is that these}} {{theories}} require extra dimensions of spacetime for their mathematical consistency. In string theory, spacetime is ten-dimensional (nine spatial <b>dimensions,</b> <b>and</b> one time dimension), while in M-theory it is eleven-dimensional (ten spatial <b>dimensions,</b> <b>and</b> one time dimension). In order to describe real physical phenomena using these theories, one must therefore imagine scenarios in which these extra dimensions would not be observed in experiments.|$|E

40|$|Analysis of {{collagen}} {{architecture is}} essential to wound healing research. However, to date no consistent methodologies exist for quantitatively assessing dermal collagen architecture in scars. In this study, we developed a standardized approach for quantitative analysis of scar collagen morphology by confocal microscopy using fractal <b>dimension</b> <b>and</b> lacunarity analysis. Full-thickness wounds were created on adult mice, closed by primary intention, and harvested at 14 days after wounding for morphometrics and standard Fourier transform-based scar analysis as well as fractal <b>dimension</b> <b>and</b> lacunarity analysis. In addition, transmission electron microscopy {{was used to evaluate}} collagen ultrastructure. We demonstrated that fractal <b>dimension</b> <b>and</b> lacunarity analysis were superior to Fourier transform analysis in discriminating scar versus unwounded tissue in a wild-type mouse model. To fully test the robustness of this scar analysis approach, a fibromodulin-null mouse model that heals with increased scar was also used. Fractal <b>dimension</b> <b>and</b> lacunarity analysis effectively discriminated unwounded fibromodulin-null versus wild-type skin as well as healing fibromodulin-null versus wild-type wounds, whereas Fourier transform analysis failed to do so. Furthermore, fractal <b>dimension</b> <b>and</b> lacunarity data also correlated well with transmission electron microscopy collagen ultrastructure analysis, adding to their validity. These results demonstrate that fractal <b>dimension</b> <b>and</b> lacunarity are more sensitive than Fourier transform analysis for quantification of scar morphology...|$|R
