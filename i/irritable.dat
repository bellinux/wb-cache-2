5|$|Accounts {{of their}} {{marriage}} diverge widely. Frances's congenital hip dislocation left her in constant pain, and often <b>irritable.</b> The couple's temperament and interests were opposites, France's enthusiasm for politics and intellectual company contrasting with her husband's lifelong passion for shooting and his later interest in the military.|$|E
5|$|People with {{schizophrenia}} {{may have}} {{a high rate of}} <b>irritable</b> bowel syndrome but they often do not mention it unless specifically asked. Psychogenic polydipsia, or excessive fluid intake in the absence of physiological reasons to drink, is relatively common in people with schizophrenia.|$|E
5|$|The study {{demonstrated}} that two bacterial divisions, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, constitute over 90% {{of the known}} phylogenetic categories that dominate distal gut bacteria. Using the relative gene frequencies found within the gut these researchers identified 1,244 metagenomic clusters that are critically important {{for the health of}} the intestinal tract. There are two types of functions in these range clusters: housekeeping and those specific to the intestine. The housekeeping gene clusters are required in all bacteria and are often major players in the main metabolic pathways including central carbon metabolism and amino acid synthesis. The gut-specific functions include adhesion to host proteins and the harvesting of sugars from globoseries glycolipids. Patients with <b>irritable</b> bowel syndrome were shown to exhibit 25% fewer genes and lower bacterial diversity than individuals not suffering from <b>irritable</b> bowel syndrome indicating that changes in patients’ gut biome diversity may be associated with this condition.|$|E
5|$|Another medical {{study as}} part of the MetaHit (Metagenomics of the Human Intestinal Tract) project {{consisted}} of 124 individuals from Denmark and Spain consisting of healthy, overweight, and <b>irritable</b> bowel disease patients. The study attempted to categorize the depth and phylogenetic diversity of gastrointestinal bacteria. Using Illumina GA sequence data and SOAPdenovo, a de Bruijn graph-based tool specifically designed for assembly short reads, they were able to generate 6.58 million contigs greater than 500 bp for a total contig length of 10.3 Gb and a N50 length of 2.2 kb.|$|E
5|$|Back at the office, {{the staff}} have drunk {{multiple}} cups of espresso and experience a caffeine rush {{along with a}} powerful surge in office productivity. As the rush dies down, they all begin to sweat profusely, become highly <b>irritable</b> and argumentative, frantically tear up the office carpet to reveal the hardwood underneath, and try to relocate the copy machine. At five o'clock everybody leaves the office in total disarray. When Pam and Darryl arrive back from Philadelphia, they are bewildered by the sight they encounter.|$|E
5|$|Carlos and {{the women}} bury Alejandro's body in the nearby woods and, at Bree and Gabrielle's urging, make a pact to keep his death a secret. One month later, Carlos's guilt has left him <b>irritable</b> and depressed. He confesses to having {{committed}} an unspecified crime to Father Dugan (Sam McMurray), who tells him that he will only be forgiven if he turns himself in; however, Carlos decides not to follow his advice {{in order to protect}} the other people involved in the cover-up.|$|E
5|$|Friends {{and colleagues}} remembered Crawford as a cantankerous and <b>irritable</b> individual. His {{contributions}} to British archaeology, including in Antiquity and aerial archaeology, {{have been widely}} acclaimed; some have referred to {{him as one of}} the great pioneering figures in the field. His photographic archive remained of use to archaeologists into the 21st century. A biography of Crawford by Kitty Hauser was published in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Lynette {{interviews}} {{for a job}} in an advertisement firm. Her interviewer, an <b>irritable</b> woman named Nina Fletcher (Joely Fisher), is skeptical of Lynette's competence after learning that she has four children, but asks her to come back for a final interview with her boss anyway. After Tom throws out his back, Lynette is forced to bring Penny, her toddler, to the second interview. Despite these unusual circumstances, Lynette manages to impress Nina's boss, Ed Ferrara (Currie Graham), who hires her on the spot.|$|E
5|$|The series follows two half-brothers, Wirt and Greg (voiced by Elijah Wood and Collin Dean respectively), {{who become}} {{lost in a}} strange forest called the Unknown. In order {{to find their way}} home, the two must travel across the {{seemingly}} supernatural forest with the occasional help of the wandering, mysterious and elderly Woodsman (Christopher Lloyd) and Beatrice (Melanie Lynskey), an <b>irritable</b> bluebird who travels with the boys in order to find a woman called Adelaide, who can supposedly undo the curse on Beatrice and her family and show the half-brothers the way home.|$|E
5|$|Cucurbita {{have been}} used in various {{cultures}} as folk remedies. Pumpkins {{have been used}} by Native Americans to treat intestinal worms and urinary ailments. This Native American remedy was adopted by American doctors {{in the early nineteenth century}} as an anthelmintic for the expulsion of worms. In southeastern Europe, seeds of C. pepo were used to treat <b>irritable</b> bladder and benign prostatic hyperplasia. In Germany, pumpkin seed is approved for use by the Commission E, which assesses folk and herbal medicine, for irritated bladder conditions and micturition problems of prostatic hyperplasia stages 1 and 2, although the monograph published in 1985 noted a lack of pharmacological studies that could substantiate empirically found clinical activity. The FDA in the United States, on the other hand, banned the sale of all such non-prescription drugs for the treatment of prostate enlargement in 1990.|$|E
5|$|During 1946, {{the first}} full season after the war, Hammond played only 26 innings but scored 1,783 runs {{at an average of}} 84.90, topping the {{first-class}} averages for the eighth time in succession—still an English record as of 2015. At times, he began to show technical weaknesses. Captaining England to a 1–0 victory in a three-Test series against India, he scored one fifty, making 119 runs at an average of 39.66. He batted fifth in the order in the final match, as he would in four of his five remaining Tests. Gloucestershire fell to fifth in the County Championship, and Hammond, after enthusiastically making the team very competitive {{at the start of the}} season, became increasingly affected by pain, particularly in damp weather. As captain, he could be <b>irritable</b> and consciously created remoteness and division.|$|E
5|$|Himmler {{joined the}} Nazi Party (NSDAP) in August 1923; his Party number was 14,303. As {{a member of}} Röhm's {{paramilitary}} unit, Himmler {{was involved in the}} Beer Hall Putsch—an unsuccessful attempt by Hitler and the NSDAP to seize power in Munich. This event would set Himmler on a life of politics. He was questioned by the police about his role in the putsch, but was not charged because of insufficient evidence. However, he lost his job, was unable to find employment as an agronomist, and had to move in with his parents in Munich. Frustrated by these failures, he became ever more <b>irritable,</b> aggressive, and opinionated, alienating both friends and family members.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the tour with Dashboard Confessional, {{relationships}} between the band members continued to decline. The band's live shows had deteriorated, and Rob and Suptic had both threatened to quit multiple times. Matt Pryor's wife had recently given birth to their first child, and being away from his family had made him <b>irritable</b> and standoffish. After the Honda Civic tour ended, the band embarked on their world tour, including stops throughout Europe, Japan and Australia. However, their live performance hit an all-time low, with Pryor at times refusing to even sing large portions of songs.|$|E
5|$|Teams only {{averaged}} around 80 {{points per}} game {{in the years following}} the founding of the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 1946. Before the introduction of the shot clock, teams often ran out the clock by passing the ball more frequently after they established a lead in a game. If one team chose to stall, the other team (especially if behind) would often commit fouls to regain possession. This resulted in very low-scoring games with many fouls, affecting attendance by making fans <b>irritable.</b> Starting in the 1954–55 season, the NBA implemented a 24-second shot clock. If the offensive team fails to hit the rim with the ball within the allotted time, they would lose possession. This innovation resulted in much higher scoring games. All of the highest-scoring games in the NBA have happened during the shot-clock era.|$|E
5|$|That year, Dinklage also {{starred in}} several Off-Broadway productions, such as Richard III. Dinklage {{appeared}} in the Christmas comedy film Elf as Miles Finch, an <b>irritable</b> children's author who beats up Buddy Hobbs (Will Ferrell) after he mistakes him for an elf. In 2005, he starred in the short-lived CBS science fiction series Threshold and appeared as a wedding planner in the comedy film The Baxter. He also made an appearance in the adventure comedy-drama Lassie as a traveling circus performer. The film received highly positive reviews, though it did not fare well at the box office.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{opens with}} an {{introductory}} {{glimpse of the}} aquatic town of Bikini Bottom. The audience is then introduced to SpongeBob SquarePants, an ecstatic, hyperactive, and anxious young sea sponge preparing to fulfill a lifelong dream and passion by applying for a fry cook job at the underwater fast food restaurant, the Krusty Krab, to the annoyance of the restaurant's cashier and SpongeBob's <b>irritable</b> neighbor, Squidward Tentacles. SpongeBob then gets nervous and almost reconsiders applying for {{a job at the}} restaurant until his best friend, a starfish named Patrick Star, convinces him otherwise. Humored with SpongeBob's vulnerability, gullibility, and impenetrable enthusiasm and innocence, both Squidward and the restaurant's proprietor, Mr. Eugene Krabs, decide to manipulate SpongeBob, whom they secretly consider unqualified for the position, by sending him on an impossible errand to purchase a seemingly non-existent high-caliber spatula.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{had wanted}} to study for a {{doctorate}} and proceed with a career in archaeology, Buczynski was dying. He became ill with the Toxoplasma gondii parasite, which took advantage of his weakened immune system. He suffered partial paralysis on his right side as well as brain lesions, leaving him <b>irritable</b> and withdrawn, and required hospitalization. Upon release, he moved to Atlanta to be with Muto in January 1989. By this stage, he was unable to attend to basic tasks on his own, including eating and dressing himself, and required almost constant care, from both Muto and from carers based at St. Joseph Hospital. He began to talk with the hospital's Roman Catholic priest and finally decided to return to the faith of his birth, undertaking his confession of reconciliation in February. In March, his condition deteriorated, and he was admitted to the hospital, where he fell into a coma and died on the morning on Thursday, March 16.|$|E
5|$|Having {{learned the}} truth about Dexter's identity, Arthur (John Lithgow) confronts Dexter (Michael C. Hall) at the police station, where nobody else knows Arthur is the Trinity Killer. He warns Dexter to leave him alone from now on. When he leaves, Dexter follows Arthur in his car, and accidentally strikes another car on his way. Dexter follows Arthur to a bank, where he sees Arthur bring a large {{envelope}} back to his van. Dexter attacks Arthur, knocking him out and dragging him into the van, and Dexter realizes the envelope is filled with cash. Dexter plans to take Arthur's van away and kill Arthur, but he spots {{the driver of the}} car he struck earlier talking to police officers next to Dexter's car. Dexter hides the envelope and confronts the driver, who acts very <b>irritable.</b> A frustrated Dexter attacks him and is detained by the police. By the time he is released, Arthur is gone, but Dexter recovers the envelope of money.|$|E
5|$|What {{was seen}} as a failure to keep {{discipline}} on the team hurt Stengel's standing with the Yankee owners, Topping, Weiss and Webb, as did the defeat in the 1957 Series. Stengel was by then aged 67, had several times fallen asleep in the dugout, and players complained that he was growing more <b>irritable</b> with the years. Former Yankee catcher Ralph Houk, who had been successful as a minor league manager and was Stengel's first base coach, was seen by ownership as the next manager of the Yankees. Stengel's contract, his fifth two-year deal, was up after the 1958 season. As ownership debated whether to renew it, the Yankees led by as many as 17 games, and won the pennant by 10. The Braves were the opponent in the 1958 World Series. The Braves won three of the first four games, but the Yankees, backed by the pitching of Bob Turley (who got two wins and a save in the final three games) stormed back to win the Series. Firing Stengel under such circumstances was not possible, and ownership gave him another two-year contract, to expire after the 1960 season.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} game, the Xbox {{exclusive}} Halo 4, Cortana wakes the Chief when forces from an Ex-Covenant splinter faction attack {{the remains of}} the UNSC Forward Unto Dawn, then crashes with him on Requiem. Over the course of the game, Cortana begins showing strange signs and behavior: vocal and graphic glitches, irrational behavior and a tendency to become <b>irritable</b> or angered. Their cause is soon revealed: Cortana's operation beyond her seven-year lifespan and her interaction with the Halo installations and the Flood have caused her to become Rampant, a state of over-knowledge that makes AIs 'think' themselves to death. Helped by the Master Chief and kept safe from the captain of the Infinity, who wishes to delete her, she helps in the battle against the Didact, a rogue Forerunner who hates humans, and stops his scheme to convert all of humanity into his mechanical Promethean army using the Composer. In doing so, she has to fragment her various rampant personalities and upload them into the system, which first brings down the shields around the central core, then enables her to save Master Chief from the Didact. In a final act of love, she shields the Master Chief when he destroys the Composer, then, using the last of her energy to manifest as a solid hologram, she bids a final farewell to the Chief, managing to touch him for the first time.|$|E

25|$|Occurrence in {{patients}} identified to be suffering symptoms of <b>irritable</b> bowel syndrome is not higher than occurrence {{in the normal}} population. However, due to the similarity in symptoms, patients with fructose malabsorption often fit the profile of those with <b>irritable</b> bowel syndrome. In some cases, fructose malabsorption {{may be caused by}} several diseases which cause an intestinal damage, such as celiac disease.|$|E
25|$|<b>Irritable</b> bowel {{syndrome}} (C1) is {{more specifically}} defined as pain associated with change in bowel habit, which {{is different from}} functional diarrhea.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the terms mentioned above, <b>irritable</b> hip has historically been termed transitory coxitis, coxitis fugax, acute transient epiphysitis, coxitis serosa seu simplex, phantom hip disease and observation hip.|$|E
25|$|No {{specific}} laboratory or imaging {{test can}} be performed to diagnose <b>irritable</b> bowel syndrome. Diagnosis involves excluding conditions that produce IBS-like symptoms, and then following a procedure to categorize the patient's symptoms. Ruling out parasitic infections, lactose intolerance, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and celiac disease is recommended for all patients before a diagnosis of <b>irritable</b> bowel syndrome is made. In patients over 50 years old, they are recommended to undergo a screening colonoscopy. IBS sufferers {{are at increased risk}} of being given inappropriate surgeries such as appendectomy, cholecystectomy, and hysterectomy due to their IBS symptoms being misdiagnosed as other medical conditions.|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{diarrhea}} can be {{the part}} of the presentations of a number of chronic medical conditions affecting the intestine. Common causes include ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, microscopic colitis, celiac disease, <b>irritable</b> bowel syndrome and bile acid malabsorption.|$|E
