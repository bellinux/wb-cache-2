The following compounds considered for regulation so far: aldrin, chlordane, chlorodecone, DDT, dieldrin, dioxins, furans, endrin, heptachlor, <b>hexabromobiphenyl,</b> hexachlorobenzene, HCHs, mirex, PAHs, PCBs and toxaphene...|$|E
40|$|In November, 1976 the Environmental Sciences Laboratory of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, {{examined}} 1029 {{persons in}} Michigan {{for the potential}} health effects of exposure to PBB. Included in this group were 55 persons from Michigan Chemical Corporation and 237 farming families. Blood serum was analyzed for PBB. FireMaster FF- 1 contains several bromobiphenyl components, the major constituent being approximately 60 % 2, 4, 4, 2 ' 4 ' 4 '-hexabromobiphenyl. Other PBB homologs identifiable as peaks by gas chromatography [...] mass spectrometry include two pentabromobiphenyl peaks, three additional <b>hexabromobiphenyl</b> peaks, and two heptabromobiphenyl peaks. The relative concentrations, {{with respect to the}} major <b>hexabromobiphenyl</b> peak, of these minor constituents (1 [...] 20 %) of PBB were different for persons from Michigan Chemical Corporation and for farmers. Penta-, hexa-, and hepta-bromobiphenyl components in serum samples analyzed from farming families from Michigan Chemical Corporation employees were compared with relative concentrations of these homologs in FireMaster mixture and in tissue and blood samples from rats fed FireMaster FF- 1. Varying concentrations of these PBB components are attributed to different routes of exposure and the relative ease of metabolism and excretion of one pentabromobiphenyl component...|$|E
40|$|The OECD Screening Tool {{for overall}} {{persistence}} (Pov) and long-range transport potential (LRTP) {{is applied to}} four POP candidates, �-HCH, pentabromodiphenyl ether (BDE- 99), <b>hexabromobiphenyl</b> (HBB), and chlordecone. Chemical properties required as input parameters for the Tool are compiled and Pov and two LRTP metrics, characteristic travel distance and transfer efficiency, are calculated for the four chemicals. Comparison of the Pov and LRTP estimates of the four POP candidates with results for several identified POPs shows that the four POP candidates have Pov and LRTP properties {{similar to those of}} several known POPs (PCBs, organochlorine pesticides). An uncertainty analysis indicates that this result is valid although there are considerable uncertainties in the chemical properties of the four POP candidates...|$|E
40|$|Six polybrominated {{diphenyl}} ethers (PBDEs), one <b>hexabromobiphenyl</b> [polybrominated biphenyl (PBB) ], and one hexachlorobiphenyl [polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) ] {{were measured}} in 40 human serum pools {{collected in the}} southeastern United States during 1985 through 2002 and in Seattle, Washington, for 1999 through 2002. The concentrations {{of most of the}} PBDEs, which are commercially used as flame retardants in common household and commercial applications, had significant positive correlations with time of sample collection, showing that the concentrations of these compounds are increasing in serum collected in the United States. In contrast, PCB and PBB levels were negatively correlated with sample collection year, indicating that the levels of these compounds have been decreasing since their phaseout in the 1970 s.

40|$|Groups of Swiss ICR mice {{were fed}} 1000 ppm polybrominated biphenyls (FireMaster BP- 6) in rodent chow for 4, 8, 11, and 14 days. Control groups were fed {{standard}} rodent chow without FireMaster BP- 6. Animals were {{killed at the}} end of each feeding period and the livers examined by electron microscopy. EM changes noted were progressive increase in size of hepatocytes, a decrease in rough endoplasmic reticulum, a marked increase in smooth endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondrial degeneration, increased lysosomes, and a decrease in glycogen. In addition, there was increasing proliferation of microvilli in bile canaliculi with increasing feeding times. A group of mice fed 1000 ppm FireMaster BP- 6 in rodent chow for 11 days had livers with a mean of 13. 93 % of total body weight as compared with 6. 49 % for the control group (P= 0. 02). Tissue distribution following ingestion of 100 ppm FireMaster BP- 6 for 14 days was studied.

40|$|In {{a series}} of polybrominated {{biphenyl}} (PBB) feeding trials in White Leghorn cockerel chicks, the effects of PBB on various physiological parameters and organ weights were determined. These measurements included: growth, thyroid function, ECG, cardiac output, blood pressure, hematocrit, erythropoietin levels, and spleen, bursa of Fabricius, thyroid, testes, comb, liver weights. In addition, tissues were histologically examined. PBB, in the commercial grade form of <b>hexabromobiphenyl,</b> was administered continuously in the diet at levels ranging from 50 to 250 ppm. Pair-feeding studies were conducted to ascertain {{the effects of the}} drug per se since preliminary trials indicated that PBB administration resulted in decreased feed intake. Chronic administration resulted in depressed body weight as a result of decreased feed intake; decreased comb, testes, spleen, and bursa weights; increased liver and thyroid weight; hydropericardium and ascites; decreased hematological values due to depressed plasma erythropietin levels; decreased heart rate, packed cell volume, hemoglobin and cardiac output; decreased voltage amplitude of the ECG and a shift in the mean electrical axis. No significant differences were found in blood pressure (mean arterial and pulse pressure), stroke volume, or respiratory rate...|$|E
30|$|Several {{chemicals}} {{are listed as}} POP by the Stockholm Convention. These compounds usually share {{a high degree of}} halogenation. Among them are some organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and –furans (PCDD/F), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), <b>hexabromobiphenyl</b> (HBB), hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) or perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS). Some POP are unintentionally formed, e.g. PCDD/F by combustion of chlorine-containing substrate or as by-products of industrial processes. Others were intentionally produced for applications as pesticides or industrial chemicals, e.g., PCB as heat exchange fluid or additive in paints and plastics, PFOS as coating additive, or HBCD, HBB, and PBDE as flame retardants [49]. Production or applications of POP are regulated or restricted; however, market demands often require adequate replacements. For example, bis(2 -ethylhexyl)-tetrabromophthalate (BEHTeBP) and 2 -Ethylhexyl- 2, 3, 4, 5 -tetrabromobenzoate (EHTeBB) were used to replace PentaBDE. Decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) or Dechlorane Plus (DP) were introduced as alternative for DecaBDE [47, 58]. Although such substitutes might not meet all POP criteria, they often share properties as those substances they were designed to replace and thus might be similarly harmful to the environment or to humans. Therefore, it is not only important to monitor classical POP but also to investigate their substitutes or compounds with (anticipated) POP-like properties.|$|E
40|$|Soil {{samples were}} {{collected}} from 28 fields which had received manure from Michigan's most highly contaminated dairy herds. The number of fields in each concentration range of PBB in soil were: 2, not detectable; 15, 0. 0 to 8. 0 ppb; 6, 14 - 102 ppb, and 5, 153 to 371 ppb. Plant tissue sampled from the 10 most highly contaminated fields contained no detectable PBB. No evidence of significant degradation of PBB was noted after 1 year incubation in soil. When 'IC <b>hexabromobiphenyl</b> and heptabromobiphenyl isomers were incubated in soil < 0. 2 % of the 14 C was volatilized. Also gas chromatographic analysis of soil extracts showed no difference in recovery of the six major PBB isomers between sterilized and nonsterilized soil. Analysis of these extracts by thin layer chromatography and autoradiography showed no 14 C-PBB intermediates. Photodegradation products of the major hexa- and heptabromobiphenyl isomers showed more but still minor (. - 3 %) biodegradation in soil. Much of the photodegradation products appeared bound to soil, since these products could not be extracted from soil. Photodegradation {{does not appear to}} be a significant fate of PBB in manures spread on fields since no change was noted in the relative concentrations of isomers in soil samples from our field survey. Studies with distilled, tap, river, and soil waters showed that PBB solubility was markedly influenced by water composition...|$|E
40|$|Polybrominated {{biphenyl}} (PBB), a fire retardant, was accidentally {{substituted for}} an animal feed supplement in Michigan 10 years ago. This led to widespread livestock contamination {{and ultimately to}} contamination of virtually every human residing in the State at that time. In order to evaluate the extent of PBB persistence and distribution in human tissues 10 years after this accidental poisoning, a study was conducted {{on a series of}} autopsy cases from the Grand Rapids ("high" exposure) area of the State. No attempt was made to relate cause of death to PBB exposure or tissue concentration. Samples of 196 tissues from 15 subjects were analyzed for PBB content, and levels were determined by measurement of the <b>hexabromobiphenyl</b> peak using electron capture gas chromatography. Only 4 of the 196 samples analyzed did not have PBB concentration above the limit of detection (0. 5 ng/g). As expected, fat and fat-rich tissue had the highest PBB concentration. Perirenal fat had the highest mean concentration (475 ng/g). Adrenal, atheromatus aorta and thymus had mean concentrations about half that of perirenal fat; all other tissues had mean concentrations one-tenth or less of perirenal fat. The results document that PBB is still present in human tissue and that PBB was distributed in all tissues examined. The PBB fat elimination half-time was estimated to be at least 7. 8 years. If this is approximately correct, PBB will persist in tissues throughout the lifetime of humans so contaminated...|$|E
40|$|A field {{biochemical}} epidemiology {{study was}} conducted using the Michigan cohort consisting of 51 rural residents exposed to polybrominated biphenyls (PBB). The study had three major objectives: a) to determine the serum half-life of the major PBB congener, <b>hexabromobiphenyl</b> (HBB), in the human, b) {{to determine if the}} PBB-exposed subjects had elevated cytochrome P- 450 I function as determined by the caffeine breath test (CBT) and the caffeine urinary metabolite ratio (CMR), and c) to determine the applicability of the CBT and CMR in field studies. PBB serum levels were detected in 36 of the 51 PBB-exposed subjects. The serum half-life of HBB was determined by comparing the current serum HBB values to the subject's previous serum values obtained 5 to 8 years earlier. The median HBB half-life was 12 years (range 4 - 97 years). The CBT and CMR were elevated in the subjects exposed to PBBs as compared to the values obtained from urban nonsmokers and were similar to those found in adults who smoke. A gender effect was seen in the PBB-exposed subjects, the median CBT and CMR values of the females being lower than the values of males. There was a correlation between the CBT and the HBB serum values (r 2 = 0. 2, p = 0. 01) but not between CMR and HBB serum values. The CBT and CMR were easily conducted in the field and appear to be useful metabolic probes of cytochrome P- 450 I activity in human environmental toxicology...|$|E
40|$|A {{commercial}} {{polybrominated biphenyl}} mixture was separated chromatographically into two fractions on neutral alumina (AA and AB) and into three fractions on Florisil (FA, FB, and FC) by sequential elution with solvents of increasing polarity. Using established methods, {{the activity of}} each fraction as hepatic microsomal cytochrome P- 450 - and/or cytochrome P- 448 -dependent monooxygenase enzyme inducers was examined in the male Wister rat. Like the coadministration of phenobarbitone and 3 -methylcholanthrene, commercial PBBs, either unfractionated or reconstituted from its various fractions, induced both cytochromes P- 450 and P- 448. Both cytochromes were also induced by the less-polar fractions AA and FA. In contrast, little or no inductive effects were exhibited by the more polar Florisil fractions, FB and FC, indicating that the ability of commercial PBBs to induce cytochrome P- 448 is not due to contaminating brominated dibenzofurans or dibenzodioxins. Unlike the polar Florisil fraction, the more polar alumina fraction, AB, was a potent microsomal enzyme inducer. This fraction was enriched in 2, 3, 3 ', 4, 4 ', 5 -hexa- and 2, 2 ', 3, 3 ', 4, 4 ', 5 -heptabromobiphenyl and also contained unassigned monochloro derivatives of a penta- and <b>hexabromobiphenyl,</b> namely C 12 H 4 Br 5 Cl and C 12 H 3 Br 6 Cl, respectively. The data strongly suggest that the biologic effects of the commercial polybrominated biphenyl mixture are due to the various halogenated biphenyls present. These results are {{discussed in terms of}} the reported toxic potency of each PBB fraction and with reference to the known biologic activity of individual polybrominated biphenyl congeners or their chloro analogs...|$|E
40|$|Polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) and polybrominated {{diphenyl}} ethers (PBDEs) {{may pose}} a worldwide pollution problem {{because of their}} persistence, long-range transport capability, and predisposition to bioaccumulate. The ubiquitous presence of PBBs and PBDEs has heightened interest in determination of their fate. We report results for a fugacity-based dynamic environmental and bioaccumulation model of the fate of <b>hexabromobiphenyl</b> (hexaBB) discharged into the Saginaw Bay region of Lake Huron, USA. We calculated transient fugacity profiles of hexaBB in Lake Huron and Lake Erie water and sediment during the 1970 s, 1980 s, and 1990 s. The hexaBB concentrations in the environmental compartments were used as inputs for a dynamic bioaccumulation model of Lake Huron and Lake Erie aquatic biota. The model {{results indicate that the}} sediment compartments of Lakes Huron and Erie serve as reservoirs for the accumulation and slow transfer of hexaBB to the food web constituents of these lakes. We present bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) and compare the predicted hexaBB concentrations in lake trout from the bioaccumulation model with measurements during the period 1980 to 2000. An uncertainty analysis for this model suggests that errors associated with input parameter uncertainty can be reduced by refining estimates of the sediment degradation half-life of hexaBB. The corroborated PBB model has carryover application for modeling the fate of polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) contaminants in the Great Lakes. By fitting model outputs to field measurement data using the transformed least square fit method, we report estimations of 2, 2 ′, 4, 4 ′-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE- 47) emission rates into the Lake Huron and Lake Erie watershed areas.

40|$|The {{metabolism}} of polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) was {{studied in}} vitro by using rat liver microsomes {{in the presence}} of NADPH and atmospheric 02. Quantitative recoveries of all PBBs were obtained after incubations with control or 3 -methylcholanthrene (MC) induced microsomes. Of the twelve major components, losses of only peaks I (2, 4, 5, 2 ', 5 '-pentabromobiphenyl) and 3 (a <b>hexabromobiphenyl)</b> were observed following incubations with microsomes from phenobarbital (PB) - or PBBs- pretreated rats. Of seven structurally identified PBB components, only peak 1 has a bromine-free para position. Peaks 1, 2, and 5 all have two adjacent unsubstituted carbons, yet only peak I is metabolized. Of two dibromobiphenyl model compounds studied, the 2, 2 '-congener was very rapidly metabolized by PB-induced microsomes whereas its 4, 4 '-isomer was not. These results suggest that the presence of a free para position is required for the metabolism of brominated biphenyls. Of lesser importance appears to be the number of bromines or the availability of two adjacent unsubstituted carbons. In vivo evidence for the metabolism of peaks 1 and 3 was also provided by their drastically diminished levels in liver and milk extracts. When a ' 4 C-PBB mixture consisting almost exclusively of peaks 4 (2, 4, 5, 2 ', 4 ', 5 '-hexabromobiphenyl) and 8 (2, 3, 4, 5, 2 ' 4 ', 5 '-heptabromobiphenyl) was incubated with PB- or PBBs- induced microsomes and NADPH, only traces of radioactivity remained with the microsomes after extensive extraction. However, less radioactivity was bound to microsomes from MC pretreated or especially control rats. No radioactivity was bound to exogenous DNA included in similar microsomal incubations, regardless of the type of microsomes used. Under the same conditions, [3 H]-benzo[a]pyrene metabolites were bound to DNA, and PBB-induced microsomes enhanced this binding more than six-fold. The economic and health effects due to this incident have been reviewed by Dunkel (2), Mercer et al. (3), and Kay (4). More recently traces of PBBs were detected in soil, plants, water, fish, and human hair in both New York and New Jersey (5) ...|$|E
