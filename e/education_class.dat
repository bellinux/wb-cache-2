Gabe takes Andy to his cubicle and admonishes him for his behavior, revealing he is aware why Andy hosted the sex ed class. He explains to Andy that the only reason he asked Erin out was because Andy gave his blessing, which Andy reveals was just a result of his difficulty saying no to how politely Gabe asked him.

The two secondary purposes of the study were to compare: 1. the results of ITED scores of Bartlett students enrolled in vocational <b>education</b> <b>classes</b> at the Career Center, Bartlett students enrolled in non-vocational <b>education</b> <b>classes,</b> and students enrolled in vocational <b>education</b> <b>classes</b> at Bartlett High School, and 2. the results of ITED scores of Bartlett Caucasian vocational education students with Bartlett non-Caucasian vocational education students. Procedure The samples were randomly selected from students receiving final grades during the Spring semester of 1979 at Bartlett High School, Anchorage, Alaska. A fixed one-way analysis of variance design was used to determine if there were significant differences between groups. Where a significant difference was indicated, the Least Significant Difference (L. S. D.) test was utilized to determine the location of these differences. Conclusions Based upon the results of this study, the following conclusions were drawn: 1. Mastery of the basic skills for vocational <b>education</b> <b>classes</b> is as important as in the academic areas. 2. The stigma of vocational <b>education</b> <b>classes</b> as a "dumping ground" for the academic classes was shown to be a misconception. 3.

He has been convicted of several sexual crimes involving minors, including a conviction for possession of child pornography in the UK in 1997, and his conviction for child sexual abuse in Vietnam in 2005. Charities dedicated to serving and helping children have filed complaints to Fox and the producers of Glee. Television executives in the UK, where the episode was to be broadcast about a month later than in the US, were rumored to be considering {{the removal of the}} scene entirely. However, a spokesperson for Channel 4 stated that the episode would air in full, and explained: [...] "The scene is editorially justified within the programme and we do not seek to censor material in the proper context." [...] Claude Knights, {{the executive director of the}} London-based children's charity Kidscape, said, [...] "It is regrettable that the producers did not consider the implication of using such a track in the context of a sex <b>education</b> <b>class.</b> The fact that this song is linked to Gary Glitter ... make it wholly inappropriate".

[...] When Lois catches Chris and his friends watching a pornographic film, she tells them that without sex education, they can easily become sexually confused. [...] The scene cuts to Michael Jackson in his childhood form eating a bowl of Frosted Mini-Wheats, saying that he likes the frosted side, while the grown-up in him likes his younger self. [...] When Lois teaches a sex <b>education</b> <b>class,</b> Peter uses a bust of William Shakespeare and a Rainbow Brite doll to demonstrate sexual intercourse.

While she usually takes her family's problems with good humor, in [...] "Homer Alone" [...] (season three, 1992), her workload and resultant stress caused her to have a mental breakdown.

Marge often provides a grounding opinion for Homer and their marriage has often been shaky. Marge admits that she [...] "put {{up with a lot}} in [...] marriage," [...] and has left Homer or thrown {{him out of the house}} on several occasions. One of the first such episodes to depict this is [...] "Secrets of a Successful Marriage" [...] (season five, 1994), where Homer starts teaching an adult <b>education</b> <b>class</b> on how to build a successful marriage. He is at first unsuccessful, but gains the interest of the class when he starts giving away family secrets, many of which concern Marge. Upon finding this out, Marge is incensed and throws him out of the house. The next day, Homer is dirty and disheveled, and begs Marge to take him back, saying the one thing he can offer her that nobody else can is [...] "complete and utter dependence." [...] At first, Marge does not see that as a benefit, but eventually admits that he [...] "really [...] make a gal feel needed." [...] Episodes that depict marital problems have become more frequent in recent seasons of the show. Through it all, Marge has remained faithful to Homer, despite temptations to the contrary such as the one in [...] "Life on the Fast Lane" [...] (season one, 1990), where she resists the charming Frenchman Jacques and instead chooses to remain with Homer.|$|E
40|$|Purpose. The aim of our {{investigation}} was to establish {{the efficiency of the}} integrated physical <b>education</b> <b>classes</b> for schoolchildren with minor deviations in health. Methods. Sociological (questionnaire), biomedical, pedagogical (testing), psycho-diagnostic, and mathematical statistics. Pupils (N = 1417) of secondary school (both sexes, 5 th− 9 th forms, i. e. aged 10 − 15) were examined. Results. The characteristics of physical and mental development in the process of integrated physical education proved to be significantly better for different sex and age groups. Analysis of physical fitness characteristics shows that integrated physical <b>education</b> <b>classes</b> {{turned out to be more}} effective for schoolchildren with minor health deviations than for apparently healthy students. Integrated physical <b>education</b> <b>classes</b> are more effective for students’ dexterity than for their power endurance. Integrated physical <b>education</b> <b>classes</b> are more effective for female students than for male ones; for schoolchildren with minor health deviations in older age groups (7 th− 9 th forms) than for younger schoolchildren. Those schoolchildren who attended integrated physical <b>education</b> <b>classes</b> expressed significantly better attitudes to physical education than their peers who studied in a segregated environment. Conclusions. Integrated physical <b>education</b> <b>classes</b> are a more progressive and effective form of physical education in terms of their beneficial effect upon the physical and mental development of secondary school children with minor health distortions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{analyze the}} {{association}} between physical activity, participation in Physical <b>Education</b> <b>classes,</b> and indicators of social isolation among adolescents. MethodsThis was an epidemiological study based on secondary analysis of data from {{a representative sample of}} students (14 – 19 years) from public high schools (n= 4, 207). Data were collected through the questionnaire Global School-based Student Health Survey. The independent variables were the level of physical activity and enrollment in Physical <b>Education</b> <b>classes,</b> while the dependent variables were two indicators of social isolation (feeling of loneliness and having few friends). Descriptive and inferential procedures were used in the statistical analysis. ResultsMost of the adolescents were classified as insufficiently active (65. 1 %) and reported not attending Physical <b>Education</b> <b>classes</b> (64. 9 %). Approximately two in each ten participants reported feeling of loneliness (15. 8 %) and, in addition, about one in each five adolescents reported have only one friend (19. 5 %). In the bivariate analysis, a significantly lower proportion of individuals reporting social isolation was observed among adolescents who referred higher enrollment in Physical <b>Education</b> <b>classes.</b> After adjustment for confounding variables, binary logistic regression showed that attending Physical <b>Education</b> <b>classes</b> was identified as a protective factor in relation to the indicator of social isolation ‘having few friends,’ but only for girls. ConclusionsIt was concluded that participation in Physical <b>Education</b> <b>classes</b> is associated with reduced social isolation among female adolescents...|$|R
