It was almost certainly written within {{three or four years}} of Columba's death and is the earliest vernacular poem in European history. It consists of 25 stanzas of four verses of seven syllables each.|$|R

He taught in the course from 1988 to 2010 and believes the students are people who have existing or potential writing talent. Stephen Grimwade, current Melbourne Writers Festival Director and ex-student of Antoni's sums up many students' feelings when he explains that Antoni changed his life.

In this book Tony Blackshaw doesn't <b>just</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> that Bauman is a massive star in sociology, he demonstrates why his light shines brighter than that of almost any other intellectual figure {{in the world today}} by offering his readers deep insights into the 'Bauman Effect'. The new Bauman reader is two books in one. On the one hand, it is a critical introduction to a vital and inspiring sociologist who stands against the predictable in 'majority' sociology to draw out daring and new insights from which we can all learn. On the other, it is an anthology of his work chosen with the specific aim of guiding readers, whether undergraduates, postgraduates, academics or general readers to Bauman's original way of 'thinking sociologically', which is as irresistible as the 'liquid' metaphor that guides it...|$|E
40|$|A {{considerable}} {{variety of}} methods {{have been used to}} understand the complex, multifaceted nature of L 2 writing. Often driven by pedagogical imperatives and informed by particular views of writing, texts and writers, these methods themselves raise questions regarding what we believe writing is and about our interpretive practices. With increasing numbers of teachers and scholars turning to investigate writing in their classrooms or courses of further study, it may be helpful to be aware of what options are available for studying writing and how these relate to key methodological designs. More than this, however, {{it is important to be}} aware of what our choices imply about our understanding of what writing is and how it can be known. In this paper I set out the main approaches to studying writing for novice researchers, providing examples of key studies, and go on to situate these methods within the main theories about writing arguing that methods are not neutral options but allow us to see certain things but not others. They do not <b>just</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> different things about writing but reveal what we believe writing to be...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} two {{different}} nonlinear interpolating paths in adiabatic evolution algorithms for solving a particular class of quantum search problems where both the initial and final Hamiltonian are one-dimensional projector Hamiltonians on the corresponding ground state. If the overlap between the initial state and final {{state of the}} quantum system is not equal to zero, both of these models can provide a constant time speedup over the usual adiabatic algorithms by increasing some another corresponding "complexity". But when the initial state has a zero overlap with the solution state in the problem, the second model leads to an infinite time complexity of the algorithm for whatever interpolating functions being applied while the first one can still provide a constant running time. However, inspired by a related reference, {{a variant of the}} first model can be constructed which also fails for the problem when the overlap is exactly equal to zero if we want to make up the "intrinsic" fault of the second model-an increase in energy. Two concrete theorems are given to serve as explanations why neither of these two models can improve the usual adiabatic evolution algorithms for the phenomenon above. These <b>just</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> what should be noted when using certain nonlinear evolution paths in adiabatic quantum algorithms for some special kind of problems. Comment: 11 page...|$|E
