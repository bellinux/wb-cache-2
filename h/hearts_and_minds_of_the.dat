Your children and grandchildren when they visit Israel will find your monument". [...] Second, Warren recalled that Kennedy had visited Israel twice, the first time in 1939 when it was still part of the British Mandate, and the second time in 1951. Speaking in 1951 {{of the differences between the}} people he witnessed during those two visits, he said that [...] "Perhaps the greatest change of all I found in the <b>hearts</b> <b>and</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people, For unlike the discouraged settlers of 1939 they looked to the future with hope.

500|$|The writers {{originally}} wanted American actor Sheldon Leonard {{to voice}} Fat Tony, {{but they were}} unable to get him, so they went with Joe Mantegna instead. Mantegna was offered the role during the show's second season, and since he had seen the show before and thought it was [...] "funny", he decided to give it a shot. He felt honored that they asked him to do a voice for the show. In an interview with The A.V. Club, Mantegna said he thinks the reason he got the role was partly due to his performance in the 1990 Mafia film The Godfather Part III, which opened just prior to when he received the role. He thought the script was smart and clever and that he enjoyed recording it. Mantegna has since appeared many times on the show as Fat Tony, who became a recurring character; it is Mantegna's longest-running role in his acting career. Mantegna commented: [...] "Who knew that Fat Tony was gonna resonate in the <b>hearts</b> <b>and</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> [...] out there? Apparently [...] got enough feedback as to how the character was liked that they wrote it in again and again, and I was kind of a recurring guy that they’d tap into at least a couple episodes a season." ...|$|E
