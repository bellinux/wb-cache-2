40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{refrigeration}} performance of three CO 2  trans-critical solutions based on field measurements. The measurements {{are carried out}} in five supermarkets in Sweden. Using the field measurements, low and medium temperature level cooling capacities and COP's are calculated for ten-minute intervals, filtered and averaged to monthly values. The {{results indicate that the}} systems using trans-critical booster system with gas removal from the intermediate vessel have relatively the highest total COP. The reasons are higher evaporation temperatures, lower internal and external superheat and higher total efficiency of booster compressors. Another important factor is gas removal from the intermediate vessel which leads to higher COP of low temperature level. Comparing the older and newer installed systems, a trend in energy efficiency improvement has been seen. The study shows this improvement originates from both changes in the system design (e. g. two stage expansion) and components efficiency improvement (e. g. higher total efficiency of compressors - lower <b>internal</b> <b>superheat</b> and higher evaporation temperatures of cabinets).

30|$|To {{maintain}} high <b>internal</b> pressure during <b>superheated</b> reactions, {{the reaction}} vessel is sealed by firmly pressing upward against the gasket {{on the bottom}} of the cassette. Each cassette has two independent reaction positions to support up to two separate sealed reactions in each reaction vessel (Figure  5). To characterize the seal integrity, approximately 1 mL of anhydrous acetonitrile was sealed and heated at 165 °C for 1 h. In all experiments, < 14 μL of volume was lost (< 1.5 %). We believe the actual loss of vapor to be even lower because often some small drops of condensed solvent were observed on the gasket where the reaction vessel had been sealed.|$|R
40|$|Together {{with the}} {{high-temperature}} polymer electrolyte fuel cell, the reactor for the autothermal reforming (ATR) of liquid hydrocarbons, such as diesel fuel or kerosene, {{is the key}} component of the Jülich fuel cell system in the 5 kWe power class. This paper presents some of Jülich’s most recent development {{in the field of}} ATR reactors, specifically the ATR 12. ATR 12 is characterized by a new concept for the <b>internal</b> generation of <b>superheated</b> steam as one of the ATR reactants using concentric shells instead of coiled tubing and particularly by the integration of an electric heating wire to enable fast and autonomous start-up. Three different experimental procedures for heating up the ATR 12 are presented and discussed, the most suitable of which enables the start-up of the ATR 12 within approximately 15 min. As a consequence, from the system perspective, the bulky start-up burner, which is also difficult to control, along with the corresponding heat exchanger unit, can be dispensed with. Additionally, comprehensive steady-state experiments identify suitable reaction conditions for the operation of the ATR 12...|$|R
