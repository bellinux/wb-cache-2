50|$|Gamma {{spectroscopy}} yields {{results that}} are conceptually equivalent to alpha-particle spectroscopy, however, can result in sharper peaks due to reduced attenuation of energy.

The most common gamma-ray detector is a semiconductor <b>germanium</b> <b>detector</b> which allow for a greater energy resolution than alpha-particle spectroscopy, however gamma spectroscopy only has an efficiency of a few percent.

40|$|The third High Energy Astronomy Observatory (HEAO 3), {{successfully}} {{launched into}} {{low earth orbit}} on September 20, 1979, carries a large high-resolution gamma-ray spectrometer designed for cosmic nuclear spectroscopy. This gamma-ray spectrometer (the HEAO C- 1 experiment) consists of a cluster of four coaxial high-purity <b>germanium</b> <b>detectors,</b> each with a volume of approximately 100 cu cm. Surrounding the <b>germanium</b> <b>detectors</b> is a 6. 6 -cm thick CsI shield operating in active anticoincidence with the central detectors and defining a field of view of about 30 deg FWHM.

All valid events in the <b>germanium</b> <b>detectors</b> are individually analyzed by an 8192 -channel pulse area analyzer and transmitted at a maximum rate of 15. 6 evens/s for each detector.

50|$|The {{most common}} figure {{used to express}} {{detector}} resolution is full width at half maximum (FWHM). This is {{the width of the}} gamma ray peak at half of the highest point on the peak distribution. Resolution figures are given with reference to specified gamma ray energies. Resolution can be expressed in absolute (i.e., eV or MeV) or relative terms. For example, a sodium iodide (NaI) detector may have a FWHM of 9.15 keV at 122 keV, and 82.75 keV at 662 keV. These resolution values are expressed in absolute terms. To express the resolution in relative terms, the FWHM in eV or MeV is divided by the energy of the gamma ray and usually shown as percentage. Using the preceding example, the resolution of the detector is 7.5% at 122 keV, and 12.5% at 662 keV. A <b>germanium</b> <b>detector</b> may give resolution of 560 eV at 122 keV, yielding a relative resolution of 0.46%.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a change}} in {{philosophy}} when measuring with a TAS. Instead of detecting the individual gamma rays (as high-resolution detectors do), it will detect the gamma cascades emitted in the decay. Then, the final energy spectrum will not be a collection of different energy peaks coming from the different transitions (as can be expected {{in the case of a}} <b>germanium</b> <b>detector),</b> but a collection of peaks situated at an energy that is the sum of the different energies of all the gammas of the cascade emitted from each level. This means that the energy spectrum measured with a TAS will be in reality a spectrum of the levels of the nuclei, where each peak is a level populated in the decay. Since the efficiency of these detectors is close to 100%, it is possible to see the feeding to the high excitation levels that usually can not be seen by high-resolution detectors. This makes total absorption spectroscopy the best method to measure beta feedings and provide accurate beta intensity (Iβ) distributions for complex decay schemes.|$|E
