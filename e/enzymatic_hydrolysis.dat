40|$|The {{effect of}} {{hemicellulose}} and lignin solubilisation by H 2 SO 4 and NaOH catalysed pretreatments was correlated {{to the extent}} of subsequent <b>enzymatic</b> cellulose <b>hydrolysis.</b> Three different grass-type feedstocks, palm empty fruit bunch, sugarcane bagasse and barley straw, were investigated. Soluble fractions after catalysis were characterised for mono- and oligosaccharides contents, while the residues were analysed for constituent monosaccharides composition. Alkali pretreatment resulted into extensive lignin removal. This removal resulted in up to 90 % (w/w) conversion of glucan into glucose by enzymes. But, the alkaline conditions also provoked up to 50 % unwanted xylan losses. Acid pretreatment resulted into solubilisation (70 – 80 % (w/w)) of xylan with almost no losses, while lignin remained. Although moderate xylan solubilisation increased <b>enzymatic</b> cellulose <b>hydrolysis</b> of residual glucan, extensive removal of xylan decreased it. Therefore, under the treatment conditions, the alkali treatments were the most efficient in terms of enzymatic release of xylose and glucose from the insoluble residues...|$|R

25|$|Parecoxib sodium is a {{water-soluble}} inactive ester amide prodrug of valdecoxib, a novel second-generation COX-2-specific inhibitor and {{the first}} such agent to be developed for injectable use. It is rapidly converted by hepatic <b>enzymatic</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> to the active form valdecoxib. The compound then undergoes another conversion, which involves both cytochrome P450-mediated pathway (CYP2C9, CYP3A4) and non-cytochrome P450-mediated pathway, to hydroxylated metabolite and glucuronide metabolite. The hydroxylated metabolite, that also has weak COX-2-specific inhibitory properties, is then further metabolized by non-cytochrome P450 pathway to a glucuronide metabolite. These metabolites are excreted in the urine.|$|E
25|$|Collagen {{hydrolysis}} {{is performed}} {{by one of}} three different methods: acid-, alkali-, and <b>enzymatic</b> <b>hydrolysis.</b> Acid treatment is especially suitable for less fully crosslinked materials such as pig skin collagen and normally requires 10 to 48 hours. Alkali treatment is suitable for more complex collagen such as that found in bovine hides and requires more time, normally several weeks. The purpose of the alkali treatment is to destroy certain chemical crosslinks still present in collagen. Within the gelatin industry, the gelatin obtained from acid-treated raw material has been called type-A gelatin and the gelatin obtained from alkali-treated raw material {{is referred to as}} type-B gelatin.|$|E

30|$|The widely {{accepted}} mechanism for <b>enzymatic</b> cellulose <b>hydrolysis</b> involves synergistic actions by endo-glucanase or CMCase (EC 3.2. 1.4), exoglucanase or cellobiohyrolase (EC 3.1. 1.91) and β-glucosidase (EC 3.2. 1.21) (Lynd et al. 2002; Zhang and Lynd 2004; Sadhu et al. 2013). Endoglucanase hydrolyzes accessible intra-molecular β- 1 - 4 glucosidic bonds of cellulose chain ends. Exoglucanases processively cleave cellulose soluble cellobiose or glucose and β-glucosidase hydrolyzes cellobiose to glucose (Krishna 1999; Zhang et al. 2006).|$|R
25|$|The <b>enzymatic</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> of ATP {{requires}} proper binding of the phosphates and {{positioning of}} the γ-phosphate to the attacking water. In the nucleotide binding site, the oxygen atoms of the β- and γ-phosphates of ATP are stabilized by residues in the Walker A motif and coordinate with Mg2+. This Mg2+ ion also coordinates with the terminal aspartate residue in the Walker B motif through the attacking H2O. A general base, {{which may be the}} glutamate residue adjacent to the Walker B motif, glutamine in the Q-loop, or a histidine in the switch region that forms a hydrogen bond with the γ-phosphate of ATP, is found to catalyze the rate of ATP hydrolysis by promoting the attacking H2O. The precise molecular mechanism of ATP hydrolysis is still controversial.|$|E

2500|$|DNA {{polymerase}} adds a new {{strand of}} DNA by extending the 3' {{end of an}} existing nucleotide chain, adding new nucleotides matched to the template strand {{one at a time}} via the creation of phosphodiester bonds. The energy for this process of DNA polymerization comes from hydrolysis of the high-energy phosphate (phosphoanhydride) bonds between the three phosphates attached to each unincorporated base. [...] Free bases with their attached phosphate groups are called nucleotides; in particular, bases with three attached phosphate groups are called nucleoside triphosphates. When a nucleotide is being added to a growing DNA strand, the formation of a phosphodiester bond between the proximal phosphate of the nucleotide to the growing chain is accompanied by hydrolysis of a high-energy phosphate bond with release of the two distal phosphates as a pyrophosphate. <b>Enzymatic</b> <b>hydrolysis</b> of the resulting pyrophosphate into inorganic phosphate consumes a second high-energy phosphate bond and renders the reaction effectively irreversible.|$|E

40|$|To the Editor: We {{read with}} {{interest}} the recent article and correspondence regarding the interpretation of ecgonine methyl ester (EME) concentrations in postmortem blood (1, 2). It appears to {{us that there is}} much to support he notion that the majority of EME found in the blood of cocaine users is generated either during the postmortem interval or after collection of the sample. The practice of summing the molar EME and cocaine concentrations a proposed by Isenschmid et al. would therefore appear to have some value. However, considerations regarding the fate of EME itself lead us to suggest that the following caveat be added: The molar sum of the cocaine and EME concentrations found at the time of analysis hould be considered representative of the minimum as opposed to the actual perimortem cocaine concentration. It is generally recognized that human plasma eholinesterase (EC 3. 1. 1. 8) will convert cocaine to EME (3, 4). There are several isoforms of this enzyme with varying degrees of activity. Benzoyl ester hydrolysis is a well-known reaction of the enzyme, and benzoylcholine is a common substrate in assays for cholinesterase activity. Significantly, Stewart et al.

The amount of Ca(OH) 2 dissolving in fresh urine depends significantly on {{the composition of the}} urine. The different urine compositions used in our simulations showed that between 4. 3 and 5. 8  g Ca(OH) 2 dissolved in 1  L of urine at 25  °C. At this temperature, the pH at saturation is 12. 5 and is far above the pH of 11, which we identified as the upper limit for <b>enzymatic</b> urea <b>hydrolysis.</b> However, temperature has a strong effect on the saturation pH, with higher values being achieved at lower temperatures. Based on our results, we recommend a dosage of 10  g Ca(OH) 2  L− 1 of fresh urine to ensure solid Ca(OH) 2 always remains in the urine reactor which ensures sufficiently high pH values. Besides providing sufficient Ca(OH) 2, the temperature has to be kept in a certain range to prevent chemical urea hydrolysis. At temperatures below 14  °C, the saturation pH is higher than 13, which favors chemical urea hydrolysis. We chose a precautionary upper temperature of 40  °C because the rate of chemical urea hydrolysis increases at higher temperatures but this should be confirmed with kinetic studies. By considering the boundaries for pH and temperature developed in this study, urine can be stabilized effectively with Ca(OH) 2 thereby simplifying later treatment processes or making direct use easier...|$|R
