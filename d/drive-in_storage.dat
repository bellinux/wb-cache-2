40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the influence}} of horizontal bracing restraints provided by the friction between pallet bases and rail beams on the static behaviour and design of steel <b>drive-in</b> <b>storage</b> racks. The pallet bracing restraints are shown to significantly influence the structural behaviour of the rack, and their effect on the bending moment distribution of the uprights is studied in the paper. The 2 D single upright model proposed by Godley is improved in this study by including the restraints provided by the plan flexural stiffness of the rail beams and the friction between the pallets and rail beams. The improved 2 D model was found to accurately reproduce the bending moment distributions obtained using 3 D advanced finite element analysis. The 2 D single upright model is used to analyse 36 drive-in racks under various load case combinations. The paper evaluates {{the influence of}} the pallet bracing restraints on the ultimate capacity of drive-in racks, clarifies the loading pattern(s) governing the structural design and determines the friction coefficient, or strength of a restraining device, required to prevent the pallets from sliding. It is shown that while restraints from pallets could potentially be considered in design, they would not lead to more economic structural solutions.

40|$|Unlike {{residential}} and commercial buildings, a more effective and rational approach to preventing progressive collapse in storage racks is to sacrifice the bay where a local failure initiates. The cost of a confined collapse of one bay is insignificant compared {{to the cost of}} a progressive collapse. This paper investigates the use of fuse connectors between the portal beams and the uprights of typical <b>drive-in</b> steel <b>storage</b> racks for preventing a local collapse in a bay from propagating to adjacent bays. Through nonlinear dynamic analysis, it identifies the topology and conditions where fuse connectors may be effective...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{a recently}} completed research programme {{carried out at}} the University of Sydney on <b>drive-in</b> steel <b>storage</b> racks subjected to horizontal impact loads. Impact loads develop frequently during the normal operation of drive-in racks when the forklift truck strikes an upright on entering or leaving a bay, and may lead to local or global collapse. The collapse follows the bowing of the upright which may cause a pallet to drop off the supporting beam rails and initiate progressive collapse down through the bay and possibly into adjacent bays as well. The research programme comprised full-scale tests on assemblies of a four-bay-wide racking system, tests on system components, the development of finite element models capable of predicting the behaviour of the system accurately, parametric studies of the strengths and stiffnesses of steel storage racks, {{the development of a}} simple mechanical model for understanding the dynamic behaviour of the system during impact and a reliability analysis for deriving equations for the design impact loads and associated load factors. The purpose of the paper is to give an overview of the methodology adapted for the research programme and to present the main findings and final outcome of the research.

40|$|<b>Drive-in</b> steel <b>storage</b> racks {{represent}} a popular {{alternative to the}} more common selective racks when available space is restricted or when storing the same good. In drive-in racks, the forklift truck drives into the rack and stores the pallets on beam rails on the "first-in last-out" principle. Recent experimental {{studies have shown that}} by acting as horizontal ties between uprights, pallets significantly influence the structural behaviour of the rack. However, due to the uncertainty in the degree of friction between the rail beams and the pallets, current industry design practice does not consider this effect. This paper quantifies the influence of the pallets on the bending moment distribution in the uprights using a 3 D finite element model calibrated against experimental results on a full scale drive-in rack. Additionally, as 3 D models may be computationally intensive when a large number of analyses are required, this paper presents an improved version of the 2 D model of drive-in racks introduced by Godley. In the improved 2 D model, all possible loading scenarios and the influence of pallets on the structural behaviour of the rack are considered. When compared to advanced 3 D finite element analyses, the model is able to accurately reproduce the bending moment distribution in the upright, with and without the presence of pallets.

40|$|The {{stability}} of steel storage racks, {{which are often}} unbraced, may depend solely on the pallet beam to upright connector and on the stiffness of the base plate to floor connection. This paper presents experimental results from cyclic tests performed on portal beam to upright bolted moment connections intended for cold-formed steel <b>drive-in</b> and drive-through <b>storage</b> racks. In storage racks, portal beams are typically connected to uprights by "tab connectors", which are costly to manufacture and experience initial looseness. By simply bolting the portal beams to the uprights, bolted moment connections may represent a cost-effective alternative to "tab connectors". A literature review shows that bolted moment connections between cold-formed steel members are economical and feasible. However, experimental results show {{a significant amount of}} looseness in the connection after an initial high moment-rotational stiffness. Being slender structures, storage racks are sensitive to the second-order P-? effect, and international racking specifications require the initial looseness of the tab connectors to be considered when analysing the {{stability of}} the rack in the down-aisle direction (sway motion). The non-linear cyclic behaviour of bolted moment connections is presented and explained herein. Based on finite element results, it is shown that, for drive-in and drive-through racks, the looseness in bolted moment connections can be ignored in ultimate limit states design. Finally, the paper concludes with proposing two methods, with different degree of complexity, for the design of drive-in and drive-through racks with bolted portal beam to upright bolted moment connections.
