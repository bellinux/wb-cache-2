50|$|A {{cryogenic}} storage dewar (named after James Dewar) is a specialised type of vacuum flask used for storing cryogens (such as liquid nitrogen or liquid helium), whose boiling points are {{much lower than}} room temperature. Cryogenic storage <b>dewars</b> may take several different forms including open buckets, flasks with loose-fitting stoppers and self-pressurising tanks. All <b>dewars</b> have walls constructed from two or more layers, with a high vacuum maintained between the layers. This provides very good thermal insulation between the interior and exterior of the dewar, which reduces {{the rate at which}} the contents boil away. Precautions are taken in the design of <b>dewars</b> to safely manage the gas which is released as the liquid slowly boils. The simplest <b>dewars</b> allow the gas to escape either through an open top or past a loose-fitting stopper to prevent the risk of explosion. More sophisticated <b>dewars</b> trap the gas above the liquid, and hold it at high pressure. This increases the boiling point of the liquid, allowing it to be stored for extended periods. Excessive vapour pressure is released automatically through safety valves. The method of decanting liquid from a dewar depends upon its design. Simple <b>dewars</b> may be tilted, to pour liquid from the neck. Self-pressurising designs use the gas pressure in the top of the dewar to force the liquid upward through a pipe leading to the neck.|$|E

40|$|The {{advantage}} of cryocooler {{is the small}} size of its cold head due to this it can be mounted on top of a <b>Dewar,</b> thus reducing overall size of the liquefier setup making it possible to use it in demanding sites and laboratories where the consumption of liquid nitrogen is not in higher quantities. So the <b>dewar</b> which is mostly used to store liquid cryogen, here is used for production and storage purposes. A cryocooler based Nitrogen liquefaction system was designed and developed which can be an ideal solution to the liquid nitrogen usage in laboratories. This setup uses a Cryomech Single stage Gifford-Mcmahon cryocooler to provide cooling and condensation of nitrogen at 80 K with the refrigeration capacity of 266 W (Rated) at 80 K and a <b>dewar</b> specially fabricated with wider neck than usual <b>dewar</b> to accommodate cold head. The Gifford-Mcmahon cryocooler consist of compressor package, Helium Flex lines and cold head which is {{the heart and soul of}} this setup. The cold head is mounted into the top of the <b>dewar</b> and it extends down into the neck of the <b>dewar</b> for the purpose of cooling the nitrogen entering the <b>dewar</b> to 80 K (- 193 ºC) at 0. 5 bar gauge pressure which is the operating pressure for this <b>dewar.</b> The nitrogen gas liquefies on contact with the cold head heat exchanger. The liquefied nitrogen drips off the heat exchanger down into the <b>dewar.</b> This process would typically lower the pressure inside the <b>dewar,</b> but the regulator allows more nitrogen gas to enter the <b>dewar</b> to maintain the pressure at the preset level. The flow rate of the nitrogen gas into the <b>dewar</b> is controlled by the rate of liquefaction inside the <b>dewar.</b> In the experimental <b>dewar</b> maximum liquefaction rate of 74 Ltr/day and in the main <b>dewar</b> liquefaction rate of 64 Ltr/day were achieved. The difference in liquefaction rate was due to the high radiation load coming on cryogen reservoir of main <b>dewar...</b>|$|R
