Users in 14 countries participated in the 24-hour boycott. The united European campaign aimed for:*"Costs of all telephone calls to more closely mirror the independently audited cost to telecommunications operators of providing these calls, as already mandated by EU law."*"Introduction of <b>flat-rate</b> <b>charges</b> for—in the first instance—local calls, so that anyone can talk to friends and relatives, and Internet users can dial up to Internet Service Providers using a telephone modem, without worrying about the clock ticking and charges ratcheting up."*"For any remaining metered calls, abolition of the minimum call charge so that calls are paid for solely by the time spent connected."*"For Internet users, quicker introduction of modern access methods such as xDSL, cable modems and satellite access, which do not use the telephone modem and are a great improvement on it for users." ...|$|E

50|$|In most, if not all, French cities, {{urban bus}} {{services}} are provided at a <b>flat-rate</b> <b>charge</b> for individual journeys. Many cities have bus services that operate well {{out into the}} suburbs or even the country. Fares are normally cheap, but rural services can be limited, especially on weekends.|$|R

Among usage-based charging schemes, auctionning for bandwidth looks very relevant anymore as it creates congestion (like in the Internet). Among usage-based charging schemes, auctionning for bandwidth looks very promising.

40|$|Recent revelations that ISPs {{selectively}} manipulate P 2 P traffic {{have sparked}} much public discussion. Underlying {{this issue is}} the misalignment of interests between consumers on one hand who desire bulk transfers at flat rates, and ISPs {{on the other hand}} who are bound by budget and capacity constraints. Our thesis is that much of the tension can be alleviated by time-shifting traffic away from peak hours taking advantage of its Delay Tolerant (DT) nature. We propose two solutions for doing this. The first one offers incentives to end-users to shift their DT traffic and yet be compatible with <b>flat-rate</b> <b>charging</b> schemes. The second one posits augmenting the network with additional storage in the form of Internet Post Offices which can let ISPs perform store-and forward relaying of such DT traffic. 1...|$|R
5000|$|The University of Mainz {{does not}} {{currently}} levy fees or tuition (Studiengebühren) for a regular course of study. Senior citizen students, auditing students, and certain postgraduate {{students may be}} subject to fees. The Ministry for Science and Advanced Education introduced [...] "study accounts" [...] (Studienkonten) that were developed jointly with Prof. Zoellner. During the transition period, overdrafts on the account would incur a <b>flat-rate</b> <b>charge</b> of 650 Euro for every overdrawn semester. The Study Accounts allow for a free-of-charge initial course of study {{as long as it does}} not exceed 1.75 times the standard period of study. In a second step the accounts will soon be charged according to time actually used. It is still contested as to whether the enormous administrative burden will lead to an actual improvement of academic conditions. **Measurable success is similar by the introduction of long-term tuition in other federal states and its effect on the decline of nominally enrolled students.|$|R
50|$|These are a {{variation}} on partner-swapping swing clubs with (sometimes, but not always) paid prostitutes in attendance, as well as 'amateur' women and couples. Single men pay a <b>flat-rate</b> entrance <b>charge</b> of about 80 to 150 euros, which includes food, drink and unlimited sex sessions, with the added twist that these are performed in the open {{in full view of}} all the guests. Women normally pay a low or zero entrance charge.|$|R
5000|$|A {{table on}} the GEMA website {{indicates}} {{that most of the}} licensing fees will go down in 2013, but nevertheless a club in Frankfurt with a surface area of 300 m2 (3230 sq. ft.) will currently pay a yearly lump sum between €8,000 and €10,000 for GEMA fees. This would constitute a 500% increase in tariffs. According to a fee-calculator on the website of the Bundesverband Deutscher Discotheken und Tanzbetriebe (Association of German Discos and Dance Venues), the tariffs will be far higher. However, the estimates generated by this calculator indicate the theoretical maximum <b>flat-rate</b> <b>charge</b> per event. Also, this calculator does not take the Angemessenheitsregel (see above) into account, which gives organizers the ability to have their licensing payments based on the actual number of spectators at their events. The numbers that have been disseminated in the media have greatly distorted public perceptions of the consequences of the tariff reforms. Additionally, there is a growing assumption in the media that discos will be especially reluctant to calculate their costs based on spectator-turnout numbers, since these numbers were not previously monitored and likewise not fully counted.|$|R

5000|$|Studies from 2003 {{estimated}} that about 15,000 - 20,000 women work as prostitutes in France.In 2010, {{the number of}} full-time male and female prostitutes was estimated at 20,000 - 30,000, with 80% being foreigners.Sex work in France, like other countries takes many forms. These include street prostitution, escort services, bars and apartment prostitution. Street prostitution is partly controlled by pimps, while other workers are autonomous prostitutes. In some areas, such as Lyon or the Bois de Boulogne in Paris, sex workers use vans (see illustration). The most famous prostitution street in Paris, the la Rue Saint-Denis, has been somewhat gentrified {{in recent years and}} the prostitutes have been moved further north. Escort services where one hires a woman or man for [...] "entertainment" [...] or companionship, but usually including sex, are less common in France, compared to North America. In bars, women try to induce men to buy expensive drinks along with sexual services. Prices are set by the bar owner, and the money is shared between the owner and the prostitute. Pigalle peepshows are well known for practicing such scams. Prostitution in apartments is advertised in adult newspapers and magazines. Swingers' clubs are places where partner-swapping occurs and sometimes paid prostitutes are in attendance, as well as [...] "amateur" [...] women and couples who get in without paying the <b>flat-rate</b> <b>charge</b> of about 80 to 120 euros that men pay, including food, drink and unlimited sex sessions, with the added twist that these are performed in the open in full view of all the guests.|$|R
5|$|The toll {{portion of}} SR 133 employs a barrier toll system, where drivers are <b>charged</b> <b>flat-rate</b> tolls {{based on what}} {{particular}} toll booths they pass through. Tolls are collected at selected on- and off-ramps; and at the Orange Grove Toll Plaza, which spans the on-and off-ramps to Northbound SR 241 (traffic to and from Southbound SR 241 instead pay at the Tomato Springs Toll Plaza located on SR 241 immediately south of the 133/241 interchange).|$|R
40|$|In Southeast Queensland, 75 % of {{households}} have an air-conditioner and 1 -in- 4 detached homes {{now have a}} rooftop Solar PV – {{one of the highest}} take-up rates in the world. Solar PV exceeded all expectations, but underpinning take-up rates are subsidy schemes funded by artificially raising tariffs above the regulated set-point, creating wealth transfers amongst electricity consumers. The structure of the two-part tariff is dominated by a <b>flat-rate</b> variable <b>charge</b> which amplifies wealth transfers through ‘hidden subsidies’. In this article, using interval meter data at the customer switchboard circuit level, an optimal network tariff isolates the incidence of inequitable wealth transfers arising from air-conditioner and solar PV units. Results demonstrate a Demand Tariff substantially increases the efficiency and fairness of the price signal. Above all, a Demand Tariff reduces the structural instability of network prices given a rate-of-return regulatory constraint...|$|R

In the northbound direction, there is a toll in effect after Greenfield Drive, the first ramp north of the highway's terminus. The road employs a barrier toll system, where drivers are <b>charged</b> <b>flat-rate</b> tolls based on what particular toll booths they pass through. Travelers who drive {{the entire length of}} the 73 will only encounter one toll booth, the Catalina View Toll Plaza. Patrons who use an exit along the toll road are charged a prorated toll.|$|R
50|$|The demand {{increase}} in cellular networks {{is fueled by}} a flat rate pricing policy. It promotes heavy-tailed traffic distributions and leads to unbounded demand increase. Nowadays the pricing policy is starting to change because of the unbounded demand increase.Eventually some operators started to <b>charge</b> <b>flat-rate</b> with a cap, {{but this is a}} temporal solution.A more elaborate solution, usage based pricing,is suggested in the literature, but on its own it does not solve the congestion problem in the busy hours.One step further in UIL, a fully dynamic usage-based pricing is suggested.This dynamic price is displayed on a user terminal (UT)so that user can decide to use or not to use the service. The main idea is very clear, the user will generate less traffic when the session price goes up.As a result, the pricing method will change the user behavior and the traffic as in electricity tariffs and smart-grid applicationsand even better than there, because of the immediate feedback and latency in the order of seconds,which allows for best response and training.|$|R
50|$|Switzerland uses a Vignette system {{similar to}} Austria for private vehicles. All {{domestic}} and foreign users of motorways need to purchase such a sticker {{and put it on}} the windshield according to instructions. Only an annual sticker is available, which currently costs 40 CHF, (around 38 Euros as of 10.5.2015) and allows for unlimited travel on the motorway network of the country during the calendar year. The sticker can be purchased at gas stations along the border and other convenience shops in the country. Use of motorway networks without a valid vignette is an offense against the Public Highways Act, and is punishable with cash fines of €190 or more, in addition to the obligatory purchase of an annual vignette. As for trucks and lorries a performance-related heavy vehicle fee (HVF) was introduced in Switzerland on 1 January 2001. This fee replaces the <b>flat-rate</b> heavy vehicle <b>charge</b> that had been levied since 1985 and is based on a law approved by a clear majority of the electorate in September 1998.|$|R
40|$|The {{existing}} {{transport tax}} and charging regime has stimulated limited behavioural change {{and has been}} politically problematic (as demonstrated by the September 2000 fuel duty protests). This project synthesised a range of research that has explored ways in which road user charging could replace the present regime based on taxing fuels and car ownership. In 2002, when this project was proposed, this was a fringe transport policy issue. Throughout 2003 the subject achieved a sudden prominence, with a government working party being established to explore the possibility of long-term area-wide road user charging. A tax regime change towards a car road user charge for cars has occurred, or is being considered, in societies as contrasting as Oregon State in the USA, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the UK, reflecting a range of policy considerations. For the UK, these include: the ongoing failure of transport policy measures to achieve adequate cuts in congestion and emissions; {{the success of the}} London Congestion Charge; the rise in the cost of transport policy interventions; the reduction in Treasury income of eco-reforms to the current tax regime; and the difficulties of, and equity issues relating to, taxing fuel in a future multi-fuel transport sector. The project developed tax change scenarios in conjunction with the project's user group (including policymakers, NGOs and researchers). Five scenarios were modelled using an adaptation of the Dutch Mobility Explorer program. An 'opt-in' transitional policy mechanism involved replacing VED with a small <b>flat-rate</b> kilometre <b>charge</b> for cars of 0. 77 p/km. The model suggested it would have little policy impact, but could be used to familiarise car drivers with the concept of a distance charge. A fiscally neutral scenario involved the replacement of VED and Fuel Duty with a banded kilometre charge for cars of between 2. 3 and 8. 5 p/km (varied by the environmental performance of the vehicle type). This induced little behaviour change, reducing car driver mobility by only 4...|$|R
40|$|The {{successful}} {{operation of}} emerging public wireless LANs requires flexible network mechanisms that can support differentiated or tiered services {{for a variety}} of applications such as bursty transactional web applications as well as reservation demanding voice and video applications. Congestion pricing has been proposed as one promising solution to traffic control because it accurately models the cost that each user's traffic imposes on network congestion points. The underlying assumption of congestion pricing is that users will respond to a monetary-based price signal to maximize their own utility. We observe, however, that monetary service charge is largely a business concern and not a traffic control concern because operators and users prefer simple, predictable, and stable service <b>charges</b> such as <b>flat-rate</b> or block-rate <b>charging.</b> Therefore, we argue, that traffic control techniques such as congestion pricing should be decoupled from monetary service charges. Under such a new regime, however, a user's response to a non-monetary price signal would be quite different from utility maximization, and without the appropriate incentives for users to cooperate such a regime would lead to the "tragedy of the commons" phenomenon, undermining any future differentiated service offerings by wireless Internet service providers. To address this problem we propose wireless incentive engineering mechanisms for mobile devices and access points that provide incentives for mobile users to cooperatively use different classes of services without relying on monetary service charging. Wireless incentive engineering possesses a number of beneficial properties including minimizing the algorithmic and protocol overhead on mobile devices and access points, Nash bargaining fairness, and incentiv [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This report {{analyzes}} {{data from}} the 2006 - 2007 Oregon Road User Fee Pilot program to assess if and how urban form variables correlate with travel behavior changes that participants made {{in response to the}} mileage-based fee program. It finds that charging a noticeably higher fee for driving in congested conditions can successfully motivate households to reduce their VMT in those times and places where congestion is most a problem. Households in both traditional (mixed use, dense, transit-accessible) and suburban (single-use, low density) neighborhoods will likely reduce their peak-hour and overall travel under a charging scheme that charges a high-rate for peak-hour travel, though households in the traditional neighborhoods will do so more. It also finds that a mileage fee program that charges a high rate during the peak hour is likely to strengthen the underlying influence of urban form on travel behavior. In other words, land use probably will matter more to transportation planning if the nation shifts to a new paradigm of mileage-based financing and pricing system. For transportation policy-makers, this raises another layer of consideration when designing the optimal rate structure to achieve policy goals—either reduced VMT and congestion or sustained funding sources. For urban planners, this offers a wonderful opportunity to move towards a sustainable built environment through revised and compatible land use regulation under the context of a mileage-based fee. The research also reveals that program design could significantly affect a household’s response to a mileage-based fee program. Particularly in Portland, the establishment of an endowment account for participants actually increased household VMT when a <b>flat-rate</b> fee was <b>charged,</b> the opposite to policy-makers’ expectation. One possible explanation is that paying the mileage-based fees once a month, instead of paying the gas tax at each visit to the pump, may have encouraged households to drive more due to the reduced gas price at the pump...|$|R
