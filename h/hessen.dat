5|$|The five ships all saw active service during World War I, {{primarily}} as coast defense {{ships in the}} IV Battle Squadron. <b>Hessen</b> {{was transferred to the}} II Battle Squadron in 1916 and took part in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May–1 June 1916. All five ships of the class were retained by the Reichsmarine following Germany's defeat in World War I, and saw further service in a variety of roles. <b>Hessen</b> was eventually rebuilt as a radio-controlled target ship, while Preussen and Lothringen were converted into minesweeper tenders. All of the ships, with the exception of <b>Hessen,</b> were broken up in the 1930s; <b>Hessen</b> survived until the end of World War II, when she was taken over by the Soviet Navy, for continued use as a target ship.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, <b>Hessen</b> saw {{action in}} the Battle of Jutland as the second ship of the III Division of the II Battle Squadron. In the last daytime action between capital ships at Jutland, <b>Hessen</b> and the other pre-dreadnoughts of the II Battle Squadron covered the retreat of Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper's {{battered}} battlecruisers from Vice Admiral David Beatty's battlecruiser squadron. After the battle, the vessel was disarmed and used as a depot ship.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hessen</b> was recommissioned on 1 April 1937 {{and served}} in the Kriegsmarine through World War II.

5|$|On 12 November 1934, <b>Hessen</b> was {{withdrawn}} from fleet service {{and placed in}} reserve. On 31 March 1935, <b>Hessen</b> was stricken from the reserve list and converted into a target ship. Her armament was removed, the hull was lengthened, and new machinery was installed. The longer hull allowed room for two additional watertight compartments, which brought the number up to 15 from the original 13. The ship's superstructure was cut down nearly entirely; <b>Hessen</b> retained only a single funnel, a tower foremast, and the two armored barbettes for the main battery turrets. The ship had a crew of 80, but could be operated by remote control when {{being used as a}} target.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hessen</b> {{participated in}} fleet {{maneuvers}} in February 1908 in the Baltic Sea and more fleet training off Helgoland in May–June. In July, <b>Hessen</b> {{and the rest}} of the fleet sailed into the Atlantic Ocean to conduct a major training cruise. Prince Heinrich had pressed for such a cruise the previous year, arguing that it would prepare the fleet for overseas operations and would break up the monotony of training in German waters, though tensions with Britain over the developing Anglo-German naval arms race were high. The fleet departed Kiel on 17 July, passed through the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal to the North Sea, and continued on to the Atlantic. During the cruise, <b>Hessen</b> stopped at Santa Cruz de Tenerife in the Canary Islands. The fleet returned to Germany on 13 August. The autumn maneuvers followed from 27 August to 12 September. Later that year, the fleet toured coastal German cities as part of an effort to increase public support for naval expenditures. The next year—1909—followed much the same pattern as in 1908. Another cruise into the Atlantic was conducted from 7 July to 1 August, during which <b>Hessen</b> stopped in El Ferrol, Spain. While on the way back to Germany, the High Seas Fleet was received by the British Royal Navy in Spithead. Late in the year, Admiral Henning von Holtzendorff became the commander of the High Seas Fleet. His tenure as fleet commander was marked with strategic experimentation, owing to the increased threat the latest underwater weapons posed and the fact that the new s were too wide to pass through the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal. Accordingly, the fleet was transferred from Kiel to Wilhelmshaven on 1 April 1910.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hessen</b> {{was one of}} the few {{obsolete}} battleships Germany {{was permitted}} to retain under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. She served as a coastal defense ship in the 1920s and early 1930s, though she was withdrawn from front-line service in 1934. The following year, the ship was converted into a radio-controlled target. During World War II <b>Hessen</b> served in this capacity, while also working as an icebreaker in the Baltic and North Seas. The ship was ceded to the Soviet Union in 1946 after the end of the war and, renamed Tsel, served until scrapped in 1960.|$|E

5|$|Starting in 1916, {{the ships}} of the Braunschweig class were {{withdrawn}} from active service, {{primarily because of}} manpower shortages.

Lothringen was withdrawn from service in 1917 and used as an engineer training ship in Wilhelmshaven. Guns removed from these ships starting in 1916 were used by the Imperial Army in World War I as railway guns.|$|E

5|$|Because all of Germany's {{powerful}} dreadnoughts {{had either}} been scuttled in Scapa Flow or ceded to the Allies as war prizes, the Braunschweig-class battleships were recommissioned into the newly reorganized Reichsmarine. In {{the years following}} World War I, Braunschweig, Elsass, and <b>Hessen</b> were to be rebuilt as coastal defense ships, although this plan was abandoned. Braunschweig served in the Reichsmarine from 1921 to 1926, at which point she was withdrawn from active duty. On 31 May 1931, she was stricken and converted into a hulk at Wilhelmshaven, and eventually scrapped. Elsass saw active duty in the fleet from 1924 until 25 February 1930, at which point she was removed from active service. On 31 March 1931, she was stricken, hulked in Wilhelmshaven.

5|$|The Germanic {{tribes are}} thought to date from the Nordic Bronze Age or the Pre-Roman Iron Age. From {{southern}} Scandinavia and north Germany, they expanded south, east and west from the 1st centuryBC, coming {{into contact with the}} Celtic tribes of Gaul as well as Iranian, Baltic, and Slavic tribes in Central and Eastern Europe. Under Augustus, Rome began to invade Germania (an area extending roughly from the Rhine to the Ural Mountains). In 9AD, three Roman legions led by Varus were defeated by the Cheruscan leader Arminius. By 100AD, when Tacitus wrote Germania, Germanic tribes had settled along the Rhine and the Danube (the Limes Germanicus), occupying most of the area of modern Germany; Austria, Baden Württemberg, southern Bavaria, southern <b>Hessen</b> and the western Rhineland, however, were Roman provinces: Noricum, Raetia, Germania Superior, and Germania Inferior.|$|E

Preussen saw active service with the fleet as a minesweeper depot ship from 1919 to 5 April 1929, when she was stricken from the navy list. The ship was sold for breaking on 25 February 1931 for 216,800Mark, and scrapped in Wilhelmshaven. A 63m (68.9yd) section of the hull was kept for use as a torpedo target and other explosives. The hull section was bombed and sunk by Allied aircraft in April 1945. The wreck was eventually raised and scrapped in 1954. Lothringen was also converted into a minesweeper depot ship, and she served in this capacity from 1922 to 1926. The ship was stricken on 31 March 1931, sold for scrapping for 269,650Marks, and broken up by Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.|$|E

500|$|On 24 May, Nürnberg and {{the heavy}} cruiser [...] sailed from Copenhagen under escort by Devonshire, Dido, and several other warships. The {{flotilla}} arrived in Wilhelmshaven on 28 May, and the German vessels remained there while their fates were determined at the Potsdam Conference. The Allies eventually decided to award Nürnberg to the Soviet Union. To prevent the Germans from scuttling their ships as they had done in 1919, the Allies formally seized the vessels on 19 December, while Nürnberg was in drydock. That day, the ship's Soviet crew came aboard. On 2 January, the Soviets took their seized warships, which also included the target ship , <b>Hessens</b> radio-control vessel Blitz, the destroyer Z15 Erich Steinbrinck, and the torpedo boats T33 and T107, to Libau in present-day Latvia.|$|R
50|$|Dudenhofen had {{its first}} {{documentary}} mention in 1278 in an accord from Archbishop Werner von Eppstein of Mainz with the Lords of Eppstein. The village long belonged to various owners {{at the same}} time (the Lords of Falkenstein, Hanau, Isenburg and Electoral Mainz), the odd part was bequeathed, others were traded or mortgaged (complete with inhabitants). Between 1450 and 1736, Dudenhofen belonged to the County of Hanau-Lichtenberg and was assigned to the Amt of Babenhausen, thereby making the place as of 1550 an Evangelical enclave surrounded by Catholic neighbours. The Counts of Hanau-Lichtenberg died out in 1736, whereupon Hesse-Darmstadt and Hesse-Kassel found themselves at odds over the village. In 1771, Dudenhofen was annexed by the County of Hesse-Kassel. Above the main entrance to the Baroque Evangelical church is therefore found Hesse-Kassel’s coat of arms. Underneath the arms is the inscription Was unter <b>Hessens</b> Lust Erbprinz Wilhelm gebaut, sei Dir, o wahrer Gott, zur Pflege nun vertraut (“That built under Hesse’s desire Hereditary Prince William, be it trusted unto Thee, O true God, for its care”).

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the origin of}} archaeological wool textiles preserved by anoxic waterlogging from seven medieval archaeological deposits in north-western Europe (c. 700 - 1600 AD), using geospatial patterning in carbon (δ 13 C), nitrogen (δ 15 N) and non-exchangeable hydrogen (δ 2 H) composition of modern and ancient sheep proteins. δ 13 C, δ 15 N and δ 2 H values from archaeological wool keratin (n = 83) and bone collagen (n = 59) from four sites were interpreted {{with reference to the}} composition of modern sheep wool from the same regions. The isotopic composition of wool and bone collagen samples clustered strongly by settlement; inter-regional relationships were largely parallel in modern and ancient samples, though landscape change was also significant. Degradation in archaeological wool samples, examined by elemental and amino acid composition, was greater in samples from Iceland (Reykholt) than in samples from north-east England (York, Newcastle) or northern Germany (<b>Hessens).</b> A nominal assignment approach was used to classify textiles into local/non-local at each site, based on maximal estimates of isotopic variability in modern sheep wool. Light element stable isotope analysis provided new insights into the origins of wool textiles, and demonstrates that isotopic provenancing of keratin preserved in anoxic waterlogged contexts is feasible. We also demonstrate the utility of δ 2 H analysis to understand the location of origin of archaeological protein samples...|$|R

That corps {{moved toward the}} front and, {{on the night of}} October 1-2, relieved the French 61st Division in the front line. The 2nd Division's 4th Brigade took over the trenches occupied by the French 61st Division and the right battalion of the French 21st Division of the French 11th Corps. The Third Brigade went into a covered position in reserve south of the Butte de Souain-Navarin Farm Ridge. moved into the line to the east. The 2nd Field Artillery Brigade moved up into position in the sector to support an attack on the Massif of Blanc Mont Ridge which was contemplated on the morning of October 2, but postponed until the third. The day was spent in cleaning up Trench [...] "d'Essen", which was still occupied by the Germans the west. Brigadier General Wendell Neville's directions to his Fourth Marine Brigade shows the method of the opening assault. The 6th Marine Regiment was the advance attacking unit of the Fourth Brigade. These tactics were mirrored by the Second Division's Third Brigade on the east flank.

40|$|This thesis {{examined}} how light stable isotopic analysis {{could be used}} to examine the provenance of archaeological wool textiles preserved by anoxic waterlogging. Preliminary studies in modern sheep wool samples showed that their carbon (δ 13 C), nitrogen (δ 15 N), un-exchangeable hydrogen (δ 2 H) and oxygen (δ 18 O) composition varied systematically with geographical location in British Isles and Iceland, but were significantly influenced by farming practice (fodder provision, fertilizer use). Keratin and collagen isotope values within a single sheep were shown to be systematically related. Experimental characterisation of the isotopic effects of wool degradation by elemental, amino acid and isotopic composition showed that changes in experimentally buried samples were minimal compared to samples treated under high-temperature hydrous conditions, which showed significant hydrolysis, oxidation and racemisation. These results were used to interpret data from 101 archaeological textiles from contexts dated between AD 700 - 1600 from excavations at Reykholt, Iceland; York and Newcastle, Britain; <b>Hessens,</b> Germany; and Birka, Sweden. Local isotope range for each location was defined by assemblage median ± maximum variation derived from a modern flock. Isotopic identifications of local/non-local wool did not always correspond to typical/atypical interpretations of textile origin based on features of textile construction, fibre type and dye use. Thus distinctions could be made between the movement of textiles (atypical construction, non-local composition), movement of textile techniques (atypical construction, local composition) and movement of raw wool (typical construction, non-local composition). The most significant limitation of the technique was insufficient isotopic difference between regions of origin and deposition. The results made a significant contribution to understanding the origin of a number of specific textile types, including the much-discussed ‘Frisian cloth’.
