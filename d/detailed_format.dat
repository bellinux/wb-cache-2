50|$|The UI {{specification}} can {{be regarded}} as the document that bridges the gap between the product management functions and implementation. One of the main purposes of a UI specification is to process the product requirements into a more <b>detailed</b> <b>format.</b> The level of detail and document type varies depending the needs and design practices of the organizations. The small scale prototypes might require only modest documentation with high-level details.|$|E

50|$|The term {{bitstream}} {{is frequently}} {{used to describe}} the configuration data to be loaded into a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). This usage may have originated based on the common method of configuring the FPGA from a serial bit stream, typically from a serial PROM or flash memory chip, although most FPGAs also support a byte-parallel loading method as well. The <b>detailed</b> <b>format</b> of the bitstream for a particular FPGA chip is usually considered proprietary to the FPGA vendor.|$|E

Some factors facilitated this migration, e.g. the mapping of the metadata from a verpeny <b>detailed</b> <b>format</b> to a simpler one. The whole project benefited largely from INIST-CNRS previous experience with DSpace and in particular from knowledge about the import of records. Still OpenSIGLE provided INIST-CNRS with a new experience concerning mass uploads on an Open Source platform.|$|E

50|$|The {{content of}} the ETIM model is {{identical}} in all member countries, which means that any ETIM class in use in a country has exactly the same features with the same identifying code for all the countries. However, {{in the past the}} release format was slightly different per country. Because this could and did indeed cause some confusion, ETIM decided to develop a new uniform international release format based on XML, a modern and flexible carrier for the ETIM model. Starting from ETIM 6.0 ETIM IXF will be considered THE international standard ETIM release format. The ETIM IXF format is multilingual, so it can contain multiple language versions of the ETIM model in one file.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo explore {{characteristics}} of written communication guidelines that enhance {{the success of}} training aimed at {{the application of the}} recommendations in the guidelines. MethodsSeven mixed focus groups were held consisting of communication skill teachers and communication skill learners and three groups with only learners. Analysis was done in line with principles of grounded theory. ResultsFive key attributes of guidelines for communication skill training were identified: complexity, level of <b>detail,</b> <b>format</b> and organization, type of information, and trustworthiness/validity. The desired use of these attributes is related to specific educational purposes and learners’ expertise. The low complexity of current communication guidelines is appreciated, but seems ad odds with the wish for more valid communication guidelines. ConclusionsWhich guideline characteristics are preferred by users depends on the expertise of the learners and the educational purpose of the guideline. Practice implicationsCommunication guidelines can be improved by modifying the key attributes in line with specific educational functions and learner expertise. For example: the communication guidelines used in GP training in the Netherlands, seem to offer an oversimplified model of doctor patient communication. This model may be suited for undergraduate learning, but does not meet the validity demands of physicians in training...|$|R
