5|$|Elemental bismuth is denser in {{the liquid}} phase than the solid, a {{characteristic}} it shares with germanium, silicon, gallium and water. Bismuth expands 3.32% on solidification; therefore, {{it was long}} a component of low-melting typesetting alloys, where it compensated for the contraction of the other alloying components, to form almost <b>isostatic</b> bismuth-lead eutectic alloys.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} the rest of Scotland the Firth of Clyde was covered by ice sheets during the Pleistocene ice ages and the {{landscape}} is much affected by glaciation. Arran's highest peaks may have been nunataks at this time. After the last retreat of the ice sea level changes and the <b>isostatic</b> rise of land makes charting post glacial coastlines a complex task but the resultant clifflines behind raised beaches are a prominent feature of the entire coastline.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the last}} twelve {{thousand}} years {{the most significant}} new geological features have been the deposits of peat {{and the development of}} coastal alluvium. Post-glacial rises in sea level have been combined with <b>isostatic</b> rises of the land resulting in a relative fall in sea level in most areas. In some places, such as Culbin in Moray, these changes in relative sea level have created a complex series of shorelines. A rare type of Scottish coastline found largely in the Hebrides consists of machair habitat, a low lying dune pasture land formed as the sea level dropped leaving a raised beach. In the present day, Scotland continues to move slowly north.|$|E
5|$|No traces {{have yet}} {{been found in}} Scotland of either a Neanderthal {{presence}} or of Homo sapiens during the Pleistocene interglacials. The first indications of humans occur only after the ice retreated in the 11th millennium BC and the current Flandrian interglacial began. Since that time the landscape of Orkney has been altered by both human and natural forces. Initially, sea levels were lower than at present due to the large volume of ice that remained. This meant that the Orkney islands may have been attached to the mainland, as was the present-day island of Great Britain to Continental Europe. Much of the North Sea basin was also dry land until after 4000 BC. This would have made travel to northern Scotland relatively easy for early human settlers. The subsequent <b>isostatic</b> rise of land makes estimating post-glacial coastlines a complex task.|$|E

Since that time the landscape of Scotland has been altered dramatically by both human and natural forces. Initially, sea levels were lower than at present due to the large volume of ice that remained. This meant that the Orkney archipelago {{and many of the}} Inner Hebridean islands were attached to the mainland, as was the present-day island of Great Britain to Continental Europe. Much of the present-day North Sea was also dry land until after 4000 BC. Dogger Bank, for example was part of a large peninsula connected to the European continent. This would have made travel to western and northern Scotland relatively easy for early human settlers. The subsequent <b>isostatic</b> rise of land makes estimating post-glacial coastlines a complex task and there are numerous raised beaches around Scotland's coastline.|$|E
25|$|Second, masses {{floating}} {{freely in}} a fluid substratum, like icebergs in the ocean, {{should be in}} <b>isostatic</b> equilibrium (in which the forces of gravity and buoyancy are in balance). But gravitational measurements showed that many areas are not in <b>isostatic</b> equilibrium.|$|E
25|$|Post-glacial rebound (also called either <b>isostatic</b> rebound or crustal rebound) is {{the rise}} of land masses that were {{depressed}} by the huge weight of ice sheets during the last glacial period, through {{a process known as}} <b>isostatic</b> depression. Post-glacial rebound and <b>isostatic</b> depression are different parts of a process known as either glacial isostasy, glacial <b>isostatic</b> adjustment, or glacioisostasy. Glacioisostasy is the solid Earth deformation associated with changes in ice mass distribution. The most obvious and direct effects of post-glacial rebound are readily apparent in parts of Northern Eurasia, Northern America, Patagonia, and Antarctica. However, through processes known as ocean siphoning and continental levering, the effects of post-glacial rebound on sea level are felt globally far from the locations of current and former ice sheets.|$|E

25|$|Glacial <b>isostatic</b> {{adjustment}} {{also plays}} an important role in understanding recent global warming and climate change.|$|E
25|$|Major <b>isostatic</b> {{adjustments}} of the lithosphere {{during the}} Quaternary glaciation {{were caused by}} the weight of the ice, which depressed the continents. In Canada, a large area around Hudson Bay was depressed below sea level, as was the area in Europe around the Baltic Sea. The land has been rebounding from these depressions since the ice melted. Some of these <b>isostatic</b> movements triggered large earthquakes in Scandinavia about 9,000 years ago. These earthquakes are unique in that they are not associated with plate tectonics.|$|E
25|$|In Europe, {{glacial erosion}} and <b>isostatic</b> sinking from weight of ice made the Baltic Sea, which before the Ice Age was all land drained by the Eridanos River.|$|E
25|$|Synthetic {{sapphire}} is {{also produced}} industrially from agglomerated aluminium oxide, sintered and fused (such as by hot <b>isostatic</b> pressing) in an inert atmosphere, yielding a transparent but slightly porous polycrystalline product.|$|E
25|$|Compared {{to other}} regions that were under large ice sheets {{during the last}} glacial period Novaya Zemlya shows {{relatively}} little <b>isostatic</b> rebound. Possibly this is indebted to a counter-effect created by the growth of glaciers {{during the last few}} thousand years.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, the growing {{weight of the}} {{mountain}} belt can cause <b>isostatic</b> subsidence {{in the area of}} the overriding plate on the other side to the mountain belt. The basin type resulting from this subsidence is called a back-arc basin and is usually filled by shallow marine deposits and molasse.|$|E
25|$|The {{factors that}} {{determined}} the sea's characteristics were the submergence or {{emergence of the}} region due to the weight of ice and subsequent <b>isostatic</b> readjustment, and the connecting channels it found to the North Sea-Atlantic, either through the straits of Denmark or at what are now the large lakes of Sweden, and the White Sea-Arctic Sea.|$|E
25|$|The Barnes icecap {{is found}} in {{the central part of the}} Baffin Island and it has been in retreat since at least the early 1960s when the Geographical Branch of the then Department of Mines & Technical Surveys sent a three-man survey team to the area to measure <b>isostatic</b> rebound and cross-valley {{features}} of the Isortoq River.|$|E
25|$|Fabrication {{of targets}} for the ISIS neutron source at the Rutherford-Appleton Laboratory. These {{consisted}} of an assembly of depleted uranium discs clad in zircalloy. The production process involved machining the uranium discs, sealing their zircalloy containers by electron-beam welding, hot <b>isostatic</b> pressing to develop a diffusion bond between the zircalloy and the uranium and then ultrasonic testing to verify {{the integrity of the}} bond before final assembly.|$|E
25|$|The Great Lakes are {{the result}} of glacial scour and pooling of meltwater at the rim of the {{receding}} ice. When the enormous mass of the continental ice sheet retreated, the Great Lakes began gradually moving south due to <b>isostatic</b> rebound of the north shore. Niagara Falls is also a product of the glaciation, as is the course of the Ohio River, which largely supplanted the prior Teays River.|$|E
25|$|The Hebridean {{coastline}} {{has been}} subject to significant post-glacial changes in sea level and the area is rising up at about 2millimetres per annum as <b>isostatic</b> equilibrium is regained. The relative drop in sea-level has left the highest raised sea cave in the British Isles on Ulva at A' Chrannag. At some point, Ulva was probably a west pointing headland of Mull, connected to Gometra and Eilean Dioghlum off the latter's west coast.|$|E
25|$|Midway {{was formed}} roughly 28 {{million years ago}} when the seabed {{underneath}} it was over the same hotspot from which the Island of Hawaii is now being formed. In fact, Midway was once a shield volcano, perhaps as large as the island of Lana'i. As the volcano piled up lava flows building the island, its weight depressed the crust and the island slowly subsided over a period of millions of years, a process known as <b>isostatic</b> adjustment.|$|E
25|$|The {{ridge and}} the bulge {{are the result}} of ancient {{convective}} overturn. This hypothesis states that the bulge is in <b>isostatic</b> equilibrium typical for terrestrial mountains. It means that under the bulge there is material of low density (roots). The weight of the bulge is compensated by buoyancy forces acting on the roots. The ridge is also built of less dense matter. Its position along the equator is probably a result of the Coriolis force acting on a liquid interior of Iapetus.|$|E
25|$|When a {{piece of}} {{lithosphere}} that was heated and stretched cools again, its density rises, causing <b>isostatic</b> subsidence. If this subsidence continues long enough, the basin is called a sag basin. Examples of sag basins are the regions along passive continental margins, but sag basins {{can also be found}} in the interior of continents. In sag basins, the extra weight of the newly deposited sediments is enough to keep the subsidence going in a vicious circle. The total thickness of the sedimentary infill in a sag basins can thus exceed 10km.|$|E
25|$|Based on {{the results}} of {{drilling}} operations on Enewetak (Eniwetok) Atoll, in the nearby Ralik Chain of the Marshall Islands, Bikar may include as much as 4600 feet of reef material atop a basalt rock base. As most local coral growth stops at about 150 feet below the ocean surface, such a massive stony coral base suggests a gradual <b>isostatic</b> subsidence of the underlying extinct volcano, which itself rises 10,000 feet from the surrounding ocean floor. Shallow water fossils taken from just above Enewetak's basalt base are dated to about 55 mya.|$|E
25|$|The Wear {{rises in}} the east Pennines, an upland area raised up during the Caledonian orogeny. Specifically, the Weardale Granite {{underlies}} {{the headwaters of the}} Wear. Devonian Old Red Sandstone in age, this Weardale Granite does not outcrop but was surmised by early geologists, and subsequently proven to exist as seen in the Rookhope borehole. It is the presence of this granite that has retained the high upland elevations of this area (less through its relative hardness, and more due to <b>isostatic</b> equilibrium) and accounts for heavy local mineralisation, although it is considered that most of the mineralisation occurred during the Carboniferous period.|$|E
25|$|The {{observable}} stratigraphic {{record in}} the Discovery quadrangle starts with formation of the intercrater plains, parts of {{which may have been}} coeval with the oldest observable craters. During this period, rates of volcanism were probably high as heat from core formation was being dissipated. If the crust {{was in a state of}} extension, there would have been easy pathways for large volumes of magma to reach the surface. The resulting plasticity of the crust probably caused large numbers of c1 and c2 craters to be destroyed by <b>isostatic</b> adjustment, so the present inventory of c1 and c2 craters may not be complete.|$|E
25|$|The rest of {{the country}} is also still {{emerging}} from the sea. The weight of the continental glaciers depressed the land over which they moved, and even now, a hundred centuries after their recession, Finland is rising up from this great load through the process of <b>isostatic</b> rebound. In the south and the southwest, this process is occurring slowly, at a rate of twenty-five to thirty centimetres a century. Farther north in the Ostrobothnia area, uplift is more rapid, it amounts to eighty or ninety centimetres a century. The process also means that Finland is growing about seven square kilometres yearly as land emerges from the sea.|$|E
25|$|The estuary is shallow {{because of}} this {{constant}} deposition. <b>Isostatic</b> recoil is, however, causing the area to sink {{at the rate of}} 3mm annually and global warming is making the sea level rise. The combined effects of these processes mean that the sea in the estuary may be half a metre higher by the year 2050. A large area around the estuary consists of land which lies below the present high-water mark. Flood defences offer only a short-term and local answer and may actually increase the long-term risks. Managed realignment of the coast by setting back the coastal defences will provide new intertidal habitats and harness natural equalising processes and is the preferred long term solution.|$|E
25|$|Until about 14,000 years ago, Great Britain was {{connected}} to Ireland, and as recently as 8,000 years ago it retained a land connection to the continent, with an area of mostly low marshland joining it to what are now Denmark and the Netherlands. In Cheddar Gorge, near Bristol, the remains of animal species native to mainland Europe such as antelopes, brown bears, and wild horses have been found alongside a human skeleton, 'Cheddar Man', dated to about 7150 BC. Thus, animals and humans must have moved between mainland Europe and Great Britain via a crossing. Great Britain became an island {{at the end of}} the last glacial period when sea levels rose due to the combination of melting glaciers and the subsequent <b>isostatic</b> rebound of the crust.|$|E
25|$|Coarsely lineated ejecta {{blankets}} from Beethoven and Raphael basins {{dominate the}} southern part of the map area. The crater wall of Beethoven is buried by its ejecta blanket and by plains materials. Although the ejecta blankets from both basins are extensive, they are highly asymmetrical and deeply embayed in places by intercrater plains and younger plains units. These embayment relations, together with the discontinuous and subdued appearance of the rim crests and interior walls of the basins, suggest that they are relatively old impact structures. Morphologic appearances may be misleading on Mercury, however, because of the planet’s high temperature and gravity field compared with, for example, those of the Moon. Both of these conditions may promote, particularly on large structures, more rapid <b>isostatic</b> adjustments that would be expressed by subdued topography and the premature “aging” of once-large topographic features. Crater counts, on the other hand, tend to support observed stratigraphic relations.|$|E
25|$|Coastal environments {{during the}} Last Glacial Maximum were complex. The lowered sea level, and an <b>isostatic</b> bulge equilibrated with the {{depression}} beneath the Cordilleran Ice Sheet, exposed the continental shelf {{to form a}} coastal plain. While much of the coastal plain was covered with piedmont glaciers, unglaciated refugia supporting terrestrial mammals have been identified on Haida Gwaii, Prince of Wales Island, and outer islands of the Alexander Archipelago. The now-submerged coastal plain has potential for more refugia. Pollen data indicate mostly herb/shrub tundra vegetation in unglaciated areas, with some boreal forest towards {{the southern end of}} the range of Cordilleran ice. The coastal marine environment remained productive, as indicated by fossils of pinnipeds. The highly productive kelp forests over rocky marine shallows may have been a lure for coastal migration. Reconstruction of the southern Beringian coastline also suggests potential for a highly productive coastal marine environment.|$|E
25|$|By c3 time, {{the rate}} of {{volcanism}} had declined although the impact rate was still high. The preservation of many secondaries1 to 5km across around c3 basins indicates that surface flows that would have obliterated them were highly restricted. However, some degradation of c3 basins occurred by <b>isostatic</b> adjustment. Most of the intermediate plains material formed at this time. Smooth plains material appears to be largely coeval with c4 craters and basins. The crust was under compression during c3 and c4 time, inasmuch as the compressional scarps and ridges post-date some c3 and c4 craters, and are cut by some c4 craters and by c5 craters. Formation of intermediate and smooth plains materials may have been abetted by the c3 and c4 crater- and basin-forming events that opened up temporary magma conduits. One of the latest large impacts was the Caloris event, which occurred {{on the other side}} of the planet from the Discovery quadrangle and which may have initiated formation of the hilly and lineated material within it.|$|E
25|$|Arcuate and radial lineaments {{that might}} result from tectonic {{adjustments}} of the Mercurian crust, following excavation of very large multiring impact basins {{such as the one}} postulated under Borealis Planitia (Boyce and Grolier, 1977), were not unambiguously identified in the Borealis region. On one hand, some ridges {{on the surface of the}} smooth plains material in Borealis Planitia may be of structural (internal) origin; this type of ridge elsewhere on Mercury has been ascribed to compression and a slight shortening of the crust (Melosh, 1977; Melosh and Dzurisin, 1978). On the other hand, the wrinklelike sinuous ridge along the northeast border of the Goethe Basin, together with the outward-facing concentric scarps along its periphery, may represent the fronts of lava flows that are associated with the development of a structural moat between the basin fill and the wall. The latter interpretation supports the view that impact craters and basins on Mercury, as on the Moon (Schultz, 1977) and Mars, “have played a dominant role in controlling the surface expression of igneous activity” (Schultz and Glicken, 1979, p. 8033). Slow, long-lasting <b>isostatic</b> adjustment of the basin floor may have continued well after the emplacement of the basin fill, a structural situation similar to that of crater Posidonius on the Moon (Schaber and others, 1977, Schultz, 1977).|$|E
