5|$|When <b>deoxyhemoglobin</b> {{picks up}} an oxygen molecule, this {{histidine}} residue moves away and returns once the oxygen is securely attached {{to form a}} hydrogen bond with it. This results in the Fe2+ ion switching to a low-spin configuration, resulting in a 20% decrease in ionic radius so that now it can fit into the porphyrin ring, which becomes planar. (Additionally, this hydrogen bonding results in the tilting of the oxygen molecule, resulting in a Fe–O–O bond angle of around 120° that avoids the formation of Fe–O–Fe or Fe–O2–Fe bridges {{that would lead to}} electron transfer, the oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+, and the destruction of hemoglobin.) This results in a movement of all the protein chains that leads to the other subunits of hemoglobin changing shape to a form with larger oxygen affinity. Thus, when <b>deoxyhemoglobin</b> takes up oxygen, its affinity for more oxygen increases, and vice versa. Myoglobin, on the other hand, contains only one heme group and hence this cooperative effect cannot occur. Thus, while hemoglobin is almost saturated with oxygen in the high partial pressures of oxygen found in the lungs, its affinity for oxygen is much lower than myoglobin in the low partial pressures of oxygen found in muscle tissue, resulting in oxygen transfer. This is further enhanced by the concomitant Bohr effect (named after Christian Bohr, the father of Niels Bohr), in which lowered pH (as occurs when carbon dioxide is released in the muscles) further lowers the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin.|$|E
5|$|Hemoglobin is {{an oxygen}} carrier {{that occurs in}} red blood cells and {{contributes}} their color, transporting oxygen in the arteries from the lungs to the muscles where it is transferred to myoglobin, which stores it until it is needed for the metabolic oxidation of glucose, which generates energy. Here the hemoglobin binds to carbon dioxide, produced when glucose is oxidized, which is transported through the veins by hemoglobin (predominantly as bicarbonate anions) back to the lungs where it is exhaled. In hemoglobin, the iron is in one of four heme groups and has six possible coordination sites; four are occupied by nitrogen atoms in a porphyrin ring, the fifth by an imidazole nitrogen in a histidine residue {{of one of the}} protein chains attached to the heme group, and the sixth is reserved for the oxygen molecule it can reversibly bind to. When hemoglobin is not attached to oxygen (and is then called <b>deoxyhemoglobin),</b> the Fe2+ ion {{at the center of the}} heme group (in the hydrophobic protein interior) is in a high-spin configuration. It is thus too large to fit inside the porphyrin ring, which bends instead into a dome with the Fe2+ ion about 55picometers above it. In this configuration, the sixth coordination site reserved for the oxygen is blocked by another histidine residue.|$|E

25|$|It {{is common}} to combine fMRI signal {{acquisition}} with tracking of participants' responses and reaction times.

The fMRI procedure can also be combined with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to have supplementary information about both oxyhemoglobin and <b>deoxyhemoglobin.</b>|$|E
25|$|In both {{hemoglobin}} and myoglobin it {{is sometimes}} incorrectly stated that the oxygenated species contains iron(III). It is now known that the diamagnetic nature of these species is because the iron(II) atom is in the low-spin state. In oxyhemoglobin the iron atom {{is located in the}} plane of the porphyrin ring, but in the paramagnetic <b>deoxyhemoglobin</b> the iron atom lies above the plane of the ring. This change in spin state is a cooperative effect due to the higher crystal field splitting and smaller ionic radius of Fe2+ in the oxyhemoglobin moiety.|$|E
25|$|The {{color of}} {{red blood cells}} {{is due to the}} heme group of hemoglobin. The blood plasma alone is straw-colored, but the red blood cells change color {{depending}} {{on the state of the}} hemoglobin: when combined with oxygen the resulting oxyhemoglobin is scarlet, and when oxygen has been released the resulting <b>deoxyhemoglobin</b> is of a dark red burgundy color. However, blood can appear bluish when seen through the vessel wall and skin. Pulse oximetry takes advantage of the hemoglobin color change to directly measure the arterial blood oxygen saturation using colorimetric techniques. Hemoglobin also has a very high affinity for carbon monoxide, forming carboxyhemoglobin which is a very bright red in color. Flushed, confused patients with a saturation reading of 100% on pulse oximetry are sometimes found to be suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning.|$|E

50|$|Cyanosis {{is defined}} as the bluish or purplish {{discolouration}} of the skin or mucous membranes due to the tissues near the skin surface having low oxygen saturation. Based on Lundsgaard and Van Slyke's work, it is classically described as occurring if 5.0 g/dL of <b>deoxyhemoglobin</b> or greater is present. This was based on an estimate of capillary saturation based on a mean of arterial versus peripheral venous blood gas measurements. Since estimation of hypoxia is usually now based either on arterial blood gas measurement or pulse oximetry, this is probably an overestimate, with evidence that levels of 2.0 g/dL of <b>deoxyhemoglobin</b> may reliably produce cyanosis. Since, however, the presence of cyanosis is dependent upon there being an absolute quantity of <b>deoxyhemoglobin,</b> the bluish color is more readily apparent in those with high hemoglobin counts than it is with those with anemia. Also, the bluer the color, the more difficult it is to detect on deeply pigmented skin. When signs of cyanosis first appear, such as on the lips or fingers, intervention should be made within 3-5 minutes because a severe hypoxia or severe circulatory failure may have induced the cyanosis.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the total concentration of hemoglobin, the oxygen saturation will define the concentration of oxy and <b>deoxyhemoglobin</b> in tissue and so the total absorption spectrum.

50|$|Another way of {{measuring}} hematocrit levels {{has been through}} optical methods such as spectrophotometry has also been developed. Through differential spectrophotometry, the differences in optical densities of a blood sample flowing through small-bore glass tubes at isosbestic wavelengths for <b>deoxyhemoglobin</b> and oxyhemoglobin and {{the product of the}} luminal diameter and hematocrit create a linear relationship that is used to measure hematocrit levels.|$|E
50|$|When 2,3-BPG binds to <b>deoxyhemoglobin,</b> it acts to {{stabilize}} the low oxygen affinity state (T state) of the oxygen carrier. It fits neatly into the cavity of the deoxy- conformation, exploiting the molecular symmetry and positive polarity by forming salt bridges with lysine and histidine residues in the ß subunits of hemoglobin. The R state, with oxygen bound to a heme group, has a different conformation and does not allow this interaction.|$|E
50|$|Neurons do {{not have}} {{internal}} reserves {{of energy in the}} form of sugar and oxygen, so their firing causes a need for more energy to be brought in quickly. Through a process called the hemodynamic response, blood releases oxygen to them at a greater rate than to inactive neurons. This causes a change of the relative levels of oxyhemoglobin and <b>deoxyhemoglobin</b> (oxygenated or deoxygenated blood) that can be detected {{on the basis of their}} differential magnetic susceptibility.|$|E

50|$|Because {{hemoglobin}} is {{a darker}} red {{when it is}} not bound to oxygen (<b>deoxyhemoglobin),</b> as opposed to the rich red color that it has when bound to oxygen (oxyhemoglobin), when seen through the skin it has an increased tendency to reflect blue light back to the eye. In cases where the oxygen is displaced by another molecule, such as carbon monoxide, the skin may appear 'cherry red' instead of cyanotic. Hypoxia can cause premature birth, and injure the liver, among other deleterious effects.|$|E

50|$|Functional MRI (fMRI) {{is used to}} {{understand}} how {{different parts of the}} brain respond to external stimuli or passive activity in a resting state. Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) fMRI measures the hemodynamic response to transient neural activity resulting from a change in the ratio of oxyhemoglobin and <b>deoxyhemoglobin.</b> Researchers use statistical methods to construct a 3-D parametric map of the brain indicating the regions of the cortex that demonstrate a significant change in activity in response to the task. fMRI has applications in behavioral and cognitive research, and in planning neurosurgery of eloquent brain areas.|$|E

50|$|Although most fMRI {{research}} uses BOLD contrast imaging as {{a method}} to determine which {{parts of the brain}} are most active, because the signals are relative, and not individually quantitative, some question its rigor. Other methods which propose to measure neural activity directly have been attempted (for example, measurement of the Oxygen Extraction Fraction, or OEF, in regions of the brain, which measures how much of the oxyhemoglobin in the blood has been converted to <b>deoxyhemoglobin),</b> but because the electromagnetic fields created by an active or firing neuron are so weak, the signal-to-noise ratio is extremely low and statistical methods used to extract quantitative data have been largely unsuccessful so far.|$|E
50|$|CO-oximetry {{is useful}} in {{defining}} the causes for hypoxemia, or hypoxia, (oxygen deficiency at the tissue level). The reporting of multiple hemoglobin moieties or fractions is done with a device that measures absorption of light passing through blood at as few as two or three wavelengths of light {{to as many as}} several dozens of wavelengths to distinguish oxyhemoglobin, and <b>deoxyhemoglobin</b> (formerly called 'reduces' hemoglobin, and thus determine the oxyhemoglobin saturation (the percentage of oxygenated hemoglobin compared to the total amount of available hemoglobin (Hb)). Measurement of greater numbers of wavelengths enables the instrument to distinguish between these and carboxyhemoglobin,-COHb, methemoglobin -metHb, other hemoglobin moieties and 'background' light-absorbing species.|$|E
50|$|In {{red blood}} cells, the enzyme {{carbonic}} anhydrase catalyzes {{the conversion of}} dissolved carbon dioxide to carbonic acid, which rapidly dissociates to bicarbonate and a free proton:CO2 + H2O → H2CO3 → H+ + HCO3−By Le Chatelier's principle, anything that stabilizes the proton produced will cause the reaction to shift to the right, thus the enhanced affinity of <b>deoxyhemoglobin</b> for protons enhances synthesis of bicarbonate and accordingly increases capacity of deoxygenated blood for carbon dioxide. The majority of {{carbon dioxide in the}} blood {{is in the form of}} bicarbonate. Only a very small amount is actually dissolved as carbon dioxide, and the remaining amount of carbon dioxide is bound to hemoglobin.|$|E
