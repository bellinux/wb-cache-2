5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} react vigorously or explosively with cold water, {{producing}} an aqueous solution of a strongly basic alkali metal hydroxide and releasing <b>hydrogen</b> <b>gas.</b> This reaction becomes more vigorous {{going down the}} group: lithium reacts steadily with effervescence, but sodium and potassium can ignite and rubidium and caesium sink in water and generate <b>hydrogen</b> <b>gas</b> so rapidly that shock waves form in the water that may shatter glass containers. When an alkali metal is dropped into water, it produces an explosion, {{of which there are}} two separate stages. The metal reacts with the water first, breaking the hydrogen bonds in the water and producing hydrogen gas; this takes place faster for the more reactive heavier alkali metals. Second, the heat generated by {{the first part of the}} reaction often ignites the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>gas,</b> causing it to burn explosively into the surrounding air. This secondary <b>hydrogen</b> <b>gas</b> explosion produces the visible flame above the bowl of water, lake or other body of water, not the initial reaction of the metal with water (which tends to happen mostly under water). The alkali metal hydroxides are the most basic known hydroxides.|$|E

Moisture evaporated from warm sewage may condense on unsubmerged walls of sewers, {{and is likely}} to hang in partially formed droplets from the horizontal crown of the sewer. As a portion of the <b>hydrogen</b> sulfide <b>gas</b> and oxygen gas from the air above the sewage dissolves into these stationary droplets, they become a habitat for sulfur oxidizing bacteria (SOB), of the genus Acidithiobacillus.

5|$|The raw wound {{fabric of}} silk or cotton was fed from large rollers into Myers' {{varnishing}} machine for processing.

The excess varnish was then removed and the wet fabric cloth hung outdoors in bright sunshine for 6 to 12 hours like laundry. The processed fabric had the elastic properties of rubber. This patented varnish that Myers invented was able to seal the balloon material to hold the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>gas,</b> that otherwise would penetrate even glass and metal. The silk or cloth fabric used required eight to ten applications of the varnish to seal properly to be thoroughly impervious to <b>hydrogen</b> <b>gas.</b>|$|E
5|$|Under {{ordinary}} {{conditions on}} Earth, elemental hydrogen exists as the diatomic gas, H2. However, <b>hydrogen</b> <b>gas</b> {{is very rare}} in the Earth's atmosphere (1 ppm by volume) because of its light weight, which enables it to escape from Earth's gravity more easily than heavier gases. However, hydrogen is the third most abundant element on the Earth's surface, mostly {{in the form of}} chemical compounds such as hydrocarbons and water. <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>gas</b> is produced by some bacteria and algae and is a natural component of flatus, as is methane, itself a hydrogen source of increasing importance.|$|E

40|$|Marun {{oil field}} {{is located in}} the {{southwest}} of Iran and consists of two oil reservoirs named Asmari and Bangestan. Asmari oil reservoir has been producing sweet oil and gas since 1964, {{but for the first time}} a high amount of <b>hydrogen</b> sulfide <b>gas</b> was observed in one well of this reservoir in 1980. Moreover, the Bangestan oil reservoir is located deeper than the Asmari oil reservoir and has been producing sour oil and gas since 1972. This paper represents the conducted study on the determination of hydrogen sulfide oil pollution sources in the Asmari oil reservoir. There are two hypotheses for sources of hydrogen sulfide oil pollution in the Asmari oil reservoir; first, <b>hydrogen</b> sulfide <b>gas</b> migration from Bangestan oil reservoir and second, sour gas injection migration. Data of well souring history, <b>hydrogen</b> sulfide <b>gas</b> concentration of wells, volume of gas injection and RFT analysis were used to investigate these hypotheses. The results showed a similar trend of gas injection volume and <b>hydrogen</b> sulfide <b>gas</b> concentration of wells, which decreased over time. Also, the results demonstrated that the migration of gas injection is a source and cause of spreading of <b>hydrogen</b> sulfide <b>gas</b> in the Asmari oil reservoir...|$|R

5|$|H2 is {{a product}} of some types of {{anaerobic}} metabolism and is produced by several microorganisms, usually via reactions catalyzed by iron- or nickel-containing enzymes called hydrogenases. These enzymes catalyze the reversible redox reaction between H2 and its component two protons and two electrons.
