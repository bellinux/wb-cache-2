Only one of his 44 letter dispatches made it to Zanzibar. One surviving letter to Horace Waller was made available to the public in 2010 by its owner Peter Beard. It reads: [...] "I am terribly knocked up but this <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> own eye only,... Doubtful if I live to see you again..." ...|$|E

We can't believe it would <b>be</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> good; but if it would <b>be</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> happiness, we <b>are</b> willing. Or, if you don't think it's <b>for</b> <b>your</b> happiness, but only for his, and you wish to do it, still we shall be willing, {{and you know that}} as far as your father and I are concerned, there will never be a word of reproach--not a whisper." ...|$|R

"If you're hard upon me, Granville," [...] {{he cried}} at last as he finished, looking wistfully for pity into his son's face, [...] "you should remember, at least, it <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> sake I did it, my boy; it <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> sake I did it--yours, yours, and your mother's." ...|$|R
2500|$|Ned Kelly, {{in company}} with a Mr Living and Constable Richards went to the {{printing}} office. S. Gill, a journalist, when called upon to stand, ran instead and planted himself in the creek. They went to his home, where Richards tried to reassure his wife, and Kelly said, [...] "All I want him for <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> husband to print this letter, the history of my life, and I {{wanted to see him}} to explain it to him." [...] Living said, [...] "For God's sake, Kelly, give me the papers, and I will give them to Gill." [...] (Living never carried out his promise and handed the document to the police instead who published it in a distorted form after Kelly's execution.) Later in the day Kelly relaxed with townspeople at McDougall's.|$|E
2500|$|Lúcia {{said that}} the Lady {{emphasized}} Acts of Reparation and prayers to console Jesus {{for the sins of}} the world. Lúcia said that Mary's words were, [...] "When you make some sacrifice, say 'O Jesus, it <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> love, for the conversion of sinners, and in reparation for sins committed against the Immaculate Heart of Mary.'" [...] At the apparition of 13 July 1917, Lucia said Mary told the children that sinners could be saved from damnation by devotion to the Immaculate Heart, but also by making [...] "sacrifices". They heard her repeat the idea of sacrifices several times. Her vision of hell prompted them to ever more stringent self-mortifications to save souls. Among many other practices, Lúcia wrote that she and her cousins wore tight cords around their waists, flogged themselves with stinging nettles, gave their lunches to beggars, and abstained from drinking water on hot days. Francisco and Jacinta became extremely devoted to this practice. Lúcia wrote that Mary said God was pleased with their sacrifices and bodily penances.|$|E
