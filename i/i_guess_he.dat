500|$|Generally, {{critics and}} fans were {{disappointed}} Mr. Eko was killed after {{being on the}} show for only one season. Kristin Dos Santos of E! called Mr. Eko [...] "the best character of the show", and was therefore very disappointed with his death. In response to Mr. Eko's death, Christine Fenno of Entertainment Weekly stated [...] "I'll miss Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje—his acting was up there with Terry O'Quinn's, Elizabeth Mitchell's, and Michael Emerson's. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> was the sacrifice the island demanded". Writing for Zap2it, Rick Porter said that his death [...] "sucked hard, and loud, and long". IGN listed Eko's death as number one on its list of [...] "Top 10 Lost Deaths".|$|E
500|$|The {{musical score}} for Hulk was {{composed}} by Danny Elfman, who scored Spider-Man the previous year. Frequent Ang Lee collaborator, Mychael Danna, {{was the original}} composer for the film. However, Danna's score was rejected by studio executives for its non-traditional approach, which featured Japanese taiko, African drumming, and Arabic singing. Elfman was then approached by Universal's president of film music, Kathy Nelson. With 37 days to compose over two hours of music, Elfman agreed out of respect to Lee. While instructing to retain much {{of the character of}} Danna's score, Lee pushed Elfman to write material that did not sound like his previous superhero scores. [...] "They did leave some of my music in the movie," [...] said Danna, [...] "so the Arabic singing and some of the drumming is mine. What happened is that they panicked, they brought in Danny and he heard what I've been doing and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> liked it." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Ragan, who was {{involved}} in the race's largest accident, [...] "Everybody was real racy and I just got into the back of Menard. You get a good run, and you're pushing a little bit, and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> was pushing whoever was in front of him. And when you've got the meat in between the sandwich, you usually get wrecked." [...] Harvick blamed the accident on drivers who had little experience of pack racing: [...] "The biggest problem is the tandem racing has been so easy for these guys to stay attached that some of them haven't raced in pack racing. It's {{going to take a lot}} more patience from a lot of guys who haven't done this before." [...] Nevertheless, Menard thought that the pack style of racing would be a good combination for the Daytona 500 and believed it would be [...] "chaotic" [...] and [...] "exciting". Four days after the race, NASCAR announced that the pressure relief values in the engine would be increased from [...] to [...] after some drivers complained of overheating issues while they were running in packs. The race had a television audience of 7.46million viewers.|$|E
500|$|Bible Student Alexander H. Macmillan, {{who served}} as an aide to the {{executive}} committee, later wrote that tensions at the Watch Tower Society headquarters mounted as the day for election of the Society's officers approached. He wrote: [...] "A few ambitious ones at headquarters were holding caucuses here and there, doing a little electioneering to get their men in. However, Van Amburgh and I held {{a large number of}} votes. Many shareholders, knowing of our long association with Russell, sent their proxies to us to be cast for the one whom we thought best fitted for office." [...] Macmillan, who claimed he had declined an offer from an ailing Russell months earlier to accept the position of president after his death, agreed with Van Amburgh that Rutherford was the best candidate. According to Macmillan, [...] "Rutherford did not know what was going on. He certainly didn't do any electioneering or canvassing for votes, but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> was doing some worrying, knowing if he was elected he would have a big job on his hands ... There is no doubt in our minds that the Lord's will was done in this choice. It is certain that Rutherford himself {{had nothing to do with}} it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Truesdale {{had kind}} words for his successor, Peter J. Hurtgen. [...] "He's not an ideologue," [...] Truesdale said in October 2002. [...] "He {{came from a}} {{management}} background, and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> himself would tell you he was a conservative Republican and a management-oriented person. But he was always very fair." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Did I meet him? Why, {{he almost}} ran into me and didn't see me at all. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he's</b> running yet. Now, what's the joke?" [...] Peter demanded.|$|R
6000|$|... "Married? I {{never thought}} of that. But no, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he's</b> not. He'd have {{mentioned}} it. He's not the sort to hush up a thing like that. I--" ...|$|R

2500|$|The Coen {{brothers}} said idiocy {{was a major}} {{central theme}} of Burn After Reading; Joel {{said he and his}} brother have [...] "a long history of writing parts for idiotic characters" [...] and described Clooney and Pitt's characters as [...] "dueling idiots." [...] Burn After Reading is the third Coen brothers film for Clooney (O Brother, Where Art Thou? and Intolerable Cruelty), who acknowledged that he usually plays a fool in their movies: [...] "I've done three films with them and they call it my trilogy of idiots." [...] Joel said after the last scene was shot, [...] "George said: 'OK, I've played my last idiot!' So <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> won't be working with us again." [...] Clooney returned to act in another Coen brothers film, Hail, Caesar!.|$|E
2500|$|King {{has been}} {{involved}} in many litigation cases with boxers that were focused on fraud. In 1982 he was sued by Muhammad Ali for underpaying him $1.1 million for a fight with Larry Holmes. King called in an old friend of Ali, Jeremiah Shabazz, and handed him a suitcase containing $50,000 in cash and a letter ending Ali's lawsuit against King. He asked Shabazz to visit Ali (who was in the hospital due to his failing health) and get him to sign the letter and then give Ali the $50,000. Ali signed. The letter even gave King the right to promote any future Ali fights. According to Shabazz, [...] "Ali was ailing by then and mumbling a lot. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> needed the money." [...] Shabazz later regretted helping King. Ali's lawyer cried when he learned that Ali had ended the lawsuit without telling him.|$|E
2500|$|Said Zev Buffman, a Broadway {{producer}} and financier for Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, [...] "When Andy {{was at the}} theater, he was a joy. But he wasn't there enough," [...] adding that of the five people to play Joseph up to that point, Gibb was the best actor. He also said after Gibb's death, [...] "We'd lose him over long weekends. He'd come back on Tuesday, and he'd look beat. He was like a little puppy – so ashamed when he did something wrong. He was all heart, but he didn't have enough muscle to carry through." [...] An unnamed co-star in Dreamcoat was quoted as saying, [...] "I hear {{he spent most of}} his time in his hotel room in front of the TV. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> was frightened and insecure. That's what happens when you're the baby brother of the Bee Gees." [...] Commenting after Gibb's death, Solid Gold producer Brad Lachman stated, [...] "... was a very charming, vulnerable and charismatic performer. He clearly meant well. He wasn't being difficult. He was going through problems he couldn't deal with. He wanted everyone to love him. He had so much going for him, and he just couldn't believe it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he's</b> {{going to}} be, anyhow," [...] Mr. Bender cordially struck in; [...] "and this {{remarkable}} exhibition of intelligence may {{just let him}} loose on the world, mayn't it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Buck up, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he's</b> {{all right}} really. Why shouldn't he be? See here, {{it was a}} foreign-looking guy he went off after. Maybe they've gone abroad--to Poland, or {{something}} like that?" ...|$|R

2500|$|The album {{includes}} {{production from}} Cole himself, alongside Brian Kidd, No I.D. and L Music Cole wants his fans {{to expect a}} different sound, while he speaks about topics {{that have never been}} included in mainstream hip hop music before. The Source magazine said that Cole's [...] "evolution as a producer solely enhances the product" [...] and that [...] "Outside of co-production from No I.D., this album is all Cole at his rawest. Cole said the production on the song, called [...] "Lost Ones" [...] was influenced by New Zealand music artist Alex Gilbert. The album also features live Orchestra and Musical Sections arranged and produced by Larrance Dopson of 1500 or Nothin', with violin recorded by Ginny Luke on them songs, such as [...] "Rise and Shine", [...] "Lost Ones" [...] and [...] "Breakdown". During the final moments of working on his album, when Cole had lost hope for his dream collaboration with Jay-Z, he explained to Vibe how the collaboration came to fruition, [...] "He was in L.A. and I got [...] that day around the VMAs or whatever. He actually pushed back the mastering, we went to mastering with no Jay-Z verse. I was like 'oh okay cool, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>he</b> can't do it.' They were mastering the last song, and this is such a Jay-Z move, he called in and stopped the mastering and pushed it back like a week. Only he can do that." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It's possible," [...] the {{sergeant}} agreed {{with a touch}} of dryness. [...] "Maybe the bosses were after Stannard. But I don't get it all yet.
