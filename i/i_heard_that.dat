25|$|On October 17, 2017 Frank Ocean's dad, Calvin Cooksey, sued Frank {{on charges}} of {{defamation}} and other damages with restitution payments reaching up to 14.5 million dollars. The issue started when Frank Ocean wrote a post in his personal Tumblr responding to the Pulse Nightclub shooting back in June 2016 and told {{a story about how}} when he was a kid, he heard his father use a transphobic slur towards a waitress. The post stated that:'I was six years old when I heard my dad call our transgender waitress a f***** as he dragged me out a neighborhood diner saying we wouldn’t be served because she was dirty. 'That was the last afternoon I saw my father and the first time <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> word, I think, although it wouldn’t shock me if it wasn’t. Many hate us and wish we didn’t exist.' The judge ended up ruling in favor of Frank Ocean and the case was put to an end.|$|E

25|$|Legend {{holds that}} the Archangel Michael {{appeared}} atop the mausoleum, sheathing his sword {{as a sign of}} the end of the plague of 590, thus lending the castle its present name. A less charitable yet more apt elaboration of the legend, given the militant disposition of this archangel, was heard by the 15th-century traveler who saw an angel statue on the castle roof. He recounts that during a prolonged season of the plague, Pope Gregory <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> the populace, even Christians, had begun revering a pagan idol at the church of Santa Agata in Suburra. A vision urged the pope to lead a procession to the church. Upon arriving, the idol miraculously fell apart with a clap of thunder. Returning to St Peter's by the Aelian Bridge, the pope had another vision of an angel atop the castle, wiping the blood from his sword on his mantle, and then sheathing it. While the pope interpreted this as a sign that God was appeased, this did not prevent Gregory from destroying more sites of pagan worship in Rome.|$|E

When first presented with the proposal of his label moving the release date of his album yet again {{as well as the}} idea of a sales competition between him and 50 Cent, West initially expressed his indifference towards the thought, saying, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> thing about the debate, I thought that was the stupidest thing.

[...] Philosophically opposed to the American Medical Association's stance that its own type of medical practice was the only legitimate one, he spoke in favor of licensing for osteopaths. Physicians from the New York County Medical Society responded with a vigorous attack on Twain, who retorted with [...] "he physicians think they are moved by regard for {{the best interests of the}} public. Isn't there a little touch of self-interest back of it all?" [...] "...The objection is, people are curing people without a license and you are afraid it will bust up business." ...|$|E

Coto compared the character to Hannibal Lecter and talked about the fear that he inspired in the human authorities during the time of Enterprise due to Soong's actions involving illegal genetics. The storyline involved several references to The Original Series, such as the genetic supermen in the vein of Khan Noonien Singh as first seen in the episode [...] "Space Seed" [...] and later in the 1982 film, [...] The first episode of this Enterprise story arc also saw the re-appearance of the Orion slave girls as seen in the first pilot of Star Trek, [...] "".

500|$|Branch's {{music has}} gained {{prominence}} {{as a result}} of its use during the 2012 Republican presidential primary.

[...] "I Am America" [...] was later adopted by the candidate as his campaign's official theme. Cain said when interviewed about the song, [...] "The first time <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> song, the message was so right-on I felt goose bumps just listening to it." [...] The song was later described by the National Journal as having [...] "underscored Cain's anti-elitist appeal" [...] with its lyrics. Campaign ads featuring [...] "I Am America" [...] gave the song increased exposure. A campaign ad using [...] "I Am America" [...] that included Cain's chief of staff was the subject of numerous parodies also featuring the song. On The Colbert Report, comedian Stephen Colbert satirically claimed Cain got the line [...] "I Am America" [...] from Colbert's book, I Am America (And So Can You!).

[...] Jerry Belson and Spielberg wrote the shooting script together. In the end, Spielberg was given solo writing credit. During pre-production, the title was changed from Kingdom Come to Close Encounters of the Third Kind. J.

Hynek felt [...] "even though the film is fiction, it's based for the most part on the known facts of the UFO mystery, and it certainly catches the flavor of the phenomenon.

[...] USAF and NASA declined to cooperate on the film. In fact, NASA reportedly sent a 20-page letter to Spielberg, telling him that releasing the film was dangerous.

500|$|For her {{portrayal}} of Valene, Van Ark received two Soap Opera Digest awards {{in the category}} [...] "Outstanding Actress in a Leading Role on a Prime Time Serial". Greg Hernandez said, [...] "Before I go on, I have to confess that I was a die-hard fan of Knots Landing, the series on which Joan played sweet Valene Ewing for 14 years. Her character of Valene was a best-selling author but her personal life was always a mess. She had her husband, Gary, stolen by another woman then got pregnant by him, her twin babies were kidnapped by a crooked doctor, she was given a drug overdose at gunpoint by her ex-husband's fiancee, and she racked up enough marriages to give Elizabeth Taylor a run for her money. But she and Gary Ewing (Ted Shackleford) made for one of television's most beloved couples and the audience never stopped rooting {{for them to get}} back together. Joan keeps in touch with Ted (pictured with Joan, above at a [...] "Knots" [...] reunion a few years back), Michelle Lee - who played her best friend Karen - and the great stage star Julie Harris who played her mother." [...] Knots Landing itself has experienced a tremendous fan following and dedication. Van Ark said of this, [...] "It’s amazing. It’s like having friends everywhere in the United States. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> a group a fans from London were coming in just to see us at this (autograph convention). We get a lot of fan mail from Europe – France, Germany, Russia. Knots has a huge following, and I think fans of the show are loving and loyal. Not many shows last 14 years on prime-time. That’s a milestone, and I’m very proud of it." ...|$|E
500|$|Clarkson shares writing credits on six {{songs from}} Breakaway. [...] "Breakaway" [...] was {{included}} as the album's opening and title track.

Whenever writers or producers come to work with me, they take advantage of the fact that I can really belt it out. What's cool about 'Breakaway' is that it doesn't take advantage of that. The song just uses the simplicity of my voice. I've done country music, I've done pop, I've done gospel... all of my singles have sounded different. But this song was different from everything I've done; people didn't even know it was me!" [...] Written by Max Martin and Dr. Luke, Clarkson described the second track [...] "Since U Been Gone", as [...] "not as [...] "smooth" [...] as pop or R Clarkson said of the track, the very last to be recorded for the album, [...] "It's very emotional. Vocally, it can be a lot more challenging, but is very fun to play live." [...] Written by Clarkson, Dr. Luke, and Martin, the third track, [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes", was the last song she had co-written for the album. She recalled, [...] "I wrote 'Behind These Hazel Eyes' about my last boyfriend. It's the last song I wrote for the album, I almost didn't make the deadline." [...] The fourth track, [...] "Because of You", was originally intended for Thankful. Clarkson wrote a draft of the song after a late night talk with a friend who had hard time with her family, with Moody and Hodges providing additional writing. [...] "Gone", the fifth track, was written by Kara DioGuardi and John Shanks. Clarkson admits she cannot relate thoroughly to the song, but felt that it should be heard nonetheless. The sixth track, [...] "Addicted", was written by Clarkson, Ben Moody, and David Hodges. Clarkson revealed that the song was inspired by the songs featured on Evanescence's debut album Fallen (2003).
