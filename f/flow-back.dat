40|$|After fluid {{injection}} (slickwater) during hydraulic fracturing, the <b>flow-back</b> of fracture fluid {{is necessary}} before gas production starts. A review of fracture treatments {{indicates that the}} incomplete return of treating fluids is {{a reason for the}} failure of hydraulic fracturing and is associated with poor gas production. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the parameters that limit <b>flow-back</b> in low permeability gas wells in the Cooper Basin. The authors used numerical simulation to find the critical controlling parameters to introduce the best practice for maximising the <b>flow-back</b> in the Cooper Basin. Several 3 D and multiphase flow simulation models were constructed for three wells in the Patchawarra Formation during fracture fluid injection, soaking time and during <b>flow-back.</b> All models were validated using history matching with the production data. The results show that the drainage pattern is distinctly different in the following directions: vertically upward, vertically downward, and horizontal along the fracture half-length and along the matrix. The lowest recovery is observed during the upward vertical displacements due to poor sweep efficiency. Furthermore, it is observed that drawdown does not influence the recovery significantly for upward displacements. Surface tension reduction, however, can improve sweep efficiency and improve recovery considerably. Also, the wettability of the rocks has a significant impact on ultimate recovery when the effect of gravity is dominant. The authors conclude that a significant amount of injected fluid is trapped in the formation because of poor sweep efficiency and formation of gas fingers, which results from low mobility ratio and gravity segregation.

40|$|The world’s growing {{population}} results in increased energy needs that cannot yet be fully {{supported by the}} renewable sources of energy. These modern conditions and restraints have created the need to further research methods to enhance the recovery of resources previously unavailable due to technical and/or economic reasons and to reduce {{the environmental impacts of}} using fossil fuels. In this dissertation, applications of electrokinetic phenomena for the improvement of subsurface energy resource extraction are investigated using experimental and numerical tools. Electrodialysis is proposed as a method of pre-treatment of the <b>flow-back</b> water produced during fracturing stage of shale gas extraction. The method targets the reduction of Total Dissolved Solids levels in the <b>flow-back</b> water so that it can either be treated further or be reused directly. The treatment and reuse of the <b>flow-back</b> water can potentially improve the sustainability of the shale gas extraction, controlling the amounts of water used and the general environmental footprint of the process. In addition, the electrically assisted oil recovery is investigated as a potential technique for the enhancement of oil extraction, especially for the case of heavy crude oil. The high viscosity and low mobility of heavy crude oil render it almost impossible or not economical to extract. The method uses the application of low electrical field (direct current) to the oil reservoir to facilitate and increase the oil recovery by taking advantage of the mechanisms involved in electrokinetic phenomena...|$|E
40|$|In the Netherlands {{two black}} shales (Carboniferous Geverik member and Toarcian Posidonia formation) are {{considered}} {{for the production of}} shale gas. The techniques involved, hydraulic fracturing and high density horizontal directional drilling may result in the production of substantial amounts of drill cuttings, <b>flow-back</b> water and produced water. In the USA shale gas waste water can contain high concentrations of total dissolved solids, salt, heavy metals and naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM) and should be handled with care. Through the experience from the USA there are concerns in the Netherlands about the safety of storage and disposal of those <b>flow-back</b> waters. There is currently no knowledge on the composition of <b>flow-back</b> waters produced by hydraulic fracturing in the Netherlands. As the produced water qualities in the USA show a wide range of compositions, this study focuses on the possibility to predict the <b>flow-back</b> water composition {{on the basis of the}} chemical composition of the shales for the Geverik Member and Posidonia formation as well with the results from leaching experiments. This is done by first analyzing the inorganic chemical composition of the shales and how they vary with location. The depositional environment of the shales were assessed using different inorganic proxies. From this set of samples three representative samples were used to perform a leaching experiment under oxic and oxygen depleted conditions, to determine which elements were released from the shale and which processes were causing those releases. The knowledge of how the elements are leached out of the shales is not only interesting for the environmental hazard and treatment requirements for the composition of the <b>flow-back</b> waters, but also for how to clean and/or store the drilling waste safely. Based on the chemical composition the Posidonia shale in the Netherlands can be divided into two groups: the North-Brabant (NB) Posidonia and the South-Holland (SH) Posidonia both deposited under marine environments. However, SH Posidonia has a larger terrestrial input compared to NB Posidonia. The Geverik shale has higher enrichments of multiple trace elements compared to the Posidonia and contains more pyrite. Correspondingly, more pyrite oxidized in the Geverik sample during the oxic experiment but this has not resulted into higher releases of trace elements. It is suggested that the trace elements were released by the decomposition of organic matter or due to desorption from the silicate fraction. The solutions from the batch experiments are alkaline (pH> 7) and contain low TDS concentrations (with Ca, HCO 3 -, SO 42 - and Na as the dominant ions). The processes that are indentified in the experiments are dissolution of calcite and other highly soluble minerals, cation exchange and trace metal adsorption/desorption. Other process that take place in the oxic experiments are pyrite oxidation and ammonium oxidation, while in the oxygen depleted experiments also the reduction of organic matter and Mn-oxides takes place. The salt concentrations in the experiments were relatively low, this support the hypothesis from Blauch et al. (2009) that the high total dissolved solids, often found in <b>flow-back</b> waters, are caused by in situ brines from reservoirs adjacent to the shales that are reached during hydraulic fracturing...|$|E

40|$|The {{volcanic}} reservoir is {{an important}} kind of unconventional reservoir. The aqueous phase trapping (APT) appears because of fracturing fluids filtration. However, APT can be autoremoved for some wells after certain shut-in time. But there is significant distinction for different reservoirs. Experiments were performed to study the petrophysical properties of a volcanic reservoir and the spontaneous imbibition is monitored by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and pulse-decay permeability. Results showed that natural cracks appear in the samples as well as high irreducible water saturation. There is a quick decrease of rock permeability once the rock contacts water. The pores filled during spontaneous imbibition are mainly the nanopores from NMR spectra. Full understanding of the mineralogical effect and sample heterogeneity benefits the selection of segments to fracturing. The fast <b>flow-back</b> scheme is applicable in this reservoir to minimize the damage. Because lots of water imbibed into the nanopores, the main flow channels become larger, which are beneficial to the permeability recovery after <b>flow-back</b> of hydraulic fracturing. This is helpful in understanding the APT autoremoval after certain shut-in time.

The fracturing fluid used in hydraulic fracturing or frac pack contain a chemical breakers to reduce the viscosity of the fluid intermingled with the proppant. Chemical breakers reduce viscosity of the guar polymer by cleaving the polymer into small-molecular-weight fragments. The reduction of viscosity will facilitate the <b>flow-back</b> of residual polymer providing rapid recovery of polymer from proppant pack. Ineffective breakers or misapplication of breakers can result in screen-outs or <b>flow-back</b> of viscous fluids both of which can significantly decrease the well productivity. Breaker activity of low to medium temperature range oxidative and enzyme breaker systems was evaluated.

40|$|The rate of {{the trace}} {{distance}} is used to evaluate quantum speed-up for arbitrary mixed states. Compared with some present methods, {{the approach based on}} trace distance can provide an optimal bound to the speed of the evolution. The dynamical transition from no speed-up region to speed-up region takes on in the spontaneous decay of an two-level atom with detuning. The evolution is characteristic of the alternating behavior between quantum speed-up and speed-down in the strong system-reservoir coupling regime. Under the off-resonance condition, the dynamical evolution can be accelerated for short previous times and then decelerated to a normal process either in the weak or strong coupling regime. From the time-energy uncertainty relation, we demonstrate that the potential capacity for quantum speed-up evolution is closely related to the energy <b>flow-back</b> from the reservoir to the system. The negative decay rate for short time intervals leads to the speed-up process where the photons previously emitted by the atom are reabsorbed at a later time. The values of the spontaneous decay rate becomes positive after a long enough time, which results in the normal evolution with no speed-up potential. Comment: 18 pages, 6 figure...|$|E

40|$|Fracturing fluid is an {{essential}} component of hydraulic fracturing stimulation. The oil and gas industry has experienced transformation in fluid technology for hydraulic fracturing. Fracturing fluid should have the reasonable viscosity that can suspend and transport proppants into the fracture. It should also be able to keep the fracture open throughout the life of the well. Sometimes ago polymers were used for this purpose as it's able to withstand high temperature under well condition. However due to formation of filter cake caused by the polymer based fluids, there are formation and conductivity damages to the formation, therefore its application in fracking a bit limited. Viscoelastic surfactant (VES) were then applied in fracturing operation as they exhibit viscous and elastic behavior in brine (increased viscosity) by entanglement of the VES micelles, but its viscosity is drastically reduced at high temperature. Then additions of inorganic or organic nanoparticles have been found to help in stabilizing the viscosity of this VES fluid at very harsh condition of high temperature and pressure. Internal breakers are also added to the VES fluid to help break the fluid into low viscosity fluid after fracturing has been completed so as to enhance easy <b>flow-back</b> (cleanup) of VES to the surface.

Although the stunning range of research enhancement and substantial technology development has concentrated on treatment methodologies to illustrate and investigate the optimum quality of water produced by removing unnecessary internal materials thereby, it would be beneficial for further procedures and operations. These alternative elections contain water reuse in oil and gas operations, municipal, agricultural, and industrial processes. The Lower amount of dissolved solids produced water must be under 30, 000  ppm TDS which may be feasible to treat in other activities outside of oil and gas operations. Higher dissolved solid produced waters contain more than 30, 000  ppm TDS, and this is why the high salinity content that is kept in solution with water should be virtually eliminated.|$|E
40|$|In-situ {{stresses}} are {{key information}} for well and formation integrity assessments, especially in difficult drilling operations {{such as high}} pressure high temperature wells, extended reach wells and in-fill drilling. During drilling, the minimum horizontal stress is best obtained by dedicated tests. In particular the extended leak-off test. Challenges associated with such tests are the quality of stress data obtained in complex stress regimes, difficult formations (plasticity, ductility, thermal effects) and difficult geometries. These conditions present the need for more reliable determination of in-situ stresses during drilling. This thesis was part of the full development of an extended leak-off test simulator for deep wells based on a modified discrete element method (MDEM) at SINTEF Petroleum. The overlying objective of MDEM as a fracturing simulator is modelling of dynamic fracture initiation and propagation in 3 D. XLOT in deviated wells may be evaluated for information, and phenomena such as fracture twisting may be captured. The process of refining MDEM to become an XLOT simulator in low-permeable rock in 2 D is described with results and discussion. In low permeability formations, the only volume available for the well fluid to flow into is the induced fracture volume. With single phase water as fracturing fluid in an open hole segment of unit length (modelled by MDEM, in 2 D), this corresponds to a highly stiff and non-linear system, where fracture mechanics and fluid flow are intimately coupled. Change in flow rate immediately translates to fracturing rate. A full well volume attached to the fracturing simulator implies that decompressed volume will flow at high rates into the fracture at formation breakdown, inducing a large fracture. A sequentially coupled geomechanical and fluid flow model requires limited fracture extension per simulation timestep to ensure a stable hydromechanical coupling, which makes coupling of third model, the well, a non-trivial problem. Two schemes to couple a deep petroleum well to the MDEM fracturing simulator were developed in MATLAB, and applied to simulate XLOT in a 2000 mTVD well.

40|$|The project {{goal was}} to develop a {{cost-effective}} water recovery process to reduce the costs and envi-ronmental impact of shale gas production. This effort sought to develop both a flowback water pre-treatment process and a membrane-based partial demineralization process for the treatment of the low-Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) portion of the flowback water produced during hydrofracturing operations. The TDS cutoff for consideration in this project is < 35, 000 {approx} 45, 000 ppm, which is the typical limit for economic water recovery employing reverse osmosis (RO) type membrane desalination processes. The ultimate objective is the production of clean, reclaimed water suitable for re-use in hydrofracturing operations. The team successfully compiled data on flowback composition and other attributes across multiple shale plays, identified the likely applicability of membrane treatment processes in those shales, and expanded the proposed product portfolio to include four options suitable for various reuse or discharge applications. Pretreatment technologies were evaluated at the lab scale and down-selected based upon their efficacy in removing key contaminants. The chosen technologies were further validated by performing membrane fouling studies with treated flowback water to demonstrate the technical feasibility of flowback treatment with RO membranes. Process flow schemes were constructed {{for each of the four}} product options based on experimental performance data from actual flowback water treatment studies. For the products requiring membrane treatment, membrane system model-ing software was used to create designs for enhanced water recovery beyond the typical seawater desalination benchmark. System costs based upon vendor and internal cost information for all process flow schemes were generated and are below target and in line with customer expectations. Finally, to account for temporal and geographic variability in flowback characteristics as well as local disposal costs and regulations, a parametric value assessment tool was created to assess the economic attractiveness of a given flowback recovery process relative to conventional disposal for any combination of anticipated flowback TDS and local disposal cost. It is concluded that membrane systems in combination with appropriate pretreatment technologies can provide cost-effective recovery of low-TDS <b>flow-back</b> water for either beneficial reuse or safe surface discharge...|$|E
40|$|Worldwide rising gas {{demand is}} {{creating}} {{new opportunities for}} low-permeability gas reservoirs to be exploited with large hydraulic fracturing campaigns. These so-called tight gas reservoirs have been subject of much research {{over the past three}} decades, primarily because it is difficult to optimize recovery. In this thesis, post-fracture production of tight gas reservoirs is simulated and interpreted through well test analyses. The focus lies on the impact of unconventional reservoir behaviour, specifically the impact of leakoff water on gas production and assessing the accuracy of post-fracture evaluation using production data and well tests. Specific characteristics of tight gas reservoirs, such as high capillary pressure, a ‘permeability jail’, and reservoir heterogeneity, may invoke phase trapping mechanisms that could potentially harm gas production. The ‘permeability jail’ is a hypothesis that gas-water relative permeability functions include a large saturation range with little or no fluid mobility, caused by the complex pore-structure of tight gas sandstone reservoirs. This thesis presents reservoir simulations of both the short and the long-term gas and water production, performed with a commercial numerical simulator. Simulations show that high capillary pressures alone do not harm gas production significantly. Assuming a permeability jail in lower-permeability reservoir zones in a heterogeneous reservoir results in an extended cleanup period and a reduction in total recoverable gas. This result is comparable to the simulation of mechanical or chemical damage to the reservoir surrounding the fracture, or so-called fracture face damage. With mechanical or chemical damage, the water production is impaired initially and slowly recovers with time. This distinguishes this type of damage from a permeability jail, which shows rapid water <b>flow-back</b> of approximately 50 % of the leakoff water. Finally, the impact of leakoff water on a permeability jail is severe. Therefore, it is advisable to control leakoff during the treatment. The simulation output data is analyzed with a commercial pressure transient analysis software package. The well test analyses show that a heterogeneous reservoir with permeability jail damage can also be interpreted as a homogeneous reservoir with either a very short or low-conductivity fracture: all three hypotheses fit the well-test data. This confirms that well tests may be inconclusive for distinguishing among these cases. Subsequent performed simulations show that reduction in fracture length does not extend the initial cleanup period, but strongly correlates with a shift of the production decline curve to lower gas rates. A reduced fracture length and damage from leakoff and a permeability jail are therefore distinguishable. On the other hand, it’s difficult to separate production results for a model with a low-conductivity fracture from a model with permeability jail damage: both show strongly reduced initial gas rates and followed by long cleanup periods. Water production can be used to discriminate between a fracture with reduced permeability and reservoir damage, however. This allows for a correct diagnosis and appropriate actions to be taken to optimize subsequent fracture treatments. Petroleum EngineeringGeotechnologyCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|Hydraulic {{stimulation}} {{techniques have}} been employed successfully {{over the past}} 60 years to enhance the productivity {{of oil and gas}} reservoirs. These techniques work by injecting a pressurised fluid into the wellbore to initiate and propagate an artificial fracture or to open a network of existing fractures. These techniques are also commonly known as hydraulic fracturing or fracking. The main objective of hydraulic stimulation is to create highly conductive pathways, which can significantly increase the permeability of the reservoir and, subsequently, improve the well productivity. An injection of small particles (usually known as propping agents or proppants) with the fracturing fluid is the most common method to prevent the stimulated fractures from full closure during the production stage because of confining stresses. To date, research has largely focused on the assessment of conditions and characteristics of fluid-driven fractures, as well as proppant transport and settlement mechanisms. The modern theory of hydraulic fractures is based on linear elastic fracture mechanics and theories of poro-elasticity, fluid flow in narrow openings and suspension flow in porous media. Despite numerous studies being carried out, few are devoted to the residual opening of hydraulic fractures, which has a significant effect on well productivity. There are many exciting potential applications and developments of hydraulic stimulation techniques for geothermal reservoirs and coal seam gas production. These all require new and more comprehensive theories, supported by analytical and numerical solutions capable of describing the non-linear effects of proppant placement and compressibility on the fracture residual opening profile and, ultimately, on the reservoir permeability and well performance. In order to address these needs and gaps, this thesis aims to develop: • a new mechanical model for predicting the mechanical response of saturated and unsaturated low-consolidated granular particles to compressive loading; • a new mathematical method and non-linear solutions for evaluating the residual aperture of fractures partially filled with unconsolidated compressible particles (proppant) and subjected to compressive loading; • a new mathematical model for evaluating the production rate of hydraulically stimulated wells taking into account the residual closure and various regions of distinct permeability along the fracture. These new models are all based on the classical theories of solid, fluid, contact, fracture, rock and soil mechanics, which provide a framework for evaluating the residual opening profiles (aperture) of hydraulically stimulated fractures, as well as the influence of the fracture residual aperture on the well performance. A number of simplifications are used to formulate the mathematical models and develop non-linear solutions. Many of these simplifications, such as two-dimensional problem geometry, plane strain conditions and linear elastic behaviour of the medium, represent a well-established foundation for analytical and numerical modelling in reservoir engineering. Accounting for other important phenomena, such as proppant <b>flow-back</b> and secondary cracking, {{is beyond the scope of}} this thesis but may be included in future work. The numerical results obtained within the developed models indicate that the residual openings and distribution of proppant along the fracture have a significant effect on well productivity (up to 50 per cent in the case of a relatively low level of confining stresses in the reservoir) and must be incorporated into the evaluation of the efficiency of hydraulic stimulation techniques and assessment of well productivity.
