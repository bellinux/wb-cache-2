500|$|Jones, {{who played}} Les, {{revealed}} that the runaway storyline was tough on him and he began crying when he read the script. He continued [...] "The <b>four</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> in the Battersby family read our scripts together to work out how {{we are going to}} play our parts. On this occasion, all <b>four</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> were sobbing. It is not like a normal Coronation Street story, it's more like a Taggart or a Cracker." [...] Jones thought the [...] "scrapes" [...] that Toyah found herself in were frightening and hoped that if the storyline could stop one teenager from running away from home, then it would be worthwhile. The storyline attracted the attention of the Independent Television Commission, who believed that the episode featuring Toyah's abduction should have carried a warning before it was broadcast.|$|E

In the old days we'd have the biggest hotel suites, the whole floor of the hotel, and the <b>four</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> would end up in the bathroom, just to be with each other". He added, [...] "there were some really loving, caring moments between four people: a hotel room here and there – a really amazing closeness. Just four guys who loved each other. It was pretty sensational." ...|$|E

We tried to put guitar solos on, but we kept on running into this problem. It really sounded like an afterthought." [...] Hammett said that he was happy with the final product. Rock stated, [...] "We made a promise to ourselves that we'd only keep stuff that had integrity. We didn't want to make a theatrical statement by adding overdubs." ...|$|E

500|$|The story—part of the {{original}} Star Trek pitch by series creator Gene Roddenberry—was first assigned to Lee Erwin. Johnson took on the writing duties after Roddenberry disliked his work on another plot proposal. Johnson's first draft was titled [...] "Damsel With a Dulcimer", incorporating elements from his Twilight Zone episode [...] "The <b>Four</b> <b>of</b> <b>Us</b> Are Dying". Roddenberry, producer Robert H. Justman and story editor John D. F. Black all tweaked elements of the episode, including the title. [...] "The Man Trap" [...] was the sixth episode to be filmed, but {{the first to be}} shot to schedule. Prop creator Wah Chang and costume designer William Ware Theiss created the creature.|$|E
500|$|On October 18, 2000, de la Rocha {{released}} a statement announcing his departure from the band. He said, [...] "I {{feel that it is}} now necessary to leave Rage because our decision-making process has completely failed. It is no longer meeting the aspirations of all <b>four</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> collectively as a band, and from my perspective, has undermined our artistic and political ideal." [...] "There was so much squabbling over everything", explained Morello, [...] "and I mean everything. We would even have fist fights over whether our T-shirts should be mauve or camouflaged! It was ridiculous. We were patently political, internally combustible. It was ugly for a long time".|$|E
500|$|Women's {{suffrage}} was {{an early}} interest of Douglas, and although she tended {{to shy away from}} polemics in her early work at The Miami Herald, on her third day as a society columnist, she chose suffrage and began to focus on writing about women in leadership positions. In 1917, she traveled with Mary Baird Bryan, William Jennings Bryan's wife, and two other women to Tallahassee to speak in support of women's right to vote. Douglas was not impressed with the reception the group got from the Florida Legislature. She wrote about her experience later: [...] "All <b>four</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> spoke to a joint committee wearing our best hats. Talking to them was like talking to graven images. They never paid attention to us at all." [...] Douglas was able to vote for the first time after she returned from Europe in 1920.|$|E

500|$|Each of {{the band}} members were in other bands prior to Delorentos, {{sometimes}} playing together, in what Conlan once described as [...] "a weird web of bands through schools and colleges, until the <b>four</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> came together". McGuinness started playing with McCormick's school band around 1999, with Conlan joining the band soon after that. After this band failed, McCormick played with Yourell for a while, with McCormick and Conlan having played in a band together as well. Yourell then worked in France for a time but later returned to Ireland. Eventually the four grouped together to form Delorentos, whose name was taken from an older band in which {{a number of them}} featured. They were, by their own admission, [...] "shite" [...] until they went to Chicago to play [...] "a rake of gigs". McCormick and Conlan were in college in the earlier days {{of the band}}'s career.|$|E
500|$|It was Johnson who {{suggested}} the creature {{should be a}} shapeshifter, having used the idea in an episode of The Twilight Zone he wrote called [...] "The <b>Four</b> <b>of</b> <b>Us</b> Are Dying". The creature was designed by Wah Chang, and dancer Sandra Gimpel wore the costume on-screen. She had previously appeared as a Talosian in [...] "The Cage". The head of the creature costume was sculpted in clay then covered in a plaster cast. Once the cast was removed, liquid latex was applied to create a flexible single-piece mask, which was then painted. Chang added a white wig and attached glass lenses to the mask for eyes. Once Gimpel was wearing the mask, cuts were made into its wrinkles to offer the actress some limited vision while wearing it. Gloves were modified by Chang to give the fingers the appearance of tentacles with suction cups. William Ware Theiss created {{the rest of the}} costume out of a fur bodysuit.|$|E
500|$|The Slip {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics, {{with an average}} rating of 78/100 based on eleven reviews on Metacritic. IGN gave the album an 8.8 out of 10, stating [...] "Simply put, The Slip is an amazing record." [...] The Toronto Star said [...] " [...] is hardly a throwaway, this seems a sincere gift to fans." [...] Eric Harvey of Pitchfork gave the album a 7.5 out of 10 and wrote [...] "Reznor's unique capacity to commingle raging industrial bangers with ballads and ambient instrumental passages appears in its best form since The Downward Spiral, and here gains much of the focus and restraint that many remember used to be his calling card." [...] Daphne Carr of LA Weekly said, [...] "Musically, it's his most adventurous work since The Fragile, and his business model is inspired—if unsustainable." [...] Mikael Wood of Spin complained that [...] "a few tracks, such as 'The <b>Four</b> <b>of</b> <b>Us</b> Are Dying,' go on for far too long", but then said [...] "Reznor recovers with a barn burner like 'Demon Seed'".|$|E

500|$|Shearer {{said in an}} {{interview}} that [...] "The animating impulse was to do rock 'n' roll right. The <b>four</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> had been around rock 'n' roll and we were just amazed by how relentlessly the movies got it wrong. Because we were funny people it was going to be a funny film, but we wanted to get it right." [...] When they tried to sell it to various Hollywood studios, they were told that the film would not work. The group kept saying, [...] "No, this is a story that's pretty familiar to people. We're not introducing them to anything they don't really know," [...] so Shearer thought it would at least have some resonance with the public. The film was only a modest success upon its initial release but found greater success, and a cult following, after its video release. In 2000, the film was ranked 29th on the American Film Institute's list of the top 100 comedy movies in American cinema and it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being [...] "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".|$|E
500|$|... "Four Rusted Horses" [...] is a blues-inspired rock song, and was {{compared}} {{to the work of}} The Doors and Johnny Cash. Manson described its lyric as being [...] "almost a nursery rhyme. [...] everyone thinks that I was singing about the apocalypse, but it's more just about the <b>four</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> my band, that managed to survive through all of this, and {{where do we go from}} here." [...] "Arma-goddamn-motherfuckin-geddon" [...] is an uptempo rock song which was described by The Quietus as [...] "classic Manson". Caren Gibson of Metal Hammer claimed that the song was reminiscent of [...] "Chain Reaction" [...] by Diana Ross, as well as the work of Depeche Mode. [...] "Blank and White" [...] deals with censorship, specifically the reaction to Time magazine's cover story [...] "Is God Dead?", which saw protesters brandishing blank picket signs. The lyric [...] "God is dead but god is still white / So shoot up the mall, the school or the president of whatever / Or whoever wants a fight" [...] was censored by Interscope on all editions of the album. Manson has said that this made him happy artistically, as [...] "the song is about censorship, and they censored [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{scene in}} which Susan, Lynette, and Gabrielle comfort Bree at the {{hospital}} was the last scene of the season involving the four principal characters. Teri Hatcher commented: [...] "It was a heavy scene. There was a very genuine and deeply felt recognition that all <b>four</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> {{together as a team}} appreciated the ride we'd had this season and were grateful that we'd survived it together." [...] An extension of the scene, in which the women discuss Susan's discovery of Martha Huber's journal, was cut for time, though it was aired on Good Morning America on May 23, 2005, one day after the episode's broadcast, and was included on the first season DVD set. The death of one housewife's husband was confirmed prior to the episode's broadcast. Steven Culp was not surprised when his character was killed off, stating [...] "I had a sneaking suspicion someone was going to go." [...] Producer and writer Kevin Murphy explained the reasoning for killing off the Rex character: [...] "As we neared the end of season 1, our plan was that each woman would enter a new life chapter. Gabrielle would learn to function without Carlos, Susan and Mike would build their relationship, Lynette would go back to work, and Bree would become a single woman. We either had to have Rex divorce her or die." [...] Cherry named the {{scene in which}} Bree finishes her spring cleaning before mourning the death of her husband as one of his top three favorites of the season, stating: [...] "It was one of the favorite things I wrote because it was so true to her character. She had to finish the cleaning she started, and she comes in and everything’s perfect." [...] A scene between Gabrielle and John was also cut for time.|$|E
