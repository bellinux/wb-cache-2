50|$|All of {{the funds}} in the account are exempt from income tax and capital gains tax, {{including}} at maturity. However, the 10% dividend tax payable on <b>franked</b> <b>income</b> (UK share dividends) cannot be reclaimed. The UK government has stated that at age 18 {{it will be possible}} to transfer the entire CTF into an ISA to keep the tax-free status of the investment. If the CTF is withdrawn as cash, the tax benefits will be permanently lost.|$|E

50|$|Test Claimants in the <b>Franked</b> Investment <b>Income</b> Group Litigation v IRC 2012 UKSC 19 is an English unjust {{enrichment}} law case, concerning liability for overpaid tax, and limitation of claims. The Supreme Court made {{a reference to}} the European Court of Justice (ECJ).|$|R
50|$|Shareholders who are {{residents}} of Australia for tax purposes include in their assessable income the grossed-up dividend amount (being {{the total of}} the dividend payable plus the associated <b>franking</b> credits). The <b>income</b> tax payable by the shareholders is calculated, and the franking credits are applied to offset the tax payable. In Australia and New Zealand {{the end result is}} the elimination of double taxation of company profits.|$|R
50|$|An {{eligible}} shareholder {{receiving a}} franked dividend declares the cash amount plus the <b>franking</b> credit as <b>income,</b> and {{is credited with}} the franking credit against their final tax bill. The effect {{is as if the}} tax office reversed the company tax by giving back the $0.30 to the shareholder and had them treat the original $1.00 of profit as income, in the shareholder's hands, like the company was merely a conduit.|$|R
60|$|It {{was also}} made plain to Frank that Lena's filial duties and scruples need no longer {{stand in the}} way of the marriage. Mrs. Fanshaw had two girls almost come out, and perhaps she did not wish them to be overshadowed by the aunt, who, however retiring, could not help being much more beautiful. So all that {{remained}} was that Mrs. Poynsett should be willing to supplement <b>Frank's</b> official <b>income</b> with his future portion. She was all the more rejoiced, as this visit showed her for the first time what Lena really was when brought into the sunshine without dread of what she might hear or see, or of harm being done by her belongings; and her gratitude for the welcome with which she was received was most touching.|$|R
50|$|McCourt related {{that when}} he was 11, his father left Limerick to find work in the {{factories}} of wartime Coventry, England, rarely sending back money to support his family. Eventually McCourt recounts that Malachy Senior abandoned Frank's mother altogether, leaving her to raise her four surviving children, on the edge of starvation, without any source of <b>income.</b> <b>Frank's</b> school education ended at age 13, when the Irish Christian Brothers rejected him. Frank then held odd jobs and stole bread and milk in an effort to provide for his mother and three surviving brothers.|$|R
40|$|Empirical {{evidence}} {{contradicts the}} view that savings rates are independent of permanent income levels. Instead, a distinctive nonlinear relationship between savings and permanent income has been found. What explains this result? Using Robert Frank's model of the demand for nonpositional goods, this note explores the impact that treating savings as a nonpositional good has {{on the relationship between}} savings and permanent <b>income.</b> <b>Frank's</b> model is extended and predictions are generated for various income distributions and utility function parameters. The similarity of the predictions to existing evidence increases as more weight is given to current consumption rank. ...|$|R
50|$|Nat is a bald-headed African-American {{stevedore}} {{who is a}} union {{president and}} is dubious of Frank Sobotka's political maneuvering. Nat is a firm believer that the unions should focus on repairing the disused grain pier before it is bought by property developers. He opposes Frank's efforts to have the canal dredged as he believes {{that this is a}} goal beyond their reach. Nat is concerned about <b>Frank's</b> surge in <b>income</b> and spending on campaign contributions and hiring a lobbyist. He questions Frank about the source of the funds and when Frank refuses to answer Nat cautions him about the risks of showing so much money.|$|R
50|$|Although {{they owned}} their own home, Frank McKetta {{and his family}} {{struggled}} during the Great Depression, when tragedy struck in 1936 {{with the death of}} Frank's father in a mining accident. His mother was left alone to raise the family during this economic struggle. The family survived {{with the help of a}} cow that was kept in a shed along with a pig and some chickens. They all helped keeping up a garden and during Frank's younger years, they had no outside form of <b>income.</b> <b>Frank</b> McKetta was lucky to be a part of a family in which all of the children received high school education at this time in history. He attended South Huntingdon High School which is now known as Yough High School. After high school only one of his sisters went to college. Frank McKetta chose to work along with family members at the McKetta Coal Company until he saved enough money to enter into the police academy. After saving enough money, he entered the Police Academy in Hershey, Pennsylvania on September 1, 1937. His career as a trooper started when he was first assigned in Luzerne County, where he was able to see first-hand the signs of corruption in the law enforcement. He later attended Indiana University, in Bloomington, Indiana, to take a summer course in 1963 on Advanced Police Management.|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{investigate}} whether two clear and simple indicators, dividends and franking credits, provide users with useful information to assess earnings persistence. Persistence {{is an important}} attribute of earnings (Dechow and Schrand 2004). I argue and show earnings persistence {{is a function of}} firm life-cycle. Firms can generally be divided into three life stages: establishing profitability, sustainable profitability and declining profitability. Using a simple one-period persistence model I demonstrate that dividends and higher franking credits identify firms in the different stages of the life-cycle. Dividends provide an inherent signal of firms that are in the mature phase of the life-cycle, and hence provide information about earnings persistence. I show firms that pay dividends have persistent profits and losses that reverse. However dividend paying firms are not homogenous. Firms that pay franked dividends have significantly more persistent earnings than firms that pay unfranked dividends. Consistent with higher franking credits identifying more mature firms, fully franked dividend paying firms have significantly less persistent losses than partially franked dividend paying firms. Importantly, my primary results provide an alternative explanation to Hanlon (2005) and add {{to our understanding of the}} accrual anomaly. Both Hanlon and my study investigate the informativeness of tax on earnings persistence. I demonstrate that firms that have large differences between the level of <b>franking</b> and accounting <b>income</b> (i. e., pay unfranked dividends while reporting a profit) have large book-tax differences. Such differences in tax and accounting income are a function of the firm life-cycle. Large book-tax differences are not necessarily the result of opportunism (or earnings management). Thus firms with large book-tax differences are typically establishing profitability or entering the declining phase. These firms have less persistence profits, accruals and cash flows than firms with small book-tax differences. I conclude the accrual anomaly is a function of inherent firm characteristics associated with different phases of the life-cycle rather than being a function of earnings management...|$|R
