40|$|AbstractMeasuring the {{clamping}} forces on cylindrical workpieces {{is a key}} factor in the geometrical tolerances of such components, especially if they are slender as the case of thin rings. The lower the clamping force, better tolerances will be achieved, but with the disadvantage of reducing friction and, therefore, increasing the risk of slipping. Therefore, achieving a minimum but safe clamping force is a key factor to control the process. Usually, these parts are made in lathes that have concentric plate clutches and these are fixed mechanically by wrenches or hydraulically through the control of pressure by valves. A simple and economic method is proposed to measure the {{clamping forces}} in lathes, although it is necessary the use of a model for the ring deformation. This method allows knowing the clamping force from the torque applied by a <b>dynamometric</b> <b>wrench,</b> or from the hydraulic pressure controlled by valves...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionSince {{the recent}} {{descriptions}} of the anterolateral ligament (ALL), {{the role played by}} the anterolateral peripheral structures in the rotational control of the knee is again being debated. The objective {{of this study was to}} identify the structures during internal tibial rotation and then to define their anatomical characteristics. We hypothesized that internal rotation would tighten several anatomical formations, both superficial and deep, with the ALL one part of these structures. Material and methodsNine fresh-frozen cadaver knee specimens were studied. The anterolateral structures tightened were identified from superficial to deep at 30 ° of flexion. Each was selectively dissected, identifying its insertions and orientations, and measuring its size. The length variations of the ALL during internal tibial rotation were measured by applying a 30 -N force using a <b>dynamometric</b> torque <b>wrench</b> at the tibiofibular mortise. ResultsThe superficial structures tightened were the iliotibial tract and the Kaplan fibers. In internal tibial rotation, the Kaplan fibers held the iliotibial tract against the lateral epicondyle, allowing it to play the role of a stabilizing ligament. The Kaplan fibers were 73. 11 ± 19. 09 mm long (range, 63 – 82 mm) and at their femoral insertion they were 12. 1 ± 1. 61 mm wide (range, 10 – 15 mm). The deep structures tightened covered a triangular area including the ALL and the anterolateral capsule. The ALL was 39. 11 ± 3. 4 mm long (range, 35 – 46 mm) in neutral rotation and 49. 88 ± 5. 3 mm long (range, 42 – 58 mm) in internal rotation (p< 0. 005). Its femoral insertion area was narrow at 5. 27 ± 1. 06 mm (range, 3. 5 – 7 mm) and was mainly proximal and posterior at the lateral epicondyle. Its tibial insertion zone was wide, with a clearly differentiated anterior limit but a posterior limit confused with the joint capsule. In the vertical plane, this insertion was located 6. 44 ± 2. 37 mm (range, 2 – 9) below the joint space. DiscussionThis study demonstrates two distinct anterolateral tissue planes tightened during internal rotation of the tibia: a superficial plane represented by the iliotibial tract and the Kaplan fibers, which acts as a ligament structure, and a deep plane represented by a triangular capsular ligament complex within which the ALL and the anterolateral capsule are recruited.
