Although {{the count}} {{and quality of}} sperm may be sufficiently high after vasectomy reversal surgery, female fertility factors may play an indirect role in pregnancy success. If the female partner’s age is >35 years old, the couple should consider a female <b>factor</b> <b>evaluation</b> {{to determine if they}} have adequate reproductive potential before a vasectomy reversal is undertaken. This evaluation can be done by a gynecologist and should include a cycle day 3 FSH and estradiol levels, an assessment of menstrual cycle regularity, and a hysterosalpingogram to evaluate for fibroids.|$|E
40|$|Safe {{operation}} {{is a central}} objective for nuclear power plants that must be supported by the entity managing the operation, the control room system. Safe {{operation is}} dependent on how technology is used, so {{it is important to}} take human factors issues into consideration. During design or modification of the control room system, its ability to support safe operation must be assessed to ensure that safety-critical discrepancies are eliminated before implementation. Methods are a necessary tool in human <b>factors</b> <b>evaluation,</b> and there are many to choose from. One prerequisite for evaluation is knowing what to evaluate, and this knowledge determines which methods are most suitable. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to identify categories of measures that can guide the choice of evaluation methods for assessing nuclear power plant control room systems. Measures targeted by human <b>factors</b> <b>evaluation</b> methods were compared with aspects that contribute to safe operation and measures proposed and used by other researchers. The conclusion of this paper is that measures targeted by human <b>factors</b> <b>evaluation</b> methods can be grouped into six categories: system performance, task performance, teamwork, use of resources, user experience, and identification of design discrepancies. These six categories can guide the choice of human <b>factors</b> <b>evaluation</b> methods to assess socio-technical systems. Methods providing data from all six categories of measures are needed to fully assess a nuclear power plant control room system...|$|R

50|$|The {{evaluation}} for VBI {{starts with}} a history and physical exam, with great emphasis on the cardiovascular and neurologic exam. It also includes a work-up to exclude benign conditions (such as labyrinthitis, vestibular neuronitis, and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo) that have overlapping signs and symptoms. However, the exact work-up largely depends on the patient’s age and known risk factors. For middle-aged patients, a cardiovascular risk <b>factor</b> <b>evaluation</b> is important. This often includes a cholesterol level, lipid profile (see this http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=183 to determine what your cholesterol level means), ECG, and echocardiogram. If a person with VBI is under age 45 and has no evidence for atherosclerosis, a work-up for hypercoagulable states (Lupus anticoagulant, anti-cardiolipin antibodies, is indicated. Screening for protein C, protein S, or antithrombin III deficiency is sometimes recommended but these are more usually responsible for venous thrombosis than arterial problems.|$|E

Methods: In this study, designed to investigate recycling and managing dry residues in District 1, threat factors were studied and internal <b>factors</b> <b>evaluation</b> (IFE) and external <b>factors</b> <b>evaluation</b> (EFE) matrixes were scored. Tehran Municipality District 1 has 10 subdistricts and 26 neighborhoods. The dry residues from Municipality District 1 that currently weigh approximately 2678 tons per day.
