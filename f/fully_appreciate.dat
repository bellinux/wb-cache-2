25|$|In her {{examination}} of myth, she appears {{as one who}} does not accept any special privileges for women. Ironically, feminist philosophers have had to extract de Beauvoir herself {{from out of the}} shadow of Jean-Paul Sartre to <b>fully</b> <b>appreciate</b> her. While more philosopher and novelist than activist, she did sign one of the Mouvement de Libération des Femmes manifestos.|$|E
25|$|Problems with Senge's vision {{include a}} failure to <b>fully</b> <b>appreciate</b> and {{incorporate}} the imperatives that animate modern organizations; the relative sophistication of the thinking he requires of managers (and whether many in practice are up to it); and questions regarding his treatment of organizational politics. It is certainly difficult to find real-life examples of learning organizations (Kerka 1995). There {{has also been a}} lack of critical analysis of the theoretical framework.|$|E

Conflicts arise when establishments such as restaurants, airlines, or fitness centers fail to accommodate deaf people by turning on Closed Captioning. Movie theaters are increasingly compliant with providing visual access to first-run movies through stand-alone devices, glasses and open caption technology which allow deaf people to attend movies as they are released.|$|E
25|$|Although Dirac did not {{at first}} <b>fully</b> <b>appreciate</b> the {{importance}} of his results, the entailed explanation of spin {{as a consequence of}} the union of quantum mechanics and relativity—and the eventual discovery of the positron—represents one of the great triumphs of theoretical physics. This accomplishment has been described as fully on a par with the works of Newton, Maxwell, and Einstein before him. In the context of quantum field theory, the Dirac equation is reinterpreted to describe quantum fields corresponding to spin- particles.|$|E
25|$|However, Richard D. Gill {{has argued}} that Jaynes {{misunderstood}} Bell's analysis. Gill {{points out that in}} the same conference volume in which Jaynes argues against Bell, Jaynes confesses to being extremely impressed by a short proof by Steve Gull presented at the same conference, that the singlet correlations could not be reproduced by a computer simulation of a local hidden variables theory. According to Jaynes (writing nearly 30 years after Bell's landmark contributions), it would probably take us another 30 years to <b>fully</b> <b>appreciate</b> Gull's stunning result.|$|E

25|$|One Ranger, seventeen-year-old , {{who wanted}} to be in on the action, also died in the fighting. He was the son of camp cook, D. R. Smith and the {{youngest}} Ranger ever to die in the line of duty. Smith was apparently too inexperienced to <b>fully</b> <b>appreciate</b> McNelly's terse orders because he got too close to a wounded Mexican bandit; the bandit killed the boy before Smith even knew what was happening. Berry Smith was buried in the northwest corner of the Brownsville cemetery on June 16 with full military honors. The funeral was recorded as one of the finest the city had ever seen.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} stage, Utzon worked {{successfully}} {{with the rest}} of the design team and the client, but, as the project progressed, the Cahill government insisted on progressive revisions. They also did not <b>fully</b> <b>appreciate</b> the costs or work involved in design and construction. Tensions between the client and the design team grew further when an early start to construction was demanded despite an incomplete design. This resulted in a continuing series of delays and setbacks while various technical engineering issues were being refined. The building was unique, and the problems with the design issues and cost increases were exacerbated by commencement of work before the completion of the final plans.|$|E
25|$|There are {{problems}} that may hinder the development the modeling of reading behaviours. First, computer models in reading {{tend to make}} assumptions of direct links between lexical properties and saccade attributes (by putting a formula linking the two into the model). These links are descriptive generalizations of existing empirical data and normally do not survive new data. In search for new data to support their models, researcher might have to keep adding and adjusting lexical process assumptions {{and are likely to}} ignore possible parsimonious process that underlies these assumptions. Caution should be taken when adding assumptions of how lexical processes affect saccade programming because reading is not what humans are evolved to do. The modeling of eye-movements in reading should treat reading as special case of visual perception and take into account more basic oculomotor properties(e.g., split fovea, depth perception) before making assumptions about the link between lexical processes and eye movements. Another problem is {{that there has been a}} lack of comparison between models on the same data set. Researcher teams tend to focus on the development of their own model and might not be able to <b>fully</b> <b>appreciate</b> the merits of other models due to the technical difficulties in sharing programs. In the future we might see unifying model that both explains complex reading behaviors well and is parsimonious enough to be generalizable to other eye-tracking fields such as visual search, scene viewing.|$|E

500|$|A Dramatic Turn of Events has {{received}} mixed reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album holds an average score of 55, based on six reviews. Rich Wilson called it [...] "fresh and frankly stunning"; however, {{he warned that}} the album was not immediately gratifying and that it required several listens to <b>fully</b> <b>appreciate.</b> Critics were generally complimentary of Mike Mangini's performance, with Drumhead elaborating, [...] " [...] demonstrates the physical prowess and agility of a racehorse, stretching {{to play at the}} top of his talents and reining himself in to allow his bandmates to do the same." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics {{praised the}} lock-on {{technology}} the game offered. Lucas Thomas of IGN {{said it was}} [...] "a great game on its own", but the lock-on feature completely revamped the overall experience. Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer preferred Sonic & Knuckles to Sonic 3, stating {{that he could not}} <b>fully</b> <b>appreciate</b> its predecessor without its [...] "companion piece". Sega Powers review praised the game's harder difficulty in comparison to its predecessor and the new expansion of levels, admitting that the expansion {{would not have been possible}} had Sonic 3 been a single game. Sega Magazines review similarly praised the lock-on technology and the new innovation the unique cartridge offered, adding that Sonic & Knuckles hidden stages and bosses would strongly add to the replay value of the combined title.|$|E
500|$|Moser {{published}} Cortinarius Fr. und nahe verwandte Gattungen in Südamerika in 1975, {{which was}} coauthored by Egon Horak. The work, {{along with his}} earlier monograph on [...] "Phlegmacium", proved to be some of Moser's most important, serving to encourage others to engage with Cortinarius in a meaningful way. Cortinarius Fr. und nahe verwandte Gattungen in Südamerika was a study of Cortinarius, Dermocybe and Stephanopus, a new genus first described in that work, in South America, and was dedicated to Singer. The work contained descriptions of 276 new species. Alexander H. Smith stressed {{the significance of the}} work, saying [...] "Anyone who has not worked in the systematics of Cortinarius cannot <b>fully</b> <b>appreciate</b> the magnitude and importance of this work to the general subject of the distribution and speciation of the higher fungi." ...|$|E

500|$|The Beatles {{undertook}} {{the recording}} of Abbey Road {{with a sense of}} discipline and cooperation that had largely been absent while making the White Album and Let It Be. Having temporarily left the group in January 1969 {{partly as a result of}} McCartney's criticism of his musicianship, Harrison exhibited a greater level of assertiveness regarding his place in the band, particularly while they worked on his compositions [...] "Something" [...] and [...] "Here Comes the Sun". In addition, like Lennon and McCartney, Martin had come to <b>fully</b> <b>appreciate</b> Harrison as a songwriter, later saying: [...] "I first recognised that he really had a great talent when we did 'Here Comes the Sun.' But when he brought in 'Something,' it was something else... It was a tremendous work – and so simple." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Ginsburg did not author the {{majority}} opinion, she {{was credited with}} influencing her colleagues on the case Safford Unified School District v. Redding, [...] The Court ruled that a school went too far in ordering a 13-year-old female student to strip to her bra and underpants so that female officials could search for drugs. In an interview published prior to the Court's decision, Ginsburg shared her view that some of her colleagues did not <b>fully</b> <b>appreciate</b> {{the effect of a}} strip search on a 13-year-old girl. As she pointed out, [...] "They have never been a 13-year-old girl." [...] In an 8–1 decision, the Court agreed that the school's search went too far and violated the Fourth Amendment and allowed the student's lawsuit against the school to go forward. Only Ginsburg and Justice Stevens would have allowed the student to sue individual school officials as well.|$|E
500|$|Although Stanisław Lem {{worked with}} Tarkovsky and Friedrich Gorenstein in {{developing}} the screenplay, Lem maintained that he [...] "never really liked Tarkovsky's version" [...] of his novel. Tarkovsky wanted a film story {{based on the novel}} but artistically independent of its origin. However, Lem opposed any divergence of the screenplay from the novel. Lem went as {{far as to say that}} Tarkovsky made Crime and Punishment rather than Solaris, omitting epistemological and cognitive aspects of his book. Tarkovsky claimed that Lem did not <b>fully</b> <b>appreciate</b> cinema and that he expected the film to merely illustrate the novel without creating an original cinematic piece. Tarkovsky's film is about the inner lives of its scientists as human beings. Lem's novel is about the conflicts of man's condition in nature and the nature of man in the universe. [...] For Tarkovsky, Lem's exposition of that existential conflict was the starting point for describing the inner lives of the characters.|$|E

500|$|Palladio always {{designed}} his villas {{with reference}} to their setting. If on a hill, such as Villa Capra, facades were frequently designed to be of equal value so that occupants could have fine views in all directions. Also, in such cases, porticos were built on all sides so that occupants could <b>fully</b> <b>appreciate</b> the countryside while being protected from the sun, similar to many American-style porches of today. Palladio sometimes used a loggia {{as an alternative to}} the portico. This can most simply be described as a recessed portico, or an internal single storey room, with pierced walls that are open to the elements. [...] Occasionally a loggia would be placed at second floor level over the top of a loggia below, creating what was known as a double loggia. Loggias were sometimes given significance in a facade by being surmounted by a pediment. Villa Godi has as its focal point a loggia rather than a portico, plus loggias terminating each end of the main building.|$|E
500|$|A rivalry {{emerged in}} 1931 between the NAACP and the Communist Party, when the Communists responded quickly and {{effectively}} {{to support the}} Scottsboro Boys, nine African-American youth arrested in 1931 in Alabama for rape. Du Bois and the NAACP felt that the case would not be beneficial to their cause, so they chose to let the Communist Party organize the defense efforts. Du Bois {{was impressed with the}} vast amount of publicity and funds the Communists devoted to the partially successful defense effort, and he came to suspect that the Communists were attempting to present their party to African Americans as a better solution than the NAACP. Responding to criticisms of the NAACP from the Communist Party, Du Bois wrote articles condemning the party, claiming that it unfairly attacked the NAACP, and that it failed to <b>fully</b> <b>appreciate</b> racism in the United States. The Communist leaders, in turn, accused Du Bois of being a [...] "class enemy", and claimed that the NAACP leadership was an isolated elite, disconnected from the working-class blacks they ostensibly fought for.|$|E

Daniel Baum of The Jerusalem Post called it [...] "one of the funniest, most entertaining and best-programmed computer games I have ever seen", and lauded its animation. He wrote that the game provided [...] "a more polished impression" [...] than either The Secret of Monkey Island or [...] The writer stated that its high system requirements were its only drawback, and believed that a Sound Blaster card was required to <b>fully</b> <b>appreciate</b> the game. In a retrospective review, Adventure Gamers' Chris Remo wrote, [...] "If someone were {{to ask for a}} few examples of games that exemplify the best of the graphic adventure genre, Day of the Tentacle would certainly be near the top".|$|E
