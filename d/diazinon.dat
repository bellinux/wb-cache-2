5|$|Pest {{control of}} the jack jumper ant is {{successful}} in maintaining their populations around suburban habitats. Chemicals like bendiocarb, chlorpyrifos, <b>diazinon</b> and permethrin are effective against them. Spraying of Solfac into nests is an effective way of controlling nests {{if they are in}} a close range of areas with considerable amounts of congestion and human activity. Pouring carbon disulfide into nest holes and covering entrances up with soil is another method of removing colonies. The Australian National Botanic Gardens has an effective strategy of marking and maintaining jack jumper nests.|$|E

Insecticides have also been successfully implemented, although commercial products are rarely targeted specifically towards earwigs. Multipurpose insecticides for control of earwigs, grasshoppers, sowbugs and other insects are more common. <b>Diazinon,</b> an organophosphate insecticide, has been known to continue killing F.auricularia up to 17 days after initial spraying [...]|$|E
2500|$|A {{special case}} of a {{chemical}} synapse is the neuromuscular junction, in which the axon of a motor neuron terminates on a muscle fiber. In such cases, the released neurotransmitter is acetylcholine, which binds to the acetylcholine receptor, an integral membrane protein in the membrane (the sarcolemma) of the muscle fiber. [...] However, the acetylcholine does not remain bound; rather, it dissociates and is hydrolyzed by the enzyme, acetylcholinesterase, located in the synapse. This enzyme quickly reduces the stimulus to the muscle, which allows the degree and timing of muscular contraction to be regulated delicately. Some poisons inactivate acetylcholinesterase to prevent this control, such as the nerve agents sarin and tabun, and the insecticides <b>diazinon</b> and malathion.|$|E
2500|$|Since this fly {{tends to}} lay its eggs in wool, {{a simple and}} {{effective}} {{way to reduce the}} incidence of infection is to shear ewes regularly. Enacting simple sanitary measures can also reduce blow fly strike. Timely and proper disposal of carcasses and proper removal of feces can aid in significantly reducing strike. Moving sheep from warm, humid, and sheltered areas to more open areas can also help to reduce blow fly strike, for this eliminates conditions conducive to fly development. Trapping systems such as sticky paper may also be used to control fly numbers. Treating a flock with chemical agents can be costly, but can aid greatly in maintaining the resistance of the flock to L. sericata. Plunge dipping in <b>diazinon</b> can directly kill the fly on contact. This method works from 3 to 8 weeks in controlling the fly. An alternate chemical method is a pyrethroid pour-on, which lasts 6 to 10 weeks {{depending on the type of}} pyrethroid used. Cryomazine and dicylanil, which are insect growth regulators, are also effective and last from 10 to 16 weeks. Although chemical treatment can be very effective, it is costly, tedious, and takes up valuable time.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Diazinon</b> was {{developed}} in 1952 by the Swiss company Ciba-Geigy to replace the insecticide DDT. <b>Diazinon</b> became available for mass use in 1955, as DDT production tapered. Before 1970 <b>diazinon</b> had issues with contaminants in the solution. but by the 1970s, alternative purification methods were used to reduce residual materials. After this, <b>diazinon</b> became an all-purpose indoor and outdoor commercial pest control product.

50|$|Other {{than for}} {{agricultural}} use, the organophosphate <b>diazinon</b> has been {{banned in the}} U.S. More than one million pounds of <b>diazinon</b> were used in California to control agricultural pests in 2000. The areas and crops on which <b>diazinon</b> are most heavily applied are structural pest control, almonds, head lettuce, leaf lettuce, and prunes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diazinon</b> is {{a contact}} {{insecticide}} which kills insects by altering normal neurotransmission within {{the nervous system}} of the insect. As mentioned above, <b>diazinon</b> inhibits the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which hydrolyzes the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) in cholinergic synapses and neuromuscular junctions. This results in abnormal accumulation of ACh within the nervous system. <b>Diazinon,</b> although a thiophosphoric ester, shares a common mechanism of toxicity with other organophosphate insecticides such as chlorpyrifos, malathion and parathion, and is not very effective against the organophosphate-resistant insect populations.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diazinon</b> (IUPAC name: O,O-Diethyl O-4-methyl-6-(propan-2-yl)pyrimidin-2-yl phosphorothioate, INN - Dimpylate), a colorless to {{dark brown}} liquid, is a thiophosphoric acid ester {{developed}} in 1952 by Ciba-Geigy, a Swiss chemical company (later Novartis and then Syngenta). It is a nonsystemic organophosphate insecticide formerly {{used to control}} cockroaches, silverfish, ants, and fleas in residential, non-food buildings. <b>Diazinon</b> was heavily used during the 1970s and early 1980s for general-purpose gardening use and indoor pest control. A bait form was used to control scavenger wasps in the western U.S. <b>Diazinon</b> is used in flea collars for domestic pets in Australia and New Zealand. Residential uses of <b>diazinon</b> were outlawed in the U.S. in 2004 {{but it is still}} approved for agricultural uses. An emergency antidote is atropine.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Diazinon</b> can be used, {{but often}} {{requires}} multiple applications.|$|E
5000|$|Intoxication of <b>diazinon</b> {{produces}} the following signs and symptoms: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Diazinon</b> {{functions}} as an acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor. This enzyme {{breaks down the}} neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) into choline and an acetate group. (1) The inhibition of the AChE causes an abnormal accumulation of ACh in the synaptic cleft.When <b>Diazinon</b> enters the body, it is oxidatively degenerated to diaxozon, an organophosphate compound that is much more poisoning than <b>diazinon</b> and causes mainly the inhibition of AChE (6). The activation of <b>diazinon</b> (Reaction 1) {{is located in the}} liver microsomal enzyme system and requires O2 and NADPH. Additionally it can also be degenerated via oxidation in the microsomal enzyme system (Reaction 2). Both reactions are possible, and likely are catalyzed nonspecifically by the same mixed function oxidase.Once formed diazoxon is biotransformed again as it is degenerated. Diazoxon is degenerated due to the very effective hydrolyases in the microsomal and other sub cellular factions within the liver (Reaction 3). Mammalian specie degenerate diazoxon at a much slower rate though (with a half-life of 2 to 6 weeks). Insects lack this hydrolysis step which allows for the toxic species to accumulate rapidly. The detoxification of diazoxon is processed through the mircosomal mixed function oxidase system. Although not fully known, it is believed that this is the cause for the selectivity of <b>diazinon</b> against insects. After the hydrolysis or oxidation <b>diazinon</b> is further degenerated (Reaction 4).|$|E

5000|$|The form of <b>diazinon</b> {{varies widely}} {{as it can}} be in dusts, granules, liquids, concentrates, microencapsulations, {{wettable}} powders, and seed dressings. Its appearance varies depending on purity, ranging from a dark brown (industrial grade), to a colorless liquid (pure). Indicative of its functionality of a thiophosphoric ester, the chemical has a pronounced smell similar to that of diethyl ether. [...] <b>Diazinon</b> is relatively stable under standard ambient temperature and pressure but is susceptible to form toxic phosphine gas upon heating. Furthermore, <b>diazinon</b> can oxidize into toxic phosphorus oxides if {{in the presence of a}} strong oxidizing agent.|$|E
5000|$|According to the German Patent bureau, the {{industrial}} synthesis of <b>diazinon</b> is as follows: ...|$|E
50|$|Because <b>diazinon</b> is fat soluble, {{there is}} {{potential}} for delayed toxicity if {{significant amounts of}} <b>diazinon</b> are stored in fatty tissues. Intermediate syndrome generally occurs within 24 - 96 hours after exposure. Intermediate syndrome in humans is characterized by difficulty breathing and muscular weakness, often in the face, neck and proximal limb muscles. Cranial nerve palsies and depressed tendon reflexes have also been reported.|$|E
5000|$|An effect {{caused by}} <b>diazinon</b> is a {{decrease}} in response to predator cues in Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). <b>Diazinon,</b> an organopesticide, was exposed to juvenile Chinook salmon for two hours at 1 and 10 μg/L, and these concentrations were enough to eliminate the behavioral responses of the fish to predator chemical cues. [...] If the fish cannot recognize that a predator is nearby, {{it is likely to}} be eaten. This is an example of a behavioral sublethal effect leading to ecological death.|$|E

50|$|One {{common cause}} of SLUDGE is {{exposure}} to organophosphorus insecticides (including parathion, malathion, and <b>diazinon)</b> or nerve gas, such as sarin. These agents phosphorylate acetylcholinesterase, thereby irreversibly deactivating acetylcholinesterase and raising acetylcholine levels and causing SLUDGE.

50|$|Twenty {{different}} pesticides {{were detected}} in on-site soil surface samples including <b>diazinon,</b> endosulfan and heptachlor epoxide, which {{were found at}} highest levels in the burn area, and disulfoton, endosulfan, merphos, and methamidophos which were found in high concentrations near the former warehouse and office. The concentrations of listed pesticides were all significantly above comparison values and therefore of concern for human and environmental health. On-site groundwater was reported to contain low levels of butyric acid, dinoseb, and endosulfan due to leaching. Only endosulfan concentrations were significantly above comparison values. On-site air analyses also found eight different pesticides at levels significantly above background levels. The eight pesticides were dacthal, diainon, endosulfan, malathion, mevinphos, maled, methyl parathion, and phorate. However, these concentrations were not enough in comparison to raise concern. Lastly, dead fish samples found in the pond contained dacthal (27.3 mg/kg), DDE (0.11 mg/kg), <b>diazinon</b> (0.1 mg/kg), and endosulfan (0.92 mg/kg).|$|E
