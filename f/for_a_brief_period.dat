5|$|Roman troops, however, {{penetrated}} {{far into}} the north of modern Scotland several more times. Indeed, {{there is a greater}} density of Roman marching camps in Scotland than anywhere else in Europe, as a result of at least four major attempts to subdue the area. The Antonine Wall was occupied again <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> <b>period</b> after 197. The most notable invasion was in 209 when the emperor Septimius Severus, claiming to be provoked by the belligerence of the Maeatae, campaigned against the Caledonian Confederacy.

5|$|Several {{types of}} cricket songs {{are in the}} {{repertoire}} of some species. The calling song attracts females and repels other males, and is fairly loud. The courting song is used when a female cricket is near and encourages her to mate with the caller. A triumphal song is produced <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> <b>period</b> after a successful mating, and may reinforce the mating bond to encourage the female to lay some eggs rather than find another male. An aggressive song is triggered by contact chemoreceptors on the antennae that detect the presence of another male cricket.|$|E
5|$|Succession: the Augustan History {{claims that}} Maeonius was proclaimed emperor <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> <b>period</b> before {{being killed by}} the soldiers.

Odaenathus was succeeded by his son, the ten-year-old Vaballathus under the regency of Zenobia. Hairan II probably died soon after his father, as only Vaballathus succeeded to the throne.|$|E

5|$|Critical {{reception}} to Knuckles' Chaotix, both {{contemporary and}} in retrospect, has been mixed. Critics found the partner mechanic and tethering physics to be cumbersome, although many journalists appreciated Sega's attempt to innovate the series. The level design was also cited as poor by multiple publications. The game {{has been considered}} the last classic game of the Sonic series and a declining point. Some characters and concepts introduced in Knuckles' Chaotix were later featured in other Sonic games and media. Despite interest from fans, the game itself has not been re-released except <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> <b>period</b> through GameTap in the 2000s.|$|E
5|$|Early on September 21, {{the motion}} {{shifted to the}} north as it moved along the {{northwest}} periphery of the subtropical ridge. That general motion continued throughout the day, however, Helene began to turn more northeastward that evening {{along the edge of}} the subtropical ridge, east of Bermuda. A decrease in wind shear and relatively warm water around 81°F (27°C) kept the intensity mostly stationary, keeping Helene as a Category1 hurricane. The intensity held around 80mph (130km/h) before strengthening slightly late on September 22, despite losing some tropical characteristics (it was operationally downgraded to a tropical storm <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>brief</b> <b>period)</b> as it accelerated northeast in the north Atlantic. A QuikSCAT analysis early on September 23 confirmed a high-end Category1 hurricane with 90mph (145km/h) winds.|$|E
