50|$|A single {{filing of}} a PCT {{application}} {{is made with}} a Receiving Office (RO) in one language. It then results in a search performed by an International Searching Authority (ISA), accompanied by a written opinion regarding the patentability of the invention, which {{is the subject of}} the application. It is optionally followed by a preliminary examination, performed by an International Preliminary Examining Authority (IPEA). Finally, the relevant national or regional authorities administer matters related to the <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> (if provided by national law) and issuance of patent.|$|E

40|$|Projects are {{increasingly}} cross-cultural and complex, both technically and relationally. The diversity of participants enhances differences in perceptions {{and understanding of}} meaning {{of the variety of}} signals (such as drawings and messages); often, the consequence is reduced performance and conflictual situations. Appreciation of such differences and of how people make sense of their worlds enables participants to appreciate the views of others and so, mitigate potential problems. Hence, a review of sensemaking literature is undertaken regarding individual and collective sensemaking, cultural schemas and the impact of cultural sensemaking on cross-culture international alliances, together with <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> to contexts of construction, such as project realisation process and construction innovation. Conclusions advocate practical changes to secure heedful sensemaking towards improving relationships on projects and both process and product performance...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results from}} an eight-day network packet trace of MosquitoNet. MosquitoNet allows users of laptop computers to switch seamlessly between a metropolitan-area wireless network and a wired network (10 Mbit/s Ethernet) available in offices and on-campus residences. Results include {{the amount of}} user mobility between the wired and wireless networks, the amount of mobility within the wireless network, an <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> end-to-end delays, and an examination of overall packet loss and reordering in the wireless network. We find that the average mobile host switches between the wired and wireless networks 14 times during the trace and moves within the wireless network five times. Round trip latencies in the wireless network are very high, {{with a minimum of}} 0. 2 seconds. Even higher end-to-end delays, of up to hundreds of seconds, are due to packet loss and reordering. These delays cause users to change their usage patterns when connected to the wireless network [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Haste (High-level Automated System Test Environment) {{represents}} {{an approach to}} system testing that is philosophically consistent with standard XP unit testing practices. Test code runs in the same address space as the application under test, allowing for ready <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> state. The fundamental Haste abstractions of Story, Step, and StoryBook provide a framework to implement system tests. Utility classes simplify test development. In addition to acting as XP acceptance tests, Haste tests aid source maintenance and extension, and {{can play an important}} role in a release process. This paper describes the elements of Haste, our experience with using it to test a complex Java Swing application, and the perspective of the client for whom the application was developed. Haste is available under an open source license. Keywords. System, acceptance, automation, GUI, testing, Haste. 1 System Testing System tests validate the soundness and behavior of the application from the user’s perspective [1]. In an XP project, system tests serve as acceptance tests. In this rol...|$|E

50|$|The UK Intellectual Property Office radically {{altered the}} way UK {{national}} trade mark applications were examined in October 2007.

No longer will the UKIPO unilaterally be able to prevent the grant of a UK national trade mark application on the basis of an earlier pending application or prior registration for a conflicting mark.
