5|$|From 1950 to 1952, {{there were}} a series of {{disputes}} between EES director Rosselot and <b>Georgia</b> <b>Tech</b> vice president Cherry Emerson over the station's finances and Rosselot's hand in founding Scientific Associates. When {{it was founded in}} October 1951, Rosselot was president and CEO of Scientific Associates; at issue was the potential conflict of interest with his role at <b>Georgia</b> <b>Tech,</b> and what, if any, role <b>Georgia</b> <b>Tech</b> should have in technology transfer to the marketplace. Emerson later instituted a policy requiring EES employees wishing to work with Scientific Associates to make a written request to the president of <b>Georgia</b> <b>Tech.</b> However, Rosselot's participation in Scientific Associates' founding and early operations ensured the eventual success of Scientific Atlanta and facilitated subsequent technology transfer by Georgia Tech's VentureLab and the Advanced Technology Development Center.|$|E
