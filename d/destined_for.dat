The scheme <b>destines</b> <b>for</b> numerical solving {{of problems with}} initial data on the characteristic surface and has the second order of summary approximation in grid norm on uniform grids. Energy change theorem for presented scheme is the algebraic corollary of its equations, as the difference analogues of electromagnetic energy and Joule heat losses are the positive defined quadratic forms of grid functions of unknowns. This theorem guarantees convergence of difference solution to exact solution with the second order in the energy norm. The convergence speed is checked by the comparison with analytical solutions.

5|$|Coal was {{transported by}} canal and a railway {{connection}} to the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway's Beswick branch built in the early 1900s, {{but most of it}} was used locally, transported by road using horse and carts and motor lorries, much of it <b>destined</b> <b>for</b> the adjacent Bradford Ironworks. The company bought a 0-4-0 saddle tank locomotive, Bradford, from the Avonside Engine Company of Bristol in 1928 to shunt wagons to the colliery siding.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s and 1930s {{the only}} fully trained crews were pilots, other crew members being volunteers from skilled ground trades who {{underwent}} short courses in gunnery and bomb aiming. Pilots {{were responsible for}} navigation, and when accurate navigation was essential, a second pilot was carried. Early in 1936 the Air Navigation School had been formed at RAF Manston to take over this training for all pilots <b>destined</b> <b>for</b> Coastal and Bomber Commands. Conversion training for Flying Boats was also given there.|$|E

5|$|Flight 712 {{took off}} from Heathrow at 15:27 GMT (16:27 BST), 12 minutes later than scheduled. It had 127 people aboard, {{including}} a crew augmented {{by the addition of}} an acting flight officer, John Hutchinson, and a check captain for routine performance review of the pilot in command, Captain Cliff Taylor.

5|$|Hannover {{was struck}} from the navy list in 1936 and <b>destined</b> <b>for</b> the scrapyard. There were ideas to rebuild {{her as a}} target ship {{especially}} for aircraft, although this never occurred. Schlesien was re-boilered and converted into a training ship as well in 1936. The following year, Schlesien toured South America, including a stop in Argentina in December. By 1939, both ships had been replaced in front-line service by newer ships, and were instead relegated to training duties.|$|E
5|$|However, {{evidence}} {{pointing out}} that the number of bezants on each shield was greater than five during long periods following Afonso I's reign, as well as the fact that only in the 15th century was this legend registered on a chronicle by Fernão Lopes (1419), support this explanation as one of pure myth and highly charged with patriotic feeling in the sense that Portugal was created by divine intervention and was <b>destined</b> <b>for</b> great things.|$|E
40|$|Through {{the use of}} a mutant {{deficient}} in ornithine-δ-transaminase (OTA), it is shown that this enzyme normally has no obligate or even major biosynthetic role in Neurospora. The pathways of ornithine and proline synthesis proceed wholly independently of each other in OTA-less strains. It is probable that OTA functions as an enzyme of arginine catabolism. With mutants affected in OTA, ornithine transcarbamylase, and the synthesis of ornithine, it was demonstrated that exogenous and endogenous ornithine are utilized in different ways. Exogenous ornithine is <b>destined</b> mainly <b>for</b> catabolism, whereas endogenous ornithine is <b>destined</b> mainly <b>for</b> biosynthesis. It is suggested that this distinction depends upon differences in the intracellular location or origin of the two sources of ornithine...|$|R

5|$|In 1926, {{when the}} U.S. Highway system was first announced, {{there was a}} gap in US-50 between Ely and Thistle. At the time the states of Utah and Nevada were feuding about which of the old auto trails would be paved and used for the new U.S. Highway System. Nevada favored the Lincoln Highway, which the modern US-50 closely follows in that state. Utah refused to {{consider}} the Lincoln Highway west of Salt Lake City. Officials perceived that route would carry all California bound traffic directly to Nevada while passing through very few communities in Utah. Utah instead favored the Victory Highway (modern Interstate 80 west of Salt Lake) and the Arrowhead Trail (modern Interstate 15). By favoring these routes Utah could force travelers <b>destined</b> <b>for</b> southern California to use a different route than those <b>destined</b> <b>for</b> northern California, with both of these traversing through more cities in Utah than the Lincoln Highway. The Arrowhead trail was especially beneficial to Utah as it passed through many communities in the state, but only Las Vegas in Nevada.|$|E
