5|$|Ryan White {{was born}} at St. Joseph Memorial Hospital in Kokomo, Indiana, to Hubert Wayne and Jeanne Elaine (Hale) White. When he was circumcised, the {{bleeding}} would not stop. When he was three days old, doctors diagnosed him with severe <b>hemophilia</b> <b>A,</b> a hereditary blood coagulation disorder associated with the X chromosome, which causes even minor injuries to result in severe bleeding. For treatment, he received weekly infusions of Factor VIII, a blood product created from pooled plasma of non-hemophiliacs, an increasingly common treatment for hemophiliacs at the time.|$|E
25|$|Type 3 is {{the most}} severe form of vWD (homozygous for the {{defective}} gene) and is characterized by complete absence of production of vWF. The von Willebrand factor is undetectable in the vWF antigen assay. Since the vWF protects coagulation factor VIII from proteolytic degradation, total absence of vWF leads to extremely low factor VIII level, equivalent to that seen in severe <b>hemophilia</b> <b>A</b> with its clinical manifestations of life-threatening external and internal hemorrhages. The inheritance pattern of vWD type 3 is autosomal recessive, while the inheritance pattern of <b>hemophilia</b> <b>A</b> is X-linked recessive.|$|E
25|$|Factor VIII {{turned out}} to be {{deficient}} in the clinically recognised but etiologically elusive hemophilia A; it was identified in the 1950s and is alternatively called antihemophilic globulin due to its capability to correct <b>hemophilia</b> <b>A.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Hemophilias</b> <b>A</b> and B are X chromosome-linked {{bleeding}} disorders, {{which are}} mainly treated by repeated infusions of factor (F) VIII or FIX, respectively. In the present review, we specify the limitations in expression of recombinant (r) FVIII and summarize the bioengineering {{strategies that are}} currently being explored for constructing novel rFVIII molecules characterized by high efficiency expression and improved functional properties. We present the strategy to prolong FVIII lifetime by disrupting FVIII interaction with its clearance receptors and demonstrate how construction of human-porcine FVIII hybrid molecules can reduce their reactivity towards inhibitory antibodies. While the progress in improving rFIX is impeded by low recovery rates, the authors are optimistic that the efforts of basic science may ultimately lead to higher efficiency of replacement therapy of both <b>hemophilias</b> <b>A</b> and B...|$|R

50|$|In 2002, Massie {{was named}} one of the 100 most {{influential}} people in the field of finance by CFO Magazine. In the same year, he learned that he had contracted Hepatitis C from contaminated blood medications used to treat his <b>hemophilia.</b> <b>As</b> a result he resigned from Ceres in order to pursue medical treatment and he received a liver transplant in 2009. During this period, he continued to serve on a number of boards, and was a Visiting Scholar at Harvard Law School.|$|R

25|$|During the 1980s, {{molecular}} {{and cellular}} studies distinguished <b>hemophilia</b> <b>A</b> and vWD more precisely. Persons who had vWD had a normal FVIII gene on the X chromosome, and some had an abnormal vWF gene on chromosome 12. Gene sequencing identified {{many of these}} persons as having a vWF gene mutation. The genetic causes of milder forms of low vWF are still under investigation, and these forms {{may not always be}} caused by an abnormal vWF gene.|$|E
25|$|If a {{coagulation}} factor {{is part of}} the contact activation or tissue factor pathway, a deficiency of that factor will affect only one of the tests: Thus <b>hemophilia</b> <b>A,</b> a deficiency of factor VIII, which {{is part of the}} contact activation pathway, results in an abnormally prolonged aPTT test but a normal PT test. The exceptions are prothrombin, fibrinogen, and some variants of FX that can be detected only by either aPTT or PT. If an abnormal PT or aPTT is present, additional testing will occur to determine which (if any) factor is present as aberrant concentrations.|$|E

5|$|Symptomatic {{carriers}} of the gene, while not hemophiliacs themselves, can have symptoms of <b>hemophilia</b> including <b>a</b> {{lower than normal}} blood clotting factor {{that can lead to}} heavy bleeding. DNA testing on the remains of the royal family proved conclusively in 2009 that Alexei suffered from <b>Hemophilia</b> B, <b>a</b> rarer form of the disease. His mother and one sister, identified alternatively as Maria or Anastasia, were carriers. Therefore, had Anastasia lived to have children of her own, they may have been afflicted by the disease as well. Alexei's hemophilia was chronic and incurable; his frequent attacks caused permanent disability.|$|R

25|$|In {{the case}} of {{families}} at risk for X-linked diseases, patients are provided with a single PGD assay of gender identification. Gender selection offers a solution to individuals with X-linked diseases {{who are in the}} process of getting pregnant. The selection of a female embryo offspring is used in order to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive diseases. Such X-linked Mendelian diseases include Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), and <b>hemophilia</b> <b>A</b> and B, which are rarely seen in females because the offspring is unlikely to inherit two copies of the recessive allele. Since two copies of the mutant X allele are required for the disease to be passed on to the female offspring, females will at worst be carriers for the disease but may not necessarily have a dominant gene for the disease. Males on the other hand only require one copy of the mutant X allele for the disease to occur in one's phenotype and therefore, the male offspring of a carrier mother has a 50% chance of having the disease. Reasons may include the rarity of the condition or because affected males are reproductively disadvantaged. Therefore, medical uses of PGD for selection of a female offspring to prevent the transmission of X-linked Mendelian recessive disorders are often applied. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis applied for gender selection can be used for non-Mendelian disorders that are significantly more prevalent in one sex. Three assessments are made prior to the initiation of the PGD process for the prevention of these inherited disorders. In order to validate the use of PGD, gender selection is based on the seriousness of the inherited condition, the risk ratio in either sex, or the options for disease treatment.|$|E
2500|$|The best-known {{coagulation}} factor disorders are the hemophilias. The three main forms are <b>hemophilia</b> <b>A</b> (factor VIII deficiency), hemophilia B (factor IX deficiency or [...] "Christmas disease") and hemophilia C (factor XI deficiency, mild bleeding tendency). <b>Hemophilia</b> <b>A</b> and B are X-linked recessive disorders, whereas Hemophilia C {{is a much}} more rare autosomal recessive [...] disorder most commonly seen in Ashkenazi Jews.|$|E

40|$|The {{function}} of tissue factor (Tf) -initiated coagulation is hemorrhage control through {{the formation and}} maintenance of an impermeable platelet-fibrin barrier. The catalytic processes involved in the clot maintenance function are not well defined, although the rebleeding problems characteristic of individuals with <b>hemophilias</b> <b>A</b> and B suggest a link between specific defects in the Tf-initiated process and defects in the maintenance function. We have previously demonstrated, using a methodology of “flow replacement” (or resupply) of ongoing Tf-initiated reactions with fresh reactants, that procoagulant complexes are produced during Tf-initiated coagulation, which are capable of reinitiating coagulation without input from extrinsic factor Xase activity (Orfeo, T., Butenas, S., Brummel-Ziedins, K. E., and Mann, K. G. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 42887 – 42896). Here we used Tf-initiated reactions in normal and hemophilia blood or in their corresponding proteome mixtures as sources of procoagulant end products and then varied the resupplying material to determine {{the identity of the}} catalysts that drive the new cycle of thrombin formation. The central findings are as follows: 1) the prothrombinase complex (fVa-fXa-Ca 2 +-membrane) accumulated during the episode of Tf-initiated coagulation is the primary catalyst responsible for the observed pattern of prothrombin activation after resupply; 2) impairments in intrinsic factor Xase function, i. e. <b>hemophilias</b> <b>A</b> and B, result in an impaired capacity to mount a resupply response; and 3) in normal hemostasis the intrinsic factor Xase function contributes to the durability of the resupply response...|$|R
5000|$|Massie {{was born}} on August 17, 1956, with severe classic <b>hemophilia.</b> <b>As</b> a result of this, his father, Robert Massie Sr., wrote Nicholas and Alexandra (1967), a {{biography}} of Tsar Nicholas II and his family, which was produced as the movie Nicholas and Alexandra four years later. Massie's parents also wrote a more personal account of their son's challenges, titled Journey (Knopf, 1975), of which Time Magazine wrote, [...] "Its portrait of Bobby Massie's enduring courage and the decency and devotion of those who helped him makes Journey a remarkable human document."

5000|$|<b>Hemophilia</b> is <b>a</b> genetic {{illness that}} causes {{dysfunction}} {{in one of}} the blood's clotting mechanisms. This can allow otherwise inconsequential wounds to be life-threatening, but more commonly results in hemarthrosis, or bleeding into joint spaces, which can be crippling.|$|R
2500|$|There {{are several}} named {{coagulation}} factors that interact {{in a complex}} way to form blood clots, as discussed in the article on coagulation. Deficiencies of coagulation factors are associated with clinical bleeding. [...] For instance, deficiency of Factor VIII causes classic <b>Hemophilia</b> <b>A</b> while deficiencies of Factor IX cause [...] "Christmas disease"(hemophilia B). Antibodies to Factor VIII can also inactivate the Factor VII and precipitate bleeding that {{is very difficult to}} control. [...] This is a rare condition that is most likely to occur in older patients and in those with autoimmune diseases. [...] von Willebrand disease is another common bleeding disorder. It is caused by a deficiency of or abnormal function of the [...] "von Willebrand" [...] factor, which is involved in platelet activation. Deficiencies in other factors, such as factor XIII or factor VII are occasionally seen, but may not be associated with severe bleeding and are not as commonly diagnosed.|$|E
2500|$|X-linked {{recessive}} {{conditions are}} also caused by mutations in genes on the X chromosome. Males are more frequently affected than females, {{and the chance}} of passing on the disorder differs between men and women. The sons {{of a man with}} an X-linked recessive disorder will not be affected, and his daughters will carry one copy of the mutated gene. [...] A woman who is a carrier of an X-linked recessive disorder (XRXr) has a 50% chance of having sons who are affected and a 50% chance of having daughters who carry one copy of the mutated gene and are therefore carriers. [...] X-linked recessive conditions include the serious diseases <b>hemophilia</b> <b>A,</b> Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, as well as common and less serious conditions such as male pattern baldness and red-green color blindness. [...] X-linked recessive conditions can sometimes manifest in females due to skewed X-inactivation or monosomy X (Turner syndrome).|$|E
2500|$|The {{discovery}} of the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system has revolutionized genetic research. In terms of human health, it has applications to both specific diseases as well as stem cell systems that model these same diseases. In stem cell research, the CRISPR system has been successfully applied to {{a wide spectrum of}} diseases. Mutations in transcriptional repressor CTCF from cultured intestinal stem cells of cystic fibrosis patients were corrected using CRISPR/Cas. Subsequent applications built upon simple sequence corrections and successfully repaired a chromosomal inversion abnormality in <b>Hemophilia</b> <b>A.</b> Both applications demonstrate the utility of pairing CRISPR/Cas with stem cell models in the study and treatment of genetic disease. With the advent of patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), the applicability of CRISPR/Cas is further strengthened. To date, CRISPR methods have successfully repaired disease-associated genetic mutations in 1) metabolic disorders such as β-thalassemia, 2) immunological deficiencies such as severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) [...] and 3) neuromuscular diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The corrections of these genetic mutations, more importantly, are potential future vehicles for cell and gene therapies where the patient’s own repaired stem cells can be re-implanted. The no-SCAR method, as an improvement of the CRISPR/Cas system, will {{play an important role in}} modeling human disease using iPS cells and in the future treating these same diseases.|$|E

50|$|Almost {{one year}} after her {{marriage}} to the tsar, Alexandra {{gave birth to the}} couple's first child: a girl named Olga, who was born on 15 November 1895. Olga could not be the heir presumptive due to the Pauline Laws implemented by tsar Paul I: priority in the order of succession to the Russian throne belonged to male members of the Romanov dynasty, however distantly related to the Tsar, so long as any remained alive. Olga was well loved by her young parents. Three more girls followed Olga: Tatiana on 10 June 1897, Maria on 26 June 1899 and Anastasia on 18 June 1901.

40|$|<b>Hemophilia</b> {{involves}} <b>a</b> lifelong burden {{from the}} perspective of the patient and the entire healthcare system. Advances in genetic testing provide valuable information to hemophilia-affected families for family planning. The aim of this study was to analyze the cost-effectiveness of carrier and prenatal genetic testing in the health-economic framework in Taiwan. Methods: A questionnaire was developed to assess the attitudes towards genetic testing for hemophilia. We modeled clinical outcomes of the proposed testing scheme by using the decision tree method. Incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted, based on data from the National Health Insurance (NHI) database and a questionnaire survey. Results: From the NHI database, 1111 hemophilic patients were identified and required an average medical expenditure of approximately New Taiwan (NT) $ 2. 1 million per patient-year in 2009. By using the decision tree model, we estimated that 26 potential carriers need to be tested to prevent one case of <b>hemophilia.</b> At <b>a</b> screening rate of 79 %, carrier and prenatal genetic testing would cost NT $ 85. 9 million, which would be offset by an incremental saving of NT $ 203 million per year by preventing 96 cases of hemophilia. Assuming that the life expectancy for hemophilic patients is 70 years, genetic testing could further save NT $ 14. 2 billion. Higher screening rates would increase the savings for healthcare resources. Conclusion: Carrier and prenatal genetic testing for <b>hemophilia</b> is <b>a</b> cost-effective investment in healthcare allocation.
