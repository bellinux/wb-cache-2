The National Health Office was dissolved in 1951, as its goals were incorporated into the sorority's international program.|$|E
5|$|After {{the general}} {{election}} in November 1982, the incoming Michigan governor, James Blanchard, appointed Mansour in December to the directorship of the Michigan Department of Social Services (DSS); Michigan's biggest agency. The administrative position involved oversight of public <b>health</b> <b>programs</b> including disbursement of some $5million in federal monies from Medicaid for abortions. To accept the appointment, she asked for and received permission from her order and from Szoka. Szoka asked Mansour to publicly state her opposition to abortion; he said he originally gave his approval on this condition. Mansour did not follow his request. Though she personally disapproved of abortion, she knew that many others felt differently, and she determined that the poor should have equal access to abortion {{as long as it}} was legal.|$|E
5|$|Agnew's term as {{governor}} {{was marked by}} modestly progressive policies, which included tax reform, clean water regulations, and the repeal of laws against interracial marriage. Community <b>health</b> <b>programs</b> were expanded, as were higher educational and employment opportunities for those on low incomes. Steps were taken towards ending segregation in schools. Agnew's fair housing legislation was limited, applying only to new projects above a certain size. These were the first such laws passed south of the Mason–Dixon line. Agnew's attempt to adopt a new state constitution {{was rejected by the}} voters in a referendum.|$|E

5|$|Australian {{demographic}} trends {{will put}} pressure on the ADF in the future. Excluding other factors, the ageing of the Australian population will result in smaller numbers of potential recruits entering the Australian labour market each year. Some predictions are that population ageing will result in slower economic growth and increased government expenditure on pensions and <b>health</b> <b>programs.</b> As a result of these trends, the ageing of Australia's population may worsen the ADF's manpower situation and may force the Government to reallocate some of the Defence budget. Relatively few young Australians consider joining the military and the ADF has to compete for recruits against private sector firms which are able to offer higher salaries.|$|E
5|$|The United States Congress {{passed the}} James L. Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act on December 22, 2010, and President Barack Obama signed the act into law on January 2, 2011. It {{allocated}} $4.2 billion {{to create the}} World Trade Center Health Program, which provides testing and treatment for people suffering from long-term health problems related to the 9/11 attacks. The WTC Health Program replaced preexisting 9/11-related <b>health</b> <b>programs</b> such as the Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program and the WTC Environmental Health Center program.|$|E
5|$|There {{were also}} {{indirect}} and intangible {{costs of the}} eruption. Unemployment in the immediate region of Mount St. Helens rose tenfold in the weeks immediately following the eruption, {{and then returned to}} near-normal levels once timber-salvaging and ash-cleanup operations were underway. Only a small percentage of residents left the region because of lost jobs owing to the eruption. Several months after May 18, a few residents reported suffering stress and emotional problems, even though they had coped successfully during the crisis. Counties in the region requested funding for mental <b>health</b> <b>programs</b> to assist such people.|$|E

5|$|Washington State House Speaker Frank Chopp spearheaded {{a plan to}} use {{government}} funding to move community college <b>health</b> <b>programs</b> into the building. In August 2013, the PHPDA announced a 30-year lease with the Washington State Department of Commerce for 13 stories of Pacific Tower. Six of the stories will be subleased to Seattle Central Community College for its healthcare training programs. Multiple nonprofits are prospective tenants. Chopp and other state lawmakers planned on consolidating several district offices into the location. The state capital budget allocated $20 million for the tower's renovation, but the cost increased to $54.3 million {{by the time it}} was completed in 2016 due to unexpected water damage and new city energy-use regulations.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to requesting international aid, the Yemen government declared Hadhramaut and Al Mahrah governorates as disaster areas, after then-president Ali Abdullah Saleh surveyed the affected areas. The president also utilized the nation's military to assist storm victims, and sent aircraft with tents, food, and medicine {{to the worst}} hit areas. To {{raise money for the}} disaster recovery, the Yemeni government cut one day of salary for all workers, equating to $4.25million, and the government provided another $100million from its annual budget. Local charities and residents collectively raised $8.5million. Yemen's Red Cross provided meals and water to about 21,000people. The agency also provided school kits for 4,500students whose facilities were damaged. Ultimately, the Red Cross assisted over 70,000storm victims through <b>health</b> <b>programs,</b> and also helped residents cope with stress, hygiene promotion, and other ongoing vulnerabilities to their livelihoods.|$|E

The appropriation was renewed in the fiscal year 2009 and again in FY 2010.

40|$|The United States lacks a {{coherent}} national <b>health</b> <b>program.</b> Current programs leave major gaps in coverage and recently {{have become more}} restrictive. Influential policies that have failed to correct crucial problems of the health-care system include competitive strategies, corporate intervention, and public-sector cutbacks with bureaucratic expansion. A national <b>health</b> <b>program</b> that combines elements of national health insurance and a national health service is a policy that would help solve current health-care problems. Previous proposals for national health insurance contained weaknesses that would need correction under a national program. Based on the experiences of other economically advanced countries, a national <b>health</b> <b>program</b> could provide universal entitlement to health care while controlling costs and improving the health-care system through structural reorganization. Current proposals for a national <b>health</b> <b>program</b> contain several basic principles dealing with the scope of services, copayments, financing, cost controls, physician and professional associations, personnel and distribution, prevention, and participation in policy making.
