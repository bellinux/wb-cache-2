5|$|Fenwick's {{beliefs are}} similar to Trollope's own. In his early life, the novelist was a {{supporter}} of the Tractarians. However, beginning in about the mid-1860s, his sympathies tended increasingly toward the Broad church. He defended Bishop Colenso, expressed <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> literal truth of the Old Testament, and questioned the doctrine of eternal punishment contained in the Athanasian Creed.|$|E
5|$|The last taxonomic {{delineation}} of the jaguar subspecies {{was performed}} by Pocock in 1939. Based on geographic origins and skull morphology, he recognized eight subspecies. However, {{he did not have}} access to sufficient specimens to critically evaluate all subspecies, and he expressed <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> status of several. Later consideration of his work suggested only three subspecies should be recognized.|$|E

5|$|If {{there is}} <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{cause of the}} skin lesions, a biopsy of the skin may be {{performed}} to distinguish the purpura from other diseases that cause it, such as vasculitis due to cryoglobulinemia; on microscopy the appearances are of a hypersensitivity vasculitis, and immunofluorescence demonstrates IgA and C3 (a protein of the complement system) in the blood vessel wall. However, overall serum complement levels are normal.|$|E
5|$|The {{symptoms}} of pneumothorax can be vague and inconclusive, especially {{in those with}} a small PSP; confirmation with medical imaging is usually required. In contrast, tension pneumothorax is a medical emergency and may be treated before imaging – especially if there is severe hypoxia, very low blood pressure, or an impaired level of consciousness. In tension pneumothorax, X-rays are sometimes required if there is <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> anatomical location of the pneumothorax.|$|E
5|$|In some instances, lumbar {{puncture}} {{may be required}} {{if there is a}} suspicion that the symptoms might be caused by other problems (meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage). This is the examination of the cerebrospinal fluid that envelops the brain and the spinal cord; the sample is obtained with a needle that is passed under local anesthetic into the spine. In pituitary apoplexy the results are typically normal, although abnormalities may be detected if blood from the pituitary has entered the subarachnoid space. If there is remaining <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> possibility of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), a magnetic resonance angiogram (MRI with a contrast agent) may be required to identify aneurysms of the brain blood vessels, {{the most common cause of}} SAH.|$|E

5|$|Khmer is {{a member}} of the Austroasiatic {{language}} family, the autochthonous family in an area that stretches from the Malay Peninsula through Southeast Asia to East India. Austroasiatic, which also includes Mon, Vietnamese and Munda, has been studied since 1856 and was first proposed as a language family in 1907. Despite the amount of research, there is still <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> internal relationship of the languages of Austroasiatic. Diffloth places Khmer in an eastern branch of the Mon-Khmer languages. In these classification schemes Khmer's closest genetic relatives are the Bahnaric and Pearic languages. More recent classifications doubt the validity of the Mon-Khmer sub-grouping and place the Khmer language as its own branch of Austroasiatic equidistant from the other 12 branches of the family.|$|E
5|$|Other {{problems}} {{affected the}} quantity and quality of his forces. Many of his men's enlistments were due to expire before Christmas, and many soldiers were inclined to leave the army when their commission ended. Several deserted before their enlistments were up. The pending loss of forces, the series of lost battles, the loss of New York, the flight of the Army along with many New Yorkers and the Second Continental Congress to Philadelphia, left many in <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> prospects of winning the war. But Washington persisted. He successfully procured supplies and dispatched men to recruit new members of the militia, which was successful in part due to British and Hessian mistreatment of New Jersey and Pennsylvania residents.|$|E
5|$|Since 1979, Pachylemur has {{generally}} been regarded as a distinct genus, but some classifications include the genus in Lemur or the ruffed lemur genus Varecia. In a 1982 review, Ian Tattersall recognized two species, Lemur insignis and Lemur jullyi. He did not regard Pachylemur as a distinct genus or even subgenus. As Tattersall noted, Lemur jullyi Standing, 1904, is preoccupied by Palaeochirogalus jullyi Grandidier, 1899, and thus invalid. However, both names are based on material from the central plateau of Madagascar and Tattersall therefore presumed that they {{belong to the same}} species, which he could continue to call Lemur jullyi. Recent classifications recognize Pachylemur as a valid genus with two species—P.insignis (Filhol, 1895) and P.jullyi (Grandidier, 1899)—but express <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> distinction between the two species.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} skyscrapers in New Orleans {{began with the}} {{construction}} of the Hennan Building in 1895; this building, rising , is often regarded as the first skyscraper in New Orleans. The 20-story Hibernia Bank Building, constructed in 1921 at a height of , held the title of the tallest in New Orleans for 44 years. But, for most of the 20th century, the skyline of New Orleans consisted of only low and mid-rise structures. The soft soils of New Orleans are susceptible to subsidence, and there was <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> feasibility of constructing large high-rises in such an environment.|$|E
5|$|While the {{persecution}} under Constantius was relatively light, {{there is no}} <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> force of {{the persecution}} in Maximian's domain. Its effects are recorded at Rome, Sicily, Spain, and in Africaindeed, Maximian encouraged particularly strict enforcement of the edict in Africa. Africa's political elite were insistent that the persecution be fulfilled, and Africa's Christians, especially in Numidia, were equally insistent on resisting them. For the Numidians, to hand over scriptures {{was an act of}} terrible apostasy. Africa had long been home to the Church of the Martyrsin Africa, martyrs held more religious authority than the clergyand harbored a particularly intransigent, fanatical, and legalistic variety of Christianity. It was Africa that gave the West most of its martyrdoms.|$|E
5|$|With {{the death}} of his last {{contemporary}} on the faculty in 1845, Tucker resigned his professorship and moved to Philadelphia, where he enjoyed the availability of more libraries, meetings at the American Philosophical Society and a reunion with his friend Robley Dunglison. Nevertheless, there were drawbacks – for one, the lack of accommodation that slaveholding had brought him—he had emancipated all five of his slaves upon his departure from Charlottesville. He later expressed <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> wisdom of the latter decision when he learned that three of them had, by law, been exiled from Virginia, and shortly thereafter died. As well, the two freed slaves who accompanied him to Philadelphia immediately deserted their posts upon arrival there.|$|E

5|$|<b>Doubt</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{possibility}} of a mechanistic explanation of thought drove René Descartes, and most other philosophers along with him, to dualism: {{the belief that the}} mind is to some degree independent of the brain. There has always, however, been a strong argument in the opposite direction. There is clear empirical evidence that physical manipulations of, or injuries to, the brain (for example by drugs or by lesions, respectively) can affect the mind in potent and intimate ways. In the 19th century, the case of Phineas Gage, a railway worker who was injured by a stout iron rod passing through his brain, convinced both researchers and the public that cognitive functions were localised in the brain. Following this line of thinking, a large body of empirical evidence for a close relationship between brain activity and mental activity has led most neuroscientists and contemporary philosophers to be materialists, believing that mental phenomena are ultimately the result of, or reducible to, physical phenomena.|$|E
5|$|Nothomyrmecia is {{only found}} in Australia. Until its rediscovery, the genus was only {{known from the}} {{original}} specimens collected in Western Australia by Amy Crocker in December 1931. Entomologist Robert W. Taylor expressed <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> type locality of the ant, but said that the specimens were probably collected from {{the western end of}} the Great Australian Bight, south from Balladonia. Entomologists feared that Nothomyrmecia was extinct, as notable biologists such as E.O. Wilson made attempts to find the ant but failed to do so. In 1977, Taylor rediscovered Nothomyrmecia in Poochera, 1300km (800mi) away from the original collection site. Colonies are found in old growth mallee woodland with many Eucalyptus species such as Eucalyptus brachycalyx, Eucalyptus oleosa and Eucalyptus gracilis abundant. Only a few small colonies are known in its restricted distribution, listing it as Critically Endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.|$|E
5|$|Whilst nineteenth- and to {{a lesser}} extent twentieth-century attitudes often {{suggested}} that any well-constructed pre-modern road surface must be Roman, late twentieth-century archaeologists were more open to evaluating the structure within the context of a wider span of historical periods. After an early allowance by Phillips in 1853 that the causeway could be British rather than Roman there was little further investigation of such a possibility. In 1994, the Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England began a review of the date or origin for the Wheeldale causeway. Detailed air photography of the Cawthorn camps in 1999 site failed to find evidence of a road leading towards Wheeldale Moor from the camps to which it is historically related, and the causeway does not obviously connect to the main Roman road network. Several writers around the turn of the millennium began to express <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> established narrative for the structure as a Roman road. Twenty-first century archaeologists then found several exemplars of other cambered, metalled roads that pre-date the Roman presence in Britain, and hence set precedence for the possibility of a pre-Roman origin for the Wheeldale causeway. Several sources from the mid-1990s onwards have suggested that the structure may be a pre-Roman (Iron Age) road of uncertain route or purpose.|$|E
