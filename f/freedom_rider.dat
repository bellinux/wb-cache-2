500|$|Timmons was {{reported}} to be dissatisfied with the money he had received from [...] "This Here", and was enticed in February 1960 into leaving Adderley and returning to Blakey's band by the offer of more pay. Timmons then appeared on further well-known albums with the drummer, including A Night in Tunisia, The <b>Freedom</b> <b>Rider</b> and The Witch Doctor. His own recording debut as sole leader was This Here Is Bobby Timmons in 1960, which contained his first versions of his best-known compositions. In the same year, he played on recordings led by Nat Adderley, Arnett Cobb, and Johnny Griffin, among others; on the first of these, Work Song, Timmons did not appear on all of the tracks, because he had been drinking heavily.|$|E

Knocked unconscious, he was not picked up until police arrived 10 minutes later, with Montgomery Police Commissioner Lester B. Sullivan noting, [...] "We have no {{intention}} of standing police guard for a bunch of troublemakers coming into our city." ...|$|E

50|$|Barnett {{arranged}} for the arrest of <b>Freedom</b> <b>Riders</b> in 1961 and then imprisoned them at Parchman Farm. While their offenses were minor, the <b>Freedom</b> <b>Riders</b> were strip-searched, had beds taken away, and were humiliated and brutalized in the prison.|$|R
50|$|Although {{there was}} state patrolmen {{there during the}} {{incident}} and gave off warning shots to call off the mob, they did very little to protect the <b>Freedom</b> <b>Riders</b> from being burnt alive and beaten. The majority of the <b>Freedom</b> <b>Riders</b> that were intercepted in Anniston sustained many life-threatening injuries either from the beatings done by the Ku Klux Klan, or from prolonged exposure to the smoke and fumes from the destroyed bus, and were sent to Anniston Memorial Hospital for immediate attention. When an ambulance arrived, some of the black <b>Freedom</b> <b>Riders</b> were refused {{a ride to the}} hospital by the driver until several white <b>Freedom</b> <b>Riders</b> who were injured, got off the bus and only came if their fellow Riders who were black could be allowed to ride. When the injured <b>Freedom</b> <b>Riders</b> arrived at the hospital there was no doctor present, only nurses to provide aid to those in need. They were eventually denied receiving medical attention since they caused a commotion by bringing the white mob over to the hospital. Even though Gary Thomas Rowe informed the FBI three weeks prior that the attack on <b>Freedom</b> <b>Riders</b> would happen, they decided not to intervene but only to ask what had happened to Genevieve Hughes, {{who was one of the}} injured <b>Freedom</b> <b>Riders,</b> with her only stating, “When I woke up the nurse asked me if I could talk with the FBI. The FBI man did not care about us, but only the bombing”.|$|R
2500|$|To {{support his}} family, Aelony {{and his wife}} owned a small {{business}} selling security products for commercial buildings. As a matter of principle, they did not sell any equipment designed to injure people, such as guns or knives. Aelony became an advocate for civil rights and social justice beginning in his teen years. [...] From his earliest years he was an admirer of Mahatma Gandhi and non-violent resistance to injustice. At the University of Minnesota, Aelony helped found Students for Integration, a group dedicated to gaining housing and employment for black and minority students. Aelony was arrested several times for testing the ban on segregated interstate travel in the Deep South as a <b>Freedom</b> <b>Rider.</b> He was famously arrested and served time on death row in Americus, Georgia, for attempting to register black voters.|$|E
2500|$|In 1963, Aelony {{was asked}} {{to go back to}} Sumter County, Georgia, where Koinonia is located, to the town of Americus to assist with a voter {{registration}} drive there. Aelony worked with SNCC and the local Sumter County Movement to help blacks register to vote. He taught protest standards to picketers at a local restaurant, and he also showed the group’s photographer how to take pictures that would be useful in court. He performed similar activities in Ocala, Florida. [...] When Aelony took a sample picture, a deputy arrived and asked him to stop photographing. [...] Zev said 'it's a free country' [...] and was immediately arrested. He was taken to jail in Ocala. Officers told the inmates he was a <b>Freedom</b> <b>Rider,</b> and left him unattended in the jail 'bullpen where he was beaten unconscious and kicked until a woman visitor called attention to the abuse. Aelony was eventually released after the intervention of Minnesota's governor, who was attending the Governor's Conference in Miami, [...] and he returned to Americus. The arrests in Americus continued to take place; hundreds of people who were a part of the voting rights drive were taken to a camp outside of town.|$|E

50|$|That night, the {{hospital}}ized <b>Freedom</b> <b>Riders,</b> most of {{whom had}} been refused care, were removed from the hospital at 2 AM, because the staff feared the mob outside the hospital. The local civil rights leader Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth organized several cars of black citizens to rescue the injured <b>Freedom</b> <b>Riders</b> in defiance of the white supremacists. The black people were under the leadership of Colonel Stone Johnson and were openly armed as they arrived at the hospital, protecting the <b>Freedom</b> <b>Riders</b> from the mob.|$|R
