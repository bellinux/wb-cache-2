5|$|After the Royal Rumble {{event in}} late January 2014, CM Punk {{reportedly}} legitimately {{walked out on}} WWE while still under contract and WWE stopped promoting him for future events; which Pro Wrestling Torch editor Wade Keller analysed as playing a part in Daniel Bryan's WrestleMania journey. In May 2014, Bryan revealed {{in an interview that}} he also believed that WWE decided to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> big WrestleMania spotlight only after Punk quit.|$|E
5|$|Armatus, as magister militum, {{was sent}} with all {{available}} forces in Asia Minor, {{to oppose the}} advancing army of the Isaurians, but secret messages from Zeno, who promised to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> title of magister militum for life and to confer the rank of Caesar on his son, induced him to betray his master. Armatus avoided the road by which Zeno was advancing and marched into Isauria by another way. This betrayal decided the fate of Basiliscus.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 2009, Brodeur broke {{a number}} of career records for goaltenders. He missed 50 games in the 2008–09 season, but a winning streak upon his return pushed him near the NHL's all-time win record. On March 14, 2009, the Devils {{defeated}} the Canadiens 3–1 to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> 551st win of his career, tying him with Roy for the NHL record. Three days later, Brodeur surpassed Roy with a 3–2 win over the Chicago Blackhawks in New Jersey.|$|E

6000|$|... 34. But {{the most}} curious passage of all, and fullest of meaning, {{is when she}} gives {{strength}} to Menelaus, that he may stand unwearied against Hector. He prays to her: [...] "And blue-eyed Athena was glad that he prayed to her, first; and she <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> strength in his shoulders, and in his limbs, an she <b>gave</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> courage"--of what animal, do you suppose? Had it been Neptune or Mars, they would have <b>given</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> courage of a bull, or a lion; but Athena <b>gives</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> courage of the most fearless in attack of all creatures, small or great, and very small it is, but wholly incapable of terror,--she <b>gives</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> courage of a fly.|$|R
5|$|Cage and Vrataski {{infiltrate}} the MoD Main Building {{to obtain a}} prototype built by Carter that can locate the Omega.

Cliff divulges to the mobsters that the actor is a Nazi; Valentine's gang turn their weapons on Sinclair and Lothar, but Sinclair summons sixty heavily armed Nazi S.A. commandos hidden at the observatory. The Nazi rigid airship Luxembourg appears {{overhead}} to evacuate Sinclair. FBI agents suddenly announce their presence, having secretly surrounded the area; {{they and the}} mobsters join forces to battle the Nazis. Sinclair and Lothar escape, dragging Jenny with them aboard the airship.|$|E
5|$|During his youth, Olajuwon was {{a soccer}} goalkeeper, which helped <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> {{footwork}} and agility to balance his {{size and strength}} in basketball, and also contributed to his shot-blocking ability. Olajuwon did not play basketball {{until the age of}} 17, when he entered a local tournament. It has been said that a coach in Nigeria once asked him to dunk and demonstrated while standing on a chair. Olajuwon then tried to stand on the chair himself. When redirected by staff not to use the chair, Hakeem could initially not dunk the basketball.|$|E

5|$|In 788 Hygeberht {{traveled}} to Rome {{and received a}} pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority, from Pope Hadrian I. In one surviving charter of 788 Hygeberht is listed with the title of bishop, but another from late 788 gives him the title of archbishop. More charters from 789 and 792 also <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> title of archbishop, and he continued to be named as such on charters until 799.|$|E
5|$|Kallikrates – {{an ancient}} Greek, {{the husband of}} Amenartas, and {{ancestor}} of Leo. Two thousand years ago, he and Amenartas fled Egypt, seeking a haven in the African interior where they met Ayesha.

5|$|Meanwhile, Mr. Burns learns of the school's oil and {{immediately}} decides {{that he must}} have it, even as Smithers voices his disapproval. After failing to convince Principal Skinner to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> oil, Mr. Burns establishes a slant drilling operation and beats the school to tapping the oil well. The school is told they have no legal recourse, and Willie and Puente are laid off to cover the school's losses.|$|E

5|$|On October3, it was {{reported}} that he was retained by Boston under the reserve clause. When interviewed during the off-season, Stivetts claimed {{that he would like to}} quit pitching and play first, that is if a team would <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> opportunity. Selee, Boston's manager, disagreed and claimed that the team needed Stivetts in the pitching rotation instead. It was also likely that he would have received less salary playing at first.|$|E
5|$|Some Democrats {{remained}} unsatisfied {{with the}} outcome of the Music Hall Convention. After a period of silence, candidate William Stone publicly detailed the arrangement he believed he had with Goebel and how Goebel had broken it. Although Goebel's allies attempted to defend him against the charges, Stone's story was soon corroborated by former congressman W. C. Owens. Owens called on Democrats to vote for the Republican candidate, and to do so in such large numbers that no amount of political wrangling by Goebel could <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> governorship.|$|E
5|$|The {{final stage}} of the race was a flat stage that {{finished}} in Madrid. It was won in a sprint by Degenkolb. During the stage, Valverde took advantage of a puncture for Rodríguez and won the intermediate sprint to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> points jersey. Although Aru lost a little time in a split in the peloton at the finish line, {{the rest of the}} standings were unchanged. Aru therefore won the race, his first Grand Tour victory.|$|E
60|$|Barry {{looked at}} his watch: it was near eight o'clock, {{but he seemed to}} feel that all he had drank had had no effect on him: it had not <b>given</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> usual pluck; it had not <b>given</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> feeling of {{reckless}} assurance, which he mistook for courage and capacity.|$|R

5|$|As marine {{creatures that}} reside {{in either the}} depths or the poles, humans {{knew very little about}} whales over the course of history; many feared or revered them. The Nords and various arctic tribes revered the whale as they were {{important}} pieces of their lives. In Inuit creation myths, when 'Big Raven', a deity in human form, found a stranded whale, he was told by the Great Spirit where to find special mushrooms that would <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> strength to drag the whale back to the sea and thus, return order to the world. In an Icelandic legend, a man threw a stone at a fin whale and hit the blowhole, causing the whale to burst. The man was told not to go to sea for twenty years, but during the nineteenth year he went fishing and a whale came and killed him.|$|E
5|$|By 1889 Verdi {{had been}} an opera {{composer}} for more than fifty years. He had written 27 operas, of which only one was a comedy, his second work, Un giorno di regno, staged unsuccessfully in 1840. His fellow composer Rossini commented that he admired Verdi greatly, but thought him incapable of writing a comedy. Verdi disagreed {{and said that he}} longed to write another light-hearted opera, but nobody would <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> chance. He had included moments of comedy even in his tragic operas, for example in Un ballo in maschera and La forza del destino.|$|E
5|$|During {{his term}} as praetor in the Iberian Peninsula (modern Portugal and Spain), Pompey's {{contemporary}} Julius Caesar defeated two local tribes in battle. After his term as consul in 59 BC, {{he was appointed}} to a five-year term as the proconsular Governor of Cisalpine Gaul (part of current northern Italy), Transalpine Gaul (current southern France) and Illyria (part of the modern Balkans). Not content with an idle governorship, Caesar strove to find reason to invade Gaul (modern France and Belgium), which would <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> dramatic military success he sought. When two local tribes began to migrate on a route that would take them near (not into) the Roman province of Transalpine Gaul, Caesar had the barely sufficient excuse he needed for his Gallic Wars, fought between 58 BC and 49 BC.|$|E

5|$|Gee (Yaphet Kotto) {{informs the}} detectives that Officer Thormann (Lee Tergesen) {{has been shot}} in the head, and he orders an {{immediate}} investigation. Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti (Jon Polito) arrive at the hospital to find the doctors working frantically on Thormann; Crosetti, a close friend of Thormann, becomes very emotional. Crosetti comforts Thormann's wife Eva (Edie Falco), but is privately told by Dr. Eli Devilbiss (Sean Whitesell) that Thormann may be blind or mentally disabled, even if he survives. Crosetti begs Gee to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> case and, even though Gee believes he is too emotionally involved, he gives in when Crosetti tries to make him feel guilty by showing him his previous gunshot wounds. When an investigation at the crime scene turns up nothing, Lewis catches Crosetti praying with a rosary in the locker room. Crosetti convinces a skeptical Lewis to pray with him for help in the investigation.|$|E
5|$|Goebel lost a close {{election}} to Republican William S. Taylor. When the General Assembly's session opened on January 2, 1900, {{the election results}} were immediately challenged. With Democrats in control of both houses of the Assembly, the results seemed sure to be reversed. The Assembly was still deliberating on January 30, 1900, when Goebel was shot by an unknown assailant {{as he entered the}} state capitol building. The following day, as Goebel was being treated for his wounds at a local hotel, the General Assembly invalidated enough votes to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> election. He was sworn into office from his bed the same day. Three days later Goebel died, never having risen from the bed.|$|E
5|$|In March 1081, Melissenos was encamped {{with his}} army at Damalis, on the Asian shore across the Bosporus from Constantinople. There, he {{received}} {{news of the}} revolt of the Komnenoi against Botaneiates and the proclamation of Alexios Komnenos as emperor. He sent letters to the Komnenoi, suggesting a division of authority over the imperial territory, with the Balkans remaining under Komnenian control and himself keeping Asia Minor, although he also emphasized that the Byzantine Empire should remain united. In reply, the Komnenoi offered to recognize him as Caesar – the second highest dignity after the imperial title itself – and to <b>give</b> <b>him</b> <b>the</b> governance of Thessalonica – the Empire's second-most important city – if he would submit to them. Melissenos initially refused to accept this offer, but as the Komnenoi {{were on the verge}} of taking Constantinople and might refuse to make similar concessions later, he eventually agreed.|$|E
