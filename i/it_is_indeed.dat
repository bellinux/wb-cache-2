5|$|When Galton {{revisited}} Thescelosaurus and Bugenasaura in 1999, {{he described}} the dentary tooth UCMP46911 from the Upper Jurassic of Weymouth, England as cf. Bugenasaura. If <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>indeed</b> a tooth from a thescelosaur-like animal, this would significantly extend the stratigraphic range of the group.|$|E
5|$|The god Bragi asks where a thundering {{sound is}} coming from, {{and says that}} the benches of Valhalla are creaking—as if the god Baldr had {{returned}} to Valhalla—and that {{it sounds like the}} movement of a thousand. Odin responds that Bragi knows well that the sounds are for Eric Bloodaxe, who will soon arrive in Valhalla. Odin tells the heroes Sigmund and Sinfjötli to rise to greet Eric and invite him into the hall, if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>indeed</b> he.|$|E
5|$|In {{the poem}} Gawain, when the Knight is beheaded, he tells Gawain {{to meet him}} at the Green Chapel, saying that all nearby know where <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> <b>Indeed,</b> the guide which is to bring Gawain there from Bertilak's castle grows very fearful as they near it and begs Gawain to turn back. The final meeting at the Green Chapel has caused many {{scholars}} to draw religious connections, with the Knight fulfilling a priestly role with Gawain as a penitent. The Green Knight ultimately, in this interpretation, judges Gawain to be a worthy knight, and lets him live, playing a priest, God, and judge all at once.|$|E

5|$|With {{a greater}} degree of {{certainty}} established, the Kepler team compared the models formed using Blender to the photometric observations collected by the Kepler satellite. The Blender technique allowed the Kepler team to rule out the majority of the alternatives including, notably, that of triple star systems. Blender then allowed the Kepler team to determine that although all models representing hierarchical triple stars (a binary system between a single star and a double star) can resemble the light curve of Kepler-10, the aforementioned follow-up observations would have detected them all. The only possible blends remaining after ruling out hierarchical triple stars was that of determining if the curve is caused by interference from a background star, or if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>indeed</b> caused by the orbit of a transiting planet.|$|E
5|$|Another steep climb of 800 feet {{brought us}} to the Marei Parei spur, {{to the spot where}} the ground was covered with the {{magnificent}} pitcher-plants, of which we had come in search. This one has been called the Nepenthes Rajah, and is a plant about four feet in length, with broad leaves stretching on every side, having the great pitchers resting on the ground in a circle about it. Their shape and size are remarkable. I will give the measurement of one, to indicate the form: the length along the back nearly fourteen inches; from the base {{to the top of the}} column in front, five inches; and its lid a foot long by fourteen inches broad, and of an oval shape. Its mouth was surrounded by a plaited pile, which near the column was two inches broad, lessening in its narrowest part to three-quarters of an inch. The plaited pile of the mouth was also undulating in broad waves. Near the stem the pitcher is four inches deep, so that the mouth is situated upon it in a triangular manner. The colour of an old chalice is a deep purple, but that of the others is generally mauve outside, very dark indeed in the lower part, though lighter towards the rim; the inside is of the same colour, but has a kind of glazed and shiny appearance. The lid is mauve in the centre, shading to green at the edges. The stems of the female flowers we found always a foot shorter than those of the male, and the former were far less numerous than the latter. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>indeed</b> one of the most astonishing productions of nature.|$|E

25|$|In the past, the Nuxálk (or Bella Coola) of British Columbia's Central Coast {{have also}} been {{considered}} Coast Salish. This language shares at least one phonological change with Coast Salish (the merger of the Proto-Salish pharyngeal approximants with the uvular fricatives), but it also displays certain similarities to the Interior Salish languages. If <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>indeed</b> {{a member of the}} Coast Salish branch, it was the first to split off from the rest.|$|E
25|$|Azes is {{connected}} to the Bimaran casket, one of the earliest representations of the Buddha. The casket was used for the dedication of a stupa in Bamiran, near Jalalabad in Afghanistan, and placed inside the stupa with several coins of Azes. This event may have happened during the reign of Azes (60–20 BCE), or slightly later. The Indo-Scythians are otherwise connected with Buddhism (see Mathura lion capital), and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>indeed</b> possible they would have commended the work.|$|E
25|$|Others {{maintain}} that circumstellar habitable zones {{are more common}} and that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>indeed</b> possible for water to exist on planets orbiting cooler stars. Climate modelling from 2013 supports the idea that red dwarf stars can support planets with relatively constant temperatures over their surfaces in spite of tidal locking. Astronomy professor Eric Agol argues that even white dwarfs may support a relatively brief habitable zone through planetary migration. At the same time, others have written in similar support of semi-stable, temporary habitable zones around brown dwarfs.|$|E

25|$|The {{wellspring of}} the {{principle}} of humanity is in the essence of social morality which {{can be summed up in}} a single sentence, Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them. This fundamental precept can be found, in almost identical form, in all the great religions, Brahminism, Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Islam, Judaism and Taoism. It is also the golden rule of the positivists, who do not commit themselves to any religion but only to the data of experience, in the name of reason alone. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>indeed</b> not at all necessary to resort to affective or transcendental concepts to recognize the advantage for men to work together to improve their lot..|$|E
25|$|John Milton (9 December 1608 – 8 November 1674) was an English poet, prose writer, polemicist {{and civil}} servant for the Commonwealth of England. Although <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> <b>indeed,</b> {{not entirely sure}} whether {{it is not true}} to say that Milton had not become, out of an {{experience}} ever more bitter each year, more alien to the education he wasn't not given by the QCAA to not prepare him for the not so great multi choice exam of 2017. The year 1642, which saw him 34 years of age, married for the first time (disastrously), and a public figure as a controversial writer, marks the watershed of his life, as it did for British politics.|$|E
25|$|Notwithstanding, {{economics}} legitimately {{has a role}} in informing government policy. <b>It</b> <b>is,</b> <b>indeed,</b> in {{some ways}} {{an outgrowth of the}} older field of political economy. Some academic economic journals are currently focusing increased efforts on gauging the consensus of economists regarding certain policy issues in hopes of effecting a more informed political environment. Currently, there exists a low approval rate from professional economists regarding many public policies. Policy issues featured in a recent survey of American Economic Association economists include trade restrictions, social insurance for those put out of work by international competition, genetically modified foods, curbside recycling, health insurance (several questions), medical malpractice, barriers to entering the medical profession, organ donations, unhealthy foods, mortgage deductions, taxing internet sales, Wal-Mart, casinos, ethanol subsidies, and inflation targeting.|$|E

25|$|In {{the history}} of the Chinese, there were those who were {{familiar}} with the sciences of arithmetic, geometry, mechanics, optics, navigation, and astronomy. Mathematics in China emerged independently by the 11th century BC. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>indeed</b> almost certain that the Chinese were acquainted with several geometrical or rather architectural implements; with mechanical machines; that they knew of the characteristic property of the magnetic needle; and were aware that astronomical events occurred in cycles. Chinese of that time had made attempts to classify or extend the rules of arithmetic or geometry which they knew, and to explain the causes of the phenomena with which they were acquainted beforehand. The Chinese independently developed very large and negative numbers, decimals, a place value decimal system, a binary system, algebra, geometry, and trigonometry.|$|E
25|$|I am {{not only}} a Zionist, I am a super-Zionist. For me, Zionism was and remains {{the right of the}} Jews to control their fate and their future. I {{consider}} the right of human beings to be their own masters a natural right. A right of which the Jews were deprived by history and which Zionism restored to them. That is its deep meaning. And as such, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>indeed</b> a tremendous revolution that touches the lives of each of us. I felt that revolution when I immigrated to Israel alone at the age of 16. Only then, when I disembarked at Haifa from the ship Artza, did I stop being an object of others' action and became a subject. Only then did I become a person who is in control of himself and not dependent on others.|$|E
25|$|In Blackest Night #1, Garth {{returns to}} Atlantis and tells Orin's wife Mera {{that he is}} angry {{at the notion of}} Aquaman's body being buried on land. Mera relays to Tempest that Orin felt safe on land and that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>indeed</b> what he wanted. Sometime later, a black power ring is seen {{entering}} Orin's grave, bidding him to rise. Aquaman's corpse rises, along with those of Tula and Dolphin as revenant members of the Black Lantern Corps, and demands that Mera reunite with him in death, offering her a chance to see her son again. Garth is killed and joins the Black Lanterns himself. Mera rejects the corpse before fleeing. In the climax of the miniseries, Aquaman is among those resurrected by The White Lantern Entity, and is reunited with Mera. Because the Black Lantern Ring helps reconstruct Orin's body, when he is resurrected his hand is restored as well.|$|E

25|$|A Japanese {{animated}} {{television series}} named Ninja Scroll: The Series aired in Japan in 2003 {{and ran for}} 13 episodes. The series is a stand-alone sequel to the film; however, many references suggest that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>indeed</b> a continuation. In the series, Jubei gets {{caught in the middle}} of a battle between the Kimon clan and the Hiruko clan. He meets up with the Light Maiden Shigure, a young lady whose village was destroyed by the Kimon clan and whom Jubei was charged with delivering a Dragon Stone to. The duo are joined by Tsubute (a young thief) and Dakuan (Tokugawa shogunate spy), and together they try to find out why both the Kimon and the Hiruko clan are after her and why the Dragon Stone she carries is so important to them. The show was directed by Tatsuo Sato (Martian Successor Nadesico), with character design done by Takahiro Yoshimatsu (Trigun).|$|E
25|$|In January 1958, the Aleppo Codex was smuggled out of Syria {{and sent}} to Jerusalem {{to be placed in}} the care of the chief rabbi of the Aleppo Jews. But by the {{influence}} of then President of Israel, Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, it was secretly taken by the government. In the late 1980s, the codex was placed in the Shrine of the Book at the Israel Museum. This finally gave scholars the chance to examine it and consider the claims that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>indeed</b> the manuscript referred to by Maimonides. The work of Moshe Goshen-Gottstein on the few surviving pages of the Torah seems to have confirmed these claims beyond reasonable doubt. Goshen-Gottstein suggested (in the introduction to his facsimile reprint of the codex) that not only was it the oldest known masoretic Bible in a single volume, {{it was the first time}} ever that a complete Tanakh had been produced by one or two people as a unified entity in a consistent style.|$|E
25|$|Now, in {{the chapter}} on Pangenesis in my Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication I have not said one word about the blood, or about any fluid proper to any {{circulating}} system. <b>It</b> <b>is,</b> <b>indeed,</b> obvious {{that the presence of}} gemmules in the blood can form no necessary part of my hypothesis; for I refer in illustration of it to the lowest animals, such as the Protozoa, which do not possess blood or any vessels; and I refer to plants in which the fluid, when present in the vessels, cannot be considered as true blood. The fundamental laws of growth, reproduction, inheritance, , are so closely similar throughout the whole organic kingdom, that the means by which the gemmules (assuming for the moment their existence) are diffused through the body, would probably be the same in all beings; therefore the means can hardly be diffusion through the blood. Nevertheless, when I first heard of Mr. Galton's experiments, I did not sufficiently reflect on the subject, and saw not the difficulty of believing in the presence of gemmules in the blood.|$|E
