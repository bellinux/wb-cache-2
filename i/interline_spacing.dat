40|$|Abstract—In this letter, {{we develop}} a novel process {{to fill the}} <b>interline</b> <b>space</b> with air (dielectric {{constant}} = 1). A silicon wafer, whose face is downward, patterned with metal lines, {{is placed on the}} top of another silicon wafer coated with dry polyimide. Hydrogen silsesquioxanes (HSQ), FOx- 16, is diluted and trickled through the slit between the metal lines and the polyimide. Then the HSQ forms an ultrathin liquid layer on the dry polyimide and contacts with the top of the metal lines. After the liquid HSQ becomes dry, the air gap is formed. The dry polyimide has good adhesion to silicon substrate but not to the dry FOx- 16, so we can separate the polyimide from the dry FOx- 16 and get the air gap. The liquid property of HSQ and its high selective adsorption between the metal lines and the polyimide are utilized to form the air gap.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of font size, <b>interline</b> <b>spacing,</b> and a tech-nology called ReadingMate on the letter-counting task performance of users running on a treadmill. Background: Few researchers have investigated how runners read text while running on a treadmill. Our previ-ous studies showed that ReadingMate had positive effects on the reading-while-running experience; however, the effect of other text conditions (i. e., font size and <b>interline</b> <b>spacing)</b> and the interplay between ReadingMate and such text conditions on the letter-counting task performance are not clearly understood. Method: Fifteen participants were recruited for the experiment. There were three main factors: display types (normal and ReadingMate), font sizes (8, 12, 16, and 20 point), and <b>interline</b> <b>spacing</b> (1. 0 ×, 1. 5 ×, 2. 0 ×, and 2. 5 ×). The researchers employed a letter-counting task. The performance was measured regarding task performance time, success rate of counting the target letter f, and number of give-ups. Results: Overall, the letter-counting task perfor-mance while running on a treadmill improved as font size and <b>interline</b> <b>spacing</b> increased, as expected. Read-ingMate was more effective than normal display par-ticularly when text was displayed in a small font size and with dense <b>interline</b> <b>spacing.</b> Conclusion: When text must be displayed in a small font size and with dense <b>interline</b> <b>spacing,</b> ReadingMate can be used to improve the users ’ task performance. Application: Practical applications of ReadingMate include improving the text-reading experience in shaky environments, such as in aviation, construction, and trans-portation...|$|E

40|$|International audiencePURPOSE. It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that crowding, the adverse low-level effect due to the proximity of adjacent stimuli, explains slow reading in low-vision patients with absolute macular scotomas. According to this hypothesis, crowding in the vertical dimension should be released by increasing the vertical spacing between lines of text. However, studies with different experimental paradigms and only a few observers have given discrepant results on this question. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate this issue with a large number of patients whose macular function was carefully assessed. METHODS. MP 1 microperimetry examination was performed for each low-vision patient. Only eyes with an absolute macular scotoma and no foveal sparing (61 patients with AMD, 90 eyes; four patients with Stargardt disease, eight eyes) were included. Maximal reading speed was assessed for each eye with French sentences designed on the MNREAD test principles. RESULTS. The effect of <b>interline</b> <b>spacing</b> on maximal reading speed (MRS) was significant although small; average MRS increased by 7. 1 words/min from standard to double <b>interline</b> <b>spacing.</b> The effect was weak irrespective of PRL distance from the fovea and scotoma area and regardless of whether an eccentric island of functional vision was present within the scotoma. CONCLUSIONS. Increasing <b>interline</b> <b>spacing</b> is advisable only for very slow readers (< 20 words/min) who want to read a few words (spot reading). Vertical crowding does not seem to be a major determinant of maximal reading speed for patients with central scotomas.

40|$|Line {{and word}} {{segmentation}} {{is one of}} the important step of OCR systems. In this paper we have proposed a robust method for segmentation of individual text lines based on the modified histogram obtained from run length based smearing. A complete line and word segmentation system for some popular Indian printed languages is presented here. Both foreground and background information are used here for accurate line segmentation. There may be some touching or overlapping characters between two consecutive text lines and most of the line segmentation errors are generated due to touching and overlapping character occurrences. Sometimes, <b>interline</b> <b>space</b> and noises make line segmentation a difficult task. Our method can take care of this situation accurately. Word segmentation from individual lines is also discussed here.

40|$|Evolution of {{a network}} of vortex loops in HeII due to the fusion and {{breakdown}} of vortex loops is studied. We perform investigation on the base of the "rate equation" for the distribution function n(l) of number of loops of length l proposed by Copeland with coauthors. By using the special ansatz in the "collision" integral we have found the exact power-like solution of "kinetic equation" in stationary case. That solution is the famous equilibrium distribution n(l) l^- 5 / 2 obtained earlier in numerical calculations. Our result, however, is not equilibrium, but on the contrary, it describes the state with two mutual fluxes of the length (or energy) in space of the vortex loop sizes. Analyzing this solution we drew several results on the structure and dynamics of the vortex tangle in the superfluid turbulent helium. In particular, we obtained that the mean radius of the curvature is of order of <b>interline</b> <b>space.</b> We also obtain that the decay of the vortex tangle obeys the Vinen equation, obtained earlier phenomenologically. We evaluate also the full rate of reconnection events. PACS-number 67. 40 Comment: 4 pages, submitted to PR...|$|R

So, the effects from its introduction upon the changes in carbon and nitrogen at different compartments of the soil organic matter were studied. This system is implanted in soil under eucalypt forest that was abandoned after three removal cuts. In the first year, besides planting the eucalyptuses in <b>interlines</b> at <b>spacing</b> 10 x 4 m, the following crops are grown: rice in the first year; soybean in the second one; and the brachiaria in the third one. After the third year, the brachiaria pasture by meat cattle was begun and remaining in that area {{until the end of}} the system cycle, what is foreseen for the 11 th year. A savannah area and another one with eucalypt planting under the conventional system were used as reference to natural condition and previous conditions to implantation of the agrosylvopasture system. Samples aged 1, 2, 3, 6, and 10 years were collected. The results show significant decrease in the contents and stocks of both total carbon and nitrogen, as well as in microbial biomass. As the system becomes older, it starts a tendency for the recuperation of the contents and stocks of those fractions. Among the humic substances, the fulvic acid fraction was less affected by the introduction of this system. Briefly, the results show the system is unfavorable to the maintenance of the soil organic matter at the first years, but presents a potential for recovering as its age advances...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCrowding {{is thought}} to be one potent {{limiting}} factor of reading in peripheral vision. While several studies investigated how crowding between horizontally adjacent letters or words can influence eccentric reading, little {{attention has been paid to}} the influence of vertically adjacent lines of text. The goal of this study was to examine the dependence of page mode reading performance (speed and accuracy) on <b>interline</b> <b>spacing.</b> A gaze-contingent visual display was used to simulate a visual central scotoma while normally sighted observers read meaningful French sentences following MNREAD principles. The sensitivity of this new material to low-level factors was confirmed by showing strong effects of perceptual learning, print size and scotoma size on reading performance. In contrast, reading speed was only slightly modulated by <b>interline</b> <b>spacing</b> even for the largest range tested: a 26 % gain for a 178 % increase in spacing. This modest effect sharply contrasts with the dramatic influence of vertical word spacing found in a recent RSVP study. This discrepancy suggests either that vertical crowding is minimized when reading meaningful sentences, or that the interaction between crowding and other factors such as attention and/or visuo-motor control is dependent on the paradigm used to assess reading speed (page vs. RSVP mode) ...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 60 - 61) Typographical cueing {{refers to}} the use of variations in the appearance of text while spatial cueing includes devices such as line spacing or indentation. An experiment is reported in which three cueing conditions were used to format an index. The independent variables included (1) boldfacing or no boldfacing, (2) bullets or no bullets and (3) <b>interline</b> <b>spacing</b> or no <b>interline</b> <b>spacing.</b> Subjects were {{randomly assigned to one of}} eight conditions and asked to look up words in an index. The dependent variable, time to locate a word, was measured across three types of index headings on five different trial blocks. The index headings included three hierarchical levels: (1) main entries, (2) sub-entries and (3) sub/sub-entries. Results indicated a significant main effect of boldfacing with performance being best in the boldface condition. A significant boldfacing by heading interaction demonstrated that boldfacing significantly improved performance time on sub-entries and sub/sub-entries, but had no effect on main entries. A significant interaction was also found to exist between trial blocks and spacing. The results indicated that spacing had an adverse effect on performance over time, since in the spacing condition performance showed a decrement from trial block 1 to trial block 5 while in the no spacing condition performance improved. It was concluded that typographical cues can enhance performance under certain conditions when using an index. Implications of the findings for index formating, as well as suggestions for future research were stated...|$|E

40|$|Any {{practical}} {{holographic display}} device {{relying on the}} MIT synthetic aperture approach will require timebandwith products far exceeding those available with single channel acousto-optic modulators (AOMs).

It is now technically feasible to accomodate a large number of acoustic channels on a single crystal with a corresponding improvement in image characteristics.

40|$|A general {{phenomenology}} for phase behaviour in {{the mixed}} phase of disordered type-II superconductors is outlined. We {{propose that the}} “Bragg glass ” phase generically transforms via two separate thermodynamic phase transitions into a disordered liquid on increasing the temperature. The first transition is into a glassy phase, topologically disordered at the largest length scales, but lacking the long-ranged phase correlations of a “vortex glass”. This phase has a significant degree of short-ranged translational order, unlike the disordered liquid, but no quasi-long range order, {{in contrast to the}} Bragg glass. This glassy phase, which we call a “multi-domain glass”, is confined to a narrow sliver at intermediate fields, but broadens out both for much larger and much smaller field values. Structure in the multi-domain glass is argued to resemble a disordered arrangement of crystalline domains. Estimates for typical domain sizes indicate that they can be far larger than the <b>interline</b> <b>spacing</b> for weak disorder, suggesting a plausible mechanism by which signals of a two-step transition can be obscured.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a noncontact method for measurement of the interline capacitance in Cu/low-k interconnect. It {{is based on a}} miniature test vehicle with net capacitance of a few femto-Farads formed by two 20 -μ m-long parallel wires (lines) with widths and spacings the same as those of the interconnect wires of interest. Each line is connected to a small test pad. The vehicle impedance is measured at 4 GHz by a near-field microwave probe with 10 μ m probe size via capacitive coupling of the probe to the vehicle's test pads. Full 3 D finite element modeling at 4 GHz confirms that the microwave radiation is concentrated between the two wires forming the vehicle. An analytical lumped element model and a short/open calibration approach have been proposed to extract the interline capacitance value from the measured data. We have validated the technique on several test vehicles made with copper and low-k dielectric on a 300 mm wafer.

40|$|International audiencePURPOSE. To {{describe}} new, efficient {{predictors of}} maximum reading speed (MRS) in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) patients with central field loss. Type of AMD (wet versus dry) was scrutinized, because this factor seems {{to offer a}} promising model of differential visual adaptation induced by different temporal courses of disease progression. METHODS. Linear mixed-effects (LME) analyses were performed on a dataset initially collected to assess the effect of <b>interline</b> <b>spacing</b> on MRS. MRS was measured with MNread-like French sentences in 89 eyes (64 dry and 25 wet) of 61 patients with AMD. Microperimetry examination was performed on each eye. The eyes were included only {{if they had a}} dense macular scotoma including the fovea, to ensure that patients used eccentric viewing. RESULTS. Analyses show the unique contributions-after adjustment for the effects of other factors-of three new factors: (1) MRS was higher for wet than for dry AMD eyes; (2) an advantage of similar amplitude was found for phakic eyes compared with pseudophakic eyes; and (3) MRS decreased when distance between fixation preferred retinal locus (PRL) and fovea increased. In addition, the instantaneous slope of the relationship between scotoma area and MRS was much shallower than reported in two other studies. CONCLUSIONS. The four effects improve the ability to predict MRS reliably for AMD patients. The wet/dry difference is a major finding that may result from the different time courses of the two types of disease, thus involving different types of visuomotor and attentional adaptation processes.
