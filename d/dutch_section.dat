2500|$|After {{training}} in radio communications at Melbourne Technical College, Siffleet volunteered for special operations in September 1942 and was posted to the Services Reconnaissance Department (SRD) of the Allied Intelligence Bureau in Melbourne. He joined Z Special Unit in October and {{was transferred to}} Cairns in Far North Queensland for further operational training. Assigned to the SRD's <b>Dutch</b> <b>section</b> as a radio operator, Siffleet was promoted sergeant in May 1943. He moved across to M Special Unit the same month {{to take part in}} a mission to set up a coastwatching station in the hills behind Hollandia in Papua New Guinea. Described by Commander Eric Feldt, director of the Coastwatchers, as [...] "the best type of N.C.O. of the A.I.F., young and competent", Siffleet joined a party led by Sergeant H. N. Staverman of the Royal Netherlands Navy, which included two Ambonese privates, H. Pattiwal and M. Reharing. Code-named [...] "Whiting", this team was to work in concert with another group known as [...] "Locust", led by Lieutenant Jack Fryer.|$|E

50|$|Similarly, {{disputes}} {{within and}} amongst LabourStart volunteers {{that reflect the}} differing positions of the unions and political factions from which they are drawn are regular occurrences. The Canadian and <b>Dutch</b> <b>sections</b> have, for example, clashed over whether a confessional trade union, one that is explicitly affiliated with an organized religion or church, {{can be considered a}} legitimate trade union. Issues like these are fundamental to what LabourStart does as the question of legitimacy determines whether a trade union is able to access LabourStart's services and whether persons affiliated with it may move into senior leadership positions within LabourStart.|$|R

50|$|In 1962, in {{line with}} {{constitutional}} reforms governing official language use, the French and <b>Dutch</b> <b>sections</b> of the university became autonomous within a common governing structure. Flemish nationalists continued to demand {{a division of the}} university, and Dutch speakers expressed resentment at privileges given to French-speaking academic staff and the perceived disdain by the local French-speaking community for their Dutch-speaking neighbours. At the time, Brussels and Leuven were both part of the officially bilingual and now defunct Province of Brabant; but unlike Brussels, Leuven had retained its Dutch-speaking character. Tensions rose when a French-speaking social geographer suggested in a televised lecture that the city of Leuven should be incorporated into an enlarged bilingual 'Greater-Brussels' region. Mainstream Flemish politicians and students began demonstrating under the slogan 'Leuven Vlaams - Walen Buiten' ("Leuven is Flemish - Walloons out"). Student demonstrations escalated into violence throughout the mid-60s. Student unrest fueled by the history of discrimination against Flemings eventually brought down the Belgian government in February 1968.|$|R

50|$|The BNSM {{was soon}} {{attempting}} to re-activate the old BM membership {{and followed the}} old template of encouraging members to undergo military training through the TA or other means. The BNSM also built up links with the Ulster Defence Association and Ulster Volunteer Force and BNSM members also served with the English companies of these Ulster loyalist paramilitaries. The group, which had about 300 members by 1990, also sought links with European groups and was close to Dutch former SS man Et Wolsink who was variously connected to Dutch Peoples-Union and the <b>Dutch</b> <b>sections</b> of the Wiking-Jugend and the Action Front of National Socialists/National Activists. Links were also built with the white power music scene of Blood and Honour and in particular Ian Stuart Donaldson who, despite his previous membership of the NF, was close Cat Mee, a BM orgnaiser in Derbyshire. Donaldson's attempts to leave the skinhead scene and scale back his involvement in music soured the relationship however and in 1990 links were severed after a group of activists turned up at Donaldson's local pub {{and told him to}} play for them or face assault.|$|R
