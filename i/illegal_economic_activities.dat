40|$|State {{concerns}} about crime and security issues have strongly affected conceptions of economic action outside the law, a traditional {{field of research}} in sociology. This increasing encroachment by policy-related concerns on the intellectual framework of the discipline has led, on one hand, to an almost exclusive focus on criminal organizations in the analyses of <b>illegal</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity.</b> On the other hand, {{it has led to}} the downplaying of the importance of classic topics of sociological reflection, such as the embeddedness of action, the moral dimension of illegal products, or the relationship between social change and the spread of illegal exchanges. This short paper problematizes economic action outside the law by taking legal definitions and their effects seriously. It begins with the problem of naturalizing state definitions. This is followed by a discussion of the illegality of illegal markets, which illustrates sociological contributions. Finally, three dimensions of the study of illegal markets are suggested. Overall, the paper lays out a research program for this field of sociological inquiry. Das staatliche Interesse an Kriminalitäts- und Sicherheitsfragen wirkt sich massiv auf das Verständnis von illegalen ökonomischen Handlungen aus, einem klassischen soziologischen Forschungsgebiet. Der zunehmende Eingriff in die intellektuelle Struktur der Disziplin hat zur Folge, dass der Fokus fast ausschließlich auf die Analyse illegalen Markttauschs gerichtet ist und die Bedeutung klassischer soziologischer Themenfelder – wie die Einbettung wirtschaftlichen Handelns, die moralische Dimension illegaler Güter oder die Verbindung zwischen sozialem Wandel und der Verbreitung illegaler Märkte – heruntergespielt wird.

A rise in currency stocks and payments may be taken as a rough indicator {{of the extent to which}} these transactions may not be reported to government authorities. The paper aims to estimate the size of subterranean economy using the simple currency ratio method of Gutmann for quarterly data covering the period 2000 - 2010. Thus, the study analyzes the ratio of currency to demand deposits in order to estimate the amount of economic activity in the subterranean economy. The empirical results point out that the <b>illegal</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activities</b> are about four billion RON at the middle of 2000; it constitutes 17. 4 percent of the official GNP.

40|$|The {{concept of}} social capital is widely used in the social {{sciences}} today. We risk appearing obvious by affirming that {{the use of the term}} has created a tower of Babel in research programs. This study is based on a basic distinction: it recognizes that there is a difference between understanding human interactions as a resource at the service of individuals and understanding them within a process of collective action. The first perspective follows the altered trail blazed by micro-economics that seeks to re-found social theory on a basis of individual decision theory. In this sense, I assume that there are interdependent individual choices, however, social mediations that facilitate these choices are considered endogenous to the calculation of individual utility. With this explanatory route, cooperation, if it exists, is a collateral effect for the search for individual interest. The second perspective travels along the neo-structural path, inspired by Simmel, which seeks to capture emergent regularities. That is, it is not programmed by individuals, in repeated of interaction. In this sense, and without denying the strategic action of individuals, it assumes that there are exogenous mediations, pre-fixed and not pre-fixed, which help or hinder the joint production of collective goods or services. According to this explanation, cooperation, if it exists, is the result of organizational arrangements that channel the negotiation and conflict of individual interests. With the latter strategy in mind, an analytical table was constructed to understand the constitution of a productive initiative with small palm oil producers. The extreme conditions found in a context of political violence and <b>illegal</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activities</b> allow submitting the conjecture {{of social capital}} to a particular test, understood in a non-instrumental form as the infrastructure of economic production processes. Micro-institutional analysis techniques were combined with social network analysis. It was found that the construction - under the extreme conditions of political violence and <b>illegal</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activities</b> - of a productive arrangement rich in social capital, presupposes that the group implementing the process use a pedagogy that balances input incentives with output costs for the beneficiaries, who depersonalize access to useful information; which considers the spatial proximity of production, homophilic collaboration choices; and the weakness of kinship ties as a mechanism for lateral social controlPARIS-DAUPHINE-BU (751162101) / SudocSudocFranceF...|$|E

5000|$|In Cuba, jineterismo is a {{category}} of <b>illegal</b> or semi-legal <b>economic</b> <b>activities</b> related to tourism in Cuba. It covers {{a broad range of}} activities including prostitution and pimping, as well as other forms of hustling, such as selling black-market and counterfeit goods, providing private taxi services and serving as informal tourist guides. The term can also be applied to those activities of professional white-collar workers that generate income from interaction with peers abroad. The word derives from the Spanish jinete ("horserider"). Jinetear, meaning [...] "to jockey", refers to the competitive act of riding a horse for economic reward. A male practitioner is a jinetero, a female jinetera. The term jineterismo became widely-used in the 1990s as a synonym for prostitution in Cuba, with prostitutes being referred to as jineteras.

40|$|The mainly goal {{of money}} {{laundering}} is {{to carry out}} more and more <b>illegal</b> <b>economic</b> transactions or <b>activities</b> to produce individual or groups gains and then to legitimate them. Money laundering converts illicit source of money generated by criminal activities in order to hide the connection between money and their original illegal activities. This is one of money laundering side. The second side implies corruption. While money laundering is a passing channel for illicit funds due to its criminal origin source, such funds may derive from corruption offences. All corruption’s forms represent the most important illicit funds branches for money laundering process. Corrupt people methods used to exploit the national and international financial system reflect the relationship between those two criminal activities. Criminals achieve their personal interests by hiding their corruption proceeds and transfer these gains to official economies.

The first part argues that rational models can provide significant insights on the emergence and current patterns of terrorism and piracy. These findings could lead to new priorities or to more nuanced interventions in response to these threats. The second part focuses on the direct and indirect costs of both terrorism and organised crime. EUSECON provided new data about the scope of related <b>illegal</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activities</b> and explored the sensitivity of markets, societies and polities in the aftermath of terrorist attacks. It emerges that political actors are at greatest risk of over-responding, whereas mature economies display a high degree of resilience. Finally, the third part discusses economic approaches to policy evaluation. EUSECON clarified the benefits of transnational security cooperation, but also highlights the difficulties of rigorous costeffectiveness and cost-benefit calculations. Therefore, a more evidence-based approach to security policymaking, which is increasingly touted by EU decision-makers, remains elusive. In conclusion, European security policy needs further scrutiny from an economic perspective, in order to answer the increasing complexity of security challenges under the increasing financial or political constraints. ...|$|E

Data and observations indicate that land-poor families forced into swidden farming have greater contact with the primary vectors in Thailand [...] which breed in small pools in forested areas and shady clearings on hilly scrub terrain. Once infected, migrants from an endemic locus can introduce the parasite into an area with no transmission but potent vectors, thus becoming the cause of explosive epidemics; equally, non-immunes carrying out agricultural activities in or across forest and border areas can themselves be subject to seasonal morbidity. In addition to agricultural activities on clearings near forested areas, clandestine forest activities and cross border traffic contributes to the high prevalence of malaria in Thai border villages. <b>Illegal</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activities</b> [...] logging, poaching, cattle and goods smuggling [...] interferes with vector suppression campaigns and prompt detection on infected cases, and ultimately increases human infection not only within the mobile population, but also within the passive population of villages to which the migrants return periodically. Control measures therefore need {{to take into account}} the economic pressures which determine a high degree of mobility, the ethnic diversity of the groups which depend on fringe activities for their economic welfare, and the difficult geography of the areas in which they live.

Increasing {{transfer}} of transactions to electronic space determines the growth of the number of illegal digital operators and promotes consumers’ involvement in digital shadow trade. Scientific literature does not contain any universal definition of digital shadow economy. Hence, the variety of terms, interpretations and features relevant to this phenomenon is rather wide, which determines the necessity to define the precise concept of digital shadow economy {{from the point of view}} of consumers as active participants in this field. This article is aimed at definition of the concept of digital shadow economy from consumers’ position and identification of the measures would discourage potential consumers from participation in digital shadow economy. To increase the size of the survey sample, the method of “snowball” was engaged. The results of the research have revealed that consumers are inclined to distinguish criminal activities (drugs, prostitution, credential steals, etc.) from <b>illegal</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activities,</b> which also violate established legal norms and regulations. The participants of the survey perceive that the activities of digital shadow economy are performed exceptionally in electronic space without official registration of business and evading tax payment. Participation in digital shadow economy is voluntary and mutually beneficial to both transaction parties (a trader and a consumer). With reference to the results of consumers’ evaluation, definition of digital shadow activities as illegal ones, development of the efficient legal framework, containing clearly established criminal and/or administrative responsibility for a consumer as a party of digital shadow transaction, public announcement and availability of the information on illegal e-traders in e-space, availability of appropriate protection software, more intensive supervision and control, establishment of e-police department and assurance of the sufficient number of supervising officers can be considered the most efficient measures of digital shadow economy prevention...|$|E
