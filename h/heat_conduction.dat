Such probes include effects of electric and magnetic fields, measuring response functions, transport properties and thermometry. Commonly used experimental methods include spectroscopy, with probes such as X-rays, infrared light and inelastic neutron scattering; study of thermal response, such as specific heat and measuring transport via thermal and <b>heat</b> <b>conduction.</b>|$|E
5|$|Deep frying (also {{referred}} to as deep fat frying) is a cooking method in which food is submerged in hot fat, most commonly oil, rather than the shallow oil used in conventional frying, done in a frying pan. Normally, a deep fryer or chip pan is used for this; industrially, a pressure fryer or vacuum fryer may be used. Deep frying may also be performed using oil that is heated in a pot. Deep frying is classified as hot-fat cooking method. Typically, deep frying foods cook quickly: all sides of a food are cooked simultaneously as oil has {{a high rate of}} <b>heat</b> <b>conduction.</b>|$|E
40|$|Cluster {{cooling flow}} models that include both AGN <b>heating</b> and thermal <b>conduction</b> have lower overall mass cooling rates and {{simultaneously}} sustain density and temperature profiles {{similar to those}} observed. These computed flows have no ad hoc mass dropout. To achieve this agreement, the thermal conductivity must be about 0. 35 ± 0. 10 of the Spitzer value, similar to that advocated by Narayan & Medvedev. However, when applied to galaxy/group scales the synergistic combination of AGN <b>heating</b> and <b>conduction</b> is less satisfactory. When the computed density profile and the global cooling rate are lowered by AGN heating to match observations of these smaller scale flows, the gas temperatures within ∼ 10 kpc are too large. In addition, best-fitting flows in galaxy/groups with AGN <b>heating</b> and thermal <b>conduction</b> require conductivities {{much closer to the}} Spitzer value ∼ 0. 5 − 1. Another difficulty with galaxy/group flows that combine AGN <b>heating</b> and <b>conduction</b> is that the iron enrichment by Type Ia supernovae is more effective when the gas density is lowered by heating to match the observations. The hot gas iron abundance in galactic flows with <b>heating</b> and <b>conduction</b> greatly exceeds observed values throughout most of the galaxy. Galactic/group flows with central <b>heating</b> and <b>conduction</b> therefore require an additional process that removes the iron: failure of Type Ia ejecta to go into the hot phase, selective cooling, etc...|$|R

5|$|The thermal {{conductivity}} of heliumII {{is greater than}} that of any other known substance, a million times that of heliumI and several hundred times that of copper. This is because <b>heat</b> <b>conduction</b> occurs by an exceptional quantum mechanism. Most materials that conduct heat well have a valence band of free electrons which serve to transfer the heat. HeliumII has no such valence band but nevertheless conducts heat well. The flow of heat is governed by equations that are similar to the wave equation used to characterize sound propagation in air. When heat is introduced, it moves at 20 meters per second at 1.8K through heliumII as waves in a phenomenon known as second sound.|$|E

The thermal conductivity of thin gas layer is reduced significantly with the decreased thickness of gas layer. We examined a few possible causes including the rarefied gas effect and the thermal inertia effect. Our careful simulations indicate that the temperature jump on wall surfaces and the properties changing significantly by the confined space are two dominating factors to the thermal conductivity reduction of thin gas layers...|$|R
