25|$|Linda's {{father came}} from a {{pioneering}} Arizona ranching family and was of German, English, and Mexican ancestry. The family's influence on and contributions to Arizona's history, including wagon making, commerce, pharmacies, and music, are chronicled {{in the library of}} the University of Arizona. Linda Ronstadt's great-grandfather, <b>graduate</b> <b>engineer</b> Friedrich August Ronstadt (who went by Federico Augusto Ronstadt) immigrated to the Southwest (then a part of Mexico) in the 1840s from Hanover, Germany, and married a Mexican citizen, eventually settling in Tucson. In 1991, the City of Tucson opened its central transit terminal on March 16 and dedicated it to Linda's grandfather, Federico José María Ronstadt, a local pioneer businessman; he was a wagon maker whose early contribution to the city's mobility included six mule-drawn streetcars delivered in 190304.|$|E

500|$|Hubbard studied civil {{engineering}} during his {{two years at}} George Washington University {{at the behest of}} his father, who [...] "decreed that I should study engineering and mathematics". While he did not graduate from George Washington, his time there subsequently became important because, as George Malko puts it, [...] "many of his researches and published conclusions have been supported by his claims to be not only a <b>graduate</b> <b>engineer,</b> but 'a member of the first United States course in formal education in what is called today nuclear physics.'" [...] However, a Church of Scientology biography describes him as [...] "never noted for being in class" [...] and says that he [...] "thoroughly detest his subjects". He earned poor grades, was placed on probation in September 1931 and dropped out altogether in the fall of 1932.|$|E

2500|$|The 1913 six-cylinder {{models were}} the first cars to employ the {{important}} advancement of monobloc engine casting which became associated with a production-economy drive in {{the years of the}} war. At that time, a 28-year-old university <b>graduate</b> <b>engineer,</b> Fred M. Zeder, was appointed chief engineer. He was the first of a trio of brilliant technicians, with Owen R. Skelton and Carl Breer, who launched the successful 1918 models, and were known as [...] "The Three Musketeers". They left in 1920 to form a consultancy, later to become the nucleus of Chrysler Engineering. The replacement chief engineer was Guy P. Henry, who introduced molybdenum steel, an improved clutch design, and presided over the six-cylinders-only policy favored by new president Albert Russel Erskine who replaced Fred Fish in July 1915.|$|E

40|$|<b>Graduate</b> <b>engineers</b> {{are often}} thrown {{in at the}} deep end when they start {{a career in the}} {{construction}} industry and they may be expected to manage a team of workers almost from the day they start. This could be a problem {{because of a lack of}} management education in their undergraduate degrees, compounded by the fact that there are few structured development programmes they can follow. In many cases, engineers from a mostly technical background are promoted into project management positions without any formal development or structured training in team or project management. One of the biggest effects of this is the poor management of construction projects. The study aimed to establish the most relevant project management competencies that <b>graduate</b> <b>engineers</b> in the construction industry need to be exposed to prior to leading large sections on a construction site. This aim was met by interviewing seven <b>graduate</b> <b>engineers</b> within two years after joining the construction industry, two human resources senior managers, and eight senior project managers, directors and managing directors of a large South African-based construction company. The data from the interviews were combined with data from a literature review to design questionnaires, which were distributed, and more data were obtained from 29 <b>graduate</b> <b>engineers,</b> 16 human resources professionals, and 42 senior project managers, directors and managing directors. The study identified seven competencies deemed the most important ones to be developed in <b>graduate</b> <b>engineers</b> – no significant difference in opinion on these competencies were found between the various respondent groups. The study also identified six methods that would be well suited to develop these, but found a significant difference in the opinions of the different respondent groups on which methods would be best suited. It seems that one of the main differences between the views held by the <b>graduate</b> <b>engineers</b> and those held by the more senior personnel is their opinion about physically working on a construction site and gaining experience in that way, as opposed to receiving formal training early on in their careers.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} on-going work {{investigating the}} experiences and perceptions of under-graduate engineering students with aspirations to work in construction engineering in site and project management roles. Construction companies employ many <b>graduate</b> Civil <b>Engineers</b> from Australian universities {{in a range of}} construction engineering roles. However, it appears that <b>graduating</b> <b>engineers</b> may have few ideas of the workings of engineering industry, professional roles they will be expected to play and the career options available to them. There is also some evidence to suggest that employers also find this lack 2 ̆ 7 work readiness 2 ̆ 7 in new recruits perplexing. In the transition to professional practice, employers and new graduates have found a need for a very steep leaning curve to equip newly <b>graduating</b> <b>engineers</b> with the necessary work skills to adapt their engineering degree education to the 2 ̆ 7 real world 2 ̆ 7. This paper describes some on going research into the issue and outlines and examines {{some of the issues that}} are routinely faced by newly <b>graduating</b> <b>engineers</b> in their transition to professional practice.
