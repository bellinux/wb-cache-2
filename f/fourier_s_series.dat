50|$|The SA {{series is}} a {{different}} variant of the <b>S</b> <b>series.</b> Its S-based body has a flat back and an arched top, {{as opposed to the}} carved top and back of the normal <b>S</b> <b>series.</b> It also utilizes the SAT single-locking floating tremolo that only locks at the bridge, as opposed to the ZR and Edge tremolos, with which normal <b>S</b> <b>series</b> guitars are equipped. Prior to 2008 series, SA is the only standard (non-budget) range of solid-body guitar that use non-locking tremolos.|$|R

It operates at a maximum speed of 64 MHz and features up to 256 Kbytes of Flash and up to 48 Kbytes of SRAM. The peripheral set includes a Full Speed USB Device port with embedded transceiver, a High Speed MCI for SDIO/SD/MMC, an External Bus Interface featuring a Static Memory Controller providing connection to SRAM, PSRAM, NOR Flash, LCD Module and NAND Flash, 2 x USARTs, 2 x UARTs, 2 x TWIs, 3 x SPI, an I 2 S, as well as 1 PWM timer, 6 x general-purpose 16 -bit timers, an RTC, an ADC, a 12 -bit DAC and an analog comparator. The SAM 3 <b>S</b> <b>series</b> is ready for capacitive touch thanks to the QTouch library, offering an easy way to implement buttons, wheels and sliders The SAM 3 S device is a medium range general purpose microcontroller with the best ratio in terms of reduced power consumption, processing power and peripheral set. This enables the SAM 3 S to sustain a wide range of applications including consumer, industrial control, and PC peripherals. It operates from 1. 62 V to 3. 6 V and is available in 48 -, 64 - and 100 -pin QFP, 48 - and 64 -pin QFN, and 100 -pin BGA packages. The SAM 3 <b>S</b> <b>series</b> is the ideal migration path from the SAM 7 <b>S</b> <b>series</b> for applications that require more performance. The SAM 3 <b>S</b> <b>series</b> is pin-to-pin compatible with the SAM 7 <b>S</b> <b>series.</b> This is a summary document.

25|$|The <b>S</b> <b>series</b> was {{assigned}} to the Straits Settlement of Singapore, which continuously used the basic S #### format for several decades until the format was nearly exhausted and subsequently expanded to Sx #### after rationalisation in 1948. Following Singapore's expulsion from Malaysia in 1965, the <b>S</b> <b>series</b> is no longer administered by the Malaysian Road Transport Department, and fell under the responsibility of the State of Singapore Registry of Vehicles and its successor, the Land Transport Authority; vehicles with Singaporean S plates that were under Malaysian ownership were reissued with corresponding Malaysian number plates. In the years following expulsion, the Singaporean number plate system evolved independently with changing prefix systems since 1972, culminating to the reintroduction of the <b>S</b> <b>series</b> for private cars in 1984, the inclusion of a fourth checksum letter, and varied colour schemes for different classes of vehicles.|$|R

The ZR tremolo system uses ball-bearings as opposed to knife edges for pivot points and a built-in counter-tension system called the Zero Point System.
