5|$|Drilling at low speed: The pilot <b>hole</b> <b>is</b> {{expanded}} by using progressively wider drills (typically {{between three and}} seven successive drilling steps, depending on implant width and length). Care is taken not to damage the osteoblast or bone cells by overheating. A cooling saline or water spray keeps the temperature low.|$|E
5|$|A black <b>hole</b> <b>is</b> {{a region}} of spacetime exhibiting such strong {{gravitational}} effects that nothing—not even particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light—can escape from inside it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon. Although the event horizon has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, no locally detectable features appear to be observed. In many ways a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.|$|E
30|$|If {{these two}} planned burr <b>holes</b> <b>are</b> close, a single more {{anteriorly}} located (1.5 – 1.7  cm) precoronal burr <b>hole</b> <b>was</b> performed (17 patients). If these two planned burr <b>holes</b> <b>are</b> away enough, then two separate burr <b>holes</b> <b>are</b> necessary where an additional burr-hole located {{close to the}} hair line (3 – 5  cm from coronal suture) was dedicated for biopsy (eight patients).|$|R
50|$|Through 1994, the 9th <b>hole</b> <b>was</b> a par 5; before 1962, the 1st <b>hole</b> <b>was</b> also a par 5.|$|R
50|$|The {{peninsula}} <b>holes</b> <b>were</b> {{damaged by}} storms in 2013 damaging {{almost all the}} greens with salt water. The peninsula <b>holes</b> <b>were</b> closed for almost 18 months while the <b>holes</b> <b>were</b> redeveloped. This left nine new peninsula holes and a further two nine <b>hole</b> loops which <b>was</b> reopened in April 2015. The course now has 27 holes.|$|R
5|$|A {{fusible plug}} is a {{threaded}} metal cylinder usually of bronze, brass or gunmetal, with a tapered hole drilled completely through its length. This <b>hole</b> <b>is</b> sealed {{with a metal}} {{of low melting point}} that flows away if a pre-determined, high temperature is reached. The initial use of the fusible plug was as a safety precaution against low water levels in steam engine boilers, but later applications extended its use to other closed vessels, such as air conditioning systems and tanks for transporting corrosive or liquefied petroleum gasses.|$|E
5|$|An {{attempt to}} open a sealed chamber using a Borazon drill fails to make progress. However, a few moments after the drill is stopped, a small <b>hole</b> <b>is</b> seen, though the drill operator, Sladden (Duncan Lamont), is certain it was not created by his machine. The hole widens to reveal the corpses of three-legged, insectoid creatures with horned heads. Roney and Judd work to {{preserve}} the bodies before they decay. An examination of the creatures' physiology suggests {{they came from the}} planet Mars. Quatermass and Roney note the similarity between the appearance of the creatures and images of the Devil.|$|E
5|$|Leonard's Bakery is a Portuguese bakery in Honolulu, Hawaii, {{known for}} popularizing the malasada. The fried pastry, {{slightly}} crispier and chewier than a doughnut {{and with no}} <b>hole,</b> <b>is</b> known as a cuisine of Hawaii. Though Portuguese immigrants brought the malasada to Hawaii {{at the turn of}} the 20th century, Leonard's opened in 1952 and brought it to a wider audience. Leonard's is a household name in Hawaii and is well known in the continental United States and internationally. A franchise location opened in Japan in 2008.|$|E

25|$|Polyominoes with <b>holes</b> <b>are</b> {{inconvenient}} {{for some}} purposes, such as tiling problems. In some contexts polyominoes with <b>holes</b> <b>are</b> excluded, allowing only simply connected polyominoes.|$|R
50|$|The {{municipality}} of <b>Hole</b> <b>was</b> established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The annex of Tyristrand <b>was</b> separated from <b>Hole</b> on 1 July 1916 {{to become a}} {{municipality of}} its own. The municipality of <b>Hole</b> <b>was</b> merged into the neighboring municipality of Ringerike in 1964, however, this merger ended in 1977 when <b>Hole</b> <b>was</b> restored as a separate municipality.|$|R
5|$|Shortly after birth, Bertram {{declares}} {{war with}} Stewie for {{control over the}} playground. They confront {{each other in the}} playground with F-117 Nighthawks and AH-1 Cobras, firing numerous bullets at each other. After the air battle ends with no winners, Bertram resorts to biological warfare, and infects Stewie with chickenpox. After recovering, an enraged Stewie confronts Bertram, and they engage in a sword fight in the play area. Stewie eventually wins by disarming Bertram, and later that night, is seen suspiciously digging a hole with Christopher Moltisanti, but the <b>hole</b> <b>is</b> actually for a young tree. Stewie explains to Christopher that Bertram admitted defeat to Stewie and ran away.|$|E
5|$|Songs {{from the}} Black <b>Hole</b> <b>is</b> an unfinished, {{unreleased}} album by the American alternative rock band Weezer recorded between 1994 and 1996. Intended {{to follow their}} 1994 self-titled debut album, {{it was to be}} a science fiction rock opera that expressed songwriter Rivers Cuomo's mixed feelings about rock and roll success. Its six characters were to be voiced by Cuomo, guitarist Brian Bell and bassist Matt Sharp of Weezer, Rachel Haden of That Dog and the Rentals, Joan Wasser of the Dambuilders, and Weezer collaborator Karl Koch.|$|E
5|$|The amputated parts {{might be}} placed in a pouch for the girl to wear. A single hole of 2–3mm is left for the passage of urine and menstrual fluid. The vulva is closed with {{surgical}} thread, or agave or acacia thorns, and might be covered with a poultice of raw egg, herbs and sugar. To help the tissue bond, the girl's legs are tied together, often from hip to ankle; the bindings are usually loosened after a week and removed after two to six weeks. If the remaining <b>hole</b> <b>is</b> too large {{in the view of the}} girl's family, the procedure is repeated.|$|E
50|$|In 1963, a third {{stretch of}} 9 <b>holes</b> <b>was</b> added. The land which {{originally}} housed the additional 9 <b>holes</b> <b>is</b> {{now home to}} ConnectWise and Labtech Software.|$|R
50|$|The ISO {{standard}} two <b>holes</b> <b>are</b> 80 mm apart, {{according to}} ISO 838. The four-hole version has no ISO standard. The distances between <b>holes</b> <b>are</b> 80 mm (3×8).|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} six shallow temperature-gradient <b>holes</b> <b>were</b> drilled for Sunoco Energy Development Company in Panther Canyon, Pershing County, Nevada {{during the period}} March 24 through June 15, 1981. A {{proposed}} intermediate-depth gradient <b>hole</b> <b>was</b> spud but abandoned after encountering unresolvable drilling problems. The locations of these <b>holes</b> <b>are</b> shown on figure 1. This report summarizes {{the results of the}} Panther Canyon project...|$|R
5|$|The {{preferred}} {{habitat is}} mature deciduous or mixed woodland with large, old trees, preferably oak. Pairs hold permanent territories, and nest in tree holes, usually old woodpecker nests, but sometimes natural cavities. If {{the entrance to}} the <b>hole</b> <b>is</b> too large, the female plasters it with mud to reduce its size, and often coats the inside of the cavity too. The 6–9 red-speckled white eggs are laid on a deep base of pine or other wood chips.|$|E
5|$|Typically {{carried out}} by a {{traditional}} circumciser using a blade, FGM is conducted from days after birth to puberty and beyond. In half the countries for which national figures are available, most girls are cut {{before the age of}} five. Procedures differ according to the country or ethnic group. They include removal of the clitoral hood and clitoral glans; removal of the inner labia; and removal of the inner and outer labia and closure of the vulva. In this last procedure, known as infibulation, a small <b>hole</b> <b>is</b> left for the passage of urine and menstrual fluid; the vagina is opened for intercourse and opened further for childbirth.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Variscan mountain-building, the Mendip area now {{comprises}} at least four anticlinal fold structures, with an east-west trend, each with a core of older Devonian sandstone and Silurian volcanic rocks. The latter are quarried for use in road construction and as a concrete aggregate. The Mendips were considerably higher and steeper 200 to 300million years ago, and subsequent erosion has resulted in a range of surface features including gorges, dry valleys, screes, swallets and others typical of karst landscapes. These are complemented underground by a large number of caves both beneath the plateau and {{at the base of the}} southern escarpment. Wookey <b>Hole</b> <b>is</b> one example of the caves of the area. There are also areas of limestone pavement and other karst features. Dissolution of the limestone produced many of the gorges including Cheddar Gorge and Burrington Combe. Springs are a common feature of the eastern part of the hills, a number of which have associated tufa deposits.|$|E
50|$|When {{existing}} <b>holes</b> <b>are</b> to be enlarged or reshaped by EDM, through <b>holes</b> <b>are</b> {{preferred to}} blind holes as they permit easier flow of dielectric fluid past the area being machined.|$|R
50|$|In supersymmetric theories, extremal black <b>holes</b> <b>are</b> often supersymmetric: {{they are}} {{invariant}} under several supercharges. This {{is a consequence}} of the BPS bound. Such black <b>holes</b> <b>are</b> stable and emit no Hawking radiation. Their black <b>hole</b> entropy can <b>be</b> calculated in string theory.|$|R
50|$|As a three-player variant, {{the first}} 15 <b>holes</b> <b>are</b> {{played with the}} {{rotating}} dingo going alone against the opposing pair. The last three <b>holes</b> <b>are</b> played individually, and scored as detailed above.|$|R
5|$|Ballard's {{survey found}} no {{underwater}} penetrations of the ship's fully armoured citadel. Eight holes {{were found in}} the hull, one on the starboard side and seven on the port side, all above the waterline. One of the holes is in the deck, on the bow's starboard side. The angle and shape indicates the shell that created the hole was fired from Bismarcks port side and struck the starboard anchor chain. The anchor chain has disappeared down this hole. Six holes are amidships, three shell fragments pierced the upper splinter belt, and one made a hole in the main armour belt. Further aft a huge <b>hole</b> <b>is</b> visible, parallel to the aircraft catapult, on the deck. The submersibles recorded no sign of a shell penetration through the main or side armour here, and {{it is likely that the}} shell penetrated the deck armour only. Huge dents showed that many of the 14inch shells fired by King George V bounced off the German belt armour.|$|E
5|$|Later, in 1993, Gerard 't Hooft wrote a {{speculative}} {{paper on}} quantum gravity {{in which he}} revisited Hawking's work on black hole thermodynamics, concluding that {{the total number of}} degrees of freedom in a region of spacetime surrounding a black <b>hole</b> <b>is</b> proportional to the surface area of the horizon. This idea was promoted by Leonard Susskind and is now known as the holographic principle. The holographic principle and its realization in string theory through the AdS/CFT correspondence have helped elucidate the mysteries of black holes suggested by Hawking's work and are believed to provide a resolution of the black hole information paradox. In 2004, Hawking conceded that black holes do not violate quantum mechanics, and he suggested a concrete mechanism by which they might preserve information.|$|E
5|$|Nests {{built in}} the open are large and untidy domed structures, built of dry grass, twigs, and other plant {{material}}s. Any leaves or thorns present in a tree may be worked into the nest. In cavity nests, the <b>hole</b> <b>is</b> filled with a shapeless mass of grass {{with a cup of}} soft material containing the eggs on the inside. When the disused domed nests of weavers are used, they are simply given a soft lining. The nest entrance is on the side, and is sometimes extended into a short funnel. The male and the female construct the nest together, keeping close when finding material and weaving it together. The inside linings of Cape sparrow nests can incorporate large portions of aromatic leaves such as wolbossie (Helichrysum pumilio), thyme (Thymus vulgaris), and camphor (Cinnamomum). This consistent use of aromatics suggests that they have some purpose such as protection against parasites.|$|E

50|$|Because {{the finger}} <b>holes</b> <b>are</b> not covered with keys, {{some of the}} tone <b>holes</b> <b>are</b> placed in acoustically {{unfavorable}} locations to accommodate the hand. The relatively large finger-span distance reduces fluency of playing.|$|R

5|$|The fixed {{reed and}} fairly uniform {{diameter}} of the clarinet give the instrument an acoustical behavior approximating that of a cylindrical stopped pipe. Recorders use a tapered internal bore to overblow at the octave when the thumb/register <b>hole</b> <b>is</b> pinched open, while the clarinet, with its cylindrical bore, overblows at the 12th. Adjusting {{the angle of the}} bore taper controls the frequencies of the overblown notes (harmonics). Changing the mouthpiece's tip opening and the length of the reed changes aspects of the harmonic timbre or voice of the clarinet because this changes the speed of reed vibrations. Generally, the goal of the clarinetist when producing a sound is to make as much of the reed vibrate as possible, making the sound fuller, warmer, and potentially louder.|$|E
5|$|IM Normae {{is one of}} {{only ten}} {{recurrent}} novae known in the Milky Way. It has erupted in 1920 and 2002, reaching magnitude 8.5 from a baseline of 18.3. It was poorly monitored after the first eruption, so it is possible that it erupted in between. Norma hosts two faint R Coronae Borealis variable stars of magnitude 10—RT Normae and RZ Normae—rare degenerate stars thought to have formed from the merger of two white dwarfs that fade by several magnitudes periodically as they eject large amounts of carbon dust. A faint object of magnitude 16, QV Normae is a high mass X-ray binary star system 15,000–20,000 light-years distant from Earth. It is composed of a neutron star orbiting a blue-white supergiant approximately 20times as massive as the Sun. The stellar wind from the more massive star is drawn to the magnetic poles of the neutron star, forming an accretion column and producing X-rays. Located 19,000 light-years away, QX Normae is an active low mass X ray binary composed of a neutron star and its companion star that is smaller and cooler than the Sun. The neutron star is 1.74 ± 0.14 times as massive as the Sun, yet its radius is a mere 9.3 ± 1.0km. 1E161348-5055 is a neutron star found in the centre of RCW103 supernova remnant. A periodic X-Ray source with a period of 6.67hours, it is approximately 2000 years old and 10,000 light-years away from Earth. It is unusual in that it is spinning much too slowly for its young age, behaving instead like a multi-million-year-old star. SGR J1550-5418 is a soft gamma repeater (SGR)—a magnetar that is emitting gamma ray flares, located some 30,000 light-years distant from Earth. The rotation period, of approximately 2.07 seconds, is the fastest yet observed for a magnetar. XTE J1550-564 is another X-ray binary, this time composed of a large black hole around 10 times as massive as the Sun and a cool orange donor star. The black <b>hole</b> <b>is</b> a microquasar, firing off jets of material most likely from its accretion disk.|$|E
5|$|The interclavicle is a {{large plate}} with a smooth upper surface and a {{prominent}} groove on the bottom surface. It also bears a small, pointed projection at its back end. The scapulae have prominent shelves on each side (diagnostic of leptocleidids and polycotylids, but not strongly differentiated in elasmosaurids), and their glenoids are clearly concave, with roughened attachments for cartilage. The two coracoids curve outwards {{in the middle and}} contact at their ends, forming a hole in the middle, although the exact morphology of this <b>hole</b> <b>is</b> uncertain. The regions where the coracoids contact is vaulted and thickened to form a weak, ridge-like projection, comparable to but probably convergently acquired from elasmosaurids. The pubes form a somewhat rectangular dish, with a convex front edge and concave outer edge, while the ischia are flat, triangular, and plate-like. The edges of the pubes where they meet the ischia curve inwards from the midline to each side. The corresponding edges of the ischia are similarly-shaped, with the curved edges of the bones collectively forming two rounded fenestrae that are connected in the center by a small rhombus-shaped opening, as also seen in Futabasaurus. The ilia are rod-shaped and bent, with blunt projections halfway along their outer rims; at the top end, they are flattened into a fan-like shape.|$|E
30|$|The {{nanosized}} <b>hole</b> <b>was</b> {{analyzed by}} Cs-corrected TEM (Libra 200 HT Mc, Carl Zeiss).

25|$|The modern view {{of black}} <b>hole</b> {{irreversibility}} <b>is</b> to relate {{it to the}} second law of thermodynamics, since black <b>holes</b> <b>are</b> viewed as thermodynamic objects.
