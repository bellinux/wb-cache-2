5|$|The Uniform State Narcotic Drug Act, first {{tentative}} {{draft in}} 1925 and fifth final version in 1932, {{was a result}} of work by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws. It was argued that the traffic in narcotic drugs should have the same safeguards and the same regulation in all of the states. The committee took into consideration the fact that the federal government had already passed the Harrison Act in 1914 and the Federal Import and Export Act in 1922. Many people assumed that the Harrison Act was all that was necessary. The Harrison Act, however, was a revenue-producing act and, while it provided penalties for violation, it did not give the states themselves authority to exercise police power <b>in</b> <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> seizure of drugs used in illicit trade, or <b>in</b> <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> punishment of those responsible. The act was recommended to the states for that purpose. As a result of the Uniform State Narcotic Act, the Federal Bureau of Narcotics encouraged state governments to adopt the act. By the middle of the 1930s all member states had some regulation of cannabis.|$|E
