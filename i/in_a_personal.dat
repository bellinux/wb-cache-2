5|$|Following {{the death}} of Elizabeth I in 1603, the throne of England was {{inherited}} by the Scottish House of Stuart, resulting in the Union of the Crowns: the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland were united <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> union under James VI and I. As a consequence, the Royal Arms of England and Scotland were combined in the king's new personal arms. Nevertheless, although referencing the personal union with Scotland and Ireland, the Royal Arms of England remained distinct from the Royal Arms of Scotland, until the two realms were joined in a political union in 1707, leading to a unified Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Mountbatten {{stressed}} {{that he would}} act as the trustee of the princes' commitment, as he would be serving as India's head of state well into 1948. He engaged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> dialogue with reluctant princes, such as the Nawab of Bhopal, who he asked through a confidential letter to sign the Instrument of Accession making Bhopal part of India, which Mountbatten would keep locked up in his safe. It would be handed to the States Department on 15 August only if the Nawab did not change his mind before then, which {{he was free to}} do. The Nawab agreed, and did not renege over the deal.|$|E

During the following century, the country experienced an impressive growth in wealth and population, resulting in a need for new infrastructure and buildings.|$|E

5|$|The region {{continued}} to be contested throughout the High Middle Ages as the Republic of Venice started to expand its influence and territory, gradually pushing back Croatia, which had been <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> union of Croatia and Hungary since 1102. By 1420, Venice controlled Istria and Dalmatia, {{as well as all}} the Kvarner Gulf islands except Krk. The island became a part of the realm in 1481, but Venice never captured the region's mainland, which would have entirely linked Venetian possessions in the eastern Adriatic.|$|E
5|$|In 1897 Max Weber Sr. {{died two}} months after a severe quarrel with his son that was never resolved. After this, Weber became {{increasingly}} prone to depression, nervousness and insomnia, {{making it difficult for}} him to fulfill his duties as a professor. His condition forced him to reduce his teaching and eventually leave his course unfinished in the autumn of 1899. After spending months in a sanatorium during the summer and autumn of 1900, Weber and his wife travelled to Italy {{at the end of the}} year and did not return to Heidelberg until April 1902. He would again withdraw from teaching in 1903 and not return to it till 1919. Weber's ordeal with mental illness was carefully described <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> chronology that was destroyed by his wife. This chronicle was supposedly destroyed because Marianne Weber feared that Max Weber's work would be discredited by the Nazis if his experience with mental illness were widely known.|$|E
5|$|Kerry {{found more}} {{success in the}} 100m backstroke, winning his heat in 57.99s to qualify third fastest for the {{semifinal}}s. He then scraped into the final as the second slowest qualifier, after coming fourth in his semifinal {{in a time of}} 58.04s. His time of 57.94s placed him seventh in the final, ahead of fellow Australian Mark Tonelli, but more than two seconds behind the victorious John Naber of the United States. In the 200m event, Kerry put <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> best time of 2m 3.58s in the first heat to qualify fourth fastest for the final, but swam slower in the decider to finish fifth in a time of 2m 4.07s, one place behind Tonelli and 2.72s away from bronze. Kerry combined with Paul Jarvie, Neil Rogers and Peter Coughlan in the 4100m medley relay, placing sixth. The quartet qualified in sixth place, and Kerry had them in fourth place after posting a time of 57.94s in the first leg, but his teammates were unable {{to keep up with the}} leaders and finished more than four seconds out of medal contention.|$|E

5|$|Mr. Connors {{is fired}} by the school board due to the {{violence}} associated with wrestling, after the board fails {{to make a distinction}} between what he teaches and professional wrestling (as do the town bar regulars). They also find videos of Greco-Roman and freestyle wrestling on his iPhone and mistake them for gay pornography. The boys are excited to learn WWE Chairman Vince McMahon has heard of their federation and will be scouting one of their shows. Mr. Connors sits in his apartment surrounded by awards for wrestling and in tears over his termination and what wrestling has become. Vengeful, he plans to sabotage the event <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> vow to restore the integrity of the wrestling sport. Cartman, Stan, Kyle and Kenny secretly decide to relegate Butters, Jimmy and Token to smaller roles, thinking that it will give themselves a better opportunity to impress McMahon. They hold tryouts {{in the manner of a}} theater audition in order to find new talent for their show, which is now more reminiscent of musical theatre than wrestling.|$|E
5|$|The action brought repercussions for Smith, whose {{failure to}} support Osborne was noted; {{although}} Smith {{claimed that he}} was simply maintaining the line of battle, it subsequently emerged that the captains had engaged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> dispute resulting in Smith deciding to refuse Osborne's orders. After his behaviour had featured in Osborne's initial dispatch, Smith challenged his account and Osborne demanded a court-martial held to investigate. This panel decided that Smith's behaviour was unacceptable and he was dismissed from the Navy, by which time he had lost Diomede, wrecked on a rock in Trincomalee Bay on 2 August 1795 during the invasion of Ceylon. Although Smith appealed his sentence and was restored to the captain's list in 1798 he was never again called to service and retired in 1806.|$|E
5|$|The {{defense of}} the city did not {{collapse}} immediately. The Jin held out for months before the city fell. The Jurchen emperor was afforded the opportunity to escape in late 1232, and departed with a retinue of court officials. He left the governance {{of the city to}} the General Cui Li and moved to the city of Guide in Henan on February26, 1233, then Caizhou on August 3. The retreat of the emperor was ruinous to the morale of the soldiers defending the city. In the wake of the emperor's departure, Cui ordered the execution of those loyal to the emperor who had remained in the city. He realized that prolonging the siege was suicidal, and offered to surrender to the Mongols. Cui opened the gates of Kaifeng and the Mongols were let into the city. He was later killed outside of battle <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> dispute, for insulting the wife of someone under his command.|$|E

5|$|This was {{the start}} of a push for Hardy, and at Survivor Series, Hardy and Triple H were the last two {{standing}} to win the traditional elimination match. Hardy began an on and off tag team with Triple H, which eventually led to a respectful feud between the two. The rivalry continued at Armageddon, when Hardy defeated Triple H to become the number one contender for the WWE Championship. In {{the weeks leading up to}} the Royal Rumble, Hardy and Randy Orton engaged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> feud, which began when Orton kicked Hardy's brother, Matt, in the head in the storyline. Hardy, in retaliation, performed a Swanton Bomb on Orton from the top of the Raw set and seemed to have all the momentum after coming out on top in their encounters. Hardy, however, lost the title match at the Royal Rumble, but was named as one of six men to compete in an Elimination Chamber match at No Way Out, where he survived to the final two before being eliminated by the eventual winner, Triple H.|$|E
5|$|The first {{trading post}} {{at the site of}} the Port of Split was Aspalathos, {{established}} by Greek settlers from the island of Vis in the 4th century BC. Position of the trading post was selected because of its location in a natural harbor and its proximity to numerous Adriatic Sea islands and extensive hinterland populated by Illyrians, most notably in Salona. The area subsequently became a part of the Roman Empire, and after its Decline of the Roman Empire, the coast was brought under rule of the Byzantine Empire, until the area was absorbed into the Kingdom of Croatia in the beginning of the 10th century. In 1102, Croatia and Kingdom of Hungary were joined <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> union. By the 12th century, Split had developed trading routes with its hinterland and maritime trade throughout the Adriatic Sea and the Mediterranean. The Republic of Venice of gained full control of Dalmatia and the city of Split by 1428. In the 16th century, Split was the central maritime trade outlet of the Balkans, where goods were transported from the Ottoman Empire, India and Persia to the Venetian Republic and vice versa. After the fall of Venice, Split was briefly ruled by the Habsburg Monarchy and Austrian Empire between 1797 and 1806, and the First French Empire until 1813 when Austrian rule was restored. In that period, trade routes shifted to other Adriatic ports, especially the Port of Rijeka, causing a downturn in the city's economy.|$|E
5|$|With Klim {{recently}} {{returning from}} a two-year injury layoff, and Callus ill, Thorpe could only anchor Australia to sixth in the 4×100m freestyle relay. The 200m began with van den Hoogenband again attacking immediately, reaching the 100m mark more than a second under the world record split, with Thorpe half a body length behind. Thorpe gradually reduced the lead before passing van den Hoogenband in the last 50m to win The Race of the Century by half a body length, in a new Olympic record of 1min 44.71s. Having achieved what had eluded him four years earlier, Thorpe reacted emotionally, immediately tearing off his cap, punching the air and screaming. The next day saw six years of Australian victory in the 4×200m freestyle relay ended when Hackett, Klim and Sprenger had put Thorpe into the final leg 1.48s behind Keller. Thorpe gradually reduced the margin {{but was unable to}} pass Keller in the last lap, the United States touching 0.13s earlier. Thorpe found himself {{on the other side of}} a close result when he qualified last for the 100m freestyle by 0.01s. He capitalised in the final by coming from sixth at the 50m mark to win bronze medal <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>personal</b> best of 48.56s, making him the only person to medal in the 100–200–400 combination in Olympic history. After the Athens Olympics, Thorpe took a break from competitive swimming, skipping the 2005 World Aquatics Championships.|$|E
