5|$|In {{the early}} years of the 20th century, it covered the {{entertainment}} industry, such as circuses, <b>fairs,</b> <b>and</b> burlesque shows. It also created a mail service for travelling entertainers. Billboard began focusing more on the music industry as the jukebox, phonograph, and radio became commonplace. Many topics it covered were spun-off into different magazines, including Amusement Business in 1961 to cover outdoor entertainment, so that it could focus on music. After Donaldson died in 1925, Billboard was passed down to his children and Hennegan's children, until it was sold to private investors in 1985, and has since been owned by various parties.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} surviving Welsh plays are two medieval miracle plays, Y Tri Brenin o Gwlen ("The three Kings from Cologne") and Y Dioddefaint a'r Atgyfodiad ("The Passion and the Resurrection"). A recognised Welsh {{tradition of}} theatre {{emerged during the}} 18th century, {{in the form of}} an interlude, a metrical play performed at <b>fairs</b> <b>and</b> markets. The larger Welsh towns began building theatres during the 19th century, and attracted the likes of James Sheridan Knowles and William Charles Macready to Wales. Along with the playhouses, there existed mobile companies at visiting fairs, though from 1912 most of these travelling theatres settled, purchasing theatres to perform in.|$|E
5|$|The {{landscape}} {{around the}} bay features {{a mix of}} swamps, beaches, industrial facilities, tourist attractions, and historic sites.

40|$|The {{obligation}} to provide <b>fair</b> <b>and</b> equitable treatment to foreign investors and investments has existed {{as a concept}} of international economic law {{at least since the}} 1919 Covenant of the League of Nations. The <b>fair</b> <b>and</b> equitable treatment provision is a key protection contained {{in the vast majority of}} modern bilateral investment treaties. Tribunals adjudicating alleged breaches of these <b>fair</b> <b>and</b> equitable treatment provisions have not arrived at a uniform interpretation of the term. As a threshold issue, however each tribunal must address the question of whether a state 2 ̆ 7 s obligations under a given treaty 2 ̆ 7 s <b>fair</b> <b>and</b> equitable treatment provision will be additive or equal to the state 2 ̆ 7 s preexisting obligations toward all aliens under the minimum standard required by customary international law. Some tribunals have responded to this question by announcing that the protections afforded under <b>fair</b> <b>and</b> equitable treatment provisions and customary international law have converged such that a state 2 ̆ 7 s obligations under either standard are coextensive. This Note contends that tribunals adopting the convergence approach overstate the protections afforded to investors under customary international law. By subsuming the {{obligation to}} provide <b>fair</b> <b>and</b> equitable treatment within customary international law, these tribunals also ignore the historical development of <b>fair</b> <b>and</b> equitable treatment as a solely treaty-based obligation that did not bind states as a matter of customary international law...|$|R
