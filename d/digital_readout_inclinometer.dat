40|$|Two Brisco Scour Monitors were {{installed}} on pier MS 1 of the Mississippi River at Burlington in August 1991. No problems were encountered during the installation. The monitors {{consist of a}} probe resting on the river bottom fastened to a cable that wraps around a reel.

The intent was to monitor the <b>digital</b> <b>readout</b> twice a year during a four-year evaluation period.

40|$|In this master thesis <b>digital</b> <b>readout</b> {{systems for}} {{radiation}} detection and mea- surement {{has been studied}} and designed.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{measurements}} {{carried out on}} the Hybrid Photon Detectors (HPDs) of the LHCb RICH detectors.
