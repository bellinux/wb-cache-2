40|$|About twenty PIH {{cases and}} twenty normal {{pregnant}} {{women in their}} third trimester were subjected to haemorheological investigations. The whole blood viscosity (wbv) and plasma viscosity (pv) were significantly higher in the PIH group than in the normal group. <b>Filterability</b> <b>index</b> (I), haematocrit and plasma fibrinogen were not significantly elevated. Diastolic pressure in PIH was not significantly correlated {{with any of these}} viscosity parameters. However whole blood viscosity was significantly correlated and filterability was highly significantly correlated with foetal distress. This implies the role of pathohaemorheology in malperfusion in the foeto-placental circulation and subsequent perinatal morbidity associated with pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) ...|$|E
40|$|Clogging, {{measured}} through {{head loss}} across filters, and the filtration quality of different filters using different effluents were studied. The filters used were: 115, 130, and 200 m disc filters; 98, 115, 130, and 178 m screen filters; and a sand filter {{filled with a}} single layer of sand with an effective diameter of 0. 65 mm. The filters were used with a meat industry effluent and secondary and tertiary effluents of two wastewater treatment plants. It was observed that clogging depended {{on the type of}} effluent. With the meat industry effluent, the poorest quality effluent, disc filters clogged more than the other filter types. When the wastewater treatment plant effluents were used, the disc filters showed less frequent clogging. Several physical and chemical parameters, such as total suspended solids, chemical oxygen demand, turbidity, electrical conductivity, pH, and number of particles, were analyzed in the effluents at the entry and exit points of the filters. In general, filters did not reduce the values of the main clogging parameters to a great degree. It was found that the parameter that explained the clogging, expressed as Boucherâ€™s <b>filterability</b> <b>index,</b> was different {{depending on the type of}} effluent and filter. The best quality of filtration was achieved with a sand filter when the meat industry effluent was used. No significant differences were observed between the quality of filtration of disc and screen filters when operating with the secondary and tertiary effluent...|$|E
40|$|Experimental evidences {{underline}} that hemorheological alterations {{observed in}} {{acute myocardial infarction}} (AMI) are strictly involved in the decreased perfusion of the damaged area and in {{the extension of the}} necrotic regions. We have analyzed whole blood <b>filterability</b> as an <b>index</b> of erythrocyte deformability in 60 AMI patients compared with 30 patients with non-acute coronary artery disease and 52 healthy subjects. Nucleopore polycarbonate membranes with a pore diameter of 5 mu m and a filtering pressure of - 20 cm H 2 O were used. The results are expressed as the volume of whole blood filtered in 1 minute (<b>index</b> of <b>filterability,</b> IF). In normal subjects IF was 1. 16 +/- 0. 24. Among AMI patients IF was 0. 70 +/- 0. 30 at admission, 0. 68 +/- 017 at day 10 and 0. 78 +/- 0. 14 at day 20. These values were significantly lower than those obtained in normal subjects and in patients with non-acute coronary artery disease. In addition, AMI patients treated with thrombolytic therapy showed, at admission, a significantly higher IF value than that obtained in patients who did not receive thrombolytic treatment (0. 85 +/- 0. 34 vs 0. 60 +/- 0. 22; p< 0. 01). These results demonstrate an evident reduction of whole blood filterability in AMI patients that may be considered as an index of erythrocyte deformability. Thrombolytic therapy seems to {{have a positive effect on}} blood filterability and may produce beneficial effects through its therapeutical action other than the lysis of the coronary thrombus...|$|R
