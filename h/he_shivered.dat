2500|$|According to Tatsumi in a 2009 interview, the {{inspiration}} of a prison escape came from Alexandre Dumas' The Count of Monte Cristo, while he got the idea of two prisoners handcuffed together from a story in a pulp fiction magazine. In the autobiographical A Drifting Life, Tatsumi's protagonist Hiroshi reads Dumas' book, {{as well as a}} short story by [...] about [...] "two convicts handcuffed together, who escape while being escorted by police." [...] Hiroshi had been staying at a [...] "manga camp" [...] with other Hinomaru Bunko authors in order to work on their monthly collection Shadow, but was yearning to work on a full-length story. He pitched the idea of adapting Dumas' story as a ten-volume Japanese period piece, but his boss did not feel he was skilled enough or had enough time. After his brother Okimasa's hospitalization, he returned home and started work on Black Blizzard, which went smoothly and Tatsumi felt so involved, <b>he</b> <b>shivered</b> while drawing the cold mountain scenes. Inspired by films, Hiroshi had started to strive towards an [...] "anti-manga manga" [...] with works like The Silent Witness; his brother noted that Black Blizzard pacing was [...] "even more cinematic" [...] than his previous work and remarked: [...] "you can't even call this manga". The manga was well-received by Hiroshi's fellow authors, with Masaki Sato calling it [...] "the manga of the future".|$|E

60|$|Blacky didn't turn to {{come back}} as he had planned. He kept right on, just as if he hadn't seen anything, and as he flew <b>he</b> <b>shivered</b> a little. <b>He</b> <b>shivered</b> {{at the thought of}} what might have {{happened}} to him if he had tried to steal those eggs the day before and had been caught doing it.|$|E
6000|$|Now he hangs, he rocks between, and his {{nostrils}} curdle in-- [...] Toll slowly. [...] Now <b>he</b> <b>shivers</b> head and hoof and the flakes of foam fall off, [...] And his face grows fierce and thin: ...|$|R
60|$|Poor Bowser! <b>He</b> stood <b>shivering</b> {{and shaking}} {{on the ice}} of the strange river to which Old Man Coyote had led him, and he knew not which way to turn. Not only was <b>he</b> <b>shivering</b> and shaking from his cold bath, but he was bruised by his fall {{from the top of}} the steep bank, and he was so tired by his long run after Old Man Coyote that he could hardly stand.|$|R
60|$|They stood {{opposite}} each other, each {{feeling that}} there was more to be said: the girl tender, her eyes cast down, holding her hands to the fire; <b>he</b> <b>shivering,</b> but not with cold. He had a vague knowledge of the vast importance of the moment, and he hesitated to speak.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>shivered.</b> Nevertheless, he {{clutched}} {{her hands and}} drew her closer to him.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} the young man's eyes {{challenged}} his. Then they fell. <b>He</b> <b>shivered</b> a little.|$|E
60|$|The {{water was}} colder {{than he had}} anticipated, and <b>he</b> <b>shivered</b> {{slightly}} as he waded in deeper and deeper.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> sat <b>shivering</b> slightly, {{with the}} same timid look in his face as before.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the opening}} {{pages of the}} first issue of the 1986 limited series comic book The Dark Knight Returns, Snapper is shown {{spending}} his days in the [...] "hero bar" [...] with retired heroes. Snapper is the most nostalgic of these people and the one most interested in remembering the golden age of heroes, but like the others <b>he</b> <b>shivers</b> and hates it when anyone mentions Batman.|$|R
60|$|He {{dragged on}} his second shoe. <b>He</b> was <b>shivering</b> violently, and his jaw shook as he spoke.|$|R
60|$|The Professor rose hastily to his feet. As {{he turned}} around, he saw French concealing {{something}} in his hands. <b>He</b> <b>shivered.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>shivered</b> slightly, as if {{with the}} sudden blast of cold, humid air, but he stepped quietly into the cart, closely {{followed}} by Juliette.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>shivered.</b> He was in {{a curious}} state of mind but there seemed to him {{something}} heretical in placing Edith among the same sex.|$|E
60|$|Lincoln {{saw that}} Sanford was sick. <b>He</b> was <b>shivering,</b> and drops of sweat were on his white forehead. Lincoln stood aside silently {{and let him}} go out.|$|R
60|$|All {{this time}} <b>he</b> was <b>shivering</b> with cold; {{and every time}} he raised his hand to the knocker, the wind took the dressing-gown in a most {{unpleasant}} manner.|$|R
60|$|Jimmyâ€™s {{heart sank}} as <b>he</b> sat <b>shivering</b> {{at the helm}} while the bitter spray whirled about him and the sloop lurched on through the darkness, chased by foaming seas.|$|R
6000|$|... "You would tar and feather me?" [...] asked Tom, {{and now it}} must be {{confessed that}} <b>he</b> <b>shivered</b> {{in spite of his}} efforts to remain calm.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>shivered</b> {{and grew}} pale under {{the force of}} his brother's name uttered in that tone. He began to melt, subsiding into a jelly-mass of fear.|$|E
6000|$|The {{night had}} turned so cold, to Mr. Goodchild's sensations, that <b>he</b> <b>shivered.</b> He remarked lightly, and half apologetically, 'I think {{somebody}} is walking over my grave.' ...|$|E
60|$|In this he was disappointed. The {{bottom of}} the vat was {{perfectly}} level. By {{the time he had}} discovered this fact, <b>he</b> was <b>shivering</b> so <b>he</b> could hardly stand upright.|$|R
60|$|Soon {{the bells}} stop. He {{knows that he}} is alone now, {{but he does not}} {{understand}} it. The sun is shining brightly, but he sits very cold in his chair. <b>He</b> <b>shivers.</b> <b>He</b> is very glad to see his wife coming to him through the open window. She is a dear old lady, and is dressed brightly, as becomes one who has been to a wedding. Her face beams to match her gown. She is really quite a happy woman again, for it is several years since any deep sorrow struck her; and that is a long time. No one, you know, understands the Colonel as she does, no one can soothe him and bring him out of his imaginings as she can. He hastens to her. He is no longer cold. That is her great reward for all she does for him.|$|R
6000|$|... "'And {{suppose she}} waits about outside for me, and Mrs. Plimmer {{wants me to}} take 'er out?' <b>he</b> ses, <b>shivering.</b> 'She's a fearful obstinate woman; and she'd wait a week for me.' ...|$|R
60|$|When Cethru {{saw that}} {{all eyes were}} turned on him, <b>he</b> <b>shivered</b> still more violently, fixing his fascinated gaze on the three Judges in their emerald robes.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish I had my banjo!" [...] he exclaimed, impulsively. Then <b>he</b> <b>shivered.</b> [...] "Did {{you hear}} that? A banjo! I {{used to play}} it, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bosh!" [...] {{answered}} Alan, but all {{the same}} <b>he</b> <b>shivered</b> also. [...] "Jeekie," [...] he asked again, [...] "what happens to those people whom the Bonsas smell out?" ...|$|E
50|$|On a cold March day any {{traveller}} by the North Cornwall line {{may feel}} conceited {{as well as}} numbed. <b>He</b> <b>shivers</b> because the wind tries to shatter the windows from Egloskerry onwards; he is proud because he cannot think what the railway would do without him; {{for two or three}} shilings he has apparently bought the train, a rheumatic locomotive which wobbles and totters seawards, and a lot of little weather-beaten stations with two or three dummy men thrown in at each one, looking like Shems, Hams and Japhets standing on wooden plates all ready for the Ark.|$|R
60|$|LYDIA How mortifying, to {{remember}} the dear delicious shifts I used to be put to, to gain half a minute's conversation with this fellow! How often have I stole forth, in the coldest night in January, and found him in the garden, stuck like a dripping statue! There would he kneel {{to me in the}} snow, and sneeze and cough so pathetically! <b>he</b> <b>shivering</b> with cold and I with apprehension! and while the freezing blast numbed our joints, how warmly would he press me to pity his flame, and glow with mutual ardour!--Ah, Julia, that was something like being in love.|$|R
6000|$|... 'We had him out, {{and rubbed}} him; we wrapped {{him in a}} cloak, and gave him wine, and we leaned and looked upon him, the while he drank. <b>He</b> was <b>shivering,</b> but shameless.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>shivered</b> {{a little}} {{at the sight of}} it--he knew not why--and was glad when a dense black snow-cloud hid the face of the sun and killed it.|$|E
60|$|The embers became black, {{the night}} air had cooled the {{turbulent}} blood of Lord Montacute, <b>he</b> <b>shivered,</b> returned to his couch, and found a deep and invigorating repose.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hope not, I am sure," [...] {{answered}} Alan, and bethinking him of Big Bonsa wallowing {{and screaming}} {{on the water}} and bleeding out white blood, <b>he</b> <b>shivered</b> a little.|$|E
60|$|Arthur {{turned his}} eyes on Adam with a vague stare which {{gave way to a}} {{slightly}} startled motion as if from the shock of returning memory. But <b>he</b> only <b>shivered</b> again and said nothing.|$|R
60|$|He {{tried to}} stagger to his feet; {{but he was}} still ghastly pale and {{trembling}} in every limb. We helped him to a rock, where <b>he</b> sat <b>shivering</b> with his face buried in his hands.|$|R
60|$|And <b>he</b> gave a <b>shiver</b> {{that was}} as genuine as it was uncomfortable.|$|R
