25|$|Optical illusions (also called visual illusions) are {{characterized}} by visually perceived images that differ from objective reality. The information gathered by the eye is processed in the brain to give a percept that differs from the object being imaged. Optical illusions can {{be the result of}} a variety of phenomena including physical effects that create images that are different from the objects that make them, the physiological effects on the eyes and brain of <b>excessive</b> <b>stimulation</b> (e.g. brightness, tilt, colour, movement), and cognitive illusions where the eye and brain make unconscious inferences.|$|E
25|$|Excitotoxicity is the {{pathological}} {{process by which}} nerve cells are damaged or killed by <b>excessive</b> <b>stimulation</b> by neurotransmitters such as glutamate and similar substances. This occurs when receptors for the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate (glutamate receptors) such as the NMDA receptor and AMPA receptor are overactivated by glutamatergic storm. Excitotoxins like NMDA and kainic acid which bind to these receptors, as well as pathologically high levels of glutamate, can cause excitotoxicity by allowing high levels of calcium ions (Ca2+) to enter the cell. influx elicited by glutamate: role in neuronal death | url = | journal = Molecular Pharmacoloy | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 106–112 | pmid = 2568579 }} Ca2+ influx into cells activates a number of enzymes, including phospholipases, endonucleases, and proteases such as calpain. These enzymes go on to damage cell structures such as components of the cytoskeleton, membrane, and DNA.|$|E
500|$|Circumcision did {{not become}} a common medical {{procedure}} in the Anglophone world until the late 19th century. At that time, British and American doctors began recommending it primarily {{as a deterrent to}} masturbation. Prior to the 20th century, masturbation was believed to be the cause {{of a wide range of}} physical and mental illnesses including epilepsy, paralysis, impotence, gonorrhea, tuberculosis, feeblemindedness, and insanity. In 1855, motivated in part by an interest in promoting circumcision to reduce masturbation, English physician Jonathan Hutchinson published his findings that Jews had a lower prevalence of certain venereal diseases. While pursuing a successful career as a general practitioner, Hutchinson went on to advocate circumcision for health reasons for the next fifty years, and eventually earned a knighthood for his overall contributions to medicine. In America, one of the first modern physicians to advocate the procedure was Lewis Sayre, a founder of the American Medical Association. In 1870, Sayre began using circumcision as a purported cure for several cases of young boys diagnosed with paralysis or significant motor problems. He thought the procedure ameliorated such problems based on a [...] "reflex neurosis" [...] theory of disease, which held that <b>excessive</b> <b>stimulation</b> of the genitals was a disturbance to the equilibrium of the nervous system and a cause of systemic problems. The use of circumcision to promote good health also fit in with the germ theory of disease during that time, which saw the foreskin as being filled with infection-causing smegma (a mixture of shed skin cells and oils). [...] Sayre published works on the subject and promoted it energetically in speeches. [...] Contemporary physicians picked up on Sayre's new treatment, which they believed could prevent or cure a wide-ranging array of medical problems and social ills. [...] Its popularity spread with publications such as Peter Charles Remondino's History of Circumcision. [...] By the turn of the century, in both America and Great Britain, infant circumcision was near universally recommended.|$|E

60|$|Nearly an hour elapsed. During that {{interval}} {{the sound}} of Victor's voice, raised in passionate recital, might have been heard by the occupants of the larger room but that they were completely involved in their own smoky atmosphere, and were perhaps politely oblivious of the stranger's business. They chatted, compared notes, and examined legal documents with the excited and pleased curiosity of men to whom business and the present importance of its results was a novelty. At {{a few minutes before}} nine Don Pedro reappeared with Victor. I grieve to say that either from the reaction of the intense excitement of the morning, from the active sympathy of his friend, or from the equally soothing anodyne of aguardiente, he was somewhat incoherent, interjectional, and effusive. The effect of <b>excessive</b> <b>stimulation</b> on passionate natures like Victor's is to render them either maudlin or affectionate. Mr. Ramirez was both. He demanded with tears in his eyes to be led to the ladies. He would seek in the company of Manuela, the stout female before introduced to the reader, that sympathy which an injured, deceived, and confiding nature like his own so deeply craved.|$|E
60|$|So {{there was}} violent action in politics, and violent and <b>excessive</b> <b>stimulation</b> in literature, the {{positive}} effects of the force moved in each sphere being deplorably small in proportion to the intense moral energy which gave the impulse. In literature the straining for mental liberty was the more futile of the two, because it expressed the ardent and hopeless longing of the individual for a life which we may perhaps best call life unconditioned. And this unconditioned life, which the Byronic hero vainly seeks, and not finding, he fills the world with stormy complaint, is least of all likely to offer itself in any approximate form to men penetrated with gross and egotistical passions to their inmost core. The Byronic hero went to clasp repose in a frenzy. All crimson and aflame with passion, he groaned for evening stillness. He insisted on being free, in the corroding fetters of resentment and scorn for men. Conrad sought balm for disappointment of spirit in vehement activity of body. Manfred represents the confusion common to the type, between thirst for the highest knowledge and proud violence of unbridled will. Harold is held in a middle way of poetic melancholy, equally far from a speechless despair and from gay and reckless licence, by contemplation of the loveliness of external nature, and the great exploits and perishing monuments of man in the past; but he, equally with the others, embodies the paradoxical hope that angry isolation and fretful estrangement from mankind are equivalent to emancipation from their pettiness, instead of being its very climax and demonstration. As if freedom of soul could exist without orderly relations of intelligence and partial acceptance between a man and the sum of surrounding circumstances. That universal protest which rings through Byron's work with a plangent resonance, very different from the whimperings of punier men, is a proof that so far from being free, one's whole being is invaded and laid waste. It is no ignoble mood, and it was a most inevitable product of the mental and social conditions of Western Europe {{at the close of the}} eighteenth century. Everlasting protest, impetuous energy of will, melancholy and despondent reaction;--this is the revolutionary course. Cain and Conrad; then Manfred and Lara and Harold.|$|E

50|$|It is {{sometimes}} reported that people poisoned by organophosphate insecticides experience the same symptoms as nicotine poisoning. Organophosphates inhibit an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase, causing {{a buildup of}} acetylcholine, <b>excessive</b> <b>stimulation</b> {{of all types of}} cholinergic neurons, and a wide range of symptoms. Nicotine is specific for nicotinic cholinergic receptors only and has some, but not all of the symptoms of organophosphate poisoning.|$|E
50|$|The {{symptoms}} of nicotine poisoning {{are caused by}} <b>excessive</b> <b>stimulation</b> of nicotinic cholinergic neurons. Nicotine is an agonist at nicotinic acetylcholine receptor which {{are present in the}} central and autonomic nervous systems, and the neuromuscular junction. At low doses nicotine causes stimulatory effects on these receptors, however, higher doses or more sustained exposures can cause inhibitory effects leading to neuromuscular blockade.|$|E
50|$|The {{primary site}} of action {{appears to be the}} motor cortex where spread of seizure {{activity}} is inhibited.

50|$|Acetylcholine is a {{neurotransmitter}} in {{the nervous}} system, it targets muscarinic and nicotinic receptors and receptors {{in the central}} nervous system.
