40|$|International audienceThe {{paradigm}} of Compressive Sensing (CS) {{has emerged in}} the last few years as a flexible and powerful methodological strategy to address synthesis and analysis problems arising in wave <b>scattering</b> and <b>propagation</b> engineering. The success of CS techniques is motivated by several factors, including (i) their capability to address sampling/recovery problems overcoming the classical Nyquist/Shannon limits, (ii) their flexibility and ease of adaptation to several different scenarios, including array design, direction-of-arrival estimation, microwave and radar imaging, (iii) the availability of powerful, effective, and numerically efficient implementations of CS sampling and retrieval algorithms. Accordingly, and despite their relatively recent introduction, the research on the development, application, generalization, and customization of CS techniques has already become one of the most active areas within wave <b>scattering</b> and <b>propagation</b> engineering. Within this framework, this invited paper is aimed at illustrating the fundamental features of Compressive Sensing as well as at discussing its potential applicability in wave <b>scattering</b> and <b>propagation</b> problems also through a review of the recent advances in the state-of-the-art concerning CS. Some current research trends and open challenges will be also discussed...|$|R

40|$|The highly exoergic {{nucleophilic}} substitution reaction F- + CH 3 I shows reaction dynamics strikingly {{different from}} that of substitution reactions of larger halogen anions. Over a wide range of collision energies, a large fraction of <b>indirect</b> <b>scattering</b> via a long-lived hydrogen-bonded complex is found both in crossed-beam imaging experiments and in direct chemical dynamics simulations. Our measured differential scattering cross sections show large-angle scattering and low product velocities for all collision energies, resulting from efficient transfer of the collision energy to internal energy of the CH 3 F reaction product. Both findings are in strong contrast to the previously studied substitution reaction of Cl - + CH 3 I [Science 2008, 319, 183 - 186] at all but the lowest collision energies, a discrepancy that was not captured in a subsequent study at only a low collision energy [J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2010, 1, 2747 - 2752]. Our direct chemical dynamics simulations at the DFT/B 97 - 1 level of theory show that the reaction is dominated by three atomic-level mechanisms, an indirect reaction proceeding via an F [...] HCH 2 I hydrogen-bonded complex, a direct rebound, and a direct stripping reaction. The indirect mechanism is found to contribute about one-half of the overall substitution reaction rate at both low and high collision energies. This large fraction of <b>indirect</b> <b>scattering</b> at high collision energy is particularly surprising, because the barrier for the F [...] HCH 2 I complex to form products is only 0. 10 eV.
