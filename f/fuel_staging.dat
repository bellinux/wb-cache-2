50|$|Cam-less engines {{can further}} reduce NOx {{emissions}} {{with the use}} of <b>fuel</b> <b>staging.</b> Instead of simply injecting a constant stream of fuel, <b>fuel</b> <b>staging</b> injects the fuel at the optimal time for the most complete combustion. This is paricularly useful for the MAN B&W ME engine because of its long stroke. Fuel injection can shut off when there is sufficient pressure and add more fuel when there is less pressure making the engines closer to a perfect diesel cycle. This allows the engine to run as efficiently as the environment and heat capacity of the metal will allow.|$|E
50|$|Missile 5C (February 20) {{performed}} well until BECO, {{at which point}} the <b>fuel</b> <b>staging</b> disconnect valve failed, causing a gradual fuel leak and decay in tank pressures. When propellant levels in the tank dropped low enough, the open staging disconnect valve allowed helium pressure gas to escape, causing a more rapid pressure loss. At approximately T+168 seconds, the intermediate bulkhead reversed, followed by explosion of the missile at T+172 seconds.|$|E
50|$|Atlas 5D {{lifted from}} LC-13 on June 6. The flight went {{perfectly}} until booster separation, {{at which point}} a fuel leak started. Tank pressure decreased until the intermediate bulkhead reversed at T+157 seconds and the missile exploded. This incident was similar in nature to an Atlas C failure {{earlier in the year}} and it resulted in a major investigation and redesign effort. The failure point was either the <b>fuel</b> <b>staging</b> disconnect valve or associated plumbing, and modifications were made to the disconnect valve, plumbing, booster separation system, jettison tracks, and even the launcher mechanism, all of which were possible causes of the malfunction. On July 29, Missile 11D was launched with a series of modifications designed to correct problems on previous Atlas launches. The flight was mostly successful and booster section separation was performed successfully on a D-series Atlas for the first time, but some difficulties with the hydraulic system occurred due to low engine compartment temperatures caused by a probable LOX leak. Missile 14D launched from LC-13 on August 11, at which point the Air Force somewhat reluctantly declared the Atlas to be operational as a missile system. On September 9, Missile 12D launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, marking the first Atlas flight from the West Coast. Eight more D-series ICBM tests were conducted in 1959, as well as two space launches using Atlas D vehicles. Although assorted minor failures and hardware bugs affected these flights, the overall success rate was a major improvement over {{the first half of the}} year.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} {{characteristics of a}} Precessing Jet (PJ) burner, developed at the University of Adelaide, have been investigated in Furnace No. 1 of the International Flame Research Foundation firing natural gas with air pre-heated to 320 °C. Results showed that the PJ burner, operating without air swirl, <b>fuel</b> <b>staging</b> or FGR, produces NOₓ emissions of about 57 ppm (dry, 3 % O₂) which {{is comparable to the}} performance of a swirled flame operated at optimised conditions with either flue gas recirculation, FGR, or <b>fuel</b> <b>staging.</b> The emissions are significantly lower than the 134 ppm measured for the base-line swirl burner, but greater than the 37 ppm measured for the swirl burner operated with both FGR and <b>fuel</b> <b>staging.</b> The flame was investigated by means of in-flame measurement of temperature and species concentration using suction probes and by laser sheet visualisation and subsequently derived probability density functions of jet fluid concentration. These techniques show that the mixing and combustion processes are dominated by the presence of large scale structures. It is anticipated that a more complete understanding of the interaction between the large scale turbulence and the combustion process will lead to further improvements in the performance of the burner.

40|$|The design {{principle}} of injecting liquid fuel {{at more than}} one axial station in an annual turbojet combustor was investigated. Fuel was injected into the combustor as much as 5 inches downstream of the primary fuel injectors. Many fuel-injection configurations were examined and the performance results are presented for 11 configurations that best demonstrate the trends in performance obtained. The performance investigations were made at a constant combustor-inlet pressure of 15 inches of mercury absolute and at air flows up to 70 percent higher than values typical of current design practice. At these higher air flows, staging the fuel introduction improved the combustion efficiency considerably over that obtained in the combustor when no <b>fuel</b> <b>staging</b> was employed. At air flows currently encountered in turbojet engines, <b>fuel</b> <b>staging</b> was of minor value.

40|$|Stricter {{emission}} limits and low prices for fossil fuels are considerable challenges for biomass combustion technologies. Fraunhofer UMSICHT provides solutions for these challenges with an innovative boiler concept developed {{within the last}} years. The prototype was tested in the combustion center at Fraunhofer UMSICHT. Due to its design the boiler can be operated in different modes as a combi-boiler for solid and gaseous fuels. In the standard mode solid biomass is used as fuel. In case of higher NOX-emissions, switching to the <b>fuel</b> <b>staging</b> mode enables the reduction of these emissions.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{evaluation}} of emissions of NOx and CO formed during the combustion process when the burner utilizing <b>fuel</b> <b>staging</b> and internal flue gas recirculation is used. In the theoretical part the NOx formation mechanisms and methods used to suppress their formation are described. This is followed with the currently valid legislation in the Czech Republic {{in terms of the}} emission limits for NOx and CO in stationary sources. In the work, combustion tests were performed at the burners testing facility at UPEI BUT.

The equipment is installed in the burner’s air channel. The dependence of flue gas temperature, heat flux to the combustion chamber’s section walls and in-flame temperatures distribution in the horizontal symmetry plane of the combustion chamber on various parameters were investigated. The parameters included the geometry of the equipment for flue gas recirculation, primary/secondary ratio, geometry of nozzles for secondary fuel supply, tangential orientation of these nozzles towards the burner axis, and the excess of combustion air...|$|E
