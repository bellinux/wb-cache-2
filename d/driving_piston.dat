40|$|The {{current study}} {{addresses}} {{the stability of}} shock waves propagating through dissipative media, analogous to both granular media and molecular gases undergoing endothermic reactions. In order to investigate the stability, a simple molecular dynamics model was developed to observe shock waves and their structures with the inclusion of energy dissipation. For this, an Event Driven Molecular Dynamics model was implemented in a 2 D environment, where a molecule is represented by a disk. The simulations addressed {{the formation of a}} shock wave in a gas by the sudden acceleration of a piston. Inelastic collisions were assumed to occur only if an impact velocity threshold is surpassed, representing the activation energy of the dissipative reactions. Parametric studies were conducted for this molecular model, by varying the strength of the shock wave, the activation threshold and the degree of inelasticity in the collisions. The resulting simulations showed that a shock structure does indeed become unstable with the presence of dissipative collisions. This instability manifests itself in the form of distinctive high density non-uniformities behind the shock wave, which take the form of convective rolls. The spacing and size of this ``finger-like" unstable pattern was shown to be dependent on the degree of inelasticity, the activation energy, and the strength of the <b>driving</b> <b>piston.</b> The mechanism responsible for the instability was addressed by studying the time evolution of the material undergoing the shock wave compression and further relaxation.

40|$|Wormlike {{micelles}} are viscoelastic fluids {{that present}} an intermediate behavior between solids and ordinary liquids {{since they are}} elastic at short time scales but flow easily at large time scales. In opposition to Newtonian fluids, which have constant viscosity, these fluids usually exhibit a non-Newtonian response with a rate-dependent shear viscosity. Wall-bounded oscillatory flows of Newtonian and complex fluids are found in many practical situations. Oscillatory pipe flows are especially important in physiology {{in connection with the}} circulatory and respiratory systems of human beings, as well as in industrial processes such as fluid pumping, secondary oil recovery or filtration, and in acoustics. Pulsating flows are of particular interest also in the rheological characterization of complex fluids. We analyze the laminar oscillatory flow of viscoelastic fluids using the Maxwell and Oldroyd-B models. We have shown that in wall-bounded oscillatory flows of viscoelastic fluids the two characteristic lengths of the Ferry waves, the damping length and wavelength, together with the characteristic separation of the walls, define all the flow properties for fluid models with a linear shear-stress equation in unidirectional flow. In wall-bounded settings there exists the possibility that shear waves generated at different locations superpose themselves before decaying so that the shear waves interfere, giving rise to a resonant flow at well defined frequencies of driving. The theoretical predictions obtained for the laminar velocity profiles are validated by carrying out time-resolved Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) experiments in a vertical pipe at small driving amplitudes. The oscillatory pipe flow has been investigated in the whole range of experimentally accessible driving frequencies and amplitudes, and classified in three main flow regimes: laminar, vortical, and non-axisymmetric vortical. By ramping up and down the driving amplitude at constant frequency {{we have been able to}} characterize the transition from laminar to more complex flows, under controlled driving conditions. The first hydrodynamic instability occurs when the laminar base flow becomes unstable against the formation of axisymmetric toroidal vortices that appear distributed along the cylinder. The calculation of root-mean-square fluctuations in the vertical direction, of the vertical and radial components of the velocity (averaged in time or over the tube diameter) has allowed to determine the critical amplitude at which the instability sets in with high accuracy. In the vortical flow an abrupt increase of the fluctuations is observed, that accounts for the loss of the vertical translational symmetry and the formation of vortices in the flow. This transition exhibits hysteresis when the driving amplitude is ramped up and down, which makes us presume that the bifurcation from the laminar flow has a subcritical nature. A second hydrodynamic instability occurs when the vortical flow loses the axial symmetry. In this flow regime the vortices are heavily distorted and no longer axisymmetric. The velocity and vorticity maps of the vortical flow measured in a meridional plane of the tube appear periodic in time, on time scales comparable to the driving period. Interestingly, the vortex formation is favored in the acceleration phases of the piston oscillation. Besides, we have uncovered a spatio-temporal dynamics on long time scales (much larger than the relaxation time of the fluid) that substantially modifies the flow organization. This slow dynamics is more effective in the bottom half of the cylinder, specially next to the <b>driving</b> <b>piston.</b> A global inspection of the vortical flow along the tube length reveals that the instability takes place earlier in the bottom part of the tube, in the vicinity of the <b>driving</b> <b>piston.</b> At increasing the driving amplitude the boundary between laminar and vortical flow progressively raises towards the top regions. And above a critical driving amplitude the entire fluid flow is vortical. The mechanism triggering the hydrodynamic instability from the laminar to the axisymmetric vortical flow is not yet clear. L'objectiu d'aquesta Tesi és estudiar el flux oscil•latori vertical en fluids micel•lars. Els fluids micel•lars són fluids complexos amb propietats viscoelàstiques, de manera que mostren un comportament intermedi entre els sòlids i els líquids: són elàstics a escales de temps curtes però flueixen a escales de temps més llargues. En contraposició als fluids Newtonians, que tenen una viscositat constant, els fluids complexos mostren un comportament no-Newtonià, amb una viscositat que depèn del ritme de deformació. El fluxos oscil•latoris de fluids Newtonians o complexos en geometries confinades són especialment importants en fisiologia, en relació amb el sistema circulatori i respiratori d'éssers humans, i també en processos industrials com el bombejat de fluids, l'extracció de petroli, i en particular són interessants en la caracterització reològica de fluids complexos. Primer estudiem el flux oscil•latori des d'una perspectiva teòrica i analitzem el flux laminar de fluids viscoelàstics utilitzant els models de Maxwell i Oldroyd-B en un tub vertical. Hem mostrat que en fluxos confinats existeix la possibilitat que les ones de cisalla generades a les diferents parets se sobreposin abans d'esmorteir-se i que eventualment donin lloc a un fenomen de ressonància. Les prediccions teòriques obtingudes pel flux laminar són validades duent a terme experiments de Velocimetria d'Imatges de Partícules (PIV) en un tub vertical, per amplituds petites del forçament oscil•latori. Quan s'incrementa l'amplitud de l'oscil•lació el flux laminar evoluciona cap a fluxos que presenten una dependència espai-temporal més complexa. Fent rampes d'amplitud creixent a una freqüència fixada hem pogut caracteritzar experimentalment la transició del flux laminar a aquests fluxos més complexos, sota condicions de forçament ben controlades. La primera inestabilitat apareix quan el flux laminar esdevé inestable amb la corresponent formació d'anells de vorticitat apilats al llarg del tub. Es manifesta una segona inestabilitat per amplituds del forçament més grans, per la qual el flux vortical perd la simetria axial. En aquest nou règim els vòrtex estan fortament distorsionats i no són axisimètrics. Fent rampes d’amplitud creixent i decreixent hem observat que aquestes dues transicions presenten histèresi, i que per tant són de caràcter subcrític...|$|E
40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. An experimental {{investigation of the}} shape of shock waves in a circular shock tube is conducted. It is found {{that there are three}} distinct regimes governed, in a given tube, by the initial pressure in the test section. At very low pressures, where the shock thickness is greater than about half the tube radius, the axial extent (deviation from a plane) of the shock is roughly constant and dominated by the viscous interaction between the "shock", the boundary layer, and the <b>driving</b> <b>piston</b> of gas. This range of pressures is called the viscosity-dominated regime. At intermediate pressures, the shape of the shock is very nearly that predicted by the theory of de Boer, the shock curvature being produced by the boundary layer and the axial extent being roughly inversely proportional to the square root of the initial pressure. This is the boundary layer regime. de Boer's work is extended and the shock shapes for both the two-dimensional and axisymmetric cases are computed and plotted. At high pressures, the shape of the shock is complex and varies periodically down the tube. This shape is determined by transverse waves produced at the diaphragm (or other upstream disturbance) and reflecting {{back and forth across the}} tube, decaying with the square root of the distance down the tube. In this transverse wave regime, the axial extent of the shock is essentially independent of initial pressure and is much greater than had been expected. The square root decay of the transverse wave disturbances is in contrast to the 3 / 2 power decay predicted by Freeman and apparently verified by Lapworth. The experimental data of Lapworth is re-plotted and it is shown that if this data is analyzed in a slightly different manner it appears to exhibit square root decay. It is shown that the shock perturbations which exist in the transverse wave regime are absent at lower pressures. The transition region where these disturbances suddenly disappear seems to correspond approximately to the initial pressure at which the boundary layer (appropriately defined) at the disturbance fills the tube. A rule of thumb is developed from which it should be possible to predict the transition initial pressure (which separates the transverse wave and boundary layer regimes) in any given shock tube. This pressure occurs when the quantity [ [...] . ] is of order one, the tube dimensions being in millimeters and the initial pressure in millimeters of mercury. This rule of thumb is used to analyze the results of several shock tube experiments published by other researchers. Using this rule of thumb as an important constraint, a low pressure shock tube design chart is developed, from which, given the type of experiments contemplated and the nature of the instrumentation available, the proper shock tube dimensions and operating pressures may be determined. Finally, avenues of future research are suggested, wherein it may be possible to design a new type of "hi-fi" shock tube, capable of producing more nearly plane shock fronts for use in shock structure and relaxation time studies, especially where methods such as integrated schlieren, optical reflectivity, or electron beam scattering are to be used...|$|E
