40|$|The {{standard}} oracle operator {{corresponding to}} a function f is a unitary operator that computes this function coherently, i. e. it maintains superpositions. This operator acts on a bipartite system, where the subsystems are the <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> <b>registers.</b> In distributed quantum computation, these subsystems may be spatially separated, {{in which case}} we will be interested in its classical and entangling capacities. For an arbitrary function f, we show that the unidirectional classical and entangling capacities of this operator are log_{ 2 }(n_{f}) bits/ebits, where n_{f} {{is the number of}} different values this function can take. An optimal procedure for bidirectional classical communication with a standard oracle operator corresponding to a permutation on Z_{M} is given. The bidirectional classical capacity of such an operator is found to be 2 log_{ 2 }(M) bits. The proofs of these capacities are facilitated by an optimal distributed protocol for the implementation of an arbitrary standard oracle operator. Comment: 4. 4 pages, Revtex 4.

40|$|A novel {{approach}} is proposed {{in this paper}} {{for the implementation of}} 2 D DWT using hybrid wave-pipelining (WP). A digital circuit may be operated at a higher frequency by using either pipelining or WP. Pipelining requires additional registers and it results in more area, power dissipation and clock routing complexity. Wave-pipelining does not have any of these disadvantages but requires complex trial and error procedure for tuning the clock period and clock skew between <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> <b>registers.</b> In this paper, a hybrid scheme is proposed to get the benefits of both pipelining and WP techniques. In this paper, two automation schemes are proposed for the implementation of 2 D DWT using hybrid WP on both Xilinx, San Jose, CA, USA and Altera FPGAs. In the first scheme, Built-in self-test (BIST) {{approach is}} used to choose the clock skew and clock period for I/O registers between the wave-pipelined blocks. In the second approach, an on-chip soft-core processor is used to choose the clock skew and clock period. The results for the hybrid WP are compared with nonpipelined and pipelined approaches. From the implementation results, the hybrid WP scheme requires the same area but faster than the nonpipelined scheme by a factor of 1. 25 – 1. 39. The pipelined scheme is faster than the hybrid scheme by a factor of 1. 15 – 1. 39 at the cost of {{an increase in the number}} of registers by a factor of 1. 78 – 2. 73, increase in the number of LEs by a factor of 1. 11 – 1. 32 and it increases the clock routing complexity...|$|R
40|$|Machine-code slicing is an {{important}} primitive for building binary analysis and rewriting tools, such as taint trackers, fault localizers, and partial evaluators. However, {{it is not easy}} to create a machine-code slicer that exhibits a high level of precision. Moreover, the problem of creating such a tool is compounded by the fact that a small amount of local imprecision can be amplified via cascade effects. Most instructions in instruction sets such as Intel's IA- 32 and ARM are multi-assignments: they have several <b>inputs</b> and several <b>outputs</b> (<b>registers,</b> flags, and memory locations). This aspect of the instruction set introduces a granularity issue during slicing: there are often instructions at which we would like the slice to include only a subset of the instruction's multiple assignments, whereas the slice is forced to include the entire instruction. Consequently, the slice computed by state-of-the-art tools is very imprecise, often including essentially the entire program. We present an algorithm to slice machine code more accurately. To counter the granularity issue, our algorithm attempts to include in the slice only the subset of assignments in an instruction's semantics that is relevant to the slicing criterion. Our experiments on IA- 32 binaries of FreeBSD utilities show that, in comparison to slices computed by a state-of-the-art tool, our algorithm reduces the number of instructions in backward slices by 36 %, and in forward slices by 82 %...|$|R

The complete system consisting of three main blocks, which are the threshold inverter quantization (TIQ) -comparator, the encoder and the parallel <b>input</b> serial <b>output</b> (PISO) <b>register.</b> The TIQ-comparator functions as quantization of the analog data to the thermometer code. The encoder converts this thermometer code to 6 -bit binary code and the PISO register transforms the parallel data into a data series. The design aims to get a flash ADC on low power dissipation, small size and compatible with the temperature sensors. The method is proposed to set each of the transistor channel length to find out the threshold voltage difference of the inverter on the TIQ comparator. A portion design encoder and PISO registers circuit selected a simple circuit with the best performance from previous studies and adjusted to this system.
