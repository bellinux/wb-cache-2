Thus along the river at points of many closely spaced crossings, a clearance zone was created.

A wide range of data compiled and used in this investigation which include produced maps in 1939, 1982 and 2003, and hydrological data. Compiled data drew a complete picture for up-to-date information on morphological changes since 1939. The analysis indicated that islands length; thus, area has reduced since 1939. Also, islands tend to reshape by elongating. <b>The</b> reduction <b>in</b> area is attributed <b>in</b> part to <b>the</b> merging of islands in either bank and adjustment of the river to the new flow conditions after the operation of High Aswan Dam. El-Mansouria Island which is <b>the</b> largest island <b>in</b> area was focused on.
