Elbow saw a 700% sales increase of their album The Seldom Seen Kid after winning the Prize in 2008.

500|$|Patton {{attracted}} controversy {{as military}} governor {{when it was}} noted that several former Nazi Party members continued to hold political posts in the region. When responding to the press about the subject, Patton repeatedly compared Nazis to Democrats and Republicans in noting {{that most of the people}} with experience in infrastructure management had been compelled to join the party in the war, causing negative press stateside and angering Eisenhower. On September 28, 1945, after a heated exchange with Eisenhower over his statements, Patton was relieved of his military governorship. He was relieved of command of the Third Army on October 7, and in a somber change of command ceremony, Patton concluded his farewell remarks, [...] "All good things must come to an end. The best thing that <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> to me thus far is the honor and privilege of having commanded the Third Army." ...|$|E
500|$|One {{significant}} {{feature of}} the Premier League in the mid-2000s was {{the dominance of the}} so-called [...] "Big Four" [...] clubs: Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United. During this decade, they dominated the top four spots, which came with UEFA Champions League qualification, taking all top-four places in 5 out of 6 seasons from 2003–04 to 2008–09 inclusive. Arsenal went as far as winning the league without losing a single game in 2003–04, the only time it <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> in the Premier League. In May 2008 Kevin Keegan stated that [...] "Big Four" [...] dominance threatened the division, [...] "This league is in danger of becoming one of the most boring but great leagues in the world." [...] Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said in defence: [...] "There {{are a lot of different}} tussles that go on in the Premier League depending on whether you're at the top, in the middle or at the bottom that make it interesting." ...|$|E

500|$|School {{officials}} again {{asked students}} about the sign after Nixon mentioned his visit to Deshler in the victory speech, and this time Cole came forward. She stated {{that she had not}} done so before as she had not written the sign. Reporters interviewed the girl in the principal's office. Cole stated she felt Nixon was the one who could bring the country together again. Being interviewed by reporters from Washington, New York, and Chicago, she indicated, was more fun than sitting in history class. The Toledo Blade investigated the matter, but could not ascertain who made the sign, or what happened to it after Cole discarded it. John Baer, village chief of police, stated, [...] "I think this has {{to be the most important}} thing that <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> around here." [...] Paul Scharf, editor of the Deshler Flag, stated he did not believe the mystery of the sign's origin or fate would ever be cleared up. Safire stated he was told by Moore that the sign stood out as obviously handmade and not produced by the local Nixon campaign.|$|E
500|$|The Kids' WB {{version of}} the Cardcaptors dub was panned by critics. Jake Godek of THEM Anime called it [...] "the worst thing that <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> to anime that had a good Japanese name," [...] with the dubbing being [...] "one of the worst if not the worst dubbing done for a program." [...] He also criticized the editing, saying that it had [...] "demolished the plot" [...] and noting that it cut out vital {{character}} backgrounds {{needed in order to}} understand the show. Adam Arnold of Animefringe, reviewing the first Cardcaptors DVD, said it was [...] "nothing more than an attempt to dilute a fan favorite anime," [...] with the dubbed voices described as [...] "not up-to-par with the originals." [...] The ordering of the episodes on the DVD was also criticized, noting that starting with episode eight meant that the cast are [...] "left without their backgrounds fleshed out." [...] However, he also approved of the episode stories being left intact, and praised the voices of Carly McKillip as Sakura Avalon and Rhys Huber as Syaoran Li, stating that they were [...] "only voices that really shine above the rest." ...|$|E
500|$|The NBA {{revised the}} {{schedule}} to play two preseason games and a 66-game regular season schedule per team {{rather than the}} standard seven preseason games and an 82-game regular season schedule. Teams were allowed to contact players' agents on November 30. Players could begin working out voluntarily at team facilities with trainers on December 1, but coaches and general managers {{were not allowed to}} observe the workouts nor could any drills be conducted. NBA teams began talking to free agents on December 5, 2011 at 10 a.m. EST. Training camps and free agency started on December 9 with the regular season beginning on Christmas Day with five games, two more than the original schedule. ESPN/ABC analyst Jeff Van Gundy said about the NBA opening on Christmas Day: [...] "It's a different opening day than <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> in the past and Christmas Day games have always been a big day for the NBA. This unique situation combined with the unveiling of a championship banner for the Mavericks in a finals rematch, and then to see the Lakers and the debut of Mike Brown as head coach, those things are all going to be very compelling." ...|$|E

Rivers stated that she was {{impressed}} by Washington's civility: [...] "The people are lots better up here than they are down South. [...] They treat you much nicer. Why, when I was out there at the march a white man stepped on my foot, and he said, [...] "Excuse me," [...] and I said [...] "Certainly!"

2500|$|Before Jesus, {{exorcism}} {{had been}} {{conducted by a}} trained practitioner who offered a diagnosis and administered a ritual usually employing spoken formularies, amulets or other objects, or compounds of substances resembling pharmacological recipes of the time. Jesus's approach seemed radical because it depended on spiritual authority alone. Jesus casts out the pneuma alalon {{in front of a}} crowd who exclaim [...] "Nothing like this <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> in Israel!" [...] The Pharisees, also witnesses, counter that [...] "the leader of the demons gives him power to force out demons." [...] This accusation leads to the [...] "Beelzebub controversy." [...] warns that attributing the power of the Holy Spirit to possession by an [...] "unclean spirit" [...] is a sin that cannot be forgiven. The theological concept is difficult and subject to varying interpretations.|$|E
2500|$|... "First of all, {{you should}} {{ensure that the}} people will not die of starvation. In many parts of Tibet, the {{inhabitants}} died of starvation. Entire families perished and the death rate is extremely high. This is unacceptable, terrible and very grave. Once upon a time Tibet lived through a dark age of barbaric feudalism, but there were never any such shortages of food, especially after the rise of Buddhism. In the Tibetan regions, the masses are living in such poverty that the elderly and children are dying of starvation or are so weak that {{they are unable to}} fight off diseases and they die. Never anything like this <b>has</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> before in the entire history of Tibet. No one could imagine such terrible famines, not even in your worst dreams. In some areas, if someone gets a cold, they inevitably contaminate hundreds of other people and the majority die." ...|$|E

[...] Some of the unusual hardships of performing to active troops were described in an article he wrote for Variety, in 1942: [...] "In order to entertain all the boys ... it became necessary for us to give shows in foxholes, gun emplacements, dugouts, to construction groups on military roads; in fact, any place where two or more soldiers were gathered together, it automatically became a Winter Garden for me and I would give a show."
