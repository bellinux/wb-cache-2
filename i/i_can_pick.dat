In an interview with The Times of India she revealed, [...] "I'm not quitting films, I'm just being selective. Fortunately, I'm {{in a position where}} <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> and choose."

[...] " [...] gives access {{to a bunch of}} retards to talk to me," [...] Caleb said. [...] "I don't really enjoy having to see somebody telling me what song I have to sing. I think at this point of the competition, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> and choose my own songs and represent me. I don't need 10,000 people saying, 'You should sing this, you should sing that.

On May 9, 2015, Parks performed what he called his [...] "final piano performance" [...] at the Largo in Los Angeles. Guest performers included singer Gaby Moreno; songwriter-producer Joe Henry; Grizzly Bear's Edward Droste; New Zealand singer-songwriter Kimbra; and jazz guitarist-composer Grant Geissman. On upcoming projects, Parks said: [...] " [...] set poetry to music, to underscore poems. So I will still be performing once I get that done. I will be looking to find a celebrated string quartet to take things to an irreducible minimum. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> up a quartet in Peoria, or in Europe, to perform something like this. I also hope to find a film project that interests me." ...|$|E

[...] Atkins played guitar on the track. At {{the end of the}} song, Black and Atkins had a brief conversation.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{certainly}} am," [...] was Slaty's prompt response. [...] "It {{will take}} pretty bad weather {{to drive me}} away from here. If the snow gets too deep I'll just go up to Farmer Brown's barnyard. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> always <b>pick</b> up a meal there, for Farmer Brown's boy {{is a very good}} friend of mine.

6000|$|... "No, I read {{little or}} nothing," [...] said he, {{when my father}} marvelled where he got his knowledge. [...] "The fact is that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> hardly <b>pick</b> up a print without seeing some allusion to myself: 'Sir C. T. does this,' or 'Sir C. T. says the other,' so I take them no longer. But if a man is in my {{position}} all knowledge comes to him. The Duke of York tells me of the Army in the morning, and Lord Spencer chats with me of the Navy in the afternoon, and Dundas whispers me what is going forward in the Cabinet, so that I have little need of the Times or the Morning Chronicle." ...|$|R
5000|$|Joni Mitchell {{originally}} {{wrote the}} song in response to her record label's desire for her to write a hit song. Mitchell reveals her purpose on lines such as, [...] "And I'm sending you out this signal here, <b>I</b> hope you <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> it up loud and clear". She believed that including words in the song about radio themes would convince stations to play the recording. The song was recorded in preparation for Mitchell's upcoming fifth studio album in Hollywood, California, United States at A&M Studios. Although Graham Nash, David Crosby, and Neil Young all contributed to the recording session for the song, only the harmonica piece performed by Graham Nash was included on the official release.|$|R
500|$|The team {{wanted to}} avoid {{punishing}} the player for applying everyday logic in Maniac Mansion. Fox noted that one Sierra game features {{a scene in which}} the player, without prior warning, may encounter a game over screen simply by picking up a shard of glass. He characterized such game design as [...] "sadistic", and he commented, [...] "I know that in the real world <b>I</b> <b>can</b> successfully <b>pick</b> up a broken piece of mirror without dying". Because of the project's nonlinear puzzle design, the team struggled to prevent no-win scenarios, in which the player unexpectedly became unable to complete the game. As a result of this problem, Gilbert later explained, [...] "We were constantly fighting against the desire just to rip out all the endings and just go with three characters, or even sometimes just one character". Lucasfilm Games had only one playtester, and many dead-ends went undetected as a result. Further playtesting was provided by Gilbert's uncle, to whom Gilbert mailed a floppy disk of the game's latest version each week.|$|R

But <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> out the real from a scene like that as <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> out and throw away the seeds of an orange, and gazing o'er that enchanted scene I felt like the Knight of Snowdoun himself, when he first beheld the lake and said: ...|$|E

60|$|It {{has often}} set me {{thinking}} when I find that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> always <b>pick</b> up plenty of empty nuts under my shagbark-tree. The squirrels know {{them by their}} lightness, and I have seldom seen one with the marks of their teeth in it. What a school-house is the world, if our wits would only not play truant! For I observe that men set most store by forms and symbols in proportion as they are mere shells. It is the outside they want and not the kernel. What stores of such do not many, who in material things are as shrewd as the squirrels, lay up for the spiritual winter-supply {{of themselves and their}} children! I have seen churches that seemed to me garners of these withered nuts, for it is wonderful how prosaic is the apprehension of symbols by the minds of most men. It is not one sect nor another, but all, who, like the dog of the fable, have let drop the spiritual substance of symbols for their material shadow. If one attribute miraculous virtues to mere holy water, that beautiful emblem of inward purification at the door of God's house, another cannot comprehend the significance of baptism without being ducked over head and ears in the liquid vehicle thereof.|$|R
5000|$|... "The Pebble", or [...] "Le Galet", {{is easily}} the longest poem in the collection, being {{exceptionally}} {{long for the}} genre of prose poetry on the whole. To describe a pebble, Ponge starts at the beginning, literally, {{the beginning of time}} itself, diverging from his usual trend of descriptions and assertions. Instead, the reader gets a condensed cosmogony, describing the formation of the first rock, (the Earth, or however the reader wants to interpret it) as a sort of allegory of The Fall. Venturing through the [...] "expulsion of life", [...] "cooling", large tectonic plates, {{all the way down to}} the pebble itself, or the [...] "kind of stone that <b>I</b> Ponge <b>can</b> <b>pick</b> it up and turn it over in my hand", the pebble comes to stand for rock as a species or entity. The metaphor not to be missed in this poem is the stone as Time, where the [...] "great wheel of stone" [...] rolls ever on as [...] "plant life, animals, gases and liquids revolve quite rapidly in their cycles of dying". This then can be taken as Ponge's view of humanity, as he himself in an essay on [...] "The Pebble" [...] compares looking within himself to telling the story of the pebble. For Ponge, it is best to [...] "consider all things as unknown, and to ... begin again right from the beginning".|$|R

6000|$|But {{some light}} has been thrown on this {{question}} by an article, as charming as it is able, on [...] "The Physics of the Arctic Ice," [...] by Dr. Brown of Campster. You will {{find it in the}} [...] "Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society" [...] for February, 1870. He shows there that even in Greenland peaks and crags are left free enough from ice to support a vegetation of between three hundred or four hundred species of flowering plants; and, therefore, he well says, we must be careful to avoid concluding that the plant and animal life on the dreary shores or mountain-tops of the old glacial Scotland was poor. The same would hold good of our mountains; and, if so, we may look with respect, even awe, on the Alpine plants of Wales, Scotland, and the Lake mountains, as organisms, stunted it may be, and even degraded by their long battle with the elements, but venerable from their age, historic from their endurance. Relics of an older temperate world, they have lived through thousands of centuries of frost and fog, to sun themselves in a temperate climate once more. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> never <b>pick</b> one of them without a tinge of shame; and to exterminate one of them is to destroy, for the mere pleasure of collecting, the last of a family which God has taken the trouble to preserve for thousands of centuries.|$|R
