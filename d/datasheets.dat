5|$|Artists Mike Marsicano and Kurt Bickenbach played {{critical}} {{roles in}} the creation of the game's aircraft models, which were built in 3D Studio. As reference material, the team photographed real planes at several airfields, and they received blueprints and <b>datasheets</b> from aircraft manufacturers. The game's Grob G103a Twin II sailplane was based directly on the one that Blackley owned at the time. The sophistication of the real-time CFDs complicated the 3D modeling process, as the planes required accurate geometry to fly properly. While attempting to meet this goal, however, Bickenbach said that the models he created were overly detailed, which caused the team to struggle with performance issues related to the high number of polygons. Reducing the number altered the plane's shape, which in turn reduced its flight realism; this necessitated a balance between performance and accuracy. To obtain audio for the planes, Greg LoPiccolo and Tom Streit—former bassist and road manager, respectively, of the band Tribe—visited a Florida importer of Russian aerobatic aircraft. The two placed microphones inside the cockpits and next to the engines, and they flew each plane at multiple speeds while recording with a digital audio tape machine. Combining this material with digital recordings of wind sounds, the team fashioned a physics-based sound system: sounds of the wind and engine are altered in real-time based on wind speed in the game.|$|E

Examples of endurance cycle ratings listed in <b>datasheets</b> for NAND and NORflash, as well as in storage devices using flash memory, are provided.|$|E
25|$|The rated AC voltage {{for film}} {{capacitors}} is generally calculated so that an internal temperature rise of 8 to 10nbsp&°K is the allowed limit for safe operation. Because dielectric losses increase with increasing frequency, the specified AC voltage {{has to be}} derated at higher frequencies. <b>Datasheets</b> for film capacitors specify special curves for derating AC voltages at higher frequencies.|$|E
25|$|Absolute {{accuracy}} is {{the error of}} the measurement compared to a perfect measurement.

25|$|The {{impedance}} {{specified in}} the <b>datasheets</b> often show typical curves for the different capacitance values. With increasing frequency as the impedance decreases down to a minimum. The lower the impedance, the more easily alternating currents can be passed through the capacitor. At the apex, the point of resonance, where XC has the same value than XL, the capacitor has the lowest impedance value. Here only the ESR determines the impedance. With frequencies above the resonance the impedance increases again due to the ESL of the capacitor. The capacitor becomes an inductance.|$|E
