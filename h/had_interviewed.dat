5|$|Chaplin <b>had</b> <b>interviewed</b> several actresses to {{play the}} blind flower girl but was unimpressed with them all. While seeing a film shoot with bathing women in a Santa Monica beach, he found a casual acquaintance, Virginia Cherrill. Cherrill waved {{and asked if she}} would ever get the chance to work with him. After a series of poor auditions from other actresses, Chaplin {{eventually}} invited her to do a screen test. She was the first actress to subtly and convincingly act blind on camera due to her near-sightedness, and Cherrill signed a contract on November 1, 1928.|$|E

5|$|Krüger visited {{several other}} {{concentration}} camps {{to assemble the}} people he needed, primarily selecting those with skills in draftsmanship, engraving, printing and banking. In September 1942 the first 26 prisoners for Operation Bernhard arrived at Sachsenhausen; 80 more arrived in December. When met by Krüger, he called them in the formal and polite form , rather than the more demeaning , which was normally used when the Nazis spoke to a Jew. Several of the prisoners selected later reported that Krüger <b>had</b> <b>interviewed</b> them for the role, and treated them with politeness and good manners. He also provided the prisoners with cigarettes, newspapers, extra rations and a radio. Prisoners had a ping pong table, and they would play with the guards and among themselves; evenings of amateur theatricals also took place, staged by the prisoners, with a mixed audience of guards and counterfeiters; Krüger provided musicians for musical numbers.|$|E
5|$|Pickingill {{was brought}} to wider public {{attention}} in the early 1960s by the folklorist Eric Maple. As part of his research into beliefs regarding folk magic and witchcraft in nineteenth-century Essex, Maple <b>had</b> <b>interviewed</b> a number of Canewdon residents and collected their stories about Pickingill and {{his reputation as a}} cunning man. According to their accounts, Pickingill attracted visitors from around Essex seeking his magical help, for which he did not charge. They attributed to him the power to control animals, to command imps to do his bidding, and to wield power over either six or nine malevolent witches who lived in Canewdon. It was also claimed {{that he was able to}} coerce assistance and beer from local residents by threatening to place a curse upon them or their belongings. Although it has been suggested that local people were inventing claims to please Maple, many of which were based on older tales regarding the Essex cunning man James Murrell, subsequent research by historian Ronald Hutton has confirmed aspects of the folklorist's original accounts.|$|E

5|$|Several {{weeks after}} the {{departure}} of those assistants, reports began to surface that O'Brien <b>had</b> <b>interviewed</b> for the Houston Texans' head coaching position to replace Gary Kubiak, who was fired late in the season. Subsequently, the two sides were reported to be negotiating a contract, and on January 3, 2014, the Texans {{held a press conference}} announcing O'Brien as their new head coach. Assistant head coach and wide receivers coach Stan Hixon, safeties coach Anthony Midget, defensive coordinator John Butler, running backs coach Charles London, and strength coach Craig Fitzgerald submitted resignations on January 6, and most were expected to follow O'Brien to the NFL, leaving only offensive line coach Mac McWhorter, who was 63 years old and came out of retirement to coach at Penn State, defensive line coach Larry Johnson, a long-time member of the staff, and tight ends coach John Strollo, as assistant coaches on the staff, and thus making Penn State more attractive of a coaching position to a new coach, as he could bring in his own staff.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} of Rayon and Dr. Eve Saks were fictional; the writers <b>had</b> <b>interviewed</b> transgender AIDS patients, activists, and doctors {{for the film}} and combined these stories to create the two composite supporting roles. However, Woodroof did lose all his friends after they {{found out he was}} HIV-positive. In his interviews with Borten, Woodroof implied that this, along with interactions with gay people living with AIDS through the buyers club, led to a rethinking of his apparent anti-gay sentiments and changed his views on gay people. Other people who knew him said that he did not harbor anti-gay sentiments and was himself bisexual. Also, while a rodeo enthusiast, he never rode any bulls himself. Although the film shows Woodroof diagnosed in 1985, he told Borten that a doctor had informed him he might have had the disease well before that; Woodroof believed that he may have been infected in 1981, something that was briefly alluded to in a flashback in the film.|$|E

5|$|The prosecution's case {{continued}} on March 24. Inspector Cochran testified that Burton {{had attempted to}} discuss the case with him the day his indictment was made public. Cochran refused to discuss it. Reporter J.H. Aubere testified that he <b>had</b> <b>interviewed</b> Burton that day, and that Burton had denied practicing before the Post Office. Hector McRea, the Controller of Rialto, testified to a meeting between Mahaney and Burton, where Burton's representation was ended because the matter before the Post Office had concluded. Inspector Cochran was recalled to state that his conversation with Burton took place before Aubere's interview. Further, Cochran testified that, on February 5, 1902, Burton {{had told him that}} he wished to represent Rialto before the Department for a fee, having been assured by other Senators that such conduct was common and legal. Burton also told Cochran that he needed to repay a disputed debt of $70,000. Finally, Mahaney testified that, on the day he personally paid Burton $500, Burton advised Rialto to destroy its correspondence with him and that two such letters were destroyed. Thereafter, the prosecution rested.|$|E
5|$|The report {{published}} by the Tower Commission was delivered to the president on February 26, 1987. The Commission <b>had</b> <b>interviewed</b> 80 witnesses to the scheme, including Reagan, {{and two of the}} arms trade middlemen: Manucher Ghorbanifar and Adnan Khashoggi. The 200-page report was the most comprehensive of any released, criticizing the actions of Oliver North, John Poindexter, Caspar Weinberger, and others. It determined that President Reagan did not have knowledge of the extent of the program, especially about the diversion of funds to the Contras, although it argued that the president ought to have had better control of the National Security Council staff. The report heavily criticized Reagan for not properly supervising his subordinates or being aware of their actions. A major result of the Tower Commission was the consensus that Reagan should have listened to his National Security Advisor more, thereby placing more {{power in the hands of}} that chair.|$|E
