5|$|When Taft {{became chief}} justice, {{the court did}} not have its own {{building}} and met in the Capitol. Its offices were cluttered and overcrowded, but Fuller and White had been opposed to proposals to move the court to its own building. In 1925, Taft began a <b>fight</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the court a building, and two years later Congress appropriated money to purchase the land, {{on the south side of}} the Capitol. Cass Gilbert had prepared plans for the building, and was hired by the government as architect. Taft had hoped to live to see the court move into the new building, but it did not do so until 1935, after Taft's death.|$|E
5|$|With Gustave Bertrand's 1973 {{publication}} of his Enigma, substantial information {{about the origins of}} Ultra began to seep out; and with F. W. Winterbotham's 1974 best-seller, The Ultra Secret, the dam began to burst. Still, many aspiring authors were not averse to filling gaps in their information with whole-cloth fabrications. Rejewski fought a gallant (if, into the 21st century, not entirely successful) <b>fight</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the truth before the public. He published a number of papers on his cryptologic work and contributed generously to articles, books, and television programs. He was interviewed by scholars, journalists, and television crews from Poland, East Germany, the United States, Britain, Sweden, Belgium, the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and Brazil.|$|E

Because the long and tiring journey back to Weena's home is too much for them, they stop in the forest, and they are then overcome by Morlocks in the night, and Weena faints. The Traveller escapes when a small fire he had left behind them to distract the Morlocks catches up to them as a forest fire; Weena and the pursuing Morlocks are lost in the fire, and the Time Traveler is devastated over his loss.|$|E

500|$|... "Jump the Shark" [...] {{was written}} by Vince Gilligan, John Shiban, and Frank Spotnitz; it was {{directed}} by Cliff Bole. The episode proved difficult to make. After the cancellation of The Lone Gunmen television series, which aired in 2001, Fox reportedly [...] "hated [...] characters". Executive producer and co-writer Frank Spotnitz had to <b>fight</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the episode made; the studio informed Spotnitz {{that they did not}} want to bring the characters back in any capacity in the ninth season. Actor Bruce Harwood later explained that [...] "I think if the studio objected to anything, it was wasting time on our characters long enough to kill us off." [...] Co-writer Gilligan later recalled [...] "The Lone Gunmen was still kind of an open wound for me." [...] Thus, the episode was crafted as a way to wrap up the series. Due to the nature of the episode—which effectively works as a tie-in—various long-term characters from both The X-Files and The Lone Gunmen make cameo appearances.|$|E

When Lucas returns, Maya's life is turns [...] "upside down," [...] and she is angry at him because she feels betrayed by him. Armitage stated that Lucas was [...] "just compelled to see her" [...] after looking at photographs of them both together, and really shapes his future. Both characters go on [...] "quite an interesting journey" [...] because Maya moved on with her life without Lucas, and he has to <b>fight</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> her to listen to him. However, when they start to restart their relationship, Vaughn gets in the way and [...] "throws water over it." [...] Rouass believes that Lucas [...] "definitely" [...] trusts Maya without question, and that their relationship is [...] "dynamic and explosive" [...] and makes them [...] "question certain things." [...] Neither of them can control their relationship, which scares Maya. Iain Glen believed that Maya is also Lucas' central weakness, and his love for her becomes instrumental to his downfall.|$|E

Morton noted that although [...] "Madonna's comic talent was acknowledged, cinemagoers in the United States stayed away in droves." [...] The film was better accepted in the foreign released territories, prompting Madonna to defend herself, rather weakly, that her ideas were better accepted in Europe and Japan, rather than her home country. She added, [...] "I think the movie did badly in America because I upstaged it with my tour. People were confused about the connection between the record, the tour and the movie because they all had the same title. I also think there are people who don't want me to do well in both fields. I had to really <b>fight</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> any respect from the music business and now I guess {{there are some people who}} feel that I ought to be grateful for that respect and stick to music." [...] Nevertheless, Warner Bros. decided to release the film in home media in VHS on November 11, 1987, a decision not approved by Madonna.|$|E
