40|$|The “methane-led hypotheses” {{assume that}} gas {{hydrates}} and marine seeps are the sole geologic factors controlling Quaternary atmospheric and climate changes. Nevertheless, a wider class of geologic sources of methane exist {{which could have}} played a role in past climate changes. Beyond offshore seepage, relevant geologic emissions of methane (GEM) are from onshore seepage, including mud volcanism, microseepage and geothermal flux; altogether GEM are the second most important natural source of atmospheric methane at present. The amount of methane entering the atmosphere from onshore GEM seems to prevail on that from offshore seepage. Onshore sources inject a predominantly isotopically heavy (13 C-enriched) methane into the atmosphere. They are controlled mainly by endogenic (geodynamic) processes, which induce large-scale gas flow variations over geologic and millennial time scales, and only partially by exogenic (surface) conditions, so that they are not affected by negative feedbacks. The eventual influence on atmospheric methane concentration does not necessarily require catastrophic or abrupt releases, as proposed for the “clathrate gun hypothesis”. Enhanced degassing from these sources could have contributed to the methane trends observed in the ice core records, and could explain the late Quaternary peaks of increased methane concentrations accompanied by the enrichment of isotopically <b>heavy</b> <b>methane,</b> as recently observed. This hypothesis shall be tested by means of robust multidisciplinary studies, mainly based on a series of atmospheric, biologic and geologic proxies...|$|E
40|$|Presented is a {{detailed}} comparison of CH 4 and δ 13 C–CH 4 measurements with simulations {{of the global}} transport model TM 3. Experimental data were obtained during campaigns along the Trans-Siberian railroad {{in the framework of}} the TROICA project. Two summer (1999 and 2001) and one spring (2003) expeditions are evaluated. Model simulations include sensitivity tests to further investigate the isotopic composition of natural gas and emissions from Siberian wetlands. Comparison of the average mixing ratio of methane and its isotopic composition (δ 13 C) has been performed for different geographic zones, including the European part of Russia, Western Siberia and Central Siberia. Simulations are in reasonable agreement with the measurements for the European part of Russia and confirm a high contribution of natural gas to the observed methane levels. An increase of emission from bogs shifts the simulated methane isotopic composition closer to the observations. The relative importance of the Western Siberia emissions in current inventories is underestimated in comparison with other wetland regions in the former USSR. Simulated average mixing ratios are in a good agreement with the observations in Central Siberia, while 13 C(CH 4) values tend to be higher than measured in all considered scenarios. These results point to a bias in the modeled source mixture over Russia, which could be repaired by shifting emissions from isotopically <b>heavy</b> <b>methane</b> sources (e. g. coal, oil or biomass burning) to light sources (e. g. wetlands, ruminants, waste treatment). Alternatively, the average isotopic signature of Siberian wetlands may be lighter than expected...|$|E

Pressure generally retards oil cracking, as evidenced by reduced gas yields, but the trends depend upon the level of thermal evolution. In {{the early stages of}} cracking (350 and 373 °C, equivalent vitrinite reflectance of 1. 3 % R 0), pressure still has a strong suppression effect from 200 to 470 bar, which then levels off or is reversed as the pressure is increased further to 750 and 900 bar. Interestingly, the stable carbon isotopic composition of the generated methane becomes enriched in 13 C as the pressure increases from 200 to 900 bar. A maximum fractionation effect of ∼ 3 ‰ is observed over this pressure range. Due to pressure retardation, the isotopically <b>heaviest</b> <b>methane</b> signature does not coincide with the maximum gas yield, contrary to what might be expected. In contrast, pressure has little effect on ethane, propane, and butane carbon isotope ratios, which show a maximum variation of ∼ 1 ‰. The results suggest that the rates of methane-forming reactions affected by pressure control methane carbon isotope fractionation. Based on distinctive carbon isotope patterns of methane and wet gases from pressurized oil cracking, a conceptual model using “natural gas plot” is constructed to identify pressure effect on in situ oil cracking providing other factors excluded.

The published article is copyrighted by Elsevier {{and can be found}} at: [URL] present a kinetic model based upon pore water data collected from eight sites drilled during the second Ulleung Basin gas hydrate drilling expedition (UBGH 2) in 2010. Three sites were drilled at locations where acoustic chimneys were identified in seismic data, and the rest were drilled on non-chimney (i. e. background) environments. Our model, coupled a comprehensive compositional and isotopic data set, is used to illustrate the different biogeochemical processes at play in those two environments, in terms of reactions around the sulfate-methane-transition-zone (SMTZ). Organic matter decomposition is an important process for production of methane, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and consumption of sulfate in the non-chimney sites, whereas anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) dominates both carbon and sulfur cycles in the chimney environment. Different sources of methane mediate AOM in the two settings. Internally produced methane through CO₂ reduction (CR) and methanogenesis fuels AOM in the non-chimney sites, whereas AOM is sustained by methane from external sources in the chimney sites. We also simulate the system evolution from non-chimney to chimney conditions by increasing the bottom methane supply to a non-chimney setting. We show that the higher CH₄ flux leads to a higher microbial activity of AOM, and more organic matter decomposition through methanogenesis. A higher methanogenesis rate and a smaller CR contribution relative to AOM in the chimney sites is responsible for the isotopically light DIC and <b>heavy</b> <b>methane</b> in this environment, relative to the non-chimney sites...|$|E

In the Weiyuan gas field, the principal gas reservoirs belong to Sinian Dengying Fm. The natural gas is mainly composed of methane, with slight ethane and trace propane. The gas reservoirs are higher in water saturation, with well preserved primary water. Then, it was discriminated from the relationship of H 2 S content vs. methane carbon isotope that the heavier methane carbon isotope of natural gas in this area is not caused by thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR).

40|$|As methane is {{consumed}} in the deep sea, its (13) C/(12) C ratio progressively increases because of kinetic isotope fractionation. Many submarine hydrothermal vents emit methane with carbon isotope ratios that are {{higher than those of}} background methane in the surrounding ocean. Since the latter exists at low concentrations, mixing of background methane with vent fluid tends to decrease the (13) C/(12) C ratio as concentration decreases, opposite to the trend produced by consumption. We investigated CH(4) concentration and delta(13) C together with delta(3) He in plumes from the Logatchev hydrothermal field (LHF) located at 14 degrees 45 'N, 45 degrees W, which generates relatively <b>heavy</b> <b>methane</b> (delta(13) C approximate to - 13 parts per thousand) by serpentinization of ultramafic rock. The measured methane and delta(3) He were well correlated at high concentrations, indicating a CH(4) /(3) He ratio of 1 x 10 (8) in the vent fluids. These tracer distributions were also simulated with an advection-diffusion model in which methane consumption only occurs above a certain threshold concentration. We utilized delta(3) He to calculate the methane remaining in solution after oxidation, f, and the deviation of delta(13) C from the value expected from mixing alone, Delta delta(13) C. Both in the model and in the data, the entire set of Delta delta(13) C values are not correlated with log f, which is due to continuous oxidation within the plume while mixing with background seawater. A linear relationship, however, is found in the model for methane at concentrations sufficiently above background, and many of the samples with elevated CH 4 north of LHF exhibit a linear trend of Delta delta(13) C versus log f as well. From this trend, the kinetic isotope fractionation factor in the LHF plumes appears to be about 1. 015. This value is somewhat higher than found in some other deep-sea studies, but it is lower than found in laboratory incubation experiments...|$|E
40|$|Shear-coaxial {{injector}} {{elements are}} often used in liquid-propellant-rocket thrust chambers, where combustion instabilities remain a significant problem. A conventional solution to the combustion instability problem relies on passive control techniques that use empirically-tested hardware such as acoustic baffles and tuned cavities. In addition to adding weight and decreasing engine performance, these devices are designd using trial-and-error empirical science, which does not provide the capability to predict the overall system stability characteristics in advance. In this thesis, two novel control strategies {{that are based on}} propellant fluid dynamics were investigated for mitigating acoustic instability involving shear-coaxial injector elements. The new control strategies would use a set of controlled injectors allowing local adjustment of propellant flow patterns for each operating condition, of which the instability could become a problem. One strategy relies on reducing the oxidizer-fuel density gradient by blending <b>heavier</b> <b>methane</b> to the main fuel hydrogen. Another strategy utilizes modifying the equivalence ratio to affect the acoustic impedance through the mixing and reaction rate changes. To provide the scientific basis, unit-physics experiments were conducted to explore the potential effectiveness of these strategies. Two different model combustors, simulating a single-element injector test and a double-element injector test, were designed and tested for flame-acoustic interaction. For these experiments, the Reynolds number of the central oxygen jet was kept between 4700 and 5500 making the injector flames sufficiently turbulent. A compression driver, mounted {{on one side of the}} combustor wall, provided controlled acoustic excitation to the injector flames, simulating the initial phase of flame-acoustic interaction. Acoustic excitation was applied either as a band-limited white noise forcing between 100 Hz and 5000 Hz or as a single-frequency, fixed-amplitude forcing at 1150 Hz which represented a frequency least amplified by any resonance. Effects of each control strategy on flame-acoustic interaction were assessed in terms of modifying the acoustic resonance characteristics subject to white-noise excitation and changes in flame brush thickness under single-frequency excitation. In the methane blending experiments, the methane mole fraction was varied between 0 % and 63 %. Under white noise excitation, up to 16 % shift in a resonant frequency was observed but the acoustic pressure spectrum remained qualitatively similar. For the fixed frequency forcing, the spatial extent of flame-acoustic interaction was substantially reduced. In the other experiments, the equivalence ratio of the control injector was varied between 0 and infinity, causing up to 40 % shift in a resonant frequency as well as changes in the acoustic pressure spectrum. These results open up the possibility of employing flow-based control to prevent combustion instabilities in liquid-fueled rockets...|$|R

Wherever sulfate concentrations approach or equal zero, methane concentrations increase rapidly, reaching values near 100, 000 µL/L of wet sediment at eight of the 10 sites.

40|$|Methane (CH 4) is {{the second}} most {{important}} greenhouse gas emitted by human activities in the Earth’s atmosphere. Although it is roughly 200 times less abundant than carbon dioxide, it is a 28 times more potent greenhouse gas. Approximately one fifth of the changes in the Earth’s balance energy caused by human-linked greenhouse gases since the beginning of industrialization (~ 1750) is due to methane. Methane is emitted by both natural sources and human activities. Indeed, methane can be emitted to the atmosphere through coal mining, oil and gas exploitation, rice cultures, domestic ruminant animals, biomass burning, waste management, wetlands, termites, methane hydrates and ocean. In the atmosphere, methane is mainly destroyed by the radical hydroxyl, also called the detergent of the atmosphere, and therefore plays a major role on the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere. Since the beginning of the industrialization, atmospheric methane concentrations have increased by 260 % to reach 1824 pbb in 2013. From the 1980 s until the beginning of the 1990 s, atmospheric methane was significantly on the rise, then stabilized during 1999 - 2006 to rise again afterwards. To this day, the source or sink responsible of this latter increase remains unexplained. Through each emission process, heavy molecules of methane (with one additional neutron either on a carbon or on one hydrogen atom) are emitted along methane (12 CH 4). The main heavy molecules of methane, called isotopologues (13 CH 4 and CH 3 D), are respectively ~ 110 and ~ 60 000 times less abundant than methane. Despite their small abundances, they give crucial information on the concentration of methane in the atmosphere and its evolution. Indeed, both isotopologues are emitted with specific emission ratio depending on the emission sources. Determining isotopic ratio of atmospheric methane is therefore a unique tracer of its budget. While the non-monotonous trend of methane is subject of an extensive number of studies, to our knowledge, no study of the isotopic ratio of methane derived from ground-based solar observations has been published to date.

40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} {{the value of}} targeted pump and treatment (PAT) to enhance the in situ biodegradation of organic contaminants in groundwater for improved restoration. The approach is illustrated for a plume of phenolic compounds in a sandstone aquifer, where PAT is used for hydraulic containment and removal of dissolved phase contaminants from specific depth intervals. Time-series analysis of the plume hydrochemistry and stable isotope composition of dissolved species (δ 34 S-SO 4, δ 13 C-CH 4, δ 13 C-TDIC (TDIC=Total Dissolved Inorganic Carbon)) in groundwater samples from high-resolution multilevel samplers were used to deduce changes in the relative significance of biodegradation processes and microbial activity in the plume, induced by the PAT system over 3 years. The PAT system has reduced the maximum contaminant concentrations (up to 6800 mgL- 1 total phenols) in the plume by 50 % to ~ 70 % at different locations. This intervention has (i) stimulated in situ biodegradation in general, with an approximate doubling of contaminant turnover based on TDIC concentration, which has increased from 350 mgL- 1, (ii) enhanced the activity of SO 4 -reducing microorganisms (marked by a declining SO 4 concentration with corresponding increase in SO 4 -δ 34 S to values > 7 - 14 ‰V-CDT relative to background values of 1. 9 - 6. 5 ‰V-CDT), and (iii) where the TDIC increase is greatest, has changed TDIC-δ 13 C from values of - 10 to - 15 ‰V-PDB to ~- 20 ‰V-PDB. This indicates {{an increase in the}} relative importance of respiration processes (including denitrification and anaerobic methane oxidation, AMO) that yield 13 C-depleted TDIC over fermentation and acetoclastic methanogenesis that yield 13 C-enriched TDIC in the plume, leading to higher contaminant turnover. The plume fringe was found to be a zone of enhanced biodegradation by SO 4 -reduction and methanogenesis. Isotopically <b>heavy</b> <b>methane</b> compositions (up to - 47. 8 ‰V-PDB) and trends between δ 13 C-TDIC and δ 13 C-CH 4 suggest that AMO occurs at the plume fringe where the contaminant concentrations have been reduced by the PAT system. Mass and isotope balances for inorganic carbon in the plume confirm the shift in spatial dominance of different biodegradation processes and significant increase in contribution of anaerobic respiration for contaminant biodegradation in zones targeted by the PAT system. The enhanced in situ biodegradation results from a reduction in organic contaminant concentrations in the plume to levels below those that formerly suppressed microbial activity, combined with increased supply of soluble electron acceptors (e. g. nitrate) into the plume by dispersion. An interruption of the PAT system and recovery of the dissolved organic contaminant concentrations towards former values highlights the dynamic nature of this enhancement on restoration and relatively rapid response of the aquifer microorganisms to changing conditions induced by the PAT system. In situ restoration using this combined engineered and passive approach has the potential to manage plumes of biodegradable contaminants over shorter timescales than would be possible using these methods independently. The application of PAT in this way strongly depends on the ability to ensure an adequate flux of dissolved electron acceptors into the plume by advection and dispersion, particularly in heterogeneous aquifers...|$|E

In the Santa Barbara Channel, California, three widely differing seeps (depth, flux, oiliness) were visited and observations were made of seep gas partial pressures, Pi, near the surface for alkanes to n = 5 (pentane) as well as major atmospheric gases, and upwelling flows.

A numerical model was developed to study the sensitivity to environmental parameters of the bubble transport of seep gas to the surface.

The model predicted that upwelling flows were increased bubble survivability and transport to the surface. It was also predicted that dissolved methane concentrations higher than 0. 01 atm increased bubble survivability.

A firn air transport model was applied to reconstruct past atmospheric trends in methane and its isotopic composition. By subsequent application of an atmospheric model, changes in methane sources and OH sink compatible with the past atmospheric trends are explored. In step with increasing methane mixing ratios, δ 13 C increased by ∼ 1. 7 ‰ 0 over the last 50 years. These changes mainly reflect a shift in relative source strength toward the <b>heavier</b> anthropogenic <b>methane</b> source, such as biomass burning and methane of nonbiological origin. The δD (CH 4) showed a period of decline between the 1950 s and 1975, followed by a gradual increase of 0. 55 ‰/yr, also toward the heavier anthropogenic source. Dependent on possible changes in the OH sink, to which δD of methane is very sensitive, the inferred isotopic trends of δ 13 C and δD over the last 50 years constrain the relationship between natural and anthropogenic sources over the last century. The observed δD minimum around 1975 suggests that the slowing down in the methane source growth took place during this period. ...|$|R

For the theoretical analysis of this phenomenon, a general, first-principles equation of state has been developed by extending scaled particle theory and by using the technique of the factored partition function of the simplified perturbed hard-chain theory. The chemical potentials and the respective thermodynamic Affinity have been calculated for typical components of the H–C system over a range of pressures between 1 and 100 kbar (1 kbar = 100 MPa) and at temperatures {{consistent with those of}} the depths of the Earth at such pressures. The theoretical analyses establish that the normal alkanes, the homologous hydrocarbon group of lowest chemical potential, evolve only at pressures greater than ≈ 30 kbar, excepting only the lightest, methane.

For experimental verification of the predictions of the theoretical analysis, a special high-pressure apparatus has been designed that permits investigations at pressures to 50 kbar and temperatures to 1, 500 °C and also allows rapid cooling while maintaining high pressures.

This methane anomaly extended from its centre on the shelf westwards over the upper slope and eastwards well into the inner basins of the two southernmost Spitsbergen fjords, the Hornsundfjord and the van Mijenfjord. Methane concentrations and stable carbon isotopic ratios varied between 2 and 240 nM, and between - 53 per mill and - 20 per mill VPDB, respectively. Methane in high concentrations was depleted in 13 C whereas in low concentrations d 13 CCH 4 values were highly variable. On the continental shelf we found that methane discharged from seeps on top of sandy and gravelly banks is isotopically <b>heavier</b> than <b>methane</b> escaping from troughs filled with silty and clayey sediments. These distinct isotopic signatures suggest that methane is gently released from several inter-granular seepages or micro-seepages widely spread over the shelf. A potential migration path for thermogenic or hydrate methane may be the Hornsund Fracture Zone, a south-north running reactivated fault system created by stretching of the continental crust. After discharge into the water column, local water currents fed by Atlantic water, coastal water, and freshwater outflows from the fjords further determine pathways and fate of the methane. We used d 18 Owater and 222 Rn data to trace origin and advection of the local water masses and water mixing processes. Methane spreads predominantly along pycnoclines and by vertical mixing.

To evaluate the effects of two contrasting hydrothermal environments on the antioxidant defence system of this vent mussel species, a 2 -week transplant experiment was carried out involving mussels collected from the relatively deep (2300 m), and chemical rich, Rainbow vent field. These were transplanted to the shallower (1700 m), and relatively less toxic, Lucky Strike vent field. To achieve this objective, levels of superoxide dismutase, catalase (CAT), total glutathione peroxidase (GPx), selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase and lipid peroxidation (LPO) were measured in the gills and mantle tissues of resident and transplant mussels {{before and after the}} transplant experiment. With the exception of CAT, the gills of the transplanted mussels had significantly higher antioxidant enzyme activity compared with the basal levels in the donor (Rainbow) and recipient (Lucky Strike) populations; whereas the antioxidant enzyme levels in the mantle tissues of the transplants reflected the baseline levels of activity in the native Lucky Strike mussels after 2 weeks. In contrast, LPO levels were significantly higher in both tissue types in the transplants than in either the source or the recipient populations, which suggested a response to hydrostatic pressure change (note, the transplant animals were brought to the surface for transportation between the two vent fields).

Our results from qPCR demonstrated a general pattern of gene expression, decreasing from 12 h over 24 h post-infection. Among the bacteria tested, Flavobacterium is the bacterium inducing the highest gene expression level in 12 h post-infections animals. The 24 h infected animals revealed, however, greater gene expression levels, using V. splendidus as the infectious agent. The SDS-PAGE analysis also pointed at protein profile differences between 12 h and 24 h, particularly evident for proteins of 18 – 20 KDa molecular mass, where most dissimilarity was found. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that immune genes, as well as experimental infections, clustered in discrete groups in accordance with the gene expression patterns induced by bacterial pathogens...|$|R
40|$|Pre-reformer is a {{catalytic}} reactor which {{is useful for}} reformation reaction of natural in gas cracking reaction of heavy hydrocarbons. This research aimed to study the effect of Rhodium Catalyst for cracking <b>heavy</b> hydrocarbons into <b>methane</b> in the pre-reformer to increase the conversion of methane to syngas in Pusri II and to know the impact of additional pre-reformer at Pusri II against the feed gas composition, thermal efficiency and fuel consumption in primary reformer. The {{results showed that the}} use of rhodium as a catalyst in the reaction of the pre-reformer can crack heavy hydrocarbons like ethane, propane and butane to methane in a row at 71. 9 %, 88. 2 % and 88. 2 % and methane reformation reaction with steam to produce hydrogen gas amd carbon monoxide at 24. 9 %. Installation of pre-reformer feed gas can alter the composition of the primary reformer and the methane conversion increased to 42. 94 % from 24. 73 % at a temperature of 973 K. Installation of pre-reformer can reduce fuel consumption of 97. 74 x 1010 MMBtu/hr and an increase thermal efficiency of 13. 28 % in the primary reformer...|$|R
40|$|The {{surface of}} Titan has been {{revealed}} globally by the Cassini observations {{in the infrared}} and radar wavelength ranges as well as locally by the Huygens instruments. Sand seas, recently discovered lakes, distinct landscapes and dendritic erosion pattern indicate dynamic surface processes. During Cassini’s T 20 flyby the Visible and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) [1] observed an extremely eroded area at 30 ° W, 7 ° S with resolution better than 350 m. Analyses of the drainage dynamics and comparison with the drainage systems at the Huygens landing site yield high discharge values of the associated channel systems and extreme runoff production rates of 10 to 50 cm/day. In addition, large sandur-like alluvial fans covering ten thousands of square kilometres are discovered at the boundary between high-standing bright and low-laying dark regions. To account for the estimated runoff production and widespread alluvial fan deposits of fine-grained material both frequent recurrence intervals and sudden release of areadependent large fluid volumes are required. Frequent equatorial storms with <b>heavy</b> rainfall of <b>methane</b> and related hydrocarbons might explain this catastrophic erosion. High-energy flow will cause mechanical weathering and large accumulations of sand in alluvial fans that is picked up by winds to form Titan’s vast equatorial sand seas and dune fields...|$|R
40|$|Research efforts {{during this}} quarter {{concentrated}} on two issues. The first issue {{is related to}} the chemistry of oxygen conducting materials that could be used as dense membranes in the membrane reactors. Mixed oxides of La, Sr, Fe, Ce, Yb etc., were synthesized, characterized and studied for their catalytic activity towards the oxidative coupling of <b>methane.</b> <b>Heavy</b> metal oxides of lanthanum, strontium and iron, which form good oxygen conductors, showed very poor methane coupling activity. Perovskites of the Strontium-Cerium-Yitribium series showed moderate activity for methane coupling. These could be potential candidates for dense membrane synthesis, since they also have moderate oxygen conduction properties. The second area of research focus was the development of a radial flow catalytic membrane reactor in which methane coupling was carried out over a catalyst that was deposited inside the pores of a ceramic porous membrane. Catalytic results from the high temperature oxidative coupling of methane in these radial flow membrane reactors are presented in this report. By exploring the reactor performance in membranes of pore diameters of 2. 0 {mu}m, 0. 2 {mu}m, and 0. 02 {mu}m, the effect of the diffusional regime on the methane. coupling activity was demonstrated. The smallest pore diameter membranes exhibited lowest hydrocarbon selectivities...|$|R
40|$|Flow {{characteristics}} in small coflow diffusion flames were investigated {{with a particular}} focus on the near-nozzle region and on the buoyancy force exerted on fuels with densities lighter and <b>heavier</b> than air (<b>methane,</b> ethylene, propane, and n-butane). The flow-fields were visualized through the trajectories of seed particles. The particle image velocimetry technique was also adopted for quantitative velocity field measurements. The {{results showed that the}} buoyancy force exerted on the fuel as well as on burnt gas significantly distorted the near-nozzle flow-fields. In the fuels with densities heavier than air, recirculation zones were formed very close to the nozzle, emphasizing the importance of the relative density of the fuel to that of the air on the flow-field. Nozzle heating influenced the near-nozzle flow-field particularly among lighter fuels (methane and ethylene). Numerical simulations were also conducted, focusing specifically on the effect of specifying inlet boundary conditions for fuel. The results showed that a fuel inlet boundary with a fully developed velocity profile for cases with long tubes should be specified inside the fuel tube to permit satisfactory prediction of the flow-field. The calculated temperature fields also indicated the importance of the selection of the location of the inlet boundary, especially in testing various combustion models that include soot in small coflow diffusion flames. © 2014 The Combustion Institute...|$|R
40|$|Three geochemical {{surveys of}} soil gas (CO 2 and CH 4 flux measurements, He, H 2, CO 2, CH 4 and C 2 H 6 concentrations) and isotopic {{analyses}} (δ 13 C–CH 4, δD–CH 4, δ 13 C–CO 2) {{were carried out}} {{as part of a}} feasibility study for a natural gas storage site in the Modena Province (Northern Italy), during the 2006 - 2009 period. In May-June 2012, a seismic sequence (main shocks of ML 5. 9 and 5. 8) was occurred closely to the investigated area. Chemical and isotopic analysis were repeated in May 2012, September 2012, June 2013 and July 2014. In the 2006 - 2009 period, at the pre-seismic conditions, chemical composition of soil gas showed that {{the southern part of the}} studied area is CH 4 -dominated, whereas the northern part is CO 2 -dominated. Relatively anomalous fluxes and concentrations were recorded with a spotted areal distribution. Anyway, CO 2 and CH 4 values are within the typical range of vegetative and of organic exhalation of the cultivated soil. 2012 - 2013 soil gas results show CO 2 values essentially unvaried with respect to pre-earthquake surveys, while the 2014 values highlight an increasing of CO 2 flux in the whole study area. On the contrary, CH 4 values seem to be on average higher after the seismic sequence, although with a decreasing trend in the last survey (2014). Isotopic analysis were carried out only on samples with anomalous values. The δ 13 C-CO 2 value suggests a prevalent shallow origin of CO 2 (i. e. organic and/or soil-derived) probably related to anaerobic oxidation of <b>heavy</b> hydrocarbons. <b>Methane</b> isotopic data (δ 13 C-CH 4) indicate a typical biogenic origin (i. e. microbial hydrocarbon production) of the CH 4, as recognized elsewhere in the Po Plain and surroundings. Obtained results highlight a different CO 2 and CH 4 behaviour before, during and after the seismic events. These variations could be produced by increasing of bacterial (e. g. peat strata) and methanogenic fermentation processes in the first meters of the soil. No hints of deep degassing can be inferred for the study area after the earthquake, as suggested by isotopic analysis. These achieved outcomes constitute the starting point for subsequent geochemical surveys, in order to assess the temporal variations and to better understand the geochemical processes related to the seismic sequence...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{build-up}} {{of methane}} in the hypolimnion of the eutrophic Lake Rotsee (Lucerne, Switzerland) was monitored over a full year. Sources and sinks of methane {{in the water}} column were characterized by measuring concentrations and carbon isotopic composition. In fall, high methane concentrations (up to 1 mM) were measured in the anoxic water layer. In the oxic layer, methane concentrations were much lower and the isotopic composition shifted towards <b>heavy</b> carbon isotopes. <b>Methane</b> oxidation rates peaked at the interface between oxic and anoxic water layers at around 8 - 10 m depth. The electron balance between the oxidants oxygen, sulphate, and nitrate, and the reductants methane, sulphide and ammonium, matched very well in the chemocline during the stratified season. The profile of carbon isotopic composition of methane showed strong indications for methane oxidation at the chemocline (including the oxycline). Aerobic methane oxidizing bacteria were detected at the interface using fluorescence in situ hybridization. Sequencing the responsible organisms from DGGE bands revealed that aerobic methanotrophs type I closely related to Methylomonas were present. Sulphate consumption occurred at the sediment surface and, only {{towards the end of the}} stagnation period, matched with a zone of methane consumption. In any case, the flux of sulphate below the chemocline was not sufficient to oxidize all the methane and other oxidants like nitrate, iron or manganese are necessary for the observed methane oxidation. Although most of the methane was oxidized either aerobically or anaerobically, Lake Rotsee was still a source of methane to the atmosphere with emission rates between 0. 2 mg CH(4) m(- 2) day(- 1) in February and 7 mg CH(4) m(- 2) day(- 1) in November...|$|R
40|$|Crude {{oil in the}} West Dikirnis {{field in}} the {{northern}} onshore Nile Delta, Egypt, occurs in the poorly-sorted Miocene sandstones of the Qawasim Formation. The geochemical composition and source of this oil is investigated in this paper. The reservoir sandstones are overlain by mudstones in {{the upper part of}} the Qawasim Formation and in the overlying Pliocene Kafr El-Sheikh Formation. However TOC and Rock-Eval analyses of these mudstones indicate that they have little potential to generate hydrocarbons, and mudstone extracts show little similarity in terms of biomarker compositions to the reservoired oils. The oils at West Dikirnis are interpreted to have been derived from an Upper Cretaceous [...] Lower Tertiary terrigenous, clay-rich source rock, and to have migrated up along steeply-dipping faults to the Qawasim sandstones reservoir. This interpretation is supported by the high C 29 /C 27 sterane, diasterane/sterane, hopane/sterane and oleanane/C 30 hopane ratios in the oils. Biomarker-based maturity indicators (Ts/Tm, moretanes/hopanes and C 32 homohopanes S/S+R) suggest that oil expulsion occurred before the source rock reached peak maturity. Previous studies have shown that the Upper Cretaceous – Lower Tertiary source rock is widely distributed throughout the on- and offshore Nile Delta. A wet gas sample from the Messinian sandstones at El-Tamad field, located near to West Dikirnis, was analysed to determine its molecular and isotopic composition. The presence of isotopically <b>heavy</b> d 13 <b>methane,</b> ethane and propane indicates a thermogenic origin for the gas which was cracked directly from a humic kerogen. A preliminary burial and thermal history model suggests that wet gas window maturities in the study area occur within the Jurassic succession, and the gas at El-Tamad may therefore be derived from a source rock of Jurassic age...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{polymeric}} membranes {{for natural}} gas separation has rapidly increased {{during the past three}} decades, particularly for carbon dioxide separation from natural gas. Another valuable application is the separation of <b>heavy</b> hydrocarbons from <b>methane</b> (fuel gas conditioning), more importantly for remote area and off-shore applications. A new potential polymeric membrane that might be utilized {{for natural gas}} separations is a Tröger’s base ladder polymer (PIM-Trip-TB- 2). This glassy polymeric membrane was synthesized by the polymerization reaction of 9, 10 -dimethyl- 2, 6 (7) diaminotriptycene with dimethoxymethane. In this research, the polymer was selected due to its high surface area and highly interconnected microporous structure. Sorption isotherms of nitrogen (N 2), oxygen (O¬ 2), methane (CH 4), carbon dioxide (CO 2), ethane (C 2 H 6), propane (C 3 H 8), and n-butane (n-C 4 H 10) were measured at 35 °C over a range of pressures using a Hiden Intelligent Gravimetric Analyzer, IGA. The more condensable gases (C 2 H 6, CO 2, C 3 H 8, and n-C 4 H 10) showed high solubility due to their high affinity to the polymer matrix. The permeation coefficients were determined for various gases at 35 °C and pressure difference of 5 bar via the constant-pressure/variable-volume method. The PIM-Trip-TB- 2 film exhibited high performance for several high-impact applications, such as O 2 /N 2, H 2 /N 2 and H 2 /CH 4. Also, physical aging for several gases was examined by measuring the permeability coefficients at different periods of time. Moreover, a series of mixed-gas permeation tests was performed using 2 vol. % n-C 4 H 10 / 98 vol. % CH 4 and the results showed similar transport characteristics to other microporous polymers with pores of less than 2 nm. The work performed in this research suggested that PIM-Trip-TB- 2 is suitable for the separation of: (i) higher hydrocarbons from methane and (ii) small, non-condensable gases such as O 2 /N 2 and H 2 /CH 4...|$|R
