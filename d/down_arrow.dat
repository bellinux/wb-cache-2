500|$|Spin can be {{represented}} by a vector whose length is measured in units of the reduced Planck constant ħ (pronounced [...] "h bar"). For quarks, a measurement of the spin vector component along any axis can only yield the values +ħ/2 or −ħ/2; for this reason quarks are classified as spin- particles. The component of spin along a given axis – by convention the z axis – is often denoted by an up arrow ↑ for the value + and <b>down</b> <b>arrow</b> ↓ for the value −, placed after the symbol for flavor. For example, an up quark with a spin of + along the z axis is denoted by u↑.|$|E
500|$|The Start screen {{received}} several enhancements on Windows 8.1, including an extended [...] "All Apps" [...] view with sort modes (accessed by clicking a new <b>down</b> <b>arrow</b> button or swiping upward), small and extra-large sizes for tiles, and colored tiles for desktop program shortcuts. Additional customization options were also added, such as expanded color options, new backgrounds (some of which incorporate animated elements), {{and the ability}} for the Start screen to use the desktop background instead. Applications are no longer added to the Start screen automatically when installed, and all applications now have colored tiles (desktop programs were previously shown in a single color). The app snapping system has also been extended; up to four apps can be snapped onto a single display depending on screen size, apps can be snapped to fill half the screen, and {{can also be used}} on any display in a multi-monitor configuration. Apps can also launch other apps in a snapped view to display content; for example, the Mail app can open a photo attachment in a picture viewer snapped to another half of the screen. Improved support is also provided by apps for using devices in a portrait (vertical) orientation. The lock screen offers the ability to use a photo slideshow as its backdrop, and a shortcut to the Camera app by swiping up. The on-screen keyboard has an improved autocomplete mechanism which displays multiple word suggestions, and allows users to select from them by sliding on the spacebar. The autocomplete dictionary is also automatically updated using data from Bing, allowing it to recognize and suggest words relating to current trends and events. Similarly to Windows Phone, certain apps now display a narrow bar with three dots on it to indicate the presence of a pop-up menu accessible by swiping, clicking on the dots, or right-clicking.|$|E
500|$|DJ Hero {{primarily}} simulates turntablism, {{a musical}} style used by disc jockeys {{to create a}} new mashup song by incorporating one or more previously recorded songs played on record players along with sound effect generators. The game features score attack gameplay similar to the Guitar Hero games. The controller consists of a wireless deck consisting of a movable turntable that supports 3 [...] "stream" [...] buttons, an effects dial, a crossfader, and a [...] "Euphoria" [...] button; a hidden panel contains additional controller buttons to interact with the gaming console outside of the game. A portion of the controller can be detached and reattached to adapt the unit for left-handed players. Notes travel in an arc across a spinning record on screen, and the player holds down one of the 3 stream buttons to play notes; two buttons reflect the two songs used in that particular mix, and the third represents samples to add to the mix which can be adjusted with the effects dial. The player must also constantly adjust the crossfader to match onscreen symbols, which alters the relative volume of the songs as to bring one song to the forefront of the mix for a short time. Certain tracks are shown on screen as a series of up or <b>down</b> <b>arrow,</b> representing scratching sections, requiring the player to turn the turntable {{in the direction of the}} arrows while holding down the button to score points, mimicking the scratching of the record needle on vinyl albums. [...] "Euphoria" [...] is equivalent to Guitar Heros Star Power, collected by successfully completing specific phrases in the song mix, called Perfect Regions, and can be released by pressing the Euphoria button, doubling the player's current multiplier as well as automatic crossfading when active. There is also a [...] "Rewind" [...] meter that builds through consistent successful playing, and once full, allows the player to rewind the song to fix errors in their performance. The player must continue to perform well or their performance meter will drop and the music track will cut out. Failing the song is not possible, unlike in Guitar Hero games.|$|E

50|$|A spinner or numeric updown is a {{graphical}} {{control element}} with which a user may adjust a value in an adjoining text box by either clicking on an up or <b>down</b> <b>arrow,</b> or by holding an arrow down, causing {{the value in}} the text box to increase (if the up arrow is held down) or decrease (if the <b>down</b> <b>arrow</b> is held down). A spinner is typically oriented vertically. In most cases holding a button down causes {{the speed at which}} the associated value changes to increase. Usually, the value of the spinner is displayed in a text box next to the spinner, allowing the user to use the spinner to adjust the value, or to type the value into the text box.|$|E
50|$|Autocomplete, or word completion, is {{a feature}} {{in which an}} {{application}} predicts the rest of a word a user is typing. In graphical user interfaces, users can typically press the tab key to accept a suggestion or the <b>down</b> <b>arrow</b> key to accept one of several.|$|E

To complete a toss-up, each player determines the precise speed and angle of whatever object they are throwing to hit a target. Physical challenges are played the same way. Each player uses the up or <b>down</b> <b>arrows</b> on the controller to choose answers for trivia questions.

As shown in commemorative reliefs of the battle, Egyptian archers on ships and the nearby shores of the Nile rain <b>down</b> <b>arrows</b> on the enemy ships.
