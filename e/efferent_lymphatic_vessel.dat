Specific interactions between the naïve T cells and their cognate antigens result in T cell activation. The activated T cells, immunoblasts, undergo clonal expansion before acquiring effector functions.

When lymph fluid enters a node, it drains into the node {{just beneath the}} capsule in a space called the subcapsular sinus. The subcapsular sinus drains into trabecular sinuses and finally into medullary sinuses. The sinus space is criss-crossed by the pseudopods of macrophages, which act to trap foreign particles and filter the lymph. The medullary sinuses converge at the hilum and lymph then leaves the lymph node via the <b>efferent</b> <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessel</b> towards either a more central lymph node or ultimately for drainage into a central venous subclavian blood vessel.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to realize a {{revision}} of the anterior limb lymphatic draining of the Dasypus novemcinctus novemcinctus. 15 armadillos clinically healthy, male and female were utilized; they had been captured in the Argentine Northeast and were injected by the Gerota's Paste  modified method. The injection was realized at the fourth toe level on the medial side {{as well as on}} the lateral one; on the interphalangeal area, and on the left one over the manmary gland of both sides. The classical dissections were carried out with a surgery microscope, of Varimex type. The microphotographs were realized with a Zeiss microscope. The exhaustive analysis of the anterior limb area showed the following conclusions: the lymphatic circulation was observed from the distal extremity of the injected area to the axillar lymphocenter from where emitted 2 or 3 efferent lymphatic vessels; they were directed to the superficial inguinofemoral lymphonodule.

After twelve weeks, we performed NIR-ICG imaging and found that DHJST increased the ICG clearance at the footpad and the pulse of <b>efferent</b> <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessel</b> between popliteal lymph node and footpad. Histology staining at ankle joints showed that DHJST decreases synovial inflammation, bone erosion, cartilage erosion, and TRAP+ osteoclast area in TNF-Tg mice. Immunohistochemical staining by using anti-Lyve- 1 and anti-podoplanin antibody showed that DHJST stimulated lymphangiogenesis in ankle joints of TNF-Tg mice. And zebrafish study suggested that DHJST promoted the formation of lymphatic thoracic duct.

Later it was shown that the lymphocytes in such lymph contained a higher concentration of antibody than the lymph plasma surrounding them, and that this difference was greatest at the time of the highest rate of production of antibodies. The results of several types of experiments indicated that the antibody found within the lymphocytes was not absorbed or concentrated from the environment but presumably arose within the lymphocyte (2).

40|$|Bovine {{tuberculosis}} (TB), {{caused by}} Mycobacterium bovis, is increasing in incidence in the United Kingdom and detailed knowledge of host-pathogen interactions {{in the natural}} host is essential to facilitate disease control. Vaccination of neonatal calves with Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) induces a significant level of protection from infection with M. bovis. Since neonatal vaccination of humans with BCG induces activation of natural killer (NK) cells, and neonatal calves have high circulating numbers of these cells, it is proposed that NK cells are important in the response to BCG. Furthermore, NK cells {{play an important role}} in shaping adaptive immune responses through interactions with dendritic cells (DCs). The overall hypothesis of this project was that the enhanced efficacy of BCG in neonates is due to the increased number of NK cells, which through interactions with DCs can polarise Th 1 -type CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cell responses, both of which are involved in protection against M. bovis infection. Initially, the frequency and phenotype of NK cells across the blood, afferent lymph and the lymph nodes in steady-state conditions were compared. CD 2 - NK cells were the principal subset of NK cells migrating from the skin to the draining lymph node and were highly activated in afferent lymph and lymph nodes, compared with peripheral blood. It was also demonstrated that CD 2 - NK cells were the main subset of NK cells egressing from the lymph node via the <b>efferent</b> <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessel</b> to return to circulation. Since many vaccines including BCG are delivered subcutaneously, NK cell responses in the blood and the skin draining afferent lymphatic vessel, lymph nodes and <b>efferent</b> <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessel</b> were determined after BCG vaccination. Alterations in the frequency and receptor repertoire were evident following vaccination, supporting a role for NK cells during BCG vaccination of neonatal calves. To investigate the interactions of NK cells and BCG-infected DCs, in vitro co-cultures were established. CD 2 - NK cells were preferentially activated following culture with BCG-infected DCs and secreted high levels of IFN-γ. Overall, this thesis provides novel evidence that NK cells may re-circulate in steady-state conditions, play a role in BCG vaccination of neonatal calves, and that through interactions with BCG-infected DCs, may be involved in driving protective Th 1 -type adaptive immune responses...|$|E
40|$|The {{architecture}} of the mouse popliteal lymph nodes differs from that shown in conventional diagrams. The cortical lymphoid tissue, rather than forming a continuous outer layer, is organised into one or two hemispherical aggregates which project towards the hilus. These aggregates are surrounded by medullary tissue which thus extends to {{large areas of the}} surface of the node. The vascular distribution in the lymphoid aggregates is relatively sparse and contrasts with the dense meshwork of capillaries and venules around them. It also contrasts with the high vascularity of medullary tissue. Arterial vessels, especially those of larger calibre, are predominantly seen in the hilar area of the node suggesting that there is extensive branching as the artery enters the node. Capillaries associated with the lymphoid aggregates are usually lined by continuous endothelium, while those in the medulla are generally of the fenestrated type. The microcirculation has an extensive venous capacity and many venous segments are high endothelium venules whose walls are permeated by lymphocytes. Each node receives one or two afferent <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> and is drained by up to four or five <b>efferent</b> <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels.</b> In approximately half the nodes examined, there were extranodal communications between afferent and <b>efferent</b> <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> allowing some lymph to bypass the node...|$|R
40|$|Background: Vascularized {{lymph node}} {{transfer}} (VLNT) has shown promise {{as a treatment}} for breast cancer–related lymphedema, a common and debilitating condition among breast cancer survivors. In VLNT, the most popular lymph node flap donor site is the inguinal region; however, concerns about the possibility of iatrogenic lymphedema hamper the widespread adoption of VLNT. A better understanding of the anatomy of the lymphatic system in the inguinal region is essential to preserving lymph drainage in the leg and avoiding iatrogenic lymphedema. Methods: Five human cadaver hind-quarter specimens were used for this study. First, the specimens were scanned with indocyanine green fluorescence lymphography to map the <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels.</b> A dual injection technique using different radiocontrast media was then applied to delineate arteries and <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> on radiographs. Finally, radiological analysis and meticulous dissection were used to investigate relationships between the arteries and <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels.</b> Results: By chasing the <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> retrogradely from their corresponding lymph nodes, we were able to divide the superficial inguinal lymph nodes into three subgroups: the abdominal, medial thigh, and lateral thigh nodes. We found no connections between the superficial and deep lymphatic system in the inguinal region. The dominant lymph nodes draining the leg were in {{the lower part of the}} inguinal triangle, and their <b>efferent</b> <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> ran medial to the common femoral artery. Conclusions: Preserving the sentinel nodes of the lower leg in the medial thigh and their <b>efferent</b> <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> is crucial to avoid iatrogenic lymphedema in limbs with donor sites for VLNT. 9 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Antibody-producing {{cells have}} been {{identified}} among cells obtained from efferent lymphatic vessels, the thoracic duct, and peripheral blood. These cells, which produced plaques of hemolysis and which were quite rare (20 to 50 per million), due in most instances to 19 S antibody, were located and studied by electron microscopy. Of the antibody-producing cells found in these three sites there were several features common to all: small size (5 to 8 µ), generally spherical shape, approximately central position of the nucleus, and retention in {{the nucleus of the}} condensations of chromatin characteristic of the lymphocyte. The differences among the cells of these sources were largely in the relative amount and state of organization of the organelles of the cytoplasm. In cells of the <b>efferent</b> <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessel</b> and the thoracic duct, the endoplasmic reticulum showed a range from relative scarcity to considerable numbers of well organized channels. Between these extremes were cells with a considerable amount of endoplasmic reticulum, the channels disorganized and sectioned at various angles. The cytoplasmic matrix of all of these contained a profusion of polyribosomes. Antibody-producing cells obtained from peripheral blood showed, around the roughly spherical nucleus, a ring of cytoplasm which was narrow, but wholly organized into parallel lamellae of endoplasmic reticulum, with many polyribosomes between these, and a large Golgi body. Some similarities and some differences of these cells, in comparison with antibody-producing cells obtained from lymph nodes, have been indicated...|$|E

Intravenous noradrenaline infusion also increased frequency of contraction and lymph flow in all three vessels but prefemoral flow was depressed after the infusion had stopped. Lymphatic frequency of contraction and lymph flow increased when the animals were started. Anaesthetizing the animals with pentobarbitone did not abolish lymphatic contractions, nor did it prevent the response to adrenaline and noradrenaline infusion. The most obvious interpretation of these results is that adrenaline and noradrenaline act by increasing frequency and force of pumping of <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels...</b>|$|R

40|$|The tonsil of {{the soft}} palate, the {{predominant}} lymphoid tissue of the oropharynx in pigs, is important especially in initiating immune responses against antigenic material entering the mouth. The aim of this work was to describe the lymphatic pathways from the tonsils {{of the soft}} palate of pigs through lymph nodes of the head to the bloodstream. This was achieved by gross dissection, and by using Evans' Blue dye and Microfil casts. <b>Efferent</b> <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> from the tonsil coalesce to form vessels which convey lymph to the primary nodes, the mandibular and medial retropharyngeal, and thence to the bloodstream, along two distinct pathways. In the superficial pathway, lymph flows through the mandibular lymph node, along <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> {{closely associated with the}} linguofacial vein, to the ventral superficial cervical node (middle group) and the accessory mandibular node. Most efferent vessels from the accessory mandibular node enter the ventral superficial cervical node, but some may directly join the <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> emanating from the ventral superficial cervical node. These vessels convey lymph to the dorsal superficial cervical node and thence, via the <b>efferent</b> <b>lymphatics,</b> to the circulatory system. In the deep pathway, lymph is conveyed directly to the medial retropharyngeal node and then to the tracheal trunk, as in other domestic animals.

It is also in perivascular, peribronchial and even interstitial areas in the lower airways of the lung. To call it BALT {{it has to be}} structured accumulation of lymphocytes and other immune cells. There are lymphoid follicles with apparent germinal centres with most B-cells surrounded by T-cell area. In interfollicular T-cell area, there are many dendritic cells presenting antigen to T-cells and in germinal centres, there are follicular dendritic cells. There are CD4+ Th lymphocytes in germinal centres and interfollicular area and CD8+ T cells mainly in interfollicular area.

40|$|Animal {{studies of}} lymph node {{metastasis}} are constrained by limitations in the techniques available for noninvasive {{monitoring of the}} progression of lymph node metastasis, as well as difficulties {{in the establishment of}} appropriate animal models. To overcome these challenges, this study has developed a mouse model of inter-lymph-node metastasis via afferent <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> for use in the development of imaging modalities. We used 14 - to 18 -week-old MRL/MpJ 2 /lpr/lpr (MRL/lpr) mice exhibiting remarkable systemic lymphadenopathy, with proper axillary lymph nodes (proper-ALNs) and subiliac lymph nodes (SiLNs) that are 6 to 12 mm in diameter (similar in size to human lymph nodes). When KM-Luc/GFP malignant fibrous histiocytoma-like cells stably expressing the firefly luciferase gene were injected into the SiLN, metastasis could be detected in the proper-ALN within 3 to 9 days, using in vivo bioluminescence imaging. The metastasis route was found to be via the <b>efferent</b> <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> of the SiLN, and metastasis incidence depended on the number of cells injected, the injection duration and the SiLN volume. Three-dimensional contrast-enhanced high-frequency ultrasound imaging showed that the blood vessel volume and density in the metastasized proper-ALN significantly increased at 14 days after tumor cell inoculation into the SiLN.

40|$|In dogs, lymph drains from tissues {{throughout}} the head, including the tonsils, along <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> to the facial, parotid, lateral retropharyngeal and mandibular lymph nodes. From the mandibular lymph nodes, lymph may {{flow to the}} ipsilateral medial retropharyngeal lymph nodes, or along anastomotic connections to the contralateral node. Afferent lymphatics convey lymph from these nodes to defined areas in the medial retropharyngeal nodes. They divide {{over the surface of}} the node, and within trabeculae. Terminal afferent lymphatics are connected to the subcapsular and trabecular sinuses either through circular or oval holes in the vessel wall, or terminate at the sinus where the vessel contains a valve adjacent to the point of entry. The subcapsular sinus surrounds the entire node, and is continuous with an interconnecting network of trabecular and cortical sinuses which convey lymph through the cortex. Connective tissue septa extend through the sinuses and lymph flows freely between adjacent sinuses through holes in the septal walls. Initial <b>efferent</b> <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels,</b> which arise from the medullary sinuses between medullary cords, converge towards and unite within the network of medullary trabeculae.

40|$|The palatine tonsils play a {{key role}} in {{initiating}} immune responses against antigenic material entering the mouth and their lymphatic pathways are important in disseminating immunological information to the lymph nodes and other mucosal surfaces. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy and Mercox casts were used to examine the intercellular and lymphatic pathways of the palatine tonsil in dogs. Intercellular fluid within the intraepithelial passageways of the reticular epithelium flows through pores in the basement membrane and intermingles with that of the subepithelial intercellular spaces. From there, tissue fluid enters initial lymphatics which form a plexus surrounding each follicle. No <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> are seen entering or leaving the follicles but intercellular pathways of the follicles are continuous with those of the adjacent initial lymphatics. These pathways appear to provide the only route for lymphocytes leaving the follicles and directly entering the lymphatic pathway. Lymph then flows into sinuses adjacent to, and incompletely surrounding, the base of follicles; or it may enter a network of sinuses between and beneath the lymphoid follicles which convey lymph throughout the parafollicular tissue. Lymphoid cells enter the parafollicular sinuses which may be a major entry site of lymphocytes emigrating from the lymphoid parenchyma. Some lymph may bypass these sinuses by entering septal <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> oriented perpendicular to the central connective tissue lamina of the palatine tonsil. All lymph is collected into basal <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> where valves prevent retrograde flow.

Many other students have tended to deem the lymphonodi as the same in different animals. Moreover, the differences in structure depending on location of node, which should be important for functional significations, were only affirmed by a few investigators, such as JOB, JORDAN et LOOPER, ASCHOFF and GYLLENSTEN, while DAWSON et MASUR denied any such fact.

40|$|During {{adaptive}} immune responses, CD 8 (+) T {{cells with}} low TCR affinities are released early into the circulation before high-affinity clones become dominant at later time points. How functional avidity maturation is orchestrated in lymphoid tissue and how low-affinity cells contribute to host protection remains unclear. In this study, we used intravital imaging of reactive lymph nodes (LNs) {{to show that}} T cells rapidly attached to dendritic cells irrespective of TCR affinity, whereas one day later, the duration of these stable interactions ceased progressively with lowering peptide major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) affinity. This correlated inversely BATF (basic leucine zipper transcription factor, ATF-like) and IRF 4 (interferon-regulated factor 4) induction and timing of effector differentiation, as low affinity-primed T cells acquired cytotoxic activity earlier than high affinity-primed ones. After activation, low-affinity effector CD 8 (+) T cells accumulated at <b>efferent</b> <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> for egress, whereas high affinity-stimulated CD 8 (+) T cells moved to interfollicular regions in a CXCR 3 -dependent manner for sustained pMHC stimulation and prolonged expansion.

40|$|Introduction: In renal cell {{carcinoma}} (RCC), lymphogenous metastasis is often detected outside of the expected hilar nodal region. A better understanding of lymphatic drainage in RCC would contribute to more accurate staging and an evidence-based consensus on retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. Methods: We reviewed anatomic dissection studies since the 17 th century on lymphatic drainage of the kidney in humans. We summarized the results from recent sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping studies in RCC patients. Results: Our anatomic review revealed the primary landing sites of anterior and posterior <b>efferent</b> <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> draining {{the right and left}} kidney (Table). In 2 clinical studies (n= 24), lymphatic drainage was localized to the paraaortic, paracaval, retrocaval, and interaortocaval LNs in 22 patients. (Bex et al., Sharif et al.) Extraabdominal drainage was observed in 2 patients (mediastinal, pleural, int. mammary). Right-sided tumors (n= 16) only drained to paracaval, retrocaval and interaortocaval LNs, except in 1 patient who also had a sentinel paraaortic LN. Left-sided tumors (n= 8) only drained to paraaortic LNs, except in 1 patient who also had a sentinel interaortocaval LN. Moreover, lymphovenous communication {{at the level of the}} renal vein exists in primates and rodents but remains unknown in humans. Conclusions: Lymphatic drainage pathways described in past anatomic studies demonstrated a high similarity with the SLNs mapped in clinical studies. However, heterogeneity among SLN biopsy protocols may reduce the significance of results. Future anatomic studies should be carried out on pathological specimens with clinical studies using a standardized SLN biopsy approach. 2 page(s...|$|R

We used a complex of traditional macroscopic and histological techniques, and also immunohistochemical staining of lymph node sections for identifying the features of localization of T- and B-lymphocyte populations in the parenchyma of the nodes. We found that the parenchyma of camels’ lymph nodes {{is characterized by a}} spongy type structure {{in the form of a}} complex of partly concrescent round-oval fragments of lymphoid tissue, surrounded by large lymphatic spaces (sinuses). The connective tissue frame of the lymph nodes is represented by a two-layer (connective tissue-muscular) capsule and two types of trabeculae: two-layered (connective-muscular, type I), which contain blood and <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels,</b> as well as lymphatic cysternas, and single-layered, formed only by a smooth muscular system (type II). Intranodal lymphatic sinuses are subdivided into subcapsular, peritrabecular and medullary sinuses. The subcapsular sinuses and sinuses related to trabeculae of type I and their branching is the most developed. At the tissue level, the lymph node parenchyma has a clearly manifested lobular structure. Lymphoid lobules in the lymph node parenchyma are positioned diffusely (mosaically) and consist of four main cellular zones: transit and cell-cell interaction (analogous to the cortical plateau), clonal proliferation of T- and, respectively, B-lymphocytes (deep cortex units, lymphatic nodules), accumulation of plasmocytes and synthesis of antibodies (brain cords). The lymphoid lobes (compartments) of the lymph nodes parenchyma are bipolar, their tops formed by the zones of transit and cell-cell interaction, and also by the zones of proliferation of B lymphocytes, and the bases by a complex of brain cords (zone of accumulation of plasmocytes and synthesis of antibodies). The zone of T-lymphocytes proliferation is in intermediate position and underlies the subunits of the parenchyma. The tops of the lymphoid lobes are located along the sinuses of the trabeculae of type I and the bases along the sinuses of the trabeculae of type II, which form the <b>efferent</b> <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels.</b> The maximum relative capacity of all studied lymph nodes was typical for zones of plasmocyte accumulation and synthesis of antibodies (19 – 27 %), the minimum capacity was typical for transit and cell-cell interaction zones (3 – 8 %). The relative capacity of zones of clonal proliferation of T- and B-lymphocytes in most lymph nodes was 1. 5 – 3. 0 times less than that of the zone of plasmocyte accumulation and antibody formation and was, respectively, 8 – 16 % and 9 – 18 %. The study showed that the structure of the lymph nodes parenchyma of dromedaries is not absolutely unique. As in other mammal species, it is subdivided into specialized cell zones which are connected in lymphoid lobules. Specific features of parenchyma structure include: diffuse (mosaic) location of lymphoid lobules; absence of signs of regulated localization of lymphoid lobules relative to the capsule and the sinus bordering the nodes...|$|R
40|$|The {{secondary}} {{immune response}} to live and killed Staphylococcus aureus vaccines was studied in efferent popliteal lymph of sheep. Animals were immunized with either live or killed S. aureus intracutaneously on the lateral hock, in an area draining into the popliteal lymph node. Six weeks later, an <b>efferent</b> popliteal <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessel</b> in the vaccinated leg was cannulated, and 48 hr after surgery a second inoculation (identical to the primary) {{was placed in the}} skin adjacent to the primary vaccination lesion. A dramatic decrease in lymphocyte output ('cell shutdown') was observed in lymph collected from sheep given the secondary inoculation of live S. aureus during the first 8 hr after inoculation. However, only a moderate decrease in lymphocyte output occurred in lymph from animals receiving killed S. aureus or from control animals. The proportion of eosinophils in lymph collected from animals given live S. aureus increased to a peak (14 % of total leucocytes in lymph) between 6 hr and 8 hr, and returned to prechallenge levels by 24 hr post-inoculation. The percentage of neutrophils in lymph peaked between 8 hr and 1 day after injection of live bacteria. This granulocyte response was not observed in animals given killed S. aureus or control animals. IgM-, IgG 1 - and IgG 2 - containing cells (-cc) in lymph were quantified by indirect immunofluorescence. Animals given live S. aureus produced lymph with greater numbers of Ig-cc of these isotypes than those given killed organisms. The ratio of IgG 2 -cc:IgG 1 -cc was significantly greater in lymph from animals given live S. aureus from Day 2 to Day 6 post-challenge. IgM and IgG 1 anti-staphylococcal antibody levels increased in lymph collected from all vaccinated animals, but only sheep given live S. aureus showed any increase in levels of IgG 2 antibody...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} the already {{published}} three reports and this paper are summarized as follows (ref. the summarized table) : 1. The 48 groups of lymph nodes were distinguished by their positions in the cat. Out of them, 9 groups : Lnn. subinguinales profundi, Lnn. epigastrici craniales, Ln. femoralis lateralis, Ln. prefemoralis, Lnn. intestinales, Lnn. sacrales laterales, Ln. mediastinalis ventralis, Lnn. mediastinales dorsales and Ln. diaphragmaticus, as lymph nodes in the cat, are herein described {{for the first time}} on the basis of the writers' observations. Furthermore, in 13 groups (^* mark) some revisions have become necessary in detailed descriptions. 2. Each group of lymph nodes was placed in either the constant (100 %), nearly constant (less than 100 %, over 80 %) or inconstant (less than 80 %) group determined by that occurrence ratio. The inconstant group, it showed a specific feature in that it consists of small nodes, generally less than 6 mm in the longest diameter. 3. In regard to the numbers of lymph nodes, some remarkable individual variations were noted in the abdominal cavity only, but not in other areas. No definite variations were found by sexes or between the right and left sides of the body. 4. The afferent and <b>efferent</b> <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> of the above groups of lymph nodes have been described in the writers' series of reports. 5. In addition, three kinds of specific lymph streams were distinguished and discussed, as follows : 1) The branch lymph streams of the thoracic duct and jugular trunks were detected in some cases. Some branches of the thoracic duct passed through Lnn. mediastinales craniales, Lnn. tracheobronchiales craniales dextri, as has already been stated in respect to the cat. The writers, furthermore, found for the first time some branches of the thoracic duct which passed through Lnn. mediastinales dorsales, Lnn. tracheobronchiales craniales sinistri, Lnn. tracheobronchiales caudales and Ln. infraclacicularis, and some branches of the jugular trunk which passed through Lnn. anguli brachiocephalici. In the thoracic duct of the cat, the network formation surrounded Aa. intercostales in all cases. 2) Some peripheral <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels,</b> originating from the trachea, esophagus, thyroid gland, thymus, diaphragm, costal pleura, testis and ovary, empty directly into the jugular trunk, thoracic duct, lumbar trunk or cisterna chyli without the lymph passing through a node and then pour into the venous angles. The appearance of such <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> is related intimately with the degree of occurrence of the special fixed nodes in accordance with the peripheral areas of their origin. It was suggested that such <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> maintain an undifferentiated state without developing any appropriate node. 3) The writers found lymphatic communications by which lymph streams reversely among lymph nodes. The communications are divided into three types as follows : type A-connection by which lymph is able to stream reversely through a valveless-like vessel; type B-connection whose <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels</b> with single flowing direction alternate with each other among nodes; type C-connection by lymphatic networks with valves at various places. To the matter of this finding, no attention has been paid particularly until now. The occurrences of such communications are more numerous in the body surface than those in the thoracic and abdominal cavities. From the obtained results and from consideration of the development of the lymphatics, it seems that such communications derive from a remainder of a lymphatic plexus which appeared in the course of the developmental process. The third type is C, an original form, which may be changed from type B to type A, a more advanced one. A lymph stream by way of such communications among nodes may flow from the periphery towards the body center in the normal living state. But if the tissue pressure in the peripheral areas is made higher by some conditions, such flow can clearly be reversed. The three kinds of specific lymph vessels should be noted in pathology and physiology to act as a specific pathway of the lymph. 6. The writers divided lymph nodes into three types of Z, T and ZT, and made macroscopic observations with considerations of the structural differences among the nodes of each type. The node of type Z receives only peripheral lymph, that of type T receives only lymph which has passed through other nodes and that of type ZT receives both sorts of lymph. The occurrences of each type differed among the groups of lymph nodes which were determined by their locations. As a rule, no definite differences were macroscopically detected between types Z and ZT, but only type T showed a specific feature; type T is small node, approximately 1 mm in diameter, which does not join into groups at a definite position but appears as an accessory one accompanying types Z and ZT without exception. 7. From the ratio of occurrences, types classified by appearances of afferent vessels and sizes of lymph nodes, the writers suggest, at least, that there is something of structural difference among nodes of 3 groups as follows : 1. nodes of types Z and ZT in the writers' constant and nearly constant groups, 2. nodes of types Z and ZT in the writers' inconstant group, 3. nodes of type T, without falling into groups classified with relation to their ratio of occurrence. The suggestion should be followed up by microscopical observations. 8. In this observation, Neoprene latex was used in an attempt to find whether it was applicable for demonstration of <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels.</b> Neoprene latex is within the range of possibility of use as an injection material for comparatively larger vessels, but more advanced study is necessary before it can be recommended for injection into the peripheral <b>lymphatic</b> <b>vessels...</b>|$|R
