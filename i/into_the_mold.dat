25|$|The process {{consists}} of three major steps: casting or molding a core, inserting the core <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> and shooting the mold, and finally removing the molding and melting out the core.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{the molten}} metal (1) is poured <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mold,</b> which vaporizes the foam (3) {{allowing}} the metal {{to fill the}} entire mold. The vapor is simultaneously extracted from the flask through the sand.|$|E
25|$|Full-mold casting is an evaporative-pattern {{casting process}} {{which is a}} {{combination}} of sand casting and lost-foam casting. It uses an expanded polystyrene foam pattern which is then surrounded by sand, much like sand casting. The metal is then poured directly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mold,</b> which vaporizes the foam upon contact.|$|E
50|$|<b>Molds</b> of <b>the</b> {{parts are}} created and hot liquid plastic is poured <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>molds.</b> <b>The</b> <b>molds</b> contain <b>the</b> {{shape of the}} parts and the {{snapping}} component built in. However, one major risk when the cooling of <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> finishes is <b>the</b> product shrinking causing errors in the attachment parts.|$|R
5000|$|After 8-10 seconds, {{the lids}} of <b>the</b> <b>molds</b> expand {{so that the}} {{pressure}} increases. At {{the end of the}} process of the combination of pressure and temperature, the cake has completely expanded <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>molds.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{concept for}} the casting of {{metallic}} fuels pins containing low vapor pressure materials is presented and discussed. The important physics {{of this concept}} include the mass transport of americium from the melt, the induction heating and stirring of the melt, plus the casting of long slender fuel rods. This paper discusses and presents preliminary modeling results for the casting of long, slender fuel rods. The model considers the flow of <b>the</b> melt <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>molds,</b> heat transfer <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>molds,</b> and <b>the</b> impact of process parameters on {{the formation of the}} fuel rod...|$|R
25|$|Synthetic replicas {{can be made}} {{to avoid}} the use of {{original}} samples when they are not suitable or available for SEM examination due to methodological obstacles or legal issues. This technique is achieved in two steps: (1) a mold of the original surface is made using a silicone-based dental elastomer, and (2) a replica of the original surface is obtained by pouring a synthetic resin <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mold.</b>|$|E
25|$|Cores {{are used}} for complex {{injection}} moldings in the fusible core injection molding process. First, a core is made from a fusible alloy or low melting temperature polymer. It is then placed inside the injection mold's dies and the plastic is shot <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mold.</b> The molding is then removed from the mold with the core still in it. Finally, the core is melted or washed out of the molding in a hot bath.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} step, the core is then {{inserted}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mold.</b> For simple molds {{this is as}} simple as inserting the core and closing the dies. However, more complex tools require multiple steps from the programmed robot. For instance, some complex tools can have multiple conventional side pulls that mate with the core to add rigidity to the core and reduce the core mass. After the core is loaded and the press closed the plastic is shot.|$|E

25|$|Evaporative-pattern casting {{is a type}} {{of casting}} process that uses a pattern made from a {{material}} that will evaporate when the molten metal is poured <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> cavity. <b>The</b> most common evaporative-pattern material used is polystyrene foam.|$|R
2500|$|One key in casting metal cores is to {{make sure}} they do not contain any {{porosity}} as it will induce flaws <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>molded</b> part. In order to minimize porosity the metal may be gravity cast or <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> cavity may be pressurized. Another system slowly rocks the casting dies as <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> cavity fills to [...] "shake" [...] the air bubbles out.|$|R
25|$|This {{casting process}} is {{advantageous}} for very complex castings, that would regularly require cores. It is also dimensionally accurate, requires no draft, {{and has no}} parting lines so no flash is formed. As compared to investment casting, it is cheaper {{because it is a}} simpler process and the foam is cheaper than the wax. Risers are not usually required {{due to the nature of}} the process; because the molten metal vaporizes the foam the first metal <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> cools more quickly than the rest, which results in natural directional solidification.|$|E
25|$|Behind {{the mold}} disk {{is the type}} metal pot, which {{contains}} molten type metal. A piston in the pot pushes the molten metal down into the pot, which forces the metal through the pot throat and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mold,</b> forcing it against {{the faces of the}} matrices. These have character shapes cut into them, so the result is a cast slug with the character shapes of the line on its front face. The mold disk is sometimes water-cooled, and often air-cooled with a blower, to carry away the heat of the molten type metal and allow the cast slugs to solidify quickly.|$|E
25|$|To prevent gas {{porosity}} the material may be melted in a vacuum, {{in an environment}} of low-solubility gases, such as argon or carbon dioxide, or under a flux that prevents contact with the air. To minimize gas solubility the superheat temperatures can be kept low. Turbulence from pouring the liquid metal <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> can introduce gases, so the molds are often streamlined to minimize such turbulence. Other methods include vacuum degassing, gas flushing, or precipitation. Precipitation involves reacting the gas with another element to form a compound that will form a dross that floats to the top. For instance, oxygen can be removed from copper by adding phosphorus; aluminum or silicon can be added to steel to remove oxygen. A third source consists of reactions of the molten metal with grease or other residues in the mould.|$|E

30|$|Molding process {{started by}} pouring and {{flattening}} <b>the</b> hot pulp <b>into</b> <b>the</b> prepared <b>mold.</b> Then, <b>the</b> pulp in <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> was dried while being steadily pressed {{to eliminate the}} water.|$|R
25|$|There are {{a number}} of ways to reduce the {{concentration}} of inclusions. In order to reduce oxide formation the metal can be melted with a flux, in a vacuum, or in an inert atmosphere. Other ingredients can be added to the mixture to cause the dross to float to the top where it can be skimmed off before the metal is poured <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mold.</b> If this is not practical, then a special ladle that pours the metal from the bottom can be used. Another option is to install ceramic filters into the gating system. Otherwise swirl gates can be formed which swirl the liquid metal as it is poured in, forcing the lighter inclusions to the center and keeping them out of the casting. If some of the dross or slag is folded into the molten metal then it becomes an entrainment defect.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{difficulties}} that result from these long development times and high costs is making accurate cores repeatably. This is extremely important because the core {{is an integral part}} of the mold, so essentially each shot is into a new mold cavity. Another difficulty is keeping the core from melting when the plastic is shot <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mold,</b> because the plastic is approximately twice the melting temperature of the core material. A third difficulty is the low strength of the core. Hollow plastic cores can collapse if too much pressure is used in the shot plastic. Metal cores (with low melting temperatures) are solid so they cannot collapse, but are only 10% as strong as steel cores so they can distort. This is especially a problem when molding manifolds, because the waviness of the core can be detrimental to the airflow within the runners.|$|E
25|$|One {{aspect of}} cricket-keeping, that of growing molded, custom-shaped gourds {{destined to become}} cricket homes, was an {{exclusive}} monopoly of the Forbidden City. The royal gardeners would place the ovary of an emerging Lagenaria fruit inside an earthen mould, forcing the fruit {{to take up the}} desired shape. The oldest surviving molded gourd, Hasshin Hyōko dated 1238, is preserved in Hōryū-ji temple in Japan. The art reached its peak in the 18th century, when the gardeners implemented reusable carved wood and disposable clay molds. The shapes of the gourds were tailored to different species of cricket: larger gourds for larger species, long-bottle gourds for the species known for long hops, and so on. Immature fruit easily reproduces the artwork carved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mold,</b> but also easily picks up any natural or man-made impurities. The finest craftsmen exploited, rather than concealed, these blemishes. Molded gourds were a symbol of the highest social standing. The ones held by Chinese royalty depicted in medieval portraits were actually prized cricket containers. The Yongzheng Emperor held a gourd in his hand even when he was sleeping, the Qianlong Emperor maintained a private molded gourd garden. In the 1800s the Jiaqing Emperor lifted the monopoly on molded gourds, but they remained expensive even for the upper classes.|$|E
5000|$|Co{{injection}} is a polymer injection {{technology in}} which different polymers are injected <b>into</b> <b>the</b> same <b>mold.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{second type}} of defect is metal penetration, which occurs when the liquid metal penetrates <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> sand. This causes a rough surface finish. This is caused by sand {{particles}} which are too coarse, lack of mold wash, or pouring temperatures that are too high. An alternative form of metal penetration <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mould known as veining is caused by cracking of the sand.|$|R
5000|$|Raw {{castings}} often contain irregularities {{caused by}} seams and imperfections in <b>the</b> <b>molds,</b> {{as well as}} access ports for pouring material <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>molds.</b> [...] <b>The</b> process of cutting, grinding, shaving or sanding away these unwanted bits is called [...] "fettling". In modern times robotic processes {{have been developed to}} perform some of the more repetitive parts of the fettling process, but historically fettlers carried out this arduous work manually, [...] and often in conditions dangerous to their health.|$|R
500|$|The {{reason for}} the {{difficulties}} with the bell is not certain. The Whitechapel Foundry, still in business today, takes {{the position that the}} bell was either damaged in transit or was broken by an inexperienced bell ringer, who incautiously sent the clapper flying against the rim, rather than the body of the bell. In 1975, the Winterthur Museum conducted an analysis of the metal in the bell, and concluded that [...] "a series of errors made in the construction, reconstruction, and second reconstruction of the Bell resulted in a brittle bell that barely missed being broken up for scrap". The Museum found a considerably higher level of tin in the Liberty Bell than in other Whitechapel bells of that era, and suggested that Whitechapel made an error in the alloy, perhaps by using scraps {{with a high level of}} tin to begin the melt instead of the usual pure copper. The analysis found that, on the second recasting, instead of adding pure tin to the bell metal, Pass and Stow added cheap pewter with a high lead content, and incompletely mixed the new metal <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mold.</b> The result was [...] "an extremely brittle alloy which not only caused the Bell to fail in service but made it easy for early souvenir collectors to knock off substantial trophies from the rim".|$|E
2500|$|Replicated CDs are mass-produced {{initially}} using {{a hydraulic}} press. Small granules of heated raw polycarbonate plastic are {{fed into the}} press. A screw forces the liquefied plastic <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> cavity. The mold closes with a metal stamper {{in contact with the}} disc surface. The plastic is allowed to cool and harden. Once opened, the disc substrate is removed from the mold by a robotic arm, and a 15mm diameter center hole (called a stacking ring) is created. The time it takes to [...] "stamp" [...] one CD is usually two to three seconds.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} {{was built}} from sheets of plywood, skinned over wooden ribs. Using a large concrete mold, a single {{half of the}} fuselage shell was laminated in sections with glue between each layer and then a rubber bladder was lowered <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> and inflated with air to compress the lamination into shape against {{the inside of the}} mold. The two fuselage halves were then nailed and glued over a separately constructed rib framework. With the fuselage constructed in this fashion, the wing spar couldn't cut through the fuselage, so the single spar cantilever wing was mounted atop the aircraft. Only the engine and landing gear remained essentially unstreamlined, and on the production versions the undercarriage had teardrop shaped [...] "spats" [...] covering the wheels, while only the earliest versions lacked NACA cowlings and had the engine cylinders exposed to the airstream. It was powered by the Wright Whirlwind air-cooled radial engine, which delivered 225 horsepower (168kW).|$|E
40|$|Progress {{continues}} on {{the analysis of}} casting and solidification of <b>the</b> melt <b>into</b> <b>molds.</b> Modeling results for constant pressure casting, which is more realistic, have been obtained and produce physically realistic results for flow that starts, flows, and then eventually stops as it enters <b>the</b> <b>mold.</b> Potential mass transfer modeling features (Lammuir’s law for example) are being studied to enhance the capabilities of a mass transfer in a detailed system model. Different parameters are being varied {{as part of a}} parametric study to evaluate factors that impact the flow of <b>the</b> melt <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>molds.</b> <b>The</b> ability to include the induction heating governing equations as part of an overall system model is being studied and preliminary efforts to include this complex phenomenon as part of a more detailed model are underway...|$|R

5|$|Heated-{{manifold}} direct-injection die casting, {{also known}} as direct-injection die casting or runnerless die casting, is a zinc die casting process where molten zinc is forced through a heated manifold and then through heated mini-nozzles, which lead <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>molding</b> cavity. This process has the advantages of lower cost per part, through the reduction of scrap (by the elimination of sprues, gates and runners) and energy conservation, and better surface quality through slower cooling cycles.|$|R
2500|$|This {{casting process}} is {{advantageous}} for very complex castings that would regularly require cores. It is also dimensionally accurate, maintains an excellent surface finish, requires no draft, {{and has no}} parting lines so no flash is formed. The un-bonded sand of lost foam casting can be much simpler to maintain than green sand and resin bonded sand systems. [...] Lost foam is generally more economical than investment casting because it involves fewer steps. Risers are not usually required {{due to the nature}} of the process; because the molten metal vaporizes the foam the first metal <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> cools more quickly than the rest, which results in natural directional solidification. Foam is easy to manipulate, carve and glue, due to its unique properties. The flexibility of LFC often allows for consolidating the parts into one integral component; other forming processes would require the production of one or more parts to be assembled.|$|E
2500|$|Irregular cast silver ingots {{circulated}} {{from about}} 11th to early 12th centuries. Only one such example is known from Lithuania, found in 1938 in Graužiai. Around {{the second half}} of the 12th century, supply of minted Western European coins dried up and there was no centralized power in Eastern Europe to take up coin mintage. The period is known as [...] "coinless period". However, merchants needed a means of exchange. Therefore, a local system of cast silver ingots was developed. While silver was imported (there are no silver mines in the region; the main mining area was in the Upper Harz in Germany), the ingots were cast locally. At first, a wax model was created. Then it was coated with clay and fired in a furnace inside a clay or sand pit. The wax would melt leaving a mold for the ingot. Molten silver was poured <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mold</b> using a special clay scoop. After cooling off, the mold was broken to remove the ingot. Therefore, most molds were one-time use though a few examples of ingots are known that were cast using the same mold. Because of this technique, archaeologists have not discovered any furnaces or molds, only clay spoons and pouring cups.|$|E
