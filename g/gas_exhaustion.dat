40|$|Gas bubble streams are {{detected}} {{in the water column}} by the presence of strong, flare shaped backscatter signals recorded during hydroacoustic single beam echosounder surveys (flares). Some of these flares even reach the sea surface. In motion bubbles get into an evolutionary process caused by a variety of effects, including gaseous exchange with surrounding water. Simplistically, kinetics of such a gas exchange can be described by the Fick’s law; the direction of the transfer of any given gas through the bubble depends on partial pressure of respective the gas in bubble, Henry’s law constants and the concentration of dissolved gas in the water. In general, methane gradually dissolves during the lifetime of a bubble, while other gases enter the bubble. Consequently, bubbles cause a vertical transfer of methane from the sea bottom to upper water layers and can be considered as sources of dispersed methane flux to the water column. In present work an attempt is made to trace the methane <b>gas</b> phase <b>exhaustion</b> in flares trough the water column at the Black Sea shelf. Our approach is based upon acoustic observations and measurements carried out in 2003 and 2004 with the scientific echosounder EK- 500 onboard RV Vodianitskiy as part of the EU funded project CRIMEA. For the estimation of bubble size distributions our data from direct measurements of acoustic cross-section of single bubbles were used. Data for the relation between rising speed and shrinking rate vs. bubble size were obtained by tracking of single bubbles. Modelling was used to evaluate features of the gas transfer process induced by rising bubbles. Having initial bubble size, gas composition and water depth as starting conditions the model produces series of time based values of bubble size, gas composition, rising depth and rising speed. Acoustic observations were utilized to verify the chosen model parameters. For seeps detected at 90 - 95 m water depth hydroacoustically measured bubble sizes ranged from 1. 3 to 11. 3 mm in diameter. This bubble size range was confirmed by visual observations during video and submersible inspections. We assumed a gas content of 99 % methane and small amounts of nitrogen and oxygen as initial gas composition according to geochemical analyses of gas bubbles sampled by submersible just above the sea floor. To determine the entire free methane flux from the sea floor into the water column and maybe into the atmosphere we run our model for several bubble sizes classes. Then simulation data were summed up with weighting coefficients according to the respective amount of bubbles per class. As a result, vertical profiles of molar content (mkmol) and methane flux (mkmol/s m) per average statistic bubble vs. depth were obtained. To get methane flux from the whole seepage simple multiplication is required by average statistic initial number of bubbles above the bottom per unit height. Depending on the spatial extension of the seep area, point or volume backscattering methods were used to quantify the bubble amount. Of great importance for both methods is the averaging of a high amount of data in space and time. We detected an average of 400 bubbles at high intensity seep sites within a water volume of 1 m thickness above the bottom. The hydroacoustically determined amount of bubbles is again in very good agreement with direct visual observations. With an average initial rising speed of 0. 25 m/s, 400 bubbles escaping from the sea floor cause a methane flux of 3. 45 mmol/s using average bubble methane content of 34. 5 mkmol (400 x 0. 25 x 34. 5 = 3. 45 mmol/s). As final methane content of average bubble at the sea surface is 6. 5 mkmol, only 6. 5 / 34. 5 * 100 = 18. 8 % of methane can reach the atmosphere due to the methane flux into the water column on {{the way up to the}} sea surface...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of sustainable energy production methods {{is an important}} aspect in lowering the emission of greenhouse <b>gases</b> and <b>exhaustion</b> of fossil fuels. Wind energy is recognized globally {{as one of the}} most promising sustainable forms of electricity generation, but the cost of offshore wind energy does not meet the level of fossil-based energy sources. An opportunity for wind energy cost reduction is the deployment of two-bladed wind turbines at offshore locations. Two-bladed turbines save the mass and cost of one rotor blade, which allows the entire wind turbine construction to be designed lighter, and in effect leads to lower initial costs. Moreover, reduction of harmonic fatigue loads on blades and other turbine parts using Individual Pitch Control (IPC) is a way to extend the turbine lifetime. This type of control, using a feedback control structure incorporating the Multi-Blade Coordinate (MBC) transformation, is capable of mitigating the most dominant periodic loads. It is generally known that significant turbine load reductions can be achieved using IPC, however, it is unclear to what extent the MBC pitch signal is optimal in terms of load alleviations. The main goal of this thesis is to develop a self-learning feedforward IPC strategy for a state-ofthe- art two-bladed wind turbine. This IPC strategy will be compared to the conventional feedback IPC implementation. By making use of properties of the MBC transformation, implementations of yaw control by IPC in different configurations are evaluated in terms of performance and stability. As a preparation for the comparison between conventional feedback and self-learning feedforward IPC strategies, a linear control-oriented model from blade pitch angles to harmonic blade loads is identified and used throughout this work for two main purposes. The first purpose is to reveal the level of interaction between both blades, which turns out to be negligible. On the basis of this reasoning, an appropriate cost-function is implemented for optimization of the feedforward controller. The second purpose of the linear model is the simplified and faster {{development of}} the Iterative Feedback Tuning (IFT) algorithm, which is later implemented in high-fidelity non-linear wind turbine simulation software. IFT is a self-learning model-free algorithm, and is used to optimize the rotor-position dependent feedforward IPC implementation. It is shown that the self-learning algorithm succeeds in optimization of the feedforward controller at all constant wind speeds, but also in more realistic turbulent wind conditions in the above-rated region. As the feedforward controller generates a constant amplitude pitch signal for each wind speed, the amplitude of the feedforward pitch signal is gain-scheduled on exogenous load signals, in an effort to improve feedforward performance. Results show that the conventional IPC strategy is optimal in terms of load reductions in steady state wind conditions, as the IFT algorithm optimizes to the exact same pitch signal at various constant wind speeds. In turbulent wind conditions, performance results indicate that the constant amplitude feedforward controller is able to attain significant load reductions, but that the performance of the conventional feedback control method is still superior. Comparing the pitch signals of both controllers in turbulent wind conditions, reveals that the conventional method continuously changes the phase of the implemented pitch signal, which is not driven by the varying rotor speed. To see how these changing pitch periodics have an effect on the load reduction capabilities, the feedforward (rotor speed dependent) pitch signal amplitude is scheduled on exogenous signals in various ways. This scheduling shows only minor performance improvements, and it can be concluded that the frequency changes in the pitch signal imposed by MBC, help to actively mitigate periodic blade loads. Using both the azimuth and blade load measurements, the conventional IPC strategy seems to actively track and mitigate the current present blade load harmonic, and it appears to be a serious challenge to develop control strategies that can improve performance already attained by MBC.

40|$|Galaxy interactions/mergers {{have been}} shown to {{dominate}} the population of IR-luminous galaxies (L_(IR) ≳ 10 ^(11. 6) L_☉) in the local universe (z ≾ 0. 25). Recent studies based on the relation between galaxies' star formation rates and stellar mass (the SFR-M_* relation or the "galaxy main sequence") have suggested that galaxy interaction/mergers may only become significant when galaxies fall well above the galaxy main sequence. Since the typical SFR at a given M_* increases with redshift, the existence of the galaxy main sequence implies that massive, IR-luminous galaxies at high z may not necessarily be driven by galaxy interactions.

The fraction of interacting/merger systems also systematically increases with the deviation from the SFR-M_* relation, supporting the view that galaxies falling above the main sequence are more dominated by mergers than the main-sequence galaxies. Meanwhile, we find that ≳ 18 % of massive IR-luminous "main-sequence galaxies" are classified as interacting systems, where this population may not evolve through the evolutionary track predicted by a simple <b>gas</b> <b>exhaustion</b> model...|$|E
40|$|Background. Seasonal {{as well as}} weekly cycles in suicide {{have been}} described, {{replicated}} and poorly understood for a long time. In Western countries, suicides are typically least frequent on weekends and most frequent on Mondays and Tuesdays. To improve understanding of this phenomenon a strategy is required which focuses on anomalous findings beyond the regular patterns. Here, we focused on instances where the weekly suicide patterns disappear or are interrupted. Methods. We used data from Swiss and Austrian mortality statistics for the periods 1969 - 2010 and 1970 - 2010, respectively. First, the data were cross-tabulated by {{days of the week}} and the available socio-demographic information (sex, age, religious affiliation and region). Second, time series of cumulated daily frequencies of suicide were analysed by seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models which included intervention effects accounting for Easter and Pentecost (Whit) holidays. Results. First, the cross tabulations showed that weekly cycles may be smoothed above all in young persons and smoothed in drowning, jumping and car <b>gas</b> <b>exhaustion</b> suicides. Second, the ARIMA analyses displayed occasional preventive effects for holidays Saturdays and Sundays, and more systematic effects for holiday Mondays. There were no after effects on Tuesdays following holiday Mondays. Conclusions. In general, the weekend dip and the Monday backlog effect in suicide show striking similarities to the Advent season effect and are interpretable within the same template. The turning points between low and high frequencies possibly provide promising frames for the timing of prevention activitie...|$|E

The data indicate that the high specific SF rates (SFRs) of many less massive galaxies do not represent late, irregular or recurrent, starbursts in evolved galaxies. They rather seem to reflect the onset (initial burst) of the dominant SF episode of galaxies, after which SF gradually declines on gigayear timescales to z = 0 and forms the bulk of a galaxy’s M*. With decreasing mass, this onset of major SF shifts to decreasing z for an increasing fraction of galaxies (staged galaxy formation). This process may be {{an important component of the}} “downsizing” phenomenon. We find that the predominantly gradual decline of SFRs described by Noeske et al. can be reproduced by exponential SF histories (τ models), if less massive galaxies have systematically longer e-folding times τ, and a later onset of SF (zf).

40|$|We study galactic star-formation {{activity}} {{as a function}} of environment and stellar mass over 0. 5 9 (9. 5) at z= 1. 3 (2. 0). This method, when applied to a mock catalog with the photometric-redshift precision (σ_z / (1 +z) ≲ 0. 02), recovers galaxies in low- and high-density environments accurately. We quantify the environmental quenching efficiency, and show that at z> 0. 5 it depends on galaxy stellar mass, demonstrating that the effects of quenching related to (stellar) mass and environment are not separable. In high-density environments, the mass and environmental quenching efficiencies are comparable for massive galaxies ((M/M_) ≳ 10. 5) at all redshifts. For lower mass galaxies ((M/M) _) ≲ 10), the environmental quenching efficiency is very low at z≳ 1. 5, but increases rapidly with decreasing redshift. Environmental quenching can account for nearly all quiescent lower mass galaxies ((M/M_) ∼ 9 - 10), which appear primarily at z≲ 1. 0. The morphologies of lower mass quiescent galaxies are inconsistent with those expected of recently quenched star-forming galaxies. Some environmental process must transform the morphologies on similar timescales as the environmental quenching itself. The evolution of the environmental quenching favors models that combine gas starvation (as galaxies become satellites) with <b>gas</b> <b>exhaustion</b> through star-formation and outflows ("overconsumption"), and additional processes such as galaxy interactions, tidal stripping and disk fading to account for the morphological differences between the quiescent and star-forming galaxy populations.

The new data reveal {{for the first}} time spatially resolved CO gas kinematics in the observed SMGs. Two of the SMGs show double or multiple morphologies, with complex, disturbed gas motions. The other two SMGs exhibit CO velocity gradients of ~ 500 km s^− 1 across ≤ 0. 2 " (1. 6 kpc) diameter regions, suggesting that the star-forming gas is in compact, rotating disks. Our data provide compelling evidence that these SMGs represent extreme, short-lived "maximum" star-forming events in highly dissipative mergers of gas-rich galaxies. The resulting high-mass surface and volume densities of SMGs {{are similar to those of}} compact quiescent galaxies in the same redshift range and much higher than those in local spheroids. From the ratio of the comoving volume densities of SMGs and quiescent galaxies in the same mass and redshift ranges, and from the comparison of <b>gas</b> <b>exhaustion</b> timescales and stellar ages, we estimate that the SMG phase duration is about 100 Myr. Our analysis of SMGs and optically/UV selected high-redshift star-forming galaxies supports a "universal" Chabrier IMF as being valid over the star-forming history of these galaxies. We find that the ^(12) CO luminosity to total gas mass conversion factors at z ~ 2 - 3 are probably similar to those assumed at z ~ 0.

40|$|We {{calculate}} the star formation quenching timescales in green valley galaxies at intermediate redshifts (z∼ 0. 5 - 1) using stacked zCOSMOS spectra of different galaxy morphological types: spheroidal, disk-like, irregular and merger, dividing disk-like galaxies further into unbarred, weakly-barred and strongly-barred, assuming a simple exponentially-decaying star formation history model {{and based on}} the H_δ absorption feature and the 4000 Å break. We find that different morphological types present different star formation quenching timescales, reinforcing the idea that the galaxy morphology is strongly correlated with the physical processes responsible for quenching star formation. Our quantification of the star formation quenching timescale indicates that disks have typical timescales 60 % to 5 times longer than that of galaxies presenting spheroidal, irregular or merger morphologies. Barred galaxies in particular present the slowest transition timescales through the green valley. This suggests that although secular evolution may ultimately lead to <b>gas</b> <b>exhaustion</b> in the host galaxy via bar-induced gas inflows that trigger star formation activity, secular agents are not major contributors in the rapid quenching of galaxies at these redshifts. Galaxy interaction, associated with the elliptical, irregular and merger morphologies contribute, to a more significant degree, to the fast transition through the green valley at these redshifts. In the light of previous works suggesting that both secular and merger processes are responsible for the star formation quenching at low redshifts, our results provide an explanation to the recent findings that star formation quenching happened at a faster pace at z∼ 0. 8.

40|$|We use a new {{stacking}} {{technique to}} obtain mean mid IR and far IR to far UV flux ratios {{over the rest}} near-UV/near-IR color-magnitude diagram. We employ COMBO- 17 redshifts and COMBO- 17 optical, GALEX far and near UV, Spitzer IRAC and MIPS Mid IR photometry. This technique permits us to probe infrared excess (IRX), the ratio of far IR to far UV luminosity, and specific star formation rate (SSFR) and their co-evolution over two orders of magnitude of stellar mass and redshift 0. 1 <z< 1. 2. We find that the SSFR and the characteristic mass (M_ 0) above which the SSFR drops increase with redshift (downsizing). At any given epoch, IRX is an increasing function of mass up to M_ 0. Above this mass IRX falls, suggesting <b>gas</b> <b>exhaustion.</b> In a given mass bin below M_ 0 IRX increases with time in a fashion consistent with enrichment. We interpret these trends using a simple model with a Schmidt-Kennicutt law and extinction that tracks gas density and enrichment. We find that the average IRX and SSFR follows a galaxy age parameter which is determined mainly by the galaxy mass and time since formation. We conclude that blue sequence galaxies have properties which show simple, systematic trends with mass and time such as the steady build-up of heavy elements in the interstellar media of evolving galaxies and the exhaustion of gas in galaxies that are evolving off the blue sequence. The IRX represents a tool for selecting galaxies at various stages of evolution. Comment: Accepted for publication in GALEX Special Ap. J. Suppl., December, 200...|$|E
40|$|We {{performed}} {{a series of}} 29 gasdynamical simulations of disc galaxies, barred and unbarred, with various stellar masses, to study {{the impact of the}} bar on star formation history. Unbarred galaxies evolve very smoothly, with a star formation rate (SFR) that varies by at most a factor of three over a period of 2 Gyr. The evolution of barred galaxies is much more irregular, especially at high stellar masses. In these galaxies, the bar drives a substantial amount of gas toward the centre, resulting in a high SFR, and producing a starburst in the most massive galaxies. Most of the gas is converted into stars, and <b>gas</b> <b>exhaustion</b> leads to a rapid drop of star formation after the starburst. In massive barred galaxies (stellar mass M* > 2 x 10 ^ 10 Msun) the large amount of gas funnelled toward the centre is completely consumed by the starburst, while in lower-mass barred galaxies it is only partially consumed. Gas concentration is thus higher in lower-mass barred galaxies than it is in higher-mass ones. Even though unbarred galaxies funnelled less gas toward their centre, the lower SFR allows this gas to accumulate. At late times, the star formation efficiency is higher in barred galaxies than unbarred ones, enabling these galaxies to maintain a higher SFR with a smaller gas supply. Several properties, such as the global SFR, central SFR, or central gas concentration, vary monotonically with time for unbarred galaxies, but not for barred galaxies. Therefore one must be careful when comparing barred and unbarred galaxies that share one observational property, since these galaxies might be at very different stages of their respective evolution.

They appear as unresolved "Little Blue Dots" (LBDs). They are less massive and have higher sSFR than "blueberries" studied by yang et al. (2017) and higher sSFR than "Blue Nuggets" studied by Tacchella et al. (2016). We divided the LBDs into 3 redshift bins and, for each, stacked the B 435, V 606, and I 814 images convolved to the same stellar point spread function (PSF). Their radii were determined from PSF deconvolution to be ~ 80 to ~ 180 pc. The high sSFR suggest that their entire stellar mass has formed in only 1 % of the local age of the universe. The sSFRs at similar epochs in local dwarf galaxies are lower {{by a factor of}} ~ 100. Assuming that the star formation rate is epsilon_ff M_gas/t_ff for efficiency epsilon_ff, gas mass M_gas, and free fall time, t_ff, the gas mass and gas-to-star mass ratio are determined. This ratio exceeds 1 for reasonable efficiencies, and is likely to be ~ 5 even with a high epsilon_ff of 0. 1. We consider whether these regions are forming today's globular clusters. With their observed stellar masses, the maximum likely cluster mass is ~ 10 ^ 5 M_sun, but if star formation continues at the current rate for ~ 10 t_ff~ 50 Myr before feedback and <b>gas</b> <b>exhaustion</b> stop it, then the maximum cluster mass could become ~ 10 ^ 6 M_sun.

40|$|A {{study of}} CO and FIR {{emission}} in a distance limited (z< 0. 03) complete sample of Hickson Compact Group (HCG) galaxies {{was conducted in}} order {{to examine the effects of}} their unique environment on the ISM and star formation activity. Ubiquitous tidal interactions in these dense groups would predict enhanced activities among the HCG galaxies compared to isolated galaxies. Instead their CO and FIR properties are surprisingly similar to isolated spirals. The CO data for 80 HCG galaxies presented here indicate that the spirals globally show the same H 2 content as the isolated comparison sample, although 20 % are deficient in CO emission. The CO deficiency appears linked with the group evolution, and <b>gas</b> <b>exhaustion</b> through past star formation and removal of external gas reserve by tidal stripping of the outer HI disk offer a possible explanation. The IRAS data for the entire sample of 161 HCG galaxies were re-analyzed using ADDSCAN/SCANPI, improving the sensitivity by a factor of 3 - 5 over the existing Point Source Catalog (PSC) and better resolving the contribution from individual galaxies. We find that FIR emission in HCG galaxies is similar to isolated, Virgo cluster, and weakly interacting galaxies. A factor two enhancement in the 25 micr/ 100 micr flux ratio among the HCG spirals is found, which suggests intense, localized nuclear starburst activity similar to HII galaxies. A number of early-type galaxies in HCGs are detected in CO and FIR, lending further support to the idea that tidal interactions and tidally induced evolution of the groups and member galaxies are important in our sample.

40|$|Abridged) AVOCADO aims at {{establishing}} firm conclusions on {{the formation}} and evolution of dwarf galaxies by constructing and analysing a homogeneous, multiwavelength dataset for a statistically significant sample of approximately 6500 nearby dwarfs (M_i > - 18 mag). We present the sample selection criteria and describe the suite of analysis tools, some of them developed {{in the framework of}} the Virtual Observatory. We make use of optical spectra and UV-to-NIR imaging of the dwarf sample to derive SFRs, stellar masses, ages and metallicities - which are further supplemented with structural parameters that are used to classify them morphologically. This dataset, coupled with a detailed characterisation of each dwarf's environment, allows for a fully comprehensive investigation of their origins and to track the potential evolutionary paths between the different dwarf types. We characterise the local environment of all dwarfs in our sample, paying special attention to trends with current star formation activity. We find that virtually all quiescent dwarfs are located in the vicinity (projected distances < 1. 5 Mpc) of L* companions, consistent with recent results. While star-forming dwarfs are preferentially found at separations of the order of 1 Mpc, {{there appears to be a}} tail towards low separations (< 100 kpc) in the distribution of projected distances. We speculate that, modulo projection effects, this probably represents a genuine population of late-type dwarfs caught upon first infall about their host and before environmental quenching has fully operated. In this context, these results suggest that internal mechanisms -such as <b>gas</b> <b>exhaustion</b> via star formation or feedback effects- are not sufficient to completely cease the star formation activity in dwarf galaxies, and that becoming the satellite of a massive central galaxy appears to be a necessary condition to create a quiescent dwarf.
