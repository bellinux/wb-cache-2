In this line, an extension of Cox proportional hazard model into two sexes is proposed. The basic assumption is that the marital hazard {{of male and female}} characteristics (i,j) is proportional to that of reference combination (0, 0). Two-sex partial likelihood function is defined by taking not an individual but a pair of male and female as the unit of analysis. The maximum likelihood estimator can be obtained by optimizing the function. Tied data can be treated {{in the same way as}} the one-sex model.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{relationship}} between characteristics of men’s place of residence and the probability of entering marriage in western Germany during the 1980 s and 1990 s. We link micro-information from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (GSOEP) with district-level data to estimate discrete-time multilevel logit models. Our results support the widely accepted idea {{about the importance of}} men’s individual economic status in marital decisions. They furthermore indicate a negative relationship between women’s aggregate labor force participation and male transition rates to marriage, which could be interpreted as evidence for the popular ‘economic independence hypothesis’ of marital behavior. Complementary, we put forward an interpretation of female employment rates as indicators of a region’s degree of secularization, for example. Consistent with a previous study on <b>female</b> <b>nuptiality</b> in Germany, our findings (which also include a significant latent contextual effect) suggest that a man’s propensity to marry is influenced by the regional socio-cultural milieu he lives in. demography of men, Germany, multilevel analysis, nuptiality...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} fertility, using panel data for twenty-seven European countries. We employ panel co-integration to estimate fertility as function of demographic and economic variables. We show that low fertility in most industrialized countries in Europe is due to low infant mortality rates, high <b>female</b> employment, low <b>nuptiality</b> rate and high opportunity cost of having children. Using two measures of economic uncertainty, which are associated with labor market decisions - a production (an output) volatility measure and the unemployment rate - we examine to what extent economic insecurities affect fertility decisions. The empirical results show that both measures of economic uncertainty have a significant negative impact on fertility implying that labor market insecurities might be a significant factor affecting fertility decisions.

40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine Omani {{patterns}} of <b>female</b> <b>nuptiality,</b> includingthe timing of marriage and determinants of age at a woman’s first marriage. Methods: The study utilised data fromthe 2000 Oman National Health Survey. Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate statistical methods, including logistic regression analysis, were used for data analysis. Results: One of the most important aspects of the marriage pattern in Oman is the high prevalence of consanguineous marriages, as more than half (52 %) of the total marriages in Oman are consanguineous. First cousin unions are the most common type of consanguineous unions, constituting 39 % of all marriages and 75 % of all consanguineous marriages. About 11 % of the marriages are polygynous. Earlyand universal marriage is still highly prevalent in Oman. Three-quarters (75 %) of married women respondents aged 20 – 44 years were married by age 20, with their median age at their first wedding being 16 years. However, women’s average age upon marriage is gradually increasing. The change is especially apparent in more recent marriages or among younger cohorts of women, and for certain socio-cultural groups. Multivariate analysis identified female education, age cohort, residential status, region of residence, types of marriage, and employment as strong predictors of Omani women’s age at marriage. Conclusion: The growing number of young adults, accompanied by their tendency to delay marriage, may have serious demographic, social, economic, and political ramifications for Oman, highlighting the need to understand the new situation of youth, their unique characteristics, and their interests and demands. Culturally appropriate policies need to be implemented to address the issues and challenges of unmarried young adults...|$|E
