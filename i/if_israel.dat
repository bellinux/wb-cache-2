25|$|During {{the period}} of {{negotiations}} and threats following the invasion, Saddam focused renewed attention on the Palestinian problem by promising to withdraw his forces from Kuwait <b>if</b> <b>Israel</b> would relinquish the occupied territories in the West Bank, the Golan Heights, and the Gaza Strip. Saddam's proposal further split the Arab world, pitting U.S.- and Western-supported Arab states against the Palestinians. The allies ultimately rejected any linkage between the Kuwait crisis and Palestinian issues.|$|E
50|$|Strategically, Israel's {{long-range}} missiles, nuclear-capable aircraft, {{and possibly}} its submarines present an effective second strike deterrence against unconventional and conventional attack, and <b>if</b> <b>Israel's</b> defences fail and its population centers are threatened, the Samson Option, an all-out attack against an adversary, would be employed.

25|$|In October 2009, Asharq Al-Awsat {{reported}} that a senior Israeli defense official had told the newspaper that Israel knew exactly where Shalit was being held, and was keeping the location under constant surveillance. The newspaper {{reported that}} Hamas was aware that Israel knew Shalit's location, and responded by booby-trapping the area, surrounding it with explosives in a 400–500-meter radius, and issuing a directive to kill Shalit <b>if</b> <b>Israel</b> mounted a military rescue operation.|$|E

The United States, meanwhile, has agreed that <b>if</b> <b>Israel</b> buys more F-35 squadrons from later production series, the installation of more Israeli-made systems will be allowed. To sweeten the deal, Lockheed Martin said it would buy parts and systems for the F-35 from Israeli companies {{at a cost of}} $4 billion. The aircraft will be designated F-35I, as there will be unique Israeli features installed in them.|$|E

25|$|In Israel, it was {{increasingly}} debated whether {{the presence of}} Israeli forces in southern Lebanon was working, since {{it was clear that}} the 'security zone' could not stop Hezbollah rockets reaching into Israel. After heavy Israeli casualties in south lebanon, some Israeli politicians argued that the conflict would only end <b>if</b> <b>Israel</b> withdrew from Lebanon. In 2000 Ehud Barak finally withdrew Israeli forces from Lebanon. Following the Israeli withdrawal, the South Lebanon Army, which was supported by Israel, was quickly overrun by Hezbollah. Some SLA members escaped to Israel, but many were captured by Hezbollah. This success against Israel greatly increased Hezbollah's popularity within Lebanon and the Islamic world.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, American {{intellectual}} Noam Chomsky argued that Israeli {{claims that the}} Palestinian leadership rejected the international consensus calling for a Palestinian state, with borders along the Green Line, were {{not consistent with the}} documented record. In 2008 Al Jazeera and Haaretz both reported that elements in the Palestinian leadership, even inside Hamas, have called for a two-state settlement based on the pre-June 1967 borders (the Green Line). Although Hamas' official policy is committed to Israel's destruction, Ismail Haniya, the prime minister of the Palestinian unity government until June 2007, suggested that a long-term truce with Israel could be achieved <b>if</b> <b>Israel</b> withdrew from territory occupied in 1967.|$|E

On 25 October Eden told the Cabinet that Israel would attack Egypt after all, but did not tell them about the secret Sevres Protocol. Cabinet minutes record that Macleod was doubtful about {{the use of force}} (as were Monckton and Heathcoat Amory) {{because of the lack of}} clear UN authority and the risk of antagonising the USA. However, they did not formally dissent from the Cabinet decision to invade <b>if</b> <b>Israel</b> attacked Egypt (the Cabinet were deceived about the extent to which such an attack had already been secretly agreed – “collusion” – by Eden and Selwyn Lloyd).|$|E
25|$|Obama had not {{specified}} what his approach would be, {{although it was}} considered likely that he would appoint a high-level Middle East envoy, in part to free his Secretary of State so that other matters can also be addressed. Hamas expressed a willingness to talk to Obama, who {{has said that he}} will reciprocate only if it renounces terrorism, recognizes Israel's right to exist, and agrees to abide by past agreements. The Hamas leader in Gaza, Ismail Haniyeh, has said the Hamas government would accept a Palestinian state that followed the Green Line and would offer Israel a long-term truce <b>if</b> <b>Israel</b> recognises the Palestinians' national rights.|$|E
25|$|After {{meeting with}} other militant groups, Hamas agreed {{to enforce a}} ceasefire <b>if</b> <b>Israel</b> stopped firing, but both sides {{continued}} to fire. The Israeli Air Force bombed two smuggling tunnels in the northern Gaza Strip, injuring four people. Rocket and mortar fire from Gaza began a few hours later, and at least 45 additional Palestinian projectiles were fired into Israel over a three-hour period. No one was killed, but residents were instructed to stay inside their homes, children were ordered to stay inside schools, and police sealed roads {{in the area for}} fear of additional attacks. One mortar shell damaged a home in the Eshkol Regional Council, but caused no injuries. A Grad rocket fired at Ashkelon was intercepted by an Iron Dome battery, marking the first successful interception of a short-range rocket in history. Immediately afterward, an Israeli aircraft fired at the militant squad that had launched the rocket, and confirmed a hit.|$|E

This followed more ambiguous threats from Iran's oil minister and other government officials that an attack on Iran would result in turmoil in the world's oil supply.|$|R
2500|$|On the {{question}} of whether the U.S. Embassy in Israel in Tel Aviv should be moved to Jerusalem, Romney said in October 2011, [...] "The actions that I will take will be actions recommended and supported by Israeli leaders. I don’t seek to take actions independent of what our allies think is best, and <b>if</b> <b>Israel’s</b> leaders thought that a move of that nature would be helpful to their efforts, then that’s something I’ll be inclined to do.... I don’t think America should play the role of the leader of the peace process, instead we should stand by our ally." [...] During a trip to Israel in July 2012, he reiterated that if elected president he would seek to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which he called the capital of Israel (and which he has said the U.S. should formally recognize as the capital of Israel, although Palestinians and other Arabs also claim Jerusalem as the capital of a Palestinian state), if the government of Israel desired such a move.|$|R
25|$|In August 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait, {{triggering}} the Gulf War between Iraq {{and a large}} allied force, led by the United States. Iraq attacked Israel with 39 Scud missiles. Israel did not retaliate at {{request of}} the U.S., fearing that <b>if</b> <b>Israel</b> responded against Iraq, other Arab nations might desert the allied coalition. Israel provided gas masks for both the Palestinian population and Israeli citizens, while Netherlands and the United States deployed Patriot defense batteries in Israel as protection against the Scuds. In May 1991, during a 36-hour period, 15,000 Beta Israel (Ethiopian Jews) were secretly airlifted to Israel. The coalition's victory in the Gulf War opened new possibilities for regional peace, and in October 1991 the U.S. President, George H.W. Bush, and Soviet Union Premier, Mikhail Gorbachev, jointly convened a historic meeting in Madrid of Israeli, Lebanese, Jordanian, Syrian, and Palestinian leaders. Shamir opposed the idea but agreed in return for loan guarantees to help with absorption of immigrants from the former Soviet Union.

Militarily, Jordan is a pushover, having a very small army, although exceptionally with a very large air force.

500|$|On 21 May, Amer asked Nasser {{to order}} the Straits of Tiran blockaded, a move Nasser {{believed}} Israel would use as a casus belli. Amer reassured him that the army was prepared for confrontation, but Nasser doubted Amer's assessment of the military's readiness. According to Nasser's vice president Zakaria Mohieddin, although [...] "Amer had absolute authority over the armed forces, Nasser had his ways of knowing what was really going on". Moreover, Amer anticipated an impending Israeli attack and advocated a preemptive strike. Nasser refused the call upon determination {{that the air force}} lacked pilots and Amer's handpicked officers were incompetent. Still, Nasser concluded that <b>if</b> <b>Israel</b> attacked, Egypt's quantitative advantage in manpower and arms could stave off Israeli forces for at least two weeks, allowing for diplomacy towards a ceasefire. Towards the end of May, Nasser increasingly exchanged his positions of deterrence for deference to the inevitability of war, under increased pressure to act by both the general Arab populace and various Arab governments. On 26 May Nasser declared, [...] "our basic objective will be to destroy Israel". On 30 May, King Hussein committed Jordan in an alliance with Egypt and Syria.|$|E

Fearing that the United States would be wary of intervening <b>if</b> <b>Israel</b> were perceived as initiating the hostilities, Meir decided early on October 6 against a preemptive strike. She made it a priority to inform Washington of her decision.
