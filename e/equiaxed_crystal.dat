The grain growth, solid-liquid interface movement, and columnar-to-equiaxed transition (CET) in the continuous casting process can be reproduced using this equipment. The current study {{is focused on the}} effects of different cooling rates and superheat conditions on the grain growth in the solidification process of chromium-saving ferritic stainless steel (B 425). The temperature distribution and microstructure evolution are simulated by a Cellular Automaton-Finite Element (CAFE) model. The experimental results demonstrate that the temperature gradient and the grain growth rate of the sample can be effectively controlled by the equipment. It is observed from optical micrographs of the microstructure that the average equiaxed grain ratio increases when the superheat temperature decreases. The average equiaxed grain ratio is approximately 26 % and 42 % under superheat conditions of 40 °C and 30 °C, respectively, and no apparent columnar grain generation in the samples occurs under superheat conditions of 10 °C and 20 °C, {{as the result of a}} large thermal resistance at the copper-sample interface and low superheat inside the sample. A lower cooling rate results in a higher <b>equiaxed</b> <b>crystal</b> ratio in the sample. As the cooling rate decreases, the <b>equiaxed</b> <b>crystal</b> ratio becomes 14 %, 23 %, and 42 %.

A jump in the electrical conductivity between the liquid and solid causes the current density to be non uniform. In both cases the resulting Lorentz force drives fluid flow in the liquid phase, this in turn causes advection of the thermal and solute field altering the free energy close to the interface and changing the morphology of the dendrite.

The effect of the super-gravity field on grain refining was remarkable, and the relationship could be well fitted by the second-decreasing-exponential function. For aluminum, the grain size decreased rapidly as the gravity coefficient increased from 1 to 250, and then remained nearly unchanged from 250 to 1000. Under the experimental conditions, the main mechanism was that the fragments of dendritic grains-generated by super-gravity-acted as the nucleation sites and resulted in grain refining. Further, the change of nucleation Gibbs free energy, directly caused by super-gravity, was not remarkable enough to refine the grains, which could be suggested by the stable freezing points under different super-gravity fields...|$|E

The main features of mixed columnar-equiaxed solidification in such an ingot can be quantitatively modelled: growth of columnar dendrite trunks; nucleation, growth and sedimentation of equiaxed crystals; thermosolutal convection of the melt; solute transport by both convection and crystal sedimentation; and the columnar-to-equiaxed transition (CET). The predicted as-cast macrostructure and the segregation pattern are in qualitative agreement with the reported experimental results. Parameter study on the numerical grid size and the nucleation of the <b>equiaxed</b> <b>crystals</b> are performed, and some segregation mechanisms are numerically analyzed. Discontinued positive–negative segregation just below the hot top is predicted because of the formation of a local mini-ingot and the subsequent sedimentation of equiaxed grains within the mini-ingot.

The quasi A-segregates originate from the flow instability, but both the appearance of <b>equiaxed</b> <b>crystals</b> and their interaction with the growing columnar dendrite tips significantly strengthen the segregates. The appearance of equiaxed phase is not a necessary condition for the formation of quasi A-segregates.

This study is to use this model to analyze the role of fragmentation in the formation of as-cast structure. Test simulations are made for the solidification of a model alloy (Sn- 10 wt. %Pb) with two different geometries. The first one is a 2 D rectangular domain (50 × 60 mm 2) as cooled from the top boundary. Solidification starts unidirectionally as columnar structure from the top. The solute (Pb) enriched interdendritic melt is heavier than the bulk melt, and sinks downwards, hence leads to solutal convection. Fragmentation phenomenon occurs near the columnar tip front. The fragments are transported out of the columnar region, and they continue to grow and sink, and finally settle down and pile up at the bottom. The growing columnar structure from the top and pile-up of <b>equiaxed</b> <b>crystals</b> from the bottom finally lead to a mixed columnar-equiaxed structure, in turn leading to a columnar-to-equiaxed transition (CET). The second geometry is a 3 D plate, 100 × 60 × 10 mm 3, as cooled laterally from one side. It was cast experimentally and analyzed for the as-cast structure. The equiaxed fragments are produced in the solidification front and transported into the bulk melt, leading to a special pattern of as-cast structure: columnar structure in the cool wall side and equiaxed structure in the upper left corner near the hot wall side, extending downwards to the middle bottom region.
