2500|$|While [...] "wrongful" [...] {{dismissal}} concerns breaches of {{the terms}} of an employment contract, [...] "unfair" [...] dismissal is a claim based on the Employment Rights Act 1996 sections 94 to 134A. It governs the reasons for which an employer terminates a contract, and requires they fall into the statutory definition of what is [...] "fair". The Industrial Relations Act 1971, following the Donovan Report 1968, set up its structure. Under ERA 1996 section 94 any employee, who is employed for over two years, may claim for an Employment Tribunal (composed of a judge, an employer and an employee representative) to review the decision. Temporary or seasonal breaks in employment, such as for teachers who are not in class over summer, cannot break the continuity of the contract for the qualifying period, even if a contract purports to be for a fixed term. An employee is only [...] "dismissed" [...] if the employer has decided to end the work relationship, or if they have constructively dismissed the employee through a serious breach of mutual trust and confidence. An employee will not have a claim if they have voluntarily resigned, though a court must be satisfied that someone truly intended to forgo the legal right to sue for unfair dismissal. In Kwik-Fit (GB) Ltd v Lineham Mr Lineham used the toilet at work after drinking at the pub. Afterwards, in response to the manager rebuking him in front of other staff, he threw down his keys and drove off. He claimed he was dismissed, and the Tribunal agreed that at no time had Mr Lineham resigned. By contrast in Western Excavating (ECC) Ltd v Sharp Mr Sharp walked off because the company welfare officer refused to let him collect holiday pay immediately. Although Mr Sharp was in financial difficulty, this was due to his absences, and so he was not justified in leaving, and not constructively dismissed. Under ERA 1996 section 203(1), statutory rights may not be excluded or limited, although section 203(2) and (3) still allows employers and employees to settle a legal claim, so long as the compromise agreement is made freely and with independent legal advice. It has also been held that an employee is not dismissed if the relationship is frustrated. In Notcutt v Universal Equipment Co (London) Ltd a man's heart attack meant he could no longer work. The employer paid no wages during the ordinary notice period, but was successful in arguing that the contract was impossible to perform and therefore void. This doctrine, applicable as a default rule in <b>general</b> <b>contract</b> law, is controversial since unlike commercial parties it will be rare that an employee has the foresight or ability to contract around the rule. The Supreme Court recently emphasised in Gisda Cyf v Barratt that the [...] "need to segregate intellectually common law principles relating to contract law, even in the field of employment, from statutorily conferred rights is fundamental." [...] This meant that when an employee claimed unfair dismissal, after accusations of allegedly inappropriate behaviour at a private party, the three month time limit for her claim only began running when the employer had actually notified her. The <b>general</b> <b>contract</b> law principle that notifications take effect when arriving during business hours was not even [...] "a preliminary guide" [...] to the interpretation of the right to a fair dismissal.|$|E

5000|$|<b>General</b> <b>contracting</b> was {{introduced}} in the building trades in the 1820s in Britain. <b>General</b> <b>contracting</b> reorganized the bidding process by which construction contracts were awarded, and in so doing, challenged the master-journeyman system. <b>General</b> <b>contracting</b> began in the British “Office of Public Works” during the Napoleonic Wars; they obtained competitive tenders for the whole project by a single builder at fixed cost for the first time. This was a means by which they could limit their liability for cost overruns. By 1825, the system became common in the northwest of England, resulting in a steep fall in wages. [...] <b>General</b> <b>contracting</b> {{was introduced}} in Upper Canada in the construction of public works such as the new parliament buildings in Toronto, beginning in 1829. [...] This placed the project {{in the hands of a}} single master builder who subcontracted portions of the project to the other trades. Rather than “job” the work to a subcontractor, the general contractor would provide his own building materials, hiring masters and their journeymen as labour only. By limiting “jobbing,” the general contractors also eroded the traditional measures by which these jobs were costed. This gave the general contractor more profit, and the masters less.The general contractors had no interests in perpetuating the master-journeyman system and its traditional standards of payment, and abused the apprenticeship system by hiring unqualified workmen. <b>General</b> <b>contracting</b> was clearly an issue in Toronto as early as 1831 when the members of the United Amicable Trade and Benefit Society of Journeymen Bricklayers, Plasterers and Masons rejected the <b>general</b> <b>contracting</b> system.|$|R
