40|$|Both {{yogurt and}} pasteurized liquid milk {{was made from}} whole cow’s milk which was {{fortified}} with <b>ferrous</b> <b>bisglycinate,</b> ferrous lactate and ferrous sulfate microencapsulate. Yogurt was stored for 7 days and milk for 2 days before consumer acceptance sensory tests was done. Chemical analysis was done every 5 days for yogurt and every 3 days for pasteurized milk. Sensory mean scores show {{that there were no}} significant differences between the control yogurt and yogurt fortified with ferrous sulfate microencapsulate in appearance, flavor, mouthfeel and overall preference. Significant differences (p < 0. 05) were observed between control yogurt and yogurt fortified with <b>ferrous</b> <b>bisglycinate</b> and yogurt fortified with ferrous lactate. The observation was different in milk where no significant differences were observed in appearance and flavor in all treatments while control milk and milk fortified with ferrous lactate showed no significant differences in taste. Both Thiobarbituric Acid (TBA) and Peroxide Value (PV) numbers were highest in yogurt and pasteurized milk fortified with ferrous sulfate microencapsulate. Control yogurt had the lowest TBA value. PV was lowest in yogurt fortified with ferrous lactate while pasteurized milk has low PV in control. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{major cause}} of iron {{deficiency}} in human body isthe low intake of iron from foods. One of strategy to overcome the iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in Indonesia is iron fortification to soya-based food. Phytic acid {{is a compound that}} presents in soy-based food and inhibits iron adsorption in digestion thus increasing iron deficiency. Iron fortification is one method to increase iron content in food. In this research, FeSO 4. 7 H 2 O (1), <b>ferrous</b> <b>bisglycinate</b> (2) and Na-glycinate+FeSO 4. 7 H 2 O (3) were used as fortificants into three soy-based foods (i. e., soya milk, tempeh, and tofu. The addition of fortificant amount was performed based on the molar ratio of phytic acid contained to iron. The results shows that fortification using ferrous bisglycinateis the most effective compound compared to single compound FeSO 4. 7 H 2 O and the mixture of Na-glycine and FeSO 47 H 2 O. The effectiveness of fortification on soya milk of fortificant 1, 2 and 3 are 48 %, 55 %, and 33 % respectively, whereas on tempeh are 74 %, 86 %, and 56 % respectively and for tofu are 51 %, 55 %, and 46 % respectively. It indicates that <b>ferrous</b> <b>bisglycinate</b> has ability to prevent iron phytate formation due to its character as a chelating agent...|$|E
40|$|The World Health Organization ranked it as {{the seventh}} most {{important}} preventable risk for disease, disability, and death in 2002 [2]. Since {{an important factor in}} its causation is the poor bioavailability of iron in the cereal-based diets of many developing countries, SUSTAIN set up a Task Force, consisting of nutritional, medical, industry, and government experts to consider strategies for enhancing the absorption of fortification iron. This paper sum-marizes the findings of this Task Force. Detailed reviews of each strategy follow this overview. Highly soluble compounds of iron like ferrous sulfate are desirable food fortificants but cannot be used in many food vehicles because of sensory issues. Thus, potentially less well-absorbed forms of iron commonly are used in food fortification. The bioavailability of iron fortificants can, however, be enhanced with innovative in-gredient technologies. Ascorbic acid, NaFeEDTA, <b>ferrous</b> <b>bisglycinate,</b> and dephytinization all enhance the ab-sorption of fortification iron, but add to the overall costs of fortification. While all strategies cannot be recom...|$|E
40|$|Background: Iron {{deficiency}} anaemia {{in women}} of reproductive age {{group is a}} major health problem in India. Objective: The present {{study was designed to}} compare the efficacy, tolerability, and cost, of three oral iron preparations among the anaemic pregnant women (n= 6 o) of gestation (12 - 24 weeks). Methodology: The patients were divided into 3 groups (n= 20) and treated with ferrous fumarate(100 mg), <b>ferrous</b> <b>bisglycinate</b> (100 mg),and carbonyl iron(100 mg) respectively. Follow-up was done for 3 months. Haemoglobin gm%, mean corpuscular volume and reticulocyte count were assessed at 0, 1, 2, 3 months and serum ferritin at 0 and 3 months. Adverse effects were monitored and cost analysis was done at end of three months. Results: Significant increase in Hb was seen in all three groups (p< 0. 001) but, no significant difference was found between three treatments in relation to increase in Hb. Increase in ferritin with ferrous fumarate was significantly more than other treatments (p< 0. 05). Nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain was significantly more with ferrous fumarate but patient compliance was not affected due to them. Ferrous fumarate was the cheapest amongst all three treatments. Conclusion: It can be concluded that, ferrous fumarate still can be considered best cost effective medication with tolerable side effects for treatment as well as prevention of iron deficiency anaemia in pregnancy...|$|E
40|$|Background: About {{one half}} of school-age {{children}} in developing countries {{are estimated to be}} affected by iron deficiency. Failure to treat micronutrient deficiencies can negatively affect health and economic development. Objective: To determine the effect of multiple micronutrient maize-based liquid meal supplement on the iron status and the nutritional status of primary school children. Design: A randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial was conducted. Setting and subjects: The study took place at Sunnyside Primary School in Sunnyside, Pretoria, in the urban area of Tshwane (Gauteng Province, South Africa). Grades 3 and 4 male and female learners aged 8 - 12 years, enrolled in the 2010 academic year were recruited for the study. Methods: Participants were dewormed, to eliminate parasitic infestaion {{at the beginning of the}} study. The experimental product was a maize-based liquid meal supplement enriched with macronutrients and micronutrients including chelated <b>ferrous</b> <b>bisglycinate,</b> while the control had the same macronutrient profile but no added micronutrients. The learners took the meal supplement every morning on school days for 14 weeks. Iron status was measured by Haemoglobin (Hb) levels and the nutritional status was measured by anthropometric measures at baseline and end. Groups were compared with respect to change in Hb and change in anthropometry using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with baseline Hb values as covariate. Testing was done at the 0. 05 level of significance. Results: There was no significant difference in the Hb levels at baseline (12. 6 ± 1. 1 g/dL and 12. 8 ± 1. 1 g/dL) (P = 0. 250) between the experimental and control groups respectively. The prevalence of mild anemia (Hb< 11 g/dL) was low in both the experimental and control groups. Over the 14 weeks study period, consumption of experimental products was similar and there was no significant effect on Hb levels of the participants observed (P = 0. 806) in the experimental and control groups. There was also no significant change observed in the anthropometry of the participants. Conclusion: The maize-based liquid meal supplement enriched with multiple micronutrients did not have a significant effect on the iron status of the participants in this study, possibly owing to low prevalence of anemia, a low rate of consumption and therefore iron absorption.
