40|$|Environmental and {{financial}} imperatives {{have led to}} an increasing demand of <b>green</b> <b>concretes.</b> In this master thesis, concretes with high substitution rates of cement are considered in order to decrease their carbon footprint. More precisely, the studied binders are composed of variable rates of cement, blast furnace slag and limestone filler. Even though {{the use of the}} latter is promising, its effects on concrete properties still remain quite indefinite. Therefore, its influence on hydration reaction, setting, workability and mechanical strength at early age of concrete are thoroughly studied. To this end, a sequence of experiments of isothermal and adiabatic calorimetry, mechanical strength and ultra-sonic measurement of the setting are carried out. This study confirms the accelerating effect of limestone filler additions on setting and highlights its impact on the workability of concrete. Finally, it shows that substitution rates of over 75 % of cement with 30 % to 40 % of limestone filler, can meet construction site requirements. info:eu-repo/semantics/nonPublishe...|$|R

40|$|Concrete {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{construction}} materials in the world. Chemical admixtures are ingredients added to concrete to enhance its properties. However, most chemical admixtures on the market today are expensive, thereby making them out of reach for small consumers of concrete. In Africa, use of chemical admixtures is rare despite the harsh weather conditions. In the current study, Gum from Acacia karroo (GAK) was used as a water-reducing admixture in concrete. A slump test, density and compressive strength were studied using different dosages of GAK while neat concrete was the control. Results showed that slump increased by 200 % at a 2 % dosage of GAK. This enabled reduction of water-to-binder (w/b) ratio from 0. 61 to 0. 48 for samples with a 3 % dosage. Reduction in w/b resulted in increased compressive strength of 37. 03 % above the control after 180 days of curing for a 3 % dosage. XRD studies also showed a decreased rate of hydration in the presence of GAK in concrete. It was concluded that GAK can be used in concrete as a water-reducing admixture, which is environmentally-friendly, thus producing sustainable and <b>greener</b> <b>concrete...</b>|$|R

40|$|As {{the most}} widely used {{manufactured}} material on Earth, concrete poses serious societal and environmental concerns which call for innovative strategies to develop <b>greener</b> <b>concrete</b> with improved strength and toughness, properties that are exclusive in man-made materials. Herein, we focus on calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H), the major binding phase of all Portland cement concretes, and study how engineering its nanovoids and portlandite particle inclusions can impart a balance of strength, toughness and stiffness. By performing an extensive + 600 molecular dynamics simulations coupled with statistical analysis tools, our results provide new evidence of ductile fracture mechanisms in C-S-H – reminiscent of crystalline alloys and ductile metals – decoding the interplay between the crack growth, nanovoid/particle inclusions, and stoichiometry, which dictates the crystalline versus amorphous nature of the underlying matrix. We found that introduction of voids and portlandite particles can significantly increase toughness and ductility, specially in C-S-H with more amorphous matrices, mainly owing to competing mechanisms of crack deflection, voids coalescence, internal necking, accommodation, and geometry alteration of individual voids/particles, which together regulate toughness versus strength. Furthermore, utilizing a comprehensive global sensitivity analysis on random configuration-property relations, we show that the mean diameter of voids/particles is the most critical statistical parameter influencing the mechanical properties of C-S-H, irrespective of stoichiometry or crystalline or amorphous nature of the matrix. This study provides new fundamental insights, design guidelines, and de novo strategies to turn the brittle C-S-H into a ductile material, impacting modern engineering of strong and tough concrete infrastructures and potentially other complex brittle materials...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{the field of}} {{supplementary}} cementitious materials (SCM) for so-called <b>green</b> <b>concretes,</b> and their influence on {{the properties of the}} hardened cement matrix and the corrosion of embedded steel, is discussed. Cements with such a modified composition achieve a greater economic effect due to better utilization of the raw materials and energy needed for their manufacture. During the performed investigations, the basic materials for the production of cement were first dried and mechanically treated. They were then mixed together in the selected proportions and ground into six different cements. After the specific surface area, density, chemical composition, and chlorides content in the cements had been determined, mortar samples for testing were prepared. After a curing period of twenty-eight days the flexural strength, compressive strength, and static modulus of elasticity of the test specimens were determined. They were then exposed to accelerated chloride induced corrosion, and electrochemical measurements were performed by means of three different methods for monitoring and detecting changes in the state of corrosion of steel in concrete. With potentiostatic method the corrosion current densities at increased potential were followed according to adopted standard method. With electrochemical impedance spectroscopy the corrosion activity in 22 -week period on samples immersed into chloride solution and on samples that were cyclically exposed to wet and dry conditions was measured. The resistance to capillary absorption and the porosity of the samples were determined. After completion of the investigations, the samples were longitudinally split into two pieces, and a visual inspection of the reinforcement surface was carried out. The acid-soluble and water-soluble chloride contents were determined for the specimens investigated according to the third method. Finally, the suitability and reliability of the methods used for monitoring and detecting changes in the state of corrosion of steel in concrete, based on visual inspection and the results of electrochemical measurements, were assessed...|$|R
