This can be calculated according to the formula (known as the Vir Narain formula) as follows:where C is the distance from the Critical Point (<b>equitime</b> <b>point)</b> to the destination, D the distance between the destination and the alternate airfield, O is the groundspeed, A is the airspeed, θ = Φ +/- d (where Φ is the angle between the track to the destination and the track from the destination to the alternate airfield), and d is the drift (plus when the drift and the alternate airfield are on the opposite sides of the track, and minus when they are on the same side).|$|E
