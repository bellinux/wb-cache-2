25|$|Lurie's {{response}} {{after reading}} Merrill and Jackson's collaborative effort in The Changing Light at Sandover: “I sometimes <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> my friend's mind was intermittently being {{taken over by}} a stupid and possibly even evil intelligence”. According to Stoker Hunt, author of Ouija: The Most Dangerous Game, before his death Merrill warned {{against the use of}} the Ouija board.|$|E
25|$|I always <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> no one {{understood}} me anyway, that no {{one knew}} who I was and what made me do this or that. And you know, when no one understands you, no one can call you to account. Not even the court could call me to account. But the dead can. They understand. They don't even have to have been there, but if they do, they understand even better. Here in prison they were with me a lot. They came every night, whether I wanted them to or not. Before the trial I could still chase them away when they wanted to come.|$|E

I've <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> a selfish player when he becomes captain [...] [...] [...] gets a little less out of his players than someone who is not selfish.|$|E
2500|$|When I {{hear what}} we call music, {{it seems to me}} that someone is talking. And talking about his feelings, or about his ideas of relationships. But when I hear traffic, the sound of traffic—here on Sixth Avenue, for instance—I don't <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> anyone is talking. I <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> sound is acting. And I love the {{activity}} of sound [...] I don't need sound to talk to me.|$|R

500|$|Josef Zankowicz, {{who managed}} the firm's {{publicity}} during this period, later commented: [...] "We <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> {{we might get}} sued—actually, we prayed to get sued. Because by suing us, the number one player in the marketplace opened up the door. Anyone can create an interesting product, spend $10 million and create awareness of it. But it's another thing to create a product and spend one-tenth that amount and create twice as much awareness." ...|$|E
500|$|After From Russia with Love, Eon had {{considered}} undertaking {{an adaptation of}} either On Her Majesty's Secret Service or Casino Royale. They entered into negotiations with Charles K. Feldman, who held {{the rights to the}} latter, but a deal proved too difficult to achieve. Instead, Eon turned to the Thunderball novel. Although Eon had wanted to adapt the book in 1962, it had not been possible until the legal obstacles had been cleared. As a result of the settlement of the copyright infringement lawsuit brought by Kevin McClory, Eon negotiated with McClory to make Thunderball. McClory received the sole producer credit on the film, while Broccoli and Saltzman took the title Executive Producer, although [...] "in reality all three men would essentially act as producers". Broccoli later said of the three-way partnership that [...] "We didn't want anyone else to make Thunderball... We <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> if anyone else came in and made their own Bond film, it would have been bad for our series".|$|E
500|$|In August 2008, The Straits Times {{said that}} Thumboo's [...] "most {{powerful}} legacy" [...] was [...] "spearheading {{the creation of}} a Singapore literature in English", although Thumboo himself downplayed his pioneering role by commenting: [...] "There were not that many people writing in 1965, so you <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> you had to create something. But you don't stand there and say, 'Look, I am a pioneer'. There is a need to do something, to help go about creating something, and you do it." [...] He compiled and edited some of the first anthologies of English poetry from Singapore and Malaysia, including The Flowering Tree (1970), Seven Poets (1973) and The Second Tongue (1979). He was also the general editor of two multilingual anthologies sponsored by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Committee of Culture and Information entitled The Poetry of Singapore (1985) and The Fiction of Singapore (1990). In addition to the collections of poetry already mentioned, he has published two volumes of poetry for children called Child's Delight (1972), and another collection called Friend: Poems (2003). Still Travelling, an anthology consisting of almost 50 poems, was published in 2008.|$|E
2500|$|Déjà vu ( [...] ; [...] ) from French, {{literally}} [...] "already seen", is <b>the</b> {{phenomenon of}} <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> situation currently being experienced {{has already been}} experienced in the past.|$|R

500|$|The filmmakers {{went to the}} Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and U.S. Customs {{early on}} with the script {{and told them that}} they were trying to present as {{detailed}} and accurate a picture of the current drug war as possible. The DEA and Customs pointed out inaccuracies in the script. In addition, they gave the production team access to the border checkpoint to Mexico, as shown in the film during the scene in which Wakefield and his people talk with border officials. Despite the assistance, the DEA did not try to influence the content of the script. Soderbergh said Traffic had influences from the films of Richard Lester and Jean-Luc Godard. He also spent time analyzing The Battle of Algiers and Z, which, according to the director, <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> the footage was [...] "caught" [...] and not staged. Another inspiration was Alan J. Pakula's film All the President's Men because of its ability to tackle serious issues while being entertaining. In the opening credits of his film, Soderbergh tried to replicate the typeface from All the President's Men and the placement on-screen at the bottom left-hand corner. Analyzing this film helped the director deal with the large cast and working in many different locations for Traffic.|$|E
500|$|SFScope {{columnist}} Sarah Stegall also lauded Torv's performance, {{noting that}} the actress [...] "captures Nimoy's staccato delivery, her growling voice, even his trick eyebrow. Not since Zachary Quinto played a young Spock in Star Trek {{a couple of years}} ago have I seen anyone so perfectly sound and move like Nimoy." [...] Stegall did express a wish that the characters not try to explain every case (such as the one in the episode) out of a belief that their explanations were often absurd; this observation led Stegall to praise the new character of Lincoln however, as she believed, like Hanson, that the series has [...] "been needing an Everyman in this mix for awhile, someone for whom immortality is not a commonplace." [...] Charlie Jane Anders of io9 was critical of the episode, remarking that [...] "the whole 'soul magnets' thing, which had seemed to be a throwaway comment a few episodes ago, is turning out to be sort of a weak plot device. And the whole bodily-possession storyline is just perhaps one level of wackiness too far for me. I also <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> this might finally be the acting challenge that was beyond Anna Torv's considerable abilities, as her Leonard Nimoy impression quickly started to grate on my nerves." ...|$|E
2500|$|An early {{admirer of}} The House in Paris was Virginia Woolf, {{a good friend}} of Bowen's. In a letter about the book, Woolf wrote, [...] "I <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> your world imposed itself on my world, while I read, which only happens when one is taken in hand by a work." [...] A.S. Byatt, in her {{introduction}} to the 1976 Penguin edition, stated she had been reading the novel since the age of ten.|$|E

"While it {{is correct}} to {{denounce}} certain laws of Islam or manifestations of its culture as backward, Muslims who constantly <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> {{they should be}} ashamed of their religion will increase their need for cultural self-assertion." ...|$|R

2500|$|In 1988, DeVille {{relocated}} from New York to New Orleans, {{where he}} found a spiritual home. [...] "I was stunned", {{he said in a}} 1993 interview. [...] "I <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> I was going back home. It was very strange... I live in the French Quarter, two streets away from Bourbon Street; at night, when I go to bed, I hear the boogie that comes from the streets, and in the morning, when I wake up, I hear the blues." ...|$|E
2500|$|Al Jazeera's long-time Berlin {{correspondent}} Aktham Suliman left in late 2012 [...] "It wasn't {{just because}} the broadcaster seemed less interested in reports from Europe. Rather, Suliman <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> {{he was no longer}} being allowed to work as an independent journalist. [...] "Before the beginning of the Arab Spring, we were a voice for change," [...] he says, [...] "a platform for critics and political activists throughout the region. Now, Al-Jazeera has become a propaganda broadcaster." [...] "Al-Jazeera takes a clear position in every country from which it reports -- not based on journalistic priorities, but rather on the interests of the Foreign Ministry of Qatar," [...] he says. [...] "In order to maintain my integrity as a reporter, I had to quit."" ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the age of}} 15, Eggleston {{was sent}} to the Webb School, a {{boarding}} establishment. Eggleston later recalled few fond memories of the school, telling a reporter, [...] "It had a kind of Spartan routine to 'build character'. I never knew what that was supposed to mean. It was so callous and dumb. It was {{the kind of place where}} it was considered effeminate to like music and painting." [...] Eggleston was unusual among his peers in eschewing the traditional Southern male pursuits of hunting and sports, in favor of artistic pursuits and observation of the world. Nevertheless, Eggleston noted that he never felt like an outsider. [...] "I never <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> I didn't fit in," [...] he told a reporter, [...] "But probably I didn't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Julia," [...] he declared, [...] "I am {{suffering}} {{just as much}} as you. I <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> I <b>have</b> {{descended to}} <b>the</b> level of a common brawler. Yet what was I to do? he needed the lesson very badly indeed." ...|$|R

2500|$|Joey Ramone stated [...] "I {{spent most}} of the early 70s {{listening}} to Slade Alive! thinking to myself, [...] "Wow – this is what I want to do. I want to make that kind of intensity for myself. A couple of years later I was at CBGB's doing my best Noddy Holder." [...] Steve Jones of Sex Pistols stated [...] "Slade never compromised. We always <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> they were on our side. I don't know but I think we were right." [...] NME commented on Slade's legacy in a review of a greatest hits album, [...] "They embodied the glorious absurdity of the greatest pop, in the sideburns, the mirrored top hat and Dave Hill's pudding bowl haircut. As such they were the simplest, most effective possible, riposte to prog rock's bloated pretensions and pseudo-intellect." [...] In 1981, Adam and the Ants' lead guitarist and co-songwriter Marco Pirroni stated that he was greatly influenced by the first gig he ever attended which was Slade at Wembley Pool in 1973.|$|E
2500|$|The {{album is}} {{composed}} of nine songs composed by Sheena, as well as three songs composed by pianist H Zetto M, [...] "Gunjō Biyori", [...] "Genjitsu ni Oite" [...] and [...] "Service". The album features 10 songs sung in Japanese, plus [...] "Genjitsu ni Oite", an instrumental, and [...] "Genjitsu ni Warau", a song sung in English. For her first three solo albums, Sheena worked as the sole songwriter {{on all of the}} songs. Sheena stated that it had been [...] "a dream of sorts" [...] to release music that collaborated with different songwriters, and she wanted Tokyo Jihen to be different from her solo project, in which her opinion was final on all matters. Later Tokyo Jihen albums featured much more song-writing from other members, most notably Variety (2007), however Sheena still <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> it was [...] "taboo" [...] for other people to write songs for her during Kyōiku. All 17 of the songs for the Kyōiku era were recorded over a period of four days.|$|E
2500|$|The 'holy trinity' of Best, Law and Charlton {{remained}} {{effective as}} {{ever in the}} 1968–69 campaign. However the club's new recruits were not up to scratch, as United dropped to 11th in the league before Busby announced his retirement. Best later said that [...] "I increasingly <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> I was carrying the team at times on the pitch." [...] He scored 22 goals in 55 games, though only he and Denis Law scored more than six league goals. In the Intercontinental Cup, fans and players alike looked forward to seeing United take on Argentine opposition Estudiantes de La Plata {{over the course of}} two legs. However Best said [...] "no one tackled harder or dirtier than this Argentinian team" [...] as a 1–0 defeat at the Estadio Camilo Cichero was followed by a 1–1 draw at Old Trafford. In the home tie, Best was kicked and spat on by José Hugo Medina, and both players were sent off after Best reacted with a punch. Despite their poor league form, United managed to reach the semi-finals of the European Cup (they had a relatively easy run in getting past the Republic of Ireland's Waterford United, Belgium's Anderlecht, and Austria's Rapid Wien) where they were knocked out 2–1 on aggregate by A.C. Milan following a 2–0 defeat at the San Siro; Milan goalkeeper Fabio Cudicini was the hero after keeping United to only one goal at Old Trafford.|$|E
