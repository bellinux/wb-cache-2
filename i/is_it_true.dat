2500|$|Albo {{rejects the}} {{assumption}} that creation ex nihilo is essential in belief in God. [...] Albo freely criticizes Maimonides' thirteen principles of belief and Crescas' six principles. [...] According to Albo, [...] "belief in the Messiah is only a 'twig' unnecessary to the soundness of the trunk"; not essential to Judaism. [...] Nor <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>true,</b> according to Albo, that every law is binding. [...] Though every ordinance has the power of conferring happiness in its observance, {{it is not true}} that every law must be observed, or that through the neglect of a part of the law, a Jew would violate the divine covenant or be damned. [...] Contemporary Orthodox Jews, however, vehemently disagree with Albo's position believing that all Jews are divinely obligated to fulfill every applicable commandment.|$|E
2500|$|During {{his early}} life, Emerson seems {{to develop a}} {{hierarchy}} of races based on faculty to reason or rather, whether African slaves were distinguishably equal to white men based {{on their ability to}} reason. In a journal entry written in 1822, Emerson wrote about a personal observation: [...] "It can hardly be true that the difference lies in the attribute of reason. I saw ten, twenty, a hundred large lipped, lowbrowed black men in the streets who, except in the mere matter of language, did not exceed the sagacity of the elephant. Now <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>true</b> that these were created superior to this wise animal, and designed to control it? And in comparison with the highest orders of men, the Africans will stand so low as to make the difference which subsists between themselves & the sagacious beasts inconsiderable." ...|$|E

2500|$|In February 1924, the Los Angeles Times {{reported}} {{that the number of}} feature films produced from the original stories or adaptations of Mr. Sullivan totaled 311 in eight years. [...] The Times noted: [...] "This record undoubtedly is unrivaled among screen authors. [...] Mr. Sullivan's work is all the more remarkable because of the recognition which it has achieved for unvarying quality and variety." [...] At that time, Sullivan described the rule he applied in the selection of a story for the screen:"Is it human, <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>true</b> to life, is it sincere? If you can conscientiously satisfy yourself on these things, you won't have to worry as to whether the public will like the story or not. [...] If you are genuinely moved by it, you may be sure that the public will respond in like manner. ... Give the public a story that touches the heart and is true to life, and, to paraphrase Emerson, 'the world will make a beaten path to the theater box office.'" ...|$|E
