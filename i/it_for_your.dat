[...] "Mama" [...] was released in the UK and Ireland as a double A-side along with [...] "Who Do You Think You Are" [...] in March 1997, timed not only for the Comic Relief telethon, but also for Mothering Sunday.|$|E
500|$|According to Maxwell's papers, {{when news}} of the {{destruction}} of the sandstone slab reached Bengal, James Prinsep asked the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Colonel William John Butterworth, to secure any legible fragments that might still exist and to send them to the Royal Asiatic Society's museum. Butterworth replied: [...] "The only remaining portion of the stone you mention, except what Colonel Low may have, I have found lying in the verandah of the Treasury at Singapore, where it was used as a seat by the Sepoys of the guard and persons in waiting to transact business. I lost no time in sending it to my house, but, alas! not before the inscription was nearly erased. Such as the fragment was then however – i.e., in 1843 – it is now; for I have preserved the stone with much care, and shall have much pleasure in sending <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> museum, having failed to establish one, as I hoped to have done, in Singapore." ...|$|E

500|$|New {{releases}} {{continued into}} late 2006. The [...] "Thieves' Den", a 2.27MB download offering {{the chance to}} [...] "Uncover a famous pirate's lost ship and claim <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> own", was released on May 22 for the Xbox 360, priced at 150 Marketplace points, [...] "roughly" [...] equivalent to US$1.89. Explaining the add-on, Ashley Cheng stated [...] "Basically, it's Goonies." [...] "Mehrunes' Razor", a quest revolving around a mage {{in search of the}} deadly Daedric artifact known as Mehrunes' Razor, was released on June 14. It became the most expensive download yet, at US$2.99 for PC users and 250 Marketplace points, equivalent to US$3.13, for Xbox 360 owners. One 1UP.com reporter took the occasion to reflect on the increasing price of owning the [...] "complete" [...] Oblivion. With all the add-ons included, he calculated, [...] "That's over $80 in game for the complete version of Oblivion, thus far." [...] Foreseeing eventual problems with the upcoming PS3 release, and a potential bundling of all the software for a cheaper price, he wondered: [...] "will Xbox 360 and PC users feel slighted?...Microtransactions are sticky business." [...] Joystiq continued to comment on the [...] "Horse Armor" [...] add-on in their notice of the quest's release. [...] "With a weapon like that, who needs horse armor?" [...] On July 13, [...] "The Vile Lair", sporting a hidden crypt called [...] "Deepscorn Hollow" [...] for players bitten with Oblivions vampirism bug, was released. Like the [...] "Orrery" [...] and the [...] "Wizard's Tower", Bethesda set [...] "The Vile Lair"'s PC release price at US$1.89, and the Xbox 360 release price at 150 Marketplace points, equivalent to US$1.88. Joystiq responded positively to the new price point. [...] "What a bargain!...It's good to see the folks at Oblivion have learned their lesson and aren't offering relatively super expensive content not fit to see the light of day." ...|$|E

2500|$|Annabella did {{not have}} a close {{relationship}} with the young Ada and often left her in the care of her own mother Judith, Hon. Lady Milbanke who doted on her grandchild. However, because of societal attitudes of the time—which favoured the husband in any separation, with the welfare of any child acting as mitigation—Annabella had to present herself as a loving mother to the rest of society. This included writing anxious letters to Lady Milbanke about Ada's welfare, with a cover note saying to retain the letters in case she had to use them to show maternal concern. In one letter to Lady Milbanke, she referred to Ada as [...] "it": [...] "I talk to <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> satisfaction, not my own, and shall be very glad when you have it under your own." [...] In her teenage years, several of her mother's close friends watched Ada for any sign of moral deviation. Ada dubbed these observers the [...] "Furies" [...] and later complained they exaggerated and invented stories about her.|$|E
2500|$|According to Thomas Merton, Saint Lutgarde (d.1246), a Cistercian mystic of Aywieres, Belgium, {{was one of}} {{the great}} {{precursors}} of the devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. A contemporary of St. Francis, she [...] "... entered upon the mystical life with a vision of the pierced Heart of the Saviour, and had concluded her mystical espousals with the Incarnate Word by an exchange of hearts with Him." [...] Sources say that Christ came in a visitation to Lutgarde, offering her whatever gift of grace she should desire; she asked for a better grasp of Latin, that she might better understand the word of God and sing God's praise. Christ granted her request and Lutgarde’s mind was flooded with the riches of psalms, antiphons, readings, and responsories. However, a painful emptiness persisted. She returned to Christ, asking to return his gift, and wondering if she might, just possibly, exchange it for another. “And for what would you exchange it?” Christ asked. “Lord, said Lutgarde, I would exchange <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>your</b> Heart.” Christ then reached into Lutgarde and, removing her heart, replaced it with his own, at the same time hiding her heart within his breast.|$|E
