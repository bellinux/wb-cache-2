Improving distribution centre efficiency {{of just a}} few percentage points through advanced automation and real-time replenishment may deliver significant savings and require less capital to be tied up in inventory. 1 An interesting class of production/inventory control problems is the one that considers the single-location, single-product case under non-stationary stochastic demand, fixed production/ordering cost and per-unit holding cost. Exact and efficient approaches for computing optimal production/replenishment decisions are a key factor for achieving profitability in retail business. One of the possible policies that can be adopted to manage stocks is the replenishment cycle policy [6].

40|$|This paper studies a two-echelon {{supply chain}} with {{stochastic}} and discrete consumer demand, batch order quantities, periodic <b>inventory</b> <b>review,</b> and deterministic transportation times. Reorder point policies manage inventories at every location. Average inventory, backorders and fill rates are evaluated exactly for each location. Safety stock is evaluated exactly {{at the lower}} echelon and a good approximation is detailed for the upper echelon. Numerical data are presented to demonstrate the model’s utility. It is found that system costs generally increase substantially if the upper echelon is restricted to carry no inventory, of if the upper echelon is required to provide a high fill rate. In many cases it is optimal to set the upper echelon’s reorder point to yield near zero safety stock, yet in some cases this simple heuristic can significantly increase supply chain operating costs. Finally, policies selected under the assumption of continuous <b>inventory</b> <b>review</b> can perform poorly if implemented in an environment with periodic review. This paper studies a distribution system with one central warehouse and N identical retailers. Inventory is reviewed periodically and transportation times are deterministic.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the challenges of}} improving the on-time delivery performance of a high-volume critical part type in a high-product-mix manufacturing facility of valves. Preliminary analysis on the push-type production system of the valve manufacturing cell shows that long production lead time caused by excessive inventory queuing and accumulation as well as lack of standardized finished goods inventory management policy are the major factors that limit the on-time delivery performance. A new pull-type production system is developed with {{the design of a}} highly responsive fabrication line which enables faster material movement and an efficient <b>inventory</b> <b>review</b> framework for real-time monitoring of inventory positions. A dedicated production line with the placement of effectively controlled Work-In-Process (WIP) buffers is constructed, which is capable of reducing the production lead time by more than 80 %, along with a 40 % reduction in overall WIP volume. Moreover, a finished goods <b>inventory</b> <b>review</b> policy is proposed based on the (s, S) policy which significantly eliminates the possibilities of backlog and inventory explosion by the setup of both lower and upper control limits on inventory positions. The suggested policy is expected to ensure a service level of at least 95 % during peak demand period, with up to 50 % potential reduction in average inventory level held by the system. A Kanban system is also established to coordinate operations in the proposed pull-type production system. by Bingxin Yao. Thesis: M.

Supply disruptions have various forms, including machine breakdowns and natural disasters. As an effective marketing tool, dynamic pricing has been helping sellers enhance their profits. In addition, price-dependent demand is common in practice. This paper studies a single-product inventory system that consists of a supplier, a retailer, and customers. The supplier is subject to disruptions. The retailer adopts a periodic review inventory policy, under which an appropriate inventory replenishment order is sent to the supplier every a fixed period of time. Price is adjusted according to inventory level at each <b>inventory</b> <b>review</b> point. Customer demand variation based on price is also considered. In this paper, we simulate the concerned inventory system and investigate the impacts of supply disruptions, dynamic pricing, and price-sensitive demand on the retailer’s annual profit. ...|$|E

The inventory {{replenishment lead time}} is a multiple of the <b>inventory</b> <b>review</b> cycle. Customers are classified into two groups: short lead-time customers requiring the product immediately and long lead-time customers who allow the supplier the flexibility to deliver immediately or in the next cycle. We consider an inventory-commitment problem, in which the supplier allocates its on-hand inventory to these two groups of customers. When inventory runs out, the supplier backlog orders to future cycles. Therefore, the supplier faces two problems: how the onhand inventories are allocated between two classes of customers and how the backlogged orders are cleared when replenishments arrive? We consider the former as an inventory-commitment problem, and resolve the latter with priority rules. We formulate the inventory commitment decision as a dynamic programming problem, and study three priority rules in clearing backlogs.

40|$|Supply Chain Management (SCM) {{has become}} a popular topic in recent years. One of the main {{discussion}} points is the effective management of inventories along the supply chain. Several inventory policies have been analyzed and compared to overcome the traditional tradeoff between high service levels and high inventory costs and vice versa. This paper describes how different demand data aggregation affects reorder point calculations in continuous <b>inventory</b> <b>review</b> systems and analyzes the impact on inventories, safety stocks, and service levels of the supply chain members. Based on a linear three-stage supply chain, four different forecasting scenarios based on simple means and variance calculations as well as moving average and moving variance estimations have been tested. To analyze potential effects for different supply chain settings, four demand patterns were implemented (stationary, season, trend, trend and season). The simulations reveal different effects depending on demand data aggregation and customer demand structure. Since the assumption of normally distributed demand data is violated for upstream suppliers in linear supply chains, difficulties arise particularly in calculating safety stocks. Aggregating order data can mitigate some of the biases in several cases. It is shown that forecasting monthly aggregated orders outperforms the other strategies in terms of lower mean inventories and safety stocks, but may lead to slightly lower service levels. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the issue of}} cutting emissions by reducing shipment frequency {{within the framework of}} periodic <b>inventory</b> <b>review</b> system, {{which is one of the}} most popular inventory control systems in practice. We first formulate a benchmark model to represent the Business-As-Usual scenario then further develop this model into a carbon emission reduction model by adding a constraint that represents the emission reduction percentage target. Because of the non-convexity of general models, we simplify our two general models into special cases and develop their propositions analytically. We then conduct comprehensive numerical experiments on the general models. Our findings suggest that by reducing shipment frequency and adjusting inventory control decisions in a periodic review system, a firm could meet a moderate emission reduction target with limited impact on total cost. Our results also show that cost associated with emission reduction is related to unit backorder cost and leadtime, while the common belief that a higher unit holding cost would lead to higher cost for emission reduction is not supported. To the best of our knowledge, no prior research has yet addressed carbon reduction considerations within the framework of periodic review inventory systems. This study provides insights in understanding in what ways the adjustment of inventory control decisions could lead to reducing carbon emissions in logistics.

40|$|This paper studies a periodic-review, serial {{inventory}} {{system in}} which echelon (r,nQ,T) policies are implemented. Under such a policy, each stage reviews its inventory in every T period and orders according to an echelon (r,nQ,T) policy. Two types of fixed costs are considered: one is associated with each order batch Q, {{and the other is}} incurred for each <b>inventory</b> <b>review.</b> The objective is to find the policy parameters such that the average total cost per period is minimized. This paper provides a method for obtaining heuristic and optimal policy parameters. The heuristic is based on minimizing lower and upper bounds on the total cost function. These total cost bounds, which are separable functions of the policy parameters, are obtained in two steps: First, we decompose the total cost into costs associated with each stage, which include a penalty cost for holding inadequate stock. Second, we construct lower and upper bounds for the penalty cost by regulating downstream policy parameters. To find the optimal solution, we further construct cost bounds for each echelon (a subsystem that includes a stage and all of its downstream stages) by regulating holding and backorder cost parameters. The echelon lower-bound cost functions, as well as the stage cost bounds, generate bounds for the optimal solution. In a numerical study, we find that the heuristic is near optimal when the ratio of the fixed cost to the holding cost at the most downstream stage is large. We also find that changing the optimal batch sizes may not affect the optimal reorder intervals or, equivalently, the delivery schedules under some conditions. © 2010 INFORMS...|$|E
