40|$|The U. S. airline {{industry}} is facing delays due to congestion {{problems in the}} air transportation network. These delays not only lead to increased costs, {{but they also have}} safety related implications. Some of the costs related to such delays could be minimized by <b>holding</b> <b>aircraft</b> on the ground at the originating airport when congestion-related delays are expected en route or at the destination airport. Aside from reducing operating costs, the ground holding policy (GHP) also has beneficial implications on some safety concerns, since it is generally felt that it is better to hold an aircraft on the ground than in the air. The GHP is formulated as an integer programming problem and solved using heuristic techniques. However, the presence of discrete and binary integer variables increases the complexity involved when solved using traditional algorithms. Genetic algorithms (GAs) offer a powerful alternative for efficiently solving such problems. A GA is a search and optimization technique based on natural genetics and selection. This paper presents a discussion of GAs and their applicability to evaluating the GHP. Specific examples are presented to illustrate such applications.

40|$|Under current National Airspace System {{operations}} conflict alerts {{for aircraft}} in holding patterns are often missed or in error {{due to the}} fact that trajectories for <b>holding</b> <b>aircraft</b> are not modeled in existing Conflict Alert or Conflict Probe automation. In addition, a controller in one sector may not know when aircraft are holding in a neighboring sector. These factors can lead to an increased potential for loss of separation while aircraft are flying in holding patterns. The objective of this work is to develop a holding function that automatically determines when an aircraft enters a holding pattern, computes a holding region around the pattern, and probes the holding region for conflict with other traffic. Since controller workload is generally high during periods when aircraft are in holding the operational concept of use assumes the holding region is automatically computed and the controller is alerted only if another aircraft is predicted to fly through the holding region. The holding algorithm is applied only to aircraft that would likely go into holding during rush periods, e. g., arrivals to capacity constrained airports. A holding region is computed for aircraft that settle out on a steady outbound course. Initial estimates of the holding fix position, turn radius, and holding pattern leg length are computed and automatically updated as the aircraft flies the pattern.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the first local search heuristic for the coupled runway sequencing (arrival & departure) and taxiway routing problems, {{based on the}} receding horizon (RH) scheme {{that takes into account}} the dynamic nature of the problem. As test case, we use Manchester Airport, the third busiest airport in the UK. From the ground movement perspective, the airport layout requires that departing aircraft taxi across the arrivals runway. This makes it impossible to separate arrival from departure sequencing in practice. Operationally, interactions between aircraft on the taxiways could prevent aircraft from taking off from, or landing on, runways during the slots assigned to them by an algorithm optimizing runway use alone. We thus consider the interactions between arrival and departure aircraft on the airport surface. Compared to sequentially optimized solutions, the results obtained with our approach indicate a significant decrease in the taxiway routing delay, with generally no loss in performance in terms of the sequencing delay for a regular day of operations. Another benefit of such a simultaneous optimization approach is the possibility of <b>holding</b> <b>aircraft</b> at the stands for longer, without the engines running. This significantly reduces the fuel burn, as well as bottlenecks and traffic congestion during peak hours that are often the cause of flight delays due to the limited amount of airport surface space available. Given that the maximum computing time per horizon is around 95 seconds, real-time operation might be practical with increased computing power...|$|E

40|$|Air {{traffic is}} {{expected}} to continue to grow in the future and improved methods for dealing with the increased demand on the system need to be designed and implemented. One method for reducing surface congestion at airports is surface congestion management (SCM) (also commonly called departure queue management or departure metering). The concept generally involves <b>holding</b> <b>aircraft</b> at the gate or in the ramp area instead of releasing them onto the active movement area during periods of high departure demand. The FAA is planning to implement surface congestion management at airports where the cost/benefit analysis is favorable. Therefore, an estimate of the benefits of implementing surface congestion management in the future is necessary. To overcome the uncertainties and difficulties inherent in forecasting, this thesis adopts a multi-fidelity modeling approach and proposes three methods for estimating the benefits of SCM where the higher fidelity models study a subset of airports to inform and validate the lower fidelity models used on the entire set of airports. In the first model, a detailed analysis of a field trial of SCM at JFK airport is conducted using operational data. The second model estimates the benefits of implementing SCM at 8 major US airports from 2010 to 2030 by simulating congestion and performance levels through taxi time estimation. The last model explores several options for generalizing the results to 35 airports in the US. The results are also validated against historical benefits estimates as well as field trials of SCM where available. The findings show that SCM will result in fuel savings on the order of 1 % of the total fuel burn in all stages of flight and between 5 % and 45 % of taxi-out fuel burn, depending on the airport. by Alex Nakahara.

40|$|Implementations {{of surface}} traffic {{management}} strategies at congested airports {{have the potential}} to yield significant benefits, but must account for the constraints and objectives of multiple stakeholders. This thesis considers the implementation of pushback control policies at LaGuardia Airport in New York. This class of control policies regulate departure pushback rates by <b>holding</b> <b>aircraft</b> at their gates during congested periods, in a manner that maintains the departure throughput of the airport while reducing the taxi-out time. Such a time reduction leads to reductions in fuel burn and emissions. The main contribution of this thesis is the consideration of gate-holding limits at the gate which aim at including operational benefit-cost analysis in addition to the pushback control. The main consequence of those gate holds are gate conflicts and take-off order swaps, which are analyzed in detail throughout this thesis. The results show that taxi-out savings are a nonlinear and increasing function of gate-holding limit, and thus, more benefits are expected from longer gate conflict limits. However, the non-linear component creates opportunities for additional benefits with marginal cost increases. On the cost side, gate-holding times are the biggest component, but are commensurate with the benefits. One held minute translates to one saved minute in taxi-out; this finding holds true regardless of the gate-holding limit. Departure order swaps and gate conflicts increase as stricter limits are imposed on the gate-holding times, but not significantly. The benefits and costs are shown to be approximately equivalent to the share of the airlines departures at LaGuardia, demonstrating a fair allocation strategy. by Hector Fornes Martinez. Thesis: S.

40|$|Introduction: Air Traffic Control {{operations}} are described {{extensively in the}} ATC manuals such as the Airman's Information Manual [1] and the ATC Controller's Handbook [2]. Mathematical analysis has also been conducted for the ATC operations as evident in the many theses that {{have been published in}} ATC research [3, 4, 5]. A brief description is due here however in order to provide a background for the following document. There are six major ATC functions in the terminal area and a summary of their description in Sadoune's thesis [5] follows: Flow Management: The flow management purpose is to provide efficient transition between the en-route corridors and the terminal area through the metering fixes. The en-route corridors are the airways connecting the airports, the terminal area is the designated space around the airport, and the metering fixes are the points at which aircraft enter the terminal area under the flow control process called metering. The flow management system is capable of delivering the aircraft to the metering fix at predetermined time, altitude, and speed, minimizing fuel consumption and flight time. Beyond the metering fix however the concern in no longer fuel and cost, it is the separation between the aircraft and the landing schedule. Ground-based flight path generation is needed at that point. Runway Scheduling: The runway capacity is the limiting factor of the flow of traffic at congested airports. There are many reasons why runways are not used efficiently in the current tactical practice. These include the independent scheduling of landings and takeoffs, the ad hoc fashion in which takeoffs are inserted between landings, and the common use of the first-come-first-serve approach which is fair but not optimal. Runway scheduling is a queuing process and can be optimized for maximum throughput, long term service, and minimum delays of aircraft, taking into account fuel consumption, duration of flight, and other factors. The difficulty is in the dynamic nature of the schedule where modifications are needed as new entrants arrive or as environmental conditions change. The determination of the runway capacity and its improvement through the use of advanced technologies are discussed in Flow Control: Through traffic redistribution the flow control process helps smooth the demand fluctuations leading to a controlled number of aircraft simultaneously present in the terminal area. Two processes accomplish flow control: metering and holding. Metering divides the approach to the airport into successive stages between metering fixes. The flow management system delivers the aircraft to the metering fixes at the predetermined time, altitude, and speed. Holding points are assigned where <b>holding</b> <b>aircraft</b> are stacked and isolated from traffic. <b>Holding</b> <b>aircraft</b> circle in holding patterns awaiting landing clearance. Therefore, while metering moves the delays resulting from the runway capacity upstream, holding extends the flight path in time to accommodate arrival delays. These practices however can result in idle runway time in favor of more flow control leading to less efficient use of the runway. Flight Path Generation: There are standard routes both from the terminal area entry points to the runway for approach and from the runway to the en-route corridors for departure. These predefined routes can be used at low traffic flow rates, and add to the precision since automatic flight control systems are capable of flying along them automatically. However they are not optimal in using the space, or in exploiting the aircraft capabilities, or in maximizing the runway capacity. Automated flight path generation allows the incorporation of the space organization, the ATC separation criteria, the landing and takeoff schedule, the aircraft dynamics and performance limitations, and the maneuvering characteristics of the pilot in generating more optimal and flexible paths. This subject will be emphasized further in this document. Path Conformance Monitoring: In order to supervise the execution of the flight path plan, the radar surveillance system provides vague and non-precise measurement of the position of the aircraft. The controllers base their estimates of the conformance on 2 -dimensional radar displays, and have to wait few intervals to estimate the direction of the aircraft. To adjust for the path conformance error the controllers issue heading, altitude, and speed clearances (vectors) to the pilots. Communication between controllers and pilots is done via radio transmission. Errors result from misunderstanding between the pilot and the controller, pilot response, as well as wind and unexpected atmospheric disturbances. Again new technologies and more automation are expected to improve the path conformance capabilities. These include better surveillance using satellites, digital data links for communication between the controller and the pilot, and display of the path to the pilot on board the aircraft. Questions of resolution and threshold of the conformance error become critical to the automation of the monitoring function. Hazard Monitoring: This includes detecting possible collisions between aircraft and with the ground. There is a trade off between false alarms and missed alarms in setting the threshold for the hazard alarm. Namely the more conservative the alarm threshold is set, the less is the risk of collision due to a missed alarm. But the disturbance to the traffic flow caused by the large number of false alarms is higher.

40|$|Annual U. S. {{air travel}} demand {{has been growing}} {{steadily}} by 4 - 5 % over the last decade, and {{it is estimated that}} the demand will nearly double in the next twenty years. It has also been estimated by the International Civil Aviation Organization that global demand for commercial aircraft will increase at an average annual rate of 4. 1 % by 2034 (IATA, 2014). However, airport expansions and aviation infrastructure upgrades have not kept pace with the increase in air traffic demand, as only 3 % of all the new airport projects around the world are planned in the U. S. (CAPA, 2015). Thus, the operation rates at existing airports are likely to increase significantly, implying a greater need to increase the utilization of currently available runway capacity. With steadily increasing demand in air traffic and limited airport capacity, delay in air traffic is ubiquitous. Approximately 25 % of flights experience delays of at least 15 minutes each year, resulting in significant passenger service issues and costs to airlines and society in general. Delays constitute the top service complaint for airlines, which has implications for the society as a whole - both economically and environmentally. Flight delays also increase airline costs directly, due to associated additional fuel, crew and maintenance costs. Recent studies show that the estimated cost of air transportation delay to the American economy ranges from $ 32. 9 billion to $ 41 billion a year, of which, $ 8 billion are direct costs to airlines (Ball et al., 2010; Ferguson et al., 2013). Noting that more than 60 % of delay is due to airport operations (Balakrishna et al., 2010), this thesis aims at helping reduce delay through better management of arrival and departure operations at airports, which can create relevant and significant value for the airlines and for the society. Arrival and departure operations inherently involve significant uncertainty. When an aircraft is approaching the runway, many factors affect its trajectory, such as weather, wind conditions, pilot behavior, aircraft weight, as well as the differences in types of aircraft and flight management systems. When an aircraft arrives at the gate, operating conditions, such as unplanned security checks, varied durations of deplaning and boarding, as well as the maintenance and fueling involved, could contribute to variations of actual departure time for the next flight. All of these stochastic factors involve uncertainty {{and they need to be}} taken into account while making operational decisions. On the other hand, stochastic treatment of such operational problems has not been common in the literature due to difficulties associated with the characterization of uncertainty and the computational tractability. I argue in this thesis that, with recent advances in computing power and data analysis tools, such stochastic treatments are more amenable for practical use. To this end, I study four novel operational problems related to flight arrivals and departures at airports under the uncertainty of operating conditions, and demonstrate the potential value that can be generated through stochastic models within the context of airline and airport operations. The problems I study involve both strategic and tactical decisions for airline service improvement and cost reduction. The first two problems consider managing arrival operations at airports, while the last two problems focus on departure operations. In the first and second problems, I focus on arrival operations in the context of optimized profile descent (OPD), which is a novel arrival procedure for the Next Generation Air Transportation System. In the first problem, I identify policies for managing arrival operations at the tactical level by developing a stochastic dynamic programming framework to manage the sequencing and separation of flights. I find that simple calculation based measures can be used as optimal decision rules during such operations, and that the expected annual savings can be around $ 29 million if such implementations are adapted by major airports in the U. S. Of these savings, $ 24 million are direct savings for airlines due to reduced fuel usage, corresponding to a potential savings of 10 - 15 % in fuel consumption over current practice. I also find that optimal spacing of OPD flights is much more important than optimal sequencing of these flights. Furthermore, there is not much difference between the environmental costs of fuel-optimal and sustainably-optimal spacing policies. Hence, an airline-centric approach in improving OPD operations is likely to be not in conflict with objectives that might be prioritized by other stakeholders. In the second problem, I study the optimal design of arrival traffic management systems at airports at the strategic level. I claim that implementation of OPD operations requires effective metering configurations at airports due to the increased role of uncertainty in aircraft trajectories during descent. I develop stochastic models to further increase the value of OPD operations over conventional arrival procedures by optimizing metering point configurations, which include identification of the optimal number and locations of metering points to use. I provide numerical results based on actual traffic information at major U. S. airports, which indicate that the total potential savings in the top ten major airports could be up to $ 22 million per year if the proposed policies are implemented. I also find that the optimal metering configurations are mostly robust under different operating conditions. In addition, my results suggest that early spacing adjustments near the top of descent (TOD) are of more value for larger volumes of air traffic. In the third and fourth problems, I study optimal departure operations at airports under the context of departure metering, which is an airport surface management procedure that limits the number of aircraft on the runway by <b>holding</b> <b>aircraft</b> at a predesigned metering area. More specifically, in the third problem, I develop a stochastic dynamic programming framework for tactical management of pushback operations at gates and for determining the optimal number of aircraft to be directed to the runway from the metering areas. I introduce four easy-to-implement practical departure metering policies and implement a comparative analysis between these practical policies and the optimal numerical solutions. I also implement sensitivity analysis of the departure metering policies over state variable values. In the fourth problem, I study the optimal metering area capacity at the strategic level. Building on the dynamic programming framework mentioned in the third problem, I identify the optimal metering area capacity using marginal analysis to minimize expected overall costs. Numerical simulations are implemented and potential savings are identified for sample U. S. airports based on varying capacity levels. The optimal metering area capacity is then determined based on the numerical implementations to further improve overall efficiency and sustainability of departure operations. I also analyze the benefits to airlines in terms of annual savings due to such policies, and find that the annual savings could be $ 31 million if the optimal departure metering policies are implemented at the top ten major airports in the U. S. Overall, as one of the few studies on stochasticity in arrival and departure operations, I derive both tactical and strategic policies to improve efficiency and sustainability for airlines and the society, which can enhance service quality and strengthen market position for the airlines involved...|$|E
