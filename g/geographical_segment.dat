40|$|The {{process of}} {{integration}} of foreign students during their {{education at the}} present stage, in Latvia occurs extremely slowly.   It is determined, first of all, {{by the lack of}} scientifically proven study of the given problem. The solution of this problem is possible by the concentration in the single scheme of the theoretical aspects of marketing – management, logical constructs of the estimation criterion, allowing developing the marketing conceptions and finding an opportunity of its implementation through the creation of an organization that offers a product that meets the needs and demands of the consumer – the foreign student. The potential market and target consumer – the foreign students who studying in the universities located in the same <b>geographical</b> <b>segment,</b> defined as the result of marketing research and conducted polling has allowed defining the product and necessity of founding an organization, offering this product. For this purpose is developed the commodity portfolio based on the balance of its structure carried out the forecasting of the strategic planning and is determined its consumption value. The analysis of the competitive environment has allowed identifying the competitors in the <b>geographical</b> <b>segment</b> and a new method of the estimation of the competitiveness, to suggest the new type of competitive strategy, the strategy of the management for an organization. Having determined the necessity of creation of an organization is given the assessment of the possibility of the creation of an organization, offering a product that meets the needs, requirements of the consumer – the foreign student that proves the solution of the problem of the integration process through the exchange as the key category of marketing.

Segmental {{reporting}} (breaking down {{information in}} financial statements between different business activities and different geographical areas) is mandatory for certain companies in South Africa {{in terms of}} the disclosure requirements of AC 115. Such requirements are similar to those contained in other international accounting statements and include the disclosure of turnover, total assets, and operating profit for each industry and <b>geographical</b> <b>segment</b> within which a company operates. The users of financial statements need segmental information to assess the risk, profitability and return of a company, especially when various components of the company differ significantly in rates of growth, profitability and risk.

The sample consists of three Swedish (Astra, Gambro and Pharmacia) and three UK (Glaxo, SmithKline Beecham and Wellcome) pharmaceutical companies, whose annual financial reports have been studied over the fifteen-year period 1984 - 98. The {{results show that the}} companies in both countries consistently have provided voluntary disclosures relevant for the assessment of competitive advantages, in particular with regard to research and development activities. Disclosures concerning business growth, dividend policy and earnings persistence, have been more prevalent among the Swedish companies, indicating a stronger concern about stock market investors. Voluntary segmental disclosures have been similar over time, with a reluctance to disclose line-of-business and <b>geographical</b> <b>segment</b> profits.

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the debate on segment reporting standards in the UK and Europe and, specifically, the merit of IFRS 8 relative to predecessor standards (SSAP 25 and IAS 14 R). We carry out a longitudinal analysis of segment reporting practices of a large sample of listed UK companies, covering all three reporting regimes. Using the Proprietary Cost Theory (PCT) as our theoretical lens, we present evidence consistent with PCT, that proprietary costs considerations influence companies’ segment disclosure choices. We show that when companies are required to disclose more detailed accounting information for <b>geographical</b> <b>segments</b> (e. g., when geography {{is the basis of}} operating segments, under IFRS 8, or primary segments, under IAS 14 R), they choose to define <b>geographical</b> <b>segments</b> in broader geographic areas terms than was the case under SSAP 25. We find that although companies disclose greater quantity of segmental information under IFRS 8 and IAS 14 R (than SSAP 25), the more recent standards brought about a notable reduction in (i) the level of specificity of the disclosed <b>geographical</b> <b>segments,</b> and (ii) the quantity of disclosed geographic segment profit data – {{one of the most important}} data types for users. While this may have reduced the proprietary costs of segment disclosures, the reduction in disclosure of segmental performance data may have reduced the usefulness of segment reports to investors...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} contains three {{essays on}} financial reporting, tax, and politics. The first essay explores whether the tax authority {{is able to}} generate spillover effects for auditors. The IRS can generate spillover effects for auditors, as a strong IRS increases manager’s incentives to comply with tax regulations, which causes auditors to reduce the assessment of audit risk. The main result in this essay is consistent with this prediction, as auditors demand lower audit fees in IRS districts where firms report higher GAAP effective tax rates. The second essay explores whether a firm’s commitment in providing disaggregated accounting information disciplines managers such that they provide more disaggregated forward looking disclosures. As of 1998, SFAS 131 allows US firms to withhold audited profitability accounting information on geographical segments. The results in this essay are consistent with a disciplining role for <b>geographical</b> <b>segment</b> information as {{the results indicate that}} firms that do not show commitment in continuing to provide segmented profitability accounting information reduce their disaggregated forward looking disclosures on foreign operations in the MD&A. The third essay explores whether firms use executive compensation to compensate managers for contributing their personal money to the political process. The results seem consistent with this expectation as firms that used corporate funds for contributing to politics, but were unable to do so after the adoption of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA) in 2002, increased their executive cash compensation. These firms increase salaries even more when investors react very negatively to the adoption of BCRA...|$|E
40|$|The {{nature of}} a {{corporate}} takeover often leads to the contraction {{in the number of}} companies operating in a given industry classification, along with the contraction in the amount of formal financial statements produced by the companies in that industry. Since 1985 Australian diversified companies are required to break their operations down into industry and geographical segments, so it would be expected that companies which diversify their operations through a corporate takeover would be forerunners in the adoption of this relatively new accounting standard on segment reporting. While previous studies have both declared the benefits of segment reporting to report users, and exposed some preconceived problems of its application in practice, there has not been any work on the 2 ̆ 7 usefulness 1 of segment reporting as a form of reporting that will compensate shareholder users for the information loss suffered during a corporate takeover. This study endeavours to determine this, by questioning shareholders of companies that have been involved in takeovers in a period subsequent to the application date of the segment reporting standard, and obtaining their views on the usefulness of the post-takeover segment reports produced by their companies. A link is discovered to exist between shareholder dissatisfaction with segment reporting and the non-practice of creating a new segment in the post-takeover annual report for the target acquired. The underlying assumption that the practice of new segment creation after a takeover is influenced by the type of takeover undertaken is supported by the study. Regardless of whether or not a company is diversified before the takeover, the findings show that a corporate acquirer in a takeover is less likely to create a new industry or <b>geographical</b> <b>segment</b> for the target acquired if they are involved in horizontal or vertical takeovers than if they are involved in diversified takeovers. In these situations, segment reporting is found to not compensate shareholders for the loss of information incurred by them in these types of takeovers...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{analyzes the}} effect of R 2 ̆ 6 D and advertising on profitability {{from the perspective of}} transfer pricing analysis. After providing a review of the theoretical and economic literature on R 2 ̆ 6 D and advertising, it examines the standard financial models applied to intangible asset valuation and finds them lacking. The dissertation then examines the empirical relationship between R 2 ̆ 6 D, advertising, and profitability in greater detail using financial data for publicly-listed manufacturing firms over the period 1950 – 1998. As expected, the analysis confirms that current-period advertising and R 2 ̆ 6 D {{have a significant impact on}} current-period profitability. For transfer pricing analysis, establishing the relative contribution of R 2 ̆ 6 D and advertising to profitability is an important consideration. These results suggest that the impact of advertising on profitability is considerably closer to the impact of R 2 ̆ 6 D than the literature review suggests. This dissertation also estimates various distributed lag models to determine the relative duration of advertising and R 2 ̆ 6 D, although these models do not provide robust results. As an alternative, an estimate of the relative duration of advertising and R 2 ̆ 6 D is derived from a financial market valuation approach. These results support the conclusion that the duration of advertising 2 ̆ 7 s effect on profitability is considerably closer to that of R 2 ̆ 6 D than previous studies have suggested. Both the relative magnitude and the relative duration of advertising and R 2 ̆ 6 D effects have important ramifications for transfer pricing policies. This dissertation then examines <b>geographical</b> <b>segment</b> data for manufacturing firms over the period 1991 – 1996, in order to determine whether there is evidence that is consistent with the hypothesis that MNCs use cross-border technology payments to minimize their overall tax burden. While the evidence is not conclusive, it does show that firms with greater R 2 ̆ 6 D intensity have greater profitability differences between the parent companies and their foreign locations, and that these profitability differences are positively correlated with tax differentials. These results suggest the need for greater clarity and consistency in the development of international tax regulations on intercompany transactions involving intangible assets. ...|$|E

According to their risk availability and business structure, <b>geographical</b> <b>segments</b> are divided into two types: geographical industrial and <b>geographical</b> marketing <b>segments.</b> Theoretically segmentation is expected to study marketing before the beginning of its certain activity.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to propose the {{expansion}} plan of selected company {{through the creation of}} franchise chain. Before processing a franchise plan, I have prepared - based on a literature review - a structure of individual documents of the franchise package. As a part of practical research, I analyzed the external environment using STEP analysis as well as the case studies of one competitor, and further I analyzed the internal environment of the company using primary data obtained during the controlled interview with the owner of the chosen company. Based on the above mentioned information, I elaborated a SWOT analysis and - using the defined strengths and weaknesses as well as the opportunities and threats - I determined the strategy for the expansion of the company consisting in selling of franchise license. This strategy is divided in two parts: the first part concerns the expansion within regional and district towns. In this case, the franchisor considers granting a licence to franchisees who will open always three appropriately allocated small business premises in order to achieve a minimum monthly revenue of 900. 000, - CZK. Over 5 years, i. e. from 2016 to 2020, the franchise prospectus counts with the acquisition of five franchisees; each of them has to establish three business premises in the selected <b>geographical</b> <b>segment.</b> Gross franchisor profit of the franchise chain amounts to 1. 284. 457, - CZK for the five years. The thesis focuses on this part of the expansion strategy. The prediction of annual costs, revenues, profits and cash flow of franchisee {{is a part of the}} franchise prospectus. I derived a gross profit of a franchisee in the first business year amounting to 1. 719. 496, - CZK, while the return on investment for the franchisee takes 2 years and 7 months. The second part of the strategy proposes the expansion to the capital. In order to achieve the highest possible turnover, it is useful first to expand the current business concept to the counter sale including seating space with several tables. Given that this form of provision of community feeding is connected with stricter legislative requirements such as the need of sanitary facilities for the guests, the concept must be first validated by the franchisor during a pilot operation...|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of network ties between multipoint competitors is frequently assumed but rarely examined directly. The outcomes of multipoint competition, therefore, are better understood than their underlying relational mechanisms. Using original fieldwork and data {{that we have}} collected on an interorganizational network of patient transfer relations within a regional community of hospitals, we report and interpret estimates of Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGM) that specify the probability of observing network ties between organizations {{as a function of}} the degree of their spatial multipoint contact. We find that hospitals competing more intensely for patients across multiple <b>geographical</b> <b>segments</b> of their market (spatial multipoint competitors) are significantly more likely to collaborate. This conclusion is robust to alternative explanations for the formation of network ties based on organizational size differences, resource complementarities, performance differentials, and capacity constraints. We show that interorganizational networks between spatial multipoint competitors are characterized by clear tendencies toward clustering and a global core-periphery structure arising as consequences of multiple mechanisms of triadic closure operating simultaneously. We conclude that the effects of competition on the structure of interorganizational fields depends on how markets as physical and social settings are connected by cross-cutting network ties between competitors...|$|R

The relevance of these are however declining, as {{the output of the}} benchmarks is decreasing, and as an increasing share of world crude produced is of worse quality than the benchmarks (pointed out by e. g. Montepeque, 2005). Particularly the segment of medium density, sour crudes is lacking a reliable benchmark. We apply Granger causality tests to study the price dependencies of 32 crude oils empirically. The aim is to establish what crudes are setting the prices and what crudes are just follow the general market trend. The investigation is performed globally as well as for different quality <b>segments,</b> <b>geographical</b> <b>segments</b> and the segments of OPEC and non-OPEC crudes. The results indicate that crude oil price analysts should follow at least four different crudes that are if not benchmarks, at least good price indicators. While the well-established benchmarks WTI and Brent still lead the market, they are not the only crude prices worth paying attention to. In particular, Russian Urals drives global prices in a significant way, and Iran Seri Kerir is a significant price setter within OPEC. Dubai Fateh does not display any significant influence as a price setter. The lack of a reliable benchmark for medium density, sour crudes is thereby confirmed. ...|$|R

The study provides evidence on factors that determine the voluntary adoption of corporate governance recommendations regarding remuneration committees in 2008. The findings indicate that remuneration committee existence is significantly associated with insider share ownership, institutional shareholding and marginally associated with change in CEO. Composition of the committee is significantly explained by independent directors and marginally explained by company complexity measured by <b>geographical</b> <b>segments.</b> The results suggest that agency costs and board capacity are incrementally relevant to adoption of the ASX remuneration committee recommendations, after controlling for company characteristics related to company size, governance quality, {{the appointment of a}} big 4 auditor and leverage. The results also indicate that companies are less likely to adopt the ASX remuneration committee recommendations in response to shareholder dissent on the annual remuneration report. The analysis then considers the association between adoption of the ASX remuneration committee recommendations and executive remuneration. Contrary to theoretical predications, the results infer that adoption of the ASX remuneration committee recommendations does not universally lead to more effective remuneration practices. Particularly, adoption of the ASX remuneration committee recommendations is associated in some cases with excessive levels of remuneration of the top five ranked executives and does not generally result in a stronger alignment between executives’ remuneration and measures of company performance...|$|R

Access, however, is multidimensional, and assessing its adequacy requires a review of (a) the range of financial services provided—and target groups served—by several tiers of formal, semiformal, and informal financial institutions; (b) the demand for financial services from households, microenterprises, and small businesses at different levels of the income strata; and (c) the different combinations of financial service providers, the users of those services, and the range of services that prevail in different <b>geographical</b> <b>segments</b> of the market.

Despite the most recent American Pet Products Association (APPA) data that nearly half the US population owns a dog, only 20 % acquired their dog from an animal welfare organization. Studies show that people consider adopting from an animal shelter more often than they actually do, which indicates a potential market increase if programs can make shelter dogs more visible to adopters. This research focused on a novel adoption program where shelter dogs were transferred into foster homes who were tasked with finding an adopter. Shelter dogs were placed in the path of potential adopters and bypassed the need for the adopter to go to the shelter. The results show that this novel program was effective {{in a variety of ways}} including getting dogs adopted. Although length of stay was significantly longer for dogs in the program, the dogs were in a home environment, not taking up kennel space in the shelter. The program also had a lower rate of returns than dogs adopted at the shelter. The foster program tapped adopters in different <b>geographical</b> <b>segments</b> of the community than the dogs adopted from the shelter. By bringing shelter dogs to where adopters spend their time (ex: restaurants, parks, hair salons), the program potentially captured a segment of the population who might have obtained their dog from other sources besides the shelter (such as breeders or pet stores).

It is motivated by the little available evidence concerning this potential effect as well as author’s experiences in audit profession. Workload pressure and workload compression are surrogated by busy season (i. e fiscal year end date in December), audit workload (i. e pressure degree of audit company on clients’ portfolio at certain point of time), audit concentration (i. e concentration of audit company on one client at certain point of time). Abnormal accrual is the proxy of audit quality. The main purpose of the study is to strengthen the results of prior research by López & Peters (2012), then requires management team of audit firms draw more attentions on preparing resources to ensure audit quality for all ongoing engagements. In other words, it requires audit partners become more prudent before accepting new clients, moreover, new regulations about the resource preparation should be issued to ensure the audit quality. Our study used a sample of 6, 500 observations between 2010 and 2013 from Compustat and Audit Analytics. The results show that busy season companies have higher abnormal accruals, in other words, workload compression and workload pressure negatively affect audit quality, which is consistent with prior researches. Moreover, our study found the company size and number of business <b>segments,</b> <b>geographical</b> <b>segments</b> and operating segments also affect audit quality.

40|$|The first {{ambition}} {{of this paper}} is to present and argue for a concept of non-economic markets based on specific values (power, truth, justice, religion, etc.). The problem with these values is that they can neither be directly compared with money nor with each other: truth may be power, but how much? Would you prefer health or truth? What is the (non-) economical return of a bachelor degree? Nonetheless, every day we compare these incommensurable values. So there must be informal exchange rates. The analysis of these trans-economic exchange rates is as important as the analysis of the exchange rates between currency systems within the economic system. Based on the Luhmannian concept of functional differentiation, we are sketching a future research program based on the analysis of value related items of micro-databases (like the European Social Survey, for example). These items will be assigned to distinctive value categories. The unit of analysis then will be the intensity of dis- /affirmation to value related items: the more extreme dis-/affirmation to values of a certain value category is expressed, the higher is the relevance of the value category. By comparing these absolute values of the value categories we will calculate their relative value. It will be most interesting to focus and to compare the specific exchange rates of certain <b>geographical</b> <b>segments</b> or levels of population of European society: do the French think that politics is more relevant than the economic system?

Design/methodology/approach – Data from annual reports for a pooled sample of 3, 154 company years were collected for listed Australian companies to determine MAS from auditors. Data for a second sample were collected by undertaking a survey of listed companies to provide a figure for total management advisory services paid to auditors and other consultants. Ordinary least squares regression was used to analyse the data and predict companies 2 ̆ 7 decision to outsource or internally generate MAS. Findings – It is found that purchases of MAS from external auditors and other consultants are associated with, restructuring, number of controlled entities (subsidiaries), number of <b>geographical</b> <b>segments,</b> management change and frequency of contracting. Other company characteristics, including company 2 ̆ 7 s industry membership, short-term growth, leverage, return on assets, use of a “big 5 ” auditor, type of audit report, and audit fees also explain the quantity of MAS purchased by a company from their external auditors and other consultants. Originality/value – Transaction cost economics has not previously been applied to explain the decision to generate MAS internally by assembling knowledge within the company versus outsourcing from auditors and other consultants.

40|$|The {{increased}} industry consolidation {{resulting in}} the formation of new highly organized forms of cooperation is referred as one of the main features of air transport globalization at the present stage. Consolidation allows carriers to overcome the excessive competition and to strengthen their market position. It also helps them to optimize the route network and organizational structure of the company. This article includes the analysis of the dynam-ics of global air passenger traffic by low-cost carriers in the period 2003 – 2015. An aggressive struggle for passengers in-creases competition in a low-cost environment while contributing to the consolidation process. In 2015 low-cost airlines provided 27. 1 % of global passenger air traffic. In absolute terms, the volume of traffic increased by 5 times from 197 mil-lion passengers in 2003 to 1100 million passengers in 2015. Those figures have significantly surpassed the dynamics of global passenger air traffic (from 1. 7 billion passengers in 2003 to 3. 5 billion passengers in 2015). The highest share of low-cost carriers is noticed in Southeast Asia. In 2015 due to the high level of competition a decreased was observed for the first time 15 years prompting the creation of the first budget airline alliances. U-FLY and Value Alliances which were founded in the beginning of 2016 represent the mechanism for competition with leading Asian independent low-cost groups. The main objective of joining the alliance for the participants is to in-crease their brand awareness in the Asia-Pacific region and to expand the distribution network. The benefits of airlines economic integration within alliances and long-haul low-cost subsidiaries enhance the competitiveness of low-cost carries under conditions of high global aviation market volatility.

The Odd’s ratios were: Marsabit 12. 1 (95 %CI: 8. 1 - 18. 1), Isiolo 7. 5 (95 %CI: 4. 4 - 12. 8) and Moyale 1. 9 (95 %CI: 0. 7 - 5. 6). A total of 1, 797 adults were examined and 54 (3. 0 %, 95 %CI: 2. 2 %- 3. 8 %) had TT. Women had higher prevalence of TT than men. Ten out of 13 persons with CO were from Moyale. The backlog of TT in the region was 2, 369 people and TT surgical services were poor. Moyale had the lowest prevalence of TF but the highest prevalence of TT. Conclusion: The survey methods used allowed differentiated interventions as follows: Marsabit needed full SAFE strategy; Moyale “S ” component and Isiolo repeat sub-district surveys. A Knowledge Attitude and Practice (KAP) was needed to explain the distribution of trachoma in the region...|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} {{aim of this}} study is to clarify the requirements of segment reporting and compare the requirements with the actual! implementation on different business lines. The empirical part was concluded by interviewing randomly selected companies that are publicly listed on the Helsinki Exchanges. The theoretical part of the study (chapters 2 and 3) will give basic information about shifting to IAS -standards and the requirements of IAS -standards. In order to meet the {{principal aim}}, a pre-empiric research was conducted by studying the annual accounts (year 2002) of randomly selected companies that already follow the IAS -standards of reporting. The companies in the pre-empiric research consist of both domestic and foreign companies. The aim of the pre-empiric study was to give a basis for the interview process on the empiric part of the study. The study indicates that implementing segment reporting has not brought any major concerns or problems. This is due to the fact that most companies that were examined - being publicly listed companies - have traditionally had a clear division between their <b>geographical</b> and commercial <b>segments,</b> and also been obliged to give reports according to these segments. In case of changes in corporate structure, shifting on new lines of businesses or downsizing of operations, the problems in reporting according to IAS -standards, may arise. Such changes will also require changes on information systems, providing the essential information for segment reporting. According to this study, most companies choose the commercial segment as their primary segment for reporting. The pre-empiric study indicates, that most of the companies already following the IAS -standards, still have a lot of improvement to do, in order to meet all the IAS requirements...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{relates to the}} {{discretionary}} segment financial disclosure practices of the Indian listed companies. The modern corporations are characterised by separation of management and ownership. This is an agency relationship where the principals or shareholders delegate the decision-making authority to their agents who are the managers of the corporation. Owing to this separation, and information asymmetry is created between the managers and the shareholders, which gives rise to agency cost. The agency cost is basically {{the reduction in the}} wealth of the shareholders which is caused by self-motivated actions of the managers. The disclosure of financial information is an effective way to monitor the managers by reducing information asymmetry between the managers and the outside shareholders. The prior literature has suggested that reducing information asymmetry would result in the decreasing the cost of capital and thereby enhance the firm performance. The better firm performance would potentially reflect in higher stock prices and thereby increase the shareholders’ wealth. Considering the importance of transparency, most of the countries have mandated disclosure of financial information though the extent of this disclosure may vary across the countries. Apart from the mandatory requirements, many listed corporations disclose additional financial information at their discretion. Prior research suggests that with better information, the lenders are prepared to accept slightly less returns which results in reduced cost of capital for the business. However, the aggregated or consolidated financial information has limited use in forecasting the earnings of a corporation which is operating in many industries. Therefore, it has been a long-standing demand of the analysts and investors that the corporations provide detailed financial information {{on the basis of their}} business and where applicable, on the basis of <b>geographical</b> <b>segments.</b> As a response to this demand, the regulatory authorities across the countries have made it mandatory for the listed companies to disclose detailed financial information for each of their segment. However, the situation is somewhat different for a corporation where majority of the shares are held by the management. In such situations, as the outside shareholders are in minority, the pressure for disclosure of financial information is weak. This is applicable to corporations where majority of the shareholding is in the hands of a single family. Concentrated corporate family-ownership is a common phenomenon in Asian countries, including India. In this situation, the managements has both an incentive and disincentive for the disclosure of detailed financial information, for example, segment-based financial information. There is an incentive because the disclosures would potentially help to reduce the cost of capital. At the same time, there is disincentive because the controlling family might not be prepared to share the private information about the corporation to which it has an exclusive access. The aim of the research is to explore the discretionary segment disclosure practices of listed family-owned firms in India with a view to find out if there is any association between family ownership and discretionary segment disclosures. The present study would help enhance our understanding of the agency cost theory which posits that firms make discretionary disclosures as it helps reduce agency costs and in turn the cost of capital. The present study examines the applicability of the theory in the context of firms that have predominant family ownership to test whether such firms follow the conventional behaviour of firms as postulated by the agency costs theory or otherwise. The research problem the present study poses can be stated in the following general form: How does family ownership impact the discretionary segment disclosures by listed corporations? In addressing this research problem, two main research issues, ten research questions and associated hypotheses were identified after a careful review of literature. The first research issue related to gaining an understanding of the association, if any, that exists between the principal constructs, family ownership and discretionary (voluntary) segment disclosures. The study also examined the link between discretionary segment disclosures and several other dimensions of family ownership such as concentration of family ownership, level of family ownership, the probability of low disclosures when family ownership is high, and the marginal impact of family ownership. Hypotheses 1 to 6 were proposed and tested to address this research issue. The second research issue examined the influence of size, leverage, overseas listing and proportion of assets-in-place on discretionary segment disclosures. Four research questions and associated hypotheses were proposed and tested. The study focused on family-owned firms that are listed on India’s largest stock exchange, the Bombay Stock Exchange. The Exchange published a directory of top 500 listed firms by market capitalisation. From this sampling frame, firms were classified into two categories, that is, family-owned firms (324) and other firms (176) and from each group, 15 per cent of the firms were chosen at random to yield a sample of 50 family-owned firms and 22 other firms. Hypotheses were tested using the logistic regression model, multinomial model and ordered choice model. The main finding of the study is that family ownership has an inverse relationship with voluntary disclosure of segment financial information in listed firms in India. The conclusion is important from the perspective of refinement of the extant theory of agency cost. The theory posits that the firms have an incentive to voluntarily disclose segment information as it helps to reduce agency costs and in turn the cost of capital. The present study finds that in family-owned firms the relationship between family ownership and discretionary disclosure of segment financial information is inverse which suggests that the incentive to retain control dominates the incentive to reduce agency costs. The study also finds that as the proportion of family ownership reaches to 25 per cent and above, there is significant decrease in discretionary segment disclosure. It means the desire to retain control dominates in such firms rather than the consideration of reducing agency costs...|$|R

We analyzed the pediatric ARV market from 2004 to 2012 and assessed pricing trends and associated factors. Data on donor funded procurements of pediatric ARV formulations reported to the Global Price Reporting Mechanism database from 2004 to 2012 were analyzed. Outcomes of interest were the volume and mean price per patient-year ARV formulation based on WHO ARV dosing recommendations for a 10  kg child. Factors associated {{with the price of}} formulations were assessed using linear regression; potential predictors included: country income classification, <b>geographical</b> region, market <b>segment</b> (originator versus generic ARVs), and number of manufacturers per formulation. All analyses were adjusted for type of formulations (single, dual or triple fixed-dose combinations (FDCs)) Data from 111 countries from 2004 to 2012 were included, with procurement of 33 formulations at a total value of USD 204 million. Use of dual and triple FDC formulations increased substantially over time, but with limited changes in price. Upon multivariate analysis, prices of originator formulations were found to be on average 72  % higher than generics (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). A 10  % increase in procurement volume was associated with a 1  % decrease (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) in both originator and generic prices. The entry of one additional manufacturer producing a formulation was associated with a decrease in prices of 2  % (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) and 8  % (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) for originator and generic formulations, respectively. The mean generic ARV price did not differ by country income level. Prices of originator ARVs were 48  % (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) and 14  % (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) higher in upper-middle income and lower-middle income countries compared to low income countries respectively, with the exception of South Africa, which had lower prices despite being an upper-middle income country. The donor funded pediatric ARV market as represented by the GPRM database is small, and lacks price competition. It is dominated by generic drugs due to the lower prices offered and the practicality of FDC formulations. This market requires continued donor support and the current initiatives to protect it are important to ensure market viability, especially if new formulations are to be introduced in the future...|$|R
