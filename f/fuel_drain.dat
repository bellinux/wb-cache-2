40|$|The Molten Salt Reactor Experiment Facility (MSRE) {{operated}} from 1965 to 1969. The fuel was a {{molten salt}} that flowed through the reactor core {{which consisted of}} uranium tetrafluoride with molten lithium and beryllium salt used as the coolant. In 1968 the fuel was switched from {sup 235 }U to {sup 233 }U. The Molten Salt Reactor Experiment was canceled in 1969 at which time approximately 4800 kg of salt {{was transferred to the}} <b>fuel</b> <b>drain</b> tanks. There was about 36. 3 kg of uranium, 675 grams of plutonium and various fission products present in the fuel salt. The salt was allowed to solidify in the <b>fuel</b> <b>drain</b> tanks. The salt was heated on a yearly basis to recombine the fluorine gas with the uranium salt mixture. In March 1994, a gas sample was taken from the off gas system that indicated {sup 233 }U had migrated from the <b>fuel</b> <b>drain</b> tank system to the off gas system. It was found that approximately 2. 6 kg of uranium had migrated to the Auxiliary Charcoal Bed (ACB). The ACB is located in the concrete-lined charcoal bed cell which is below ground level located outside the MSRE building. Therefore, there was a concern for the potential of a nuclear criticality accident, although water would have to leak into the chamber for a criticality accident to occur. Unstable carbon/fluorine compounds were also formed when the fluorine reacted with the charcoal in the charcoal bed. The purpose of the proposed measurement system was to perform an accountability measurement to determine the fissile mass of {sup 233 }U in the primary vessel. The contents of the primary containment assembly will then be transferred to three smaller containers for long term storage. Calculations were performed using MCNP-DSP to determine the configuration of the measurement system. The information obtained from the time signatures can then be compared to the measurement data to determine the amount of {sup 233 }U present in the primary containment assembly...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a preliminary criticality safety study of some potential effects of uranium reduction and aggregation in the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) <b>fuel</b> <b>drain</b> tanks (FDTs) during salt removal operations. Since the salt was transferred to the FDTs in 1969, radiological and chemical reactions have been converting the uranium and fluorine in the salt to UF{sub 6 } and free fluorine. Significant amounts of uranium (at least 3 kg) and fluorine have migrated out of the FDTs and into the off-gas system (OGS) and the auxiliary charcoal bed (ACB). The loss of uranium and fluorine from the salt changes the chemical properties of the salt sufficiently to possibly allow the reduction of the UF{sub 4 } in the salt to uranium metal as the salt is remelted prior to removal. It has been postulated that up to 9 kg of the maximum 19. 4 kg of uranium in one FDT could be reduced to metal and concentrated. This study shows that criticality becomes a concern when more than 5 kg of uranium concentrates to over 8 wt% of the salt in a favorable geometry...|$|E
40|$|A {{criticality}} analysis of Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) safety systems {{is carried out}} in this research. These systems are design {{to work in the}} event of an accident scenario, where a solid freeze plug (frozen fuel salt) melts, and the fuel salts volume drains into a number of storage tanks of non-critical geometry. For the purpose of this research, MONK Version 9 A Monte Carlo Program by ANSWERS Software Service was used to carry out the {{criticality analysis}} for the drain tanks using the design geometry and specifications of the Molten Salt Research Experiment (MSRE) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Tennessee-USA. We assumed the composition of the fluoride salt mixture in the <b>fuel</b> <b>drain</b> tank to be: 42. 16 wt % LiF, 35. 79 wt % BeF, 21 wt % ZrF 4, 1. 02 wt % UF 4, and 0. 02 wt % PuF 3. The safety margin for subcriticality was determined. The results obtained showed that the four storage tanks were significantly subcritical, as expected. The effective multiplication factor (Keff) as calculated by MONK for a salt volume of 1, 905, 870 cm 3 stored in four drain tanks of capacity 2, 271, 100 cm 3 (each) with a diameter of 127 cm is 0. 9076 (subcritical) ...|$|E
40|$|The Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) was {{operated}} from June 1965 to December 1969. The {{objective of}} the experiment {{was to investigate the}} practicality of developing a power reactor consisting of a graphite lattice with circulating molten uranium salt as fuel for application in central power stations. When the experiment was terminated in 1969, approximately 4710 kg of salt containing approximately 36. 3 kg of uranium, 675 g of plutonium, and various fission products were transferred to two <b>fuel</b> <b>drain</b> tanks (FDTs). The almost 30. 5 kg of Uranium 233 in the salt is the primary fissile constituent, but about 0. 93 kg of Uranium 235 is also present. In April 1994, a gas sample from the MSRE off-gas system (OGS) indicated that uranium had migrated from the FDTs into the OGS. Further investigation revealed a likely accumulation of approximately 2. 6 kg of uranium in the auxiliary charcoal bed (ACB), which is located in the concrete-lined charcoal bed cell (CBC) below ground level outside the MSRE building. The nuclear criticality safety (NCS) situation was further complicated by the CBC being filled with water up to the overflow pipe, which completely submerged the ACB. Thus there was not only an increased risk of criticality because of water reflection in the ACB, but also because of potential moderation in the ACB in case of water inleakage. Leakage into the ACB would result in a direct path for water between the CBC and the OGS or FDTs, thus increasing the risk of criticality in these areas. When uranium was discovered in the ACB, a number of steps, detailed in this report, were immediately taken to try to understand and ameliorate the situation. After all the actions were completed, a validation of the results obtained for the ACB was performed...|$|E

40|$|This {{evaluation}} {{was performed}} by Pro 2 Serve {{in accordance with the}} Technical Specification for an Engineering Evaluation of the Proposed Alternative Salt Transfer Method for the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (BJC 2009 b). The evaluators reviewed the Engineering Evaluation Work Plan for Molten Salt Reactor Experiment Residual Salt Removal, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee (DOE 2008). The Work Plan (DOE 2008) involves installing a salt transfer probe and new drain line into the <b>Fuel</b> <b>Drain</b> Tanks and Fuel Flush Tank and connecting them to the new salt transfer line at the drain tank cell shield. The probe is to be inserted through the tank ball valve and the molten salt {{to the bottom of the}} tank. The tank would then be pressurized through the Reactive Gas Removal System to force the salt into the salt canisters. The Evaluation Team reviewed the work plan, interviewed site personnel, reviewed numerous documents on the Molten Salt Reactor (Sects. 7 and 8), and inspected the probes planned to be used for the transfer. Based on several concerns identified during this review, the team recommends not proceeding with the salt transfer via the proposed alternate salt transfer method. The major concerns identified during this evaluation are: (1) Structural integrity of the tanks - The main concern is with the corrosion that occurred during the fluorination phase of the uranium removal process. This may also apply to the salt transfer line for the Fuel Flush Tank. Corrosion Associated with Fluorination in the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Fluoride Volatility Process (Litman 1961) shows that this problem is significant. (2) Continued generation of Fluorine - Although the generation of Fluorine will be at a lower rate than experienced before the uranium removal, it will continue to be generated. This needs to be taken into consideration regardless of what actions are taken with the salt. (3) More than one phase of material - There are likely multiple phases of material in the salt (metal or compound), either suspended through the salt matrix, layered in the bottom of the tank, or both. These phases may contribute to plugging during any planned transfer. There is not enough data to know for sure. (4) Probe heat trace - The alternate transfer method does not include heat tracing of the bottom of the probe. There is a concern that this may cool the salt and other phases of materials present enough to block the flow of salt. (5) Stress-corrosion cracking - Additionally, there is a concern regarding moisture that may have been introduced into the tanks. Due to time constraints, this concern was not validated. However, if moisture was introduced into the tanks and not removed during heating the tanks before HF and F 2 sparging, there would be an additional concern regarding the potential for stress-corrosion cracking of the tank walls...|$|E

Natural water resources are very limited to meet this growth, and as result, desalted seawater in Kuwait became the main source of potable water, about 93 % in 2002. The electric power and desalted water, produced in co-generation power desalting plants (CPDP), consumptions are continuously increasing, almost doubled every 10 years, due to population and standard of living increases. This led to the consumption of huge amounts of <b>fuel,</b> <b>draining</b> the country main fuel (and income) resource, and negatively affecting the environment. One tenth of Kuwait’s oil production was consumed by the CPDP in 2003. If the trend of almost doubling the consumption every 10 years prevails, the total oil production may not be sufficient to desalt seawater for people to drink, and to produce power to run space air conditioning units (a necessity for Kuwaiti harsh weather). It is essential therefore to look for energy efficient ways to produce power and desalted water so as to save the nation’s income of these non-renewable fuel resources, to save the environment and indeed life itself in Kuwait, and this is the objective of this paper. It reviews the presently used desalting methods and their energy demand, and the correctness of fuel allocation formulas for CPDP, to determine the most efficient methods to apply and the less efficient ones to avoid.
