30|$|Handover {{measurements}} {{in mobile}} communications systems, i.e. measurements that are performed by UEs on neighbouring cells {{while they are}} connected to a serving cell, are typically related to the so-called Physical Cell ID (PCI) of a neighbour cell. PCIs are tightly coupled to the used radio technology and are relatively easy to detect (which is important so that such measurements do not unnecessarily interrupt the ongoing communication in the serving cell). Such PCIs are however never unique, i.e. the actual global identity of the cell (which is, e.g. needed to organise the handover within the network) cannot be directly derived from a PCI. Therefore, the network needs a mapping table which depending on the geographic location of a cell provides a mapping between measured PCIs and global identifiers of the neighbouring cells. The ANR function in LTE [25] automates the creation and maintenance of such mapping tables and frees the operator from this relatively trivial and cumbersome task. This is achieved by asking UEs to retrieve and report the <b>global</b> <b>cell</b> <b>identity</b> of neighbour cells in periods in which the UE has no data activity in the serving cell and therefore is able to temporarily abandon the serving cell {{to listen to the}} broadcasted system information of the neighbour cell (in which the <b>global</b> <b>cell</b> <b>identity</b> is contained). When an eNB has detected a new neighbour, it will not only update its internal mapping tables but will also establish a connection via the X 2 interface to the corresponding neighbour eNB which then enables exchange of information for other SON purposes like MRO and MLB. Furthermore, ANR provides the basis for self-configuration and self-optimisation of the PCI allocation to cells, i.e. PCI allocation (for new or already existing cells) can be adapted to the PCIs of the neighbour cells and to the PCIs of the neighbours of the neighbour cells.|$|E

With the rigorous growth of cellular network many mobility datasets are available publically, which attracted researchers to study human mobility fall under spatio-temporal phenomenon. Mobility profile building is main task in spatio-temporal trend analysis {{which can be}} extracted from the location information available in the dataset. The location information is usually gathered through the GPS, service provider assisted faux GPS and <b>Cell</b> <b>Global</b> <b>Identity</b> (CGI).

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the University of Bedfordshire in partial ful lment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of PhilosophyFemtocell is a small cellular base station used by operators to extend indoor service coverage and enhance overall network performance. In Long Term Evolution (LTE), femtocell works under macrocell coverage and combines with the macrocell to constitute the two-tier network. Compared to the traditional single-tier network, the two-tier scenario creates many new challenges, which lead to the 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) implementing an automation technology called Self-Organising Network (SON) {{in order to achieve}} lower cost and enhanced network performance. This thesis focuses on the inbound and outbound handovers (handover between femtocell and macrocell); in detail, it provides suitable solutions for the intensity of femtocell handover prediction, Physical <b>Cell</b> <b>Identity</b> (PCI) allocation and handover triggering parameter optimisation. Moreover, those solutions are implemented in the structure of SON. In order to e ciently manage radio resource allocation, this research investigates the conventional UE-based prediction model and proposes a cell-based prediction model to predict the intensity of a femtocell's handover, which overcomes the drawbacks of the conventional models in the two-tier scenario. Then, the predictor is used in the proposed dynamic group PCI allocation approach in order {{to solve the problem of}} PCI allocation for the femtocells. In addition, based on SON, this approach is implemented in the structure of a centralised Automated Con guration of Physical <b>Cell</b> <b>Identity</b> (ACPCI). It overcomes the drawbacks of the conventional method by reducing inbound handover failure of <b>Cell</b> <b>Global</b> <b>Identity</b> (CGI). This thesis also tackles optimisation of the handover triggering parameters to minimise handover failure. A dynamic hysteresis-adjusting approach for each User Equipment (UE) is proposed, using received average Reference Signal-Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (RS-SINR) of the UE as a criterion. Furthermore, based on SON, this approach is implemented in the structure of hybrid Mobility Robustness Optimisation (MRO). It is able to off er the unique optimised hysteresis value to the individual UE in the network. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach against existing methods, a System Level Simulation (SLS) tool, provided by the Centre for Wireless Network Design (CWiND) research group, is utilised, which models the structure of two-tier communication of LTE femtocell-based networks...|$|R

Regulatory T (Treg) cells, specified by the transcription factor Foxp 3, are indispensable for immune system homeostasis. Here, we report that conserved noncoding sequence 2 (CNS 2), a CpG-rich Foxp 3 intronic cis-element specifically demethylated in mature Tregs, helps maintain immune homeostasis and limit autoimmune disease development by protecting Treg identity in response to signals that shape mature Treg functions and drive their initial differentiation. In activated Tregs, CNS 2 helps protect Foxp 3 expression from destabilizing cytokine conditions by sensing TCR/NFAT activation, which facilitates the interaction between CNS 2 and Foxp 3 promoter.

One solution to mobile carriers, {{which can help}} them quickly deploy small base stations (BS) ensuring great indoor coverage with minimum costs, and high data rate capability, is femtocell technology. However, standard deployment techniques are unsatisfactory for these type of BSs. There are two main reasons for that. Firstly, femtocells will be deployed in great numbers. Secondly, they are deployed by users and are portable. It means their position is not known in advance, and can vary in time. Therefore, femtocells have to implement self-configuration principles. Physical <b>Cell</b> <b>Identity</b> {{is one of the}} most important parameters to be chosen automatically under defined conditions. It is crucial parameter, which allows them to convey a communication between a user equipment and a core network. A study on Physical <b>Cell</b> <b>Identity</b> issues in mobile networks with femtocells is presented in my thesis. For this purpose, I created two different models of femtocells deployment and deal with a collision and a confusion. They are two main problems, which threaten proper Physical <b>Cell</b> <b>Identity</b> assignment in mobile networks. Outputs of the thesis serves for better understanding of interrelations between differently placed femtocells in term of collision and confusion issue and as the basis to design the framework handling Physical <b>Cell</b> <b>Identity</b> allocation.
