5|$|Although {{distinctly}} {{different from each}} other, <b>DNA</b> <b>damage</b> and mutation are related because <b>DNA</b> <b>damage</b> often causes errors of DNA synthesis during replication or repair; these errors are {{a major source of}} mutation.|$|E
5|$|Checkpoint Proteins can be {{separated}} into four groups: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-like protein kinase, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-like group, two serine/threonine(S/T) kinases and their adaptors. Central to all <b>DNA</b> <b>damage</b> induced checkpoints responses {{is a pair}} of large protein kinases belonging to the first group of PI3K-like protein kinases-the ATM (Ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (Ataxia- and Rad-related) kinases, whose sequence and functions have been well conserved in evolution. All <b>DNA</b> <b>damage</b> response requires either ATM or ATR because they have the ability to bind to the chromosomes at the site of <b>DNA</b> <b>damage,</b> together with accessory proteins that are platforms on which <b>DNA</b> <b>damage</b> response components and DNA repair complexes can be assembled.|$|E
5|$|Given these {{properties}} of <b>DNA</b> <b>damage</b> and mutation, {{it can be}} seen that <b>DNA</b> <b>damage</b> is a special problem in non-dividing or slowly-dividing cells, where unrepaired damage will tend to accumulate over time. On the other hand, in rapidly-dividing cells, unrepaired <b>DNA</b> <b>damage</b> that does not kill the cell by blocking replication will tend to cause replication errors and thus mutation. The great majority of mutations that are not neutral in their effect are deleterious to a cell's survival. Thus, in a population of cells composing a tissue with replicating cells, mutant cells will tend to be lost. However, infrequent mutations that provide a survival advantage will tend to clonally expand at the expense of neighboring cells in the tissue. This advantage to the cell is disadvantageous to the whole organism, because such mutant cells can give rise to cancer. Thus, <b>DNA</b> <b>damage</b> in frequently dividing cells, because it gives rise to mutations, is a prominent cause of cancer. In contrast, <b>DNA</b> <b>damage</b> in infrequently-dividing cells is likely a prominent cause of aging.|$|E
5000|$|While <b>DNA</b> <b>damages</b> {{may give}} rise to {{mutations}} through error prone translesion synthesis, <b>DNA</b> <b>damages</b> can also {{give rise to}} epigenetic alterations during faulty DNA repair processes. [...] The <b>DNA</b> <b>damages</b> that accumulate due to hypermethylation of the promoters of DNA repair genes can {{be a source of}} the increased epigenetic alterations found in many genes in cancers.|$|R
50|$|The chart in {{this section}} shows some {{frequent}} <b>DNA</b> <b>damaging</b> agents, examples of DNA lesions they cause, and the pathways that deal with these <b>DNA</b> <b>damages.</b> At least 169 enzymes are either directly employed in DNA repair or influence DNA repair processes. Of these, 83 are directly employed in repairing the 5 types of <b>DNA</b> <b>damages</b> illustrated in the chart.|$|R
50|$|Steady-state {{levels of}} {{endogenous}} <b>DNA</b> <b>damages</b> represent {{the balance between}} formation and repair. Swenberg et al. measured average amounts of steady state endogenous <b>DNA</b> <b>damages</b> in mammalian cells. The seven most common damages they found are shown in Table 1. Only one directly oxidized base, 8-hydroxyguanine, at about 2,400 8-OH-G per cell, {{was among the most}} frequent <b>DNA</b> <b>damages</b> present in the steady-state.|$|R

Moreover, determination of the impact of Detralex usage on the level of (oxidative) <b>DNA</b> <b>damages</b> in CVD patients was evaluated as well. The degree of oxidative <b>DNA</b> <b>damages</b> was studied in a group consisted of thirty patients with diagnosed chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) in the 2 nd and 3 rd degree, according to clinical state, etiology, anatomy and pathophysiology (CEAP), and qualified to surgical procedure. The control group consisted of normal volunteers (blood donors) qualified during standard examinations at Regional Centers of Blood Donation and Blood Therapy. The comet assay was used for determination of <b>DNA</b> <b>damages.</b> Analyses of the obtained results showed increase in the level of oxidative/alkali-labile <b>DNA</b> <b>damages</b> in lymphocytes originating from antebrachial blood of CVD patients as compared to the control group (Control) (p < 0. 002; ANOVA). In addition, it was demonstrated that the usage of Detralex ® resulted in decrease of the level of oxidative/alkali-labile <b>DNA</b> <b>damages</b> in CVD patients as compared to patients without Detralex ® treatment (p < 0. 001; ANOVA).

5|$|After <b>DNA</b> <b>damage,</b> {{cell cycle}} checkpoints are activated. Checkpoint {{activation}} pauses the cell cycle {{and gives the}} cell time {{to repair the damage}} before continuing to divide. <b>DNA</b> <b>damage</b> checkpoints occur at the G1/S and G2/M boundaries. An intra-S checkpoint also exists. Checkpoint activation is controlled by two master kinases, ATM and ATR. ATM responds to DNA double-strand breaks and disruptions in chromatin structure, whereas ATR primarily responds to stalled replication forks. These kinases phosphorylate downstream targets in a signal transduction cascade, eventually leading to cell cycle arrest. A class of checkpoint mediator proteins including BRCA1, MDC1, and 53BP1 has also been identified. These proteins seem to be required for transmitting the checkpoint activation signal to downstream proteins.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} downstream {{target of}} ATM and ATR is p53, {{as it is}} required for inducing apoptosis following <b>DNA</b> <b>damage.</b> The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 is induced by both p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms and can arrest the cell cycle at the G1/S and G2/M checkpoints by deactivating cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase complexes.|$|E

50|$|P. patens is an {{excellent}} model in which to analyze repair of <b>DNA</b> <b>damages</b> in plants by the homologous recombination pathway. Failure to repair double-strand breaks and other <b>DNA</b> <b>damages</b> in somatic cells by homologous recombination can lead cell dysfunction or death, and when failure occurs during meiosis, it can cause loss of gametes. The genome sequence of P. patens has revealed the presence of numerous genes that encode proteins necessary for repair of <b>DNA</b> <b>damages</b> by homologous recombination and by other pathways. RpRAD51, a protein {{at the core of}} the homologous recombination repair reaction, is required to preserve genome integrity in P. patens. Loss of RpRAD51 causes marked hypersensitivity to the double-strand break-inducing agent bleomycin, indicating that homologous recombination is used for repair of somatic cell <b>DNA</b> <b>damages.</b> RpRAD51 is also essential for resistance to ionizing radiation.|$|R
5|$|<b>DNA</b> <b>damage</b> {{checkpoint}} is {{a signal}} transduction pathway that blocks cell cycle progression in G1, G2 and metaphase and slows down {{the rate of}} S phase progression when DNA is damaged. It leads to a pause in cell cycle allowing the cell time {{to repair the damage}} before continuing to divide.|$|E
5|$|Oxidative {{damage in}} DNA can cause cancer. Several {{antioxidant}} enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase etc. protect DNA from oxidative stress. It {{has been proposed}} that polymorphisms in these enzymes are associated with <b>DNA</b> <b>damage</b> and subsequently the individual's risk of cancer susceptibility.|$|E
5|$|The DNA repair {{ability of}} a cell {{is vital to the}} {{integrity}} of its genome and thus to the normal functionality of that organism. Many genes that were initially shown to influence life span {{have turned out to be}} involved in <b>DNA</b> <b>damage</b> repair and protection.|$|E
25|$|During {{repair of}} DNA double strand breaks, or repair of other <b>DNA</b> <b>damages,</b> incompletely cleared sites of repair can cause {{epigenetic}} gene silencing. DNA repair deficiencies (level 4 in the figure) cause increased <b>DNA</b> <b>damages</b> (level 5 in the figure) which result in increased somatic mutations and epigenetic alterations (level 6 in the figure).|$|R

5|$|All in all, a GRB {{within a}} few parsecs, with its energy {{directed}} towards Earth, will mostly damage life by raising the UV levels during the burst itself {{and for a few}} years thereafter. Models show that the destructive effects of this increase can cause up to 16 times the normal levels of <b>DNA</b> <b>damage.</b> It has proved difficult to assess a reliable evaluation of the consequences of this on the terrestrial ecosystem, because of the uncertainty in biological field and laboratory data.|$|E
5|$|<b>DNA</b> <b>damage,</b> due to {{environmental}} factors and normal metabolic processes inside the cell, occurs {{at a rate}} of 10,000 to 1,000,000 molecular lesions per cell per day. While this constitutes only 0.000165% of the human genome's approximately 6 billion bases (3 billion base pairs), unrepaired lesions in critical genes (such as tumor suppressor genes) can impede a cell's ability to carry out its function and appreciably increase the likelihood of tumor formation and contribute to tumour heterogeneity.|$|E
5|$|The extremophile Deinococcus radiodurans has a {{remarkable}} {{ability to survive}} <b>DNA</b> <b>damage</b> from ionizing radiation and other sources. At least two copies of the genome, with random DNA breaks, can form DNA fragments through annealing. Partially overlapping fragments are then used for synthesis of homologous regions through a moving D-loop that can continue extension until they find complementary partner strands. In the final step there is crossover by means of RecA-dependent homologous recombination.|$|E

5|$|When the hyperthermophilic archaea Sulfolobus solfataricus and Sulfolobus acidocaldarius {{are exposed}} to the DNA {{damaging}} agents UV irradiation, bleomycin or mitomycin C, species-specific cellular aggregation is induced. Aggregation in S.solfataricus could not be induced by other physical stressors, such as pH or temperature shift, suggesting that aggregation is induced specifically by <b>DNA</b> <b>damage.</b> Ajon et al. showed that UV-induced cellular aggregation mediates chromosomal marker exchange with high frequency in S.acidocaldarius. Recombination rates exceeded those of uninduced cultures by up to three orders of magnitude. Frols et al. and Ajon et al. hypothesized that cellular aggregation enhances species specific DNA transfer between Sulfolobus cells in order to provide increased repair of damaged DNA by means of homologous recombination. This response may be a primitive form of sexual interaction similar to the more well-studied bacterial transformation systems that are also associated with species specific DNA transfer between cells leading to homologous recombinational repair of <b>DNA</b> <b>damage.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Proteins {{recognizing}} <b>DNA</b> <b>damaged</b> by {{the chemical}} carcinogen N-acetoxy-acetylaminofluorene (AAAF) were analyzed in nuclear extracts from rat tissues, using a 36 bp oligonucleotide as the substrate and an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Two major proteins that form complexes with <b>DNA</b> <b>damaged</b> by AAAF were detected; {{one of them}} also bound <b>DNA</b> <b>damaged</b> by cis-diammine-dichloroplatinum. The complex specific for AAAF-damaged DNA contained protein loosely attached to nuclear components. It was extracted with 0. 1 M NaCl. The amount of this protein was estimated at about 10 5 copies per liver cell nucleus, and its probable size was about 42 kDa as detected by the Southwestern blotting assay. Its affinity for <b>DNA</b> <b>damaged</b> by AAAF was ~ 10 -fold higher than that for undamaged DNA. Analogous AAAF-DDB (damaged-DNA-binding) proteins were also detected in extracts from rat brain, testis and kidney tissue. The levels of such proteins were not affected in rats treated with the carcinogen 2 -acetylaminofluorene...|$|R

50|$|However {{more recent}} {{evidence}} indicates that competence for transformation is, indeed, specifically induced by <b>DNA</b> <b>damaging</b> conditions. For instance, Claverys et al. in 2006 showed that the <b>DNA</b> <b>damaging</b> agents mitomycin C (a DNA cross-linking agent) and fluoroquinolone (a topoisomerase inhibitor that causes double-strand breaks) induce transformation in Streptococcus pneumoniae. In addition, Engelmoer and Rozen in 2011 demonstrated that in S. pneumoniae transformation protects against the bactericidal effect of mitomycin C. Induction of competence further protected against the antibiotics kanomycin and streptomycin. Although these aminoglycoside antibiotics were previously regarded as non-DNA damaging, recent studies in 2012 of Foti et al. showed that {{a substantial portion of}} their bactericidal activity results from release of the hydroxyl radical and induction of <b>DNA</b> <b>damages,</b> including double-strand breaks.|$|R
