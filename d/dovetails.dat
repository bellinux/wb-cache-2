25|$|There are {{two main}} {{categories}} of vise (vice in UK English sp.) : vises {{on the end of}} the bench and vises on the front of the bench. End vises (also called 'tail vises') are usually mounted on the right side of the bench for right-handed workers. They can typically hold work in two ways: between the jaws and along the top of the bench using moveable 'dogs' in place of jaws. Not all benches have tail vises. A front vise (also called 'face vise' or 'shoulder vise') is typically mounted on the left front side of the bench. They may be used for holding a board to be edge jointed, or sometimes for sawing out <b>dovetails</b> and the like.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dovetail</b> slides, or <b>dovetail</b> way slides are {{typically}} constructed from cast iron, {{but can also}} be constructed from hard-coat aluminum, acetal or stainless steel. Like any bearing, a <b>dovetail</b> slide is composed of a stationary linear base and a moving carriage. a <b>Dovetail</b> carriage has a v-shaped, or dovetail-shaped protruding channel which locks into the linear base's correspondingly shaped groove. Once the <b>dovetail</b> carriage is fitted into its base's channel, the carriage is locked into the channel's linear axis and allows free linear movement. When a platform {{is attached to the}} carriage of a <b>dovetail</b> slide, a <b>dovetail</b> table is created, offering extended load carrying capabilities.|$|R

25|$|In his {{welcoming}} {{address for}} the fall 2007 semester, former CSU President Larry Edward Penley called for CSU to {{set the standard for}} the 21st century public land-grant research university. He has identified as the heart of this ideal the contribution to the prosperity and quality of life of the local and international community, in part through fostering relationships and collaborations with federal research partners, the business community and key industries. A part of this approach is Colorado State's new Supercluster research model, designed to utilize interdisciplinary, issue-based research on pressing global issues in which the university has particular expertise and connect research results to the marketplace. Initial Superclusters in infectious disease and in cancer research have been launched, and an upcoming clean energy Supercluster <b>dovetails</b> with an overall emphasis on campus sustainability. A wind farm is being built to power the main campus, and new residence halls have been constructed according to national green building standards. A sustainability advisory committee has been charged to coordinate green activities at Colorado State.|$|E

50|$|Since <b>dovetail</b> slides {{have such}} a large surface contact area, a greater force is {{required}} to move the saddle than other linear slides, which results in slower acceleration rates. Additionally, <b>dovetail</b> slides have difficulties with high-friction but are advantageous {{when it comes to}} load capacity, affordability and durability. Capable of long travel, <b>dovetail</b> slides are more resistant to shock than other bearings, and they are mostly immune to chemical, dust and dirt contamination. <b>Dovetail</b> slides can be motorized, mechanical or electromechanical. Electric <b>dovetail</b> slides are driven by a number of different devices, such as ball screws, belts and cables, which are powered by functional motors such as stepper motors, linear motors and handwheels. <b>Dovetail</b> slides are direct contact systems, making them fitting for heavy load applications including CNC machines, shuttle devices, special machines and work holding devices. Mainly used in the manufacturing and laboratory science industries, <b>dovetail</b> slides are ideal for high-precision applications.|$|R

500|$|The stones, {{as smooth}} as {{polished}} marble, were laid without mortar with very tight joints that are sometimes hard to find. The blocks were held together by mortise and tenon joints in some cases, while in others they used <b>dovetails</b> and gravity.

Henri Mouhot noted that most of the blocks had holes [...] in diameter and [...] deep, with more holes on the larger blocks. Some scholars have suggested that these were used to join them together with iron rods, but others claim they were used to hold temporary pegs to help manoeuvre them into place.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "Third Wave" [...] was a term he coined to {{describe}} the post-industrial society, {{which began in the}} late 1950s.

Though the film opens with Bell speaking, much of what he says in the book is condensed and it turns up in other forms. Also, Bell has an entire backstory in the book that doesn't make it into the film. The result is a movie that is more simplified thematically, but one that gives more of the characters an opportunity to shine." ...|$|E

2500|$|Another {{old design}} is the {{shoulder}} vise. The {{best thing about}} this design {{is that it allows}} clamping directly behind the screw. This yields unobstructed vertical clamping for cutting <b>dovetails</b> and similar operations. There is also typically a little play in the screw/jaw attachment that provides for clamping of tapered work. This is one vise that should be designed into the bench from the beginning, as it is difficult to retrofit into an existing bench. The primary drawback of the shoulder vise is its fragility, unless the [...] "arm" [...] is attached to the [...] "end cap" [...] using a dovetail or finger joint, usually glued or [...] "pinned" [...] to eliminate rotative movement about the joint, otherwise it is fairly easy to break it with a big steel bench screw. But one should never really have to put that much force on it. Some woodworkers say that the big vise {{gets in the way of}} some jobs, others find it unobtrusive. Implicit in a shoulder vise is an integral planing stop, formed by the intersection of the jaw and the jaw spacer, and which allows the shoulder vise to perform multiple duties, such as jointing long boards with a [...] "bench slave" [...] to hold the opposite end. In earlier times, a crochet and a holdfast would perform the same function.|$|E

Each course was thus built from its centre to its circumference, and as all the courses from the foundation to a height of thirty feet were built in this way, the tower, up to that height, became a mass of solid stone, as strong and immovable as the Bell Rock itself. Above this, or thirty feet from the foundation, the entrance-door was placed, and the hollow part of the tower began.|$|E
60|$|Most of us {{remember}} Retzsch's drawing of destiny {{in the shape}} of Mephistopheles playing at chess with man for his soul, a game in which we may imagine the clever adversary making a feint of unintended moves so as to set the beguiled mortal on carrying his defensive pieces away from the true point of attack. The fiend makes preparation his favorite object of mockery, that he may fatally persuade us against our taking out waterproofs when he is well aware the sky is going to clear, foreseeing that the imbecile will turn this delusion into a prejudice against waterproofs instead of giving a closer study to the weather-signs.

40|$|Robust {{synchronous}} {{permanent magnet}} and reluctance machine designs are developed. In the designs, the rotor structure {{is simple and}} strong and the leakage flux is relatively small. For the new design solution, a <b>dovetail</b> form-blocked rotor structure, specific analyzing principles are also developed. The <b>dovetail</b> designs are shown to be good solutions with their lower leakage flux and at least the same strength against centrifugal forces as the conventional rotor solutions. The compared conventional solutions considered have inseparable rotor sheets in which {{the parts of the}} rotor are kept still by using bridges between them. In the <b>dovetail</b> rotor, the forms of the rotor parts keep them together and no bridges between them are needed for support. The simplicity of the <b>dovetail</b> solution has also been kept the same or better. In addition, the manufacturing method is the same for both solutions. The <b>dovetail</b> design can also be used for saving the magnetic material of permanent magnet synchronous machines because it has a smaller leakage flux than the conventional V-shaped designs with supporting bridges. The problem of how to compare the <b>dovetail</b> designs to the conventional ones is considered in depth. The strength of the <b>dovetail</b> structure has to be defined in a different way than in the conventional design with supporting bridges. In bridge-fixed design, the strength of the bridges is critical for rotor durability but in the <b>dovetail</b> design wider areas of the rotor affect the strength of the rotor. However, the basic electrical properties could be defined with the same method. Additional methods for defining the electrical properties of <b>dovetail</b> designs are also considered. One method is that the load angle can be defined only from the forms of phase currents in delta-connected synchronous machines and phase voltage and current in star-connected synchronous machines. The load angles defined are successfully used to find a good model for the test results. The other method is to view the normalized local torque density in the air gap as a function of time. In this work, several <b>dovetail</b> synchronous reluctance and permanent magnet machines are designed, manufactured, tested, and analyzed. The design, manufacturing, testing, and analysis methods are defined and developed especially for <b>dovetail</b> designs...|$|R
