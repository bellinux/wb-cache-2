5|$|Not listed {{is perhaps}} the most notable 'acquisition', the 2001 merger with Time Warner to become AOL Time Warner.

AOL was spun off as its own independent company from Time Warner in 2009.|$|E

The managers, Anthony Walker (Balfour Beatty's rail maintenance director), Nicholas Jeffries (its civil engineer), Railtrack's Alistair Cook and Sean Fugill (asset managers for the London North-East zone), and track engineer Keith Lee, all denied the charges. The corporate manslaughter charges against Network Rail/Railtrack and some of <b>its</b> <b>executives</b> were dropped in September 2004, but the other charges stood.|$|E
5|$|The private Cloud Club {{formerly}} {{occupied the}} 66th through 68th floors. It opened in July 1930 with some three hundred members, all wealthy males who formed the city's elite. Its creation was spurred by Texaco's wish {{for a proper}} restaurant for <b>its</b> <b>executives</b> prior to renting fourteen floors in the building. The Cloud Club was a compromise between William van Alen's modern style and Walter Chrysler's stately and traditional tastes. A member had to be elected, and if accepted, paid an initial fee of $200, plus a $150 to $300 annual fee.|$|E

The plan called for KKR to complete a reverse takeover of its listed affiliate KKR Private Equity Investors {{in exchange for a}} 21% interest in the firm. In November 2008, KKR announced a delay of this transaction until 2009. Shares of KPE had declined significantly {{in the second half of}} 2008 with the onset of the credit crunch. KKR has announced that it expects to close the transaction in 2009. In October 2009, KKR listed shares in KKR & Co. on the Euronext exchange, replacing KPE and anticipates a listing on the New York Stock Exchange in 2010. The public entity represents a 30% interest in Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. In October 2010, KKR acquired about nine members of Goldman Sachs Group proprietary trading team after entertaining offers from investment firms such as Perella Weinberg and Blackrock. With Goldman shutting down its proprietary trading operations, <b>its</b> <b>executives,</b> led by Bob Howard, will help KKR expand beyond leveraged buyouts into areas such as hedge funds.|$|E

25|$|The coup was {{executed}} on 19 September 2006 while Thaksin was attending a UN summit, {{just weeks before}} a planned Parliamentary election. The junta canceled the elections, abrogated the Constitution, dissolved Parliament, banned protests and all political activities, suppressed and censored the media, declared martial law, and arrested Cabinet members. The PAD voluntarily dissolved after announcing that its goals had been accomplished. Surayud Chulanont, Prem's former close aide, was appointed Prime Minister. A junta-appointed court banned the TRT and 111 of <b>its</b> <b>executives</b> from politics for five years. Privy Council President Prem harshly criticized Thaksin, who was in exile, comparing him to Adolf Hitler. A junta-appointed committee drafted a substantially revised constitution. Elections were scheduled for December 2007. Many TRT politicians moved to the People's Power Party. The PPP won the December elections and nominated Samak Sundaravej as Premier.|$|E
25|$|In January 2010, The Guardian {{revealed}} the {{out of court}} payment to Goodman on grounds of settling an unfair dismissal case, and the later subsequent payment to Mulcaire. This started {{a new series of}} both newspaper stories, and subsequent further written questions from the Commons Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport, to both News International and <b>its</b> <b>executives.</b> In February 2010, The Guardian reported that three mobile phone companies had discovered that over a hundred of their customers had had their voicemails hacked. The companies identified the customers in 2007, after Scotland Yard disclosed numbers that had been accessed by Goodman and Mulcaire. A freedom of information request by The Guardian found that the police had recovered 91 PIN codes for accessing other people's voicemails in material seized from Mulcaire and Goodman. In April 2010, it was revealed from Crown Prosecution Service documents that although police had named only eight individuals in court, the Scotland Yard inquiry had actually uncovered over 4,000 names or partial names and nearly 3,000 full or partial telephone numbers from the materials seized from Mulcaire and Goodman.|$|E

On 30 December 2009, Xinhua reported continuing problems: powder and flavouring products sold by another company {{involved in the}} original scandal–the Shanghai Panda Dairy Company–were found to contain illegal levels of melamine; the dairy was closed and three of <b>its</b> <b>executives</b> arrested. On 25 January 2010, {{it was reported that}} three food companies from Hebei, Liaoning and Shandong provinces had produced melamine tainted products in March and April 2009 and that the three companies were banned from selling products in Guizhou. On 10 February 2010 China's state council announced a food safety commission, consisting of three vice premiers and a dozen minister-level officials, to address the nation's food regulatory problems. The group aims to improve government coordination and enforcement and to solve systemic food safety problems. As part of its ongoing effort to find and destroy any melamine-tainted milk remaining on the market, the Chinese government announced that it was recalling 170 tons of powdered milk laced with the industrial chemical which {{was supposed to have been}} destroyed or buried in 2008 but has recently found to have been repackaged and placed back into the marketplace.|$|E
