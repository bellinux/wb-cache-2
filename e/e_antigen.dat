The aim of the present study is to investigate the presence of E. histolytica by direct microscopic examination and ELISA in stool samples, comparatively. Materials and methods: Between September 2010 and May 2011, a total of 975 stool samples of patients in different age groups were sent to microbiology laboratory of Kızıltepe General Hospital. Native-Lugol method and <b>E.</b> histolytica-specific <b>antigen</b> test (Adhesin Ag, Entamoeba CELISA Path) was applied to all stool samples.

Goldfish retinal axons regenerate after optic nerve lesion (ONS) and express the L 1 -like cell adhesion protein <b>E</b> 587 <b>antigen</b> on their surfaces. Goldfish oligodendrocytes in vitro also produce <b>E</b> 587 <b>antigen</b> and promote growth of both fish and rat retinal axons. To determine whether glial cells in vivo synthesize <b>E</b> 587 <b>antigen,</b> in situ hybridizations with E 587 antisense cRNA probes and light- and electron microscopic E 587 immunostainings were carried out. After lesion, the goldfish optic nerve/tract contained glial cells expressing E 587 mRNA, which were few in number at 6 days after ONS, increased over the following week and declined in number thereafter. Also, E 587 -immunopositive elongated cells with ultrastructural characteristics of oligodendrocytes were found. Thus, glial cells synthe-size <b>E</b> 587 <b>antigen</b> in spatiotemporal correlation with retinal axon regeneration. To determine the functional contribution of <b>E</b> 587 <b>antigen,</b> axon-oligodendrocyte interac-tions were monitored in co-culture assays in the presence of Fab fragments of a polyclonal E 587 antiserum. E 587 Fabs in axon-glia co-cultures prevented the normal tight adhesion of goldfish retinal growth cones to oligodendrocytes and blocked the preferential growth of fish and rat retinal axons on the oligodendrocyte surfaces. The ability of glia in the goldfish visual pathway to upregulate the expression of <b>E</b> 587 <b>antigen</b> and the growth supportive effect of oligodendrocyte-associated <b>E</b> 587 <b>antigen</b> in vitro suggests that this L 1 -like adhesion protein promotes retinal axon regeneration i...|$|R

Results of the present experiments indicate that endothelial (<b>E)</b> <b>antigens</b> are different from previously known HLA antigens and also from Ia-like antigens of bone marrow-derived (B) lymphocytes. Attempts to absorb E antibodies with lymphocytes from E-positive donors failed in most cases. Antigen redistribution experiments showed that <b>E</b> <b>antigens</b> were located in separate molecules from the products of HLA-A, B, and C.

Antibodies to E cells were also cytotoxic for blood monocytes. Moreover, monocytes were able to absorb E-antibody reactions, indicating that similar antigens were expressed in both cells. E antibodies did not react with B lymphocytes isolated from peripheral blood. In that regard E antibodies were different from antibodies to human Ia-like antigens which reacted with E cells, monocytes, and isolated B lymphocytes.

40|$|SUMMARY In two renal {{dialysis}} units which had outbreaks of hepatitis B, patients were studied {{for the presence}} of <b>e</b> <b>antigen</b> and antibody. In one unit, in which the illness was mild and most of the patients (78 %) became carriers of HBsAg, all but one patient had <b>e</b> <b>antigen.</b> Most of the HBsAg carriers had persisting <b>e</b> <b>antigen</b> and most of the transient patients had also transient <b>e</b> <b>antigen.</b> In the other unit, in which the illness was more severe, none of the patients became a carrier. Only 30 % had <b>e</b> <b>antigen</b> during the acute phase of illness and 40 % developed anti-e just before clearing HBsAg. It seems possible that the differences between these two units may reflect strain differences in the infectivity of hepatitis B virus. The e antigen/antibody system was first described by Magnius and Espmark (1972), who suggested that the presence of <b>e</b> <b>antigen</b> might indicate infectivity while the antibody occurred only in non-infectious HBsAg positive sera. The correlation of <b>e</b> <b>antigen</b> with large numbers of 'Dane ' particles, and its absence in sera containing no 'Dane ' particles (Nielsen et al., 1974; Neurath et al., 1976), also seems to suggest a relationship to infectivity. Neurath et al. (1976) suggested that <b>e</b> <b>antigen</b> is present as an additional antigenic site {{on the surface of the}} 'Dane' particles and tubular forms of HBsAg as well as in the form of a soluble antigen. Nielsen et al. (1974) suggested that it might be a valuable prognostic marker because it was present in the sera of 58 % of cases of acute hepatitis B which progressed to chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis. In the present study, the presence was determined of <b>e</b> <b>antigen</b> and antibody in sera from patients in two {{renal dialysis}} units in which the outbreaks of hepatitis B (during 1969 - 71) were quite different (Polakoff et al., 1972).

It expresses D antigen but lacks C, c, <b>E</b> and <b>e</b> <b>antigens.</b> In D- - phenotype, the RHCE coding region is extensively modified by RHD sequence replacement, nucleotide deletion or splice-site changes. This article reports the identification of a new D- - haplotype in a Comorian man. It exhibits a hybrid gene in which RHCE gene exons 3 - 8 {{have been replaced by}} RHD sequences on the RHCE * C allele background. This allele is associated with no expression of c/C and e/E antigens and overexpression of RhD antige...|$|R
40|$|Human monocytic {{ehrlichiosis}} is a tick-borne {{infectious disease}} transmitted by several tick species, especially Amblyomma spp caused by Ehrlichia chaffeensis. E. chaffeensis is an obligatory intracel-lular, tick-transmitted bacterium that is maintained in nature in a cycle involving {{at least one}} and per-haps several vertebrate reservoir hosts. Two additional Ehrlichia spp, Anaplasma (formerly Ehrlichia) phagocytophila (the agent of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis [HGE]) and E. ewingii (a cause of granu-locytic ehrlichiosis in dogs) act as human pathogens. Human E. chaffeensis infections have generally been reported in North America, Asia and Europe, but recently human cases {{have been reported in}} Brazil only. Human monocytic ehrlichiosis is diagnosed by demonstration of a four-fold or greater change in antibody titer to <b>E.</b> chaffeensis <b>antigen</b> by IFA in paired serum samples, or a positive PCR assay and confirmation of E. chaffeensis DNA, or identification of morulae in leukocytes and a posi-tive IFA titer to <b>E.</b> chaffeensis <b>antigen,</b> or immunostaining of <b>E.</b> chaffeensis <b>antigen</b> in a biopsy or autopsy sample, or culture of E. chaffeensis from a clinical specimen. Key words Amblyomma spp – Ehrlichia chaffeensis – ehrlichiosis – human monocytic Ehrlichia chaffeensis is an obligatory intracellular...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{performance}} of polyclonal monospecific rabbit anti-sera raised against synthetic peptides derived from conserved HCV sequences of genotype 4 was evaluated for efficient detection of viral core and <b>E</b> 1 <b>antigens</b> in {{circulating immune complexes}} (ICs) precipitated from 65 serum samples of HCV patients. The infection was established in those patients {{by the presence of}} HCV RNA in their sera. A novel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed for the detection of HCV core and <b>E</b> 1 <b>antigen</b> in serum samples. Western blot analyses were used to demonstrate the presence of the core and <b>E</b> 1 target <b>antigen</b> in serum samples. The mean OD readings of both core and <b>E</b> 1 <b>antigens</b> were significantly higher (P < 0. 05) among the viremic patients when compared to controls. Also a significant positive correlation (P < 0. 05, r = 0. 98) between the values of both core and E 1 was recorded. Western blot analysis based on monospecific antibodies against core and E 1 recognized the 38 -kDa and 88 -kDa bands respectively in the sera of all infected patients. No specific reaction was observed with the sera from uninfected individuals. Interestingly the results of core and <b>E</b> 1 <b>antigen</b> levels displayed no positive correlation with the HCV copy number as measured by bDNA. Liver enzymes (ALT and AST) showed a moderate positive correlation (r = 0. 44 and 0. 47 respectively) with the viral core antigens level. The same trend holds true for E 1 (r = 0. 43 and 0. 64 for ALT and AST respectively). HCV load in infected patients revealed extremely poor correlation with serum ALT and AST levels (r = 0. 022 and 0. 002 respectively). In conclusion we present a new combination of serological tools correlating with liver enzyme levels that could be utilized as supplemental tests to viral load testing. Also, a sensitive and specific immunoassay was developed for the detection of HCV core and E 1 in human serum. This test can be applied for laboratory diagnosis of HCV infection. </p...|$|R
