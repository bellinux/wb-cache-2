[...] She successfully urged incorporation of tens of billions of dollars for renewable energy programs into the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.

[...] Environmentalists viewed her as a critical liaison to the White House.

500|$|The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 {{established}} a timetable and procedure for constructing a permanent, underground repository for {{high-level radioactive waste}} by the mid-1990s, and provided for some temporary storage of waste, including spent fuel from 104 civilian nuclear reactors that produce about 19.4% of electricity there. The United States in April 2008 had about 56,000 metric tons of spent fuel and 20,000 canisters of solid defense-related waste, and this {{is expected to increase}} to 119,000 metric tons by 2035. The U.S. opted for Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, a final repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada, but this project was widely opposed, with some of the main concerns being long distance transportation of waste from across the United States to this site, the possibility of accidents, and the uncertainty of success in isolating nuclear waste from the human environment in perpetuity. Yucca Mountain, with capacity for 70,000 metric tons of radioactive waste, was expected to open in 2017. However, the Obama Administration rejected use of the site in the 2009 United States Federal Budget proposal, which eliminated all funding except that needed to answer inquiries from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, [...] "while the Administration devises a new strategy toward nuclear waste disposal." [...] On March 5, 2009, <b>Energy</b> <b>Secretary</b> Steven Chu told a Senate hearing [...] "the Yucca Mountain site no longer was viewed as an option for storing reactor waste."

500|$|Harold Wilson {{resigned}} as Leader of the Labour Party and Prime Minister in March 1976. Benn later attributed {{the collapse of}} the Wilson government to cuts enforced on the UK by global capital, in particular the International Monetary Fund. In the resulting leadership contest Benn came in fourth out of the six cabinet ministers who stood – he withdrew as 11.8% of colleagues voted for him in the first ballot. Benn withdrew from the second ballot and supported Michael Foot; James Callaghan eventually won. Despite not receiving his support {{in the second and third}} rounds of the vote, Callaghan kept Benn on as <b>Energy</b> <b>Secretary.</b> In 1976 there was a sterling crisis, and Chancellor of the Exchequer Denis Healey sought a loan from the International Monetary Fund. [...] Underlining a wish to counter international market forces which seemed to penalise a larger welfare state, Benn publicly circulated the divided Cabinet minutes in which a narrow majority of the Labour Cabinet under Ramsay MacDonald supported a cut in unemployment benefits in order to obtain a loan from American bankers. As he highlighted, these minutes resulted in the 1931 split of the Labour Party in which MacDonald and his allies formed a National Government with Conservatives and Liberals. Callaghan allowed Benn to put forward the Alternative Economic Strategy, which consisted of a self-sufficient economy less dependent on low-rate fresh borrowing, but the AES, which according to opponents would have led to a [...] "siege economy", was rejected by the Cabinet. In response, Benn later recalled that: [...] "I retorted that their policy was a siege economy, only they had the bankers inside the castle with all our supporters left outside, whereas my policy would have our supporters in the castle with the bankers outside." [...] Benn blamed the Winter of Discontent on these cuts to socialist policies.|$|E
