5|$|Deleury {{suggests}} {{that although the}} temple may have {{been built in the}} 13th century, given the Hemadpanthi style architecture, the statue of Vithoba <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> earlier style so may have been carved for an earlier, smaller shrine that existed in Pandharpur. The workmanship of the image is earlier than the style of the Yadava (1175–1318), the Anhivad Chalukya (943–1210) and even the Ajmer Chohans (685–1193) eras. Although no other existing Vishnu temple has iconography like Pandharpur's Vithoba, Deleury finds similarities between the Pandharpur image and the third-century, arms-akimbo Vishnu images at Udaygiri Caves, Madhya Pradesh but declares that they are from different schools of sculpture.|$|E
5|$|The Church {{is built}} in the 13th century English Gothic style in coursed ragstone with a red-tiled roof and a central wooden belfry, topped by a splayed-foot spire and small dormers at the west end. The plan <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> aisle-less nave with a lower chancel, north chapel and south porch with a stair tower for the gallery (all at {{the west end of}} the church), with a sacristy linking it to the presbytery in the {{north-east}} corner. The windows are of Bath stone.|$|E
5|$|The first {{reliable}} {{report of}} Malcolm II's reign <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> invasion of Bernicia in 1006, perhaps the customary crech ríg (literally royal prey, a raid {{by a new}} king made to demonstrate prowess in war), which involved a siege of Durham. This appears to {{have resulted in a}} heavy defeat by the Northumbrians, led by Uhtred of Bamburgh, later Earl of Bernicia, which is reported by the Annals of Ulster.|$|E

5|$|To {{the same}} generic type belongs the famous abbots’ chair of Glastonbury; such chairs might readily {{be taken to}} pieces when their owners travelled. The faldisterium in time {{acquired}} arms and a back, while retaining its folding shape. The most famous, {{as well as the}} most, ancient, English chair is that made {{at the end of the}} 13th century for Edward I, in which most subsequent monarchs have been crowned. It <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> architectural type and of oak, and was covered with gilded gesso which long since disappeared.|$|E
5|$|Another theory {{found in}} colonial-era texts {{such as one}} by John Murraya missionary in British India and Jainism scholar, states the main image carved in Cave5 {{is that of a}} Jaina figure. According to a third theory, by Henry Cousens and A.Sundaraarchaeologists, and {{supported}} by local legends, the statue <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ancient king; in a photograph of the statue taken before its face was damaged, the figure lacked the Ushnisha lump that typically goes with Buddha's image. The statue has several unusual, non-Buddha ornaments such as rings for fingers, a necklace and a chest-band; it wears a Hindu Yajnopavita thread and its head is stylistically closer to a Jina head than a Buddha head. These features suggest the statue may be of a king represented with features of various traditions. According to Carol Radcliffe BolonAssistant Curator at the Smithsonian Freer Gallery of Art, the date and identity of the main statue in Cave5 remains enigmatic.|$|E
5|$|Clifford's Tower <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unusual design. The two-storey tower has a quatrefoil {{plan with}} four {{circular}} lobes. Each lobe measures 22 feet (6.5 metres) across, with walls 9 feet 6inches (3 metres) thick; at its widest, the tower is 79 feet (24 metres) across. A square gatehouse, 21 feet (6.5 metres) wide, protected the entrance {{on the south}} side between two of the lobes. There are defensive turrets between the other lobes. Large corbels and a central pier supported the huge weight of stone and the first floor. Loopholes of a design unique to York Castle provided firing points. A chapel was built over the entrance, measuring 15 feet by 14 feet (4.5 metres by 4.2 metres), doubling as a portcullis chamber as at Harlech and Chepstow Castles. The tower is believed to be an experiment in improving flanking fire by making more ground visible from the summit of the keep. Although unique to England, the design of the tower closely resembles that at Étampes in France, and may have influenced the design of the future keep of Pontefract Castle. Henry employed master mason Henry de Rayns and chief carpenter Simon of Northampton for the project, and the cost of the tower accounted {{for the majority of the}} overall expenditure on the castle during this period of work.|$|E

5|$|II. Andantino in F-sharp minor, A–B–A form. The A section {{presents}} a sparse, lamenting, poignant melody, full of sighing gestures (portrayed by descending seconds). This theme, despite its vastly different character, references the opening {{bars of the}} Allegro, an aforementioned source {{of much of the}} sonata's material – the Andantino's first measure shares with the fanfare a second-beat bass note 'echo' after the downbeat on A, creating an audible rhythmic affinity; additionally, the quiet close of the A theme features the fanfare's characteristic pattern of stepwise thirds in the middle voices enclosed between tonic octaves. The middle section <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> improvisatory, fantasia-like character, with extremely harsh modulations and sonorities, culminating in C-sharp minor with fortissimo chords. The chromaticism, triplet emphasis, and modulatory patterns of this section are all reminiscent of the developments nested within the Allegro's exposition. After the C-sharp minor climax (according to Fisk, a key of great importance in the cycle due to its relation to Der Wanderer), a recitative section with startling sforzando outbursts emphasizing an ascending minor second leads to a serene phrase in the major mode (C-sharp major), which in turn leads (as the dominant of F-sharp minor) back to the A section, here somewhat transformed, with new accompanimental figuration. The final bars of the movement feature rolled chords that prefigure the opening of the following Scherzo.|$|E
5|$|The picture {{painted by}} the few and {{scattered}} {{references to the}} Cretan emirate from the Muslim world, on the other hand, <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ordered state with a regular monetary economy and extensive trade links, and {{there is evidence that}} Chandax was a cultural centre of some importance. The survival of numerous gold, silver, and copper coins, of almost constant weight and composition, testifies to a strong economy and a high living standard among the population. The economy was strengthened by extensive trade {{with the rest of the}} Muslim world, especially with Egypt, and by a booming agriculture: the need to sustain an independent state, as well as access to the markets of the Muslim world, led to an intensification of cultivation. It is also possible that sugar cane was introduced to Crete at the time.|$|E

25|$|The {{traditionally}} accepted {{identification of}} the model is of Rembrandt's partner Hendrickje Stoffels, {{who would have been}} 28 {{at the time of the}} painting. Sluijter has proposed otherwise, stating that the likeness <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ideal type used by Rembrandt over a long period. Assuming Stoffels as the model, medical researchers have observed deformity in the left breast, and have offered various hypotheses including breast cancer, abscess due to tuberculosis and lactation mastitis following an unsuccessful pregnancy. The diagnosis of breast cancer is unlikely, given that Stoffels lived for another nine years.|$|E

25|$|Leavenworth Nutcracker Museum is {{a museum}} {{dedicated}} to nutcrackers, located in Leavenworth, Washington. Founded by Arlene Wagner {{and her husband}} George in 1995, the museum housed over 6,000 nutcrackers in 2010. Wagner studied ballet under Alexandra Danilova, and subsequently became a ballet instructor. She taught multiple productions of The Nutcracker, and became enamored of nutcrackers. She began collecting them during the 1960s. The museum's building is of a Bavarian style and <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> area of 3,000 square feet; it is situated above Wagner's shop Nussknacker Haus, which sells nutcrackers.|$|E

During peacetime, they feel to be the king's equals but during wars they obey him blindly or whoever among them that he considers to be the most skillful. If the fortunes of war are against them they pray to one of their many gods (Æsir) and if they win they are grateful to him.|$|E

25|$|This design philosophy, {{common in}} Britain and France (and, after 1941, the United States) tended towards {{eliminating}} fuselage mounted guns altogether. For example, the original 1934 specifications for the Hawker Hurricane were {{for a similar}} armament to the Gloster Gladiator: four machine-guns, two in the wings and two in the fuselage, synchronized to fire through the propeller arc. The illustration opposite <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> early mock-up of the prototype, showing the starboard fuselage gun. The prototype (K5083) as completed had ballast representing this armament; production Hurricane Is, however, were armed with eight guns, all in the wings.|$|E
25|$|As well {{as being}} great navigators, these people were artists and {{artisans}} of great skill. Simple objects, such as fish-hooks would be manufactured to exacting standards for different catches and decorated even when the decoration {{was not part of}} the function. Stone and wooden weapons were considered to be more powerful the better they were made and decorated. In some island groups weaving was a strong part of the culture and gifting woven articles was an ingrained practice. Dwellings were imbued with character by the skill of their building.
