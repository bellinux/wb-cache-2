In 1990, she wrote an autobiography, titled Be My Baby: How <b>I</b> <b>Survived</b> Mascara, Miniskirts, and Madness, in which she offers a damning verdict of her only Apple single. The song [...] "stunk", she admits in the book, and its meaning was lost on her. [...] "Religion? Drugs? Sex? I was mystified," [...] Spector writes. [...] "And the more George sang, the more mystified I got." [...] In light of this statement, Dale Allison opines of her performance on the 1971 recording: [...] "she didn't understand the song at all and sang it accordingly." [...] Reviewing the Come and Get It compilation for BBC Music, Mike Diver commented on the overindulgence behind many of the Beatles' Apple projects but viewed Spector's [...] "Try Some, Buy Some" [...] as being [...] "worthy of praise".|$|E
