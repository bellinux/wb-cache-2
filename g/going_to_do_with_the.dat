500|$|By this time, Nixon {{campaign}} headquarters was receiving {{a flood of}} messages, calling on the senator to resign from the ticket. When Eisenhower's train stopped for the candidate to make speeches, he faced protesters with signs reading [...] "Donate Here to Help Poor Richard Nixon". The influential Washington Post and New York Herald-Tribune both called for Nixon to leave the ticket, facts which Chotiner did not tell his candidate; [...] Nixon learned them from a questioning reporter. Over 100 newspapers would editorialize about the Fund {{on the morning of}} September 20, opinion running two to one against Nixon. As his train stopped in Eugene, Oregon, Nixon was met with protestors signs referencing his wife: [...] "Pat, What Are You <b>Going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> <b>With</b> <b>the</b> Bribe Money?" [...] and [...] "No Mink Coats for Nixon—Just Cold Cash". He angrily responded with a phrase which would be echoed in the Checkers speech. After stating that there were no mink coats for the Nixons, the candidate said that he was [...] "proud of the fact that Pat Nixon wears a good Republican cloth coat, and she's going to continue to." ...|$|E
500|$|With {{the club}} failing {{to live up}} to its high {{spending}} potential, Ford became a target for doubters due to his physical playing style and his arguments with teammate and former record-breaking signing, Len Shackleton. During a match against Chelsea in February 1952, Ford scored a first-half hat-trick during the match as the Mackems found themselves 4–0 up at half-time, Shackleton having also scored. In the second- half of the match, Shackleton was believed to have [...] "switched off" [...] as he considered the match already won, leaving Ford to largely play up-front on his own against the opposition defense, resulting in a frustrated Ford to claim to members of the local press after the game that Shackleton never deliberately passed to him during games. Things became so heated between the pair that, during a friendly match against a Netherlands B side, Shackleton dribbled past the opposition goalkeeper before stopping on the goal-line and passing the ball back to Ford before commenting [...] "Here, don't say I never give you a pass" [...] in reference to Ford's displeasure at his belief that Shackleton would play the ball in areas Ford did not want it. Billy Bingham, who played alongside the pair at Sunderland, later commented [...] "He (Ford) never seemed to know what Shackleton was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ball and subsequently Trevor believed that Shackleton was ignoring him on the field of play". Stan Anderson, another former teammate of the pair, believed that Shackleton was jealous of Ford's perceived good looks and also supported Ford's claims of Shackleton deliberately misplacing passes to Ford on at least one occasion, commenting [...] "I just had the feeling he (Shackleton) never wanted Trevor to score, which made me really angry".|$|E

Partly {{that was done}} to tell an original Puss story, but partly because we didn't know what Shrek 4 were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> characters and we couldn't write conflicting storylines." [...] The film was teased in Shrek Forever After, when Shrek finally shuts the book titled [...] "Shrek", and puts it away next to a book titled [...] "Puss in Boots".|$|E

2500|$|Party {{insiders}} {{suggested that}} Ignatieff {{would have to}} secure at least 35% of the delegates elected on [...] "Super Weekend" [...] to avoid being overtaken in subsequent ballots. Although he won the most delegates overall on that weekend, he did not reach the 35% target. An anonymous source speculated to the BBC that Ignatieff's 30-year absence from Canada and his initial support for the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq played against him in the election. Patrick Gossage, a Toronto political consultant and Ignatieff supporter, explained his eventual loss this way: [...] "There were people saying, 'Who is this telling us what he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> party?' Even though he {{was supported by the}} party establishment he nevertheless was an outsider, and he never successfully dealt with the labels the media put on him that he'd been away for 30 years." [...] Lauren P. S. Epstein, the former prime minister of the Harvard Canadian Club, said: “What it came down to in the final vote was that the Liberal delegates were looking for someone who was more likely to unite the party; Ignatieff had ardent supporters, but at the same time, he had people who would never under any circumstances support him.” Running second in many polls but with strong second choice support, Bob Rae looked like the most likely candidate to capitalize on Ignatieff's second ballot weakness. However, critics cited Rae's turbulent tenure as Ontario Premier in the early to mid 1990s, arguing that electoral success in Ontario was essential for forming government.|$|E
