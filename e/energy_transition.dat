40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to better understand the local <b>energy</b> <b>transitions</b> process, given the importance of local <b>energy</b> <b>transitions.</b> A systematic literature search was conducted and 18 core and 18 peripheral papers on local <b>energy</b> <b>transitions</b> were selected. The 18 core papers were assessed using the framework given by Turnheim et. al. [1]. Findings show that local <b>energy</b> <b>transitions</b> have characteristics or features which are not adequately explained by the framework used. Sources of innovation and the innovation in niches in local <b>energy</b> <b>transitions</b> are explained by socio-technical theories such as Strategic Niche Management (SNM) and Multi-Level Perspective (MLP). The pathway dynamics and the normative goals are covered by quantitative modeling studies of local <b>energy</b> <b>transitions.</b> The specific features of local <b>energy</b> <b>transitions</b> which are not adequately analysed by the existing framework are ownerships of transitions, situative governance issues, spatial scale issues, differing priorities and differing institutional structures, along with the analysis of pathway dynamics. A suggestion for extending a framework to analyse local <b>energy</b> <b>transitions</b> is proposed...|$|R
40|$|The {{relatively}} rare and protracted nature of <b>energy</b> <b>transitions</b> implies {{that it is}} vital to look at historical experiences for lessons about how they might unfold in the future. The fastest historical sector-specific <b>energy</b> <b>transitions</b> observed here was thirty years. However, full <b>energy</b> <b>transitions,</b> involving all sectors and services, have taken much longer. Ultimately, the price of energy services {{played a crucial role in}} creating the incentives to stimulate <b>energy</b> <b>transitions,</b> but <b>energy</b> price shocks may have acted as a catalyst for stimulating processes that led to certain <b>energy</b> <b>transitions.</b> An additional key factor is whether the new technology offers new characteristics of value to the consumer, which can help create a market even when the initial price is higher. A crucial factor that can delay a transition is the reaction of the incumbent and declining industries. Nevertheless, governments have, in a few instances, created the institutional setting to stimulate <b>energy</b> <b>transitions</b> to low-polluting <b>energy</b> sources, and this could be done again, if the political will and alternative energy sources were available. Finally, past <b>energy</b> <b>transitions</b> have had major impacts on the incumbent industries which have declined, on economic transformations and on inequality...|$|R

40|$|Economic development, {{technological}} innovation, {{and policy}} change are especially prominent factors shaping <b>energy</b> <b>transitions.</b> Therefore explaining <b>energy</b> <b>transitions</b> requires combining insights from disciplines investigating these factors. The existing literature {{is not consistent}} in identifying these disciplines nor proposing {{how they can be}} combined. We conceptualize national <b>energy</b> <b>transitions</b> as a co-evolution of three types of systems: energy flows and markets, energy technologies, and energy-related policies. The focus on the three types of systems gives rise to three perspectives on national energy transitions: techno-economic with its roots in energy systems analysis and various domains of economics; socio-technical with its roots in sociology of technology, STS, and evolutionary economics; and political with its roots in political science. We use the three perspectives as an organizing principle to propose a meta-theoretical framework for analyzing national <b>energy</b> <b>transitions.</b> Following Elinor Ostrom's approach, the proposed framework explains national <b>energy</b> <b>transitions</b> through a nested conceptual map of variables and theories. In comparison with the existing meta-theoretical literature, the three perspectives framework elevates the role of political science since policies are likely to be increasingly prominent in shaping 21 st century <b>energy</b> <b>transitions...</b>|$|R

25|$|Initially, {{the system}} of atoms is at thermal equilibrium, and the {{majority}} of the atoms will be in the ground state, i.e., N1 ≈ N, N2 ≈ N3 ≈ 0. If we now subject the atoms to light of a frequency , the process of optical absorption will excite electrons from the ground state to level 3. This process is called pumping, and does not necessarily always directly involve light absorption; other methods of exciting the laser medium, such as electrical discharge or chemical reactions, may be used. The level 3 is sometimes referred to as the pump level or pump band, and the <b>energy</b> <b>transition</b> E1 → E3 as the pump transition, which is shown as the arrow marked P in the diagram on the right.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Energy</b> <b>transition</b> is {{the shift}} by several {{countries}} to sustainable economies {{by means of}} renewable energy, energy efficiency and sustainable development. This trend has been augmented by the decentralization process of energy generation which is starting to allow average homeowners and small companies to generate their own electricity, allowing everyone to install solar panels on their rooftops and, in many markets, sell their excess electricity back on to the grid. This trend continues to grow and could in the future lead to a majority of our energy coming from decentralized solar panels and wind turbines scattered across the country rather {{than a handful of}} coal and nuclear power plants. The final goal of German proponents of a nuclear power phase-out is the abolishment of coal and other non-renewable energy sources.|$|E
25|$|MRI was {{originally}} called 'NMRI' (nuclear magnetic resonance imaging). It {{is based upon}} the science of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Certain atomic nuclei are able to absorb and emit radio frequency energy when placed in an external magnetic field. In clinical and research MRI, hydrogen atoms are most often used to generate a detectable radio-frequency signal that is received by antennas in close proximity to the anatomy being examined. Hydrogen atoms exist naturally in people and other biological organisms in abundance, particularly in water and fat. For this reason, most MRI scans essentially map the location of water and fat in the body. Pulses of radio waves excite the nuclear spin <b>energy</b> <b>transition,</b> and magnetic field gradients localize the signal in space. By varying the parameters of the pulse sequence, different contrasts may be generated between tissues based on the relaxation properties of the hydrogen atoms therein.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTransitioning {{away from}} our current global energy system is of {{paramount}} importance. The speed at which a transition can take place—its timing, or temporal dynamics—is a critical element of consideration. This study therefore investigates the issue of time in global and national <b>energy</b> <b>transitions</b> by asking: What does the mainstream academic literature suggest about the time scale of <b>energy</b> <b>transitions?</b> Additionally, what does {{some of the more}} recent empirical data related to transitions say, or challenge, about conventional views? In answering these questions, the article presents a “mainstream” view of <b>energy</b> <b>transitions</b> as long, protracted affairs, often taking decades to centuries to occur. However, the article then offers some empirical evidence that the predominant view of timing may not always be supported by the evidence. With this in mind, the final part of the article argues for more transparent conceptions and definitions of <b>energy</b> <b>transitions,</b> and it asks for analysis that recognizes the causal complexity underlying them...|$|R

40|$|While the {{traditional}} form of electricity generation and supply {{is based on}} centralized structures with large-scale power plants, the objective of a strongly decentralized form of energy supply is increasingly becoming important. Sustainability-oriented <b>energy</b> <b>transitions</b> are relying on various sorts of renewable energies coupled with energy-efficiency initiatives. In the current existing regulatory and market frameworks in Germany and elsewhere, important technical and institutional innovations for <b>energy</b> <b>transitions</b> were and are being developed, tested, and brought to application on regional and local levels. Regions, cities, and villages experimenting with socio-technical innovations and aiming to implement new concepts have to develop governance structures under high uncertainty. These governance structures mirror space-specific social, political, technological and economic constellations. The present article introduces an analytical approach for studying emergent forms of governance and uses four cases from Germany to apply the approach. Research {{is based on a}} comparative case study research design, using primarily expert interviews and document analyses as data sources. The cases demonstrate that sustainable <b>energy</b> <b>transitions</b> are driven forward by a host of different actors with different aims and interests, culminating in the development of space-specific technological mixes and situative governance structures. Sustainable <b>energy</b> <b>transitions</b> neither follow a master plan, nor are they coordinated on a national level. The upper political levels and external events pose severe constraints for the implementation of local transition initiatives. Future research should aim to highlight and analyze the contentious character of <b>energy</b> <b>transitions...</b>|$|R

Switzerland has abandoned plans to replace its old nuclear reactors and will take the last one offline in 2034. Anti-nuclear opposition intensified in Germany. In the following months the government decided to shut down eight reactors immediately (August 6, 2011) {{and to have the}} other nine off the grid by the end of 2022. Renewable energy in Germany is believed to be able to compensate for much of the loss. In September 2011 Siemens, which had been responsible for constructing all 17 of Germany's existing nuclear power plants, announced that it would exit the nuclear sector following the Fukushima disaster and the subsequent changes to German energy policy.

2500|$|Gamma {{spectroscopy}} is {{the study}} of the energetic transitions in atomic nuclei, which are generally associated with the absorption or emission of gamma rays. As in optical spectroscopy (see Franck Condon effect) the absorption of gamma rays by a nucleus is especially likely (i.e., peaks in a [...] "resonance") when the energy of the gamma ray is {{the same as that of}} an <b>energy</b> <b>transition</b> in the nucleus. In the case of gamma rays, such a resonance is seen in the technique of Mössbauer spectroscopy. In the Mössbauer effect the narrow resonance absorption for nuclear gamma absorption can be successfully attained by physically immobilizing atomic nuclei in a crystal. The immobilization of nuclei at both ends of a gamma resonance interaction is required so that no gamma energy is lost to the kinetic energy of recoiling nuclei at either the emitting or absorbing end of a gamma transition. Such loss of energy causes gamma ray resonance absorption to fail. However, when emitted gamma rays carry essentially all of the energy of the atomic nuclear de-excitation that produces them, this energy is also sufficient to excite the same energy state in a second immobilized nucleus of the same type.|$|E
