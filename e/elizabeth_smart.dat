Later, In the Meantime (1984), a collection of Smart's unpublished poetry and prose appeared, and her two volumes of journals, Necessary Secrets: The Journals of <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>Smart</b> (1986) were published posthumously.|$|E
25|$|During the 2002 <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>Smart</b> {{kidnapping}} case, when suspect Richard Ricci {{was arrested}} by police {{on the basis that}} he had a criminal record and had worked on the Smarts' home, Grace immediately and repeatedly proclaimed on Court TV and CNN's Larry King Live that Ricci was guilty, although there was little evidence to support this claim. She also suggested publicly that Ricci's girlfriend was involved in the cover-up of his alleged crime. Grace continued to accuse Ricci, though he died while in custody. It was later revealed that Smart was kidnapped by Brian David Mitchell and Wanda Barzee, two individuals with whom Ricci had no connection.|$|E

500|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} Dugard's return, Carl Probyn, her stepfather, confirmed that Dugard and her daughters were in good health and intelligent; their reunion was going well; and they were proceeding slowly. He said his stepdaughter had developed a significant emotional bond with Garrido, and the two daughters cried when they learned of their father's arrest. Dugard's aunt, Tina Dugard, said Dugard's daughters are clever, articulate, curious girls who have a bright future ahead of them. Ernie Allen, president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, said Dugard's reappearance is an important event for families of other long-term missing children, because it shows that there is hope even in long-term cases. Notable abduction survivor <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>Smart</b> has {{stressed the importance of}} focusing on the future with a positive attitude as an effective approach to accepting what has happened. Shawn Hornbeck, another abduction survivor, also commented on the case, noting: [...] "Coming out of what she's had to endure is like entering a new world. It's like a door has opened for her and she's emerged from a world that's black and white into one that's full of color." [...] He opined that she was brainwashed, would feel angry and now needs to move on with her life.|$|E

40|$|This study {{argues for}} the {{influence}} of Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophy on <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>Smart's</b> novel, By Grand Central Station I Sat Down and Wept. Following Goran Hermeren's guidelines for an influence argument, I argue the case for Smart's contact with Nietzsche's work, similarities between his work and Smart's novel, {{and the effect of}} his work on Smart's novel. Nietzsche's conception of tragedy applies to and describes the novel surprisingly well, explaining certain similarities between the authors' works while identifying another of the text's many genres. The argument is largely based on circumstantial evidence, but its cumulative force is highly suggestive of a hitherto unrecognized philosophical complexity in Smart's novel...|$|R

2500|$|In a 2011 New York Times article, David Carr wrote, [...] "Since {{her show}} began in 2005, the {{presumption}} of innocence has found a willful enemy in the former prosecutor turned broadcast judge-and-jury". He criticized her handling of the kidnapping of <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>Smart,</b> the Duke lacrosse case, the Melinda Duckett interview and suicide and the Caylee Anthony case. George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley told Carr that Grace, as an attorney and reporter, [...] "has managed to demean both professions with her hype, rabid persona, and sensational analysis. Some part of the public takes her seriously, and her show erodes the respect for basic rights." ...|$|E
2500|$|Traditionally, he is {{associated}} with the [...] "Harry" [...] who appears in the cast list for Richard Tarlton's The Seven Deadly Sins, but this identification is little more than conjecture. If the connection is true, then Condell was an actor as early as 1590, acting in Lord Strange's Men alongside John Heminges and Augustine Phillips. Condell was definitely in London by 24 October 1596, when he married, at St Laurence Pountney, <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>Smart</b> (d.1635), the only child of John Smart of the Strand, gentleman. They settled in St Mary Aldermanbury, the parish in which Heminges lived. Condell, like Heminges, served as churchwarden in that church. Nine children were baptized there, born between 1599 and 1614, of whom only three survived to adulthood: Elizabeth (baptized 26 October 1606), who married Herbert Finch; Henry (baptized 6 May 1610, died 1630); and William (baptized 26 May 1611).|$|E
40|$|This article {{reflects}} upon <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>Smart's</b> prose work By Grand Central Station I Sat Down and Wept. This text {{is frequently}} condemned because it places the author's sexual passion {{in opposition to}} the tragic events of the Second World War and proclaims that the passion overwhelms the pain; â€˜love is as strong as deathâ€™. It is argued that rather than constructing a romantic retreat from the horrors of war Smart is making a radical response to the conflict. She places the trope of the desiring and fertile female body in powerful opposition to the disembodied ethical and spiritual systems which are implicated in the crises of her times. Furthermore, similar devices are frequently, if unreflectively, used by feminist academics who, following Luce Irigaray, employ the female morphology to oppose the violence of our own times...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{starts from}} college teachersâ€™ {{frequent}} recognition that pedagogic materials, in â€˜language through literatureâ€™ {{as in many}} other fields, often work best when designed with a particular group (or at least kind) of student in mind, and with sensitivity to linguistic, cultural and other factors which characterise a given teaching situation. Despite widespread acknowledgement of the value in targeting materials this way, however, not much importance is given in teacher-development or during in-service training to understanding how workshop materials can be devised rather than merely used. This chapter considers aspects of groupwork-materials design including: choice of passage; devising tasks; implementing the activity in a classroom session; and evaluating the learning which takes place. Discussion is organised around an activity (based on <b>Elizabeth</b> <b>Smartâ€™s</b> 'By Grand Central Station I Sat Down and Wept', 1945) which was devised by the author for a given occasion. Participants' responses, when the activity was tested in two experimental classes, are reported...|$|R
