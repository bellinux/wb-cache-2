In that case, as indeed in most power systems, power density is an important characteristic. Doubling power density at least halves the cost of electricity. In addition, the confinement time required depends on the power density.|$|E

25|$|Hybrid {{nuclear power}} is a {{proposed}} means of generating power by use {{of a combination of}} nuclear fusion and fission processes. The concept dates to the 1950s, and was briefly advocated by Hans Bethe during the 1970s, but largely remained unexplored until a revival of interest in 2009, due to delays in the realization of pure fusion. When a sustained nuclear <b>fusion</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> is built, {{it has the potential to}} be capable of extracting all the fission energy that remains in spent fission fuel, reducing the volume of nuclear waste by orders of magnitude, and more importantly, eliminating all actinides present in the spent fuel, substances which cause security concerns.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} many claims about the {{capabilities}} of helium-3 power plants. According to proponents, fusion power plants operating on deuterium and helium-3 would offer lower capital and operating costs than their competitors due to less technical complexity, higher conversion efficiency, smaller size, the absence of radioactive fuel, no air or water pollution, and only low-level radioactive waste disposal requirements. Recent estimates suggest that about $6 billion in investment capital {{will be required to}} develop and construct the first helium-3 <b>fusion</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant.</b> Financial breakeven at today's wholesale electricity prices (5 US cents per kilowatt-hour) would occur after five 1-gigawatt plants were on line, replacing old conventional plants or meeting new demand.|$|E

25|$|Bussard asserted, {{by using}} {{superconductor}} coils, {{that the only}} significant energy loss channel is through electron losses proportional to the surface area. He also stated that the density would scale with {{the square of the}} field (constant beta conditions), and the maximum attainable magnetic field would scale with the radius. Under those conditions, the fusion power produced would scale with the seventh power of the radius, and the energy gain would scale with the fifth power. While Bussard did not publicly document the reasoning underlying this estimate, scaling results from multiplying the fusion power density (proportional to density squared, or B4) with the volume (proportional toR³). On the other hand, if it is important to maintain the ratio of the Debye length or the gyroradius to the machine size, then the magnetic field strength would have to scale inversely with the radius, so that the total power output would actually be lower in a larger machine. if true, it would enable a model only ten times larger to be useful as a <b>fusion</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant.</b>|$|E
