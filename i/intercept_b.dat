5000|$|Allometric {{engineering}} {{is the process}} of experimentally shifting the scaling relationships, for body size or shape, in a population of organisms. More specifically, the process of experimentally breaking the tight covariance evident among component traits of a complex phenotype by altering the variance of one trait relative to another. Typically, body size is one of the two traits. The measurements of the two traits are plotted against each other and the scaling relationship can be represented as: [...] Manipulations of this sort alter the scaling relationships either by shifting the <b>intercept</b> (<b>b),</b> slope (m) or both to create novel variants (see: Allometry, for more details). These novel variants can then be tested for differences in performance or fitness. Through careful testing, one could sequentially test each component of a trait suite to determine how each part contributes to the function of the entire complex phenotype, and ultimately the fitness of the organism. This technique allows for comparison within or among biological groups differing in size by adjusting morphology to match one another and comparing their performances.|$|E

In this paper we propose a novel approach to optimize these parameters without making use of any assumption about the distributions and estimate them efficiently from the training data. We evaluated our performance on 11 TREC topics for which best results submitted to the TREC 11 batch filtering track obtained recalls of less than 50 %, with an average of 29 %.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to find a {{procedure}} allowing estimation of individual pharmacokinetic parameters for adriamycin with minimal cost and disturbance for the patient. Twenty-five patients with breast cancer were treated by short infusion of adriamycin at a dose of 12 mg m- 2 week- 1 (41 courses). Population characteristics were determined on 15 randomly chosen courses (10 patients, group I) in order to define two optimal sampling times (26 min and 24 h) and to perform Bayesian estimation on the remaining 26 courses (17 patients, group II). For patients of group II, Bayesian estimation (BE) associated with a reduced sub-optimal sampling protocol (20 min and 24 h) was compared with maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), the classical procedure. Regression analysis of clearance values obtained after BE versus MLE indicated a high correlation coefficient (r = 0. 969) with the slope (a = 0. 991 +/- 0. 085) and the <b>intercept</b> (<b>b</b> = 2. 271 +/- 4. 810) close to 1 and 0 respectively.

An example is given of its use for the calculation of glucose concentration. The nomogram is sufficiently accurate for clinical use, and can be rapidly used. NOMOGRAMS ARE used regularly in our laboratory for various routine calculations (1). A frequent calculation, which may be performed rapidly with the nomogram presented here, is typified by the colorimetric deter-mination of glucose concentration with a reaction in which absorbance decreases as glucose concentration increases (Figure 1). The system uses an AutoAnalyzer and depends upon the reduction of yellow ferricyanide to colorless ferrocyanide (2). The linear relationship between glucose concentra-tion (x) and absorbance (y) may be expressed by the equation y = mx + b where m is the slope (negative in this case) and b is the <b>intercept</b> (<b>b</b> is the absorbance {{in the absence of}} glucose).

The electrical resistivity between 5 and 300 K in the fully ferromagnetic state, obtained by applying a field beyond the saturation field (H_sat) necessary for the antiferromagnetic(AF) -ferromagnetic(FM) field-induced transition, shows evidence of spin-disorder resistivity as in crystalline Fe and an s-d scattering contribution (as in 3 d metals and alloys). The sublattice magnetization m(T) in these multilayers has been calculated {{in terms of the}} planar and interlayer exchange energies. The additional spin-dependent scattering Δρ (T) = ρ(T,H= 0) _AF - ρ(T,H=H_sat) _FM in the AF state over a wide range of temperature is found to be proportional to the sublattice magnetization, both Δρ(T) and m(T) reducing along with the antiferromagnetic fraction. At intermediate fields, the spin-dependent part of the electrical resistivity (ρ_s (T)) fits well to the power law ρ_s (T) = b - cT^α where c is a constant and b and α are functions of H.

Then GPL density proles are compared with simulated dark haloes (SDH) density proles, and nonlinear least-absolute val-ues and least-squares ts involving the above mentioned ve parameters (RFSM 5 method) are prescribed. More specically, the sum of absolute values or squares of absolute logarithmic residuals, Ri = log SDH(ri) log GPL(ri), is evaluated on 105 points making a 5 -dimension hypergrid, through a few iterations. The size is progressively reduced around a ducial minimum, and superpositions on nodes of earlier hypergrids are avoided. An application is made to a sample of 17 SDHs on the scale of cluster of galaxies, within a at CDM cosmological model (Rasia et al. 2004). In dealing with the mean SDH density prole, a virial radius, rvir, averaged over the whole sample, is assigned, which allows the calculation of the remaining parameters.
