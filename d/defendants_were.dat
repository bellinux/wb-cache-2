5|$|On Tuesday 18 June {{the court}} opened at 9am; 12 <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> charged with {{breaking}} into the house of Rebecca Waddelow in Littleport and stealing personal property and money. After hearing evidence, the judges held a discussion. Mr Justice Abbott informed the jury that a mistake {{had been made in}} the indictment, directing the jury to acquit. All 12 <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> pronounced not guilty.|$|E
5|$|Five <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> then {{indicted for}} forcing {{their way in}} the house of Rev. John Vachell in Littleport, {{threatening}} him and stealing £2. Mr Gurney addressed the jury. Two witnesses testified. A verdict of guilty was returned against Harley and Newell whilst Warner and Stibbard were acquitted.|$|E
5|$|On 2 December 1987, both <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> {{sentenced to}} life imprisonment, with a {{recommendation}} that Mattei should serve no less than 18 years in prison. Frugoli's sentence was subsequently reduced to 20 years in prison. Their accomplices in the attack were never identified.|$|E
2500|$|... (a) A <b>{{defendant}}</b> <b>is</b> {{guilty of}} a Class B1 felony if the defendant engages in vaginal intercourse or a sexual act with another person who is 13, 14, or 15 years old and the <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> at least six years older than the person, except when the <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> lawfully married to the person.|$|R
50|$|Gender {{discrimination}} {{also helps}} explain the differences between trial outcomes in which some female <b>defendants</b> <b>are</b> sentenced to death and other female <b>defendants</b> <b>are</b> sentenced to lesser punishments. Phillip Barron argues that female <b>defendants</b> <b>are</b> {{more likely to be}} sentenced to death for crimes that violate gender norms, such as killing children or killing strangers.|$|R
5000|$|... (a) A <b>{{defendant}}</b> <b>is</b> {{guilty of}} a Class B1 felony if the defendant engages in vaginal intercourse or a sexual act with another person who is 13, 14, or 15 years old and the <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> at least six years older than the person, except when the <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> lawfully married to the person.|$|R
5|$|The {{case was}} appealed in 1887 to the Supreme Court of Illinois, {{then to the}} United States Supreme Court where the <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> {{represented}} by John Randolph Tucker, Roger Atkinson Pryor, General Benjamin F. Butler and William P. Black. The petition for certiorari was denied.|$|E
5|$|The <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> {{scheduled}} to be retried by civilian courts after widespread international criticism. The prosecutor's office stated that the defendants' confessions, which had allegedly been given under torture, would {{not be used as}} evidence.|$|E
5|$|The <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> {{subject to}} fines {{of up to}} $100,000 per {{violation}} of the Spyware Act and $2,000 per violation of the Consumer Protection Act if found liable. They were also subject to paying restitution to affected consumers.|$|E
50|$|If a {{criminal}} case is brought to trial and the <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> acquitted, jeopardy {{is attached to the}} case and it can never be retried. If the <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> convicted and his conviction is overturned, jeopardy is not attached because the <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> considered to simply be in the same state they were before the case was tried.|$|R
5000|$|... (b) A <b>{{defendant}}</b> <b>is</b> {{guilty of}} a Class C felony if the defendant engages in vaginal intercourse or a sexual act with another person who is 13, 14, or 15 years old and the <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> more than four but less than six years older than the person, except when the <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> lawfully married to the person.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{exception}} to {{a ban on}} retrying a <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> if, in a trial, the defendant bribed the judge into acquitting him or her, since the <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> not in jeopardy ...|$|R
5|$|Townsend was arraigned on 20 August, but {{strongly}} {{questioned the}} view that his writings were subversive {{as well as the}} legal foundations of the charges. Along with the other defendants, Townsend was as before strongly defended by senators with anti-interventionist sympathies, including Gerald Nye who said the <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> no more guilty of sedition than he had been for speaking out against intervening in the war. In fact there were from the beginning many concerns even within the US government about the validity of the proceedings and their constitutionality as no clear evidence had yet been uncovered to demonstrate that the <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> in collusion with Nazi Germany or with each other.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed at {{the popular}} appeal of Paine's Rights of Man, the king issued a {{proclamation}} against seditious writings in May 1792. Booksellers and printers bore {{the brunt of}} this law, the effects of which {{came to a head}} in the 1794 Treason Trials. Johnson testified, publicly distancing himself from Paine and Barlow, {{despite the fact that the}} <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> received sympathetically by the juries.|$|E
5|$|Five <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> then {{indicted for}} {{stealing}} £50 {{from the house}} of Robert Edwards in Ely. Mr Gurney addressed the jury at length describing the events occurring {{in the town of}} Ely {{on the morning of the}} 23 May 1816. Eight witnesses were called. The jury returned guilty verdicts against Dennis, Jefferson, and Rutter. Hopkin and Cammell were given not guilty verdicts.|$|E
50|$|In Smith v Hughes (1960), the <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> charged {{under the}} Street Offences Act 1959 {{which made it}} an offence to solicit {{prostitution}} in a public place. The <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> soliciting from within private premises (windows or on balconies) {{so they could be}} seen by the public without entering into the streets. The court applied the mischief rule holding that the activities of the <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> within the mischief of the Act, and soliciting from within a house, is soliciting and molesting of the public. Therefore it is the same as if the <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> outside on the street.|$|R
50|$|On 29 January 2009, Harju Maakohus {{dismissed}} the lawsuit and lifted all related temporary injunctions, {{ruling that the}} plaintiff has not proven that the <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> the show's producer, and therefore, that the appropriate <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> sued.|$|R
25|$|In general, if a <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> found incompetent {{to proceed}} to trial, the {{criminal}} proceedings are suspended. In those cases, where the charges are petty, the charges are often dropped or a plea bargain may be made in which the charges are nolle prossed if the defendant agrees to seek treatment. Otherwise, the <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> usually committed to a psychiatric hospital for treatment until the <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> restored to competency, {{at which point the}} trial will proceed.|$|R
5|$|In April 1918, Haywood and 100 of the arrested IWW members {{began their}} trial, {{presided over by}} Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis. The trial lasted five months, the longest {{criminal}} trial up to that time; Haywood himself testified for three days. All 101 <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> found guilty, and Haywood (along with fourteen others) was sentenced to twenty years in prison.|$|E
5|$|On 21 May 1976 several Tamil {{politicians}} (A. Amirthalingam, V. N. Navaratnam, K. P. Ratnam, M. Sivasithamparam and K. Thurairatnam) were delivering leaflets {{when they}} were all arrested on government orders. Sivasithamparam was released but the others were taken to Colombo and tried for sedition. All the <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> acquitted on 10 February 1977 after a high-profile trial-at-bar case in which around 70 prominent Tamil lawyers, including Chelvanayakam and G. G. Ponnambalam, acted for the defence.|$|E
5|$|On July 4, the <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> {{informed}} {{that they would}} have to finish preparing their defense by July 9. They announced a hunger strike in response, saying that two working days was inadequate time to finish preparing their trial defense. On July 21, the court extended their pre-trial detention by a further six months.|$|E
5000|$|In law, {{an anchor}} <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> {{a person who}} <b>is</b> made a <b>defendant</b> to a claim for {{the primary purpose of}} vesting {{jurisdiction}} to hear the claim in a certain court. Usually the purpose of the anchor <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> to allow claims to be brought in a certain court against another defendant (not the anchor defendant) over whom the relevant court would not otherwise have jurisdiction. [...] Accordingly, use of anchor <b>defendants</b> <b>is</b> often a variation of forum shopping.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, some jurisdictions add the {{question}} of whether or not the <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> in control of their behavior at the time of the offense. For example, if the <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> compelled by some aspect of their mental illness to commit the illegal act, the <b>defendant</b> could <b>be</b> evaluated as not in control of their behavior at the time of the offense.|$|R
50|$|C The <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> guilty.|$|R
5|$|On Thursday morning 20 June two <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> {{indicted for}} {{stealing}} silverware {{from the home}} of Rev. J. Vachell in Littleport and one was charged with receiving the stolen goods. Four witnesses called were Elizabeth Carter following which Mr Justice Burrough summed up. Lavender was pronounced guilty of the theft and Beamiss and Butcher received not guilty verdicts.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} day one {{prisoner}} pleaded guilty to charges of riot and conspiracy to riot, and was also acquitted of the murder charge. The other <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> also acquitted of murder due to the unreliability of eyewitness testimony {{and the possibility that}} White had died from a pre-existing thrombotic condition. On 16 April, four defendants including Paul Taylor were convicted of rioting, and the remaining four including Alan Lord were acquitted.|$|E
5|$|Seven <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> then {{indicted for}} {{breaking}} into the house of Josiah Dewey in Littleport, stealing money and property and assaulting Dewey. Mr Gurney addressed the jury. Three witnesses testified. The jury recorded a verdict of guilty against Chevall, Easey, Jessop, South and Benton; Dann and Torrington were acquitted. The court adjourned at 5pm.|$|E
5000|$|Suppose, {{that the}} {{proposition}} {{to be proven}} <b>is</b> that <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> {{the source of a}} hair found at the crime scene. Before learning that the hair was a genetic match for the defendant’s hair, the factfinder believes that the odds are 2 to 1 that the <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> the source of the hair. If she used Bayes’ theorem, she could multiply those prior odds by a “likelihood ratio” in order to update her odds after learning that the hair matched the defendant’s hair. The likelihood ratio is a statistic derived by comparing the odds that the evidence (expert testimony of a match) would be found if the <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> the source with the odds that it would <b>be</b> found if <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> not the source. If it is ten times more likely that the testimony of a match would occur if the <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> the source than if not, then the factfinder should multiply her prior odds by ten, giving posterior odds of 20 to one.|$|R
5000|$|.....shall be {{inflicted by}} {{intravenous}} injection of a substance or substances in a lethal quantity sufficient to cause death {{and until the}} <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> dead, or, at {{the election of the}} defendant, by hanging by the neck until the <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> dead." ...|$|R
5000|$|Upon appeal by Plaintiffs to the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit Decision, [...] "the {{judgment}} {{in favor of}} <b>defendants</b> <b>was</b> reversed, the district court's order granting attorneys' fees to <b>defendants</b> <b>was</b> vacated, and the case was remanded for further proceedings." ...|$|R
5|$|Six <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> then {{charged with}} {{stealing}} from George Stevens in Ely. Three witness were examined following which Dennis, Layton, Atkin, and Cammell were all pronounced guilty by the jury. Capital convictions against Aaron Chevall and William Beamiss, for robbing Henry Tansley of two £1 notes, were also returned by the jury. The court adjourned at 6pm.|$|E
5|$|Then nine <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> {{charged with}} {{threatening}} W. Cooper of Ely and stealing from him. Mr Gurney addressed the jury, explaining {{the circumstances of}} the disturbances carried out by the mob in Ely. Nine witnesses were called. Mr Justice Abbott spoke to the jury for a long time. The jury retired for fifteen minutes. On returning, it pronounced as guilty Dennis, Jessop, Atkin, Layton, Hobbs, Pricke, Cooper, and Jefferson. It acquitted Freeman.|$|E
5|$|While admitting {{none of the}} <b>defendants</b> <b>were</b> {{involved}} in the bombing, the prosecution made the argument that Lingg had built the bomb and two prosecution witnesses (Harry Gilmer and Malvern Thompson) tried to imply the bomb thrower was helped by Spies, Fischer and Schwab. The defendants claimed they {{had no knowledge of}} the bomber at all.|$|E
50|$|The Court, in a {{unanimous}} opinion by Justice Brennan, {{held that the}} collateral order doctrine {{does not apply to}} a forum selection clause. This was not a case where the <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> claiming a right not to be tried at all, like a sovereign immunity case, which would be disposed of before the <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> even subject to the discovery process. Instead, the <b>defendant</b> <b>was</b> acknowledging that it could be sued, but merely disputing the appropriate forum for the suit.|$|R
50|$|A {{sentencing}} judge {{also has}} the power to delay the time before a <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> allowed to apply for parole. The maximum parole ineligibility period is half of the sentence or ten years, whichever comes first, unless the <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> sentenced to life imprisonment.|$|R
25|$|A {{statistical}} test procedure {{is comparable to}} a criminal trial; a <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> considered not guilty {{as long as his}} or her guilt is not proven. The prosecutor tries to prove the guilt of the defendant. Only when there is enough charging evidence the <b>defendant</b> <b>is</b> convicted.|$|R
