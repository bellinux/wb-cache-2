More {{severe cases}} may require muscular paralysis with vecuronium, intubation, and artificial ventilation. Suxamethonium {{is not recommended}} for muscular paralysis as it may {{increase the risk of}} cardiac <b>dysrhythmia</b> from hyperkalemia associated with rhabdomyolysis. Antipyretic agents are not recommended as the increase in body temperature is due to muscular activity, not a hypothalamic temperature set point abnormality.|$|E

40|$|SummaryBackground and objectivesCardiac <b>dysrhythmias</b> are {{relatively}} {{common in the}} perioperative period and should be adequately diagnosed and treated by the anesthesiologist whenever indicated. The objective {{of this article was}} to review the most relevant aspects of cardiac <b>dysrhythmias,</b> as well as establishing the cause-effect relationship between drugs used in the perioperative period and <b>dysrhythmias.</b> ContentsThe mechanisms of <b>dysrhythmias,</b> drugs that can potentially cause <b>dysrhythmias,</b> besides diagnosis and treatment in the perioperative period are presented. ConclusionsPerioperative <b>dysrhythmias</b> oftentimes do not require treatment and in others the treatment can generate iatrogenicity. Therefore, the knowledge of cardiac <b>dysrhythmias</b> and triggering factors allows a better approach of the perioperative period by the anesthesiologist avoiding wrong or unnecessary treatment...|$|R
40|$|Pediatric <b>dysrhythmias</b> {{are rare}} but {{important}} causes of admission to pediatric clinics and emergency departments. Due {{to the development}} of successful surgical treatment of congenital heart diseases and improvements in the diagnostic tools, pediatric <b>dysrhythmias</b> are more frequently diagnosed. Although pediatric <b>dysrhythmias</b> are may be asymptomatic, they may manifest with weakness, dizziness, decrease in the effort capacity, easy fatigability, irregularity in heartbeats, palpitations, syncope and cardiac arrest. Since <b>dysrhythmias</b> may give rise to significant hemodynamic outcomes, their recognition by pediatricians and family physicians is vital for the patients. This review aims to contribute to the correct diagnosis and management of the cases with frequently encountered pediatric <b>dysrhythmias...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} was {{designed}} to investigate the mechanisms by which ropivacaine may act within the central nervous system (CNS) to produce cardiotoxicity. Eighty New Zealand rabbits were divided into four groups randomly. In Group 1, 20 rabbits received intracerebroventricular (icv) saline, and then received icv ropivacaine 30 min later. In Group 2, 20 rabbits received icv ropivacaine. Whenever <b>dysrhythmias</b> continued for more than 5 min, 0. 1 ml saline was administered into the left cerebral ventricle. Ten minutes later, 0. 1 ml midazolam was given into the left lateral ventricle. In Group 3, 20 rabbits received icv ropivacaine, and once the <b>dysrhythmias</b> developed, the inspired isoflurane concentration was increased from 0. 75 % to 1. 50 %. In Group 4, 20 animals received an intravenous (iv) phenylephrine infusion until <b>dysrhythmias</b> occurred. In Group 1, the rabbits did not develop <b>dysrhythmias</b> in response to icv saline, whereas <b>dysrhythmias</b> did develop in these animals after icv ropivacaine. In Group 2, icv saline had no effect on the dysrhythmias; however, icv midazolam terminated cardiac <b>dysrhythmias.</b> In Group 3, an increase in the concentration of the inspired isoflurane had no effect on <b>dysrhythmias.</b> In Group 4, icv midazolam had no effect on <b>dysrhythmias</b> in response to iv phenylephrine. Ropivacaine administered directly into the CNS is capable of producing cardiac dysrhythmias; midazolam terminated <b>dysrhythmias</b> presumably by potentiation of Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor activity. Our results suggest that ropivacaine produces some of its cardiotoxicity not only by the direct cardiotoxicity of the drug, but also by the CNS effects of ropivacaine...|$|R
25|$|Antiarrhythmic agents, {{also known}} as cardiac <b>dysrhythmia</b> medications, are a group of {{pharmaceuticals}} {{that are used to}} suppress abnormal rhythms of the heart (cardiac arrhythmias), such as atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation.|$|E
25|$|An EKG tracing is {{affected}} by patient motion. Some rhythmic motions (such as shivering or tremors) can {{create the illusion of}} cardiac <b>dysrhythmia.</b> Artifacts are distorted signals caused by a secondary internal or external sources, such as muscle movement or interference from an electrical device.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{approach}} to evaluation begins by {{assessment of the}} airway, breathing, and circulation followed by a medical history and physical examination. Signs that represent significant severity include hypotension, hypoxemia, tracheal deviation, altered mental status, unstable <b>dysrhythmia,</b> stridor, intercostal indrawing, cyanosis, tripod positioning, pronounced use of accessory muscles (sternocleidomastoid, scalenes) and absent breath sounds.|$|E

The incidence of <b>dysrhythmias</b> during surgery was not significantly different during the two procedures. However prior to surgery, 25 % of the patients had <b>dysrhythmias</b> during sedation with midazolam. The majority of <b>dysrhythmias</b> were infrequent unifocal ventricular ectopics.

40|$|Continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) {{records were}} made over 24 hours in 130 ambulant outpatients {{complaining}} of syncope, dizzy turns, or palpitation. In all these patients resting ECGs {{had failed to}} show significant <b>dysrhythmias.</b> Exercise testing was performed on 64 patients and also failed to reveal any <b>dysrhythmias.</b> Analysis of the tape recordings, however, showed appreciable <b>dysrhythmias</b> in 74 % of the group. In most cases the <b>dysrhythmias</b> were complex mixtures of rapid supraventricular and ventricular rhythms. bouts of ventricular tachycardia were seen in seven patients, {{all of whom were}} women. Episodic complete heart block was seen in only two patients, but prolonged ventricular gaps (greater than 1 - 5 s), not associated with ectopic beats, were found in 26. No episodes of ventricular fibrillation were recorded. We conclude that many patients with vague symptoms suggestive of transient cerebral ischaemia or irregular heart action have significant and often dangerous <b>dysrhythmias</b> which can be diagnosed only by long-term recording of the ECG under fully ambulant conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{value of}} {{continuous}} long-term ECG monitoring {{in patients with}} transient generalized neurological symptoms is well established, but its value in transient focal neurological deficits is less clear.

25|$|These direct cardiac effects include {{decreased}} {{heart rate}} (i.e. cardiovascular depression), decreased contractility, and decreased electrical conductivity (i.e., increased PR, AH, HV, and QRS intervals). These effects {{appear to be}} due to their local anesthetic activity and are not reversed by naloxone. Widening of the QRS complex appears to be a result of a quinidine-like effect of propoxyphene, and sodium bicarbonate therapy appears to have a positive direct effect on the QRS <b>dysrhythmia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Complications {{associated}} with brachial plexus block include intra-arterial or intravenous injection, {{which can lead}} to local anesthetic toxicity. This may be characterized by serious central nervous system problems such as epileptic seizure, central nervous system depression, and coma. Cardiovascular effects of local anesthetic toxicity include slowing of the heart rate and impairment of its ability to pump blood through the circulatory system, which may lead to circulatory collapse. In severe cases, cardiac <b>dysrhythmia,</b> cardiac arrest and death may occur. Other rare but serious complications from brachial plexus block include pneumothorax and persistent paresis of the phrenic nerve.|$|E

40|$|An {{observational}} {{field study}} {{was performed on}} a well-know purebred horses in Iran (Khozestan-Arab horse). The study was conducted on 105 apparently healthy horses. To find the prevalence of cardiac <b>dysrhythmias</b> in different sexes and ages, the horses were divided into 2 sexes (63 females and 42 males) and three age groups (0 - 4, 4 - 8, > 8 years old). After taking the history and performing clinical examination, ECG was obtained on a base apex lead system with the paper speed of 25 mm sec 1 and sensitivity of 10 or 5 mm mv 1 at rest. The electrocardiograms were evaluated according to the criteria of normal cardiac rate and rhythm. Analysis variance, tuckey test, independent samples t-test and chi-square were used for Statistical analysis. The results showed that, 36. 2 % of the horses were affected with some types of <b>dysrhythmias.</b> The most frequent <b>dysrhythmias</b> were sinus tachycardia, sinus arrhythmia and heart blocks respectively. After exercise, many cardiac <b>dysrhythmias</b> were disappeared (physiologic <b>dysrhythmias).</b> Although the prevalence of cardiac <b>dysrhythmias</b> in mares and 4 to 8 years old horses were more than stallions and other age groups, respectively, but the differences were not significant (p> 0. 05).

25|$|In angina {{patients}} momentarily {{not feeling}} any chest pain, an electrocardiogram (ECG) is typically normal unless {{there have been}} other cardiac problems in the past. During periods of pain, depression, or elevation of the ST segment may be observed. To elicit these changes, an exercise ECG test ("treadmill test") may be performed, during which the patient exercises to his/her maximum ability before fatigue, breathlessness, or pain intervenes; if characteristic ECG changes are documented (typically more than 1mm of flat or downsloping ST depression), the test is considered diagnostic for angina. Even constant monitoring of the blood pressure and the pulse rate can lead to some conclusion regarding angina. The exercise test is also useful in looking for other markers of myocardial ischemia: blood pressure response (or lack thereof, in particular, a drop in systolic blood pressure), <b>dysrhythmia</b> and chronotropic response. Other alternatives to a standard exercise test include a thallium scintigram or sestamibi scintigram (in patients unable to exercise enough {{for the purposes of the}} treadmill tests, e.g., due to asthma or arthritis or in whom the ECG is too abnormal at rest) or Stress Echocardiography.|$|E

He {{is one of only}} six players in One Day International history to have three or more scores of 150. In 2005, Gayle was dropped for the first Test against South Africa along with six other players following a dispute over sponsorship issues (see below). He returned for the second Test but had a poor series until the fourth Test, where he made a match-saving 317. It was the first-ever triple century against South Africa and up until Mahela Jayawardene made 374, it was the highest individual Test score against them. In another match of the series, Gayle had to leave the field after complaining of dizziness. During a subsequent series against Australia, Gayle again complained of dizziness and shortness of breath during his innings. He left the field for a time, and was after the match sent to hospital where he was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect causing a cardiac <b>dysrhythmia.</b> He underwent heart surgery following the series to correct the defect.

40|$|The equine {{practitioner}} {{is faced}} {{with a wide variety}} of <b>dysrhythmias,</b> of which some are physiological. The recording of an exercise electrocardiogram (ECG) can help distinguish between physiological and pathological <b>dysrhythmias,</b> underlining the importance of exercise recordings. The evaluation of an ECG recording should be performed in a highly methodical manner in order to avoid errors. Each P wave should be followed by a QRS complex, and each QRS complex should be preceded by a P wave. The classification of <b>dysrhythmias</b> according to their origin helps to understand the associated changes on the ECG. In this respect, sinoatrial nodal (SA nodal), atrial myocardial, atrioventricular nodal (AV nodal) and ventricular myocardial <b>dysrhythmias</b> can be distinguished. Artefacts on the ECG can lead to misinterpretations. Recording an ECG of good quality is a prerequisite to prevent misinterpretations, but artefacts are almost impossible to avoid when recording during exercise. Changes in P or T waves during exercise also often lead to misinterpretations, however they have no clinical significance...|$|R
