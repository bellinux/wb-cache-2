5|$|An {{anonymous}} {{review of}} Srigala <b>Item</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Surabaya-based daily Soerabaijasch Handelsblad was positive, predicting the film {{would be a}} commercial success. This prediction was fulfilled, as Srigala Item reached extensive audiences– mostly lower-class natives. The Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran credits this success to escapism. He writes that the film's theme of an oppressed, financially destitute youth {{who is able to}} control his destiny by becoming a masked vigilante, allowed viewers {{to be able to see}} themselves as the Black Wolf, and thus take revenge against those who had wronged them.|$|E
5|$|Benford's law {{describes}} {{the occurrence of}} digits in many data sets, such as heights of buildings. According to Benford's law, {{the probability that the}} first decimal-digit of an <b>item</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> data sample is d (from 1 to 9) equals , regardless of the unit of measurement. Thus, about 30% of the data can be expected to have 1 as first digit, 18% start with 2, etc. Auditors examine deviations from Benford's law to detect fraudulent accounting.|$|E

5|$|More recently, {{research}} at the Duke Lemur Center {{has shown that the}} ring-tailed lemur can organize sequences in memory and retrieve ordered sequences without language. The experimental design demonstrated that the lemurs were using internal representation of the sequence to guide their responses and not simply following a trained sequence, where one <b>item</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sequence cues the selection of the next. But this is not the limit of the ring-tailed lemur's reasoning skills. Another study, performed at the Myakka City Lemur Reserve, suggests that this species along with several other closely related lemur species understand simple arithmetic operations.|$|E
5|$|Also on {{show is a}} late 19th-century shambar (large veil) from Bayt Jibrin worn at {{weddings and}} festivals. It is made of {{embroidered}} handwoven black silk with a separate heavy red silk fringe. A woman wore the shambar mainly on her wedding day, positioned so that when she covered her face the embroidered end would show. Another <b>item</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> collection is a headdress (iraqiyeh) embroidered with cross-stitch and decorated with Ottoman coins minted in AH 1223 (1808), as well as Maria Theresa coins. The iraqiyeh was worn by married women and elaborate pieces were passed down as family heirlooms. Long embroidered headbands made of cotton hanging from both sides were wrapped around the woman's braids to facilitate the bundling of her hair, then secured {{to the back of}} the headdress.|$|E
5|$|Beyond French fries, {{the company}} has {{introduced}} several other side products {{over the course of}} its existence. Onion rings {{have been part of the}} menu for the majority of BK history. Originally made from whole, sliced onions, they were reformulated into a formed product made from onion paste in 2001 as part of a menu revamp. In the same 2001 menu revamp, the company added an onion ring-specific dipping sauce, and emphasized it again during its 99¢ BK Value Menu introduction in 2002. As part of its BK Cravers value menu introduction in 2005, the company briefly sold jalapeño poppers accompanied by a side of ranch dressing as part of its national menu. The same menu added mozzarella sticks with a side of marinara sauce; the mozzarella sticks have since been relegated to a regional menu <b>item</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States, but are sold on the national menu in Canada.|$|E

5|$|In {{another study}} that {{appeared}} in the British Journal of Psychology, researchers tested how respondents considered balance in artwork composition of differing qualities. Fifteen pairs of works from ArtCyclopedia by artists such as Paul Gauguin, Georgia O'Keeffe, and Georges-Pierre Seurat, and fifteen from MOBA by artists including Doug Caderette, Unknown, and D. Alix were shown to participants; in each, an <b>item</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> painting was shifted vertically or horizontally, and respondents were asked to identify the original. The researchers hypothesized that respondents would identify balance and composition more easily in the traditional masterworks, and that study participants would find a greater change of quality when items were shifted in traditional masterworks than they would in MOBA pieces. However, the study concluded that balance alone did not define art of higher quality for the participants, and that respondents were more likely to see that original art was more balanced than the altered version, not necessarily that the traditional art was significantly better composed and balanced than MOBA works.|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to analyze the impact of persistence, amount and benchmark of special items to the separated presentation of special <b>items</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> income statement. Persistence, amount and benchmark are used as an indicator to analyze the relationship between informational motivation with the separated presentation of special <b>items</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> income statement. The sample of this study was all of the financial statement of manufacture entities that listed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bursa Efek Indonesia during 2008 - 2009. Analysis tool that used to examine <b>the</b> hypothesis <b>in</b> this study is linear regression. The result shows that special items persistence is negative and significant to the separated presentation of special <b>items</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> income statement. The special items amount is significant to the separated presentation of special <b>items</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> income statement.

In this paper, we further propose the modified Pulak and Al-Sultan model with quadratic quality loss function. There are four cases considered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> modified model: (1) <b>the</b> non-conforming <b>items</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sample of accepted lot are neither replaced nor eliminated from the lot; (2) <b>the</b> non-conforming <b>items</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sample of accepted lot are not replaced but are eliminated from the lot;�(3) <b>the</b> non-conforming <b>items</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sample of accepted lot are replaced by conforming ones; (4) <b>the</b> non-conforming <b>items</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sample of accepted lot are replaced by non-inspected items.
