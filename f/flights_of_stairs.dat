5|$|Gregg Allman became {{interested}} in the Hammond after Mike Finnigan had introduced him to Jimmy Smith's music, and started to write material with it. His brother Duane specifically requested he play the instrument when forming the Allman Brothers Band, and he was presented with a brand new B-3 and Leslie 122RV upon joining. Allman recalls the instrument was cumbersome to transport, particularly on <b>flights</b> <b>of</b> <b>stairs,</b> which often required the whole band's assistance. Author Frank Moriarty considers Allman's Hammond playing a vital ingredient of the band's sound.|$|E
5|$|On December 27, 1977, {{just two}} weeks after the incident, Washington was traded to the Boston Celtics. Red Auerbach, Boston's general manager lived in the Washington, D.C. area, and had been a {{longtime}} fan of Washington's. Pat stayed behind as the couple had two young children, and Washington would be staying in a hotel. While he waited for his reinstatement, which he thought would not occur until the next season, he became depressed and fell out of shape. He pulled himself together, and began {{running up and down the}} <b>flights</b> <b>of</b> <b>stairs</b> of the 29-story hotel.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1904 {{he built}} the Chalet de Catllaràs, in La Pobla de Lillet, for the Asland cement factory, owned by Eusebi Güell. It has a simple {{structure}} though very original, {{in the shape}} of a pointed arch, with two semi-circular <b>flights</b> <b>of</b> <b>stairs</b> leading to the top two floors. This building fell into ruin when the cement works closed, and when it was eventually restored its appearance was radically altered, the ingenious original staircase being replaced with a simpler metal one. In the same area he created the Can Artigas Gardens between 1905 and 1907, in an area called Font de la Magnesia, commissioned by the textile merchant Joan Artigas i Alart; men who had worked the Park Güell were also involved on this project, similar to the famous park in Barcelona.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the initial}} scenes of despair and panic that had issued from that quadrant, patrons {{in the lower}} parquet and parquet circle were able to escape in under three minutes, having access to Flood's Alley and Washington Street exits and having no <b>flights</b> <b>of</b> <b>stairs</b> to negotiate.

25|$|Away {{fans for}} league matches were {{originally}} accommodated {{in the upper}} level, in the north west corner, which can hold a maximum of 3,000 fans. However, plans were made {{at the end of}} the 2007–2008 season to relocate the away supporters to the far end of the upper level of the Leazes End. This location has attracted criticism due to the poor view offered by being so far from the pitch due the height of the stand, and the 14 <b>flights</b> <b>of</b> <b>stairs</b> to reach the upper level. For FA Cup matches the lower section of the corner is also used.|$|E
25|$|Coming {{from a poor}} family, {{at the age of}} nine, Siti had to wake up at 4:00am to {{help her}} mother making and selling various {{homemade}} kuih in her neighbourhood, where sometimes, she also had to carry a makeshift table down three <b>flights</b> <b>of</b> <b>stairs</b> to the main road to set up a small stall. She commented that all the hardships have not only helped her to be more frugal when spending, but also to be more confident when communicating with the public. She also jokingly said that the whole experience has helped to improve her vocal skills as she has to shout to call for customers. Apart from participating in singing competitions, she also used to follow her uncle, Abdul Rahim Bachik to invitational shows like wedding ceremonies and dinner parties which have helped to expose her to performing live.|$|E
25|$|Charles Straub had {{a seat in}} {{the family}} circle close to the stairway; he was in the company of his friend Joseph Kreamer. He remembered, “we could hardly run down the stairs; we were crowded down.” Though at first he saw no smoke, {{by the time he had}} been carried down to the last flight, it had grown thicker. There he tripped and people fell on top of him. By then the last flight of stairs was dark and full of smoke. Straub {{struggled}} up and stumbled forward. He estimated that about twenty-five people had gotten out ahead of him. Wondrously, though he had been pushed down three <b>flights</b> <b>of</b> <b>stairs</b> and thought that hundreds had fallen on top of him, only about ten or twelve people came out onto the street after him. He waited around the Washington Street entrance for three-quarters of an hour, but he never saw his friend Kreamer emerge from the stairway, nor did he ever see him again.|$|E

25|$|The courthouse's base floor, {{elevated}} {{above the}} ground of the surrounding square and accessible from steps {{on each side of}} the building except the wheelchair-accessible west side, holds space for several county offices arranged around central crossing corridors connecting the entrances in the middle of each side of the building in each cardinal direction. The base floor also includes the county judge's courtroom, a vault for storage of county records, restrooms, and storage space. On the east side of the building, two <b>flights</b> <b>of</b> <b>stairs</b> lead to the second floor. The first flight consists of two separate stairways that combine around the base of a wider central flight ending at the second floor facing the entrance to the main courtroom. A second stairway is located south of the west end of the building's main central corridor and is used to provide access to offices and other facilities behind the upper courtroom and as use as a secondary fire escape. An elevator on the southeast side of the building also adjoins the two main floors.|$|E
25|$|In general, elite Aksumite {{buildings}} such as palaces {{were constructed}} atop podia built of loose stones {{held together with}} mud-mortar, with carefully cut granite corner blocks which rebated back a few centimeters at regular intervals as the wall got higher, so the walls narrowed as they rose higher. These podia are often all that survive of Aksumite ruins. Above the podia, walls were generally build with alternating layers of loose stone (often whitewashed, like at Yemrehana Krestos Church) and horizontal wooden beams, with smaller round wooden beams set in the stonework often projecting out of the walls (these are called 'monkey heads') on the exterior and sometimes the interior. Both the podia and the walls above exhibited no long straight stretches, but were indented at regular intervals so that any long walls consisted {{of a series of}} recesses and salients. This helped to strengthen the walls. Worked granite was used for architectural features including columns, bases, capitals, doors, windows, paving, water spouts (often shaped like lion heads) and so on, as well as enormous <b>flights</b> <b>of</b> <b>stairs</b> that often flanked the walls of palace pavilions on several sides. Doors and windows were usually framed by stone or wooden cross-members, linked at the corners by square 'monkey heads', though simple lintels were also used. Many of these Aksumite features are seen carved into the famous stelae {{as well as in the}} later rock hewn churches of Tigray and Lalibela.|$|E
500|$|This {{station has}} two fare control areas. The {{full-time}} {{side at the}} west (railroad south) end has a turnstile bank, token booth, and two staircases {{going up to the}} southeast and northwest corners of East 206th Street and Bainbridge Avenue. [...] Because of the varying topography of the surrounding neighborhood, a single escalator was installed in 1937 in this fare control area, traversing an elevation difference of [...] between the mezzanine and platform. Access to fare control otherwise requires walking up three <b>flights</b> <b>of</b> <b>stairs</b> from platform level.|$|E

500|$|Ketevan Melua, {{known as}} Ketino to her family, {{was born to}} Amiran and Tamara Melua in Kutaisi, Georgia, which was then part of the Soviet Union. She spent her first years with her {{grandparents}} in Tbilisi before moving {{with her parents and}} brother to the town of Batumi, Ajaria, where her father worked as a heart specialist. During this time, Melua sometimes had to carry buckets of water up five <b>flights</b> <b>of</b> <b>stairs</b> to her family's flat and according to her, [...] "Now, when I'm staying in luxurious hotels, I think back to those days".|$|E
500|$|Pinnipeds {{can move}} around on land, {{though not as}} well as {{terrestrial}} animals. Otariids and walruses are capable of turning their hind-flippers forward and under the body so they can [...] "walk" [...] on all fours. The fore-flippers move in a transverse, rather than a sagittal fashion. Otariids rely on the movements of their heads and necks more than their hind-flippers during terrestrial locomotion. By swinging their heads and necks, otariids create momentum while they are moving. Sea lions have been recorded climbing up <b>flights</b> <b>of</b> <b>stairs.</b> Phocids are less agile on land. They cannot pull their hind-flippers forward, and move on land by lunging, bouncing and wiggling while their fore-flippers keep them balanced. Some species use their fore-flippers to pull themselves forward. Terrestrial locomotion is easier for phocids on ice, as they can sled along.|$|E
500|$|The first {{music video}} debuted on July 14, {{featuring}} the song [...] "Tacky". Produced by Nerdist Industries, the one-shot video mimicks Williams' own style {{used in his}} video for [...] "Happy": It features Aisha Tyler, Margaret Cho, Eric Stonestreet, Kristen Schaal, Jack Black and Yankovic dressed in tacky clothes and dancing poorly on purpose while lip-synching to the song's lyrics about a person who brags on about his questionable style choices. The video was filmed at Palace Theatre in downtown Los Angeles, previously featured as Julianne Moore's apartment in 1998 film The Big Lebowski. Yankovic specified that during {{each of the six}} continuous takes, he would have to rush down five <b>flights</b> <b>of</b> <b>stairs</b> while changing his outfit in order to appear in {{the beginning and end of}} the video. The video for [...] "Word Crimes" [...] features kinetic typography created by Jarrett Heather, reflecting the song's theme of proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation. The [...] "Foil" [...] video, produced in conjunction with CollegeHumor, shows Yankovic as the host of a cooking show obsessing on the use of aluminium foil, suddenly descending into conspiracy theories; it also includes guest appearances by Patton Oswalt, Tom Lennon, and Robert Ben Garant.|$|E

25|$|Furthest {{from the}} stage and up against the theatre ceiling, the family circle offered the {{cheapest}} accommodations and had the most roundabout access to the street. The passageway started from the gallery, passed through a curtain partition, then descended southward down a short <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> <b>stairs</b> to a platform set against the south wall. It turned right (west) and descended another <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> <b>stairs</b> anchored to the south wall, ending at a second floor corridor. Patrons would turn right into this corridor and follow the passageway northward along the west wall to the family circle box office. The passage then turned left, westward again, descended a third <b>flight</b> <b>of</b> <b>stairs</b> down to a short, street-level hallway that led onto Washington Street (See Floor Plan 2).|$|R
