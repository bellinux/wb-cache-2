40|$|The thesis {{examines}} {{the emergence of}} a new idea [...] trade union investment <b>funds.</b> <b>The</b> thesis looks at their establishment in Sweden, Italy and Quebec in the years 1983 - 84.

The evolution of <b>the</b> general <b>fund</b> idea is exposed as is the debate over the significance of <b>the</b> <b>funds</b> in intellectual, political and union circles.

5|$|Although Bomis began {{a search}} for experts to vet Nupedia articles, this proved tedious.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the performance of}} Canadian fixed-income mutual <b>funds</b> in <b>the</b> context of an unobservable market factor that affects mutual fund returns. We use various selection and timing models augmented with univariate and multivariate regime-switching structures. These models assume a joint distribution of an unobservable latent variable and <b>fund</b> returns. <b>The</b> <b>fund</b> sample comprises six Canadian value-weighted portfolios with different investing objectives from 1980 to 2011. These are <b>the</b> Canadian fixed-income <b>funds,</b> <b>the</b> Canadian inflation protected fixed-income <b>funds,</b> <b>the</b> Canadian long-term fixed-income <b>funds,</b> <b>the</b> Canadian money market <b>funds,</b> <b>the</b> Canadian short-term fixed-income <b>funds</b> and <b>the</b> high yield fixed-income funds. We find strong evidence {{that more than one}} state variable is necessary to explain the dynamics of the returns on Canadian fixed-income funds. For instance, Canadian fixed-income funds clearly show that there are two regimes that can be identified with a turning point during the mid-eighties. This structural break corresponds to an increase in the Canadian bond index from its low values in the early 1980 s to its current high values...|$|R
