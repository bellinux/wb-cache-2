40|$|The {{study of}} protein O-glycosylation is {{receiving}} increasing attention in biological, medical, and biopharmaceutical research. Improved techniques {{are required to}} allow reproducible and quantitative analysis of O-glycans. An established approach for O-glycan analysis relies on their chemical release in high yield by hydrazinolysis, followed by fluorescent labeling at the reducing terminus and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) profiling. However, an unwanted degradation known as "peeling" often compromises hydrazinolysis for O-glycan analysis. Here we addressed this problem using low-molarity solutions of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in hydrazine for O-glycan release. O-linked glycans {{from a range of}} different glycoproteins were analyzed, including bovine fetuin, bovine submaxillary gland mucin, and serum immunoglobulin A (IgA). The data for the O-glycans released by hydrazine with anhydrous <b>EDTA</b> or <b>disodium</b> <b>salt</b> dihydrate <b>EDTA</b> show high yields of the native O-glycans compared with the peeled product, resulting in a markedly increased robustness of the O-glycan profiling method. The presented method for O-glycan release demonstrates significant reduction in peeling and reduces the number of sample handling steps prior to release. © 2014 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Plasma hydroperoxides (HPs) {{are widely}} {{accepted}} {{to be good}} indicators of oxidative stress. By means of the method proposed here, which uses diphenyl- 1 -pyrenylphosphine (DPPP) as a fluorescent probe, all types of plasma HP were determined. The limits of detection and quantification of the method were 0. 08 and 0. 25 nmol of cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) equivalents in 40 μl of plasma, respectively. The method is satisfactory in terms of precision (5. 3 % for 14. 5 μM CHP eq., n = 8), and the recoveries were 91 % and 92 % after standard additions of 26 and 52 μM CHP, respectively. The selectivity of the proposed method is higher than 96 %.

The complexation of copper and zinc by EDTA stabilized the solution. The deposition potential and {{the composition of}} the Cu–Zn bath were shown to influence the composition, morphology and phase composition of the Cu–Zn deposits. Scanning electron microscopy analysis showed that the best conditions to obtain smooth Cu–Zn deposits were at − 1. 45 V, with Cu 70 –Zn 30 and Cu 50 –Zn 50 baths, and at − 1. 60 V, with Cu 30 –Zn 70. Besides being smoother than others, these deposits were golden in colour. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis showed that a Zn content above 60 wt. % in the Cu–Zn deposits was achieved from the last bath, at − 1. 45 V.
