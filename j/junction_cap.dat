Therefore, deciphering how these two Apicomplexan protozoan parasites access their hosting cells has been highlighted as a high priority research with the relevant perspective of designing anti-invasive molecules to prevent diseases. Central to the mechanistic base of invasion for both genera is mechanical force, which {{is thought to be}} applied by the parasite at the interface between the two cells following assembly of a unique cell junction but this model lacks direct evidence and has been challenged by recent genetic and cell biology studies. In this work, using parasites expressing the fluorescent core component of this junction, we analyse characteristic features of the kinematics of penetration of more than 1000 invasion events. ResultsThe majority of invasion events occur with a typical forward rotational progression of the parasite through a static junction into a vacuole formed from the invaginating host cell plasma membrane, in which the parasite subsequently replicates. However, if parasites encounter resistance and if the junction is not strongly anchored to the host cell cortex, as when parasites do not secrete the toxofilin protein and therefore are unable to locally remodel the cortical actin cytoskeleton, the <b>junction</b> is <b>capped</b> backwards and travels retrogradely with the host cell membrane along the parasite surface as it is enclosed within a functional vacuole. Kinetic measurements of the invasive trajectories strongly support a similar parasite driven force in both static and <b>capped</b> <b>junctions,</b> both of which lead to successful invasion. However about 20 % of toxofilin mutants fail to enter and eventually disengage from the host cell membrane while the secreted RON 2 molecules are capped at the posterior pole before being cleaved and released in the medium. By contrast in cells characterized by low cortex tension and high cortical actin dynamics, <b>junction</b> <b>capping</b> and entry failure are drastically reduced. ConclusionThis kinematic analysis of pre-invasive and invasive T. gondii tachyzoite behaviors newly highlights that to invade cells, parasites need to engage their motor with the junction molecular complex where force is efficiently applied only upon proper anchorage to the host cell membrane and cortex...|$|R
40|$|The {{developing}} enamel matrix contains mostly amelogenins, {{which are}} hydrophobic proline-rich proteins. During amelogenesis, the amelogenins are presumably hydrolysed and {{removed from the}} enamel. Recently a number of metalloproteinases that may be important in amelogenesis {{have been identified in}} zymograms of the developing enamel matrix. In the present study an antibody specific for the matrix metalloproteinase collagenase activator protein (CAP) was characterized and used to identify this metalloproteinase in enamel. Immunoblotting showed that the CAP proteinase was present in the enamel matrix. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that the proteinase is localized in the enamel matrix, most specifically along the dentino-enamel <b>junction.</b> Purified <b>CAP</b> was found to hydrolyse amelogenin protein. Possible functions of the proteinase in the enamel matrix are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Demonstrator pens were {{originally}} furnished by manufacturers to dealers, {{so that the}} features of their products could be shown to potential buyers. The first demonstrators had openings cut in their barrels, and usually, their caps.

Cutaway demonstrators were usually not fully functional pens, and many were furnished without nibs or with nonfunctional dummy nibs.|$|R
40|$|Anti-Lepore haemoglobins (Hb) {{are rare}} βδ fusion {{variants}} {{that arise from}} non-homologous crossover during meiosis, resulting in a δ-βδ-β configuration. A novel anti-Lepore mutation (anti-Lepore Hong Kong) was found in two Chinese families with raised Hb A 2. Direct sequencing revealed a crossover within a 54 -bp region spanning the <b>junction</b> of <b>cap</b> site (CAP) and exon 1, which predicted the production of normal δ-globin. Determination of α/β-mRNA ratios by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction demonstrated downregulation of the β gene in cis due to the interposed βδ fusion gene. Although heterozygotes have normal red cell indices and are clinically silent, compound heterozygotes with β 0 mutation in trans produce a mild thalassaemia intermedia phenotype with a markedly raised Hb A 2 level that may mimic clinically mild Hb E-β+-thalassaemia. Awareness {{of the presence of}} anti-Lepore Hong Kong will help to resolve diagnostic problems in regions with significant prevalence of globin disorders. © 2007 The Authors. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Plasmodesmata {{linking the}} root cap and root in primary roots Zea mays are {{restricted}} to approx. 400 protodermal cells bordering approx. 110000 microns 2 of the calyptrogen of the root cap. This area is less than 10 % of the cross-sectional area of the root-tip at the <b>cap</b> <b>junction.</b> Therefore, gravitropic effectors moving from the root cap to the root can move symplastically only through a relatively small area in {{the centre of the}} root. Decapped roots are non-responsive to gravity. However, decapped roots whose caps are replaced immediately after decapping are strongly graviresponsive. Thus, gravicurvature occurs only when the root cap contacts the root, and symplastic continuity between the cap and root is not required for gravicurvature. Completely removing mucilage from the root tip renders the root non-responsive to gravity. Taken together, these data suggest that gravitropic effectors move apoplastically through mucilage from the cap to the root...|$|R
40|$|Assembly of the {{bacterial}} flagellar filament {{requires a}} type III export pathway for ordered delivery of structural subunits from the cytosol {{to the cell}} surface. This is facilitated by transient interaction with chaperones that protect subunits and pilot them to dock at the membrane export ATPase complex. We reveal that the essential export protein FliJ has a novel chaperone escort function in the pathway, specifically recruiting unladen chaperones for the minor filament-class subunits of the filament <b>cap</b> and hook-filament <b>junction</b> substructures. FliJ did not recognize unchaperoned subunits or chaperone-subunit complexes, and it associated with the membrane ATPase complex, suggesting a function postdocking. Empty chaperones that were recruited by FliJ in vitro were efficiently captured from FliJ-chaperone complexes by cognate subunits. FliJ and subunit bound to the same region on the target chaperone, but the cognate subunit had a ≈ 700 -fold greater affinity for chaperone than did FliJ. The data show that FliJ recruits chaperones and transfers them to subunits, and indicate that this is driven by competition for a common binding site. This escort mechanism provides {{a means by which}} free export chaperones can be cycled after subunit release, establishing a new facet of the secretion process. As FliJ does not escort the chaperone for the major filament subunit, cycling may offer a mechanism for export selectivity and thus promote assembly of the <b>junction</b> and <b>cap</b> substructures required for initiation of flagellin polymerization...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Apoplasmic {{barriers}} in plants fulfil important roles {{such as the}} control of apoplasmic movement of substances and the protection against invasion of pathogens. The {{aim of this study}} was to describe the development of apoplasmic barriers (Casparian bands and suberin lamellae) in endodermal cells of Arabidopsis thaliana primary root and during lateral root initiation. METHODS: Modifications of the endodermal cell walls in roots of wild-type Landsberg erecta (Ler) and mutants with defective endodermal development - scarecrow- 3 (scr- 3) and shortroot (shr) - of A. thaliana plants were characterized by light, fluorescent, confocal laser scanning, transmission and cryo-scanning electron microscopy. KEY RESULTS: In wild-type plant roots Casparian bands initiate at approx. 1600 µm from the root <b>cap</b> <b>junction</b> and suberin lamellae first appear on the inner primary cell walls at approx. 7000 - 8000 µm from the root apex in the region of developing lateral root primordia. When a single cell replaces a pair of endodermal and cortical cells in the scr- 3 mutant, Casparian band-like material is deposited ectopically at the junction between this 'cortical' cell and adjacent pericycle cells. Shr mutant roots with an undeveloped endodermis deposit Casparian band-like material in patches in the middle lamellae of cells of the vascular cylinder. Endodermal cells in the vicinity of developing lateral root primordia develop suberin lamellae earlier, and these are thicker, compared wih the neighbouring endodermal cells. Protruding primordia are protected by an endodermal pocket covered by suberin lamellae. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that endodermal cell-cell contact is required for the spatial control of Casparian band development. Additionally, the endodermal cells form a collet (collar) of short cells covered by a thick suberin layer at the base of lateral root, which may serve as a barrier constituting a 'safety zone' protecting the vascular cylinder against uncontrolled movement of water, solutes or various pathogens...|$|R
