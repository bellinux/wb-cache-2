On a hot day the cooled liquid absorbs heat from the battery pack, dispersing it through a radiator before pumping it through the chiller again. On a cold day the heated liquid warms the batteries, gradually bringing the system’s temperature to a level that allows it to efficiently accept charge energy and provide enough <b>discharge</b> <b>power</b> for expected vehicle performance.|$|E

40|$|The {{resonant}} type {{power supplies}} of medium frequency designed for magnetron sputtering processes often use pulse density modulation {{to regulate the}} average <b>discharge</b> <b>power</b> level. While the output power level changes then number of pulses in a group changes, but the discharge current pulses are the same from pulse to pulse: their parameters (duration time, amplitude) do not change with the <b>discharge</b> <b>power.</b> The goal {{of this paper is}} to present the influence of medium frequency <b>discharge</b> <b>power</b> level on the direct current I-V characteristics of a single Langmuir probe and resulting plasma parameters caused by the pulse density modulation. The sputtering processes of titanium and copper were diagnosed at two spatial positions. The measured Langmuir probe I-V characteristics showed strong dependence on the <b>discharge</b> <b>power.</b> As the discharge powering pulses stay the same with the <b>discharge</b> <b>power</b> level change, such influence was unlikely to occur. Using time-resolved analysis of probe current waveforms the origin of this influence was indicated. The influence of <b>discharge</b> <b>power</b> level on the single probe Langmuir I-V characteristics and resulting plasma parameters was eliminated using a simple method of scaling the results. Finally, the reliable plasma parameters were calculated...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} battery-aware static scheduling in batterypowered distributed real-time embedded systems. As {{suggested by}} previous work, reducing the discharge current level and shaping its distribution {{are essential for}} extending the battery lifespan. We propose two battery-aware static scheduling schemes. The first one optimizes the <b>discharge</b> <b>power</b> profile {{in order to maximize}} the utilization of the battery capacity. The second one targets distributed systems composed of voltage-scalable processing elements (PEs). It performs variable-voltage scheduling via efficient slack time re-allocation, which helps reduce the average <b>discharge</b> <b>power</b> consumption as well as flatten the <b>discharge</b> <b>power</b> profile. Both schemes guarantee the hard real-time constraints and precedence relationships in the real-time distributed embedded system specification. Based on previous work, we develop a battery lifespan evaluation metric which is aware of the shape of the <b>discharge</b> <b>power</b> profile. Our experimental results show that the battery lifespan can be increased by up to 29 % by optimizing the <b>discharge</b> <b>power</b> file alone. Our variable-voltage scheme increases the battery lifespan by up to 76 % over the non-voltage-scalable scheme and by up to 56 % over the variable-voltage scheme without slack-time reallocation. 1...|$|E

30|$|The overall {{structure}} of the proposed V 2 G controller is shown in Fig.  3. The flow chart summarizes (7)-(14). The controller updates the control signals at each time step by considering the load profile and the actual mobilities of PEVs connected to the grid. This requires a centralized control framework. A control center retrieves load profile data from the DSO, and charging/discharging requests and PEV characteristics from the electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) also known as charging stations. The controller calculates the <b>discharging</b> <b>power</b> references for each PEV for the remaining V 2 G period and each PEV discharges with respect to its own reference. Whenever a new PEV {{is connected to the}} grid, the controller adaptively readjusts the control signals for new <b>discharging</b> <b>power</b> references of PEVs.|$|R
50|$|As Lord Wilberforce notes, {{the issue}} {{with respect to the}} council is that it is <b>discharging</b> <b>powers</b> and duties as a matter of public and not private law.

30|$|We propose another {{approach}} which significantly reduces the computational load of the V 2 G operation while providing a competitive peak shaving performance. The approach {{consists of two}} stages: off-line and on-line processing. The desired level of loading after peak shaving and the time period for V 2 G service are first determined. These parameters depend only on the load profile characteristic and can be forecasted off-line. Then, the <b>discharging</b> <b>power</b> rates for PEVs connected to the grid are simultaneously determined. As the load profile varies with time, discharging PEVs at variable rates by considering the peak load level and the available capacities of PEVs would be more effective. Therefore, the <b>discharging</b> <b>power</b> rates for each PEV in V 2 G service are updated adaptively whenever a new PEV {{is connected to the}} grid for V 2 G service.|$|R
