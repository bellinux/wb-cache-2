This came as a {{contrast}} to the louder, more vocal Powderfinger work he was accustomed to. [...] "Watch Over Me", released and promoted in support of Australian charity Youngcare, {{was one of the}} slowest and most emotional songs on the album—The Ages Daniel Ziffer described it as [...] "emotionally wrenching". It was written alongside [...] "Believe" [...] following the 2005 Big Day Out. Sometimes construed as a relationships-based song, [...] "Watch Over Me" [...] was written by Fanning after watching Pope John Paul II's funeral.

[...] "I fell apart with the idea of touring", Ward later said. [...] "I <b>got</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> fear behind touring, I didn't talk about the fear, I drank behind the fear instead and that was a big mistake." [...] Ward was replaced by former Electric Light Orchestra drummer Bev Bevan for the Born Again '83 -'84 world tour, (often unofficially referred to as the 'Feigh Death Sabbath '83 – '84' World Tour) which began in Europe with Diamond Head, and later in the US with Quiet Riot and Night Ranger. The band headlined the 1983 Reading Festival in England, adding the Deep Purple song [...] "Smoke on the Water" [...] to their set list.|$|E
500|$|When Lavigne first gained publicity, she {{was known}} for her tomboyish style, in {{particular}} her necktie-and-tank-top combinations. She preferred baggy clothes, skater shoes or Converses, wristbands, and sometimes shoelaces wrapped around her fingers. During photo shoots, instead of wearing [...] "glittery get-ups", she preferred wearing [...] "old, crumpled T's". In response to her fashion and musical influences, the media called her the [...] "pop punk princess" [...] and the female answer to Blink-182. Press and fans regarded her as the [...] "anti-Britney", {{in part because of}} her less commercial and [...] "real" [...] image, but also because she was noticeably headstrong. [...] "I'm not made up and I'm not being told what to say and how to act, so they have to call me the anti-Britney, which I'm not." [...] By November 2002, however, Lavigne stopped wearing ties, claiming she felt she was [...] "wearing a costume". Lavigne made a conscious effort to keep her music, and not her image, at the forefront of her career. [...] "I'm just saying, I don't want to sell sex. I feel that's sort of lame and low.

500|$|In June 2009, Bono {{said that}} {{although}} the group had nine pieces of music they considered worth pursuing, the album would only be released if its quality surpassed that of No Line on the Horizon. In September, he first made claims that U2 were working on three separate album projects: a [...] "rocking club album" [...] comprising material the group previously wrote with producer Rick Rubin but shelved; the songs {{that he and the}} Edge had written for Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark; and Songs of Ascent. Bassist Adam Clayton was sceptical about Bono's statements, believing their material to still be in its infancy, while the Edge said he was not sure if the Spider-Man songs would be released as a U2 album or a cast recording, adding: [...] "The Spider-Man collection is the most developed but the least appropriate to the band. We've <b>got</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> material at different stages of completion, it's going to be a nice problem when we've got a few weeks to look at it." [...] After the band performed at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin in November, Bono and the Edge traveled to the South of France for a two-week songwriting session, followed by a studio session in New York City in December.|$|E

500|$|B'Day {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 70, based on 23 reviews. Jody Rosen, writing for Entertainment Weekly, {{commented that the}} album's songs [...] "arrive in huge gusts of rhythm and emotion, with Beyoncé's voice rippling over clattery beats". Jonah Weiner of Blender commented that [...] "sweaty up-tempo numbers prove the best platform for Beyoncé's rapperly phrasing and pipe-flaunting fireballs". Andy Kellman of Allmusic felt that, despite [...] "no songs with the smooth elegance" [...] of [...] "Me, Myself and I" [...] or [...] "Be with You", the album is [...] "lean in a beneficial way". The Boston Globes Sarah Rodman commented that the production team helped Beyoncé [...] "focus on edgier, up-tempo tracks that take her sweet soprano to new places". Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian felt that, [...] "apart from a few pop-R space-fillers, there's not much to dislike about B'Day". Robert Christgau from MSN Music said [...] "on most of [...] she's wronged yet still in control because she's <b>got</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> money" [...] and felt that Beyoncé [...] "earns her props" [...] if [...] "opulence can signify liberation in this grotesquely materialistic time, as in hip-hop it can".|$|E
500|$|Released on May 16, 1966, early {{reviews for}} the album in the U.S. ranged from {{negative}} to tentatively positive, and its sales numbered approximately 500,000 units, a significant drop-off from {{the run of}} million-selling albums that immediately preceded it. [...] It was assumed that Capitol considered Pet Sounds a risk, appealing more to an older demographic than the younger, female audience upon which the Beach Boys had built their commercial standing. Within two months, the label capitulated by releasing the group's first greatest hits compilation, Best of the Beach Boys, which was quickly certified gold by the RIAA. By contrast, Pet Sounds met a highly favorable critical response in Britain, where it reached number 2 and remained among the top-ten positions for six months. It was aided by support from the British music industry, who embraced the record. Bruce Johnston claimed that Pet Sounds <b>got</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> publicity, [...] "it forced EMI to put the album out sooner." [...] On July 30, Melody Maker ran a feature in which many pop musicians were asked whether they believed that Pet Sounds was truly as revolutionary or progressive as it was hyped to be. While the author concluded that [...] "the record's impact on artists and the men behind the artists has been considerable," [...] three of the nine people quoted (Manfred Mann's Michael D'Abo, the Walker Brothers' Scott Walker, and journalist Barry Fantoni) each expressed a preference for the Beach Boys' earlier work.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Paul Hunter, known {{for his work on}} previous Michael Jackson and TLC clips. However, for unknown reasons, the video was scrapped, and Hilson re-shot a clip for the video with [...] "Knock You Down" [...] and [...] "Number One" [...] director Chris Robinson. Robinson told Rap-Up, [...] "Keri Hilson has a great personality and is a real girl. That’s what we want to get across." [...] He also talked about the premise and plot of the video, stating that the video portrays Hilson as a woman who doesn't take herself seriously, commenting, [...] "It’s a really sexy song, but we don’t want to fall into the typical love, love, love R vibe with that... it starts where you think, ‘Oh, it’s about her and being sexy.' She’s in her house and by herself, and you kind of think it could be serious, but the song drops out in the middle and her friends catch her being all sexy, basically like, ‘What the f**k [...] are you doing? You are not singing by yourself.’" [...] In an interview with That Grape Juice, when asked about the video and on the sensuality of the live performances compared to video, Hilson responded, [...] "Yeah. It is a bit of that, but it’s a bit toned down for the video, because you <b>got</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> censoring, I can’t do everything I do on stage (laughs). So when people come out they’re probably still gonna be a bit surprised to see it live, after seeing the video. But I’m very pleased with the video. I love the colours and it’s reminiscent of the whole late 70s early 80s era in music." [...] Chris Brown, Omarion, Monica, Melody Thornton, and Polow Da Don all appear in the video. The video begins with Hilson, dressed lavishly, arriving late to a Jeep full of the previous stated people. The clip flips back to what happened earlier that night, showing Hilson getting ready in a seductive fashion, as she chooses perfume and picks out clothes. Scenes of Hilson performing in front of a leather-like wall are interspersed in between her and her friends riding down a boulevard to the club. Once she arrives to the club, she is attracted to a particular man, and subsequently performs elaborate, sensual choreography with him and other dancers, before slow dancing. VIBE said, [...] "Keri Hilson is fine as wine. You know it. We know it. And she knows it. But for the doubters, she proves it once again with this seductive new video from In A Perfect World." [...] A writer for Rap-Up said that Hilson, [...] "takes it nice and slow in the video for 'Slow Dance.'" [...] The video ranked at number 80 on [...] Top 100 Videos of 2009 countdown.|$|E

He further elaborated by saying that [...] "In the film the character knows martial arts, so Okada studied hard. He <b>got</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> into it that he became a shihan [...]".

Zinedine Zidane also praised Iniesta, stating on the Spanish radio station Cadena COPE, [...] "Iniesta really impresses me. He's <b>got</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> influence in Spain's game. He reminds me of myself." [...] Fernando Torres, Spain's striker, said, [...] "We've been playing together since we were 15 and I have never, ever seen him play badly."

2500|$|The album's {{greatest}} {{success was}} in the UK, where it reached number 2 and stayed in the top-ten positions for six months. It was aided by support from the British music industry, who embraced the record. Bruce Johnston stated {{that when he was}} in London in May 1966, a number of musicians and other guests gathered in his hotel suite to listen to repeated playbacks of the album. This included John Lennon, Paul McCartney and Keith Moon. Moon himself involved Johnston by helping him gain coverage in British television circuits, and connecting him with Lennon and McCartney. Johnston claimed that Pet Sounds <b>got</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> publicity, [...] "it forced EMI to put the album out sooner." [...] The Beach Boys became the strongest selling album act in the UK for the final quarter of 1966, dethroning the three-year reign of native bands such as the Beatles.|$|E

Furthermore, Pepys was not among the {{group of people who}} were most at risk. He did not live in cramped housing, he did not routinely mix with the poor, and he was not required to keep his family in London {{in the event of a}} crisis. It was not until June 1665 that the unusual seriousness of the plague became apparent, so Pepys's activities in the first five months of 1665 were not significantly affected by it. Indeed, Claire Tomalin writes that [...] "the most notable fact about Pepys's plague year is that to him it was one of the happiest of his life." [...] In 1665, he worked very hard, and the outcome was that he quadrupled his fortune. In his annual summary on 31 December, he wrote, [...] "I have never lived so merrily (besides that I never <b>got</b> <b>so</b> <b>much)</b> as I have done this plague time". Nonetheless, Pepys was certainly concerned about the plague. On 16 August he wrote: ...|$|E

Tony Blackburn who presented the very first BBC Radio One morning show had previously presented the same morning show on Radio Caroline and later on Big L. He attempted to duplicate the same sound for BBC Radio One. Among the other DJs hired was the late John Peel who had presented the overnight show on [...] "Big L", called The Perfumed Garden. Though it only ran for a few months prior to Big L's closure, The Perfumed Garden got more fan mail {{than the rest of the}} pop DJ's on Radio London put together, so much that staff wondered what to do with it all. The reason it <b>got</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> mail was that it played different music, and was the beginning of the [...] "album rock" [...] genre.

Naomi Watts commented that the atmosphere [...] "felt emblematic of how it feels onstageat least my long-time memories from long ago". Andrea Riseborough, meanwhile, described the process as [...] "wonderful", mentioning how it was possible to hear the filming of a sequence from far away before the camera arrived and then [...] "the magic happens with you, and then everything leaves you, and everything's silent". Once they successfully completed a take though, it was obvious to everybody involved.
