25|$|The first {{synthesis}} of atorvastatin at Parke-Davis {{that occurred during}} drug discovery was racemic followed by chiral chromatographic separation of the enantiomers. An early enantioselective route to atorvastatin made use of an ester chiral auxiliary to set the stereochemistry {{of the first of}} the two alcohol functional groups via a diastereoselective aldol reaction. Once the compound entered pre-clinical development, process chemistry developed a cost-effective and scalable synthesis. In atorvastatin's case, a key element of the overall synthesis was ensuring stereochemical purity in the final drug substance, and hence establishing the first stereocenter became a key aspect of the overall design. The final commercial production of atorvastatin relied on a chiral pool approach, where the stereochemistry of the first alcohol functional group was carried into the synthesis—through the choice of <b>isoascorbic</b> <b>acid,</b> an inexpensive and easily sourced plant-derived natural product.|$|E

40|$|We {{show here}} that cultured neonatal-rabbit aortic smooth-muscle cells produce and {{accumulate}} {{significant amounts of}} insoluble elastin. When grown {{in the presence of}} ascorbic acid, the amount of insoluble elastin in these cultures decreases, whereas the accumulation of collagen increases. These changes have been attributed to increased hydroxylation of proline in elastin. The function of ascorbic acid in proline hydroxylation is thought to be that of a reductive cofactor that maintains the proper oxidation state of molecular iron in the enzyme complex. This study shows that both ascorbic and <b>isoascorbic</b> <b>acids</b> act similarly to modify the accumulation of elastin and collagen in culture. On the other hand, cultures grown in the presence of dithiothreitol, a reducing agent previously shown to act as a cofactor for prolyl hydroxylase, do not demonstrate altered elastin accumulation. These studies are consistent with the suggestion that there is a specific role for ascorbic acid in this cellular system that cannot be replaced by other reducing cofactors...|$|R

40|$|Objective To {{establish}} a high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for simultaneous {{determination of the}} contents of ascorbic acid and <b>isoascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> in food. Methods Ascorbic acid and <b>isoascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> were separated using a Venusil HILIC column (250 mm× 4. 6 mm, 5 μm, 100 ?), taking acetonitrile- 0. 1 % phosphoric acid solution (90 ∶ 10, v/v) as the mobile phase and extractant. Results The average recoveries of ascorbic acid and <b>isoascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> were 96. 61 % and 96. 53 %. And their minimum detectable concentration was 0. 35 μg/mL and 0. 42 μg/mL.

The kinetic inactivation and emission deactivation of alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes present also striking similarities. The fluorescence modifications, moreover, show a particular pattern, indicative of a transition phenomenon. The quenching effects displayed by the ascorbic system on alkaline phosphatase can then supply an interesting insight into {{other aspects of the}} inhibitor-enzyme interaction...|$|E

It had been classified as gen-erally recognized as safe (GRAS) additives by US Food and water. However, its highly hydrophilic behavior similar with ascorbic acid prevents its application in cosmetics or fats and oils-based foods [3]. Esterification process of converting ascorbic acid to its acid esters has been regarded as an effective solution for overcoming such problems. Fur-thermore, the esterified ascorbic acid products also have bi-functional activity including its original antioxidant activity and the bioactivity of the connected group.

40|$|Antibrowning {{activities}} of Morus alba L. twig extracts, oxyresveratrol, and mulberroside A isolated from mulberry twig on cloudy apple juices and fresh-cut apple slices {{were evaluated by}} monitoring the change of a* value, total color difference (ΔE), and visual observation. It was found, similar to 4 -hexylresorcinol, that oxyresveratrol could effectively inhibit browning in cloudy apple juices at a concentration as low as 0. 01 % and that mulberry twig extract also showed remarkable antibrowning effects on cloudy apple juices. However, for fresh-cut apples slices, mulberry twig extract and oxyresveratrol needed {{to be used in}} combination at least with ascorbic acid to exhibit their antibrowning effects. Apple slice samples treated by dipping in a solution containing 0. 001 M oxyresveratrol, 0. 5 M <b>isoascorbic</b> <b>acid,</b> 0. 05 M calcium chloride, and 0. 025 M acetylcysteine did not undergo any substantial browning reaction for 28 days at 4 °C.

40|$|We {{describe}} here {{a simple}} and rapid capillary electrophoresis method for the determination of ascorbic acid (L-AA) and <b>isoascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> (D-AA) in vegetative tissues. For optimal yields and stabilization, samples are extracted with cold 3 % metaphosphoric acid. Hydrophobic contaminants are then removed by passage through a C- 18 solid-phase extraction cartridge. The analysis itself is performed on a fused silica capillary with 200 mM berate, pH 9, as the carrier electrolyte, using on-line diode array detection over the range 190 - 350 nm. Quantitation was performed at 260 nm, the uv-absorption maximum for ascorbate at this pH. This method has a minimum detection Limit of 84 fmol/injection and linearity of detector response was observed up to at least 12 pmol/injection. We also describe the influence of electrolyte concentration, pH, {{and the presence of}} detergent on separations of L-AA, D-AA, and L-galacturonic acid- 1, 4 -lactone. The protocol has been demonstrated to be suitable for the analysis of L-AA in Arabidopsis, parsley, and mushroom. The method has superior resolution to comparable HPLC separations, a comparable analysis time, but lower sensitivity because of the concentration limitations of the detection system.

40|$|A redox {{initiating}} system, {{consisting of}} t-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHPO), <b>isoascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> (iAA), and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ferric-sodium salt (FeEDTA) was employed in emulsion polymerizations of methyl methacrylate (MMA) at high solids contents of 30 wt % in water. The system was stabilized using, linoleic acid (LA) -functionalized and nonfunctionalized surfactants based on methoxy-PEG (MPEG) and epsilon-caprolactone (CL). To optimize polymerization conditions {{and to avoid}} coagulation and solidification during the reaction, the temperature, the amount of initiator, the chemical characteristics of the surfactant, and the surfactant to monomer ratio were varied. MPEO(45) -CL(6. 5) -LA (the subscripts refer to {{the average number of}} repeating monomer units) was found to be the most suitable surfactant, as it performs adequately under suboptimal reaction conditions. In the emulsion polymerization of MMA in water at similar to 30 wt %, best results were obtained at a reaction temperature of 60 degrees C, with an initiator system comprising tBHPO iAA and FeEDTA, and a surfactant to monomer ratio of 10 / 90 by weight or higher. Under these conditions, stable PMMA latices with average particle sizes of 200 - 300 nm were obtained at complete monomer conversion. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|We {{examined}} the effects of L-ascorbic acid and its analogues onDNA synthesis and cell proliferation. We also investigated the signaltransduction pathways involved in the induction of mitogenesis byL-ascorbic acid and its analogues using primary cultures of adult rathepatocytes. Following a 4 -h serum-free cultivation, both L-ascorbic acidand its stable analogue, L-ascorbic acid 2 -glucoside, time- anddose-dependently stimulated hepatocyte DNA synthesis and cellproliferation, with EC 50 values of 6. 46 ? 10 - 8 M and 3. 34 ? 10 - 8 M,respectively. Dehydroascorbic acid (10 - 6 M - 10 - 5 M) weakly stimulatedhepatocyte mitogenesis, whereas <b>isoascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> (10 - 9 M ? 10 - 5 M) had noeffect. Hepatocyte mitogenesis induced by L-ascorbic acid or L-ascorbic acid 2 -glucoside was dose-dependently abolished by treatment with monoclonalantibodies against insulin-like growth factor (IGF) -I receptor, but not bytreatment with monoclonal antibodies against insulin receptor or IGF-IIreceptor. Western blot analysis showed that both L-ascorbic acid andL-ascorbic acid 2 -glucoside significantly stimulated IFG-I receptor tyrosinekinase activity within 3 min, and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinaseactivity within 5 min. These results demonstrate that both L-ascorbic acidand L-ascorbic acid 2 -glucoside induce DNA synthesis and cell proliferationin primary cultures of adult rat hepatocytes by interacting with the IGF-Ireceptor site and by activating the receptor tyrosine kinase/MAP kinasepathway...|$|E
40|$|Monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR; EC 1. 6. 5. 4) is an {{important}} enzyme for ascorbate recycling. To examine whether heterologous expression of MDHAR from Oryza sativa (OsMDHAR) can prevent the deleterious effects of unfavorable growth conditions, we constructed a transgenic yeast strain harboring a recombinant plasmid carrying OsMDHAR (p 426 GPD::OsMDHAR). OsMDHAR-expressing yeast cells displayed enhanced tolerance to hydrogen peroxide by maintaining redox homoeostasis, proteostasis, and the ascorbate (AsA) -like pool following the accumulation of antioxidant enzymes and molecules, metabolic enzymes, and molecular chaperones and their cofactors, compared to wild-type (WT) cells carrying vector alone. The addition of exogenous AsA or its analogue <b>isoascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> increased the viability of WT and ara 2 Δ cells under oxidative stress. Furthermore, the survival of OsMDHAR-expressing cells was {{greater than that of}} WT cells when cells at mid-log growth phase were exposed to high concentrations of ethanol. High OsMDHAR expression also improved the fermentative capacity of the yeast during glucose-based batch fermentation at a standard cultivation temperature (30 °C). The alcohol yield of OsMDHAR-expressing transgenic yeast during fermentation was approximately 25 % (0. 18 g·g- 1) higher than that of WT yeast. Accordingly, OsMDHAR-expressing transgenic yeast showed prolonged survival during the environmental stresses produced during fermentation. These results suggest that heterologous OsMDHAR expression increases tolerance to reactive oxygen species-induced oxidative stress by improving cellular redox homeostasis and improves survival during fermentation, which enhances fermentative capacity...|$|E
40|$|The {{dehydrogenase}} {{activity of}} dimeric dihydrodiol dehydrogenases (DD) purified from pig and rabbit lenses was inhibited by either L-ascorbic acid or its epimer, <b>isoascorbic</b> <b>acid,</b> at pH 7. 5. Isoascorbate [IC 50 (concn. giving 50 % inhibition) = 0. 043 mM for the pig enzyme; IC 50 = 0. 13 mM for the rabbit enzyme] {{was a more}} potent inhibitor than ascorbate (IC 50 values 0. 45 and 0. 90 mM respectively), but 1 mM-dehydroascorbate gave less than 30 % inhibition. Glucose, glucuronate, gulono-gamma-lactone, glutathione and dithiothreitol did not inhibit the enzyme activity. The inhibition by isoascorbate and ascorbate was instantaneous and reversible, and their inhibitory potency was decreased by addition of ascorbate oxidase. In the reverse reaction, isoascorbate and ascorbate gave low IC 50 values of 0. 013 and 0. 10 mM respectively for the pig enzyme and 0. 025 and 0. 25 mM for the rabbit enzyme. The inhibition patterns by the two compounds were competitive with respect to dihydrodiols of naphthalene and benzene and uncompetitive with respect to NADP+, but those in the reverse reaction were uncompetitive with respect to both carbonyl substrate and NADPH. The steady-state kinetic measurements in the forward and reverse reactions by the pig enzyme were consistent with an ordered Bi Bi mechanism, in which NADP+ binds to the enzyme first and NADPH leaves last. The results indicate that ascorbate and its epimer directly bind to an enzyme: NADP+ binary complex as dead-end inhibitors. Thus ascorbate {{may be an important}} modulator of DD in the lens...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this dissertation was to study the disposition and absorption of riboflavin and ascorbic acid in healthy male subjects {{as a function of}} age. Deficiencies of these vitamins have been found in the elderly and malabsorption is suspected in this population. Absorption of riboflavin was examined by administration of an oral dose of 200 mg of riboflavin- 5 '-phosphate (FMN) and disposition was studied following a 30 min constant rate IV infusion of FMN equivalent to 25 mg of riboflavin. Ascorbic acid absorption was examined by administration of a 5 g oral dose and disposition was studied following a 1 g IV dose. Test doses of these vitamins were administered to subjects ranging in age from 33 to 85 years. High performance liquid chromatographic assays were developed for the determination of riboflavin and ascorbic acid in plasma and urine. The method for riboflavin separated FMN and flavin adenine dinucleotide under isocratic conditions. Quantification of the three flavins was achieved by fluorescence detection. The assay system for ascrobic acid used a postcolumn reaction for the fluorometric detection of a dehydroascorbic acid derivative. This method used <b>isoascorbic</b> <b>acid</b> as the internal standard. Finally, similar specificity between a "methoxyaniline" colorimetric method and the chromatographic method was observed for the quantification of ascorbic acid in plasma and urine. Albumin plasma concentration and riboflavin protein binding were decreased with age (p < 0. 05). The in vitro stability of ascorbic acid in whole blood and plasma decreased with age (p < 0. 05, n = 17). The results of this study indicate no age-related alterations in parameters associated with the gastrointestinal absorption of these vitamins. Increased relative renal excretion of riboflavin with age may explain the deficiency of this vitamin. On the other hand, ascorbic acid deficiency with age may be explained by decreased stability of the vitamin in blood...|$|E
