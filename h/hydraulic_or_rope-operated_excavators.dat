50|$|<b>Hydraulic</b> <b>or</b> {{air powered}} airless {{provide a more}} uniform {{pressure}} control since the paint piston moves at a constant speed except when it changes direction. In most direct drive piston pumps, the piston is crankshaft driven in which the piston will be constantly changing speed.

25|$|Cements used in {{construction}} are usually inorganic, often lime or calcium silicate based, {{and can be}} characterized as being either <b>hydraulic</b> <b>or</b> non-hydraulic, depending upon the ability of the cement to set in the presence of water (see hydraulic and non-hydraulic lime plaster).|$|R
5000|$|The {{contraction}} of the scissor action can be <b>hydraulic,</b> pneumatic <b>or</b> mechanical (via a leadscrew or {{rack and pinion}} system). Depending on the power system employed on the lift, it may require no power to enter [...] "descent" [...] mode, but rather a simple release of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>or</b> pneumatic pressure. This {{is the main reason}} that these methods of powering the lifts are preferred, as it allows a fail-safe option of returning the platform to the ground by release of a manual valve.|$|R
