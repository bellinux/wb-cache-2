This study analyzed hostile user statements against nursing professionals of Mental Health Services and <b>Emergency</b> <b>Units</b> in Health Service (MHS) hospitals in Murcia, Spain, and determined the frequency of exposure to the different violent user behaviors. The study was carried out with a sample of 518 nursing professionals from four hospital services: Mental Health, <b>Emergency</b> <b>Units,</b> Medical Hospitalization, and Maternal-and-Child. The nursing staff of Mental Health and <b>Emergency</b> <b>Units</b> was the most exposed to violence.

40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE To {{analyze the}} process of {{implementation}} of <b>emergency</b> care <b>units</b> in Brazil. METHODS We have carried out a documentary analysis, with interviews with twenty-four state urgency coordinators and a panel of experts. We have analyzed issues related to policy background and trajectory, players involved in the implementation, expansion process, advances, limits, and implementation difficulties, and state coordination capacity. We have used the theoretical framework of {{the analysis of the}} strategic conduct of the Giddens theory of structuration. RESULTS <b>Emergency</b> care <b>units</b> have been implemented after 2007, initially in the Southeast region, and 446 <b>emergency</b> care <b>units</b> were present in all Brazilian regions in 2016. Currently, 620 <b>emergency</b> care <b>units</b> are under construction, which indicates expectation of expansion. Federal funding was a strong driver for the implementation. The states have planned their <b>emergency</b> care <b>units,</b> but the existence of direct negotiation between municipalities and the Union has contributed with the significant number of <b>emergency</b> care <b>units</b> that have been built but that do not work. In relation to the urgency network, there is tension with the hospital {{because of the lack of}} beds in the country, which generates hospitalizations in the <b>emergency</b> care <b>unit.</b> The management of <b>emergency</b> care <b>units</b> is predominantly municipal, and most of the <b>emergency</b> care <b>units</b> are located outside the capitals and classified as Size III. The main challenges identified were: under-funding and difficulty in recruiting physicians. CONCLUSIONS The <b>emergency</b> care <b>unit</b> has the merit of having technological resources and being architecturally differentiated, but it will only succeed within an urgency network. Federal induction has generated contradictory responses, since not all states consider the <b>emergency</b> care <b>unit</b> a priority. The strengthening of the state management has been identified as a challenge for the implementation of the urgency network...|$|R

2500|$|The Port Authority Police Emergency Services Unit {{was founded}} in 1983, over the {{objections}} of the Port Authority Police management at that time. [...] Working with the non-police PATH railroad personnel and railroad management, who clearly recognized the need for a rapid response to PATH railroad emergencies and fires, a small group of Port Authority Police officers assigned to the PATH command asked for, and got, a stock Port Authority utility truck which was converted for police emergency use. Despite the continued objections of P.A. Police management, the PATH railroad management's goal of having an [...] "Emergency Response Vehicle" [...] operated by the police bore fruit. The initial team members were trained in underground rescue, extrication of passengers from PATH train cars and first aid, with emphasis on the procedure of lifting railroad cars from trapped persons by use of Vetter air bags.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} thrombolytic and acetylsalicylic acid therapies in acute myocardial infarct patients {{as well as the}} availability of technical and human resources for the care of these patients in the <b>emergency</b> <b>units</b> of the city of Rio de Janeiro. Additional objectives were the evaluation of the use of primary angioplasty and the level of acceptance of SBC /RJ as an entity responsible for programs of continued medical education. METHODS: Interviews with physicians at 46 <b>emergency</b> <b>units</b> in the city of Rio de Janeiro. RESULTS: Of the 46 <b>emergency</b> <b>units</b> inspected, a policy of encouragement to use thrombolytic therapy was only prescribed in 6. 5 %. In 1 / 3 of the public wards no thrombolytic agents were available, and in none of them was access to primary angioplasty regularly available; 45. 9 % did not offer the minimal conditions required for the handling of cases of acute myocardial infarction; 60 % of the physicians on-call (at both public and private <b>emergency</b> <b>units),</b> appeared not to know the importance of the use of acetylsalicylic acid in acute myocardial infarct patients; all physicians interviewed would participate in programs of continued medical education organized by the SBC/RJ. CONCLUSION: The study suggests there was: 1) the low probability of the use of thrombolytic therapy in the majority of the <b>emergency</b> <b>units</b> in of the city of Rio de Janeiro due to the inadequate policy of waiting for the transfer of the patient to coronary or intensive care unit; 2) a low awareness to the importance of early use of acetylsalic acid in acute myocardial infarct; 3) half of the <b>emergency</b> <b>units</b> of the public net do not have the minimal conditions required for the handling of cases of acute myocardial infarction; 4) a high level of credibility exists that would enable the SBC/RJ to set up programs for continued medical education to change the mentality regarding the use of thrombolytic therapy and of acetylsalicylic acid...|$|R
