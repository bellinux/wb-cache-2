5|$|A major {{point of}} {{consensus}} among all scholars of intellectual giftedness <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> generally agreed definition of giftedness. Although {{there is no}} scholarly agreement about identifying gifted learners, there is a de facto reliance on IQ scores for identifying participants in school gifted education programs. In practice, many {{school districts in the}} United States use an IQ score of 130, including about the upper 2 or 3 percent of the national population, as a cut-off score for inclusion in school gifted programs.|$|E
5|$|Because the hot recycle solids are heated in a {{separate}} furnace, the oil shale gas from these technologies is not diluted with combustion exhaust gas. Another advantage <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> limit on the smallest particles that the retort can process, thus allowing all the crushed feed to be used. One disadvantge is that more water is used to handle the resulting finer shale ash.|$|E

5|$|A further {{suggestion}} is that Mari Lwyd derives from the English term Merry Lude, referring to a merry game. Peate opposed this idea, arguing that if the latter was converted into Welsh then {{the result would be}} merri-liwt or merri-liwd. Peate also dismissed the idea that had been suggested to him that the term Mari in this context had derived from Morris, a reference to Morris dance. Another reason to doubt this idea <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> known historical link between the Mari Lwyd, which was found in South Wales, and the Morris dance, which was concentrated in the north of the country.|$|E
5|$|Here the key {{difference}} to notice <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> surface {{tension between the}} solid and the vapor for the second surface tension component. This {{is because of the}} assumption that the surface of air that is exposed is under the droplet and is the only other substrate in the system. Subsequently, the equation is then expressed as (1 – f). Therefore, the Cassie equation can be easily derived from the Cassie–Baxter equation. Experimental results regarding the surface properties of Wenzel versus Cassie–Baxter systems showed the effect of pinning for a Young angle of 180 to 90°, a region classified under the Cassie–Baxter model. This liquid/air composite system is largely hydrophobic. After that point, a sharp transition to the Wenzel regime was found where the drop wets the surface, but no further than edges of the drop.|$|E
5|$|Non-dental {{sources of}} pain often cause {{multiple}} teeth to hurt {{and have an}} epicenter that is either above or below the jaws. For instance, cardiac pain (which can make the bottom teeth hurt) usually radiates up from the chest and neck, and sinusitis (which can make the back top teeth hurt) is worsened by bending over. As all of these conditions may mimic toothache, {{it is possible that}} dental treatment, such as fillings, root canal treatment, or tooth extraction may be carried out unnecessarily by dentists in an attempt to relieve the individual's pain, and as a result the correct diagnosis is delayed. A hallmark <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> obvious dental cause, and signs and symptoms elsewhere in the body may be present. As migraines are typically present for many years, the diagnosis is easier to make. Often the character of the pain is the differentiator between dental and non-dental pain.|$|E

5|$|Paralympic {{wheelchair}} curling {{is played}} {{according to the}} rules of the World Curling Federation, the only modification <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> sweeping. The sport was open to both male and female athletes who competed in mixed teams, with a requirement that each team had at least one member of each sex. The format was a round-robin tournament; each nation played all others in a group stage with the top four qualifying for medal playoffs. Britain won their group games against the teams from Denmark, Sweden, Italy and the United States, and lost the matches against Switzerland, Norway and Canada. Their record of four wins and three loses meant they finished the group stage in second place and advanced directly to the medal rounds. In the first end of the semi-final, against Sweden, Britain stole three and {{went on to win the}} match 7–3. In the final the team faced Canada. Trailing 6–3 in the final end skip Frank Duffy had an opportunity, with the last stone of the tournament for an open hit of a Canadian stone. If successful he would have scored four for Britain and won them the gold medal but he threw too hard and the shot tracked an inch wide. This meant that Canada scored one to win 7–4, leaving the British team as silver medallists.|$|E
5|$|The abundances of {{the noble}} {{gases in the}} {{universe}} decrease as their atomic numbers increase. Helium {{is the most common}} element in the universe after hydrogen, with a mass fraction of about 24%. Most of the helium in the universe was formed during Big Bang nucleosynthesis, but the amount of helium is steadily increasing due to the fusion of hydrogen in stellar nucleosynthesis (and, to a very slight degree, the alpha decay of heavy elements). Abundances on Earth follow different trends; for example, helium is only the third most abundant noble gas in the atmosphere. The reason <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> primordial helium in the atmosphere; due to the small mass of the atom, helium cannot be retained by the Earth's gravitational field. Helium on Earth comes from the alpha decay of heavy elements such as uranium and thorium found in the Earth's crust, and tends to accumulate in natural gas deposits. The abundance of argon, on the other hand, is increased {{as a result of the}} beta decay of potassium-40, also found in the Earth's crust, to form argon-40, which is the most abundant isotope of argon on Earth despite being relatively rare in the Solar System. This process is the basis for the potassium-argon dating method.Ar/39Ar dating and errors|accessdate=2008-06-26|publisher=Technische Universität Bergakademie Freiberg|date=2007-01-16|last=Scherer|first=Alexandra |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071014042248/http://geoberg.de/text/geology/07011601.php |archivedate=2007-10-14}} Xenon has an unexpectedly low abundance in the atmosphere, in what has been called the missing xenon problem; one theory is that the missing xenon may be trapped in minerals inside the Earth's crust. After the discovery of xenon dioxide, research showed that Xe can substitute for Si in quartz. Radon is formed in the lithosphere by the alpha decay of radium. It can seep into buildings through cracks in their foundation and accumulate in areas that are not well ventilated. Due to its high radioactivity, radon presents a significant health hazard; it is implicated in an estimated 21,000 lung cancer deaths per year in the United States alone.|$|E
25|$|In the past, {{there have}} been speculations about {{possible}} complications after transient synovitis. The current consensus however <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> proof of {{an increased risk of}} complications after transient synovitis.|$|E

25|$|Standard Heckscher–Ohlin theory {{assumes the}} same {{production}} function for all countries. This implies that all firms are identical.

25|$|The {{position}} {{of the scientific community}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> controversy to teach, that evolution is widely accepted within the scientific community as a valid, well-supported theory and that such disagreements that do exist are about the details of evolution's mechanisms, not the validity of evolution itself.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{advantage}} of a hermetic and semi-hermetic <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> route for the gas to leak out of the system.

25|$|Prohibition of {{generalized}} grievances: A plaintiff cannot sue if {{the injury}} is widely shared in an undifferentiated way with many people. For example, {{the general rule}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> federal taxpayer standing, as complaints about the spending of federal funds are too remote from the process of acquiring them. Such grievances are ordinarily more appropriately addressed in the representative branches.|$|E
25|$|The unique {{advantage}} of ironless DC motors <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> cogging (torque variations caused by changing attraction between the iron and the magnets). Parasitic eddy currents cannot {{form in the}} rotor as it is totally ironless, although iron rotors are laminated. This can greatly improve efficiency, but variable-speed controllers must use a higher switching rate (>40kHz) or DC because of the decreased electromagnetic induction.|$|E
25|$|The main {{belief of}} the NOI and its {{followers}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> other God but Allah. They teach that their founder, Master Fard Muhammad is the Mahdi.

25|$|The computable numbers may {{be viewed}} as the real numbers that may be exactly {{represented}} in a computer: a computable number is exactly represented by its first digits and a program for computing further digits. However, the computable numbers are rarely used in practice. One reason <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> algorithm for testing the equality of two computable numbers. More precisely, there cannot exist any algorithm which takes any computable number as an input, and decides in every case if this number is equal to zero or not.|$|E
25|$|Conversion, being a {{wrongful}} act, cannot {{spring from}} the exercise of a legal right. Such acts include the right of execution on a legal judgment or contesting rights under a contract. The general rule <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> conversion until some act is done which is a denial or violation of the plaintiff's dominion over or rights in the property. To constitute a conversion of a chattel, {{there must be an}} unauthorized assumption of the right to possession or ownership. The act must have the essence of a tort.|$|E
