50|$|In the European Union, since 1974 all {{new cars}} {{have had to}} conform to a European {{directive}} on vehicle <b>exterior</b> <b>projections.</b> Rolls Royce's mascot is now mounted on a spring-loaded mechanism designed to retract instantly into the radiator shell if struck with more than 10 kg of force. The Mercedes-Benz and many other ornaments were designed with a spring mount to fold on impact. For aftermarket ornaments, breakaway nylon fixings are available that comply with EC Directive 74/483.|$|E

5000|$|Founded with David John Attyah, THINK AGAIN (1997-present) is an artist-activist {{collaborative}} that recruits art-making in {{the service}} of public address. Their work -- digital murals, billboards and wallscapes, <b>exterior</b> <b>projections,</b> and viral poster campaigns -- links the global to the local and combines cultural theory, sociological research, and activism to create a visual language for engaging civic dialogue. THINK AGAIN projects have explored a unique range of issues including the logic of militarization; international labor and the treatment of immigrants; gentrification and displacement; representations of queers in the media; and the ways capitalism and misogyny conspire to jeopardize women. website: http://www.agitart.org ...|$|E

25|$|Evolving {{from the}} renaissance style, the baroque style was most notably {{experienced}} in religious art and architecture. Most architectural historians regard Michelangelo's design of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome as {{a precursor to}} the Baroque style. Baroque style can be recognized by broader interior spaces (replacing long narrow naves), more playful attention to light and shadow, extensive ornamentation, large frescoes, focus on interior art, and frequently, a dramatic central <b>exterior</b> <b>projection.</b> The most important early example of the baroque period was the Santa Susanna by Carlo Maderno. Saint Paul's Cathedral in London by Christopher Wren {{is regarded as the}} prime example of the rather late influence of the Baroque style in England.|$|R
50|$|Pope Sixtus V {{appointed}} Giacomo della Porta and Domenico Fontana in 1588 {{to begin}} {{construction of the}} dome of St. Peter's Basilica to Michelangelo's model. They made modifications to his design estimated to have reduced the tensile stresses in the dome by 40%, including thinning the two shells near the top, reducing the thickness and <b>exterior</b> <b>projection</b> of the ribs, raising the springing line by 4.8 meters, and changing {{the shape of the}} dome. Giacomo della Porta insisted on a vertically elliptical profile for the dome of St. Peter's Basilica, for structural reasons, and construction began in June 1588. The dome was completed up {{to the base of the}} lantern in May 1590, a few months before the death of Pope Sixtus V. The lantern and lead covering for the dome were completed later, with the brass orb and cross being raised in 1592.|$|R

40|$|Cultural {{diplomacy}} is usually {{defined as an}} artistic and intellectual exchanges policy developed within Nation-States. During {{the last three decades}} we saw the proliferation of diverse external cultural policies structures of subnational governments all around the world. This can be explained because of the restructuration of postfordist State, the appearance of new actors and the development of multiple schemes of multilevel governance. However, the rupture of central governments monopoly in the area supposes a challenge for the development of new representation systems of States abroad. In Spain case, the significant decentralization of public administration since democratic transition permitted the emergence of cultural paradiplomacies of autonomic governments. This work analyses this process by studying the cases of General Administration of State and Catalan Autonomic Community and seek to explain how the abroad cultural action of the State of Autonomies is configured. In this regard, this article shows the inexistence of a federal system of cultural diplomacy. By contrast, it demonstrates the presence of an ntergovernmental competition in which processes of nation building are opposed and where legitimacy and monopoly of <b>exterior</b> cultural <b>projection</b> are on debat...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the recently developed mixed mimetic spectral element method for the Stokes {{problem in the}} vorticity-velocity-pressure formulation. This compatible discretization method relies {{on the construction of}} a conforming discrete Hodge decomposition, that is based on a bounded projection operator that commutes with the <b>exterior</b> derivative. The <b>projection</b> operator is the composition of a reduction and a reconstruction step. The reconstruction in terms of mimetic spectral element basis-functions are tensor-based constructions and therefore hold for curvilinear quadrilateral and hexahedral meshes. For compatible discretization methods that contain a conforming discrete Hodge decomposition, we derive optimal a priori error estimates which are valid for all admissible boundary conditions on both Cartesian and curvilinear meshes. These theoretical results are confirmed by numerical experiments. These clearly show that the mimetic spectral elements outperform the commonly used H(div) -compatible Raviart-Thomas elements...|$|R
40|$|Autonomous {{vehicles}} {{will have to}} coordinate their behavior with human road users such as drivers and pedestrians. The majority of recently proposed solutions for autonomous vehicle-to-human communication consist of introducing additional visual cues (such as lights, text and pictograms) on either the car’s <b>exterior</b> or as <b>projections</b> on the road. We argue that potential shortcomings in the visibility (due to light conditions, placement on the vehicle) and immediate understandability (learned, directive) {{of many of these}} cues make them alone insufficient in mediating multi-party interactions in the busy intersections of day-to-day traffic. Our observations of real-world human road user behavior in urban intersections indicate that movement in context is a central method of communication for coordination among drivers and pedestrians. The observed movement patterns gain meaning when seen within the context of road geometry, current road activity, and culture. While all movement communicates the intention of the driver, we highlight the use of movement as gesture, done for the specific purpose of communicating to other road users and give examples of how these influence traffic interactions. An awareness and understanding of the effect and importance of movement gestures in day-to-day traffic interactions is needed for developers of autonomous vehicles to design forms of human-vehicle communication that are effective and scalable in multi-party interactions...|$|R
40|$|Madrid; a city {{shrouded}} in history, culture and tradition. The streets, alive with {{a myriad of}} stalls, vibrant patterns and bustling café’s on each corner, draw the Spanish people out into the courtyards of the city. ‘El Cine Madrid’ seeks to continue the spirit of this outdoor street culture by engaging the public with its grand, monumental entrance, its glistening, shiny <b>exterior,</b> the demystifying <b>projection</b> booths visible from outside and its forest of red columns that soar majestically through the air. The two cinemas, clad in lightweight aluminium, float well above the ground surface like aeroplanes floating on clouds. As the Spanish sun sets over the city, the cinemas illuminate, enticing passers-by to enter. For two hours, viewers are transported to another time, place and dimension where they can escape from reality, relax and be entertained. ‘El Cine Madrid’ prides itself on providing viewers with a unique experience as {{they make their way}} into the theatre. The broad, generous stairs at the front draw people in to experience the spatial qualities of the building. As you make your way up the stairs and ramp, the light begins to dim as the sloping floor of the cinema above closes in on you. Moving past the first cinema, you are drawn to a second doorway that leads you under the second cinema. As you walk through, the light increases, affording another brilliant view of Madrid. As a group of viewers in the cinemas up above indulge in a variety of films, down below on street level, talented performers entertain large crowds in the forest of red columns, as they delight in a range of snacks and drinks served from traditional carts and trolleys. ‘El Cine Madrid’ embraces the historic street culture of Madrid and melts into the urban landscape to provide the Spanish people with another courtyard to celebrate in.
