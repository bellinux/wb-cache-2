5|$|In a 2015 study, {{high-quality}} genome sequences {{from three}} Asian elephants and two woolly mammoths were compared. Approximately 1.4 million DNA nucleotide <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>between</b> mammoths and elephants, which affect {{the sequence of}} more than 1,600 proteins. Differences were noted in genes {{for a number of}} aspects of physiology and biology that would be relevant to Arctic survival, including development of skin and hair, storage and metabolism of adipose tissue, and perceiving temperature. Genes related to both sensing temperature and transmitting that sensation to the brain were altered. One of the heat-sensing genes encodes a protein, TRPV3, found in skin which also affects hair growth. When inserted into human cells, the mammoth's version of the protein was found to be less sensitive to heat than the elephant's. This is consistent with a previous observation that mice lacking active TRPV3 are likely to spend more time in cooler cage locations than wild type mice, and have wavier hair. There were also several alterations in circadian clock genes, perhaps needed to cope with the extreme polar variation in length of daylight. Similar mutations are known in other Arctic mammals, such as reindeer.|$|E

While later studies conducted in Netherlands, Italy, and Spain produced similar results to the first studies, the question of whether social sharing exists in non-Western cultures. The first intercultural study compared Dutch subjects to Turkish and Surinamese immigrants, and the findings showed that social sharing was a prominent behavior in each group, although slightly less so for the Surinamese subjects. Other studies comparing Western and Eastern cultures produced similar results, finding that Eastern cultures had slightly lower rates of social sharing. Furthermore, several general qualitative <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>between</b> Western and Eastern populations. On average, Western subjects shared an emotional event more often (5–6 times) than Asian subjects (2–3 times). There was also a longer delay between the emotional event and the social sharing for Asian groups than for Western ones.|$|E

Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 15 male athletic voluntaries to participate in this study and did two intensive aerobic and anaerobic tests in a 2 experimental trials separated by at least 10 day. Blood sample were taken before, immediately, 1 and 24 hours after tests to analysis number of circulating leukocytes, neutrophils and monocytes. Results: A significant <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>between</b> number of leucocytes before, immediately, 1 and 24 hours after aerobic test (P 0. 05). A significant <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>between</b> number of neutrophils before, immediately, 1 and 24 hours after aerobic test (P 0. 05). A significant <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>between</b> number of monocytes before, immediately, 1 and 24 hours after aerobic test (P 0. 05). A significant <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>between</b> number of leukocytes before, immediately, 1 and 24 hours after anaerobic test (P 0. 05). A significant <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>between</b> number of neutrophils before, immediately, 1 and 24 hours after anaerobic test (P 0. 05). A significant <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>between</b> number of monocytes before, immediately, 1 and 24 hours after anaerobic test (P 0. 05). These data demonstrate that intensive aerobic test was inducing increase leucocytes, neutrophils and monocytes, spatial in macrophage system. And also demonstrate that intensive anaerobic test was not inducing signification varied in immune system. Conclusion: The result is that a maximal aerobic test increase and strength the immune system and anabolic state can exercise testosterone and research has shown that this hormone can reduce immune system components...|$|R

25|$|One small 2009 {{double-blind}} study of autistic children found that 40 hourly treatments of 24% oxygen at 1.3 atmospheres provided {{significant improvement in}} the children's behavior immediately after treatment sessions but this study has not been independently confirmed. More recent, relatively large-scale controlled studies have also investigated HBOT using treatments of 24% oxygen at 1.3 atmospheres and have found less promising results. A 2010 {{double-blind study}} compared HBOT to a placebo treatment in children with autistic disorder. Both direct observational measures of behavioral symptoms and standardized psychological assessments were {{used to evaluate the}} treatment. No <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>between</b> the HBOT group and the placebo group on any of the outcome measures. A second 2011 single-subject design study also investigated the effects of 40 HBOT treatments of 24% oxygen at 1.3 atmospheres on directly observed behaviors using multiple baselines across 16 participants. Again, no consistent outcomes were observed across any group and further, no significant improvements were observed within any individual participant. Together these studies suggest that HBOT at 24% oxygen at 1.3 atmospheric pressure does not result in a clinically significant improvement of the behavioral symptoms of autistic disorder.|$|E
2500|$|Many genetic {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that most of the various Jewish ethnic divisions and Druze, Palestinians, Bedouin, Lebanese and other Levantines cluster near one another genetically. Many studies have found that Jews and Palestinians are closer to each other than the Palestinians or European Jews are to non-Jewish Europeans or Africans. They also found substantial genetic overlap between Israeli and Palestinian Arabs and Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews. A small but statistically significant difference was found in the Y-chromosomal haplogroup distributions of Sephardic Jews and Palestinians, but no significant <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>between</b> Ashkenazi Jews and Palestinians nor between the two Jewish communities, However, a highly distinct cluster was found in Palestinian haplotypes. 32% of the 143 Arab Y-chromosomes studied belonged to this [...] "I Arab clade", which contained only one non-Arab chromosome, that of a Sephardic Jew. This could possibly be attributed to the geographical isolation of the Jews or to the immigration of Arab tribes in the first millennium. The Druze people, a [...] "genetic sanctuary" [...] for the diversity of the Near East in antiquity, have been found in genetic studies to be the closest to Jews of the populations in the Levant. Lebanese also cluster closely with Jewish ethnic groups, closer than Syrians and Palestinians, according to a 2010 study by Behar et al. The single archeogenetic study of the southern Levant (Salamon et al., 2010) explored mtDNA haplogroups of Chalcolithic period from a cave in the Judean Desert.|$|E
