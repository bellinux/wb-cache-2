40|$|This paper aims at {{analysing}} {{the election}} and jurisdiction of <b>executive</b> <b>bodies</b> in local self-government units, and their relations with the representative bodies, especially in context of mutual influence on local political process. In this context, the models of election of local <b>executive</b> <b>bodies</b> have been analysed and compared with the present German local self-government system, and some other continental European countries. The research {{has been based on}} the application of the comparative method. Thus, two models of <b>executive</b> <b>bodies</b> have been established: monocratic and collegial. These models result from implementation of two research methods, i. e. analyses and synthesis.

The subjective satisfaction or mere ipse dixit of the <b>executive</b> <b>body</b> is insufficient. However, the adoption of this objective test was only part of the obiter dicta of the case.

5|$|The four judges {{then went}} on to decide that the {{jurisdiction}} involved an exercise of judicial power, mentioning an earlier decision of Justice Isaacs, in which he had taken a functional approach, and determined that some functions, when conferred upon a legislative or <b>executive</b> <b>body,</b> can involve the exercise of non-judicial power, but the same functions when conferred on a judicial body involve the exercise of judicial power. The four judges found that the powers conferred on the court, to take evidence and compel witnesses and such, when vested in a judicial body such as the court, involved the exercise of judicial power. As such, the jurisdiction did not offend the separation of powers.|$|E
5|$|Under {{administrative}} law, {{judicial review}} {{is an exercise}} in which the High Court scrutinizes the executive's decisions and orders to ensure that they conform with the law. If the decisions and orders are not authorized by statute or if they have been made in contravention of administrative law principles, the Court can invalidate them. Similarly, if any exercise of power by an <b>executive</b> <b>body</b> contravenes the Constitution, the Court has a duty to declare it invalid. With regards to the ISA and the powers to detain without trial, the scope of judicial review was subject to a succession of changes between 1988 and 1990. These changes revolved around the issue of whether the discretion of the President and the Home Affairs Minister should be assessed objectively or subjectively. During that period, the scope of judicial review was expanded by common law developments but was subsequently curtailed by legislative and constitutional amendments.|$|E
