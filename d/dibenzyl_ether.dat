40|$|A {{steady-state}} {{and laser}} flash photolysis (LFP) {{study of the}} TPPBF 4 -photosensitized oxidation of ring-methoxylated benzyl alcohols has been carried out. Direct evidence on the involvement of intermediate benzyl alcohol radical cations and benzylic cations in these reactions has been provided through LFP experiments. The reactions lead {{to the formation of}} products (benzaldehydes, <b>dibenzyl</b> <b>ethers,</b> and diphenylmethanes) whose amounts and distributions are influenced by the number and relative position of the methoxy substituents. This behavior has been rationalized in terms of the interplay between the stabilities of benzyl alcohol radical cations and benzyl cations involved in these processes. A general mechanism for the TPPBF 4 -photosensitized reactions of ring-methoxylated benzyl alcohols has been proposed, where the a-OH group of the parent substrate acts as the deprotonating base promoting Î±-C-H deprotonation of the benzyl alcohol radical cation (formed after electron transfer from the benzyl alcohol to TPP*) to give a benzyl radical and a protonated benzyl alcohol, precursor of the benzylic cation.

This situation brings the price of glycerol to drop dramatically. Solketal, a derivative from glycerol, can be utilized by blending with gasoline or biodiesel as an additive. This work studies the synthesis of solketal from glycerol and acetone using homogeneous acid catalyst. The reaction progresses successfully when using the acetone in excess.

The first generation organic benzyl alcohol and bromide wedges have been prepared, and a first generation organic dendrimer was synthesised. The preparation of novel organochromium dendrimers has been investigated. Several chromium arene complexes were prepared by different routes, and the halogenation methodology was thoroughly explored with various reagents. The target compound, a chromium complexed first generation dendritic wedge, was not accessible {{by any of the}} methods investigated. The novel compound (<b>dibenzyl</b> <b>ether)</b> bis[tricarbonylchromium(O) ] has been prepared by two routes and the crystal structure of this complex was determined. Several other chromium arene complexes were synthesised, and the crystal structure of one of these, (benzyl methyl ether) tricarbonylchromium(O), was determined. The structure and properties of the organic and organochromium dendrimers {{have been investigated}} by molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics techniques. The existing CHARMm polymer force field was extended to include parameters for the tricarbonylchromium moiety. The two crystal structures solved as part of the synthetic effort, were used in this regard. The accuracy of the new parameters was assessed by simulation of the crystal structure of (<b>dibenzyl</b> <b>ether)</b> bis[tricarbonylchromium(O) ]. The important ether linkage torsion angle parameter, which plays {{a significant role in the}} topology of the dendrimer, was singled out for refinement. The torsion angle was parameterised with the model compound benzyl phenyl ether, by fitting the CHARMm results for rotation about the dihedral, to ab initio torsional data. Molecular dynamics simulations have been performed on generations one through five of the organic and organochromium dendrimers. The radius of gyration and RMS variation were investigated as a function of generation for both dendrimer series. The radius of gyration was found to increase exponentially with generation, whereas the relationship of RMS variation to generation was not as well defined. Density distributions were calculated for all five generations of the organic and organometallic dendrimers. In addition, the distribution of the monomers from each generation within the dendrimer was analysed. In the later generation dendrimers, the monomers belonging to the earlier generations are extended, while the terminal groups are mobile and found in all regions of the dendrimer. The solvent accessible surface was calculated for the organochromium dendrimers. It was concluded from these results that although the terminal groups are mobile, the majority of these monomers remain on the periphery of the dendrimer, or in solvent accessible areas...|$|E

The Se precursor was tri-n-octylphosphine selenide (TOP-Se). Without the presence of P 3 HT, the resulting NCs consist of a p-type (Cu 1 + rich) core and an n-type (In 3 + rich) shell. Such a gradient stoichiometry was moderated to be substantially more homogeneous because the presence of P 3 HT is believed to have significantly reduced the reactivity difference between Cu(acac) 2 and In(acac) 3, as well as and their respective monomers. Furthermore, the P 3 HT also acts as a surface coordination species, contributing to the readily preparation of conducting polymer-NCs hybrids by a single-step synthesis.

Oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde in 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium triflate was studied by in-situ FTIR spectroscopy and 13 C NMR spectroscopy on carbon- 13 -labeled benzyl alcohol. Careful control of the reaction conditions is necessary because ammonium hexanitratocerate(IV) dissolved in an ionic liquid can transform benzyl alcohol not only into benzaldehyde but also into benzyl nitrate or benzoic acid.
