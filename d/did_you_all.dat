The raider grinned: [...] "Hello! How did you get here? <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> come in the same litter?" [...] A stuttering hero who had been bragging of what he would do to the enemy if he got at them, was surprised by Morgan's men with a demand for his surrender. He flung up his hands instantly.

6000|$|But when, a {{few minutes}} after, Edward came up with Alison for his farewell, they found her lying back in her chair, half fainting, and her startled look told almost too plainly {{that she had not}} thought of her brother. [...] "Never mind," [...] said Edward, affectionately, as much to console Alison as Ermine for this oblivion; [...] "of course it must be so, and I don't deserve otherwise. Nothing brought me home but Colin Keith's telling me that he saw you would not have him till my {{character}} was cleared up; and now he has repaired so much of the evil I <b>did</b> <b>you,</b> <b>all</b> I can do is to work to make it up to you in other ways. Goodbye, Ermine, I leave you all in much better hands than mine ever were, you are right enough in feeling that a week of his absence outweighs a year of mine. Bless you for all that you and he have done for my child. She, at least, is a comfort to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I ask the indulgence of {{the house}} while I explain this most painful matter. I am sorry to say what I am about to say, since it must inflict {{irreparable}} injury upon Mr. Billson, whom I have always esteemed and respected until now, and in whose invulnerability to temptation I entirely believed--as <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>all.</b> But {{for the preservation of}} my own honour I must speak--and with frankness. I confess with shame--and I now beseech your pardon for it--that I said to the ruined stranger all of the words contained in the test-remark, including the disparaging fifteen. (Sensation.) When the late publication was made I recalled them, and I resolved to claim the sack of coin, for by every right I was entitled to it. Now I will ask you to consider this point, and weigh it well; that stranger's gratitude to me that night knew no bounds; he said himself that he could find no words for it that were adequate, and that if he should ever be able he would repay me a thousandfold. Now, then, I ask you this; could I expect--could I believe--could I even remotely imagine--that, feeling as he did, he would do so ungrateful a thing as to add those quite unnecessary fifteen words to his test?--set a trap for me?--expose me as a slanderer of my own town before my own people assembled in a public hall? It was preposterous; it was impossible. His test would contain only the kindly opening clause of my remark. Of that I had no shadow of doubt. You would have thought as I did. You would not have expected a base betrayal from one whom you had befriended and against whom you had committed no offence. And so with perfect confidence, perfect trust, I wrote {{on a piece of paper}} the opening words--ending with [...] "Go, and reform,"--and signed it. When I was about to put it in an envelope I was called into my back office, and without thinking I left the paper lying open on my desk." [...] He stopped, turned his head slowly toward Billson, waited a moment, then added: [...] "I ask you to note this; when I returned, a little latter, Mr. Billson was retiring by my street door." [...] (Sensation.) ...|$|E
