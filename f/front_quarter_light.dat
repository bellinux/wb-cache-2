50|$|The 1954 Morris Cowley was a four-cylinder midsize car {{produced}} from 1954 to 1959. It {{was essentially a}} budget version of the Morris Oxford series III with less chrome, no heater, fixed <b>front</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>lights</b> and a simplified dashboard.|$|R
5000|$|The Austin 3-Litre is a British {{saloon car}} that was {{introduced}} by Austin at the London Motor Show in 1967. It became apparent that BMC were not geared up to producing the car: few or none {{seem to have been}} sold that year, but by July 1968 it was reported that the cars had begun to leave the factory. By that time the square headlights seen at the 1967 motor show had been replaced by conventional round twin headlamp units, and {{by the time of the}} October 1968 show the car had also acquired <b>front</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>lights.</b> [...] In July 1968, with cars beginning to emerge from the plant, the manufacturers were asked to detail improvements reportedly implemented since the car's [...] "launch" [...] the previous October. Mention was made of orifice modifications to hydraulic valves in the rear suspension, and it was stated that there was a [...] "new" [...] final drive ratio of 3.9:1, though this was actually the same final drive ratio included in the launch information the previous October.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the sale}} of the {{business}} to Simca, the new owners found themselves with the final handful of the Talbot Lago Americas, which were still awaiting engines. [...] There was now no question of Simca being permitted, or wishing, to produce cars with BMW engines, and the only solution available was to fit the last batch of cars with Simca's own 2351 cc V8. [...] This engine had its roots in 1930s Detroit, and was originally provided by Ford to give the (then) Ford Vedette produced by their French subsidiary a flavor of the driving experience offered by an unstressed US style V8 sedan. It was by no stretch of the imagination an engine for a sports car, and even with a second carburetor produced only , as against the [...] of the BMW-engined cars from the previous year's production. [...] Claimed top speed was now reduced to 165 km/h (103 mph) in place of the 200 km/h (124 mph) listed the previous year. [...] In addition to installing their V8 engine, Simca replaced the laterally sliding windows in the doors of the final cars which now wound down into the door in the conventional manner: the change also involved adding <b>front</b> <b>quarter</b> <b>lights</b> / <b>quarter</b> windows at the front end of each door.|$|R

25|$|Side {{corridor}} stock {{such as the}} J6 thirds and F2 composites had {{doors with}} adjacent <b>quarter</b> <b>lights</b> to all compartments and ventilation was by droplights set into the doors.

The skirt has a small dip in the <b>front</b> <b>quarter</b> with a divide secured by two small buttons {{in order to get the}} skirt around the bill. The small section in the <b>front</b> <b>quarter</b> was built shorter to show the insignia, and cover the wearer's chin or mouth, without disturbing breathing by covering the nose.|$|R
50|$|In 1991 {{the rear}} indicators, tail lights and brake lights were {{relocated}} to the bumper {{from the body}} to meet Australian Design Rules, however they stayed the same in European versions. In 1992 another set of indicators {{were placed on the}} <b>front</b> <b>quarter</b> panel.|$|R

40|$|Interdependency among udder {{quarters}} with {{subclinical mastitis}} was evaluated on 150 farms using {{a total of}} 35, 828 udder quarters. The occurrence of high somatic cell count (SCC) (> 250, 000 cells/ml) in 0, 3, and 4 quarters occurred {{at a higher rate}} than would be expected based on independence of the quarters. For all bacterial species, intramammary infection in 0, 2, 3, or 4 quarters of the same cow occurred at a higher rate than would be expected based on independence of the quarters. Intramammary infection and high SCC were found less often in <b>front</b> <b>quarters</b> than in rear quarters. High SCC and intramammary infection occurred more often in right <b>front</b> <b>quarters</b> than in left <b>front</b> <b>quarters.</b> High SCC in diagonal quarters occurred at a lower rate than expected. Corynebacterium bovis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Staphylococcus aureus had the highest intraclass correlation within herd. Streptococcus uberis had a very low intraclass correlation within herd. The intraclass correlation within cow for the natural logarithm of SCC was 0. 47. Corynebacterium bovis and Strep. agalactiae had the highest intraclass correlation within cow, and Streptococcus dysgalactiae had the lowest. Analytical methods were proposed to manage the problem of interdependence and its effect on the design or evaluation of field studies on subclinical mastitis.

50|$|Wooden staves can be {{used instead}} with a yoke, which is then termed a withers yoke, named after animals with high backs (withers) (e.g. zebu cattle) which pull mostly on the yoke part of the equipment, not as greatly on the bow shape borne by the {{stronger}} <b>front</b> <b>quarters</b> of oxen and bullocks.|$|R

40|$|Aim of this {{research}} was to study the effect of somatic cell count on mineral content and salt equilibria at the level of quarter milk samples. Ten Italian Friesian cows, in which two homologous <b>quarters</b> (<b>front</b> <b>quarters</b> in 1 cow, rear quarters in 6 cows and both rear and <b>front</b> <b>quarters</b> in 3 cows) were characterised by a milk SCC 400, 000 cells/mL (HC-milk), respectively, were selected. Cows were milked at quarter level during the morning milking and a single sample was collected from each selected quarter, thus, 26 quarter milk samples were collected. Compared to LC-milk, HC-milk was characterised by a lower content of phosphorus and potassium and by a higher content of both sodium and chloride. The equilibrium of calcium, phosphorus and magnesium between the colloidal and soluble phase of milk and the mineralisation degree of the casein micelles, were not different between HC and LC milk...|$|R
50|$|On January 30, 2014, a new Chase system {{resembling}} the playoff systems {{used in other}} major league sports was announced at Media Day.

The <b>front</b> <b>quarter</b> ducts are also revised and completed in a black finish. The rear bumper is also completely revised with a new, more pronounced diffuser and twin-circle exhaust tips.

50|$|Rapid Cabriolet (1984 - 1990) - Developed {{from the}} Rapid Coupe at Ludgate Design Developments in Kent {{initially}} in Standard form only, {{which included a}} removable full-sized hood and a central rollover T-bar.

50|$|The 3000 sports {{convertible}} Mark II {{was launched}} {{at the end}} of August 1962. It was a true convertible with almost saloon car comfort, a new wrap-around windscreen, wind-up side windows, swivelling <b>quarter</b> <b>lights</b> and a quick-action folding roof. Twin SU HS6 carburettors replaced the triple SUs. Austin-Healey claimed it could exceed 115 mph.|$|R
5000|$|Comparisons {{between the}} Victor and the broadly similar Rüsselsheim built Opel Rekord Series D were inevitable. An {{important}} {{difference from the}} back seat involved the rear doors. The Opel's door incorporated rear <b>quarter</b> <b>lights</b> and windows that wound fully down into the door whereas Vauxhall's designers preferred the [...] "cleaner uncluttered look" [...] arising from their elimination of rear <b>quarter</b> <b>lights.</b> The fact that back seat passengers could only open their windows down to approximately a third of their depth before further opening was blocked by the presence of the wheel arches was held out as a safety feature to complement the fitting of child-proof locks, given that back-seat passengers would no doubt include small children. Despite the absence of shared body panels anywhere that they could be seen, detailed investigation disclosed that minor assemblies such as the door locks and the wiper mechanisms were shared with the Opel Rekord D.|$|R
