2500|$|Series creator Alan Ball had {{previously}} {{worked with the}} cable channel HBO on Six Feet Under, which ran for five seasons. In October 2005, after Six Feet Under wrapped, Ball signed a two-year agreement with HBO to develop and produce original programming for the network. True Blood became the first project under the deal, after Ball became acquainted with Charlaine Harris' Southern Vampire Mystery books. One day, while early for a dental appointment, Ball was browsing through a Barnes & Noble bookshop and came across Dead Until Dark (2001), the first installment in Harris' series. He read the entries that followed and became interested in [...] "bringing [...] vision to television". However, Harris already had two other adaptation options for the books. She said she chose to work with him, though, because [...] " [...] really 'got' me. That's how he convinced {{me to go with}} him. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> he understood what I was doing with the books." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1965, Wilson met Tony Asher at a {{recording}} studio in Los Angeles. Asher {{was at the time}} a 26-year-old lyricist and copywriter working in jingles for an advertising agency. The two exchanged ideas for songs, and soon after, Wilson heard of Asher's writing abilities from mutual friends. In December 1965, he contacted Asher about a possible lyric collaboration, wanting to do something [...] "completely different" [...] with someone he had never written with before. Asher accepted the offer, and within ten days, they were writing together. Wilson played some of the music he had recently recorded and gave a cassette to Asher containing the backing track to a piece called [...] "In My Childhood". The result of Asher's tryout was eventually retitled [...] "You Still Believe in Me", and the success of the piece convinced Wilson that Asher was the wordsmith he had been looking for. When Wilson was asked why he felt Asher was the right collaborator: [...] "Oh, a lot of reasons. One, I thought he was a cool person. Two, anybody that hung out with [...] Loren Schwartz was a very brainy guy, a real verbal type person. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> there was something there that had to be, you know, that really had to be." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Suddenly she sat {{straight}} {{up with a}} sort of convulsive shudder, and at the same time--you may laugh if you like--the most horrible feeling came over me.

6000|$|Over {{and through}} Carol ran a frightened cautiousness. [...] "Like him? I haven't an í-dea. He {{seems to be}} a very decent young man. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> when he'd worked so hard on the plans for the match, it was a shame not to be nice to him." ...|$|E

500|$|Carter openly wept in {{the locker}} room after the game and was {{affected}} so badly by the loss that he considered retirement. [...] "Walking off that field and losing like that," [...] Carter reflected, [...] "I didn't even know if I wanted to play football anymore. Because <b>I</b> <b>just,</b> <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> like <b>that</b> I would never win after that." [...] He went on to call the game, [...] "The most devastating loss that I've ever been a part of." [...] Both Carter and fellow Hall of Fame member Randle believed that the 1998 Vikings team was their best chance at winning a Super Bowl; neither player would ever reach the Super Bowl in their careers.|$|R
5000|$|He {{also spoke}} {{about how the}} album cover was {{inspired}} by Nas in the film Belly, saying: [...] "Well, I’ve always like <b>that</b> picture. I <b>felt</b> like <b>that</b> picture describes my title: dreaming, zoning, and achieving, like, I’m doing all three in that picture. That image with Nas sitting there, {{back in the day}} just was so much for me. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> like flipping <b>that</b> into a cover would be the right thing to. Plus it was painted. Shout out to BK." ...|$|R
5000|$|According to Kim Newman in his book, Nightmare Movies, when Reeves made a {{suggestion}} on the set, Price objected {{and told the}} director: [...] "I've made 87 [...] films. What have you done?" [...] And Reeves responded: [...] "I've made three good ones." [...] "Reeves hated me," [...] Price later recalled. [...] "He didn't want me at all for the part. I didn't like him, either. It {{was one of the}} first times in my life that I've been in a picture where the director and <b>I</b> <b>just</b> clashed."Price <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> all the actors on the set had a difficult time with the director, explaining: [...] "Michael Reeves could not communicate with actors. He would stop me and say, 'Don't move your head like that.' And I would say, 'Like what? What do you mean?' He'd say, 'There — you're doing it again. Don't do that'." [...] Price reportedly became so upset with Reeves that he refused to watch the film's dailies.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{you have}} such {{strength}} of mind, Marilla. I haven't. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> I couldn't bear Josie Pye's scorn. She would have crowed over me all my life. And I think I have been punished {{so much that you}} needn't be very cross with me, Marilla. It's not a bit nice to faint, after all. And the doctor hurt me dreadfully when he was setting my ankle. I won't be able to go around for six or seven weeks and I'll miss the new lady teacher. She won't be new any more by the time I'm able to go to school. And Gil--everybody will get ahead of me in class. Oh, I am an afflicted mortal. But I'll try to bear it all bravely if only you won't be cross with me, Marilla." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That, and a deal more. I tell you, Watson, I've {{only known}} her these few weeks, {{but from the}} first <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> she was made for me, and she, too--she was happy when she was with me, and that I'll swear. There's a light in a woman's eyes that speaks louder than words. But he has never let us get together, {{and it was only}} to-day {{for the first time that}} I saw a chance of having a few words with her alone. She was glad to meet me, but when she did it was not love that she would talk about, and she wouldn't have let me talk about it either if she could have stopped it. She kept coming back to it that this was a place of danger, and that she would never be happy until I had left it. I told her that since I had seen her I was in no hurry to leave it, and that if she really wanted me to go, the only way to work it was for her to arrange to go with me. With that I offered in as many words to marry her, but before she could answer, down came this brother of hers, running at us with a face on him like a madman. He was just white with rage, and those light eyes of his were blazing with fury. What was I doing with the lady? How dared I offer her attentions which were distasteful to her? Did I think that because I was a baronet I could do what I liked? If he had not been her brother I should have known better how to answer him. As it was I told him that my {{feelings}} towards his sister were such as I was not ashamed of, and that I hoped that she might honour me by becoming my wife. That seemed to make the matter no better, so then I lost my temper too, and I answered him rather more hotly than I should perhaps, considering that she was standing by. So it ended by his going off with her, as you saw, and here am I as badly puzzled a man as any in this county. Just tell me what it all means, Watson, and I'll owe you more than ever I can hope to pay." ...|$|E

60|$|I did so {{somewhat}} regretfully, for <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>just</b> then <b>that</b> if {{this was}} the way they welcomed the emigrant in that country it would be a relief to do battle with the whole of them. Afterward I learned that when one understands his ways, which is difficult to do at first, there are many good qualities in the Western railroad-man. Still, I always wondered why the friendless newcomer should be considered a fair mark for petty hostility, especially by those who formerly were poor themselves--all of which applies only to city-bred men who hold some small office, for those who live by hard labor in forest and prairie would share their last crust with the stranger.|$|R
50|$|We {{were trying}} to figure out what we wanted to do, and my brother had been working out some stuff, when I saw that Bruegel {{painting}} in a book my girlfriend had. I liked that it had a really intriguing meaning, like there's a story to each little scene. Which <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> fitting for <b>that</b> record- dense but unified, not a collage or anything. And I liked its Where's Waldo? quality, that it was something you could look at for a long time on a vinyl sleeve and find new little things.It was very easy to get the museum in Berlin that has it to say yes. They were super excited a band wanted to use it and put it in their newsletter. When you open it up on the inside there's a paisley pattern traced from the back of a book that Skye (Skjelset, lead guitar)'s mum got me. We wanted two very different feelings.|$|R

Yeah it was hard to leave, but it’s a {{business}} move. Ya know? If someone’s gonna be your friend, it shouldn’t depend on what company you ride for. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> had to make a power move to benefit myself. I’m really stoked on the choice I made.

5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> {{the full}} screen greatly {{increased}} the game quality.

5000|$|When the Yardbirds {{were looking}} for a song to follow up to their first single, [...] "I Wish You Would", they chose the Don and Bob tune. [...] The group's guitarist Eric Clapton {{explained}} in an early interview: Yardbirds were working about every single night of the week. Trouble was finding new material for a disc. We remembered this 'Good Morning Little School Girl' from a rather obscure R and B artiste—a friend of ours had it on a long-player. So we rushed in and recorded it. The single was released on October 20, 1964, in the UK, where it reached number 49 in the singles chart. Epic Records, the Yardbirds' American label, did not issue the single in the US, but in 1965 included the song on their first American album, For Your Love. Later, in his autobiography, Clapton described the early recordings: They sounded pretty lame. We just sounded young and white, and even though our second single, a cover of a rock version of 'Good Morning Little Schoolgirl', sounded much better, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>just</b> <b>that</b> we were falling short of the mark in some way. This was not something <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>just</b> about the Yardbirds, but about other bands that I admired, like Manfred Mann, the Moody Blues, and the Animals, all of whom were far better live than they were on recordings. The group recorded a live version at the Marquee Club in London, which was released on the British debut album, Five Live Yardbirds, in December 1964. On the live version, Clapton and bassist Paul Samwell-Smith provided the vocals instead of lead singer Keith Relf. The Yardbirds single version was credited to [...] "Demarais" [...] or [...] "H.G. Demarais" [...] (Dee Marais, a Shreveport, Louisiana, record label owner/distributor and business associate of Leonard Chess), although some later reissues list Sonny Boy Williamson as the songwriter. Album credits for live version are either listed as Demarais or [...] "Level-Love".|$|R

5000|$|Pat Buchanan {{decided to}} leave the Republican Party because: [...] "The Republican Party at the {{national}} level has ceased to be my party. This divorce began around the end of the Cold War when President (George) Bush declared it to be a New World-order party and began intervening all over the world. While he and I were allies and friends during the Cold War, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> once the Cold War was over the United States should return to a more traditional non-intervention foreign policy." ...|$|E
5000|$|Ashe {{began working}} as a {{stripper}} in Seattle. Never finishing high school, she started stripping {{at the age of}} seventeen using a fake ID. [...] In an interview, Ashe once explained her career choice: [...] "I guess I'm an exhibitionist. But that's not quite true. Part of the reason is that I developed huge breasts at an early age and breasts are a very sexualized thing. At an early age I was getting a lot of sexualized attention. Eventually, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> stripping kind of put all that stuff out on the table." ...|$|E

We have been working day and night with the sounds, to be correct and find the right synths etc. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> I'm in a great songwriting mood, so I had to release two parts because of all these songs.” To do this step, he was inspired by Robyn who released her album Body Talk in three parts.|$|E
