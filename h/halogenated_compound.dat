40|$|A high {{interest}} in predicting physical, chemical, and biological properties of <b>halogenated</b> <b>compounds</b> {{is generated by}} the urgent need to develop alternatives to chlorofluorocarbons, new compounds with low ozone depletion potential and a low global warming potential. Quantitative structure-retention relationships (QSRR) for <b>halogenated</b> <b>compounds</b> {{can be used to}} predict gas chromatographic retention indices by using theoretical descriptors computed from the chemical structure. QSRR models for the gas chromatographic retention indices of 207 <b>halogenated</b> <b>compounds</b> are established with the CODESSA (Comprehensive Descriptors for Structural and Statistical Analysis) program. The best results are obtained with a group of QSRR models with six structural descriptors, with a correlation coefficient between 0. 994 and 0. 993 and a leave-one-out cross-validation correlation coefficient between 0. 992 and 0. 991. All QSRR models contain the Kier and Hall connectivity index 1 χ v, the number of F atoms NoF, and the gravitation index for all pairs of atoms G 1. A fourth descriptor comes from the class of charged-partial surface area indices, while the remaining two descriptors are related to the number of I or Br atoms, bond order, or Randic connectivity index 1 χ. QSRR models developed with CODESSA allow accurate computation of the gas chromatographic retention indexes of <b>halogenated</b> <b>compounds</b> using simple constitutional, topological, geometric, electrostatic and quantum descriptors that can be computed with standard quantum chemistry packages...|$|R

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{halogenated}} organics derived from the chlorination of Humic acid {{in the presence of}} bromide was undertaken.

Amherst drinking water was also analyzed. ^ Parameters of pH, Cl/Br ratio, and time were investigated in humic acid chlorination (with bromide) to determine effects upon Trihalomethane (THM) formation. The effect of chloramination upon THM study vs. chlorination was also examined. ^ GC-MS was used to identify compounds formed from Humic acid and in tap water. Selected spectra and interpretations are included.

In a new approach, we examined the shape evolution of CdSe nanorods to hexagonal pyramids in a hot-injection synthesis under the influence of halogenated additives in the form of organic chlorine, bromine and iodine compounds. Supported by DFT calculations, this shape evolution is explained as a result of X-type ligand coordination to sloped and flat Cd-rich facets and an equilibrium shape strongly influenced by halides. Synchrotron XPS measurements and TXRF results show that the shape evolution is accompanied by a modification in the chemical composition of the ligand sphere. Our experimental results suggest that the molecular structure of the <b>halogenated</b> <b>compound</b> is related to the degree of the effect on both rod growth and further shape evolution.

For both molecules, analysis of the calculated Franck-Condon factors confirm without ambiguity that, contrary to initial claims, the C-H stretching modes are not modified in the core states and are not excited. For C(12) H(6) O(2), the vibrational fine structure appears to be mainly due to three modes, involving C=O∗ asymmetric stretch and in-plane ring deformation modes, due to the symmetry breaking of the core state. For C(12) H(2) Br(2) Cl(2) O(2), the vibrational excitation arises essentially from the C=O∗ asymmetric stretch, with numerous secondary peaks arising from hot and combination bands.
