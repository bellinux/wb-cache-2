50|$|Moreover, the Hida records {{numerous}} {{instances of}} miraculous survival and dangerous threats of his day, among them, close scrapes with the Russian Navy during {{its support of}} the Ali Bey uprising against the Turks, the <b>danger</b> of <b>boarding</b> and worse by the Knights of Malta, the possible anger of English government officials towards anyone entering the country from France or Spain, {{as well as those}} aforementioned countries' wrath against someone crossing back over from their hated enemy, England, and the daily danger of running into various anti-semitic locals and nobles throughout mainland Europe (especially Germany).|$|R
5000|$|... {{little doubt}} exists that the feature named Point Danger by Captain Cook was in actual fact the feature {{now known as}} Fingal Head. However, as the name has been known in its present {{position}} for over 130 years and having in mind {{the wording of the}} letters Patent of 6 June 1859, in which the position of the QLD-New South Wales border is linked with the position of Point <b>Danger,</b> the <b>Board</b> is not prepared to assign the name to any feature or position other than that to which it is currently located.|$|R
50|$|Captain Otter {{hailed the}} frigates, who {{answered}} by firing a single shot. The ships began trading broadsides, Pénélope gaining an initial advantage by raking her opponent with a triple-shot broadside. After one hour, Proserpine had her rigging and hull seriously damaged, {{and was in}} <b>danger</b> of being <b>boarded.</b> Her Mizzen-mast was cut three metres above the deck, and she had also lost her main top spar.|$|R
5|$|Orca, {{voiced by}} Gideon Emery, is a {{mercenary}} {{employed by the}} private military company Shoreline. During Uncharted 4: A Thief's End he is a lieutenant {{under the command of}} Nadine Ross. After their client Rafe Adler finds Captain Avery's treasure on-board his booby-trapped pirate ship, Orca draws his gun on Ross after she protests Adler on risking further <b>danger</b> in <b>boarding</b> the ship, betraying her command by siding with treasure hunter in seizing the lucrative treasure. Orca later appears in Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, taking command of Shoreline after Ross departs from the company, and has struck a deal with an Indian insurgency force headed by Asav. He purchases the Tusk of Ganesh from Asav in exchanging him a bomb that the insurgent leader plans to detonate in a nearby city to ignite a revolution. Orca later gets attacked by Ross and her associate Chloe Frazer inside his helicopter before it crashes to the ground, severely injuring him. After implying that he sold a bomb to Asav and giving up the Tusk, he quickly tries to shoot Ross but gets killed in return fire after she is saved by Sam Drake.|$|R
2500|$|Petrosian's {{style of}} play, {{although}} highly successful for avoiding defeats, was criticized as being dull. Chess enthusiasts saw his [...] "ultraconservative" [...] style as an unwelcome {{contrast to the}} popular image of Soviet chess as [...] "daring" [...] and [...] "indomitable". His 1971 Candidates Tournament match with Viktor Korchnoi featured so many monotonous draws that the Russian press began to complain. However, Svetozar Gligorić described Petrosian as being [...] "very impressive in his incomparable ability to foresee <b>danger</b> on the <b>board</b> and to avoid any risk of defeat." [...] Petrosian responded to his criticisms by saying [...] "They say my games should be more 'interesting'. I could be more 'interesting'—and also lose." [...] Petrosian was, {{in the words of}} future World Champion Vladimir Kramnik, [...] "the first defender with a capital D".|$|R
5000|$|For {{many of the}} OTC children, {{the period}} before they reached America was very difficult. Before World War II, most were simply {{assembled}} by rescue agencies directly from their home towns in Germany and Austria, and then easily escorted to America. But after the war started, {{nearly all of them}} went through extreme hardships and <b>dangers</b> when they <b>boarded</b> ship for the United States. Some did travel to the port with parents, but many traveled alone, at least for part of their flight. Some were smuggled over the Pyrenees (usually with their parents). Some were incarcerated for a time in concentration camps such as Gurs internment camp in southern France, while some spent time in a French [...] "château" [...] (large mansion) run by the Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants or OSE. It was usually only late in a journey that a Rescue Agency would start escorting the children.|$|R
60|$|Nero and Anicetus {{determined}} {{finally to}} put their plan into execution by inducing Agrippina to embark on board their barge in returning to Antium, when the time should arrive, instead of going back in her own vessel. Their other attempts to induce her to go out upon the water had failed, {{and this was the}} only opportunity that now remained. It was desirable that this embarkation should take place in the night, as the deed which they were contemplating could be more effectually accomplished under the cover of the darkness. Accordingly, on the afternoon of the day on which Agrippina was to return, Nero prepared a banquet for her, and he protracted the festivities and entertainments which attended it until late in the evening, so that it was wholly dark before his mother could take her leave. Anicetus then contrived to have one of the vessels of his fleet run against the galley in which Agrippina had come from Antium, as it lay at anchor near the shore at the place where she had landed. The galley was broken down and disabled by the collision. Anicetus came to Agrippina to report the accident, with a countenance expressive of much concern; but added that the barge which the emperor had prepared for her was at her service, and proposed to substitute that in the place of the one which had been injured. There seemed to be no other alternative, and Agrippina, after taking a very affectionate leave of her son, went gayly, and wholly unconscious of <b>danger,</b> on <b>board</b> the beautiful but treacherous vessel.|$|R
40|$|The {{takeover}} of the Turkish ship MV Mavi Marmara, which prompted massive condemnation of Israel, demonstrated clearly the widening gap between how the IDF operates and how its actions are viewed by international public opinion. The IDF appears to have operated in accordance with international law {{in the face of}} explicit provocation intended to help a known terrorist organization under the guise of providing it with humanitarian assistance. The justiﬁcation for the action was obvious, as was {{the manner in which the}} IDF acted, both in terms of the mode of action and in terms of the operational level, including the conduct of the ﬁghters whose lives were in <b>danger</b> once they <b>boarded</b> the ship. Therefore, the world’s harsh condemnation of Israel was nothing short of hypocrisy. This essay analyzes the main changes that have occurred in the strategic arena, especially the rising inﬂuence of the delegitimization campaign on the deployment of military force. The essay claims that in light of these changes the IDF must formulate a comprehensive strategy to coordinate force buildup and force deployment, and thereby allow an effective confrontation with the complex challenges facing the nation...|$|R
