40|$|Its actors {{considered}} {{the first half}} of the 15 th century as a period of the Church crisis. It is also period of several Church councils organized in order to resolve various problems of papacy., Czech Hussite heresy, the union of both Churches etc. Czech camaldolian hermit and participant of Siena council John Jerome of Prague (c. 1370 - 1440) started the way out from crisis within his own monastic order. His reform was focused on mystical experience of the popular and saint women Angela of Foligno and Catharine of Siena. In his camaldolian hermitage he prepared several sermons dealing with <b>examples</b> <b>pf</b> both women. Their experiences were used as the possible way of reform proposed by John Jerome to camaldolian community. The general reform has failed, let us reform individually, he preached and prepared the practical guide of monk to perfection. John Jerome used his experiences from the daily life of the community and also the "secret life" of its members - he surely knew as the official visitator of the order...|$|R
40|$|A {{preference}} function (PF) takes a set {{of votes}} (linear orders over {{a set of}} alternatives) as input, and produces one or more rankings (also linear orders over the alternatives) as output. Such functions have many applications, for example, aggregating the preferences of multiple agents, or merging rankings (of, say, webpages) into a single ranking. The key issue is choosing a PF to use. One natural and previously studied approach is to assume {{that there is an}} unobserved “correct ” ranking, and the votes are noisy estimates of this. Then, we can use the PF that always chooses the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the correct ranking. In this paper, we define simple ranking scoring functions (SRSFs) and show that the class of neutral SRSFs is exactly the class of neutral PFs that are MLEs for some noise model. We also define extended ranking scoring functions (ERSFs) and show a condition under which these coincide with SRSFs. We study key properties such as consistency and continuity, and consider some <b>example</b> <b>PFs.</b> In particular, we study Single Transferable Vote (STV), a commonly used PF, showing that it is an ERSF but not an SRSF, thereby clarifying {{the extent to which it}} is an MLE function. This also gives a new perspective on how ties should be broken under STV. We leave some open questions. ...|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that the central apparatus plays a significant role in regulating flagellar motility, yet little is known about how the central pair of microtubules or their associated projections assemble. Several Chlamydomonas mutants are defective in central apparatus assembly. For <b>example,</b> mutant <b>pf</b> 15 cells have paralyzed flagella that completely lack the central pair of microtubules. We have cloned the wild-type PF 15 gene and confirmed its identity by rescuing the motility and ultrastructural defects in two pf 15 alleles, the original pf 15 a mutant and a mutant generated by insertional mutagenesis. Database searches using the 798 -amino-acid polypeptide predicted from the complete coding sequence indicate that the PF 15 gene encodes the Chlamydomonas homologue of the katanin p 80 subunit. Katanin was originally identified as a heterodimeric protein with a microtubule-severing activity. These results reveal a novel role for the katanin p 80 subunit in the assembly and/or stability of the central pair of flagellar microtubules...|$|R

40|$|The African trypanosome, Trypanosoma brucei, can gauge its {{environment}} by sensing nutrient availability. For <b>example,</b> procyclic form (<b>PF)</b> trypanosomes monitor changes in glucose levels to regulate surface molecule expression, {{which is important}} for survival in the tsetse fly vector. The molecular connection between glycolysis and surface molecule expression is unknown. Here we partially characterize T. brucei homologs of the beta and gamma subunits of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and determine their roles in regulating surface molecule expression. Using flow cytometry and mass spectrometry, we found that TbAMPKbeta or TbAMPKgamma-deficient parasites express both of the major surface molecules, EP- and GPEET-procyclin, with the latter being a form that is expressed when glucose is low {{such as in the}} tsetse fly. Last, we have found that the putative scaffold component of the complex, TbAMPKbeta, fractionates with organellar components and colocalizes in part with a glycosomal marker as well as the flagellum of PF parasites...|$|R
40|$|The phenol-formaldehyde (<b>PF)</b> resin <b>manufacturing</b> {{industry}} {{is facing a}} growing challenge with respect to concerns over human health, due {{to the use of}} carcinogenic formaldehyde and sustainability due to the use of petroleum-based phenol in PF resin manufacture. Glucose and its derivative, 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural (5 -HMF), have proven to be potential substitutes for formaldehyde in the synthesis of phenolic novolac resins. This thesis investigated a number of glucose and 5 -HMF resin systems including the curing of phenol-glucose novolac resin (PG) with a bis-phenol-A type epoxy. The curing process was modeled according to the Sestak-Berggren equation (S, B) using Málek methods. This was followed by a novel one-pot two-step approach for the synthesis of phenol- 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural (PHMF) resin by reacting phenol with HMF generated in-situ from glucose. The catalytic effect of CrCl 2 /CrCl 3 and tetraethylammonium chloride (TEAC) in the process was studied and found to facilitate both glucose dehydration and phenol-aldehyde polycondensation reactions. The resulting PHMF resins had a weight average molecular weight (Mw) in the range of 700 - 900 g/mol and a structure similar to novolac PF resins. Moreover, an attempt was made to make the system greener by using lignin as a bio-based curing agent for the synthesized PHMF resin. The curing mechanism was elucidated using spectral methods and a lignin model compound. A void-free polymer matrix was produced from the PHMF resin and bis-phenol-A epoxy resin upon curing. In addition, bio-phenolic compounds were produced from woody biomass by hydrothermal liquefaction or hydrolytic depolymerisation of lignin. These bio-phenolic feedstocks were used to partially replace the petroleum-based phenol in the production of bio-based PHMF (BPHMF) resins. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to study the curing kinetics of all the cross-linking reactions for the PHMF and BPHMF resins. The kinetic parameters obtained using model-free methods and model-predicted reaction rates are in good agreement with the experimental results. The effects of different process parameters including curing temperature and reaction time were discussed, and the amount of hardener (i. e., curing agent) was optimized. Glass fiber reinforced composites of PHMF and BPHMF resins were prepared by impregnating glass fibers with the PHMF or BPHMF resins. The thermal, mechanical, dynamic mechanical and rheological properties as well as chemical and water resistance of the matrix and the composites were studied...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. This review {{provides}} an overview of the literature on the conceptualisation of the Personal Factors (PF) component of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). Method. A systematic literature review was carried out. Electronic searches were performed in Pubmed, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and SSCI. Qualitative content analysis of statements about PF was conducted using inductive coding. Results. The searches yielded 353 citations, 79 papers were eligible for analyses. Five hundred thirty-eight statements about PF were extracted, condensed and coded. Beside conceptual statements, 238 <b>examples</b> of potential <b>PF</b> as well as five attempts at classifying PF were found in the literature. PF were considered in relation to clinical service provision, assessment and intervention, in research and social security contexts. PF were seen to be related to various aspects of health, functioning, disability and the environment. Conclusions. The analysis of the literature shows that PF is seen as relevant to the application of the ICF in various settings. The review revealed a need for standardisation of PF. The literature points to the potential of PF in enhancing the understanding of functioning, disability and health, in facilitating interventions and services for people with disabilities, and strengthening the perspective of individuals in the ICF...|$|R
40|$|We {{present some}} recent {{experimental}} and theoritical results obtained on the single particle and spin-density wave (SDW) conductivity in the Bechgaard salts (TMTSF) 2 NO 3 and (TMTSF) 2 PF 6. Particular emphasis {{is paid to}} the clearest <b>example</b> (TMTSF) 2 <b>PF</b> 6 {{for which there is}} experimental evidence, namely the absence od 2 kF diffuse scattering at low temperatures, for a pure SDW state below 12  K. A theoritical analysis starting from the anisotropic Hubbard model and taking into account the influence of long range Coulomb interactions can account for many features of the experimental data. The magnitude and temperature dependence of the threshold field and to some extent the magnitude of the SDW conductivity are well accounted for by this theory. Comparison with experimental data shows that for most batches of samples the SDW is weakly pinned to randomly distributed impurities or defects. Defects were then introduced in a controlled way by X-ray irradiation. This caused a substantial increase in threshold field and a changeover to the behaviour expected for a strongly pinned SDW. For a particular batch of samples the temperature dependence of the threshold field was unusual. A detailed theoretical analysis of commensurability pinning leads us to conclude that in this case the SDW was commensurate with the lattice. Some recent data dor the SDW conductivity in the field induced SDW phases of (TMTSF) 2 PF 6 under pressure are also reported and discussed within the same theoretical framework...|$|R
40|$|The {{pressure}} plate method {{is a standard}} method for measuring the pF curves, also called soil water retention curves, in a large soil moisture range from saturation to a dry state corresponding to a tension pressure of near 1500 kPa. However, the {{pressure plate}} can only provide discrete water retention curves represented by a dozen measured points. In contrast, the measurement of the soil water retention curves by tensiometer is direct and continuous, but limited to {{the range of the}} tensiometer reading: from saturation to near 70 - 80 kPa. The two methods stem from two very different concepts of measurement and the compatibility of both methods has never been demonstrated. The recently established thermodynamic formulation of the pedostructure water retention curve, will allow the compatibility of the two curves to be studied, both theoretically and experimentally. This constitutes the object of the present article. We found that the pressure plate method provides accurate measurement points of the pedostructure water retention curve h(W), conceptually the same as that accurately measured by the tensiometer. However, contrarily to what is usually thought, h is not equal to the applied air pressure on the sample, but rather, is proportional to its logarithm, in agreement with the thermodynamic theory developed in the article. The pF curve and soil water retention curve, as well as their methods of measurement are unified in a same physical theory. It is the theory of the soil medium organization (pedostructure) and its interaction with water. We show also how the hydrostructural parameters of the theoretical curve equation can be estimated from any measured curve, whatever the method of measurement. An application <b>example</b> using published <b>pF</b> curves is given...|$|R
40|$|Since their discovery, {{semiconducting}} conjugated polymers {{have shown}} great promise as active materials {{for a range}} of electronic devices. Initially desired for their high quantum yield, conjugated polymers have become popular due to their low cost and potential to be transferred to existing technology. Conjugated polymers are liquid crystalline, packing into well ordered domains upon thermal annealing of the films, which often leads to complex polymer interactions that can affect their semiconducting properties such as charge transport, emission color and ultimately device efficiency. Film morphology is difficult to characterize, with the order often varying on the nanoscale within a film. Near field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) combined with Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) can probe the degree of order of a film on the nanoscale and correlate it to topography; this can then be related to changes in luminescence emission and device characteristics to infer how charges are moving within a film. The effect of morphology on device function can vary between polymer systems; for <b>example,</b> di-alkyl polyfluorenes (<b>PFs),</b> a popular blue emitter for LEDs, undergo fluorescence degradation from ketone-based defects. Ordering of PF films containing some chemical defects increased the energy transfer from pristine chains to defects, increasing the defects’ degrading effect on the film emission. In comparison, the air-stable di-alkyl polyphenylene ethynylenes (PPEs) have numerous chain interactions in the amorphous pristine film, but show evidence of fewer interactions between these chains after ordering the film rather than more interactions. PPE polymers with varied lengths of sidechains produce dissimilar electroluminescence intensities, due to differences in their morphologies that affected how charges moved and recombined within the films. Understanding the effect of changes in polymer film morphology on luminescence and charge movement will help future efforts in understanding more complex polymer interactions, such as seen in blended polymer films...|$|R
