5000|$|Throughout {{his years}} of research, {{he arrived at the}} {{conclusion}} that the more attention society provides to gangs, the more active and upward rising gang activity becomes. His evaluation on The Group <b>Guidance</b> <b>Project</b> can illustrate his point. The Group <b>Guidance</b> <b>Project</b> was a program that began back in the 1940s by the Los Angeles Probation Department with a goal of reuniting gang members to their community through different group activities such as weekly club meetings, sports activities, tutoring, individual counseling, and advocacy with community agencies and organizations. However, Klein claims that [...] "increased group programming leads to increased cohesiveness (in both gang growth and gang ‘tightness'), and increased cohesiveness leads to increased gang crime." [...] Klein believes that cohesion is one (if not the biggest) part of a street gang and with programs like these, it only serves to increase cohesion between gangs by giving them a more organized methods towards their activities.|$|E

The use of ICT in this project had the aim of favouring interactions between students and professionals, as well as allowing students to enhance their knowledge of the professional world of music. Project aims are explained, together with the reasons that justify the choice of a blended learning modality involving face-to-face coaching sessions and a purpose-built online course and radio programmes. Examples of activities are given which show the diversity of interaction modalities that ICT make possible, including interaction between professionals and students via discussion forums, e- mail, chat, and videoconferencing. Apart from the positive outcomes, the challenges that can be faced in a blended learning process are also mentioned...|$|E
