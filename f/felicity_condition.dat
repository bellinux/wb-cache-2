30|$|I {{propose that}} the first meaning {{component}} in 57 a {{is responsible for the}} licensing of epistemic modals in the complement clauses of counterfactual attitudes, and the <b>felicity</b> <b>condition</b> in 57 b is responsible for the disallowance of epistemic possibility modals. This counterfactual <b>felicity</b> <b>condition</b> is also the cause for the lack of parenthetical uses and the unnegatability of counterfactual attitudes.|$|E
30|$|My {{analysis}} goes as follows. The doxastic {{component in}} the semantics of counterfactual attitudes provides an information state that epistemic modals can be anaphoric to, thereby licensing epistemic modals; however, their counterfactual component filters out epistemic possibility modals since the resulting existential quantification over the information state via semantic composition of the modals and the embedding attitude implies that the domain of quantification is not totally excluded from the set of common ground worlds. This leads to violation of the <b>felicity</b> <b>condition.</b> Therefore, epistemic possibility modals cannot be licensed in this attitudinal context.|$|E
30|$|This {{paper is}} {{structured}} as follows. In Section  2, I give a {{brief review of}} the literature on attitudes and epistemics, with a special emphasis on Anand and Hacquard’s (2013) study. Section  3 presents the syntactic and semantic properties of counterfactual attitudes in TSM and the distribution of epistemic modals in this attitudinal context. In Section  4, I present the semantics of counterfactual attitudes, based on which the distributional fact is accounted for. In addition, I adopt the analysis advocated by Veltman (1996), Hacquard (2006, 2010), and Yalcin (2007) that embedded epistemic modals obtain their modal bases via anaphoric reference. My analysis is sketched in the following lines: counterfactual attitudes provide an information state that epistemic modals can be anaphoric to, thereby licensing epistemic modals; however, the counterfactual component in the semantics of such attitudes, as a <b>felicity</b> <b>condition,</b> filters out epistemic possibility modals, since the resulting existential quantification over the information state via semantic composition of the modals and the embedding attitude implies that the domain of quantification is not totally excluded from the set of “common ground” worlds that contain all background information established in the actual world (see Stalnaker 1970, 2002 for the notion of common ground). This leads to violation of the <b>felicity</b> <b>condition.</b> Therefore, epistemic possibility modals cannot be licensed in this attitudinal context. I conclude this paper in Section  5.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 This thesis {{provides}} <b>felicity</b> <b>conditions</b> for counterfactual conditionals containing proper {{names in}} which essential changes {{to an individual}} are counterfactually posited using contrastive focus in either the antecedent or consequent clause. The <b>felicity</b> <b>conditions</b> proposed are an adaptation of Heim's (1992) CCP Semantics into Kratzer's (1981) truth conditions for counterfactual conditionals in which the partition function f(w) serves as the local context of evaluation for the antecedent clause, while the set of worlds characterized by the antecedent serves as the local context for the consequent clause. In order for the <b>felicity</b> <b>conditions</b> to generate the right results, it is shown {{that they must be}} couched in a rigid designator/essentialist framework inspired by Kripke (1980). This correctly predicts that consequents containing rigid designators are infelicitous when their input context [...] the set of worlds accessible from the antecedent clause [...] does not contain a suitable referent...|$|R
40|$|Language is a {{media to}} {{communicate}} with each other. In communication, there are many meanings being interpreted. Those interpretations can be investigated by Speech Acts theory. Because of various different interpretations, the writer investigates the aspects of illocutionary act. Consequently, {{in order to understand the}} illocutionary act, the writer investigates <b>felicity</b> <b>conditions</b> based on the context. As a media, he uses the film The Chronicles of Narnia : The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe because in this film, Aslan as the main protagonist produces utterances which contain different illocutionary acts to different people with different purpose which can be analyzed based on the <b>felicity</b> <b>conditions</b> and figure of speech. As theories, he uses the concept of symbol and allusion, Searle?s and Austin?s speech acts theory, and Hurford and Heasley?s <b>felicity</b> <b>conditions.</b> In analyzing the film, he uses Internet website to search the script. The data are divided into five scenes that describe the scene based on context. He identifies Aslan?s illocutionary act utterances then put the results into a table in the Appendix. As a result, in this film, Aslan uses different illocutionary act to different people (the Witch and the children/Narnians with different purposes, even though he uses same illocutionary act (like ordering). Finally, the <b>felicity</b> <b>conditions</b> and context signify illocutionary act importantly to avoid miscommunication...|$|R
40|$|In {{the logical}} {{tradition}} of analytical philosophy, {{to understand the}} meaning of an utterance is to understand its truth conditions. In the tradition of natural language analysis, meaning is related to the use of language. Since Grice, meaning is linked to speakers’ attitudes and actions. Following Austin, Searle and Vanderveken, to mean is to use words with the intention of performing illocutionary acts. Such acts have <b>felicity</b> <b>conditions</b> instead of truth conditions. The aim {{of this paper is to}} clarify the nature of meaning in the second trend of the contemporary philosophy of language. In my view, to mean something is mainly to attempt to perform illocutionary acts. Every attempt is an intentional action rather than an attitude. I will characterize the nature of the act of meaning and analyse its <b>felicity</b> <b>conditions...</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{other half}} of the {{semantics}} of these attitudes is taken care of by the interaction of the two inferences. The first inference states that the set of worlds that forms the quantificational domain, i.e., D(w), which the attitude works on, is a set of p-worlds, and the second inference tells us that the set of common ground worlds, i.e., C, which contains all the background assumptions (by the speaker), is a set of ¬p-worlds. Since D(w) is totally excluded from C, which is taken as the world of evaluation (by the speaker), viz. the actual world, this gives rise to counterfactuality. The interaction of these two inferences leads to my proposal of a counterfactual <b>felicity</b> <b>condition,</b> which is the other meaning component involved in the semantics of the attitudes in question. This proposal is inspired by von Fintel’s (a) discussion on the presupposition of subjunctive conditionals. One may question the validity of incorporating a <b>felicity</b> <b>condition,</b> which is pragmatic in nature, into semantics. It should be noted, however, that it is not unusual to integrate the pragmatic aspects of presupposition into semantics. That is what various proposals within the framework of dynamic semantics attempted to do; see Heim (1982, 1992) for instance. My proposal in this paper is another attempt to deal with presupposition (more specifically, counterfactual presupposition) in semantics.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to reveal the {{inferential}} structure, the functions and the <b>felicity</b> <b>conditions</b> of indirect reports from a novel perspective by {{the application of a}} model of plausible argumentation (Kertész and Rákosi 2012).

As regards the inferential structure of indirect reports, the p-model interprets the relation between the original utterance and the processed report in terms of two consecutive plausible inferences. Then, indirect reports are assumed to function as effective tools of problem solving in cases in which the original speaker’s authority is greater than that of the reporter, or if the reporter does not want {{to take responsibility for the}} truth of the original utterance.

40|$|Speech acts play an {{important}} role in human?s interaction because when we say something, we do not deliver only meaning of the utterance but also the intended meaning behind it. We can find speech acts in daily conversation even in a film. The writer is interested in analyzing speech act on film "Ada Apa Dengan Cinta" (A 2 DC) because it presents complete form of speech acts. In A 2 DC, the actors use utterances to express their idea or their feeling. Thus, the understanding of types of utterance of performative utterances and their <b>felicity</b> <b>conditions</b> are very useful to avoid misinterpretation of the speaker?s meaning. In this study, the writer wants to find out the types of utterance of performative utterances and their <b>felicity</b> <b>conditions</b> which are used by the main characters in A 2 DC and their relationship. The writer uses Langacker and Searle theory in analyzing her data. She also uses Levinson and David W. Carroll context of speech acts to complete her theory. In analyzing her data, the writer uses descriptive approach to describe the types of utterance which occur in A 2 DC. The writer puts the result of the analysis in the table in order to make the writer easier in counting utterances. After doing her analysis, the writer finds that the main characters use all of five types of utterance of performative utterances. Besides, the writer finds that all the data has the <b>conditions</b> as <b>felicity</b> <b>conditions,</b> so none of them can be called as infelicitous...|$|R

This latter component is also responsible for the epistemic licensing behavior of counterfactual attitude verbs, that is, such attitude verbs allowing epistemic necessity but not possibility modals in their complement clauses.

40|$|Introduction In {{their paper}} in Linguistics & Philosophy on the {{semantics}} and pragmatics of topic phrases, Portner and Yabushita (1998) propose {{a theory of}} Extended File Change Semantics that is able to account {{for a range of}} topicalization phenomena in Japanese and English. One particular phenomenon [...] -the one that Portner and Yabushita dwell on the longest [...] -is their observation that, in Japanese, "a discourse entity can be most readily picked out with information that has been attributed to it while it is the topic. " They formalize this observation into a <b>felicity</b> <b>condition,</b> the Strong Familiarity Condition, on Japanese definite NPs. According to Portner and Yabushita (henceforth, P&Y), this empirical observation about Japanese has the following implication for semantic theory: In order to enforce the Strong Familiarity Condition on Japanese NPs, a semantic theory requires some mechanism like file cards (Heim 1982; Vallduv 1992) for connecting up the informat...|$|E

40|$|The idea of ontological/logical {{pluralism}} {{raises an}} interesting question about the objectivity of arguments and argument forms: Are all arguments and argument forms domain dependent? In his recent work Bruno Latour outlines a radical form of ontological pluralism in which each domain or “mode of existence” has {{its own set of}} “felicity conditions” that serve as “veridiction” conditions unique to that mode. To “speak well” requires that one speak in the “interpretive key” proper to each mode.

Included among the various modes of existence are: Science, Politics, Law, Fiction, Technology, and others, with each mode having its own <b>felicity</b> <b>conditions.</b> This raises interesting questions about the status of arguments across modes.

40|$|This work {{examines}} {{the meaning of}} the Hindi particle ‘-hii’ and sheds new light on the link between modality and words like ‘only. ’ Our two new judgment studies reveal that ‘-hii’ indicates exclusivity (like 2 ̆ 7 only, 2 ̆ 7 and other similar lexical items) and also can associate with either the MIN or MAX of a scale of propositional alternatives.

Since existing analyses of 2 ̆ 7 only 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 even 2 ̆ 7 are insufficient for capturing the presuppositions of ‘-hii’ that are revealed by the experimental data, we draw on the recent theoretical literature on modality to map these ranking types of ‘-hii’ to epistemic, bouletic, and teleological modality types that form its core scalar <b>felicity</b> <b>condition.</b> Besides helping to formalize the varied types of speaker expectations needed by ‘-hii’, this move helps to explain some differences between the likelihood and desirability contexts 2 ̆ 7 patterning of data in our experimental results...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to {{contribute}} to the proper characterization of a <b>felicity</b> <b>condition</b> on the use of disjunctive sentences. Hurford [16] discovered that disjunctions pX∨Y q are infelicitous if their disjuncts stand in an entailment relation (eg. # John was born in Paris or in France). This condition, which we will refer to as ‘Hurford’s Constraint, ’ has since generated much discussion (eg. Gazdar [11], Simons [33], Singh [34], Chierchia, Fox, and Spector [3, 4], Katzir [19]). Chierchia, Fox, and Spector [4] (henceforth CFS) have used Hurford’s Constraint to argue that implicatures must sometimes be generated in embedded positions, for if they weren’t, sentences like (A or B) or (Both A and B) would be ruled out by the constraint. I will follow this line of reasoning in assuming that local implicatures can indeed rescue such disjunctions. However, I will argue that the constraint needs to be modified in two ways. First, I provide evidence that the rescue strategy of local implicature gen-eration is available only for earlier disjuncts, not for later ones (eg. # (Both A and B) or (A or B)). I will conclude from such data that the constraint is checked incrementally, in the left-right order of the disjuncts. Crucially, the incremental checking incorporates a timing principle whereby the constraint is checked before local implicatures have a chance to be generated. ∗For much helpful discussion on the thoughts presented here, I would like to thank Prana...|$|E

It is chosen since the teacher holds crucial roles to influence students. The teacher`s utterances stimulate student`s response and determine the activity which is done by students. In this case, learners practise the language by responding to what the teacher says. This research is aimed to find out the types and the functions of speech act used by a lecturer of English Language and Letters Department at Maulana Malik Ibrahim State Islamic University of Malang. This research used descriptive qualitative method to portray and clarify speech acts used by a lecturer of English Language and Letters Department. The data of this research are taken from classroom interaction. To analyze the data, the researcher identified the context of a lecturer`s utterance. Then the data also identified the types of speech act that was performed by the types of felicity conditions to show the appropriateness of condition when lecturer said an utterance and the types of speech act to find out locutionary act, illocutionary act and perlocutionary act. From the analysis, the researcher found the types of speech acts from the data that are fulfilled and analyzed using types of felicity conditions. The researcher found 18 data performed by the lecturer in the classroom. From the five types which belong to speech acts, the researcher found four types of speech acts. They are two data for representatives, seven data for directives, one data for commissives, eight data for expressive. After that, for the functions of the speech act performed by the lecturer`s utterances, the researcher found two functions of speech act, they are convivial and competitive. The researcher also suggested to the future researchers to continue conducting the research about speech acts which might contain declarative act of illocutionary because the researcher does not find declarative act in her research and find other types of speech acts that has crucial functions to the class.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} acquisition of the passive. The apparent cross-linguistic delay of the verbal passive compared to other constructions suggests children 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge is somehow restricted, leading some to propose the difficulty arises because of syntactic maturation (Wexler 2004, Orfitelli 2012) or because of a heavy reliance on discourse features assigned to arguments (Snyder and Hyams 2008). These hypotheses predict that until relevant mechanisms mature, children will only produce and comprehend a subset of passives (i. e., adjectival), or will only show adult-like performance when <b>felicity</b> <b>conditions</b> are met. Others have suggested children have not overcome the poverty of the stimulus for passives, arguing that frequency of passive in the input determines the timing of acquisition (Kline and Demuth 2010). The prediction of this account is that passive production and comprehension will vary cross-linguistically {{as a function of}} the primary linguistic data. ^ I argue against both the maturation and frequency accounts with data from English and Sesotho. In the Sesotho study, I show that 4 - 6 year old Sesotho-speaking children perform adult-like on certain types of unambiguously verbal passives. Furthermore, I show that Sesotho-speaking children perform no better on any type of passive than their English-speaking counterparts, although the frequency of passives in Sesotho child directed speech is ten times greater than in English. ^ The English study, a targeted grammaticality judgment task where <b>felicity</b> <b>conditions</b> are met, shows that 4 - 6 year-old English-speaking children accept passives with purpose phrases as grammatical, indicating they have verbal passive syntax.

50|$|Situations become ironic when an {{expectation}} is violated or otherwise invalidated in specific ways (Lucariello, 1994; Muecke, 1969). They explained that unexpectedness {{is a central}} property of ironic events. Glucksberg and Kreuz suggested that irony is used to remind of antecedent events, social norms, or shared expectations in order {{to call attention to}} a discrepancy between what is and what should have been. Glucksberg and Kreuz proposed the allusional pretense theory of irony to explain why sentences come off as ironic. The first part dealt with pragmatic insincerity, which occurs when a speaker is perceived as intentionally violating <b>felicity</b> <b>conditions</b> for at least of these aspects of an utterance. <b>Felicity</b> <b>conditions</b> were originally described by Austin (1962), but they were conditions that every utterance should satisfy in order to be a well-formed functioning speech act. The second part is that ironic utterances must allude to some prior expectation norm or convention that has been violated in one way or another. Similar to the experiments dealing with sarcasm, Glucksberg had participants read short stories that were intended to be ironic and some that were literal. These participants were then asked to judge how ironic the final remark was in each story. The potentially ironic stories participants mentioned that the speaker in the story did not sincerely intend what was said 69% of the time and alluded the listener's attention to some aspect of the situation 36% of the time. When compared to the literal stories, insincerity was mentioned 4% of the time and allusion 11% of the time. This data supports Glucksberg's theory, which is that what makes an expression ironic is not whether it is non-literal but rather if it is intended sincerely.|$|R

In the second part, we show how the speech act verbs form a structured set, which — in appropriate circumstances — could be used as an interpretative frame to create witchcraft events out of relatively trivial arguments within village communities. Here, we refer to Levinson's notion of activity types as a possible explanatory framework...|$|R

Even {{though these}} differ in detail or even broadly, they {{all agree that}} the following terms, or near-equivalents thereof are instrumential in investigating the nature of speech acts: locution, illocution, perlocution <b>felicity</b> <b>conditions,</b> sincerity conditions classification systems Moreover, all authors have expressed more or less elaborate views on how the coming-about of the act has to be understood. They likewise share a further feature: None of the named approaches defines a link to ordinary semantic theories {{in the tradition of}} Montague. This is noticeable, particularly as Bach and Harnish (1972) still list a wide and sophisticated range of open questions in semantics at the time as “issues that should be settled before a fully elaborated theory of speech acts can be given”...|$|R
5000|$|Magical rituals are the {{precisely}} defined actions (including speech) {{used to work}} magic. Bronisław Malinowski describes ritual {{language as}} possessing a high [...] "coefficient of weirdness" [...] in that the language used in rituals is archaic {{and out of the}} ordinary. This he ascribes to the need to create a mindset that fosters belief in the ritual. However, S. J. Tambiah notes that even if the power of the ritual is said to reside in the words, [...] "they only become effective if uttered in the special context of other actions." [...] These other actions typically consist of gestures, possibly performed with special objects at a particular place or time. The objects, locations, and performers may require purification beforehand, a condition that parallels the <b>felicity</b> <b>conditions</b> J. L. Austin requires of performative utterances.|$|R
40|$|Communicative acts {{in natural}} {{language}} dialogues {{can be regarded}} as intentional acts pcrfonncd by a dialogue participant to influence the relevant aspects of the menial stale of a recipient. In this paper a framework is discussed for deriving the beliefs and intentions of a speaker from a certain communicative act. To !his end, the act is expressed in terms of prosodic and textual features of the utterance and connected by means of default rules to the conditions that must be fulfilled by a speaker in order to perform the act felicitously. These conditions are expressed in terms of che beliefs and intentions of the speaker and may be compared with Searle's <b>felicity</b> <b>conditions</b> on speech acts. It is argued lhat some of the Scarlean conditions can be derived from a formalization of general principles of ralional behaviour in information dialogucs...|$|R
40|$|Austin's Speech Act Theory is a {{valuable}} tool {{for the analysis of}} a literary text. In interaction, the intentionand purpose-success of linguistic communication can be gauged by establishing whether participants have met <b>felicity</b> <b>conditions</b> and have respected maxims. When the Co-operative Principle is ignored, special effects are achieved and receivers can only make sense of utterances through implicature and inferences based on background knowledge and mutual contextual beliefs. In the drama, Buzani kubawo, characters interact on four levels of time in space and place. They reveal themselves and convey theme through their speech and actions. Conflict is entrenched by lines of force drawn between opposing characters and between sub-worlds contrasted. Cohesion, determined by plot structure, and form, expressed on the endophoric and exophoric levels, give meaning to the drama. The micro-analysis of the wedding scene illustrates how communication can misfire should the playwright allow it!African LanguagesM. A. (African languages...|$|R
