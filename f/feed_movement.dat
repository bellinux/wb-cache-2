Ontogenetically and phylogenetically feeding tasks precede speaking tasks {{and it has been}} hypothesised that speaking movements constitute a subset of <b>feeding</b> <b>movements.</b> From ElectroMagnetic Articulography data we have extracted two estimates of the degrees of freedom of the tongue, one from a speech task and one from a feeding task. These have been used to build two corresponding articulatory models. For both tasks, about 95 % of the tongue variance can be explained by 4 parameters. Contrary to the accepted behaviour for speech, for feeding tasks, the tip, mid and back regions of the tongue appear to be controlled independently. The reconstruction errors of speech and feeding articulations by the two models show slightly better efficiency for the feeding model, suggesting that the speech movements might realistically be considered a subset of the <b>feeding</b> <b>movements...</b>|$|R

40|$|The nudibranch Melibe leonine feeds {{using the}} rhythmic {{movements}} of its large oral hood to capture small crustaceans that {{are present in}} the water column. The frequency of these <b>feeding</b> <b>movements,</b> or hood closures, is proportional to the concentration of available prey. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine what qualities of prey cause the rate of these <b>feeding</b> <b>movements</b> to change. Animals were observed during exposure to the following treatments: (1) filtered seawater; (2) Artemia-conditioned seawater (smell); (3) small particles in seawater; (4) particles soaked in Artemia-conditioned seawater; (5) frozen Artemia and; (6) live Artemia. Both conditioned water and particles caused appetitive behavior (orientation of the oral hood) and a significant increase in the frequency of hood closures. This incrase in rate had a rapid onset and was maintained throughout the duration of the 20 -min test period. The major difference between the effects of the two stimuli was that smell alone led to incomplete feeding cycles while particle treatments yielded normal feeding behavior. When applied together these stimuli produced a larger response than either one did alone. However, no combination of stimuli was as effective as live prey. We conclude that both tactile and chemical cues are sufficient to elicit an increase in the <b>feeding</b> <b>movements</b> of Melibe leonine, but some additional stimulus provided by live prey, such as vibrations, may play an important role as well. The information provided by these stimuli helps initiate appetitive and early aspects of the consummartory phases of feeding, and also influences full expression of the rhythmic feeding motor program...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{finishing}} of precise bores is {{an important}} machining step, especially in the automotive industries. Bores can vary in diameter and form, from bigger piston bores in motor cylinders to rather small bores in fuel injection systems. Quality parameters for these bores are form- and geometric accuracy as well as surface roughness and structure. All requirements can economically be met by using the honing process as the final finishing operation for readymade bores. Honing is an abrasive machining process using abrasive grains usually made of diamond or Cubic Boron Nitride (CBN) in metallic bonding. During the process three movement components, namely an axial movement along the bore axis, a rotational movement around the bore axis and the <b>feeding</b> <b>movement</b> of the honing stone, are combined. The <b>feeding</b> <b>movement</b> of the honing stone is induced by an axial <b>movement</b> of the <b>feeding</b> cone, which is translated into a radial movement of the honing stone at the interface between honing stone and work piece. The <b>feeding</b> <b>movement</b> is decisive {{for the results of}} the honing process. For a regulation of the process that enables high process stability and repeatability as well as good quality results from the first part {{it is important to know}} about the forces in the feeding system of the tool. The following paper describes the static and dynamic correlation of the process forces in order to give a basis for a new regulation approach especially for bores with smaller diameters (below 20 mm) where the direct measurement of the process forces with a tool- integrated sensor is difficult. Measured signals are investigated for their dynamic influences. The theoretical approach is then compared to signals measured during the process...|$|R

40|$|SYNOPSIS. Based on {{studies of}} a few model taxa, {{amphibians}} have been consid-ered stereotyped in their <b>feeding</b> <b>movements</b> relative to other vertebrates. How-ever, recent studies {{on a wide variety}} of amphibian species have revealed great diversity in feeding mechanics and kinematics, and illustrate that stereotypy is the exception rather than the rule in amphibian feeding. Apparent stereotypy in some taxa may be an artifact of unnatural laboratory conditions. The common ancestor of lissamphibians was probably capable of some modulation of <b>feeding</b> <b>movements,</b> and descendants have evolved along two trajectories with regard to motor control: (1) an increase in modulation via feedback or feed-forward mechanisms, as ex-emplified by ballistic-tongued plethodontid salamanders and hydrostatic-tongued frogs, and (2) a decrease in variation dictated by biomechanics that require tight coordination between different body parts, such as the tongue and jaws in toads and other frogs with ballistic tongue projection. Multi-joint coordination of rapid movements may hamper accurate tongue placement in ballistic-tongued frogs as compared to both short-tongued frogs and ballistic tongued-salamanders that face simpler motor control tasks. Decoupling of tongue and jaw movements is associated with increased accuracy in both hydrostatic-tongued frogs and ballistic-tongued salamanders...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHoning is an {{abrasive}} {{machining process}} that can produce very exact results regarding geometry, form and surface quality of the honed work piece. It is mainly used as the final finishing operation for ready-made bores and has to meet high demands regarding process stability and repeatability. As it can create a high ratio of bearing contact area to total area together with a high surface quality it is often used for highly stressed parts. During the process, the honing tool combines three movement components: a rotation around the tool axis, an oscillation along the tool axis and a radial <b>feeding</b> <b>movement</b> of the honing stone. The interface between honing stone and workpiece {{and the movement of}} the honing stone are very important for the process. Nowadays, there are two different control strategies for the <b>feeding</b> <b>movement</b> of the honing stone: feed-controlled and force-controlled honing. While force- controlled honing tries to keep a constant process force, feed-controlled honing feeds the honing stone in certain steps in certain time intervals. The force-controlled approach can bring better results of the process regarding the quality parameters and the tool wear. But to be able to hone force-controlled the correlation of the process forces has to be known. This paper presents a first theoretical approach to the relations beweeen the forces during the honing process. Some parameters that are needed for the calculation are derived from experimental results...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHoning is a {{machining}} {{process that can}} economically produce very exact bores regarding form, geometry and surface quality. It is mainly used as the final finishing operation for ready made parts and typically conducted on the inner surface of a cylinder. Due to their specific surface structure which has a good ability to keep lubricants and a high wear resistance, honed parts usually serve as functional surfaces to guide moved parts. Today, the main fields for applications of honing technology {{can be found in}} most sectors of the metal working industry, e. g. the automotive industries, hydraulic and pneumatic manufacture and aircraft industries. During the long-stroke honing process the tool, equipped with one or several abrasive honing stones, is performing three overlaying movement components. These are a rotational movement, an oscillating stroke movement in axial direction and the radial <b>feed</b> <b>movement</b> of the honing stone. This <b>feed</b> <b>movement</b> is one of the decisive factors for the results of the honing process. It can be realized through feed control or, in a more recent approach, through force control strategies. By feed controlled honing, the position of the honing stone is changed in defined invariable steps in certain time intervals. In contrast, by force controlled honing the force of the honing stone {{against the wall of the}} workpiece is measured indirectly by a force sensor, which is located within the feed unit of the honing machine. A required force value is given and, if necessary, the honing stone is fed outwards to reach and maintain a constant cutting force throughout the honing process. This constant force is supposed to produce better results of the honing process in terms of geometric and form accuracy as well as surface structure. The presented research studies aim at improving process know-how to further increase the production accuracy and process repeatability. In a comparison between parts honed with the two different feeding strategies for the honing stone, force components and moments were analyzed and correlated to the phases of the process and several influencing parameters. In addition to the forces and moments measured during the honing process, the quality parameters of the honed parts have also been analyzed and compared...|$|E
