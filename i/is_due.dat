50|$|A {{review of}} common factors {{research}} in 2008 suggested that 30% to 70% {{of the variance}} in therapy outcome <b>was</b> <b>due</b> to common factors. A summary of research in 2014 suggested that 11.5% of variance in therapy outcome <b>was</b> <b>due</b> to the common factor of goal consensus/collaboration, 9% <b>was</b> <b>due</b> to empathy, 7.5% <b>was</b> <b>due</b> to therapeutic alliance, 6.3% <b>was</b> <b>due</b> to positive regard/affirmation, 5.7% <b>was</b> <b>due</b> to congruence/genuineness, and 5% <b>was</b> <b>due</b> to therapist factors; in contrast, treatment method accounted for roughly 1% of outcome variance.|$|R

5|$|Bewick's art is {{considered}} the pinnacle of his medium, now called wood engraving.

The increase in growth rate to 50 per cent from 1971 to 1981 <b>is</b> <b>due</b> to the city's upgrade to a municipal corporation in 1974 and the subsequent inclusion of 13 Panchayats into the corporation limits. The decline in the population growth rate between 1981 and 2001 <b>is</b> <b>due</b> to the bifurcation of Madurai district into two, Madurai and Dindigul in 1984, and the subsequently of part of the city into the Theni district in 1997.

Máel Coluim's first wife, Ingibiorg Finnsdottir, was the niece of Harald III of Norway, and it has been argued by Alex Woolf that the tradition of a battle between the Scots and Norwegians <b>is</b> <b>due</b> to a Scandinavian involvement on the side of Máel Coluim.|$|E
