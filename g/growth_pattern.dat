5|$|The {{flesh is}} reddish or purplish-brown with white flecks. Initially spongy and soft, it becomes tough and corky as the fruit body matures. In the stipe, the flesh can become blackish in age. Like other Hydnellum species, fruit body tissue {{is made of}} {{generative}} hyphae that do not expand. This slows {{the growth of the}} fruit body, often enabling it to persist for several months. The fungus employs an indeterminate <b>growth</b> <b>pattern,</b> in which the fruit body formation begins from a vertical column of hyphae that eventually expand at the top to form the cap. Any solid objects encountered during growth, such as grass or twigs, can be enveloped by the expanding fruit body. Similarly, closely neighboring caps can fuse together during growth.|$|E

Though they noted that these eggs strongly resemble M. yaotunensis, they declined to refer them to any ootaxon lower than Elongatoolithidae because Macroolithus is not clearly defined and {{is in need of}} revision. The embryos within these eggs {{are some of the most}} well-preserved of any oviraptorids, providing new information on oviraptorid ontogeny. The specimens show a relatively shallow head which indicates that as oviraptorids matured, their skulls grew dorsoventrally (top-to-bottom) faster than anteroposteriorly (front-to-back). This <b>growth</b> <b>pattern</b> is unusual among theropods, but is also seen in derived ("advanced") tyrannosaurids. Also unusual is that, even at this early stage of development, the nasal bones are fused. Coincidentally, tyrannosaurids also show fusion of the nasals early in development.|$|E

5|$|Webs are {{typically}} established in low-growing dune plants and other vegetation {{such as the}} native Pingao (Desmoschoenus spiralis) or the introduced marram grass (Ammophila arenaria). They may also build their webs under driftwood, stones, or other debris such as empty tin cans or bottles. Webs are almost always constructed over open sand and near the ground so as to catch crawling insects for food. Spiders inhabiting dune grasses construct their webs in open spaces between the grass tufts, while spiders inhabiting areas of shrubbery do so {{on the underside of}} a plant overhanging open sand. It has been found that these patches of open sand are necessary for katipo to build their webs as plants that envelop sand dunes in dense cover, such as exotic plants like kikuyu or buffalo grass, create an environment unsuitable for web construction. The katipo therefore prefers to spin its web amongst pingao plants as this plants <b>growth</b> <b>pattern</b> leaves patches of sand between each plant. The wind can then blow insects and other prey through these gaps and into the web. Marram grass has been extensively planted in New Zealand to help stabilise sand dunes and has largely replaced pingao in many areas. Because marram grass grows in a very tight formation only leaving small gaps between tuffs, this makes it difficult for the katipo to construct a suitable web for capturing prey.|$|E

25|$|The unusual {{lifestyle}} and <b>growth</b> <b>pattern</b> of Kiryas Joel {{has led to}} litigation {{on a number of}} fronts. In 1994, the Supreme Court ruled in the case of Board of Education of Kiryas Joel Village School District v. Grumet that the Kiryas Joel school district, which covered only the village, was designed in violation of the Establishment Clause of the 1st Amendment, because the design accommodated one group on the basis of religious affiliation. Subsequently, the New York State Legislature established a similar school district in the village that has passed legal muster. Further litigation has resulted over what entity should pay for the education of children with disabilities in Kiryas Joel, and over whether the community's boys must ride buses driven by women. A case against the village is currently pending in federal district court; plaintiffs, who are asking for the village to be dissolved, say that Kiryas Joel is a theocracy whose existence violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, where local government leaders abuse the laws, such as those for tax-exempt status, zoning, and sanitation, to favor members of their own sect and persecute other Orthodox Jews. They also say that the leaders commit vote fraud by intimidating dissident voters and busing in non-residents.|$|E

50|$|There exists little {{information}} {{of the specific}} <b>growth</b> <b>patterns</b> of Odontocyclops. However, by examining general dicynodont <b>growth</b> <b>patterns,</b> an understanding of a similar patterns can be inferred for Odontocyclops. Dicynodonts are characterized by a predominance of fibrolamellar bone tissue in the cortex. Fibroamellar bone is associated with rapid osteogenesis, therefore, {{it is suggested that}} dicynodonts exhibited fast bone <b>growth.</b> Another <b>pattern</b> of <b>growth</b> in some dicynodonts, including the closest relatives of Odontocyclops, is rapid growth as a juvenile followed by a decrease in growth rate with age. Once again, the available specimen sample size is too small to make definite conclusions about <b>growth</b> <b>patterns</b> of Odontocyclops. However, one of the specimens presumed to be a juvenile is lacking large nasal bosses, suggesting that this is a feature obtained later in life.|$|R
500|$|Similar to all non-avian dinosaurs {{studied to}} date, Plateosaurus grew {{in a pattern}} that is unlike that of both extant mammals and birds. In the closely related sauropods with their typical dinosaurian physiology, growth was {{initially}} rapid, continuing somewhat more slowly well beyond sexual maturity, but was determinate, i.e. the animals stopped growing at a maximum size. Mammals grow rapidly, but sexual maturity falls typically {{at the end of}} the rapid growth phase. In both groups, the final size is relatively constant, with humans atypically variable. Extant reptiles show a sauropod-like <b>growth</b> <b>pattern,</b> initially rapid, then slowing after sexual maturity, and almost, but not fully, stopping in old age. However, their initial growth rate is much lower than in mammals, birds and dinosaurs. The reptilian growth rate is also very variable, so that individuals of the same age may have very different sizes, and final size also varies significantly. In extant animals, this <b>growth</b> <b>pattern</b> is linked to behavioural thermoregulation and a low metabolic rate (i.e. ectothermy), and is called [...] "developmental plasticity". (Note that is not the same as neural developmental plasticity).|$|E

500|$|During the summer, the sharptooth houndshark forms {{groups in}} shallow water. These aggregations are {{particularly}} well-documented in False Bay {{and may be}} related to reproduction, given the presence of many pregnant females. It is aplacental viviparous, with the developing embryos nourished mainly by yolk. Mature females have a single functional ovary and two functional uteruses. Litters of 6–12 pups are birthed between late May and August, following a gestation period of some 20 months. Larger females tend to produce larger litters. The length at birth has been variously estimated as [...] and [...] by different sources; pups within a single litter may vary in size by up to 30%. Females apparently reproduce either every two years or every three years, depending on whether she has ovarian eggs developing during the pregnancy that would allow her to mate again within a few months of giving birth.

500|$|Various other {{cellular}} automata {{are known}} to support replicators, patterns that make copies of themselves, with the same behavior as in the tree growth model for Rule 90. A new copy is placed {{to either side of}} the replicator pattern, as long as the space there is empty. However, if two replicators both attempt to copy themselves into the same position, then the space remains blank. In either case the replicators themselves vanish, leaving their copies to carry on the replication. A standard example of this behavior is the [...] "bowtie pasta" [...] pattern in the two-dimensional HighLife rule. This rule behaves in many ways like Conway's Game of Life, but such a small replicator does not exist in Life. Whenever an automaton supports replicators with the same <b>growth</b> <b>pattern,</b> one-dimensional arrays of replicators can be used to simulate Rule 90.
