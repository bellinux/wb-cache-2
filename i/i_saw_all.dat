Lauryn was {{in the living room}} next to the studio with about fifteen Marley grandchildren around her, the children of Ziggy, and Stephen, and Julian, and she starts singing this rap verse, and all the kids start repeating the last word of each line, chiming in very spontaneously because they were so into the song." [...] Columbia Records considered bringing in an outside producer for the album and had early talks with RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan. However, Hill was adamant about writing, arranging, and producing the album herself: [...] "It would have been more difficult to articulate to other people. Hey, it's my album. Who can tell my story better than me?" [...] She recalled Ruffhouse Records executive Chris Swartz ensuring her artistic freedom while recording the album: [...] "I had total control of the album. Chris Swartz at Ruffhouse, my label, said, 'Listen, you've never done anything stupid thus far, so let me let you do your thing.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The season's only loss came to Minnesota {{in a close}} 7–6 game. Frutig nearly won {{the game}} for Michigan as he blocked a George Franck punt, which Reuben Kelto {{recovered}} on the Minnesota three-yard line. But Minnesota intercepted Harmon's pass in the end zone, and Michigan lost by one point. Harmon had also missed a point after touchdown kick earlier in the game. Despite the loss, one columnist said of Frutig's performance against Minnesota: “The best end <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>all</b> year I saw in this game. That was Frutig of Michigan and that goes for offense and defense. He ruined about six coming in there trying to block those Gopher punts. He did block one.” ...|$|E

Pickler says she first {{decided to go}} vegetarian for health reasons, but a TV ad that vegetarian Pamela Anderson did for animal rights group PETA piqued her curiosity. [...] "One night I couldn't sleep and I was up and just Googling random stuff and I'm like, 'Hmmm, PETA.' <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>all</b> the videos and I {{just thought it was}} horrible.

During a meeting with Pope John Paul II at the Vatican in 1987, they clashed on the issue of wealth disparity, with Maradona stating, [...] "I argued with him because I was in the Vatican and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>all</b> these golden ceilings and afterwards I heard the Pope say the Church was worried about the welfare of poor kids. Sell your ceiling then amigo, do something!" [...] In September 2014, Maradona met with Pope Francis in Rome, crediting Francis for inspiring him to return to religion after many years; he stated, [...] "We should all imitate Pope Francis.

2500|$|E: Yes, I {{did not do}} it consciously. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>all</b> the sunset, but I didn't see {{the fence}} and large boulder that were there. I blocked out {{everything}} except the sunset. After I saw the sunset, I lost consciousness for three days. When I finally awakened, I asked my father why they had taken out that fence, tree, and boulder. I did not realize I had blotted them out when I fixed my attention so intensely on the sunset. Then, as I recovered and became aware of my lack of abilities, I wondered how I was going to earn a living. I had already published a paper in a national agricultural journal. [...] "Why Young Folks Leave the Farm." [...] I no longer had the strength to be a farmer, but maybe I could make it as a doctor.|$|E

The band decided they wanted influential rock producer Jay Baumgardner on board to produce the record. In an interview with HitQuarters, Baumgardner said, “At first I wasn’t really convinced it would work out, but then I saw a video of them performing at a club - <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>all</b> these kids going wild, knowing the songs by heart - and that’s when I realized that they definitely had potential.” ...|$|E

2500|$|While I {{was hearing}} the boys’ confessions {{on the evening}} of the 5th [...] I was {{suddenly}} terrorized by the sight of a celestial person who presented himself to my mind’s eye. He had in his hand a sort of weapon like a very long sharp-pointed steel blade which seemed to emit fire. At the very instant that <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>all</b> this, I saw that person hurl the weapon into my soul with all his might. I cried out with difficulty and felt I was dying. I asked the boy to leave because I felt ill and no longer had the strength to continue. This agony lasted uninterruptedly until the morning of the 7th. I cannot tell you how much I suffered during this period of anguish. Even my entrails were torn and ruptured by the weapon, and nothing was spared. From that day on I have been mortally wounded. I feel in the depths of my soul a wound that is always open and which causes me continual agony.|$|E

2500|$|One official, Back Judge Adrian Burk, {{signaled}} that {{the play was}} a touchdown, but the other game officials did not immediately make any signal. When the officials huddled, Burk and another official, Umpire Pat Harder, thought that the play was a touchdown because Tatum and Fuqua had both touched the ball, while three others {{said that they were}} {{not in a position to}} rule. Referee Fred Swearingen approached Steelers sideline official Jim Boston and asked to be taken to a telephone. Boston took Swearingen to a baseball dugout in the stadium. There was a video monitor in the dugout, but it was not used by Swearingen. (Terry Bradshaw's assertion that a special television was rigged up on the sideline so that Swearingen could watch the replay is not supported by other accounts.) From the dugout telephone Boston put in a call to the press box to reach the NFL's supervisor of officials, Art McNally. Before the call McNally had [...] "an opinion from the get-go" [...] that the ball had hit Tatum's chest, which he confirmed by looking [...] "at one shot on instant replay." [...] In the press box the telephone was answered either by Dan Rooney, son of Steelers owner Art Rooney, or by Steelers public relations director Joe Gordon (reports vary), and McNally was put on the line. According to McNally, Swearingen [...] "never asked me about the rule, and never asked what <b>I</b> <b>saw.</b> <b>All</b> he said was, 'Two of my men say that opposing players touched the ball.' And I said, 'everything's fine then, go ahead.'" [...] After Swearingen hung up the phone Boston asked, [...] "What do we got?" [...] "We got a touchdown," [...] answered Swearingen, who then went back onto the field to signal the ruling to the crowd. Franco Harris crossed the goal line at approximately 3:29 PM EST. Fans immediately rushed the field, and it took 15 minutes to clear them so that the extra point could be kicked to give the Steelers what turned out to be their final margin of victory, 13–7.|$|E
