50|$|The cat was {{recognized}} as the natural reservoir of the disease in 1950 by Robert Debré. Kittens {{are more likely to}} carry the bacteria in their blood, and therefore {{may be more likely to}} transmit the disease than adult cats. However, fleas serve as a vector for transmission of B. henselae among cats, and viable B. henselae are excreted in the feces of Ctenocephalides felis, the cat flea. Cats could be infected with B. henselae through <b>intradermal</b> <b>inoculation</b> using flea feces containing B. henselae. As a consequence, a likely means of transmission of B. henselae from cats to humans may be inoculation with flea feces containing B. henselae through a contaminated cat scratch wound or by cat saliva transmitted in a bite. Ticks can also act as vectors and occasionally transmit the bacteria to humans. Combined clinical and PCR-based research has shown that other organisms can transmit Bartonella, including spiders. Cryptic Bartonella infection may be a much larger problem than previously thought, constituting an unrecognized occupational health hazard of veterinarians.|$|E

40|$|A {{method has}} been {{described}} by which it is possible to estimate the number of particles of vaccine virus which are required to cause infection in the rabbit skin. The method consists essentially in performing a series of <b>intradermal</b> <b>inoculations</b> in rabbits of suitably diluted virus suspensions. The percentage of inoculations at each dilution giving rise to lesions is observed, and the data are subjected to appropriate statistical analysis. Several strains of vaccine virus, differing in their characteristics, have been studied with the following results.

The same is true for the strain derived from it but cultured in a chick embryo-Tyrode solution medium for a prolonged period. This strain, as has been noted, has largely lost its ability to cause extensive necrosis in the rabbit skin, and causes generalized infection only exceptionally. From the results here reported, it appears that other factors are responsible for the altered character of the lesion than the ability of the virus to establish a foothold in the animal organism.

The desired conjugate, obtained in nearly 50 % yield relative to input of fragment A, was purified by affinity chromatography on Sephacryl S- 200 and NAD-Sepharose; on analysis, it gave an average of 1. 4 molecules of fragment A per tetrameric Con A molecule. The conjugate proved to be about equally active in inhibiting protein synthesis in HeLa, CHO, or SV 3 T 3 cells in culture but was inactive relative to controls in a toxin-resistant strain of CHO cells containing altered elongation factor 2, the target protein of fragment A. With toxin-sensitive strains the conjugate was 100 - to 1000 -fold more active than controls, including fragment A, cystaminyl-Con A, and mixtures thereof, but was 1 / 50 th to 1 / 500 th as toxic as diphtheria toxin itself.

Control medium caused slight cellular reaction, mostly polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNs), but no significant increase in skinfold thickness. SK/SD provoked no reaction. PHA stimulated a marked increase in skinfold thickness; the cellular reaction was predominantly PMNs, with some macrophages occurring after several days. IFA and CFA promoted a long-lasting increase in skinfold thickness, and a mixed histological picture of PMNs and macrophages; later in the response, especially to CFA, giant cells and some lymphocytes occurred. PPD stimulated a small increase in skinfold thickness with a timing (2 - 3 days) consistent with delayed hypersensitivity (DTH); there was, however, no erythema or palpable oedema or induration.

Application of infectious material to the scarified skin did not always induce verruga lesions, but <b>intradermal</b> <b>inoculation</b> almost invariably gave rise to nodule formation. The localization of Bartonella bacilliformis in the skin is not, in experimental animals, determined by mechanical factors, since scarification of the skin or intradermal injection of foreign substances in monkeys infected with Bartonella bacilliformis does not give rise to verruga formation. The degree of susceptibility of the skin tissues appears to be considerably diminished during the course of experimental infection with Bartonella bacilliformis. Inoculation of the scarified skin of infected animals gave uniformly negative results, and <b>intradermal</b> <b>inoculation</b> induced only a mild local reaction. In a few exceptional instances, however, of animals previously infected with the strain of Bartonella bacilliformis derived from a human verruga nodule, reinoculation with the same strain gave rise to unusually marked reactions.

In the initial stage the lesion is a pure angioendothelioma, but in the stage of full development the histological picture is complicated by connective tissue proliferation and occasionally also by penetration of epidermis into the lesion.

The third group was left untreated as the control. All of the pigs were challenged intranasally with a virulent PRV strain and they were subsequently injected with dexamethasone. Two pigs in each group were necropsied on days 5 and 15 after dexamethasone inoculation. The challenge exposure resulted in mild clinical signs, increase in growth and a shorter period of virus shedding in vaccinated pigs, whereas the control group showed severe signs of Aujeszky's disease. No difference in the titre of the virulent virus which was excreted by pigs of all three groups, was observed and all animals seroconverted. Both the mutant strain and the wild-type virus established a latent infection although only the latter was reactivated and shed. Slight lesions were observed in target tissues of the vaccinated animals and {{no significant differences were}} detected between the two inoculation schedules...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSingle <b>intradermal</b> or {{intramuscular}} <b>inoculations</b> of GM-CSF DNA {{with the}} DNA prime for a simian–human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) - 89. 6 vaccine, {{which consists of}} DNA priming followed by modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) boosting, increased protection of both the blood and intestines against the acute phase of an intrarectal SHIV- 89. 6 P challenge. GM-CSF appeared to contribute to protection by enhancing two antibody responses: the avidity maturation of anti-Env IgG in blood (p=< 0. 01) {{and the presence of}} long lasting anti-viral IgA in rectal secretions (p< 0. 01). The avidity of anti-Env IgG showed strong correlations with protection both pre and post challenge. Animals with the highest avidity anti-Env Ab had 1000 -fold reductions in peak viremia over those with the lowest avidity anti-Env Ab. The enhanced IgA response was associated with the best protection, but did not achieve significance...|$|R
