5|$|On August 29th 2005, flood {{walls and}} levees catastrophically failed {{throughout}} the metro area. Many collapsed well below design thresholds (17th Street and London Canals). Others collapsed {{after a brief}} period of overtopping (Industrial Canal) caused “scouring” or erosion of the earthen levee walls. In eastern New Orleans, levees along the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway failed in several places because they were built with sand and <b>erodible</b> materials instead of clay, an obvious construction flaw.|$|E
5|$|Two soil {{associations}} {{exist in}} the Ithan Creek watershed. The Neshaminy-Lehigh-Glenlg soil association is present in {{a small part of}} the watershed. It consists of silty, well drained, gravelly, and deep soil that rests on gabbro and granodiorite bedrock. The Chester-Glenlg-Manor soil association is prevalent through the middle of the watershed. It consists of silty, channery, and shallow to deep soil that rests on brown schist and gneiss bedrock. Most of the watershed is considered to have slightly <b>erodible</b> soil.|$|E
5|$|Three soil {{associations}} {{exist in}} the Darby Creek watershed. The Neshaminy-Lehigh-Glenlg soil association is prevalent in the northwest part of the watershed. It consists of silty, well drained, gravelly, and deep soil that rests on gabbro and granodiorite bedrock. The Chester-Glenlg-Manor soil association is prevalent throughout the watershed except in its lower reaches. It consists of silty, channery, and shallow to deep soil that rests on brown schist and gneiss bedrock. The Urban Land-Wetbrook-Pitts soil association is prevalent {{in the southern part}} of the watershed. It consists of silty, sandy, and deep soil that rests on coastal sediments. Roughly 53% of the land in the Darby Creek watershed is classified as having slightly <b>erodible</b> soil.|$|E
25|$|It was {{concluded}} that the bridge collapsed due to extensive scour under pier three. The foundation of the pier was bearing on <b>erodible</b> soil, consisting of layers of gravel, sand and silt, inter-bedded with folded and tilted till. This allowed high velocity flood waters to penetrate the bearing stratum. The area left around the footing was not filled with riprap stone, but instead was back-filled with <b>erodible</b> soil and topped off with dry riprap. Riprap protection, inspection, and maintenance were determined to have been inadequate.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{critical}} factor that determines whether a stream will meander or braid is bank erodibility. A stream with cohesive banks that {{are resistant to}} erosion will form narrow, deep, meandering channels, whereas a stream with highly <b>erodible</b> banks will form wide, shallow channels, sustaining helical flow and resulting {{in the formation of}} braided channels.|$|E
25|$|After {{the first}} stage of {{aggradation}} and sediment transport, the Kobuk began a new phase of erosion and landform development. The river exhausted its supply of easily <b>erodible</b> sediment upstream, thus decreasing its sediment load and increasing its load carrying capacity downstream. With more capacity downstream, the river began to incise into the alluvial fan it previously created, moving sediment stored for a long time on its original floodplains to newer floodplains even further downstream.|$|E
25|$|The volcano {{has never}} grown very large between eruptions, because it {{produces}} mostly unwelded, easily <b>erodible</b> deposits and periodically destroys the viscous domes that fill its vents. After the Buag eruption (c. 1500 AD), the volcano lay dormant, its slopes becoming completely covered in dense rainforest and eroded into gullies and ravines. The c. 500-year repose though between the Buag and present eruptive periods {{is among the}} shorter repose periods recognized in its geologic history.|$|E
25|$|Hoodoo Mountain lies {{in an area}} of high {{elevation}} ecosystems colonizing very <b>erodible</b> substrate. The {{mountain is}} generally poorly forested due to its high altitude and remote alpine location. This mountainous terrain has made Hoodoo Mountain a site for alpine tundra. Even though alpine tundra lacks trees, Hoodoo's lower flanks contain mountain hemlock. Because alpine tundra is located in various widely separated regions on Earth, there is no animal species common to all areas of alpine tundra.|$|E
25|$|Topographical feature {{divide the}} Belizean {{landscape}} into two main physiographic regions. The most visually striking of these regions is distinguished by the Maya Mountains {{and the associated}} basins and plateaus that dominate all but the narrow coastal plain in the southern half of the country. The mountains rise to heights of about 1,100 metres, with the highest point being Doyle's Delight (1,124 m) in the Cockscomb Range, a spur of the Maya Mountains in Western Belize. Covered with shallow, highly <b>erodible</b> soils of low fertility, these heavily forested highlands are very sparsely inhabited.|$|E
25|$|The non-Schochary geology of the Nature Preserve {{is of the}} Martinsburg Formation, predominately made up of New Tripoli Member. The Martinsburg Formation {{developed}} during the Ordovician period (490 to 443 million years ago), and is characterized by dark grey shale and thin beds of siltstone and sandstone, with depths up to 12,000feet. The New Tripoli group, the dominant geologic member in the preserve, is composed of shale and calcareous turbidites with sedimentary characteristics. Shale is largely impervious to water producing high surface runoff, but its weak structure is highly <b>erodible,</b> resulting in gentle slopes.|$|E
25|$|As {{the glacier}} first retreated and melted, {{large amounts of}} highly <b>erodible,</b> {{fine-grained}} sediment dropped out in relatively high mountain valleys. The availability of this fine-grained, loose sediment combined with a high gradient to turn a newly forming Kobuk River into a fast-working sediment transport system. The river picked up glacial till from its upper reaches and transported it downstream until the gradient diminished. When the river encountered flatter ground, it deposited its sediment load resulting {{in the creation of}} broad, flat floodplains, alluvial fans, and meander bends through aggradation.|$|E
25|$|Jari Dam {{is also an}} earthfill type with silt as {{the core}} material. Gravel is applied on the {{shoulders}} of the dam. The maximum height of Jari dam above the core trench is 274 feet and the length is 6,800 feet. The main spillway is a submerged orifice type with 9 radial gates, 36 x 40 feet each; it has a maximum capacity of 1.1 million cusecs. The emergency spillway is weir type with an <b>erodible</b> bund and a maximum capacity of 0.23 million cusecs. The 5 tunnels are steel and concrete lined and 1,560 feet long in bedrock. The internal diameter ranges between 26 and 31 feet.|$|E
25|$|Tai Lam Country Park sits in {{the western}} New Territories with an area of 54km². Tai Lam has a small area of {{porphyry}} in the northeast; for the remaining area, it is composed of highly <b>erodible</b> decomposed granite. In 1952, afforestation started as a measure to protect the water catchment area. In spite of the poor soil conditions and the setbacks of fire damage over the years, mature stands of Acacia confusa, Lophostemon confertus, Pinus massoniana, Pinus elliottii and Eucalyptus species now cover most of the area. In addition, the plantations also offer a good habitat for birds, pangolins, Chinese leopard cat, and barking deer. Nevertheless, Tai Lam is an excellent place for outdoor activities because of its remoteness.|$|E
500|$|Under ideal {{conditions}} (uniform gentle slope on a homogeneously <b>erodible</b> substrate), the sinuosity of a meandering river approaches [...] The sinuosity is the ratio between the actual length and the straight-line distance from source to mouth. Faster currents along the outside edges of a river's bends cause more erosion than along the inside edges, thus pushing the bends even farther out, {{and increasing the}} overall loopiness of the river. However, that loopiness eventually causes the river to double back on itself in places and [...] "short-circuit", creating an ox-bow lake in the process. The balance between these two opposing factors leads to an average ratio of [...] between the actual length and the direct distance between source and mouth.|$|E
500|$|The River Irwell {{catchment}} area {{extends from the}} moors above Bacup to the Manchester Ship Canal. The climate of the {{catchment area}} is wetter than the UK average, with rainfall of [...] per annum compared to [...] per annum, and the rivers quickly respond to rainfall. The topography varies considerably, with the upper reaches dominated by the Pennine moors {{at an altitude of}} between [...] and [...] AOD and the bottom of the catchment consisting of relatively flat land, which lies between [...] and [...] AOD. The watercourses are characterised by steep narrow valleys, which contributes to high rates of run-off, as does the underlying solid geology. This comprises Lower Coal Measures overlying Millstone Grit, both of which are classified as minor aquifers which will only hold relatively small amounts of water. The Millstone Grit is, in turn, underlain by limestone rocks from the lower Carboniferous period. [...] The surface deposits comprise thick peat in the upper reaches, with glacial boulder clay and glacial sand and gravel in the lower parts. The sand and gravel are also classified as a minor aquifer, whilst the boulder clay is a non-aquifer. The higher, steeper slopes of {{the upper part of the}} catchment provide a large source of <b>erodible</b> material and debris which is transported downstream to the lower, flatter parts of the catchment. Where the channel is constricted, this material is then deposited and can contribute to a reduction in channel capacity.|$|E
