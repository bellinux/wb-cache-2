40|$|We {{have been}} {{investigating}} the cryptographical properties of in nite families of simple graphs of large girth {{with the special}} colouring of vertices during the last 10 years.

Only few families of simple graphs of large unbounded girth and arbitrarily large degree are known. The paper is devoted to the more general theory of directed graphs of large girth and their cryptographical applications. It contains new explicit algebraic constructions of in finite families of such graphs. We show that they can be used for the implementation of secure and very fast symmetric encryption algorithms.

40|$|Background The {{purpose of}} this review was to {{determine}} the most valid and reliable questions for targeting <b>key</b> <b>modes</b> of sedentary behaviour (SB) in a broad range of national and international health surveillance surveys. This was done by reviewing the SB modules currently used in population health surveys, as well as examining SB questionnaires that have performed well in psychometric testing. Methods Health surveillance surveys were identified via scoping review and contact with experts in the field. Previous systematic reviews provided psychometric information on pediatric questionnaires. A comprehensive search of four bibliographic databases was used to identify studies reporting psychometric information for adult questionnaires. Only surveys/studies published/used in English or French were included. Results The review identified a total of 16 pediatric and 18 adult national/international surveys assessing SB, few of which have undergone psychometric testing. Fourteen pediatric and 35 adult questionnaires with psychometric information were included. While reliability was generally good to excellent for questions targeting <b>key</b> <b>modes</b> of SB, validity was poor to moderate, and reported much less frequently. The most valid and reliable questions targeting specific modes of SB were combined to create a single questionnaire targeting <b>key</b> <b>modes</b> of SB. Discussion Our results highlight the importance of including SB questions in survey modules that are adaptable, able to assess various modes of SB, and that exhibit adequate reliability and validity. Future research could investigate the psychometric properties of the module we have proposed in this paper, as well as other questionnaires currently used in national and international population health surveys...|$|R

Rapid Evolution is the only program which can detect advanced <b>key</b> <b>modes,</b> such as aeolian, ionian, dorian, phrygian, lydian and mixolydian.

50|$|Mode B is {{the second}} mode, which devolved from a logic error in an early iambic <b>keyer.</b> In <b>mode</b> B, dots and dashes are {{produced}} as long as both paddles are depressed. When the paddles are released, the keying continues by sending one more element, i.e., a dot if the paddles were released during a dash, or a dash if the paddles were released during a dot. Users accustomed to one mode usually {{find it difficult to}} use the other, so all competently designed keyers allow for selection of the desired <b>keyer</b> <b>mode.</b> If forced to use a keyer with an unaccustomed mode, the user must revert to single paddle mode in which both paddles are never depressed simultaneously.|$|R

40|$|Chords {{and keys}} {{are among the}} most {{exhaustive}} descriptors of songs. In this study we focus on chord and key sequence recognition from an audio signal, in the context of pop and rock music. The system exploits a set of novel probabilistic models that describe the relationship between different aspects of music and their temporal evolution. These models are based on a set of parameters with a musical meaning. The models include two diatonic <b>key</b> <b>modes,</b> Dorian and Mixolydian, besides major and minor modes previously considered in the literature. These four <b>key</b> <b>modes</b> are the most used in western pop and rock music. In order to provide a compact representation of the chord and key sequences, three novel time-varying harmony- based features are here introduced. Given the importance of emotion characterization in music, the three features are here related to the mood perceived in songs. The method outperforms the state-of-the-art in both chord and key recognition tasks. In order to better train our parameters, we create annotations of chords and keys for a new dataset of 62 songs from the first five Robbie Williams’ albums...|$|R
