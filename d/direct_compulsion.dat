On his final day of production, at a farewell party in his honor, Welles was informed by producer Richard Zanuck that the actor's entire paycheck had been garnished by the Internal Revenue Service.|$|E

40|$|The {{object of}} this study is to analyze the factors {{influencing}} success of Bank-issued micropayment systems in Iran. Based on an existing IS post acceptance model which considers well known factors, we focus on studying the influence of a new factor related to <b>compulsion</b> (<b>direct</b> and indirect). Our model consists of seven main factors along with ‘Direct compulsion’ defined as a mediator variable between “Satisfaction”, “Perceived Usefulness”, “Network Externalities” and “Continuance Intension”. 409 filled questionnaires were gathered and analyzed to check thirteen hypotheses related to our model. The collected data have been analyzed at three levels. First, some descriptive statistics are derived in order to obtain an overview of the characteristics of the sample. Second, bivariate correlations between variables are analyzed with respect to the correlation between scales of variables and mediator variables. The final stage of the analysis adopts a regression analysis in order to identify the eventual existence of association and relationship between the dependent and independent variables.

40|$|The regime {{created by}} Miranda v. Arizona {{is at this}} point in its history {{bankrupt}} both intellectually and in terms of practical effect. Justices who have joined the Court after Miranda have cut back its scope by stingy interpretations of the doctrine’s reach and effect. In practice, few suspects actually benefit from the way Miranda is now implemented in police stations and courtrooms. Given the failure of Miranda’s promise, can we envision an alternative? Here is one that may be politically palatable and doctrinally feasible, largely adopted from English practice: 1. Police would give the same Miranda warnings that they have always provided. 2. The police would still operate under the same rules governing the legitimacy of a suspect’s decision to talk {{in the absence of an}} attorney. The waiver rules for Miranda rights won’t change, in other words. 3. If the police go ahead and obtain a statement from a suspect without the presence of an attorney, the jury would be instructed that there is a policy in the jurisdiction that the police should not interrogate suspects in the absence of a defense attorney and that the jury may take into account in evaluating the credibility of the statement the fact that the police did not follow this policy. 4. If the police do provide an attorney for the suspect during interrogation, the suspect would be permitted to consult with the attorney and the attorney would be given a reasonable opportunity to advise the suspect during the interrogation. 5. If the suspect does not answer questions that are reasonable for someone in the suspect’s position at the time to respond to, that information would be admissible as substantive evidence of the suspect’s guilt, subject to a ruling on the probative value of the suspect’s silence at the time of trial. 6. If the suspect at trial maintains that his or her silence during the interrogation was based on the advice of the attorney, that claim shall constitute a waiver of the attorney client privilege insofar as it would otherwise protect the contents of the conversation between the suspect and the lawyer. This paper explores the feasibility of the most contestable of these proposals, the one dealing with an adverse inference from silence. It makes the case for viewing the privilege against self incrimination as a doctrine <b>directed</b> at prohibiting <b>compulsion</b> to speak rather than a broad guarantee of a right to silence...|$|R

5000|$|On August 27, Zbigniew Bujak, one of Solidarity {{leaders who}} had eluded arrest, {{published}} a statement, {{in which he}} urged the nation to participate in rallies and demonstrations on {{the second anniversary of}} the Gdańsk Agreement. Two days later, general Jaruzelski warned people to keep away from protests. On the next day, units of riot police armed with water cannons were deployed on the streets of Warsaw and main cities of the country. Citizens were warned that the government would not hesitate to use force. Polish news agency PAP issued a statement, which said: [...] "The martial law decree makes the forces of law and order absolutely responsible for ensuring public order.

40|$|State {{bodies have}} a right to resort to state {{compulsion}}, i. e. to a group of compulsion means which are an attribute of the state only. One of the most severe forms of state compulsion is <b>direct</b> <b>compulsion</b> which is applied predominantly by public officials {{in order to protect the}} rights and liberty of an individual and to ensure public safety. These means are designed to force a person to subordination to the commands based on law, which may entail the use of physical force.

40|$|This thesis explores two key themes: (1) the social, {{cultural}} and economic changes in the Roman provinces of Spain during {{the last half of}} the first century BC and the early first century AD, and the direct effect that Augustus had in driving these developments; (2) the significance that the provinces of Spain had for Augustus and Rome. Initially we assess the exploitation of the Cantabrian War for the military image of Augustus, suggesting that the conflict played a crucial role in bolstering the position of the princeps following the Civil Wars and the constitutional arrangements reached with the senate up to 27. From here in turn we consider the manner in which Augustan action within Iberia impacted upon the literary and visual depictions of the peninsula. The thesis also highlights the fiscal imperatives that acted as a driving force behind the growth in urbanisation, the widespread promotion of privileged status and the provincial reorganisations of Augustus. Following this, the surge in monumentalisation across Hispania’s towns and cities is treated, placing a renewed emphasis on the role of the Augustan regime in encouraging, if indirectly, these processes. An assessment of the impact of Augustan rule on the upward mobility of the Spanish elites follows, highlighting patronage and wealth as the twin pillars of Spanish advancement and suggesting that the first princeps is instrumental in laying the groundwork for the expanding promotion of Spaniards during the reigns of his immediate successors. Finally, the thesis concludes with an overview of the nascent imperial cult in Spain, suggesting in the first instance that the imposition of the cult in the north-west aided the suppression of the recalcitrant tribes and may very well have impacted upon Augustan policies in similarly unstable areas such as Germany and Gaul; and secondly, that whilst <b>direct</b> <b>compulsion</b> cannot be countenanced, Augustus’ dissemination of civic organisation created a framework within which elite competition ensured the rapid proliferation of the imperial cult throughout the towns and cities of Spain and the western provinces...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} binds {{together and}} draws conclusions from {{a research project}} concerning conditions surrounding {{the growth of a}} bureaucratic element in large (union) organisations. In order to promote a wider knowledge of these conditions, a study was made of the great constitutional reform which the Swedish Confederation of Trade Unions underwent in 1941. An attempt was made to find the main driving force behind that constitutional reform. The study was drawn up as a case-study. The method is primarily historical-sociological. The data is primarily drawn from official sources and from the organisations. The results of a number of empirical studies are summarized. On a concrete level, it is possible to trace the Confederation's great constitutional reform back to conflicts between the Government and organisations operating within the labour market during the economic crisis {{at the beginning of the}} 1930 's. The Government asserted its position in relation to the Labour organisations, and, as a last resort, threatened them with legislation. The putting through of the Saltsjöbaden Agreement between the Swedish Employers' Association and the Confederation of Trade Unions in 1938, with its subsequent changes towards authoritative centralisation in the Confederations 1 s constitution, took the place of the legislation in question. On a more general level, centralisation and a reduction in membership influence may be seen as the price to be paid for the Confederation's method of adjusting itself to the development needs of a capitalist economic system. Within the Confederation of Trade Unions, a conflict developed between, on the one hand, the demands of members and the task of functioning as an organ of union struggle, and on the other, the demands of economic politics. These two demands were not always in harmony. The result of the case-study may thus be seen to be generally applicable on the causal side, in the restrictions which a capitalist economy's development, and the conditions of stabilisation politics, tended to set upon union activity (regarding conflict tactics and wage-policies). On the effect side, the results of the case-study are not generally appi i-cable. From the Government's side, conceivable measures in the face of conflict may include <b>direct</b> <b>compulsion,</b> informal appeals, or total passivity. From the organisation's side, possible reactions may range from voluntary cooperation to open conflict and struggle against the state. The main Swedish union organisations have, except in rare instances, cooperated voluntarily - under the latent threat of state intervention. The price, from the Confederation's side, has included a reduction of membership influence concerning conflict tactics and wage-policies. At the organisational level, this development has probably worked along with pressure from the Swedish Employers's Association, advantages to be gained from large-scale operation, and the need to find ways to solve inner conflicts, concerning, among other things, the enactment of the solidarity wage-policy under the restrictions mentioned above. Even the "inner dynamic" in large organisations, as identified by Robert Michels, has probably contributed to the total result. digitalisering@um...|$|E
