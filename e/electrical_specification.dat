40|$|Abstract—This paper {{focuses on}} finding the key <b>electrical</b> <b>specifications</b> for a multi-standard radio {{receiver}} {{compatible with the}} major commercial wireless standards. By developing a standard independent methodology, the paper addresses systematically {{the large amount of}} information comprised in the envisaged standards. Based on the systematic approach, the multi-standard receiver main electrical requirements are defined and their values determined.

50|$|Socket 7 is a {{physical}} and <b>electrical</b> <b>specification</b> for an x86-style CPU socket on a personal computer motherboard. It was released June 1995. The socket supersedes the earlier Socket 5, and accepts P5 Pentium microprocessors manufactured by Intel, as well as compatibles made by Cyrix/IBM, AMD, IDT and others.|$|E
50|$|The {{interface}} {{has spawned}} a generation of flash memory cards that set out to improve on the size and features of Type I cards: CompactFlash, MiniCard, P2 Card and SmartMedia. For example, the PC Card <b>electrical</b> <b>specification</b> is also used for CompactFlash, so a PC Card CompactFlash adapter need only be a socket adapter.|$|E
50|$|As the <b>electrical</b> <b>specification</b> {{currently}} only {{defines a}} purpose {{for a single}} wire pair, some equipment manufacturers continue to use it. Such equipment is not compliant with the DMX standard, but may be sufficiently compatible for operation using simple adapters.Note: There is a risk of equipment damage if 3-pin XLR audio and DMX signals are plugged into each other.|$|E

50|$|HDMI is a newer digital audio/video {{interface}} {{developed and}} {{promoted by the}} consumer electronics industry. DVI and HDMI have the same <b>electrical</b> <b>specifications</b> for their TMDS and VESA/DDC links. However HDMI and DVI differ in several key ways.|$|R
50|$|The E1.11 (DMX512 2004) <b>electrical</b> <b>specification</b> {{addresses}} {{the connection of}} DMX512 signal common to Earth ground. Specifically, the standard recommends that transmitter ports (DMX512 controller OUT port) have a low impedance connection between signal common and ground; such ports {{are referred to as}} grounded. It is further recommended that receivers have a high impedance connection between signal common and ground; such ports are referred to as isolated.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>electrical</b> <b>specification</b> {{might call}} for a {{resistor}} with a nominal value of 100 Ω (ohms), but will also state a tolerance such as [...] "±1%". This means that any resistor with a value in the range 99 Ω to 101 Ω is acceptable. For critical components, one might specify that the actual resistance must remain within tolerance within a specified temperature range, over a specified lifetime, and so on.|$|E
50|$|DMX512 is a {{bus network}} {{no more than}} 1200 m long, with not more than 32 unit loads on a single bus. If more than 32 unit loads need to communicate, the network can be {{expanded}} across parallel buses using DMX splitters. Network wiring consists of a shielded twisted pair, with a characteristic impedance of 120 Ohms, with a termination resistor {{at the end of}} the cable furthest from the controller to absorb signal reflections. DMX512 has two twisted pair data paths, although specification currently only defines the use of one of the twisted pairs. The second pair is undefined, but required by the <b>electrical</b> <b>specification.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Nuclear Instrumentation Module (NIM) {{standard}} defines {{mechanical and}} <b>electrical</b> <b>specifications</b> for electronics modules used in experimental particle and nuclear physics.

50|$|There is {{a second}} viewpoint: that of the {{telephone}} industry, where ISDN is a core technology. A telephone network {{can be thought of}} as a collection of wires strung between switching systems. The common <b>electrical</b> <b>specification</b> for the signals on these wires is T1 or E1. Between telephone company switches, the signaling is performed via SS7. Normally, a PBX is connected via a T1 with robbed bit signaling to indicate on-hook or off-hook conditions and MF and DTMF tones to encode the destination number. ISDN is much better because messages can be sent much more quickly than by trying to encode numbers as long (100 ms per digit) tone sequences. This results in faster call setup times. Also, a greater number of features are available and fraud is reduced.|$|E

40|$|There are {{virtually}} no electronic products today that can {{comply with the}} conducted emission regulatory requirements {{without the use of}} some form of power supply filter being inserted where the power cord exits the product. Sometimes, properly designed transformers can provide inherent filtering, and so can obviate the need for an intentional filter. Mains EMI (electromagnetic interference) filters carry potentially high currents at dangerously high voltages, so care is essential in their choice. The working voltage and current rating of components can be decided once the specification is known. The basic specification should also include mechanical details such as the enclosure size, and the limit of weight. The <b>electrical</b> <b>specification</b> should include the voltage and current rating. In addition the EMC performance and the allowable leakage current should be specified. The <b>electrical</b> <b>specification</b> must also comply with national safety standards.
