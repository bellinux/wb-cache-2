40|$|Background: 4 -hydroxy- 2 -oxoglutarate (HOG) {{aldolase}} is {{a unique}} enzyme in the hydroxyproline degradation pathway catalyzing the cleavage of HOG to pyruvate and glyoxylate. Mutations in this enzyme {{are believed to be}} associated with the excessive production of oxalate in primary hyperoxaluria type 3 (PH 3), although no experimental data is available to support this hypothesis. Moreover, the identity, oligomeric state, enzymatic activity, and crystal structure of human HOGA have not been experimentally determined. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study human HOGA (hHOGA) was identified by mass spectrometry of the mitochondrial enzyme purified from bovine kidney. hHOGA performs a retro-aldol cleavage reaction reminiscent of the trimeric 2 -keto- 3 -deoxy- 6 -phosphogluconate aldolases. Sequence comparisons, however, show that HOGA is related to the tetrameric, bacterial <b>dihydrodipicolinate</b> <b>synthases,</b> but the reaction direction is reversed. The 1. 97 A ˚ resolution crystal structure of hHOGA bound to pyruvate was determined and enabled the modeling of the HOG-Schiff base intermediate and the identification of active site residues. Kinetic analyses of site-directed mutants support the importance of Lys 196 as the nucleophile, Tyr 168 and Ser 77 as components of a proton relay, and Asn 78 and Ser 198 as unique residues that facilitate substrate binding.

50|$|In {{molecular}} biology, {{the amino}} acid kinase domain is a protein domain. It {{is found in}} protein kinases with various specificities, including the aspartate, glutamate and uridylate kinase families. In prokaryotes and plants the synthesis of the essential amino acids lysine and threonine is predominantly regulated by feed-back inhibition of aspartate kinase (AK) and <b>dihydrodipicolinate</b> <b>synthase</b> (DHPS). In Escherichia coli, thrA, metLM, and lysC encode aspartokinase isozymes that show feedback inhibition by threonine, methionine, and lysine, respectively. The lysine-sensitive isoenzyme of aspartate kinase from spinach leaves has a subunit composition of 4 large and 4 small subunits.|$|E
50|$|Lysine is {{synthesized}} from aspartate via the diaminopimelate (DAP) pathway. The initial {{two stages}} of the DAP pathway are catalyzed by aspartokinase and aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase and {{play a key role}} in the biosynthesis of lysine, threonine and methionine. There are two bifunctional aspartokinase/homoserine dehydrogenases, ThrA and MetL, in addition to a monofunctional aspartokinase, LysC. Transcription of aspartokinase genes is regulated by concentrations of the subsequently produced amino acids, lysine, threonine and methionine. The higher these amino acids concentrations, the less the gene is transcribed. ThrA and LysC are also feed-back inhibited by threonine and lysine. Finally, DAP decarboxylase LysA mediates the last step of the lysine synthesis and is common for all studied bacterial species. The formation of aspartate kinase (AK), which catalyzes the phosphorylation of aspartate and initiates its conversion into other amino acids, is also inhibited by both lysine and threonine, which prevents the formation of the amino acids derived from aspartate. Additionally, high lysine concentrations inhibit the activity of <b>dihydrodipicolinate</b> <b>synthase</b> (DHPS). So, in addition to inhibiting the first enzyme of the aspartate families biosynthetic pathway, lysine also inhibits the activity of the first enzyme after the branch point, i.e. the enzyme that is specific for lysine’s own synthesis.|$|E

40|$|<b>Dihydrodipicolinate</b> <b>synthase</b> (EC 4. 2. 1. 52), {{the first}} enzyme unique to lysine {{biosynthesis}} in bacteria and higher plants, has been purified to homogeneity from etiolated pea (Pisum sativum) seedlings {{using a combination}} of conventional and affinity chromatographic steps. This is the first report on a homogeneous preparation of native <b>dihydrodipicolinate</b> <b>synthase</b> from a plant source. The pea <b>dihydrodipicolinate</b> <b>synthase</b> has an apparent molecular weight of 127, 000 and is composed of three identical subunits of 43, 000 as determined by gel filtration and cross-linking experiments. The trimeric quaternary structure resembles the trimeric structure of other aldolases, such as 2 -keto- 3 -deoxy- 6 -phosphogluconic acid aldolase, which catalyze similar aldol condensations. The amino acid compositions of <b>dihydrodipicolinate</b> <b>synthase</b> from pea and Escherichia coli are similar, the most significant difference concerns the methionine content: <b>dihydrodipicolinate</b> <b>synthase</b> from pea contains 22 moles of methionine residue per mole of native protein, contrary to the E. coli enzyme, which does not contain this amino acid at all. <b>Dihydrodipicolinate</b> <b>synthase</b> from pea is highly specific for the substrates pyruvate and l-aspartate-β-semialdehyde; it follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics for both substrates. The pyruvate and l-aspartate-β-semialdehyde have Michaelis constant values of 1. 70 and 0. 40 millimolar, respectively. l-Lysine, S-(2 -aminoethyl) -l-cysteine, and l-α-(2 -aminoethoxyvinyl) glycine are strong allosteric inhibitors of the enzyme with 50 % inhibitory values of 20, 160, and 155 millimolar, respectively. The inhibition by l-lysine and l-α-(2 -aminoethoxyvinyl) glycine is noncompetitive towards l-aspartate-β-semialdehyde, whereas S-(2 -aminoethyl) -l-cysteine inhibits <b>dihydrodipicolinate</b> <b>synthase</b> competitively with respect to l-aspartate-β-semialdehyde. Furthermore, the addition of (2 R, 3 S, 6 S) - 2, 6 -diamino- 3 -hydroxy-heptandioic acid (1. 2 millimolar) and (2 S, 6 R/S) - 2, 6 -diamino- 6 -phosphono-hexanic acid (1. 2 millimolar) activates <b>dihydrodipicolinate</b> <b>synthase</b> from pea by a factor of 1. 4 and 1. 2, respectively.

In addition to aspartate kinase activity, the synthesis of diaminopimelate decarboxylase was also found to be regulated. The specific activity of this enzyme was reduced to one-third in extracts of cells grown {{in the presence of}} lysine. Aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase, <b>dihydrodipicolinate</b> <b>synthase,</b> dihydrodipicolinate reductase, and diaminopimelate dehydrogenase were neither influenced in their specific activity, nor inhibited, by any of the aspartate family of amino acids. Homoserine dehydrogenase was repressed by methionine (to 15 % of its original activity) and inhibited by thremine (4 % remaining activity). Inclusion of leucine in the growth medium resulted in a twofold increase of homoserine dehydrogenase specific activity.

Study of the inhibition properties of <b>dihydrodipicolinate</b> <b>synthase</b> and aspartate kinase activities in RAEC- 1 × RLT 70 confirmed the heterozygote state of both mutations, because only half of their lysine-sensitive activity could still be inhibited by this negative effector.

An abnormal phenotype was clearly associated with such high levels of lysine accumulation, which points out the possible role of this amino acid in the developmental features of the plant.

Insight into enzyme mechanism and inhibition may ultimately prove useful in herbicide or insecticide development, as other dihydrodipicolinate synthases from harmful fungi, bacteria, or plants, make attractive targets for inhibition.

High-level expression of the two bacterial enzymes resulted in only {{a slight increase in}} free lysine accumulation at intermediate stages of seed development, while free lysine declined to the low level of control plants toward maturity. To test whether enhanced catabolism {{may have contributed to the}} failure of free lysine to accumulate in seeds of transgenic plants, we analyzed the activity of lysine-ketoglutarate reductase (EC 1. 5. 1. 7), an enzyme that catabolizes lysine into saccharopine. In both the control and the transgenic plants, the timing of appearance of lysine-ketoglutarate reductase activity correlated very closely with that of <b>dihydrodipicolinate</b> <b>synthase</b> activity, suggesting that lysine synthesis and catabolism were coordinately regulated during seed development.

Secondary mutations restoring growth to a ridA mutant in the presence of serine were in dapA (encoding <b>dihydrodipicolinate</b> <b>synthase)</b> and thrA (encoding homoserine dehydrogenase). These mutations suppressed multiple ridA mutant phenotypes by increasing the synthesis of threonine. The ability of threonine to suppress the metabolic defects of a ridA mutant is discussed in the context of recent biochemical data and in vivo results presented here...|$|E
40|$|The aspartate-derived {{amino acid}} pathway in plants {{leads to the}} {{biosynthesis}} of lysine, methionine, threonine, and isoleucine. These four amino acids are essential in the diets of humans and other animals, but are present in growth-limiting quantities {{in some of the}} world's major food crops. Genetic and biochemical approaches have been used for the functional analysis of almost all Arabidopsis thaliana enzymes involved in aspartate-derived amino acid biosynthesis. The branch-point enzymes aspartate kinase, <b>dihydrodipicolinate</b> <b>synthase,</b> homoserine dehydrogenase, cystathionine gamma synthase, threonine synthase, and threonine deaminase contain well-studied sites for allosteric regulation by pathway products and other plant metabolites. In contrast, relatively {{little is known about the}} transcriptional regulation of amino acid biosynthesis and the mechanisms that are used to balance aspartate-derived amino acid biosynthesis with other plant metabolic needs. The aspartate-derived amino acid pathway provides excellent examples of basic research conducted with A. thaliana that has been used to improve the nutritional quality of crop plants, in particular to increase the accumulation of lysine in maize and methionine in potatoes...|$|E
40|$|Reliance of biotrophic {{pathogens}} {{on living}} plant tissues to propagate implies strong interdependence between host metabolism and nutrient uptake by the pathogen. However, factors determining host suitability and establishment of infection are largely unknown. We describe a loss-of-inhibition allele of ASPARTATE KINASE 2 and a loss-of-function allele of <b>DIHYDRODIPICOLINATE</b> <b>SYNTHASE</b> 2 identified in a screen for Arabidopsis thaliana mutants with increased {{resistance to the}} obligate biotrophic oomycete Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis (Hpa). Through different molecular mechanisms, these mutations perturb amino acid homeostasis leading to overaccumulation of the Asp-derived amino acids Met, Thr, and Ile. Although detrimental for the plant, the mutations do not cause defense activation, and both mutants retain full susceptibility to the adapted obligate biotrophic fungus Golovinomyces orontii (Go). Chemical treatments mimicking the mutants' metabolic state identified Thr as the amino acid suppressing Hpa but not Go colonization. We conclude that perturbations in amino acid homeostasis render the mutant plants unsuitable as an infection substrate for Hpa. This {{may be explained by}} deployment of the same amino acid biosynthetic pathways by oomycetes and plants. Our data show that the plant host metabolic state can, in specific ways, influence the ability of adapted biotrophic strains to cause disease...|$|E
