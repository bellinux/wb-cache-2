5|$|Communications usually {{consisted}} of FuG X, the later FuG 10 (Funkgerät), navigational <b>direction</b> <b>finder</b> PeilG V <b>direction</b> <b>finder</b> (PeilG - Peilgerät) and the FuG 25 IFF and FuBI 1 blind-landing devices. The crew communicated by EiV intercom. A primitive autopilot device, the Siemens K4Ü, was installed and could maintain bearing using the rudder's control surfaces.|$|E
5|$|A {{hand-held}} radio <b>direction</b> <b>finder,</b> {{most commonly}} the L-Tronics Little L-Per, {{is used by}} ground teams to search for downed aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Most ships {{had their}} director-control tower and {{rangefinder}} above the bridge removed {{in exchange for}} a Type 271 target-indication radar. A Type 286 short-range surface search radar, adapted from the Royal Air Force's ASV radar, was also added. The early models, however, could only scan directly forward and had to be aimed by turning the entire ship. Some ships also received a Huff-Duff radio <b>direction</b> <b>finder</b> on a short mainmast.|$|E

40|$|A three-station {{network is}} {{described}} which senses magnetic and electric fields of lightning. Directional and distance information {{derived from the}} data are used to redundantly determine lightning position. This redundancy is used to correct consistent propagation errors. A comparison is made of the relative accuracy of VLF <b>direction</b> <b>finders</b> with a newer method to determine distance to and location of lightning by the ratio of magnetic-to-electric field as observed at 400 Hz. It was found that VLF <b>direction</b> <b>finders</b> can determine lightning positions with only one-half {{the accuracy of the}} method that uses the ratio of magnetic-to-electric field...|$|R

5|$|Finder No. 3, Mark IV, for the Army, but the Army {{cancelled}} {{the order}} in August 1941 when the prototype was nearly complete. In January 1942, he was seconded to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research's Radiophysics Laboratory in Sydney to develop secret valves for a Radio <b>Direction</b> <b>Finder.</b> He teamed up with Eric Burhop to build a magnetron, producing a working prototype on 23 May 1942. He {{then went on to}} build an original magnetron that generated 25centimetre microwave radiation. These magnetrons were used in radar equipment by the Army, RAAF, Royal Australian Navy (RAN), and United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). Wishing to return to Melbourne, he stepped down as Deputy Chief of the Division of Radiophysics in January 1944, and took charge of the Valve Laboratory at the University of Melbourne.|$|E
5|$|The P variant {{had similar}} {{features}} to the Do 17M-1, with added blind flying and camera equipment for reconnaissance work. The Do 17P-1 was powered by two BMW 132N radial engines {{with a maximum}} performance of 865PS (853hp, 636kW) each. The machine was fitted with several radio variations. The FuG IIIaU radio (Funkgerät), the PeilG V <b>direction</b> <b>finder</b> (PeilG - Peilgerät) and the FuBI 1 radio blind-landing device (FuBI - Funkblindlandegerät). The crew of three communicated with each other via the EiV intercom (EiV -Eigenverständigungsanlage). The P-1 was equipped with either Rb 20/30 and Rb 50/30 or Rb 20/18 and Rb 50/18 cameras. The P-1/trop was fitted with filters and protection for the cameras. The cameras were controlled remotely by the crew from the cockpit.|$|E
25|$|A Bellini–Tosi <b>{{direction}}</b> <b>finder</b> (B–T or BTDF) {{is a type}} {{of radio}} <b>direction</b> <b>finder</b> (RDF), which determines the direction to, or bearing of, a radio transmitter. Earlier RDF systems used very large rotating loop antennae, which the B–T system replaced with two fixed antennae and a small rotating loop, known as a radiogoniometer. This made RDF much more practical, especially on large vehicles like ships or when using very long wavelengths that demand large antennae.|$|E
50|$|In 1931, Lear {{bought his}} first aircraft, a Fleet biplane for $2,500 {{from a woman}} in Dearborn, Michigan. The {{challenges}} of aerial navigation led Lear into the development of radio <b>direction</b> <b>finders</b> and avionics products.|$|R
50|$|W 34 hi: 485 kW BMW 132A/E, the {{aircraft}} could take six passengers and {{was equipped with}} improved radio- and <b>direction</b> <b>finders.</b> This version was mostly used by Luftwaffe to train pilots and radio operators.|$|R
50|$|Lear founded Lear Developments, {{a company}} specializing in {{aerospace}} instruments and electronics. Lear developed radio <b>direction</b> <b>finders,</b> autopilots, {{and the first}} fully automatic aircraft landing system. He was awarded the Collier Trophy for this contribution in 1949.|$|R
25|$|The {{navigator}} on the Lady Be Good {{thought he}} was flying on a direct path from Naples to Benghazi. But the base's radio <b>direction</b> <b>finder</b> only had a single loop antenna. As the plane's <b>direction</b> <b>finder</b> could not distinguish between a signal in front or behind the aircraft, {{there was no way}} to identify reciprocal readings. The same bearing would be returned whether the plane was heading inbound from the Mediterranean or outbound inland.|$|E
25|$|The {{ship was}} {{designed}} with a bulletproof navigation bridge, and {{is equipped with}} fire monitors, night vision capability, a work boat, and radio <b>direction</b> <b>finder</b> capability.|$|E

25|$|Sea Devil {{remained}} on life guard {{duty in the}} northern Ryukyu Islands and southern Kyūshū area until 10July, then headed east to Guam for refit and the installation of LORAN equipment and a radio <b>direction</b> <b>finder.</b> On 9August, she {{headed back to the}} Yellow Sea. On 14August, she transited the Nansei Shoto, passing south of Akuseki Shima; and, on 15August, after entering her patrol area, she received word of Japan's acceptance of Allied surrender terms.|$|E
50|$|Non-directional beacons {{transmit}} continuously for {{the benefit}} of radio <b>direction</b> <b>finders</b> in marine and aeronautical navigation. They identify themselves by a callsign in Morse code. They can occupy any frequency in the range 190-1750 kHz. In North America, they occupy 190-535 kHz. In ITU Region 1 the lower limit is 280 kHz.|$|R
5000|$|In late October 1943, TG 21.14 {{went out}} for a fourth patrol, searching for a {{reported}} refueling concentration of U-boats around a Milchkuhe (Milk Cow) tanker sub in the North Atlantic.

50|$|Due to the disproportionately large GSM {{mobile phone}} {{subscriber}} base in Nigeria {{and the use}} of cellphones as the principal means of communication by kidnappers and terrorists, the agency has had to develop telephone call intercept capability. IMSI number catchers and signal <b>direction</b> <b>finders</b> have been deployed for intercepting and tracking GSM and satellite phone communications.|$|R
25|$|The {{introduction}} of transistorized radios, and then microcontroller-based systems that decoded the location directly, continued to improve Loran-A systems while prices dropped. By the early 1970s such units were relatively common, although they remained relatively expensive compared to devices like a radio <b>direction</b> <b>finder.</b> But {{the improvement of}} electronics through this period was so rapid {{that it was only}} a few years before Loran-C units of similar size and cost were available. This led to the decision to open Loran-C to civilian use in 1974.|$|E
25|$|B–T, and {{rotating}} {{loops of}} various sorts, {{continued to be}} used in the post-war era by civilians. Improvements continued to be made to both systems throughout this period, especially the introduction of solenoids in place of conventional loops in some roles. However, the introduction of the doppler <b>direction</b> <b>finder,</b> and especially the low-cost electronics to implement it, led to the disappearance of the traditional loop systems by the mid-1990s. Doppler systems use fixed antennae, like BTDF, but handle the direction finding purely in signal processing.|$|E
25|$|Shifting to Port Covington, Baltimore, on 16 April 1944, {{to take on}} {{supplies}} and fuel, Zeus reported to Commander Amphibious Training, Atlantic Fleet, on 23 April, for shakedown. She sailed for the Naval Operating Base (NOB), Norfolk, on 24 April, and calibrated her radio <b>direction</b> <b>finder</b> en route. After taking on ammunition and supplies at NOB Norfolk (26 April), the ship departed at Lambert's Point, Norfolk, the following day (27 April), then began her shakedown on 28 April, conducting an eight-hour full power run on 29 April.|$|E
50|$|RU-6A Beaver {{aircraft}} {{equipped with}} airborne radio <b>direction</b> <b>finders</b> (ARDF) {{were the first}} Army reconnaissance aircraft in South Vietnam, arriving in March 1962 and assigned to the Flight Detachment of the 3rd Radio Research Unit.
