I must say that I am very dissatisfied with the situation, because this so-called 'good theory' does involve neglecting infinities which appear in its equations, neglecting them in an arbitrary way. This is just not sensible mathematics. Sensible mathematics involves neglecting a quantity when it is small - not neglecting it just because it is infinitely great and you do not want it! ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{laboratory}} in ME 152 {{is to be able}} to apply topics learned in the lecture section of the course as well as ME 151 in a CAD environment. The purpose of ME 153 is to expand on the skills learned in ME 152. This course goal is not to teach the program, but to present enough of it so that the student can present well documented engineering drawings which utilize proper views and dimensions. The CAD platform, SolidWorks, is the program which will be utilized to this end. Warning: Do not use shortcuts! Whenever learning a new platform strict adherence to proper protocols and procedures is essential for establishing a firm foundation of good habits. This also eases a transition to any other CAD platform. Types of files: In SolidWorks there are several types of files used. The most common is the Part File which has an extension SLDPRT. (SolidWorks automatically appends the extension so you do not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.)</b> This type of file is where all the components are constructed. Each part must be one contiguous piece and there may be only one component in each part file. In advanced workings, there may be several different configurations of a part in a file, but it is still essentially one part in the file...|$|E
