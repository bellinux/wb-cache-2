25|$|On May 2009, President Barack Obama {{signed a}} Presidential Directive {{with the aim}} to advance {{biofuels}} research and improve their commercialization.

25|$|<b>Flexible</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>vehicles</b> are {{designed}} to operate smoothly using {{a wide range of}} available ethanol fuel mixtures—from pure gasoline to bioethanol-gasoline blends such as E85 (85% ethanol and 15% gasoline) or E100 (neat hydrous ethanol) in Brazil. Part of the challenge of successful marketing alternative and <b>flexible</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>vehicles</b> in the U.S. is the general lack of establishment of sufficient fueling stations, which would be essential for these vehicles to be attractive {{to a wide range of}} consumers. Significant efforts to ramp up production and distribution of E85 fuels are underway and expanding. Current Ford E100 Flex sold in the Brazilian market are the Courier, Ford EcoSport, Ford Fiesta, Ford Focus, and Ford Ka.|$|R
25|$|Ford has {{expanded}} its lineup of flexible-fuel <b>vehicles,</b> alternative <b>fuel</b> <b>vehicles,</b> and dual-fuel <b>vehicles.</b> <b>Flexible</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>vehicles</b> can operate {{on a range of}} fuel mixtures – such as ethanol-gasoline blends ranging from pure gasoline to E85 (85% ethanol, 15% gasoline). Alternative <b>fuel</b> <b>vehicles</b> operate on non-petroleum fuels, such as methanol, compressed natural gas (CNG), propane, and hydrogen. Dual <b>fuel</b> <b>vehicles</b> generally have two fuel tanks – one for compressed natural gas or propane, and another for regular gasoline – with a selector switch to choose between them. <b>Vehicles</b> using these <b>fueling</b> alternatives are currently in test fleets, for example as taxis and shuttle buses, and some are or will soon be available for sale to the public. Ford is now committed to sell 250,000 alternative and <b>flexible</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>vehicles</b> – the majority of which will be designed to operate on ethanol-gasoline blends such as E85 – in 2006.|$|R
2500|$|The first {{commercial}} <b>flexible</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>vehicle</b> was the Ford Model T, produced from 1908 through 1927. It was {{fitted with a}} carburetor with adjustable jetting, allowing use of gasoline or ethanol, {{or a combination of}} both. Other car manufactures also provided engines for ethanol fuel use. [...] Ethanol was disadvantaged by frequent accusations that ethanol producers collaborated with bootleggers during Prohibition. Oil dominance as a motor fuel was questioned in the U.S. only after the 1973 oil crisis, which resulted in gasoline shortages and awareness on the dangers of oil dependence. This crisis opened a new opportunity for ethanol, methanol and other alternative fuels.|$|E
2500|$|The 2003 VW Gol 1.6 Total Flex was {{the first}} full flexible-fuel vehicle {{launched}} in Brazil, capable of running on any blend of gasoline and E100.

After the neat ethanol fiasco, consumer confidence in ethanol-powered vehicles was restored, allowing a rapid adoption of the flex technology. This was facilitated by the fuel distribution infrastructure already in place throughout Brazil, with more than 30 thousand fueling stations, a heritage of the Pró-Álcool program ...|$|E

30|$|As a {{consequence}} of OPEC- Arab oil crisis of the 70 ’s, Brazil created in 1975 the National Ethanol Program (PROALCOOL) (Solomon et al. 2007).
