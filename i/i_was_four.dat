When Villa was four, his chances of becoming a footballer were put in jeopardy when he suffered a fracture to the femur in his right leg, but he made a complete recovery. Due to the injury, {{he and his father}} worked on strengthening his left leg and Villa ultimately became ambidextrous. He recalls his father being consistently supportive: [...] "He would be there throwing me the ball over and over, making me kick it with my left leg when my right was in plaster after breaking it, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>four.</b> I can barely remember a single training session when my dad wasn't there. I have never been alone on a football pitch." ...|$|E
500|$|McKellen {{was born}} on 25 May 1939 in Burnley, Lancashire, the son of Margery Lois (née Sutcliffe) and Denis Murray McKellen, a civil engineer. He was their second child, with a sister, Jean, five years his senior. Shortly before the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in September 1939, his family moved to Wigan. They lived there until Ian was twelve years old, before relocating to Bolton in 1951, after his father had been promoted. The experience of living through the war as a young child had a lasting impact on him, and he later said that [...] "only after peace resumed ... did I realise that war wasn't normal." [...] When an interviewer remarked that he seemed quite calm in the aftermath of 11 September attacks, McKellen said: [...] "Well, darling, you forget—I slept under a steel plate until <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>four</b> years old." [...] Even though he only lived in Bolton for less than seven years, as opposed to the eleven years [...] in Wigan beforehand, he refers to Bolton as his [...] "Hometown".|$|E

The secondary data are script of the movie and internet websites related to the study. The method of collecting data is purpose sampling by watching carefully the movie and then the researcher tooksample dialogue and picture of the movie then used them as a starting point to analyze the issue. The technique of data analysis is descriptive technique. The result of the analysis shows the following conclusion: first, John Smith chooses to get better life without moving, running, and hiding again. He becomes more optimistic and independent for his life. Second, John Smith chooses to surpass his problem through his action. He has the courage to fight the Mogadorians enemy.
