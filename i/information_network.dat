5|$|The UK Albums Chart is {{a weekly}} record chart based on album sales from Sunday to Saturday in the United Kingdom; during the 1990s, {{a total of}} 216 albums reached number one. Until 1 February 1994, the chart was {{compiled}} each week by Gallup– after this date, it was managed by Millward Brown, who expanded the number of sales figures sampled, and extended the use of electronic point of sale machines. From July 1998 onwards, compilation of the chart was overseen by the Chart <b>Information</b> <b>Network,</b> jointly operated by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) and the British Association of Record Dealers. Throughout the decade, the chart was based solely on physical album sales, and each week's number one was first announced on Sunday evenings on The Radio 1 Chart Show.|$|E

40|$|Social and {{technical}} information systems usually {{consist of a}} large number of interacting physical, conceptual, and human/societal entities. Such individual entities are intercon-nected to form large and sophisticated networks, which, without loss of generality, are often refereed to as <b>information</b> <b>networks.</b> Examples of <b>information</b> <b>networks</b> include the Web, highway or urban transportation networks, research collaboration and publication networks, biological networks and social <b>networks.</b> Clearly, <b>information</b> <b>networks</b> are ubiquitous and form a critical component of modern information infrastructure. Theoretically, <b>information</b> <b>networks</b> can be modeled and manipulated as large scale graphs, which have gradually become the first-class citizens in the data management and mining fields.

40|$|Most {{objects and}} {{data in the}} real world are interconnected, forming complex, {{heterogeneous}} but often semi-structured <b>information</b> <b>networks.</b> However, most people consider a database merely as a data repository that supports data storage and retrieval rather than one or a set of heterogeneous <b>information</b> <b>networks</b> that contain rich, inter-related, multi-typed data and <b>information.</b> Most <b>network</b> science researchers only study homogeneous networks, without distinguishing the different types of objects and links in the networks. In this tutorial, we view database and other interconnected data as heterogeneous <b>information</b> <b>networks,</b> and study how to leverage the rich semantic meaning of types of objects and links in the networks.

5|$|Beginning in the 1960s, {{scientists}} with the U.S. Public Health Service published reports about radioactivity released from Hanford, {{and there were}} protests from the health departments of Oregon and Washington. In response to {{an article in the}} Spokane Spokesman Review in September 1985, the Department of Energy announced to declassify environmental records and, in February 1986, released 19,000pages of previously unavailable historical documents about Hanford's operations. The Washington State Department of Health collaborated with the citizen-led Hanford Health <b>Information</b> <b>Network</b> (HHIN) to publicize data about the health effects of Hanford's operations. HHIN reports concluded that residents who lived downwind from Hanford or who used the Columbia River downstream were exposed to elevated doses of radiation that placed them at increased risk for various cancers and other diseases. A mass tort lawsuit brought by two thousand Hanford downwinders against the federal government has been in the court system for many years. Two of six plaintiffs who went to trial in 2005 were awarded $500,000 in damages.|$|E

In this paper, we will explore how the combination of OLAP analysis (Online Analytical Processing) and <b>information</b> <b>networks</b> could be an interesting issue. In Business Intelligence, OLAP is a technology supported by data warehousing systems. It provides tools for analyzing data according to multiple dimensions and multiple hierarchical levels. At the same time, several <b>information</b> <b>networks</b> (co-authors network, citations network, institutions network, etc.) can be built based on bibliographic databases. Originally, OLAP was introduced to analyze structured data. However, in this paper, we wonder if, by combining OLAP and <b>information</b> <b>networks,</b> we can provide {{a new way of}} analyzing bibliographic data. OLAP should be able to handle <b>information</b> <b>networks</b> and be also useful for monitoring, browsing and analyzing the content and the structure of bibliographic networks. The goal of this survey paper is to review previous work on OLAP and <b>information</b> <b>networks</b> dealing with bibliographic data. We also propose a comparison between traditional OLAP and OLAP on <b>information</b> <b>networks</b> and discuss the challenges OLAP faces regarding bibliographic networks...|$|R

40|$|With {{the recent}} {{advances}} in <b>information</b> <b>networks,</b> the problem of community detection has attracted much attention in the last decade. While network community detection has been ubiquitous, the task of collecting complete network data remains challenging in many real-world applications. Usually the collected network is incomplete {{with most of the}} edges missing. Commonly, in such networks, all nodes with attributes are available while only the edges within a few local regions of the network can be observed. In this paper, we study the problem of detecting communities in incomplete <b>information</b> <b>networks</b> with missing edges. We first learn a distance metric to reproduce the link-based distance between nodes from the observed edges in the local information regions. We then use the learned distance metric to estimate the distance between any pair of nodes in the network. A hierarchical clustering approach is proposed to detect communities within the incomplete <b>information</b> <b>networks.</b> Empirical studies on real-world <b>information</b> <b>networks</b> demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively detect community structures within incomplete <b>information</b> <b>networks...</b>|$|R
