25|$|David Renwick {{wanted to}} write a detective series that dealt with the actual work of {{detection}} rather than action, which most crime dramas appeared to focus on at the time. Also, whereas most of these were about who did it (Inspector Morse or Taggart) and why it was done (Cracker), this new series would be about <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>done,</b> with such tropes as murders committed in locked rooms, a person being in two places at once or impossible thefts. Finding a culprit would still be part of the detective's job, but the emphasis would be on discovering how the crime was committed.|$|E

25|$|Not {{only did}} the infamous game-losing play make {{kneeling}} acceptable, {{but most of the}} teams using it changed <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>done.</b> Prior to Pisarcik's fumble, teams had employed standard offensive formations such as an I or a split backfield. The Eagles' unlikely touchdown, however, had made the weakness of doing so glaring. Even though Pisarcik had been trying to hand off instead of kneeling, when he fumbled the snap, there was not only no offensive player there to try to recover it, no one was in position to tackle Edwards and prevent the touchdown either.|$|E

The whole thing is about passing it on, because that's <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> for me when I was learning from all those old blues and rockabilly records.

In addition {{to developing a}} separate mystery for each episode, the writers also had to provide clues {{that would lead to}} the murder's resolution in the season finale. The murder mystery plot was planned {{from the beginning of the}} season and the killer's identity remained the same throughout production. Thomas said that at the beginning of the season, [...] "I know the broad strokes, I know who did it, I know <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>done,</b> I know the big arcs, but we're always filling in the details. Those are week to week. It's a week to week challenge in the writers room figuring out how much information we want to dole out to the audience." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} {{moved to}} the United Kingdom and shot in a converted airship hangar in Cardington, Bedfordshire, north of London. There, the hotel bar set which tilted 30 degrees was built. A hotel corridor was also constructed by Guy Hendrix Dyas, the production designer, Chris Corbould, the special effects supervisor, and Wally Pfister, the director of photography; it rotated a full 360degrees to create the effect of alternate directions of gravity for scenes set during the second level of dreaming, where dream-sector physics become chaotic. The idea {{was inspired by a}} technique used in Stanley Kubrick's [...] (1968). Nolan said, [...] "I was interested in taking those ideas, techniques, and philosophies and applying them to an action scenario". The filmmakers originally planned to make the hallway only 40ft (12m) long, but as the action sequence became more elaborate, the hallway's length grew to 100ft (30m). The corridor was suspended along eight large concentric rings that were spaced equidistantly outside its walls and powered by two massive electric motors. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who plays Arthur, spent several weeks learning to fight in a corridor that spun like [...] "a giant hamster wheel". Nolan said of the device, [...] "It was like some incredible torture device; we thrashed Joseph for weeks, but in the end we looked at the footage, and it looks unlike anything any of us has seen before. The rhythm of it is unique, and when you watch it, even if you know <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>done,</b> it confuses your perceptions. It's unsettling in a wonderful way". Gordon-Levitt remembered, [...] "it was six-day weeks of just, like, coming home at night battered ... The light fixtures on the ceiling are coming around on the floor, and you have to choose the right time to cross through them, and if you don't, you're going to fall." [...] On July15,2009, filming took place at University College London for the sequences occurring inside a Paris college of architecture in the story, including the library, Flaxman Gallery and Gustav Tuck Theatre.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to literature, the episode spoofs the Ocean's Trilogy, a film series {{about a group}} of criminals that heist casinos. Selman revealed to Entertainment Weekly in January 2011 that the episode is essentially about [...] "Homer and some people in Springfield hav to perpetrate an Ocean's Eleven–style heist in the non-Ocean's Eleven world of children’s fantasy book publishing." [...] Throughout the episode as the story progresses, title cards with titles such as [...] "The Crew", [...] "The Setup", [...] "The Heist", and [...] "The Payday" [...] appear. During these title cards, which last for about three to four seconds each, a version of the song [...] "Gritty Shaker" [...] by David Holmes is heard. This song was played for approximately three minutes during a scene in Ocean's Eleven. On his blog, The Simpsons music editor Chris Ledesma wrote that Selman wanted [...] "Gritty Shaker" [...] to be played repeatedly throughout [...] "The Book Job" [...] because he erroneously thought that was <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> in film. During the heist of TweenLit Inc.'s headquarters, the screen splits in several ways, showing the different team members making their way to the printing room. According to Selman, [...] "the set-up and feel [...] is a real creative departure for us. It's sort of a heist movie where the heist is writing a book but when that kicks in, there's a giant stylistic leap. It's also a little sillier, a little more stylistic than most episodes. We're coming up on 500 episodes, but really, {{this is the kind of}} episode a show would only do if hadn't already had a couple hundred episodes." [...] Cuban American actor Andy García, who appeared in the Ocean's Trilogy as casino owner Terry Benedict, guest starred in [...] "The Book Job" [...] as the book publishing executive. At the end of January 2011, the recording of his performance took place.|$|E

2500|$|The Fringe is an {{open access}} festival. The role of the Fringe Society is solely to {{facilitate}} the festival, concentrating mainly on the challenging logistics of organising such a large event. [...] Alistair Moffat (Fringe administrator 1976–1981) summarised {{the role of the}} Society when he said, [...] "As {{a direct result of the}} wishes of the participants, the Society had been set up to help the performers that come to Edinburgh and to promote them collectively to the public. It did not come together so that groups could be invited, or in some way artistically vetted. What was performed and <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> was left entirely to each Fringe group". This approach is now sometimes referred to as an unjuried festival, open access arts festival or a fringe festival.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the inquiry}} Wood {{presented}} {{copies of a}} series of coded telegrams written by Overheu. Nairn objected to Wood making private telegrams public but Wood overruled him as they [...] "show that one member of the police party interested himself considerably in getting the defence worked up". The telegrams revealed a network of communication between the [...] "interested parties", local fund raising for the defence that had raised more than ₤1,000 ($68,000 in 2009 dollars) and detailed the [...] "conspiracy" [...] of Gribble organising the killing of Nulla Nulla cattle by mission Aboriginals, giving details of <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>done</b> that Wood found barely credible. More to the point, the telegrams revealed Overheu's hatred of Aborigines, a view supported by a statement to Detective Sergeant Manning by Lyddie, that it was Overhue who continually urged the police to kill the prisoners.|$|E
2500|$|Part of the humour {{comes from}} the fact that Jonathan often does not want to get {{involved}} in other people's problems, and has to be pressured into it by Maddy, Carla or Joey. In [...] "The Scented Room", which centred around a theft from a critic who had lambasted Adam's act, he took great delight in announcing that he had solved the crime but wasn't going to tell anybody <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>done.</b> Initially, Jonathan was only brought in to investigate because he was asked by Maddy due to her having a professional connection to the crime in her role as a journalist, or because it involved an old friend of theirs (Such as one case featuring Jonathan being contacted by an old friend of his mother's after her husband was impaled by a sword in a sealed room). As time went on, he acquired a more significant reputation and was independently recruited by such varied contacts as a chief of police or even the United States military.|$|E
