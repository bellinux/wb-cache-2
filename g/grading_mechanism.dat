40|$|We {{report a}} single-vesicle {{approach}} {{to compare the}} all-or-none and <b>graded</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of lipid bilayer permeabilization by CpreTM and NpreTM, two peptides derived from the membrane-proximal external region of the HIV fusion glycoprotein gp 41 subunit. According to bulk requenching assays, these peptides permeabilize large unilamellar vesicles via all-or-none and <b>graded</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> respectively. Visualization of the process using giant unilamellar vesicles shows that the permeabilization of individual liposomes by these two peptides differs in kinetics, degree of dye filling, and stability of the permeabilized state. All-or-none permeabilization by CpreTM is characterized by fast and total filling of the individual vesicles. This process is usually accompanied by the formation of stably open pores, as judged from {{the capacity of the}} vesicles to incorporate a second dye added after several hours. In contrast, graded permeabilization by NpreTM is transient and exhibits slower kinetics, which leads to partial filling of the individual liposomes. Of importance, quantitative analysis of vesicle population distribution allowed the identification of mixed mechanisms of membrane permeabilization and the assessment of cholesterol effects. Specifically, the presence of this viral envelope lipid increased the stability of the permeating structures, which may have implications for the fusogenic activity of gp 41...|$|R

A shiitake is scanned with a color charge-coupled-device camera and then various geometrical and color characteristics are determined by image processing.

Image processing and algo-rithmic manipulations are done on a personal computer (PC) while grading is carried out by a programmable logic controller (PLC).

After multiple iterations of mechanisms under increasingly realistic assumptions, three are proposed: Calibration, Improved Calibration, and Deduction.

40|$|Ankle sprains {{are among}} the most common acute {{musculoskeletal}} conditions presenting to primary care. Their clinical course is variable but there are limited recommendations on prognostic factors. Our primary aim was to identify clinical predictors of short and medium term functional recovery after ankle sprain. A secondary analysis of data from adult participants (N = 85) with an acute ankle sprain, enrolled in a randomized controlled trial was undertaken. The predictive value of variables (age, BMI, gender, injury mechanism, previous injury, weight-bearing status, medial joint line pain, pain during weight-bearing dorsiflexion and lateral hop test) recorded at baseline and at 4 weeks post injury were investigated for their prognostic ability. Recovery was determined from measures of subjective ankle function at short (4 weeks) and medium term (4 months) follow ups. Multivariate stepwise linear regression analyses were undertaken to evaluate the association between the aforementioned variables and functional recovery. Greater age, greater injury grade and weight-bearing status at baseline were associated with lower function at 4 weeks post injury (p< 0. 01; adjusted R square= 0. 34). Greater age, weight-bearing status at baseline and non-inversion injury mechanisms were associated with lower function at 4 months (p< 0. 01; adjusted R square= 0. 20). Pain on medial palpation and pain on dorsiflexion at 4 weeks were the most valuable prognostic indicators of function at 4 months (p< 0. 01; adjusted R square= 0. 49). The {{results of the present study}} provide further evidence that ankle sprains have a variable clinical course.

40|$|Quality of Experience (QoE) {{consists}} {{of a set of}} indicators that show the perceived satisfaction of using a multimedia (or other kind of) service by the end user. Being so the QoE presents a subjective metric and the only relevant mechanisms for measuring such indicators are subjective tests. Due to the fact that subjective tests are an expensive, impractical and in cases of live streaming a close to impossible exercise we set out on a twofold task to address this issue. First we set out to build prediction models using traditional Machine Learning (ML) techniques based on subjective test data. Second we explore an approach for reduction of the training dataset that will minimize the need for subjective data whilst keeping the prediction models as accurate as possible. For the first goal we used supervised learning based classification algorithms and we came up with high accuracy (over ninety percent) for the prediction models. To address the issue of high cost training data we developed a novel approach in reducing the training dataset while keeping a high accuracy of the classifiers. The reduction method provides a <b>grading</b> <b>mechanism</b> for unseen data.

Recently proposed key management systems (KMSs) provide limited functionality in highly partitioned mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). In this paper we present a framework for key management that provides redundancy and robustness for Security Association (SA) establishment between pairs of nodes in MANETs. Methods: Our KMS uses a modified hierarchical trust Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) model in which nodes can dynamically assume management roles. The system ensures high service availability for the network members {{through a number of}} schemes. A novel behavior <b>grading</b> <b>mechanism</b> provides security criteria for the network nodes and aids the management functions of the KMS to revoke or reissue certificates for nodes.

The Gleason scoring system, a commonly used prognostic indicator of patient outcome, is based on the match of glandular architectural patterns with standard patterns described by D. F. Gleason during the 1970 's. This system defines a five level grading system and currently has a profound impact on patient treatment.

Until now, grading process is still carried out fully manual, so that the grading cost is very expensive about 40 % of total processing cost. Meanwhile, shortage of skill workers is as a limiting factor of the process. Therefore, machine for grading coffee beans is good alternative for grading cost. Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Institute has designed a table vibration type coffee grading machine for grouping of coffee beans in order to consistent quality and reduce grading cost. The machine has dimension of 272 cm length, 126 cm height, and 144 cm width. The machine has three primary components, i. e. grader table, combustion engine, and beam. The machine has three kinds of grader table that each grader table has different holes size, i. e. 7 mm x 7 mm for top grader table, 5 mm x 5 mm for axle grader table, and 4 mm x 4 mm for bottom grader table. Each grader table has dimension of 206 cm length, 105. 5 cm height, and 14 cm width. The <b>grading</b> <b>mechanism</b> is by vibration grader table with the power source 5. 5 HP combustion engine.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} behaviour of transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) -assisted multiphase steels is addressed based on three different microstructures {{generated from the}} same steel <b>grade.</b> The <b>mechanisms</b> responsible for the work-hardening capacity and the resulting balance between strength and resistance to plastic localization are investigated at different length scales. The macroscopic mechanical response is determined by simple shear, uniaxial tension, Marciniak and equibiaxial tension supplemented by earlier tensile tests on notched and cracked specimens. It is shown that the transformation rate reaches a maximum for stress states intermediate between uniaxial tension and equibiaxial tension. At an intermediate length scale, the true in situ flow properties of the individual ferrite bainite and retained austenite phases are determined by combining neutron diffraction and digital image correlation. This combined analysis elucidates the partitioning of stress and strain between the different constitutive phases. Based on these results, supplemented by transmission electron microscopy and electron backscattered diffraction observations, a general overview of the hardening behaviour of TRIP-assisted multiphase steels is depicted.
