5|$|Drug use and overdoses {{increased}} {{significantly in the}} 1800s due to the commercialization and availability of certain drugs. For example, while opium and coca had been used for centuries, their active ingredients, morphine and the cocaine alkaloid, were not isolated until 1803 and 1855 respectively. Cocaine and various opiates were subsequently mass-produced and sold openly and legally in the Western world, resulting in widespread misuse and addiction. Drug use and addiction also {{increased significantly}} following {{the invention of the}} <b>hypodermic</b> <b>syringe</b> in 1853, with overdose being a leading cause of death among intravenous drug users.|$|E
25|$|Morphine {{was first}} {{isolated}} between 1803 and 1805 by Friedrich Sertürner. This is generally {{believed to be}} the first isolation of an active ingredient from a plant. Merck began marketing it commercially in 1827. Morphine was more widely used after the invention of the <b>hypodermic</b> <b>syringe</b> in 1853–1855. Sertürner originally named the substance morphium after the Greek god of dreams, Morpheus, as it has a tendency to cause sleep.|$|E

During these interviews he establishes a timeline that seems impossible: Sarah King places {{the time of death}} considerably before the times at which various of the family members claim last to have seen the victim alive. Attention is focused on a <b>hypodermic</b> <b>syringe</b> that has seemingly been stolen from Dr. Gerard’s tent and later replaced. The poison administered to the victim is believed to be digitoxin, something that she already took medicinally.|$|E
25|$|Hill's {{murder trial}} began on February 15, 1971. Kurth testified against Hill, {{claiming}} that {{he had tried to}} kill her on June 30, 1969, by crashing their car into a bridge, and by injecting her with a <b>hypodermic</b> <b>syringe.</b> She also told the court that he had confessed to killing Robinson Hill, explaining in detail how he had allegedly done it by lacing pastries with infectious bacteria and later injecting Robinson Hill with the same bacteria. As a result of Kurth's testimony, Hill's attorney was granted a request for a mistrial. Hill's second trial was eventually scheduled for November 1972.|$|E
25|$|Chang's {{eventual}} downfall {{was caused}} by his association with Violet Payne, also known as Mary Deval or Ruby Duval. Payne was a chorus girl or actress and a drug addict living in Maple Street, near Tottenham Court Road. On 23 February 1924, police saw Payne in the Commercial Tavern, Pennyfields, with packets of an unknown substance. She {{was taken to the}} police station, searched, and found to have cocaine hidden in the lining of her coat. There were marks on her body indicating the use of a <b>hypodermic</b> <b>syringe.</b> Payne made a statement to the police and Chang's home was searched at 11.30 pm the same day. A single bag of cocaine was found behind a loose board in a cupboard. Chang was subsequently arrested and charged with possessing and supplying cocaine.|$|E

[...] However, the long-term effects of ADAM soon became obvious later, as the substance is highly addictive and both mental and physical deterioration begin to occur.|$|E
50|$|In some jurisdictions, <b>hypodermic</b> <b>syringes</b> are in {{a special}} class of their own, {{regulated}} as illicit drug use accessories separate from regular medical legislation.

2500|$|Hill's {{murder trial}} began on February 15, 1971, before Judge Frederick Hooey. The case was prosecuted by McMaster and Ernst, while Hill was defended by Richard Haynes. Robinson Hill's friend and {{neighbor}} Vann Maxwell {{was the first}} witness to give evidence, and testified that Robinson Hill had said shortly before her death that she {{had given up on}} her marriage. Kurth testified against Hill, claiming that he had tried to kill her on June 30, 1969, by crashing their car into a bridge, and by injecting her with a <b>hypodermic</b> <b>syringe.</b> She also told the court that he had confessed to killing Robinson Hill. Kurth claimed to have seen three petri dishes in the bathroom of John Hill's apartment during the time Joan Robinson Hill became ill. [...] She said they had [...] "something red in them" [...] and when she asked Hill about it, he told her he was conducting an experiment. Kurth testified that Hill was annoyed at her discovery and the next day, when she found some pastries in the apartment's refrigerator, he became annoyed again, telling her not to eat them.|$|E

60|$|I {{was horrified}} by my {{first glimpse of}} Holmes next morning, for he sat by the fire holding his tiny <b>hypodermic</b> <b>syringe.</b> I {{associated}} that instrument with the single weakness of his nature, and I feared the worst when I saw it glittering in his hand.

For some little time his eyes rested thoughtfully upon the sinewy forearm and wrist all dotted and scarred with innumerable puncture-marks. Finally he thrust the sharp point home, pressed down the tiny piston, and sank back into the velvet-lined arm-chair with a long sigh of satisfaction.|$|E
60|$|So Bickley and I said to each other, and yet {{presently}} {{he changed}} his mind and in a special metal machine carefully made some extremely strong black coffee which he poured into a thermos flask, previously warmed with hot water, adding thereto about a claret glass of brandy. Also he extracted certain drugs from his medicine-chest, and with them, as I noted, a <b>hypodermic</b> <b>syringe,</b> which he first boiled in a kettle and then shut up in a little tube with a glass stopper.|$|E
50|$|Medical-grade {{disposable}} <b>hypodermic</b> <b>syringes</b> {{are often}} used in research laboratories for convenience and low cost.

60|$|Nor was he {{satisfied}} with this precaution. After aimlessly moving chairs {{about for a}} few minutes, and prowling {{up and down the}} room, he paused and listened. What he heard induced him to stuff his pocket-handkerchief into the keyhole, and to lay the hearth-rug across the considerable chink which, as is usual, admitted a healthy draught under the bottom of the door. Then the Honorable Mr. Cranley drew down the blinds, and unpacked his various purchases. He set them out on the table in order--the oranges, the phial, and the <b>hypodermic</b> <b>syringe.</b>|$|E
60|$|Thus pondering, this astute miscreant {{stopped at}} Covent Garden, {{dismissed}} his cab, and purchased {{a basket of}} very fine Jaffa oranges. He then hailed another cab, and drove with his parcel to the shop of an eminent firm of chemists, again dismissing his cab. In the shop {{he asked for a}} certain substance, which it may be as well not to name, and got what he wanted in a small phial, marked poison. Mr. Cranley then called a third cab, gave the direction of a surgical-instrument maker's (also eminent), and amused his leisure during the drive in removing the label from the bottle. At the surgical-instrument maker's he complained of neuralgia, and purchased a <b>hypodermic</b> <b>syringe</b> for injecting morphine or some such anodyne into his arm. À fourth cab took him back to the house in Victoria Square, where he let himself in with a key, entered the dining-room, and locked the door.|$|E

50|$|In {{the sport}} of fencing, blades used in {{competitions}} run {{under the auspices of}} the Fédération Internationale d'Escrime are usually made with maraging steel. Maraging blades are superior for foil and épée because crack propagation in maraging steel is 10 times slower than in carbon steel, resulting in less blade breakage and fewer injuries. Stainless maraging steel is used in bicycle frames and golf club heads. It is also used in surgical components and <b>hypodermic</b> <b>syringes,</b> but is not suitable for scalpel blades because the lack of carbon prevents it from holding a good cutting edge.|$|R

They carried a pouch with 14 <b>hypodermic</b> <b>syringes</b> and {{a supply of}} potassium chloride. According to court testimony provided by the perpetrators later, they planned to use the chemical substance to kidnap Sakamoto from Yokohama's Shinkansen train station, but, contrary to expectations, he did not show up—it was a holiday (Bunka no hi, or [...] "Culture Day"), so he slept in with his family, at home.|$|R
