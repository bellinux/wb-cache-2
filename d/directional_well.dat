40|$|Increasing {{interest}} is now focused on directional survey {{and on the}} uncertainty inherent in the calculation of the bottom hole coordinates because many wells are drilled from offshore platforms and urban drill sites. These uncertainties may result from errors due to the limitation on instrument accuracy, unconcentric positioning of the tools with the borehole and may include reading errors. It is therefore necessary to develop methods for determining {{the cumulative effect of}} these errors on the bottomhole coordinates and reducing such effects. In this study, Monte Carlo simulation method is adopted as a technique of achieving this objective. The inclination angle, Ii and the azimuthal angle, Ai are treated as random variables with their associated probability density function P(Ii) and P(Ai) respectively. These represent the distributions of the potential survey measurements in a given well. The parameter Si which represents the linear segment constituting the curvilinear axis of the wellbore is treated deterministically since its values can be measured accurately. Treating Ii and Ai as random variables in a wellbore model is justified by the fact that both of them, though deterministic, can hardly ever be measured accurately in any subsurface survey. The results of the study show that the probability of the estimated bottomhole positions being true is nearly unity for vertical well and slightly less for <b>directional</b> <b>well...</b>|$|E

40|$|Fluid {{pressure}} {{is a crucial}} factor to tubular string strength and deformation in oil and gas wells, {{and it is the}} most difficult factor to deal with. When the string constrained by downhole tools, such as packers, action pattern of fluid on string is changed. Calculation methods of string stress and deformation given by engineering handbooks doesn’t distinguish these issues in detail. So mistakes are often made when these methods are used. Tangled concepts lead to large calculation error. In this paper, the influence of fluid pressure on string axial force and deformation, buoyancy treatment in packed condition, are discussed roundly both in vertical wells and directional wells. Practical calculating method of string axial force through the hook load is presented, and element buoyancy in different borehole trajectory is given. It is found that the traditional simplified buoyancy coefficient method, which is used to calculate string axial force and axial extension, can only be used in vertical wells with tubular string suspended freely, because in this condition buoyancy acts on the bottom of string. If the string is constrained by downhole tools, such as packer or anchor, buoyancy could not be treated as usual. In <b>directional</b> <b>well</b> the buoyancy not only changes string axial force but induces shear stress in string cross section. When calculating the influence of fluid on string, operation sequence and constraints from borehole and downhole tools should be considered comprehensively...|$|E

40|$|Due to some {{drawbacks}} {{of conventional}} drilling methods and drilling tools, {{the application of}} hydraulic hammers with a fluidic amplifier have been extensively popularized since its emergence in recent years. However, the performance life of a fluidic amplifier is still unsatisfactory in oil and gas wells drilling, especially the heavy wear or erosion of the fluidic amplifier leads to the reduction of service life time of hydraulic hammers, which {{is derived from the}} incision of drilling muds with high speed and pressure. In order to investigate the influence of drilling muds, such as particle size, solid content and jet velocity, on the antierosion property of a fluidic amplifier, several groups of drilling muds with different performance parameters have been utilized to numerical simulation on basis of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Simulation results have shown that the jet nozzle of fluidic amplifiers is primarily abraded, afterwards are the lateral plates and the wedge of the fluidic amplifier, which shows extraordinary agreement with the actual cases of fluidic amplifier in drilling process. It can be concluded that particle size, solid content and jet velocity have a great influence on the anti-erosion property of a fluidic amplifier, and the erosion rate linearly varies with the particle size of drilling muds, nevertheless exponentially varies with solid content and jet velocity of drilling muds.

40|$|Approximately 50 % of {{the cost}} of a new {{geothermal}} power plant is in the wells that must be drilled. Compared to the majority of oil and gas wells, geothermal wells are more difficult and costly to drill for several reasons. First, most U. S. geothermal resources consist of hot, hard crystalline rock formations which drill much slower than the relatively soft sedimentary formations associated with most oil and gas production. Second, high downhole temperatures can greatly shorten equipment life or preclude the use of some technologies altogether. Third, producing viable levels of electricity from geothermal fields requires the use of large diameter bores and a high degree of fluid communication, both of which increase drilling and completion costs. Optimizing fluid communication often requires creation of a <b>directional</b> <b>well</b> to intersect the best and largest number of fracture capable of producing hot geothermal fluids. Moineau motor stators made with elastomers cannot operate at geothermal temperatures, so they are limited to the upper portion of the hole. To overcome these limitations, Maurer Engineering Inc. (MEI) has developed a turbodrill that does not use elastomers and therefore can operate at geothermal temperatures. This new turbodrill uses a special gear assembly to reduce the output speed, thus allowing a larger range of bit types, especially tri-cone roller bits, which are the bits of choice for drilling hard crystalline formations. The Advanced Geothermal Turbodrill (AGT) represents a significant improvement for drilling geothermal wells and has the potential to significantly reduce drilling costs while increasing production, thereby making geothermal energy less expensive and better able to compete with fossil fuels.

30|$|Shale {{formations}} exhibit {{very low}} permeability excluding fractures; the permeability is ranging from nanodarcies to microdarcies (e.g. Cipolla et al. 2010). The reservoirs having less than 0.1  mD permeability {{are said to}} be unconventional reservoirs (e.g. Law and Curtis 2002). However, the shale gas reservoirs fall within the unconventional category of reservoirs (e.g. Boyer et al. 2011). As the shale gas reservoirs have extremely poor permeability and low productivity could not produce gas at commercial rate, therefore, it is essential to fracture these reservoirs and drill horizontal wells to make these profitable. Hence, the shale gas reservoir can result in profitable gas production with application of advanced technology such as hydraulically fracturing and horizontal drilling (e.g. Sunjay and Kothari 2011). Reservoir management studies are essential for every oil and gas company’s project feasibility. Similarly, for shale gas project, profitability assessment prior to any activity such as drilling <b>directional</b> <b>well</b> or horizontal wells and performing fracturing jobs on such low-permeability wells; it is essential to evaluate the shale gas reserves profitability based on their maturity, total organic content, fractions of gas either adsorbed or free present within matrix or fractures, its areal extent and the thickness of the reservoir as well as fluid flow capacity. Aforementioned parameters are the main parameters for shale gas reservoir development (e.g. Boyer et al. 2011). In published literature, authors have reported that commerciality of shale gas reservoir could only be achieved if its porosity and permeability values are greater than 4 % and 100 nanodarcies, respectively. However, the saturation of water should be less than 45 % and the TOC must be greater than 2 %, and all above proposed values are critical for shale gas production at profitable level (e.g. Gutierrez et al. 2009).|$|E
