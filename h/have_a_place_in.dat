25|$|Though the United Kingdom once {{favored the}} French system, Buffet-system {{instruments}} {{are no longer}} made there and the last prominent British player of the French system retired in the 1980s.

Buffet-model bassoons are currently made in Paris by Buffet Crampon and the atelier Ducasse (Romainville, France). The Selmer Company stopped fabrication of French system bassoons a few years ago. Some players, for example the late Gerald Corey in Canada, have learned to play both types and will alternate between them depending on the repertoire.|$|E

25|$|The {{depiction}} of prophets, apostles, saints, patriarchs {{and other people}} associated with the church often <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the decorative scheme. The thematic use of such figures may be a very obvious one. There may, for example, be a row of stained glass windows showing the prophets that predicted {{the coming of the}} Messiah. Or within a carved stone screen might stand statues of those monarchs who were particularly devoted to the church. The apostles, usually twelve in number but sometimes accompanied by St Paul, John the Baptist, Mary Magdalene and others, are a frequent subject. The upright, standing figures particularly lent themselves to architectural decoration and they often appear in a columnar form around doorways or in tiers on the façades of cathedrals.|$|E
25|$|To {{address the}} {{concerns}} of Canadian citizens about how various human rights issues would be covered in the museum, Cassie provided a more detailed explanation of the actual process for public consultation and corrected misconceptions {{that may have been}} perpetrated by the media, particularly in relation to gallery content.

Cassie also explained that the Content Advisory Committee's mandate had expired in March 2010, and that its submitted recommendations constituted only part of the consultation process. The first round of public consultations that had begun in May 2009, was completed in February 2010.|$|E
25|$|Strauss {{was thus}} omitted from England cricket {{fixtures}} over the winter. He {{returned to the}} Test squad for the tour of New Zealand, however made only four in the first warm up match before hitting his own wicket. Despite what was now over 25 Test innings without a century, Strauss was chosen ahead of Owais Shah (who scored 96 in the same warm up match) {{to play in the}} second warm up match, sparking speculation that he would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the Test squad for the first match against New Zealand. Strauss was, however, placed in the number three spot on the batting order, leaving Vaughan and Cook to open as they did in Sri Lanka. His batting in the first innings was poor, and he was dismissed for 5. In the second innings, however, he was returned to the position of opener and scored 104* along with Ian Bell.|$|E

25|$|The {{starting}} point of the scholarly controversy is the disputed meaning of the Greek concept of ousia. This is an ordinary Greek word and literally means 'being.' In philosophical contexts, it is usually translated by 'Being' or 'Essence.' Plato's Republic says that the Good is 'not ousia' but is rather 'beyond ousia' and surpasses it as an origin and in power. If this passage implies only that the essence or nature of the Good is beyond Being (but not the Good itself), or if the passage is just interpreted loosely, then the Form of the Good can retain its place inside {{the realm of the}} Forms, i.e., the realm of things with real Being. In this case the Good is not absolutely transcendent: it does not transcend Being and somehow exist above it. The Good would therefore <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the hierarchy of real Beings. According to this interpretation, the Good is not an issue for the two principles of the unwritten doctrines but only for the Theory of Forms. On the other hand, if the passage in the Republic is read literally and 'ousia' means 'Being,' then the phrase 'beyond Being' implies the Good actually transcends Being. According to this interpretation, Plato considered the Good to be absolutely transcendent and it must be integrated into the realm of the two principles.|$|E
