5|$|The {{challenge}} with Kibble balances {{is not only}} in reducing their uncertainty, but also in making them truly practical realizations of the kilogram. Nearly every aspect of Kibble balances and their support equipment requires such extraordinarily precise and accurate, state-of-the-art technology that—unlike a device like an atomic clock—few countries would currently choose to fund their operation. For instance, the NIST's Kibble balance used four resistance standards in 2007, each of which was rotated through the Kibble balance every two to six weeks after being calibrated in {{a different part of}} NIST headquarters facility in Gaithersburg, Maryland. It was found that simply moving the resistance standards <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Kibble balance after calibration altered their values 10ppb (equivalent to 10µg) or more. Present-day technology is insufficient to permit stable operation of Kibble balances between even biannual calibrations. If the kilogram is defined in terms of the Planck constant, it is likely there will only be a few—at most—Kibble balances initially operating in the world.|$|E
60|$|As if {{with one}} accord they moved <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{door of the}} young man's room.|$|E
6000|$|... "To dance will limber me, beyond doubt," [...] she declared, {{with a wave}} of her hand. She {{watched him}} pass <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> elevator; then she went back to her sitting-room.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tired of frivolity, my dear?" [...] {{asked her}} uncle, pausing in his {{walk up and}} <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> glance {{at her with a}} quick, bright look she liked to bring into his eyes.|$|R
60|$|He {{passed his}} arm through hers {{and led her}} <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> where <b>the</b> Professor and Laura were {{just waiting for the}} lift. He beckoned them to follow him to a corner of the lounge.|$|R
60|$|Later, Phil {{talked to}} her about his longing {{to be a great}} surgeon--in which he had the {{tremendous}} advantage of being almost sincere. He walked <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> her room, and said good-night lingeringly, holding her hand.|$|R
60|$|Her {{indolence}} {{turned to}} energy as she charged <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> large double {{door on the}} right and threw it open, revealing to him a scene of splendor and revelry by night.|$|E
60|$|The {{man seemed}} to look about him keenly for a moment, then vanished, and the steps went <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front door, which was opened {{from within and}} some one {{admitted}} quietly. Whispers were heard, and then feet approached again, accompanied by a gleam of light.|$|E
60|$|She led him <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door of Ted's {{room and}} pushed it gently open. On the worn brown rug he saw a froth of rose-colored chiffon lingerie; on the sedate Morris chair a girl's silver slipper. And on the pillows were two sleepy heads--Ted's and Eunice's.|$|E
6000|$|At nine-thirty {{that evening}} he combed and tightly brushed his hair, {{which he had}} been pawing angrily {{for an hour and a}} half, went <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> Nelly's <b>hall</b> bedroom, and knocked with: [...] "It's Mr. Wrenn. May I ask you {{something}} about the play?" ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{the guards}} seized {{the three of}} them to lead them away, and the frightened babe set up a thin, {{piercing}} wail, while the Bishop and his companions, preceded by one of the monks bearing the candle--it was that Ambrose who had choked Emlyn--marched in procession <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> gain <b>the</b> great door.|$|R
60|$|The armor, of course, varied {{very much}} in its {{character}} and fashion, according to the age in which the monarch who wore it lived; {{and it was very}} interesting, in walking <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> <b>to</b> see how military fashions had changed from century to century, as shown by the successive changes in the accoutrements which were observed in passing along the line of kings.|$|R
6000|$|LILY--[Jumping up.] I'll bet that's we Jaysons now. [She runs to {{the door}} in the rear and looks <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right.] Yes, it's Esther and husband and Aunt Davidson. [She comes back to MARTHA {{laughing}} excitedly. The MAID is seen going to the door.] The first wave of attack, Martha! Be brave! The Young Guard dies but never surrenders! ...|$|E
6000|$|It was {{a pretty}} flat, of white {{woodwork}} and soft blue walls. Mrs. Judique gushed with pleasure as she agreed to take it, and as they walked <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> elevator she touched his sleeve, caroling, [...] "Oh, I'm so glad I went to you! It's such a privilege to meet a man who really Understands. Oh! The flats SOME people have showed me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{must have}} {{left her in}} the room where the King's throne is," [...] decided Dorothy, and at once she turned and ran <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door through which they had entered. But it was fast closed and locked on the other side, and the heavy slab of rock proved to be so thick that no sound could pass through it. So Dorothy was forced to return to her chamber.|$|E
50|$|During the night, {{the narrator}} hears heavy {{footsteps}} climbing the stairs; but he assumes {{that it is}} a drunken Alphonse going to bed. In the morning, after the cock's crow, he hears the same steps retreating <b>down</b> <b>the</b> stairs. Suddenly, there is screaming and commotion. <b>The</b> narrator runs <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> find a crowd of people surrounding the dead Alphonse, who looks as though he died in a fiery embrace.|$|R
25|$|Hearing the commotion, Paules went <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> Taboada's {{bedroom and}} saw Rolling. She {{attempted}} to barricade {{herself in her}} bedroom but Rolling broke through the door. Rolling taped her mouth and wrists, cut off her clothing and raped her, before turning her onto her belly and stabbing her {{three times in the}} back. Rolling posed Paules' body but left Taboada's in the same position in which he had died.|$|R
50|$|Mooney and Richmond hurriedly {{cover the}} body and duck under the bed. Horace and Millie {{discover}} {{the body and}} run <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> enlist <b>the</b> help of the hotel detective, Pat Callahan (Warren Hymer). While they are gone, Mooney and Richmond stuff the body into Millie’s empty trunk, then escape out the window. When Horace and Millie return again, the body is gone, so Callahan leaves in a huff.|$|R
50|$|A {{corridor}} leads <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west in a single-wing-like bracket style using single rafters.|$|E
50|$|Left of the stairs, <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{right is}} where the antique cameras and {{equipment}} used by Dr. Legarda before is displayed. He was recognized as the oldest living member of the “Camera Club of the Philippines” {{at the time of}} his death in 1993.|$|E
5000|$|CT40 Vault, {{heard at}} the end of the second hour. [...] "A walk <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> vault for a {{sampling}} of country music history" [...] by spotlighting clips of songs from past decades, and ending with the playing of a song in its entirety from the last decade (i.e. #1 from this week 48 years ago, 28 years ago, 18 years ago, 8 years ago).|$|E
50|$|Hearing the commotion, Paules went <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> Taboada's {{bedroom and}} saw Rolling. She {{attempted}} to barricade {{herself in her}} bedroom but Rolling broke through the door. Rolling taped her mouth and wrists, cut off her clothing and raped her, before turning her onto her belly and stabbing her {{three times in the}} back.

60|$|Trenchard, who was {{by way of}} {{enjoying himself}} now, stepped briskly <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> do as his friend bade him, with a wary eye on the tything-men. But never {{so much as a}} finger did they dare to lift. Mr. Wilding's calm was too deadly; they had seen a man in earnest before this, and they knew his {{appearance}} now. From the doorway Trenchard called Mr. Wilding.|$|R
5000|$|On June 4, 2010, Kyron {{was brought}} to school by his stepmother, Terri Horman (née Moulton), who then stayed with him while he {{attended}} a science fair. Terri Horman stated that she left the school at around 8:45 a.m. and remembered seeing Kyron walking <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> his first class. [...] However, he was never seen in his first math class; instead, he was marked absent {{for the day and}} has not been seen since.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{scheduling}} conflicts for the booking {{of studio}} time and broadcast time, The Lone Shark was often recorded {{within an hour}} of its actual broadcast, with little or no time to edit the program. Many times, the just-recorded program tapes were literally run <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> broadcast facility with only minutes or seconds until the program’s on-air broadcast time. The Lone Shark was basically being broadcast as a taped-but-unedited live program.|$|E
5000|$|After {{an ongoing}} argument, John Bennett went {{to pack a}} {{suitcase}} as he told Myrtle to retrieve the handgun he typically carried {{on the road for}} protection. Myrtle walked <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bedroom of her mother, Alice Adkins. Still sobbing, Myrtle reached into a drawer with linens and pulled out his [...]32 Colt automatic, and walked into the den. There, she brushed past Charles Hofman and in a moment, and shot at John's back twice in the bathroom of the apartment. John escaped into the hallway, but fell to the ground in their living room.|$|E
50|$|A heavy storm brews outside, and George hears {{a monstrous}} growl from the bedroom. It is his {{grandmother}} asking George for her tea. George is startled and hides, but convinces himself he's {{too old to}} behave this way and resigns himself to bring the tea. As he walks <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Gramma's room, George recalls conversations in which his mother and her siblings discussed how dangerous Gramma is now that she's senile. As George enters Gramma's room, he considers how awful {{it would be if}} she died while he was alone with her. A gnarled hand reaches out from the bedclothes. This startles George, and he drops the tea tray and flees the room.|$|E
50|$|Upon the {{departure}} of Offenbach, the new director tore <b>down</b> <b>the</b> existing <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> erect a larger one with a capacity of 1100 spectators.|$|R
60|$|Wulf {{despatched}} one of <b>the</b> men <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> {{bring up}} <b>the</b> interpreter. As {{soon as he}} arrived Wulf doffed his helmet and stepped forward.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll show you." [...] Reinhart led Sherikov <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> his office. They {{entered and}} Reinhart locked the door. He handed Sherikov the toy and roughed in what Cole had done. A strange look crossed Sherikov's face. He found the studs {{on the box}} and {{depressed}} them. The box opened. The big Pole sat <b>down</b> at <b>the</b> desk and began to study {{the interior of the}} box. [...] "You're sure it was the man from the past who rewired this?" ...|$|R
50|$|A little later, Cincinnatus meets Emmie, {{the prison}} director's daughter. He tries to coax her into {{revealing}} his execution date as well, but eventually gives up and busies himself with reading the foolish prisoner's rules etched {{into the walls}} of his cell, and flipping through the book catalog administered to him by the librarian. Eventually Rodrig comes back to tell Cincinnatus the other prisoner has arrived, and that he will also be allowed to see Marthe. Cincinnatus probes him for a specific date and time to meet Marthe, however Rodrig believes he is talking about the new prisoner, and takes him <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> man's cell where Cincinnatus can observe him through a peephole.|$|E
50|$|From the {{beginning}} of Ferguson's tenure as host until August 10, 2012, The Late Late Show continued to originate from Studio 58 at CBS Television City, as it had {{dating back to the}} show's origins under Snyder. Ferguson often joked about the studio's small size, leaky roof, and poor lighting. On August 27, 2012, the program moved <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> much larger Studio 56. Though the look of the main desk set was similar to the one in Studio 58, the extra space in Studio 56 allowed for more audience seating, a fireplace set for Geoff Peterson, an entrance & monologue set, a musical performance area, as well as a stable set for the show's pantomime horse, Secretariat.|$|E
50|$|The two Challengers {{that were}} chosen to compete were Ashley and Msgana along with the two Fans which were Jonathan and Noah. There were two teams {{consisting}} of one challenger and one fan. The Green Team was Ashley and Noah, and Yellow Team was Msgana and Jonathan. Some of the tasks were to find and feed cockroaches to lizards, weigh a python, feeding a boa a dead mouse, and finally find a clue card in various tarantula tanks and running <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gift shop, where the end was. Green was in first the whole time and finished first. Yellow was last the whole time, and finished Last. There is a shortened version of this episode found on the in real life website, while the full version was aired on TV in December 2011.|$|E

5000|$|Fallon hosted {{his final}} episode of Late Night on February 7, 2014, when he welcomed Andy Samberg as his final guest. After a brief {{retrospective}} with Higgins about {{their time on}} Late Night, the show ended with Fallon playing drums and singing backup to [...] "The Weight" [...] behind an ensemble of The Muppets. Upon {{the conclusion of the}} song, Fallon exited Studio 6A and walked silently <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> Studio 6B, through a door featuring his Tonight Show logo, where his cast and crew awaited him with an ovation.|$|R
60|$|Eustace had {{accompanied}} {{his mother to}} America. It was his faint snores which she could hear in the adjoining room as, having bathed and dressed, she went <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>to</b> where breakfast awaited her. She smiled tolerantly. She had never desired to convert her son to her own early-rising habits, for, apart from not allowing him to call his soul his own, she was an indulgent mother. Eustace would get up at half-past nine, long after she had finished breakfast, read her correspondence, and started her duties for the day.|$|R
