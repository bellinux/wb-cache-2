500|$|In 1918, Noether {{published}} a seminal {{paper on the}} inverse Galois problem. Instead of determining the Galois group of transformations of a given field and its extension, Noether asked whether, given a field and a group, it always is possible to find {{an extension of the}} field that has the given group as its Galois group. She reduced this to [...] "Noether's problem", which asks whether the <b>fixed</b> <b>field</b> of a subgroup G of the permutation group S'n acting on the field [...] always is a pure transcendental extension of the field k. (She first mentioned this problem in a 1913 paper, where she attributed the problem to her colleague Fischer.) She showed this was true for , 3, or 4. In 1969, R. G. Swan found a counter-example to Noether's problem, with [...] and G a cyclic group of order 47 (although this group can be realized as a Galois group over the rationals in other ways).

40|$|Abstract. There is {{a serious}} {{discrepancy}} among literature on the Picard-Vessiot theory in positive characteristics (for iterative differential fields). We consider descriptions of Galois correspondence in four approaches to this subject: Okugawa’s result [7], Takeuchi’s Hopf algebraic approach [11] (and [3]), the result of Matzat and van der Put [6], and the model theoretic approach by Pillay [8]. In the three approaches except Takeuchi’s one, Galois correspondence is described between closed subgroups of algebraic matrix groups and its <b>fixed</b> <b>fields.</b> But such a description has a problem that the Galois correspondence may not be bijective there. We explain this problem {{in the first section}} by giving an explicit example. We should use affine group schemes instead of algebraic matrix groups to obtain a suitable Galois correspondence, as in Takeuchi’s approach. But intermediate fields are not necessarily <b>fixed</b> <b>fields</b> there. In the second section, we give some sufficient conditions for intermediate artinian simple module algebras to be fixed algebras {{in the context of the}} unified Picard-Vessiot theory developed by the author and Masuoka [3]...|$|R
