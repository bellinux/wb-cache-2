50|$|A lugworm {{lives in}} a U-shaped burrow in sand. The U is made of an L-shaped gallery lined with mucus, from the toe of which a {{vertical}} unlined shaft runs up to the surface. This is a <b>head</b> <b>shaft.</b> At the surface the <b>head</b> <b>shaft</b> {{is marked by a}} small saucer-shaped depression. The tail shaft, 2 to 3 in from it, is marked by a highly coiled cast of sand. The lugworm lies in this burrow with its head {{at the base of the}} <b>head</b> <b>shaft,</b> swallowing sand from time to time. This makes the columns of sand drop slightly, so there is a periodic sinking of the sand in the saucer-shaped depression. When it first digs its burrow the lugworm softens the sand in its <b>head</b> <b>shaft</b> by pushing its head up into it with a piston action. After that the sand is kept loose by a current of water driven through the burrow from the hind end by the waves of contraction passing along the worm's body. It weighs 2 to 5 oz. Lugworms also have hairs on the outside of their bodies that act as external gills. These can rapidly increase its uptake of oxygen.|$|E
30|$|The blade {{exit angle}} has higher {{influence}} on the <b>head,</b> <b>shaft</b> power and hydraulic efficiency while the inlet blade angle has lower effect on the parameters. Large exit blade angle always augments head generation with increased input power consumption. Increase in exit blade angle increases the hydraulic efficiency till the design point. At off-design points, the efficiency decreases for higher exit blade angles because of different losses.|$|E
40|$|Background: Valgus {{subtrochanteric}} osteotomy is {{the gold}} standard surgical treatment of developmental coxa vara. Nevertheless, {{there has been no}} consensus on the method of fixation and osteotomy details. In the literature, there are few reports on employing rigid internal fixation methods that preclude the need of postoperative immobilization. We present early radiologic and clinical outcome of a modified Y shaped subtrochanteric valgus osteotomy fixed with precontoured DCP. Patients and Methods: Ten patients with 10 hips of developmental coxa vara were subjected to a corrective Y-shaped subtrochanteric valgus femoral osteotomy. All the cases were fixed by a precontoured small dynamic compression plate (DCP). There were six males and four females. The right hip was affected in four patients and the left hip in six. The average age at the presentation time was 5. 1 years (range 4 - 9 years). Clinical evaluation was done by IOWA hip score. Results: Clinically, the IOWA hip score improved postoperatively significantly (P<. 05). The average preoperative <b>head</b> <b>shaft</b> angle was 94 ° (range 85 °- 100 °) and the average post-operative <b>head</b> <b>shaft</b> angle was 120 ° (range 115 °- 125 °). Postoperatively, the average epiphyseal-Hilgenreiner angle and the head-shaft angle fell into the normal values. No recurrence of deformity was reported. Conclusion: The Y-shaped subtrochanteric valgus osteotomy with rigid internal fixation precludes the use of external immobilization attained satisfactory clinical and radiologic results with no evidence of deformity recurrence on the short-term follow-up...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} blade {{discharge}} angle {{on the performance}} of a standard industrial centrifugal oil pump of type 65 Y 60 &# 13; were investigated experimentally as the pump handled both water and viscous oil.

Gubernacula {{of some of the}} species were also excised, and their structure was determined. The two spicules of all species examined were symmetrically identical in morphology. The spicule typically consisted of three parts: <b>head,</b> <b>shaft,</b> and blade with dorsal and ventral vela. The spicular nerve entered through the cytoplasmic core opening on the lateral outer surface of the spicule head and generally communicated with the exterior through one or two pores at the spicule tip. Spicules of Xiphinema sp. and Aporcelaimellus sp. were not composed of three typical parts, were less sclerotized, and lacked a cytoplasmic core opening and distal pores. Spicules of Aphelenchoides spp. had heads expanded into apex and rostrum and had very arcuate blades with thick dorsal and ventral edges (limbs). Gubernaculum shapes were stable within a species, but differed among species examined. The accessory structures of Hoplolaimus galeatus consisted of a tongue-shaped gubernaculum with two titillae at its distal end and a plate-like capitulum terminating distally in two flat, wing-like structures.

30|$|According to the Neer {{classification}} (Neer 1970 a, b), {{the decision}} regarding {{the treatment of}} proximal humeral fractures is dependent on whether the four anatomical segments of the proximal humeral (the humeral <b>head,</b> <b>shaft,</b> and greater and lesser tubercles) are fractured or displaced. In our paper, CPHFs mean proximal humeral fractures excluding non- or minimally displaced proximal humeral fractures. CPHFs have poor outcomes and the optimal treatment is still controversial. There are several kinds of surgical methods for patients with CPHFs, including steosynthesis, hemiarthroplasty and reverse shoulder arthroplasty (Murray et al. 2011). Whether surgical methods could help to resume the painless range of motion and good shoulder function, thereby allow for rapid return to work and previous level of activity is still unclear. We performed this updated meta-analysis concerning the comparison of operative and non-operative treatment for the CPHFs. This meta-analysis was based on 7 RCTs in 9 articles (Rangan et al. 2015; Fjalestad and Hole 2014; Fjalestad et al. 2010, 2012; Boons et al. 2012; Olerud et al. 2011 a, b; Zyto et al. 1997; Stableforth 1984). In this study, we compared the efficiency and safety of surgical and conservative interventions for CPHFs in elderly patients. The results of this meta-analysis indicated that surgical intervention only improved the ED- 5 D at 24 mo but suffered more complications. Meanwhile, no statistical differences were observed in CS scores, DASH scores, ED- 5 D at 12 mo and 15 D.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{is based on}} the performance of the centrifugal pump having the backward, radial and forward bladed type of impeller. The impeller is modeled using Creo Parametric 1. 0 having 70 and 80 degree outlet blade angle for the backward type and outlet blade angle 90 for radial and 100 degree for forward type impeller respectively. Numerical simulation is carried out using ANSYS CFX and standard k- turbulence model is adopted for the analysis purpose. Cavitation is clearly predicted in the form of water vapor formation inside the centrifugal pump. The performance of the pump is affected by the cavitation and hence cavitation number (σc) {{is a measure of the}} cavitation phenomenon for the centrifugal pump, it is determined by analytical calculations. From the numerical results it has been found that the pump working on low head gives the best performance when it is operated with the backward bladed type impeller. SHI Weidong [2] found that the oversize impeller outlet width leads to poor pump performances and increasing shaft power. W. G. Li [3] stated that the blade discharge angle has a strong but equal influence on the <b>head,</b> <b>shaft</b> power and efficiency of the centrifugal oil pump for various viscosities of liquids pumped, The rapid reduction in the hydraulic and mechanical efficiencies is responsible for the pump performance degradation with increasing viscosity of liquids. E. C. Bacharoudis et al [4] found that the outlet blade angle increases the performance curve becomes smoother and flatter. But pump performance goes down when the pump handles high viscosity working fluids is that high viscosity results in disc friction losses over outside of the impeller and that was found by M. H. S.

40|$|The lack of {{detailed}} descriptions makes positive identification of individual {{bones of the}} human hand difficult. In some instances, labelled photographs and line diagrams depicting a few anatomical features {{are available in the}} literature while in other cases, unlabelled photographs and diagrams are provided. Textbooks generally describe each hand bone as having a <b>head,</b> <b>shaft</b> and base. The morphology of metacarpals is more commonly described than that of the phalanges. Thus, identification and siding of hand bones are rare, which excludes them from use in many forensic cases. Forensic anthropological studies also include the determination of demographic characteristics such as stature and sex. Parts of the human skeleton that are accurate predictors in determining stature and sex include the skull, pelvis, femur and tibia. Hand bones are often excluded from such studies due to their relatively small size and poor preservation. The aims of this study were firstly, to provide detailed morphological descriptions of metacarpals and phalangeal bones of the human hand; secondly, to develop regression formulae for stature using the hand bones and thirdly, to develop discriminant function formulae in which the hand bones can be used to determine the sex of an unknown individual. The study comprised 200 sets of hands of South African individuals. The results indicate that there are morphological features of individual bones of the human hand {{that can be used to}} identify and side them. Regression formulae have been devised whereby the length of a hand bone can be regressed to that of a long bone, which in turn can then be used to determine stature. The sexing accuracy, using the bones of the hand, is high for males and females. Average accuracies recorded were more than 80 % in most cases, and more than 75 % in all cases. Analyses of human hand bones can thus add valuable information when assessing skeletons of unknown individuals. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010. Anatomyunrestricte...|$|E

40|$|Sediments offer {{microorganisms}} an unexplored {{numbers of}} niches {{with the opportunity}} to evolve specialized microbial communities. The small size of microbial niches in biogeochemical gradients in sediments called for a high resolution study of the populations. We applied a genetic fingerprint method, the terminal restriction fragment polymorphism (T-RFLP), to characterize the diversity of the 16 S rRNA gene present in thin sediment layers at which one TRF represents one operational taxonomic unit (OTU). A partial gene amplification and restriction enzyme digestion of the amplicon allows the detection of about 150 different fragments in an intensity range of 100 to 10000 relative fluorescence units as a picture of the richness and evenness of the bacterial community. The T-RFLP method was established for intertidal soft sediments from the Wadden Sea, the North Sea. The variations in the results were correlated to variations in individual steps of the method protocol. Restriction enzyme digest and digest analysis on a capillary sequencer correlated with a dissimilarity of about 20 % and 10 % in the obtained replicate datasets describing one pooled amplicon from one DNA sample after binning with a fixed window size of 0. 5 and 1 base pair, respectively. The biases in individual PCR reactions did not increase the dissimilarity after performing independent T-RFLP analyses from one DNA sample. The dissimilarity was partly caused by an imperfect binning. Working with a high resolution window size of 0. 5 bp, no starting point (50. 25, 50. 20, 50. 30 and 50. 65 bp) gave a perfect binning result. Some of identical TRFs were always binned into two different TRFs, thus creating an additional OTU. A window size of 1 bp with starting point 50. 50 bp gave similar dissimilarities. Although our results may require an improved binning technique to utilize the full biodiversity information in the profiles, the current T-RFLP technique clearly detected the biological variation in adjacent small sediment layers and can be used to characterize the microbial community in individual sediment layers. Eukaryotes offer and create a number of niches. The lugworm Arenicola marina is a bioturbator in marine intertidal sediments. The T-RFLP method was applied to investigate the bacterial community in the burrow of the lugworm A. marina. The U-shaped burrow is divided into three compartments: the vertical <b>head</b> <b>shaft</b> tube through which the surface sediment is sinking down and ingested by the lugworm, the horizontal gallery tube at where the lugworm relatively stays permanent inside the sediment and the vertical tail shaft tube through which the lugworm does defecation by moving backward until the tail reaches sediment surface and ejects characteristic fecal cast on the sediment surface. In the bulk sediment surrounding the U-shaped burrow, the sediment contained a number of different bacterial communities changing with depth. On the basis of an aerobic layer, a redox potential discontinuity (RDP) layer and an anoxic layer, the decreasing and the increasing TRFs over depth may represent surface and subsurface layer bacteria respectively at 0 - 2 cm and 2 - 10 cm depth. T-RFLP data suggested that the RDP layer is at 3 - 5 cm sediment depth, because the unique TRFs of the surface layer and subsurface layers were not found at this depth and the change of abundance of TRFs was fast. The T-RFLP analyses clearly grouped the microbial population in the <b>head</b> <b>shaft</b> tube with sediment surface populations. The tail shaft tube was populated by different populations; close to the surface dominated by the surface bacteria and below 3 cm dominated by the subsurface bacteria. The populations in the gallery tube were similar to those in the head and tail shaft tube. The richness in the gallery tube was the lowest but had the highest evenness. T-RFLP analyses of two mm-thick sediment layers from areas with A. marina and without A. marina also revealed a strong depth-dependence of the surface bacterial community composition. According to the T-RFLP analyses, {{the presence or absence of}} A. marina had no clear detectable influence on the microbial populations in the top two centimeter of sediment. Most likely, the increase presence of other burrowing animals in the A. marina exclusion areas seems to form highly similar biogeochemical environments for the development of bacterial communities...|$|E
40|$|Pile {{foundations}} {{are widely}} used, mainly to transmit structural load to an underlying stiffer soil or rock. This limit state load a certain pile can sustain without failure {{is known as}} pile ultimate bearing capacity. During design stage load-tests are performed in-situ on test piles to determine, among others, {{the value of the}} bearing capacity. Commonly static tests are performed as they provide the most reliable data. Dynamic tests are much more cost-effective but have a series of shortcomings, mainly the fact that they introduce stress-waves on the pile and that require calibration with the static values. To overcome both nature-kind problems, a new type of test in-between the previous ones, i. e. the pseudostatic test, has been developed. It is still a dynamic test but the loading pulse lasts longer (70 - 150 ms), 20 times the dynamic pulse, emphasizing the static component. Hence, it is both an economical and reliable option as requires no calibration with the static load-displacement curves. Therefore, it is interesting to get more insight on it. Two main factors can influence the bearing capacity of a pile measured on the in-situ tests, namely, loading rate and excess pore pressures. In cases like The Netherlands, where end-bearing piles are driven into saturated sand, these two concepts may play an important role. A previous study had been carried out in dry sand and did not find a remarkable loading rate effect. However, for the case of saturated sand the soil response remains unknown. This research investigates the topic, the objective is to get more insight on the excess pore pressure generation and dissipation, evaluate the static-pseudostatic correlation and investigate the possibility of providing effective predictive tools. The research has been structured in three parts. First a series of experimental scaled tests have been carried out for three loading rates: a CPT (20 mm/s), a static test (1 mm/s) and a pseudostatic test (up to 250 mm/s). The sample consisted in saturated sand that was prepared by means of a fluidizaton-vibration system. Standard sounding rots with a piezocone acted as the pile; five values were recorded: force on the pile <b>head,</b> <b>shaft</b> friction, tip resistance, displacement and acceleration. Later on, the performed scaled tests have been modeled analytically and numerically. An analytical model based on the cone model of Wolf has been developed. Only the soil underneath the pile tip is considered and it is modeled as an elastoplastic material under static fully undrained loading followed by consolidation. PLAXIS is the program used for the numerical model...|$|E
