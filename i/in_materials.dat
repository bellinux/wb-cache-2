40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on the system of {{assistance}} <b>in</b> <b>material</b> need and on the motivational elements of that system. The first part of the thesis defines basic concepts like poverty, material need, social security and system of assistance <b>in</b> <b>material</b> need and it informs about purpose of that system. The thesis then analyzes the method of assessing the state of material need and the individual benefits from the system of assistance <b>in</b> <b>material</b> need. <b>In</b> the analysis the elements further marked as motivational elements are described. Subsequently the thesis explains the addiction to benefits of assistance <b>in</b> <b>material</b> need and the sources of dependence on welfare benefits. In conclusion motivation elements of system of assistance <b>in</b> <b>material</b> need are demonstrated by comparing their stance before year 2012 with the year after and by comparing present motivation elements with sources of social welfare models...|$|R
5|$|Second-generation {{technologies}} include {{solar heating}} and cooling, wind power, modern forms of bioenergy, and solar photovoltaics. These are now entering markets {{as a result}} of research, development and demonstration (RD) investments since the 1980s. Initial investment was prompted by energy security concerns linked to the oil crises of the 1970s but the enduring appeal of these technologies is due, at least in part, to environmental benefits. Many of the technologies reflect significant advancements <b>in</b> <b>materials.</b>|$|E
5|$|A small {{fraction}} of the zircon is converted to the metal, which finds various niche applications. Because of zirconium's excellent resistance to corrosion, it is often used as an alloying agent <b>in</b> <b>materials</b> that are exposed to aggressive environments, such as surgical appliances, light filaments, and watch cases. The high reactivity of zirconium with oxygen at high temperatures is exploited in some specialised applications such as explosive primers and as getters in vacuum tubes. The same property is (probably) the purpose of including Zr nano-particles as pyrophoric material in explosive weapons such as the BLU-97/B Combined Effects Bomb.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} iron alloys, around 3kg (6.5lb) metspar {{is added to}} each metric ton of steel; the {{fluoride}} ions lower its melting point and viscosity. Alongside its role as an additive <b>in</b> <b>materials</b> like enamels and welding rod coats, most acidspar is reacted with sulfuric acid to form hydrofluoric acid, which is used in steel pickling, glass etching and alkane cracking. One-third of HF goes into synthesizing cryolite and aluminium trifluoride, both fluxes in the Hall–Héroult process for aluminium extraction; replenishment is necessitated by their occasional reactions with the smelting apparatus. Each metric ton of aluminium requires about 23kg (51lb) of flux. Fluorosilicates consume the second largest portion, with sodium fluorosilicate used in water fluoridation and laundry effluent treatment, and as an intermediate en route to cryolite and silicon tetrafluoride. Other important inorganic fluorides include those of cobalt, nickel, and ammonium.|$|E
5|$|Both of {{the country}} club's Route 9 entrances have a gatehouse. Both are small, two stories high, three bays wide, and one bay deep, and were {{constructed}} along with {{the house in the}} 1890s. The gatehouses resemble Woodlea <b>in</b> <b>materials</b> and simplified stylistic detail. Both gatehouses have gable roofs and a shed-roofed one-story high rear addition. The houses have stone and brick pedimented porticos over their entranceways. The lower-level windows have flat-arched surrounds with keystones; the oculi break the cornice lines beneath segmentally arched pediments. The northern gatehouse has another one-story rear addition and a small one-car garage. The club's two tall gateways are made of French-imported carved stone and ironwork.|$|E
5|$|Cracks are linear {{openings}} {{that form}} <b>in</b> <b>materials</b> to relieve stress. When an elastic material stretches or shrinks uniformly, it eventually reaches its breaking strength and then fails suddenly in all directions, creating cracks with 120 degree joints, so three cracks {{meet at a}} node. Conversely, when an inelastic material fails, straight cracks form to relieve the stress. Further stress {{in the same direction}} would then simply open the existing cracks; stress at right angles can create new cracks, at 90 degrees to the old ones. Thus the pattern of cracks indicates whether the material is elastic or not. In a tough fibrous material like oak tree bark, cracks form to relieve stress as usual, but they do not grow long as their growth is interrupted by bundles of strong elastic fibres. Since each species of tree has its own structure at the levels of cell and of molecules, each has its own pattern of splitting in its bark.|$|E

5|$|In 1574 {{the house}} was owned by George Perceval, the father of Richard Percivale {{who was born in}} the house and later deciphered Spanish {{documents}} for Queen Elizabeth about the Spanish Armada. Later owners in the 16th and 17th centuries included the local member of parliament Richard Cole and Nathaniel Wade who was condemned to death for his part in the Monmouth Rebellion. After 1795 a series of owners, who never lived in the house, leased it for use as a farmhouse and it fell into disrepair. In 1906 it was bought by Charles Edward Evans who undertook a major restoration project including bringing <b>in</b> <b>materials</b> from surrounding Tudor manors. After World War II it was converted into flats and in the 1990s into five private dwellings.|$|E

5|$|The company {{worked on}} tight profit margins {{immediately}} post-war. A {{combination of a}} shortage of skilled labour, outdated batch production methods and increasing costs <b>in</b> <b>materials</b> and payroll were matched by rising overhead, a shortage of materials and issues of absenteeism. The result was that despite a booming order book Redman was struggling to fulfil its commitments to customers, and gross margins on lathes were as low as 2.16%. The company {{was by no means}} unique in facing these difficulties but there was much urging, agonising and recriminating, by Gabriel and A K McKay, the Redman managing director since at least 1936, regarding {{how to deal with the}} issues. Some of this, perhaps inevitably as the war-time command economy reverted, was aimed at the government.|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} concerned {{in the social}} assistance system in the Czech Republic, concretely in the system of benefits of assistance <b>in</b> <b>material</b> need and typified cheques as the possible alternative of payment of these benefits. The theoretical part of the thesis is devoted to basic characteristics of the social assistance system in the Czech Republic, then more detailed to the system of benefits of assistance <b>in</b> <b>material</b> need itself, including description of cheques to buy goods and services, which can be engaged to pay out benefits of assistance <b>in</b> <b>material</b> need, and {{last but not least}} it is devoted to questions of substistence and living wages. The practical part is devoted to usage of these benefits in practice itself, concretely to payment of benefits of assistance <b>in</b> <b>material</b> need by the Municipality of Klatovy, the department of social affairs and health. My research is focused on the problem of cheques as the method of payment of benefits in practice, extend of usage of this payment method, {{not only in terms of}} payment of benefits of assistance <b>in</b> <b>material</b> need by the Municipality of Klatovy, but by the other regions of the Czech Republic as well...|$|R

As such, viruses are commonly used <b>in</b> <b>materials</b> science as scaffolds for covalently linked surface modifications. A particular quality of viruses is that they can be tailored by directed evolution. The powerful techniques developed by life sciences are becoming the basis of engineering approaches towards nanomaterials, opening a wide range of applications far beyond biology and medicine.|$|E
