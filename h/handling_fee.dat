5|$|The multi-coloured Personalised card is {{available}} on registration. The name and, if opted, {{a photo of the}} holder are imprinted on the cards. They can function automatically as a Child, Adult, or Elder card by recognising the cardholder's age stored on the card, hence accounting for different concessionary fares. As of 2003, there were 380,000 holders of Personalised Octopus cards. In addition to all the functions of an ordinary card, this card {{can be used as a}} key card for access to residential and office buildings. If a Personalised card is lost, the holder may report the loss by phone to prevent unauthorised use of the card. A refund would then be issued to the holder of the card for the deposit and the value that remained on the card three hours after the loss is reported, minus a HK$30 card cost and a HK$20 <b>handling</b> <b>fee.</b>|$|E

A Personalised On-Loan card or an anonymous On-Loan card with more than HK$500 stored on it needs to be sent back to Octopus Cards Limited for refund processing, in which case, the refund for a Personalised On-Loan card would be available in eight days, and that of an anonymous On-Loan card would be available in five days. If a damaged card is returned for refund, a HK$30 levy would be charged to the cardholder.|$|E

50|$|Mid-stream {{operation}} involves {{loading and}} unloading containers to and from ships while at sea, with barges or dumb steel lighters performing the transfer, and then distributing or landing the containers to piers nearby.

50|$|BAA {{has since}} {{taken steps to}} improve this issue, {{including}} the waiving of mandatory <b>handling</b> <b>fees</b> for light aircraft at Aberdeen and Southampton. In 2014, the equivalent charges were: £29.65 at Southampton and £64.63 at Aberdeen. However the fees remained the same at Glasgow.

50|$|While the {{proposed}} {{expansion of the}} bottle bill includes provisions for both deposits paid by consumers as well as <b>handling</b> <b>fees</b> paid by industry, a portion of deposits paid are expected to remain unredeemed.

Under {{the proposed}} ballot initiative, the forfeited deposits would be directed to environmental programs.|$|R
5|$|Regional airports, such as Edinburgh Airport, have {{experienced}} strong growth in CAT operations in recent years. These operations are commercially and operationally incompatible with GA, {{and although there}} is no evidence of deliberate discrimination, the effect has been to discourage or exclude it. GA aircraft are being subject to significant increases in charges, including the imposition of <b>handling</b> <b>fees</b> in some cases. Some airports restrict or deny GA parking, and others limit or refuse certain GA activity. As a result, light GA aircraft are now rarely or never seen at large, busy international airports such as Heathrow, Stansted, Gatwick and Manchester.|$|R
50|$|A {{referendum}} {{on the ballot in}} November 2014, concerned whether to expand the bill to cover containers for some non-carbonated beverages. This would address growing concern over the nearly 1.4billion containers not covered by existing legislation that are found in litter and landfill waste. The goal of the initiative petition that placed the measure on the ballot was to broaden the scope of beverage types requiring a deposit in order to be more responsive to consumer preferences as well as establishing a mechanism for stabilizing the recycling industry by tying the <b>handling</b> <b>fees</b> paid to redemption centers to the Consumer Price Index. Opponents argued that the change would increase costs and red tape for the beverage industry.|$|R
50|$|Some scammers will {{go after}} the victims of {{previous}} scams; known as a reloading scam.

5000|$|It {{was found}} that The Point - a social {{initiatives}} platform whose name was inspired by Malcolm Gladwell's The Tipping Point - was too abstract to market, and it was stripped down to the Groupon concept, a website that sells deals to local businesses.

5000|$|Jackson called {{attention}} to American Airlines' newly imposed luggage <b>handling</b> <b>fees</b> for even the first checked bag. She claimed that the fees were contrary to Section 26-04 of the Airport Use Agreement with the City of Chicago, which is the contract that permits American Airlines to be a carrier in Chicago airports. The initial plan exempted Platinum and Executive card holders who were generally business travelers and placed an inordinate burden of new fees on the common traveler in contravention of the non-discriminatory price agreement in the agreement. She expressed interest in a City Council forum on the issue. [...] She wrote directly to American Airlines and then wrote {{an article in the}} Chicago Sun-Times on the issue.|$|R
5000|$|In mid-1942 the Springfield Ordnance District (SOD) {{was given}} control over {{procurement}} {{and distribution of}} the Commando, which transferred the revolvers to the end user. A few Commandos were shipped to the U.S. Maritime Commission and used as small arms equipment on U.S. merchant ships and ships provided to the Allies under Lend-Lease. [...] Most Commando wartime production went to the Defense Supplies Corporation (DSC). for use by security and police forces, while approximately 1,800 Commandos were used by the U.S. Navy, with another 12,800 revolvers distributed to various military intelligence agencies. Control over procurement changed in 1944, after the DSC formally objected to being charged additional <b>handling</b> <b>fees</b> by the armed forces, and was then authorized to procure the Commando directly from Colt.|$|R
5000|$|In March 2009, Lufthansa {{said that}} it saw a {{competitive}} imbalance between Emirates and itself in the Germany-Dubai air travel market, effectively accusing the UAE carrier of stealing its transfer passengers between North America, the Middle East, Africa, India and the Far East. It also alleged that there were material differences in <b>handling</b> <b>fees</b> at Dubai Airport and unequal opportunities for the two airlines in each other's home markets. The latter relates to Emirates' heavy reliance on so-called [...] "sixth freedom" [...] traffic rights that enable it to carry passengers, cargo and mail between Germany and third countries via its hub in Dubai to fill most of the space on its Germany-Dubai flights, {{as a result of}} there being insufficient origin and destination traffic.|$|R
