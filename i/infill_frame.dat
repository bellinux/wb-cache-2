40|$|Unreinforced masonry in fills {{has long}} been known to affect the {{strength}} and stiffness of frame. Under the action of a lateral load the principal compressive diagonal acts as a strut or bracing and increases the initial lateral stiffness of the framed structure. However, in the presence of openings in walls, which is more practical, the behavior of infill changes. The primary objective {{of this paper is to}} study the variation of lateral stiffness, principal compressive diagonal strut width with modulus of masonry infill, with and without openings. In the study a non-linear (multi-linear) analysis is performed, since it is more realistic. From the analysis performed using ANSYS Version 10. 0 it is seen that linear analysis over-estimates the lateral stiffness of the <b>infill</b> <b>frame.</b> Further, it is observed that the width of compressive diagonal generally decreases with increase in the modulus of masonry. It is also seen that incase of two frames with equal area of openings, the frame with larger width of opening exhibits slightly more initial lateral stiffness due to possibility of formation of single diagonal strut...|$|E

40|$|RC framed {{buildings}} are generally designed without considering the structural action of masonry infill walls. These masonry infill walls {{are widely used}} as partitions and considered as non-structural elements. But they affect both the structural and non-structural performance of RC buildings during earthquake. RC framed building with open ground storey is known as soft storey, which performs poorly during earthquake. In order to study this total 144 RC framed buildings having bare frame, full <b>infill</b> <b>frame</b> and open ground storey frame were analyzed by seismic coefficient method and response spectrum method for various seismic hazards.

40|$|Observations {{were made}} of the {{behavior}} of masonry infills in structural frames during the Northridge earthquake, and an analytical technique was developed for analyzing infilled frame structures. Infills near the epicenter suffered significant damage, but in several cases contributed to the seismic resistance and life safety performance. Older infill buildings in downtown Los Angeles experienced intensity of shaking similar to that expected in central/eastern United States earthquakes. The infills experienced some cracking, but otherwise complemented the lateral resistance of the weak building frames. This suggests <b>infill</b> <b>frame</b> buildings in moderate seismic zones may provide at least life safety functions without the need for expensive retrofit. A developed analytical technique was used to analyze two buildings for which the observed behavior and records from the Northridge earthquake were available. The analytical technique was based on using a piecewise linear equivalent strut for the infill. Parameters for the strut were obtained by examining the results {{of a wide variety of}} experimental infill tests. The strut method is easy to incorporate in standard linear analyses, and converges quite rapidly. The strut method was applied to two structures that had records from the Northridge earthquake.

30|$|This {{work was}} {{inspired}} by the study that the authors carried out within the Italian RINTC project (RINTC Workgroup 2018), a multi-year research initiative, whose aim is to assess the risk of collapse of code-conforming buildings designed according to the Italian Building Code NTC 2008. The RINTC project deals with reinforced concrete, precast reinforced concrete, masonry, steel, and base-isolated structures. The present work focuses on assessing collapse of cast-in-place reinforced concrete buildings. Only residential buildings are considered. The definition of building collapse is not unique (Villaverde 2007). Different codes and different authors have not converged to similar approaches to define collapse. In a performance framework, collapse can be defined as the inability of the structures to guarantee a given performance for a given earthquake. At collapse, a structures loses its capability to carry lateral loads. Collapse can be assessed through either local or global engineering demand parameters (EPDs) at the local (element) or global level (Whittaker et al. 2004). Local EDPs typically re. Collapse depends on a number of factors, all affected by the cyclic response of the structure to a given earthquake. This work compares different collapse definitions available in building codes (EC 8, NTC 2008), design guidelines (FEMA 356, SEAOC Vision 2000), and published literature (Camata et al. 2017; Ghobarah 2004). The comparison between the different definitions is carried out by analyzing two different code-conforming RC buildings (a six and a nine-story building) in three different configurations: Bare Frame (BF), <b>Infill</b> <b>Frame</b> (IF), and Pilotis Frame (PF).|$|E

40|$|Masonry {{is a major}} infill {{material}} {{which is}} used in RC frames throughout the world; we have accepted that the masonry increases the stiffness of structure. The vertical live load and dead loads due to masonry do not pose much of problems to the RC frame {{in the absence of}} lateral forces of wind or earthquake, but concentrated masses of masonry accelerates the lateral forces during the affect of wind forces and earthquake forces. The frame exhibits diagonal crack failure at brick infill at a relatively slow rate of increase before they started to break down.

40|$|The Secant Method is an {{iterative}} method {{in which the}} peak displacement response of a structure or structural component is determined from linear dynamic analyses of a model whose stiffness is updated to reflect a computed degree of degradation {{that is consistent with}} the computed peak displacement. Numerous descriptions of the Secant Method and related procedures exist in the literature. Division 95 of the City of Los Angeles Building Code, for example, includes a formulation of the Secant Method that is specifically intended for evaluation and rehabilitation of <b>infill</b> <b>frame</b> buildings with limited ductility. In the Secant Method, the degree of degradation of a structure is derived from the secant as determined from nonlinear force-displacement relationships for the structure as a whole or from appropriate sub-assemblies and this information is substituted into the linear dynamic analysis environment. In this way, the dynamic analysis model is updated to approximate intermediate states of degradation until a rational and consistent convergence in each sub-assembly as well as the whole structure is achieved. The Secant Method can be unwieldy, however, when applied to multistory complex structures, due to the involvement of a number of modes in their dynamic response and due to the requirement that convergence be achieved for the system as a whole and for its various sub-assemblies. In this paper, we explain the basic Secant Method, apply it to complex multi-story buildings, and describe an iterative routine that facilitates capturing higher mod...|$|E

This paper deals with different classes of reinforced concrete buildings (namely 3 -, 6 - and 9 - story high moment resisting frame) designed in cities with increasing seismic hazard. For the sake of brevity, only the results of 6 -story buildings are reported. First, the paper describes the geometry, material characteristics and main design properties of the buildings, including their elastic dynamic properties.

Since the buildings are designed according to capacity design principles, the nonlinear behaviors of beams and columns in shear and of beam-column joints are not considered.

It is now widely recognised that masonry infill panels, used in reinforced concrete (R/C) frame structures, significantly enhance both the stiffness and the strength of the surrounding frame.
