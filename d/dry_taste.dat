The popular {{notion of}} humor, {{considered}} as index to the heart, would seem curiously confirmed by Aristotle--I think, in his 'Politics,' (a work, by-the-by, which, however {{it may be}} viewed upon the whole, yet, from the tenor of certain sections, should not, without precaution, {{be placed in the}} hands of youth)--who remarks that the least lovable men in history seem to have had for humor not only a disrelish, but a hatred; and this, in some cases, along with an extraordinary <b>dry</b> <b>taste</b> for practical punning.

50|$|How sweet a wine will {{taste is}} also {{controlled}} by {{factors such as}} the acidity and alcohol levels, the amount of tannin present, and whether the wine is sparkling or not. A sweet wine such as a Vouvray can actually <b>taste</b> <b>dry</b> due to the high level of acidity. A <b>dry</b> wine can <b>taste</b> sweet if the alcohol level is elevated. Medium and sweet wines have a perception among many consumers of being of lower quality than dry wines. However, many of the world's great wines, such as those from Sauternes (including Barsac) or Tokaj, have a high level of residual sugar, which is carefully balanced with additional acidity to produce a harmonious result.|$|R

40|$|Ever {{wondered}} if <b>dried</b> fruits <b>taste</b> twice as nice when exported? Well, several African companies are happily finding sweet {{success on the}} world s markets and are pushing ahead with production. One Togolese firm, Safleg, itself {{a member of the}} Fadoul trading group, markets dried pineapple rings, chunks and pieces, and sells them, under an organic label, exclusively on the German market. It processes 22 tonnes of fresh pineapple each week, and is moving into new markets with dried mangoes and bananas. In Guinea, Nabekam-Bio exports dried organic pineapples, mangoes and bananas to France. Its export volume, a mere 20 tonnes each year, is far below the requirements of the importer who currently handles 1, 000 tonnes annually; Nabekam-Bio aim to expand their drying plant and to triple production. On a larger scale, the Ivoirian Desiccated Coconut Company (SICOR, of the AfricIndustry group) is the leading African company in this sector and exports all its 13, 000 tonnes of annual production representing 6 % of the world market to high-profile European processors such as Mars and Ferrero. The company s 13, 000 hectares of plantations have, for the time being, missed out on the dreaded 'Cap Saint-Paul' disease which is afflicting neighbouring countries. Their desiccated coconut, the product of drying, crushing and sifting the copra, is highly valued for its quality (it is very white) and its freshness which, unlike Asian exports, is not affected by excessively long shipping.

50|$|In the {{alcoholic}} drinks industry, congeners are substances produced during fermentation. These substances include {{small amounts of}} chemicals such as occasionally desired other alcohols, like propanol and 3-methyl-1-butanol, but also compounds that are never desired such as acetone, acetaldehyde and glycols. Congeners are {{responsible for most of}} the taste and aroma of distilled alcoholic drinks, and contribute to the taste of non-distilled drinks. It has been suggested that these substances contribute to the symptoms of a hangover. Tannins are congeners found in wine in the presence of phenolic compounds.
