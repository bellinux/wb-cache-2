40|$|Background. In the {{environment}} of engineering knowledge portals great amount of partial workflows is concentrated. Such workflows are composed into general workflow aiming to perform real complex production task. Characteristics of partial workflows and general workflow structure are not studied enough, that affects the impossibility of <b>general</b> <b>production</b> workflow dynamic composition. Objective. Creating an approach to the <b>general</b> <b>production</b> workflow dynamic composition based on the partial workflows meta-descriptions comparison on engineering knowledge portals. Methods. Analysis of the partial parameters workflow and characteristics {{and the structure of}} <b>general</b> <b>production</b> workflow of knowledge portals made it possible to specify rules for partial workflows inclusion into <b>general</b> <b>production</b> workflow (based on workflows meta-descriptions comparison), to design algebraic model of <b>general</b> <b>production</b> workflow and develop the production workflow tree forming method. Results. Experimental investigation was made on the application of suggested approach to <b>general</b> <b>production</b> workflow dynamic composition for real complex production workflow of engineering knowledge portal ?Calculation of the strength for the power components of magnetic systems?. Conclusions. The approach to the <b>general</b> <b>production</b> workflow dynamic composition on engineering knowledge portals is suggested, that allows, based on comparison of the partial workflows meta-descriptions values, choosing from their set workflows that are required to perform real complex workflow. ????????????. ? ????? ?????????? ???????? ?????? ????????????? ??????? ?????????? ????????? ??????? ?????????, ??????? ???????????? ? ????? ??????? ??????? ? ????? ?????????? ???????? ??????????? ???????????????? ????????? ??????. ?????????????? ????? ????????? ??????? ????????? ? ????????? ????? ????????? ???????????? ???????????, ??? ?????? ?? ????????????? ????????????? ???????????? ?????? ????????????????? ????????. ???? ????????????. ???????? ??????? ? ????????????? ???????????? ?????? ????????????????? ???????? ???????? ?? ????????? ????????? ???????????? ????????? ??????? ????????? ?????????? ???????? ??????. ???????? ??????????. ?????? ?????????? ? ????????????? ????????? ??????? ?????????, ? ????? ????????? ????? ???????????????? ??????? ????????? ???????? ?????? ??? ??????????? ?????? ??????? ????????? ????????? ??????? ????????? ? ????? ???????????????? ??????? ????????

40|$|Qualified {{management}} {{aimed at}} optimizing financial results {{is the key}} factor in today's society. Effective management decisions depend on the necessary information about the costs of production process in all its aspects – their structure, types, accounting policies of reflecting costs. <b>General</b> <b>production</b> costs, the so-called indirect costs that are {{not directly related to}} the production process, but provide its functioning in terms of supporting structural divisions and create the necessary conditions of production, {{play a significant role in}} calculating prime costs of goods (works, services). However, the accurate estimate of prime costs of goods (works, services) should be determined with the value of indirect costs (in other words, <b>general</b> <b>production</b> costs), and properly determined with the base of their allocation. The choice of allocation base of <b>general</b> <b>production</b> costs is the significant moment, depending on the nature of business, which must guarantee fair distribution regarding to the largest share of direct expenses in the total structure of production costs. The study finds the essence of <b>general</b> <b>production</b> costs based on the analysis of key definitions of leading Ukrainian economists. The optimal allocation approach of <b>general</b> <b>production</b> costs is to calculate these costs as direct production costs within each subsidiary division (department) separately without selecting a base as the main one to the their total amount. ...|$|R

Roemer's program was then to propose definitions of embodied labor time, for economies with more <b>general</b> <b>production</b> sets, which would preserve the CECP. This led to the observation that, for <b>general</b> <b>production</b> sets, embodied labor time cannot be defined before one knows equilibrium prices. Thus, contrary to Marx, labor value is not a concept which is more fundamental than prices.|$|R

Finally, we present a computer implementation of production machines {{and use it to}} produce some sample output from grammars of English, French and a translation grammar of English and French. 1 Introduction It is well-known that a simple pushdown automaton can be used to generate and recognize sentences in a language with a context-free grammar [ASU 86]. For <b>general</b> <b>production</b> grammars, the matter is slightly more involved. A machine corresponding roughly to a double pushdown automaton was used by Lambek [Lam 93] to generate and recognize sentences in a language with a <b>general</b> <b>production</b> grammar. We provide in this paper a correctness proof for such a production machine. We show a sentence can be generated (or recognized) by a pro [...] ...|$|R

The latter extends the microfoundations for the standard market utility assumption used in competitive search models with a continuum of agents to new environments. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{effort has been}} made to unveil some hidden and {{implicit}} assumptions that has been used in different models dealing with analysis and measurement of contribution of human capital to economic growth. We start from <b>general</b> <b>production</b> function with heterogeneous labor input and <b>general</b> <b>production</b> function with heterogeneous human and physical capital. By introducing different assumptions regarding partial elasticity of substitution between different factors of production we derived different models for human capital contribution. Apart from making hidden assumptions of existing models explicit, we also derived dozen of others models {{that can be used for}} same purposes. Among those newly proposed models especially important are those that are derived from <b>general</b> <b>production</b> function with heterogeneous human capital and that are based on assumption of unlimited partial elasticity of substitution between different kinds of human capital. First, they allow for more detailed sources of growth analysis. Second, they do not have any problem with wage premium increase experienced in last three decade, which make problematic usage of most of other models used so far...|$|R
