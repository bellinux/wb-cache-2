25|$|One {{week before}} Gacy's wedding, on June 22, {{he was arrested}} and charged with aggravated battery and {{reckless}} conduct. The arrest was in response to a complaint filed by a youth named Jackie Dee, who informed police that Gacy, impersonating a police officer, had <b>flashed</b> <b>a</b> sheriff's badge, lured him into his car, and forced him to perform oral sex. These charges were later dropped after the complainant attempted to blackmail Gacy into paying money in exchange for dropping the charges.|$|E
25|$|Castro {{was sent}} to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. The top half of his right index finger was ripped off and the doctors had to amputate the {{remaining}} part of the finger. His right eye was blown out and he had a metal fragment in his left eye. The extent of his injuries was such that doctors doubted whether Castro would survive the week. When Castro regained consciousness days later, his right eye was gone, but doctors hoped to salvage the vision in his left. The surgeons later removed one last piece of shrapnel from that eye. When they took off his bandages they <b>flashed</b> <b>a</b> light for Castro to see; however, when he did not respond to the light, he was told that he would never see again. Castro remained in the hospital for two months after his injury, with no idea of what he would do next. He then overheard a doctor and a nurse discussing the next Army Ten-Miler and the Marine Corps Marathon. He asked his doctor if the courses were flat or hilly, then made running both races his goal.|$|E
25|$|The two Indians {{continued}} to torment the Australians, with some risk-free but effective strokeplay, which fetched them boundaries. The {{only time in}} which the partnership saw an unorthodox shot was when Dravid dispatched a Stuart MacGill ball straight back over the bowler's head for a four by lashing at it hard and straight in the 106th over, when India were at 340/4. 4.4 overs later, Dravid's wristy flick off his hips brought him his 150, his seventh score of 150+ in tests at that time. Then, just when it seemed that Australia had to resign themselves to a long day, at 376/4 from 112.4 overs Laxman <b>flashed</b> <b>a</b> short and slightly wide delivery from Andy Bichel towards slips, where Ricky Ponting could not {{get his hands on}} the ball, and it went away through third man for a four. Later, when the score stood at 384/4, and the partnership was already 299, Laxman produced a classical drive with good timing, and good placement through extra cover to bring up the 300 for the partnership off 563 balls. As a respite for the Australians, on the last ball before tea, Laxman again decide to cut a good, rising delivery from Bichel, but managed to get an edge to Gilchrist, who had to stretch a little to take an impressive catch.|$|E

500|$|Having {{won their}} first divisional title in 23 years, the Giants hosted the 49ers in the Divisional Playoffs and won easily, 49-3.

The jars contained letters leading to the I Love Bees website and a countdown.

A {{policeman}} stopped to question the rapper, who dropped the coat, <b>flashed</b> <b>a</b> handgun and ran away. Officers chased then 16-year-old Keef, who turned around several times and pointed the gun at them. The policemen [...] "discharged their weapons," [...] but missed. They caught him a half-block later and recovered the pistol, which was loaded. Keef was charged with three counts of aggravated assault with a firearm on a police officer and aggravated unlawful use of a weapon. He was also given a misdemeanor charge for resisting arrest. He was held in the Cook County Juvenile Detention Center until a judge sentenced him to home confinement at his grandmother’s house.|$|E

Shortly afterwards, on 7 April, the units of I Anzac Corps {{were assigned to}} a [...] "quiet" [...] sector of the line near Armentières to gain experience of trench warfare. Due to concerns about a German attack, almost immediately the Australians set to work to improve the defences around their position. It had been hoped by the high command to initially keep the Australian presence a secret {{in order to gain}} some advantage from it, however, on 23 April it became apparent that the Germans had become aware of their arrival when a signal lamp <b>flashed</b> <b>a</b> message in Morse code from the trench opposite the 2nd Battalion's position stating, [...] "Australians go home". To this, the Australians, despite orders against responding, replied matter-of-factly, [...] "Why?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The Streif {{was sent}} {{out on a}} mission to Trøndelag, with an agent and supplies. The crew were that of the Harald, which had an engine failure. They went out with no navigator, because he had fallen ill, and there was no other available. The voyage to Norway went well, but on their return, the engine stopped, and they started drifting. After some days they managed to start the engine again, but they had no idea [...] where they were. One day they saw a British plane, and <b>flashed</b> <b>a</b> signal. The plane turned eastward, and they {{believed}} that they were west of Shetland, and steered south, as they were bound for Peterhead.|$|E
2500|$|Faith Cole MacLean and her husband, actor Douglas MacLean, were Taylor's neighbors, and Faith {{is widely}} {{believed}} to have seen Taylor's killer. The couple was startled by a loud noise at 8pm.

She recalled this person paused for a moment before turning and walking back through the door, as if having forgotten something, then re-emerged and <b>flashed</b> <b>a</b> smile at her before disappearing between the buildings. MacLean decided she had heard a car back-fire. She also told police interviewers this person looked [...] "funny" [...] (like movie actors in makeup) and may have been a woman disguised as a man.|$|E

2500|$|Lampard's 2007–08 {{season was}} {{hampered}} by injury. He managed to play 40 matches, 24 {{of them in}} the Premier League. This was the fewest number of league games he had played in a season since 1996–97. On 16 February 2008, Lampard became the eighth Chelsea player to score 100 goals for the club in a 3–1 FA Cup fifth-round win over Huddersfield Town. After the final whistle, Lampard removed his jersey and <b>flashed</b> <b>a</b> T-shirt to the Chelsea fans with [...] "100 Not Out, They Are All For You, Thanks" [...] printed across the front. On 12 March 2008, Lampard scored four goals in a 6–1 rout of Derby County.

2500|$|Chadwick {{wrote that}} Pius XII met {{personally}} with D'Arcy Osborne, {{telling him that}} he knew {{the names of the}} involved German generals but did not wish to share them. Pius XII insisted to Osborne that he was merely passing on a message and that [...] "he did not wish in the slightest degree to endorse it or to recommend it". When Osborne pressed the Pope on the vagueness of his message, Osborne reported that Pius XII replied [...] "perhaps, after all, it was not worth proceeding with the matter and he would therefore ask me to return his communication to me as not having been made". The Pope further declined Osborne's request to guarantee the good faith of the generals, or whether they could accomplish their goal. In a second meeting, Pius XII <b>flashed</b> <b>a</b> typed, four-page letter in German in front of Osborne, but declined to let him read it or have a copy.|$|E
2500|$|At midnight {{the group}} reached the {{riverbank}} {{and moved to}} the crossing point indicated by the Bofors tracer fire. [...] Once there they <b>flashed</b> <b>a</b> [...] signal with their torches, but there was an anxious wait of twenty minutes for the boats. [...] In fact, on the south bank Dobie, the engineers and a patrol of E Company, 506 PIR observed the signal and immediately launched their boats, but the British were some 500-800m upriver of the crossing point. [...] Upon reaching the north bank E Company established a small perimeter while men headed east to locate the evaders. [...] The men quickly moved downstream and in the next 90 minutes all of them were evacuated, {{with the exception of a}} Russian who was caught and arrested by the Germans. [...] The Germans opened fire sporadically and some mortar rounds fell near the crossing, but the fire was inaccurate. [...] Once on the other side the escapees were led to a farmhouse for refreshments, before being driven to Nijmegen where Dobie had arranged a party and champagne. [...] The men were later flown back to the UK, rejoining the men who had escaped in Operation Berlin.|$|E

Hollis, {{not sure if it}} was a prank or if he had been mistaken for someone else, told the man, [...] "Fellow, you've got me mixed up with someone else. You've got the wrong man." [...] The man had a pistol and told him something like, [...] "I don't want to kill you fellow, so do what I say", and ordered them {{to get out of the}} car. They both got out through the driver-side door. The man told Hollis to [...] "take off your [...] britches." [...] Larey pleaded with Hollis to please take them off, believing that if he did they would not be hurt, but, after Hollis removed his trousers, he was struck twice in the head with a heavy, blunt object. Larey explained in an interview three months later with Texarkana Gazette reporter Lucille Holland that the noise was so loud she thought he had been shot, but she learned later it was the sound of his skull cracking.|$|E
2500|$|Supply ships Uckermark and Ermland signalled {{they had}} sighted another convoy. They acted as shepherds as they rushed at the startled merchantmen and drove {{them toward the}} German battleships. On 15 March Lütjens began his attack. Empire of Industry (formerly German), Mangkai (formerly the German Scheer), Silverfix, Demerton, Grandi, Royal Crown, Sardinian Prince and the French Myson were sunk. Among the company was Chilean Reefer. Only 1,800 tons, the ship made smoke and {{returned}} Gniesenaus fire. Believing it possibly disguised as an enemy cruiser, or a scout, the Germans withdrew to a safe distance and sank it with the main batteries. It was a small target which took 73 rounds to destroy. HMS Rodney appeared 15 minutes later and <b>flashed</b> <b>a</b> challenge. In Lütjens' mind, it confirmed his suspicions of the vessel as a scout. Lütjens identified Gneisenau as [...] "HMS Emerald", buying time as he worked up to escape. It worked, and Rodney stayed {{to pick up the}} survivors from the Chilean Reefer. After transferring 200 prisoners, he set course for Brest, France. Sighted by an aircraft from [...] on 20 March, Admiral Lütjens managed to evade British warships, and reached Brest at 07:00 on 22 March.

2500|$|Meanwhile, Jim Kaat earned {{rave reviews}} {{for his role}} as CBS' backup analyst (which <b>flashed</b> <b>a</b> {{considerable}} [...] "good-guy air"). Ron Bergman wrote of Kaat's performance during the 1990 ALCS, [...] "This was a night for pitchers to excel. Dave Stewart. Roger Clemens. Jim Kaat [...]" [...] Despite the rave reviews, Jim Kaat admitted that he was frustrated. He felt that at that point and time, the idea of figuring out what to talk about during a three-hour broadcast had become intimidating. As a result, Kaat would bring notes into the booth, but in the process, found himself providing too much detail. He ultimately confided in his broadcasting partner, Dick Stockton, that he wanted to work without notes. So Stockton hooked Kaat up with then-lead NFL on CBS color commentator, John Madden for a telephone seminar. Madden said if he brought notes into the booth he felt compelled to use them and would [...] "force" [...] something into a telecast. On his seminar with John Madden, Jim Kaat said [...] "Then John told me if he did his homework it would be stored in his memory bank. And if it is important it will come out. If it doesn't, it probably wasn't that important." ...|$|E
