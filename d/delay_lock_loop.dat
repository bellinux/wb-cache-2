40|$|No {{matter which}} form of spread {{spectrum}} technique we employ, {{we need to}} have the timing infor-mation of the transmitted signal in order to despread the received signal and demodulate the despread signal. For a DS-SS system, we see from the discussions in Chapters 2 and 3 that if we are off even by a single chip duration, we will be unable to despread the received spread spectrum signal, since the spread sequence is designed to have a small out-of-phase autocorrelation magnitude. Therefore, the process of acquiring the timing information of the transmitted spread spectrum signal is essential to the implementation of any form of spread spectrum technique. Usually the problem of timing acquisition is solved via a two-step approach: ¯ Initial code acquisition (coarse acquisition or coarse synchronization) which synchronizes the transmitter and receiver to within an uncertainty of ¦Ì ¯ Code tracking which performs and maintains fine synchronization between the transmitter and receiver.
