40|$|We {{conducted}} modeling work in {{radiative transfer}} and cloud microphysics. Our work in radiative transfer included performance tests to other high accuracy methods and to measurements under cloudy, partial cloudy and cloud-free conditions. Our modeling {{efforts have been}} aimed to (1) develop an accurate and rapid radiative transfer model; (2) develop three-dimensional radiative transfer models; and (3) develop microphysics resolving cloud and aerosol models. We applied our models to <b>investigate</b> solar clear-sky model biases, <b>investigate</b> aerosol direct effects, <b>investigate</b> aerosol indirect effects, <b>investigate</b> microphysical properties of cirrus, <b>investigate</b> microphysical properties of stratus, <b>investigate</b> relationships between cloud properties, and <b>investigate</b> the effects of cloud structure...|$|R
