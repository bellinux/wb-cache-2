40|$|Packaging {{has always}} {{received}} a lot of attention within the field of design for sustainability. The classical approach has been to mainly focus on reducing the impact of the packaging. This approach stems from the ill-informed position that packaging is superfluous, or at best there only for marketing reasons. This is a rather guild-based approach that, if taken to extremes, would lead to complete elimination of packaging, or at most a quintessential brown paper bag. In industry reality though, the packaging design is seen as a way to differentiate, to stand out from the competition. That view is at odds with the sustainability view. Also, through fulfilling its other functions, such as protection of the packed product, packaging contributes to sustainability. This paper discusses several other approaches, such as circular economy as an alternative perspective on sustainability, prevention of food waste as an alternative design priority, and the eco-cost value ratio as an alternative assessment method. Subsequently, the alternative assessment method, the so-called eco-costs/value ratio, or EVR, is elaborated upon. By comparing the eco-burden of a packaging with the value created, it allows aligning sustainability and marketing performance. Hence, it shows an approach to design for sustainability that is more in line with business reality. In this paper several packaging examples are used, but this method is applicable for all sorts of <b>designs,</b> such as <b>furniture</b> <b>design</b> and <b>service</b> <b>design,</b> as will be briefly discussed as well.

40|$|<b>Furniture</b> <b>design</b> for the {{increasing}} plus-size population {{emerges as a}} challenge for the U. S. furniture industry. Furniture manufacturers need to design and produce more products for this market. Design guidelines and methodology are needed for <b>designing</b> plus-size <b>furniture</b> that could potentially become products for mass production. ^ This study summarized plus-size furniture guidelines and generated a comprehensive <b>furniture</b> <b>design</b> methodology that integrates functional design, strength design, design for manufacturing. This <b>furniture</b> <b>design</b> methodology was validated by mean of {{a case study of}} plus-size <b>furniture</b> <b>design,</b> construction, and manufacturing. The case study yielded a plus-size rocking chair design with durable structure, sound functions, and low cost that was feasible to manufacture. The study explored the frameworks for plus-size <b>furniture</b> <b>design</b> and emphasized the functional design, strength design and design for manufacturing as parts of the methodology. It also involved discussing how strength design and design for manufacturing worked as design tools to optimize the design process, which could be meaningful for <b>furniture</b> <b>design</b> education. ...|$|R
