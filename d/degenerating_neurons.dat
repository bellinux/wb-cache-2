50|$|Fluoro-Jade stain is a {{fluorochrome}} {{derived from}} fluorescein, and {{is commonly used}} in neuroscience disciplines to label <b>degenerating</b> <b>neurons</b> in ex vivo tissue of the central nervous system. The first fluoro-jade derivative was reported by Larry Schmued in 1997 as an alternative method from traditional methods for labeling <b>degenerating</b> <b>neurons</b> such as silver degeneration stains, H&E stain, or Nissl stain. Fluoro-Jade may be preferred to other degenerative stains due to simplicity of staining procedures and visual interpretation, which are common drawbacks of conventional degenerative stains. However, the mechanism by which fluoro-jade labels <b>degenerating</b> <b>neurons</b> is unknown thus creating some controversy to the actual physiological condition of the labeled cells.|$|E

Additionally, a positive control is included to ensure validity of staining procedures; to show that <b>degenerating</b> <b>neurons</b> will be stained with fluoro-jade. An acceptable positive control includes neurodegenerative tissue from subjects where fluoro-jade has already been validated, such as kainic acid treated animals.|$|E

Despite well known that carotidbodies have an {{important}} role in cerebral circulation andblood pH regulation, their roles has not been investigatedin subarachnoid haemorrhage. We investigated whetherthere is neuroprotective effect of neuron density of carotidbodies on the brain in subarachnoid haemorrhage. Methods: Twenty hybrid rabbits were studied. Four ofthem were used as reference group (n= 4) and the remainingwas obliged to subarachnoid haemorrhage by injectingautologous blood into their cisterna magna (n= 16) and sacrificed after one month. All carotid bodies andbrains examined histopathologically using by stereologicmethods. The relationship between the neuronal densityof carotid body and <b>degenerated</b> <b>neuron</b> density of thehippocampus were compared statistically. Results: Five rabbits with subarachnoid haemorrhagedead during the follow-up time (n= 5). The average neuronaldensity of carotid body was 4500 ± 500 cells/mm 3 and of hippocampus 170. 000 ± 17. 000 cell/mm 3 in normalrabbit family. The <b>degenerated</b> <b>neuron</b> density ofthe hippocampus was 20. 000 ± 3. 000 cells/mm 3 in rabbitswith have high neuron density of carotid body and was 65. 000 ± 8. 000 cells/mm 3 in rabbits with low neuron densityof carotid body.

As {{a first step in}} clarifying its pathogenesis, we examined the distribution of viral RNA in the spinal cord using in situ hybridization. At 3 days post inoculation (DPI), in the spinal cord of mice showing slight paralysis, viral RNA was observed in capillary endothelial cells and a few adjacent glia cells in the funiculus lateralis from thoracic to lumbar enlargement. At 7 DPI, in the spinal cord of mice showing apparent paralysis, viral RNA was observed in a larger number of glia cells in the demyelinated lesion associated with infiltration of macrophages in the funiculus lateralis and in a small number of <b>degenerated</b> <b>neurons</b> in the cornu ventrale. In the funiculus lateralis, viral RNA could not be observed after 28 DPI. On the other hand, viral RNA was observed in <b>degenerated</b> <b>neurons</b> in the cornu ventrale of mice showing the second phase paralysis at 42 DPI. Many CD 4 +T cells infiltrated around these <b>degenerated</b> <b>neurons.</b> These results suggest that: (1) the viral entry zone was the capillary endothelial cells in the funiculus lateralis; (2) first phase paralysis was due to demyelination caused by EMC-D and associated with macrophage infiltration; (3) second phase paralysis was due to degeneration of motor neurons bearing viral RNA associated with infiltration by CD 4 +T cells...|$|R

This experimental study focused on revealing the effects of aloe vera on antioxidant systems and determining the number of <b>degenerated</b> <b>neurons</b> after cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. Methods: Twenty-one rats were divided equally into three groups: group I rats were used as controls; group II rats were fed with standard diet, and group III rats were fed with standard diet plus aloe vera for 30 days. For groups II and III, the right middle cerebral arteries were occluded for 45 min and then reperfused for 24 h. After these procedures, rats in all groups were sacrificed. The levels of malondialdehyde and nuclear respiratory factor- 1 and superoxide dismutase activity in the right cerebral cortex were measured. The number of <b>degenerated</b> <b>neurons</b> was counted in histological samples of the right cerebral cortex. Neuronal {{nitric oxide synthase expression}} was examined with immunohistochemical methods. Results: Superoxide dismutase activity and nuclear respiratory factor- 1 levels were decreased in group II compared with group I (p< 0. 05). In group III, superoxide dismutase activity and nuclear respiratory factor- 1 levels were increased compared to group II (p< 0. 05). Malondialdehyde levels were decreased in group III compared to group II (p< 0. 05). The number of <b>degenerated</b> <b>neurons</b> was lower in group III compared to group II.

40|$|Abstract Background Phosphatidylserine {{receptor}} {{is a key}} molecule that mediates the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. Milk fat globule-EGF factor 8 (MFG-E 8) is a phosphatidylserine receptor that {{is expressed}} on various macrophage lineage cells, including microglia in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). Targeted clearance of <b>degenerated</b> <b>neurons</b> by microglia is essential to maintain healthy neural networks. We previously showed that the CX 3 C chemokine fractalkine is secreted from <b>degenerated</b> <b>neurons</b> and accelerates microglial clearance of neuronal debris via inducing the release of MFG-E 8. However, the mechanisms by which microglia produce MFG-E 8 and the precise functions of MFG-E 8 are unknown. Methods The release of MFG-E 8 from microglia treated with conditioned medium from neurons exposed to neurotoxic substances, glutamate or oligomeric amyloid β (oAβ) was measured by ELISA. The neuroprotective effects of MFG-E 8 and MFG-E 8 [*]−[*]induced microglial phagocytosis of oAβ were assessed by immunocytochemistry. The effects of MFG-E 8 on the production of the anti-oxidative enzyme hemeoxygenase- 1 (HO- 1) were determined by ELISA and immunocytochemisty. Results MFG-E 8 was induced in microglia treated with conditioned medium from neurons that had been exposed to neurotoxicants, glutamate or oAβ. MFG-E 8 significantly attenuated oAβ-induced neuronal cell death in a primary neuron[*]−[*]microglia coculture system. Microglial phagocytosis of oAβ was accelerated by MFG-E 8 treatment due to increased CD 47 expression in the absence of neurotoxic molecule production, such as tumor necrosis factor-α, nitric oxide, and glutamate. MFG-E 8 [*]−[*]treated microglia induced nuclear factor E(2) [*]−[*]related factor 2 (Nrf 2) [*]−[*]mediated HO- 1 production, which also contributed to neuroprotection. Conclusions These results suggest that microglia release MFG-E 8 in response to signals from <b>degenerated</b> <b>neurons</b> and that MFG-E 8 protects oAβ-induced neuronal cell death by promoting microglial phagocytic activity and activating the Nrf 2 -HO- 1 pathway. Thus, MFG-E 8 may have novel roles as a neuroprotectant in neurodegenerative conditions. </p...|$|R

40|$|HD (Huntington&#x 0027;s disease) is {{characterized}} by dysfunction and death of striatal MSNs (medium-sized spiny neurons). Excitotoxicity, transcriptional dysregulation and mitochondrial abnormalities are among the mechanisms that are proposed to play roles in HD pathogenesis. To {{determine the extent of}} cell-autonomous effects of mhtt (mutant huntingtin) protein on vulnerability to excitotoxic insult in MSNs in vivo, we measured the number of <b>degenerating</b> <b>neurons</b> in response to intrastriatal injection of QA (quinolinic acid) in presymptomatic and symptomatic transgenic (D 9 -N 171 - 98 Q, also known as DE 5) mice that express mhtt in MSNs but not in cortex. After QA, the number of <b>degenerating</b> <b>neurons</b> in presymptomatic DE 5 mice was not significantly different from the number in WT (wild-type) controls, suggesting the early, increased vulnerability to excitotoxicity demonstrated in other HD mouse models has a largely non-cell-autonomous component. Conversely, symptomatic DE 5 mice showed significantly fewer <b>degenerating</b> <b>neurons</b> relative to WT, implying the resistance to excitotoxicity observed at later ages has a primarily cell-autonomous origin. Interestingly, mitochondrial complex II respiration was enhanced in striatum of symptomatic mice, whereas it was reduced in presymptomatic mice, both relative to their age-matched controls. Consistent with the QA data, MSNs from symptomatic mice showed decreased NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) currents compared with age-matched controls, suggesting that in addition to aging, cell-autonomous mechanisms mitigate susceptibility to excitotoxicity in the symptomatic stage. Also, symptomatic DE 5 mice did not display some of the electrophysiological alterations present in other HD models, suggesting that blocking the expression of mhtt in cortical neurons may restore corticostriatal function in HD...|$|E

Aims: The goal {{of this study was to}} study the effects Adamkiewicz artery (AKA) vasospasm in lumbar subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) on bowel dilatation severity. Settings and Design: An experimental rabbit study. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted on 25 rabbits, which were randomly divided into three groups: Spinal SAH (N = 13), serum saline (SS) (SS; N = 7) and control (N = 5) groups. Experimental spinal SAH was performed. After 21 days, volume values of descending parts of large bowels and <b>degenerated</b> <b>neuron</b> density of L 5 DRG were analyzed. Statistical Analysis Used: Statistical analysis was performed using the PASW Statistics 18. 0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois). Two-tailed t-test and Mann-Whitney U-tests were used.

40|$|Amyotrophic lateral {{sclerosis}} (ALS) is a fatal {{neurodegenerative disease}} {{characterized by the}} progressive loss of motor neurons. We previously showed that the expression of dynactin 1, an axon motor protein regulating retrograde transport, is markedly reduced in spinal motor neurons of sporadic ALS patients, although the mechanisms by which decreased dynactin 1 levels cause neurodegeneration {{have yet to be}} elucidated. The accumulation of autophagosomes in <b>degenerated</b> motor <b>neurons</b> is another key pathological feature of sporadic ALS. Since autophagosomes are cargo of dynein/dynactin complexes and {{play a crucial role in}} the turnover of several organelles and proteins, we hypothesized that the quantitative loss of dynactin 1 disrupts the transport of autophagosomes and induces the degeneration of motor neuron. In the present study, we generated a Caenorhabditis elegans model in which the expression of DNC- 1, the homolog of dynactin 1, is specifically knocked down in motor neurons. This model exhibited severe motor defects together with axonal and neuronal degeneration. We also observed impaired movement and increased number of autophagosomes in the <b>degenerated</b> <b>neurons.</b> Furthermore, the combination of rapamycin, an activator of autophagy, and trichostatin which facilitates axonal transport dramatically ameliorated the motor phenotype and axonal degeneration of this model. Thus, our results suggest that decreased expression of dynactin 1 induces motor neuron degeneration and that the transport of autophagosomes is a novel and substantial therapeutic target for motor neuron degeneration...|$|R

Translocation of both apoptotic factors depends on changes in intracellular calcium homeostasis and on calpain activity.

40|$|Inhibition {{of protein}} {{translation}} is {{a mode of}} inducing neuronal apoptosis and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor- 2 α (eIF 2 α) terminates global protein translation and induces apoptosis. We examined whether this signaling pathway occurs in <b>degenerating</b> <b>neurons</b> of AD. Brain sections from young individuals, age-matched control individuals and AD patients were examined for immunoreactivity of phosphorylated eIF 2 α by immunohistochemical analysis. While young brain sections did not display and age-matched brain sections have mild immunoreactive positive cells, AD brain sections revealed intense immunoreactivity for phosphorylated eIF 2 α. Most of the phosphorylated eIF 2 α immunoreactive positive neurons have high immunoreactivity for phosphorylated tau using AT 8 antibody. Also, intense staining of phosphorylated eIF 2 α is associated vacuoles in <b>degenerating</b> <b>neurons.</b> This phenomenon was also observed for the immunohistochemical staining of phosphorylated PKR (double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase), the upstream kinase for eIF 2 α.

We therefore compared FJC staining using the intrastriatal 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) -injected rat as an acute model and the zitter rat as a chronic model, as both show dopaminergic (DA) neurodegeneration. In the 6 -OHDA-injected rat, FJC-positive neurons were found in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) before the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) -positive DA neurons. In the zitter rat, FJC-labeled fibers were first detected at 1 month old (1 M) and were considerably increased in the striatum at 4 M, whereas FJC-labeled cell bodies were found at 4 M, but not at 1 M in the SNc. Furthermore, FJC-labeled neurons of the zitter rat showed TH-immunoreactivity in fibers, but little in cell bodies, while those from the 6 -OHDA-injected rat showed TH-immunoreactivity even in the cell bodies. These results demonstrate that FJC is a useful tool for detecting chronically <b>degenerating</b> <b>neurons,</b> and suggest that intracellular substances bound to FJC may accumulate in the cell bodies from fibers at a slower rate in the chronic model than in the acute model...|$|E
40|$|Neuroinflammation is {{involved}} in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Microglia, macrophage-like resident immune cells in the brain, play critical roles in the inflammatory aspects of AD. Microglia may be activated by oligomeric and fibrillar species of amyloid β (Aβ) that are constituents of senile plaques and by molecules derived from <b>degenerated</b> <b>neurons,</b> such as purines and chemokines, which enhance their migration and phagocytosis. The main neurotoxic molecules produced by activated microglia may be reactive oxygen species, glutamate, and inflammatory cytokines such as tumor-necrosis-factor-α and interleukin- (IL-) 1 β These molecules differentially induce neurotoxicity. Aβ itself directly damages neurons. In terms of neuroprotective properties, microglia treated with fractalkine or IL- 34 attenuate Aβ neurotoxicity by Aβ clearance and the production of antioxidants. Therefore, regulation of the microglial role in neuroprotection may be a useful therapeutic strategy for AD...|$|R

By contrast, increased phosphorylation of APP is a pathological trait of Alzheimer's disease. APP is overexpressed in Down's syndrome, a condition that occasionally leads to increased APP phosphorylation, in cultured cells. Whether phosphorylation of APP in normal versus high APP conditions occurs by similar or distinct signaling pathways is not known. Here, we addressed this problem using brainstem-derived neurons (CAD cells). CAD cells that ectopically overexpress APP frequently show features of <b>degenerating</b> <b>neurons.</b> We found that, in degenerating cells, APP is hyperphosphorylated and colocalizes with early endosomes. By contrast, in normal CAD cells, phosphorylated APP (pAPP) is excluded from endosomes, and localizes to the Golgi apparatus and to transport vesicles within the neurites. Whereas the neuritic APP is phosphorylated by c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase through a pathway that is modulated by glycogen synthase kinase 3 β, the endosomal pAPP in degenerated CAD cells results from activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 5. Additional signaling pathways, leading to APP phosphorylation, become active during stress and mitosis.

To evaluate the functional significance of ATF 3 /c-Jun in the peripheral nervous system, we examined neuronal cell death, activation of ATF 3 /c-Jun, and microglial responses in facial motor nuclei up to 24 weeks after an extracranial facial nerve axotomy in adult rats. Following the axotomy, neuronal survival rate was progressively but significantly reduced to 79. 1 % at 16 weeks post-lesion (wpl) and to 65. 2 % at 24 wpl. ATF 3 and phosphorylated c-Jun (pc-Jun) were detected {{in the majority of}} ipsilateral facial motoneurons with normal size and morphology during the early stage of degeneration (1 - 2 wpl). Thereafter, the number of facial motoneurons decreased gradually, and both ATF 3 and pc-Jun were identified in <b>degenerating</b> <b>neurons</b> only.

Several antibodies identified phosphorylated NF-H subunit, which occurred preferentially in those aged between 60 and 80 years and were localized in <b>degenerating</b> <b>neurons.</b> Such neurons also contained neurofibrillary tangles, but neurofilament aggregates did not co-localize with tangles, nor did the quantity nor the number of NF-positive neurons correlate with the severity of Alzheimer's disease. This points to a susceptibility of NF in a subset of neurons for phosphorylation- and metabolically related morphological changes during neurodegeneration...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIncreasing {{evidence}} suggests that an inhibition of the proteasome, as demonstrated in Parkinson’s disease, might be involved in Alzheimer’s disease. In this disease and other Tauopathies, Tau proteins are hyperphosphorylated and aggregated within <b>degenerating</b> <b>neurons.</b> In this state, Tau is also ubiquitinated, suggesting that the proteasome might be involved in Tau proteolysis. Thus, to investigate if proteasome inhibition leads to accumulation, hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of Tau, we used neuroblastoma cells overexpressing Tau proteins. Surprisingly, we showed that the inhibition of the proteasome led to a bidirectional degradation of Tau. Following this result, the cellular mechanisms that may degrade Tau were investigated...|$|E
40|$|Autophagy, a {{cellular}} process of cytoplasmic degradation and recycling, is induced in Drosophila larval tissues during metamorphosis, potentially contributing to their destruction or reorganization. Unexpectedly, {{we find that}} flies lacking the core autophagy regulator Atg 7 are viable, despite severe defects in autophagy. Although metamorphic cell death is perturbed in Atg 7 mutants, the larval–adult midgut transition proceeds normally, with extended pupal development compensating for reduced autophagy. Atg 7 −/− adults are short-lived, hypersensitive to nutrient and oxidative stress, and accumulate ubiquitin-positive aggregates in <b>degenerating</b> <b>neurons.</b> Thus, normal levels of autophagy are crucial for stress survival and continuous cellular renewal, but not metamorphosis...|$|E
40|$|Cell {{replacement}} therapy {{is a widely}} discussed novel concept of medical treatment. The increased knowledge in the stem cell field, particularly pluripotent stem cells, potentially provides powerful tools for this therapeutic concept. A large number of disease characterized {{by the loss of}} functional cells are potential candidates for cell {{replacement therapy}} and, in this regards, Parkinson's disease is of particular interest. It {{is one of the most}} prevalent neurodegenerative diseases caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the Substantia nigra pars compacta. Pharmacological therapies are valuable but suffer from the progressive decline of efficacy as the disease progresses. Cell therapy application has emerged about two decades ago as a valid therapeutic alternative and recent advances in stem cell research suggest that pluripotent stem cell transplantation may be a promising approach to replace <b>degenerated</b> <b>neurons</b> in Parkinson's disease. Various sources of pluripotent stem cells (PSC) currently tested in animal models of Parkinson's disease have proven their efficacy in relieving symptoms and restoring damaged brain function. This review summarizes and discusses the important challenges that actually must be solved before the first studies of PSC transplantation can be undertaken into humans...|$|R

Currently, there is no effective treatment for the marked neuronal loss caused by neurodegenerative diseases, such as Huntington’s disease (HD) or ischemic stroke. However, {{recent studies have shown}} that new neurons are continuously generated by endogenous neural stem cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the adult mammalian brain, including the human brain. Because some of these new neurons migrate to the injured striatum and differentiate into mature neurons, such new neurons may be able to replace <b>degenerated</b> <b>neurons</b> and improve or repair neurological deficits. To establish a neuroregenerative therapy using this endogenous system, endogenous regulatory mechanisms that can be co-opted for efficient regenerative interventions must be understood, along with any potential drawbacks. Here, we review current knowledge on the generation of new neurons in the adult brain and discuss their potential for use in replacing striatal neurons lost to neurodegenerative diseases, including HD, and to ischemic stroke. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{manganese}} toxicity on the ultrastructure of the olfactory bulb was evaluated. Male albino mice were injected intraperitoneally with MnCl 2 (5 mg/Kg/day) five {{days per week}} during nine weeks. The control group received NaCl (0. 9 %). The olfactory bulbs of five mice from each group were processed for transmission electron microscopy after 2, 4, 6 and 9 weeks of manganese treatment. On week 2, some disorganization of the myelin sheaths was observed. After 4 weeks, <b>degenerated</b> <b>neurons</b> with dilated cisternae of rough endoplasmic reticulum and swollen mitochondria appeared. A certain degree of gliosis with a predominance of astrocytes with swollen mitochondria, disorganization of the endomembrane system, dilation of the perinuclear cisternae and irregularly shaped nuclei with abnormal chromatin distribution were observed after 6 weeks. Some glial cells showed disorganization of the Golgi apparatus. On week 9, {{an increase in the}} number of astrocytes, whose mitochondrial cristae were partially or totally erased, and a dilation of the rough endoplasmic reticulum were found. <b>Neurons</b> appear <b>degenerated,</b> with swollen mitochondria and a vacuolated, electron dense cytoplasm. These changes seem to indicate that the olfactory bulb is sensitive to the toxic effects of manganese...|$|R
