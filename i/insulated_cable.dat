25|$|Electrical wiring {{distributes}} {{electric power}} inside residential, commercial, or industrial buildings, mobile homes, recreational vehicles, boats, and substations at voltages up to 600 V. The {{thickness of the}} wire is based on amperage requirements in conjunction with safe operating temperatures. Solid wire is used for smaller diameters; thicker diameters are stranded to provide flexibility. Conductor types include non-metallic/non-metallic corrosion-resistant cable (two or more insulated conductors with a nonmetallic outer sheath), armored or BX cable (cables are surrounded by a flexible metal enclosure), metal clad cable, service entrance cable, underground feeder cable, TC cable, fire resistant cable, and mineral <b>insulated</b> <b>cable,</b> including mineral-insulated copper-clad cable. Copper is commonly used for building wire because of its conductivity, strength, and reliability. Over {{the life of a}} building wire system, copper can also be the most economical conductor.|$|E

40|$|Capítulos en librosDuring {{the last}} ten years Iberdrola Distribución Eléctrica has built a {{considerable}} number of high voltage/medium voltage transformer stations in urban areas using high voltage (220 kV and 132 kV) Gas Insulated Substations (GISs). The typical configuration of such GISs is double bar with two transmission line bays, two transformer bays and a coupling bay. Overhead transmission lines and power transformers are connected to the GIS using either <b>insulated</b> <b>cables</b> or Gas <b>Insulated</b> Lines (GILs) of different length. The protection of the power transformers against lightning overvoltages is performed with surge arresters at the connection point of the overhead lines with either the <b>insulated</b> <b>cables</b> or the GILs. This paper reports an exhaustive study conducted by Iberdrola aimed at assessing the performance of the protective scheme in three configurations in both 132 kV and 220 kV stations: 1. Power transformers are connected to the GIS using GILSs. Overhead lines are connected to the GIS also using GILs. 2. Power transformers are connected to the GIS using <b>insulated</b> <b>cables.</b> Overhead lines are connected to the GIS also using <b>insulated</b> <b>cables.</b> 3. Power transformers are connected to the GIS using <b>insulated</b> <b>cables.</b> Overhead lines are connected to the GIS using GILs. Very detailed models of the stations for electromagnetic transient simulation have been developed using manufacturer data of the GISs, <b>insulated</b> <b>cables,</b> GILs, power transformers and surge arresters. The study has comprised simulation of a reference case of each configuration and several sensitivity studies with respect to the length of the <b>insulated</b> <b>cables</b> and the GILs. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

50|$|Callender's, {{originally}} an importer and refiner of bitumen {{for road}} construction, began manufacturing <b>insulated</b> <b>cables</b> in the 1880s at their Erith {{site on the}} Thames. British <b>Insulated</b> <b>Cables</b> had its origins in 1890 in the British Insulated Wire Company of Prescot, near Liverpool.

50|$|Current {{transformers}} {{are often}} constructed by passing a single primary turn (either an <b>insulated</b> <b>cable</b> or an uninsulated bus bar) through a well-insulated toroidal core wrapped with many turns of wire. This affords easy implementation on high voltage bushings of grid transformers {{and other devices}} by installing the secondary turn core inside high-voltage bushing insulators and using the pass-through conductor as a single turn primary.|$|E
50|$|An insulation-displacement contact (IDC), {{also known}} as insulation-piercing contact (IPC), is an {{electrical}} connector designed {{to be connected to}} the conductor(s) of an <b>insulated</b> <b>cable</b> by a connection process which forces a selectively sharpened blade or blades through the insulation, bypassing the need to strip the conductors of insulation before connecting. When properly made, the connector blade cold-welds to the conductor, making a theoretically reliable gas-tight connection.|$|E
50|$|In the United Kingdom, {{an early}} form of <b>insulated</b> <b>cable,</b> {{introduced}} in 1896, {{consisted of two}} impregnated-paper-insulated conductors in an overall lead sheath. Joints were soldered, and special fittings were used for lamp holders and switches. These cables were similar to underground telegraph and telephone cables of the time. Paper-insulated cables proved unsuitable for interior wiring installations because very careful workmanship was required on the lead sheaths to ensure moisture {{did not affect the}} insulation.|$|E
50|$|British <b>Insulated</b> Callender's <b>Cables</b> {{was formed}} in 1945 by the merger of two long {{established}} cable firms, Callender's Cable & Construction Company Limited and British <b>Insulated</b> <b>Cables.</b> Subsidiaries could trace their roots back to submarine cable manufacturing on the Thames in the 1850s. The company was renamed BICC Ltd in 1975.|$|R

50|$|A {{ground power}} unit (GPU) is a vehicle capable of {{supplying}} power to aircraft parked on the ground. Ground power units may also be built into the jetway, making it even easier to supply electrical power to aircraft. Many aircraft require 28 V of direct current and 115 V 400 Hz of alternating current. The electric energy is carried from a generator to a connection on the aircraft via 3 phase 4-wire <b>insulated</b> <b>cable</b> capable of handling 261 amps (90 kVA). These connectors are standard for all aircraft, as defined in ISO 6858.|$|E
50|$|For some {{industrial}} uses in steel mills and similar hot environments, no organic material gives satisfactory service. Cables insulated with compressed mica flakes are sometimes used. Another form of high-temperature cable is a mineral <b>insulated</b> <b>cable,</b> with individual conductors placed within a copper tube {{and the space}} filled with magnesium oxide powder. The whole assembly is drawn down to smaller sizes, thereby compressing the powder. Such cables have a certified fire resistance rating and are more costly than non-fire rated cable. They have little flexibility and behave more like rigid conduit rather than flexible cables.|$|E
5000|$|An {{aerial cable}} or air cable is an <b>insulated</b> <b>cable</b> usually {{containing}} all conductors required for an electrical transmission system or a telecommunication line, which is suspended between utility poles or electricity pylons. As aerial cables are completely insulated {{there is no}} danger of electric shock when touching them {{and there is no}} requirement for mounting them with insulators on pylons and poles.A further advantage is they require less right of way than overhead lines for the same reason. They can be designed as shielded cables for telecommunication purposes. If the cable falls, it may still operate if its insulation is not damaged.|$|E
5000|$|Formed in the United States in 1925, the <b>Insulated</b> <b>Cables</b> Engineers Association, Inc. (ICEA), is a not-for profit {{professional}} association. In {{conjunction with}} other organizations like NEMA and ANSI, it produces technical {{standards for the}} manufacture and use of power cable, data, and control cable. It was founded as the <b>Insulated</b> Power <b>Cables</b> Engineers Association, but changed names to reflect their full range of activities.|$|R

The company's product range is used for electrical usage, transmission of voice, data and images, for domestic, commercial and industrial applications, and for electrical products. Its electrical cables products include 1100 volt PVC <b>insulated</b> <b>cables,</b> motor winding PVC <b>insulated</b> <b>cables</b> and three core flat cables,automotive/battery cables, UPS cables, heavy duty, underground, low voltage, power and control cables, and heavy duty, underground, high voltage, power cables.|$|R
5000|$|IEC 60228 is the International Electrotechnical Commission's {{international}} standard on conductors of <b>insulated</b> <b>cables.</b> The current version is Third Edition 2004-11 Among other things, it defines {{a set of}} standard wire cross-sectional areas: ...|$|R
50|$|These {{components}} are connected on a backbone of thick and <b>insulated</b> <b>cable</b> called a spur cable that has two separated lines for transmitting {{the data in}} opposite directions. The instruments transmit the data either clockwise or counter clockwise within a 2 by 2 Gbit/s data flow. Since {{the primary purpose of}} the system is data collection and analysis, the available instruments generate data of various size and nature. The collected data is then transmitted on the spur cable passing through all the routers that are on one of the best alternative paths of the data flow.|$|E
50|$|Electric {{power can}} also be {{transmitted}} by underground power cables instead of overhead power lines. Underground cables take up less right-of-way than overhead lines, have lower visibility, and are less affected by bad weather. However, costs of <b>insulated</b> <b>cable</b> and excavation are much higher than overhead construction. Faults in buried transmission lines take longer to locate and repair. Underground lines are strictly limited by their thermal capacity, which permits less overload or re-rating than overhead lines. Long underground AC cables have significant capacitance, which may reduce their ability to provide useful power to loads beyond 50 mi. DC cables are not limited in length by their capacitance.|$|E
50|$|Medium and {{high-voltage}} power cables, in circuits over 2000 volts, {{usually have}} a shield layer of copper or aluminium tape or conducting polymer. If an unshielded <b>insulated</b> <b>cable</b> is in contact with earth or a grounded object, the electrostatic field around the conductor will be concentrated at the contact point, resulting in corona discharge, and eventual destruction of the insulation. Leakage current and capacitive current through the insulation presents a danger of electrical shock. The grounded shield equalizes electrical stress around the conductor, diverts any leakage current to ground. Stress relief cones should be applied at the shield ends, especially for cables operating at more than 2 kV to earth.|$|E
5000|$|In 1936-1938 the Contractors' Committee, a {{joint venture}} of Metropolitan-Vickers and English Electric, had {{supplied}} six [...] electric locomotives and 80 three-car electric multiple units for the electrification of Warsaw suburban services. British <b>Insulated</b> <b>Cables</b> supplied the overhead line equipment. In 1945 British Insulated merged with a competitor to become British <b>Insulated</b> Callender's <b>Cables,</b> and in 1949 Metropolitan-Vickers, English Electric and BICC contracts to replace locomotives, EMUs and equipment damaged in the Second World War.|$|R
5000|$|On a {{visit to}} St Petersburg in 1880, Callender was {{impressed}} by opera house being lit by Yablochkov candles. To exploit the developing market for electric lighting, Callender decided to change the business towards the production of high-current <b>insulated</b> <b>cables.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Insulated</b> <b>cables</b> {{are rated}} by their {{allowable}} operating voltage and their {{maximum operating temperature}} at the conductor surface. A cable may carry multiple usage ratings for applications, for example, one rating for dry installations and another when exposed to moisture or oil.|$|R
50|$|In {{electrical}} cables {{different conditions}} govern, and installation regulations normally specify {{that the most}} severe condition along the run will govern each cable conductor's rating. Cables run in wet or oily locations may carry a lower temperature rating than in a dry installation. Derating is necessary for multiple cables in close proximity. When multiple cables are in close proximity, each contributes heat to the others and diminishes the amount of external cooling affecting the individual cable conductors. The overall ampacity of <b>insulated</b> <b>cable</b> conductors in a bundle of more than three cables must also be derated, whether in a raceway or cable. Usually the derating factor is tabulated in a nation's wiring regulations.|$|E

5000|$|Current {{transformers}} {{are often}} constructed by passing a single primary turn (either an <b>insulated</b> <b>cable</b> or an uninsulated bus bar) through a well-insulated toroidal core wrapped with many turns of wire. The CT is typically described by its current ratio from primary to secondary. For example, a 1000:1 CT provides an output current of 1 amperes when 1000 amperes {{flow through the}} primary winding. Standard secondary current ratings are 5 amperes or 1 ampere, compatible with standard measuring instruments. The secondary winding can be single ratio or have several tap points to provide a range of ratios. Care {{must be taken to}} make sure the secondary winding is not disconnected from its low-impedance load while current flows in the primary, as this may produce a dangerously high voltage across the open secondary and may permanently affect the accuracy of the transformer.|$|E
