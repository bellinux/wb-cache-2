500|$|Another series-long story arc {{explored}} {{how other}} people learn of Henry's immortality. [...] The first storyline in the arc was the season's second story arc, Henry's determination {{to learn the}} identity of a second immortal who <b>knows</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> The second immortal character's morals would contrast his protagonist's morals, serving as an antagonist for the main character. [...] As for the family element, Miller created a family with a 35-year-old immortal having a mortal son in his 70s. [...] Miller stated in an interview with BuddyTV writer Catherine Cabanela that he had never seen that type of family on television before, and he believed that it provide the show with an emotional element.|$|E
500|$|In the 1990s, Freddie Meeks, {{one of the}} few {{still alive}} among the group of 50, was urged to {{petition}} the President for a pardon. Others of the Port Chicago 50 had refused to ask for a pardon, reasoning that a pardon is for guilty people receiving forgiveness; they continued to hold the position that they were not guilty of mutiny. Meeks pushed for a pardon {{as a way to get}} the story out, saying [...] "I hope that all of America <b>knows</b> <b>about</b> <b>it...</b> it's something that's been in the closet for so long." [...] In September 1999, the petition by Meeks was bolstered by 37 members of Congress including George Miller, the U.S. representative for the district containing the disaster site. The 37 Congressmen sent a letter to President Bill Clinton and in December 1999, Clinton pardoned Meeks, who died in June 2003. Efforts to posthumously exonerate all 50 sailors have continued. In 2004, author Robert L. Allen was reported as saying [...] "...even for today it's important to have these convictions set aside." ...|$|E
500|$|The pop rock album {{opens with}} the curtain call, {{strengthening}} {{the impression of}} a live recording rather than a studio album. Carlile performed [...] "Shadow on the Wall", [...] "Turpentine", and [...] "The Story", which had appeared on Carlile's second studio album The Story (2007). [...] "Looking Out", [...] "Before It Breaks", [...] "I Will", [...] "Dreams", and [...] "Pride and Joy" [...] had all appeared on Give Up the Ghost. Believing in the cultivation of standards, Carlile included six cover versions in the set list, three of which appear on the album. [...] "Sixty Years On", originally written by Elton John and Bernie Taupin, was arranged by Paul Buckmaster. Carlile, a fan of the [...] "dark" [...] string arrangements that appear on John's album Tumbleweed Connection (1970), contacted Buckmaster on the advice of her manager. Carlile first heard the Hanseroth brothers singing Paul Simon's [...] "The Sound of Silence" [...] in 2009 and asked them to perform it during the set. She does not contribute vocals to the version that appears on the album. Carlile's cover of Leonard Cohen's [...] "Hallelujah", also arranged by Buckmaster, is followed by a hidden track: a cover of Alphaville's [...] "Forever Young". Carlile said the following of Cohen's song: [...] "Hallelujah" [...] {{is going to be a}} standard that our grandkids, our great-great grandkids will learn to sing in church. It's one of those really, really special songs. The thing that's going to make it that, besides that it's so great, is that everyone <b>knows</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> because hundreds of songwriters have been moved by that song and have covered it. And that's just something really important that we do in every generation.|$|E

If they don't want them to listen to records that are very sexual or explicit or outrageous, they should have control over that situation. As for adults, they're going to buy whatever kind of music they want to hear, so if they buy music with explicit lyrics, they must like it." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{comments}} a {{week after}} this reading, Baraka was quoted by New Jersey's largest newspaper The Star-Ledger: [...] "The Israelis <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> just like Bush <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> just like the Germans <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> just like the French <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Bush couldn’t hope for a better legitimization of his {{trying to make the}} Middle East a gas station." [...] Despite this, Baraka denies that his poem is anti-Semitic pointing to the accusation in the poem's text which he claims is directed only against Israelis rather than Jews as a people. The Anti-Defamation League denounced the poem as antisemitic and have pointed to several examples of a long pattern of anti-Semitism in his work and public statements though Baraka and his defenders defined his position as Anti-Zionism.|$|R

But who <b>knows</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> in Israel today? Who will take the initiative and explain it? The momentum will not last forever. This is a dangerous situation.

2500|$|The {{movie is}} based on Sully's {{autobiography}} , rights to which were optioned by producers Frank Marshall and Allyn Stewart in 2010. They developed the screenplay with Stewart's partner executive producer Kipp Nelson, hiring screenwriter Todd Komarnicki. From the start, Sullenberger wanted the film to encompass [...] "that sense of our common humanity", noting that the incident had taken place shortly after the 2008 Great Recession. He explains: [...] "People were wondering if everything was about self-interest and greed. They were doubting human nature. Then all these people acted together, selflessly, to get something really important done. In a way, I think it gave everyone {{a chance to have}} hope, {{at a time when we}} all needed it." [...] Komarnicki said the difficulty was not depicting the landing in the river, but the investigation afterwards: [...] "It wasn't really a challenge of what to do with the event since that is the thing everyone <b>knows</b> <b>about,</b> <b>it</b> was more about how you parse out the information about the man slowly falling apart and becoming a hero in the eyes of the world when internally and with the investigators it was actually seemingly going the other way." ...|$|E
