40|$|PURPOSE: To review {{cases of}} bone and soft <b>tissue</b> <b>tumours</b> {{of the feet}} managed at the Hyogo College of Medicine, Nishinomiya and Takarazuka Municipal Hospital, Takarazuka, Japan. METHODS: Retrospective {{analysis}} of 83 patient records treated for bone and soft <b>tissue</b> <b>tumours</b> of the feet between 1974 and 2000. RESULTS: There were 33 benign bone tumours, one primary malignant bone tumour, and 2 metastatic bone cancer. Marginal resection was performed in cases of osteochondroma and curettage in cases of other benign bone tumour. Despite below-knee amputation {{in the case of}} chondrosarcoma, the patient died because of pulmonary metastasis. Two patients with metastatic cancer also died, and 2 cases of osteochondroma and one of benign chondroblastoma recurred. There were 47 cases of soft <b>tissue</b> <b>tumour.</b> Treatment for benign soft <b>tissue</b> <b>tumours</b> was marginal resection; no cases recurred. In contrast, all patients with soft tissue sarcoma died after surgery. The majority of bone tumours were located in the toe and hindfoot areas, in the first and second decades of life, whereas soft <b>tissue</b> <b>tumours</b> occurred mainly in the midfoot area and in patients aged between 20 and 50 years. The sex distribution was almost even for bone tumours (male: female ratio, 19 : 17), whereas about half as many males as females had soft <b>tissue</b> <b>tumours</b> (14 : 33). CONCLUSION: Bone and soft <b>tissue</b> <b>tumours</b> of the feet are uncommon. Most bone tumours are chondrogenic, but differential diagnosis of malignant from benign disease is difficult and prognosis is poor. Management of benign tumours by marginal resection has good prognosis, whereas prognosis of soft tissue sarcomas is very poor...|$|R

40|$|Arabidopsis thaliana {{serves as}} an {{excellent}} model from which to study plant embryonic development. A family of proteins that has been targeted for much study in this mustard plant is the MADS domain family and includes proteins that regulate flower development and seed dispersal in Arabidopsis. There is some speculation that these proteins may {{also play a role}} in the regulation of embryonic development. Specifically, the MADS domain protein, AGL 15, has been found to be expressed preferentially in <b>embryonic</b> <b>tissue</b> and has been shown to be translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus during embryonic development. These observations suggest that AGL 15 might serve as a transcription factor that regulates embryonic development. Because agl 15 -loss-of-function mutants show no phenotypic defects, it has been proposed that another MADS domain protein may overlap in function with AGL 15. An RT-PCR screen is currently being performed in order to identify other MADS domain sequences present in <b>embryonic</b> <b>tissue.</b> PCR primers specific for AGL 24, Short Vegetative Phase (SVP), AGL 15 -like- 1, and AGL 15 -like- 2 were used to screen for the presence of these proteins in <b>embryonic</b> <b>tissue.</b> None were found to be expressed in <b>embryonic</b> <b>tissue...</b>|$|R

Of the 47 lesions with sufficient material for cytology and that were postoperatively diagnosed histologically, 35 (including one recurrent lesion) were correctly diagnosed by fine needle aspiration cytology.

Twenty-three patients suffering from tubal EP and twenty-nine patients with a normal ongoing pregnancy scheduled for a VTOP were recruited. <b>Embryonic</b> <b>tissue</b> samples were analyzed by miRNA microarray and further validated by real time PCR. Microarray studies showed that four miRNAs were differentially downregulated (hsa-mir- 196 b, hsa-mir- 30 a, hsa-mir- 873, and hsa-mir- 337 - 3 p) and three upregulated (hsa-mir- 1288, hsa-mir- 451, and hsa-mir- 223) in EP compared to control tissue samples. Hsa-miR- 196, hsa-miR- 223, and hsa-miR- 451 were further validated by real time PCR in a wider population of EP and control samples. We also performed a computational analysis to identify the gene targets and pathways which might be modulated by these three differentially expressed miRNAs. The most significant pathways found were the mucin type O-glycan biosynthesis and the ECM-receptor-interaction pathways. We also checked that the dysregulation of these three miRNAs was able to alter the expression of the gene targets in the <b>embryonic</b> <b>tissues</b> included in these pathways such as GALNT 13 and ITGA 2 genes. In conclusion, analysis of miRNAs in ectopic and eutopic <b>embryonic</b> <b>tissues</b> shows different expression patterns that could modify pathways which are critical for correct implantation, providing new insights into the understanding of ectopic implantation in humans...|$|R

40|$|Background: Molecular {{feedback}} loops involving transcription and {{translation and}} several key genes {{are at the}} core of circadian regulatory cycles affecting cellular pathways and metabolism. These cycles are active in most adult animal cells but little is known about their expression or influence during development. Methodology/Principal Findings: To determine if circadian cycles are active during mammalian development we measured the expression of key circadian genes during embryogenesis in mice using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. All of the genes examined were expressed in whole embryos beginning at the earliest age examined, embryonic day 10. In contrast to adult tissues, circadian variation was absent for all genes at all of the embryonic ages examined in either whole embryos or individual tissues. Using a bioluminescent fusion protein that tracks translation of the circadian gene, per 2, we also analyzed protein levels. Similar to mRNA, a protein rhythm was observed in adult tissue but not in <b>embryonic</b> <b>tissues</b> collected in-vivo. In contrast, when tissues were placed in culture for the continuous assay of bioluminescence, rhythms were observed in <b>embryonic</b> (E 18) <b>tissues.</b> We found that placing <b>embryonic</b> <b>tissues</b> in culture set the timing (phase) of these rhythms, suggesting the importance of a synchronizing signal for the expression of circadian cycles in developing tissues. Conclusions/Significance: These results show that <b>embryonic</b> <b>tissues</b> express key circadian genes and have the capacity to express active circadian regulatory cycles. In vivo, circadian cycles are not expressed in <b>embryonic</b> <b>tissues</b> as they are in adult tissues. Individual cells might express oscillations, but are not synchronized until later in development...|$|R

In dogs diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma, the relationship of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to-globulin ratio to histological tumour grade (I to III) was assessed.
