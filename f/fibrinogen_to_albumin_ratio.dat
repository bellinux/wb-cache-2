Molar ratio of protein adsorption of <b>fibrinogen</b> <b>to</b> <b>albumin</b> (F/A molar <b>ratio)</b> on polymer surface was measured. The F/A molar ratio was affected by surface composition. The surface composition was identified by ESCA measurement and quantified by the absorption ratio of carbonyl group to butadiene group (C=O/C=C ratio) on the FTIR–ATR spectra. Low F/A molar ratio and high contact angle were found on these PUs. The F/A molar ratio was decreased by the increase of soft segment or C–H bond dispersed on the surface. Frequency difference () and shiftment, hydrogen bonding index (HBI) and glass transition temperature difference (Tg) {{as a measure of}} phase homogeneity and the average strength of interpolymer hydrogen bonds were utilized to study the change of surface composition and intermolecular interaction of the prepared PUs.

A total of 216 osteosarcoma patients {{were enrolled in the}} study. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses between the groups were performed and Kaplan–Meier analysis was conducted to plot the survival curves. Receiver operating characteristic curves were generated and areas under the curve (AUCs) were compared to assess the discriminatory ability of the inflammation-based indicators, including CRP/Alb ratio, Glasgow prognostic score (GPS), neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and platelet–lymphocyte ratio (PLR). The optimal cutoff value was 0. 210 for CRP/Alb ratio with a Youden index of 0. 319. Higher values of CRP/Alb ratio were significantly associated with poorer overall survival in univariate (HR = 2. 62, 95 % CI = 1. 70 – 4. 03; P< 0. 001) and multivariate (HR = 2. 21, 95 % CI = 1. 40 – 3. 49; P= 0. 001) analyses. In addition, the CRP/Alb ratio had significantly higher AUC values compared with GPS (P= 0. 003), NLR (P< 0. 001), and PLR (P< 0. 001).

Major differences in the regressions of total calcium on ultrafilterable calcium occurred at albumin concentrations of 1, 2, and 9 g/dl but only small differences at albumin concentrations between 3, 5 and 7 g/dl. When albumin concentration was kept constant, the amount of calcium bound <b>to</b> <b>albumin</b> varied directly with ultrafilterable calcium. At any constant ultrafilterable calcium concentration albumin bound calcium varied inversely with the albumin concentrations when albumin was greater than 3 g/dl.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{our study}} was to {{evaluate}} the prognostic value of glomerular and tubular proteinuria and tubular enzymuria as early indicators of therapeutic response to induction therapy with i. v. pulse cyclophosphamide (CyC) and methylprednisolone (MP) in patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) associated glomerulonephritis. Methods and Findings: An observational single-center {{study was conducted in}} 30 patients with ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis. Patients were divided into subgroups with good or poor response to CyC therapy according to clinical and laboratory parameters. The diagnosis of ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis was based on the Chapel-Hill disease definitions. Good response to induction therapy was significantly associated with higher absolute values of urine N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) to creatinine ratio (above 14. 83 microcat/mol) and urine immunoglobulin G (IgG) <b>to</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>ratio</b> (above 0. 09) at the time of diagnosis, while albuminuria or proteinuria did not have any early predictive value.

40|$|In {{previous}} work {{the existence of}} free thyrox-ine in human serum was verified by dialysis through cellophane; the concentration of the un-bound hormone in normal human serum was found to approximate one-thousandth of the total thy-roxine (1). This direct measurement of free thyroxine was in reasonable agreement with the theoretical value computed from data on the per cent of total thyroxine bound <b>to</b> <b>albumin</b> in serum and from the binding constants for the interaction between thyroxine and human serum albumin (2, 3). This theoretical value of expected free thy-roxine concentration was {{in accordance with the}} earlier calculations of Robbins and Rall (4), based upon Lein's equilibrium dialysis studies of the interaction between thyroxine and bovine se-rum albumin (5). Recent studies of the binding of thyroxine by albumin in our own (6) and in other laboratories (7 - 11) have indicated the existence of a single strong binding site on the protein molecule rather than a primary class of four equal binding loci, as originally proposed (2, 3). The data, to be re-ported separately in detail (6), suggest that the albumin molecule possesses a single strong bind-ing site with an association constant approximating 500, 000, a secondary class of three or four sites of intermediate affinity for thyroxine, and a ter-tiary class of many weaker sites.

40|$|ObjectiveThe study {{objective}} {{was to examine the}} utility of using proteinuria in preoperative risk stratification for acute kidney injury. Acute kidney injury is a common and important complication for patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Proteinuria, which reflects structural damage to the glomeruli or renal tubules, may aid the prediction of acute kidney injury. MethodsThe urine <b>albumin</b> <b>to</b> creatinine <b>ratio</b> and dipstick proteinuria concentration were prospectively measured in 1159 patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The cohort was organized into 4 clinical risk categories based on the preoperative urine <b>albumin</b> <b>to</b> creatinine ratio: 10 mg/g or less (≤ 1. 1 mg/mmol), 11 to 29 mg/g (1. 2 – 3. 3 mg/mmol), 30 to 299 mg/g (3. 4 – 33. 8 mg/mmol), and 300 mg/g or greater (≥ 33. 9 mg/mmol). The primary outcome was postoperative acute kidney injury, defined by the Acute Kidney Injury Network stage I criterion (serum creatinine increase ≥ 50 % or ≥ 0. 3 mg/dL; 26. 5 μmol/L). ResultsAn increase in the incidence of acute kidney injury was noted across the urine <b>albumin</b> <b>to</b> creatinine <b>ratio</b> categories. Adding the urine <b>albumin</b> <b>to</b> creatinine <b>ratio</b> to the clinical model to predict acute kidney injury improved the area under the curve from 0. 67 to 0. 70 (P < . 001), and the continuous net reclassification improvement was 29 % (P < . 001). The urine <b>albumin</b> <b>to</b> creatinine <b>ratio</b> was also independently associated with the risk of in-hospital dialysis and intensive care unit and hospital lengths of stay. Surgery status and preoperative glomerular filtration rate were effect modifiers; the association was stronger among those undergoing elective surgery and those with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 45 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2 or greater.

The prognostic significance of several inflammatory indicators, including neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet–lymphocyte ratio (PLR), Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS), C-reactive protein <b>to</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>ratio</b> (CRP/Alb ratio), lymphocyte–monocyte ratio (LMR), and neutrophil–platelet score (NPS), {{were found to}} be correlated with prognosis in several cancers. However, the prognostic role of these inflammatory biomarkers in Ewing sarcoma has not been evaluated. This study enrolled 122 Ewing patients. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was generated to determine optimal cutoff values; areas under the curves (AUCs) were assessed to show the discriminatory ability of the biomarkers; Kaplan–Meier analysis was conducted to plot the survival curves; and Cox multivariate survival analysis was performed to identify independent prognostic factors. The optimal cutoff values of CRP/Alb ratio, NLR, PLR, and LMR were 0. 225, 2. 38, 131, and 4. 41, respectively. CRP/Alb ratio had a significantly larger AUC than NLR, PLR, LMR, and NPS. Higher levels of CRP/Alb ratio (hazard ratio [HR] 2. 41, P= 0. 005), GPS (HR 2. 27, P= 0. 006), NLR (HR 2. 07, P= 0. 013), and PLR (HR 1. 85, P= 0. 032) were significantly correlated with poor prognosis. As the biomarkers had internal correlations, only the CRP/Alb ratio was involved in the multivariate Cox analysis and remained an independent prognostic indicator. The study demonstrated that CRP/Alb ratio, GPS, and NLR were effective prognostic indicators for patients with Ewing sarcoma, and the CRP/Alb ratio was the most robust prognostic indicator with a discriminatory ability superior to that of the other indicators; however, PLR, LMR, and NPS may not be suitable as prognostic indicators in Ewing sarcoma.

CKD was defined as glomerular filtration rate(GFR) less than 60 ml/min per 1. 73 m(2) (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation) or urine <b>albumin</b> <b>to</b> creatinine <b>ratio</b> of at least 2. 5 mg/mmol in men and of at least 3. 5 mg/mmol in women or both. Results Among 3534 study patients (mean age 61 years, 54 % male patients, 37 % diabetic patients), the prevalence of microalbuminuria, reduced GFR, and CKD was 27, 26, and 42 %, respectively. Only 11 % of patients had concomitant microalbuminuria and reduced GFR. Sex, smoking, systolic blood pressure, glucose, and GFR were the independent predictors of <b>albumin</b> <b>to</b> creatinine <b>ratio,</b> whereas sex, age, history of cardiovascular diseases, uric acid, abdominal obesity, and <b>albumin</b> <b>to</b> creatinine <b>ratio</b> were {{more closely related to}} GFR. The presence of CKD was associated with older age, smoking, higher systolic and pulse pressure levels, impaired fasting glucose, hyperuricemia, and previous cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, CKD was not only associated with a greater use of renin-angiotensin system-inhibiting, lipid-lowering and antiplatelet drugs but also with inadequate blood pressure control. Conclusion Renal abnormalities are found in a significant number of hypertensive patients. CKD occurs more often in older patients and in those with associated metabolic risk factors or clinical conditions. These results suggest the need to improve awareness of the role of renal damage as a component of global risk and to develop appropriate therapeutic strategies to reduce morbidity and mortality in this specific subgroup of patients.

(4) The rate of hit varied to a certain extent with the difference in the kind of diseases: it was satisfactorily high in the diseases of the liver and biliary tract, the lungs and, the blood and hematopoietic organs, especially in hepatitis, hepatic cancer, cancer of the biliary tract, and pulmonary tuberculosis, although it was relatively low in the diseases of the pancreas and the thyroid gland {{as well as in the}} paitients belonging to psychiatry, neurology and otolaryngokogy. Gastroduodenal ulcer, hypertension, entercolitis (including dysentery), cancer of the breast and diabetes mellitus were generally diagnosed by the blood spectrum as the more favorable than by the purely clinical examination; but liver cirrhosis, gastroduodenitis, thoracic empyema, peritonitis, uterine cancer, nephrosis, uremia, and pancreatic cancer were, on the contrary, showed a tendency to be judged as the severer than clinically. (5) The blood spectrum is considered to provid the clinical bichemist with a useful means of diagnosing the general condition, even though he is in the labboratory without any information on the clinical manifestations of the patients. However, it is not beyond criticism, particularly regarding the slight ailment. The assured fact that the group N, instead of L, connecting line was associated with a considerable number of moderately ill paitients, is an example.

40|$|In {{patients}} with diabetic nephropathy, lowering {{blood pressure and}} reducing proteinuria by over 30 % correlates with a slower progression to kidney failure. We compared two different angiotensin receptor-blockers in a double blind, prospective trial of 860 {{patients with}} type 2 diabetes whose blood pressure levels was over 130 / 80 mmHg or who were receiving antihypertensive medication(s) and who had a morning spot urinary protein to creatinine ratio of 700 or more. Patients were randomized to telmisartan (a highly lipophilic agent with a long half-life) or losartan (with low lipophilicity and short half-life). The primary endpoint was {{the difference in the}} urinary <b>albumin</b> <b>to</b> creatinine <b>ratio</b> between the groups at 52 weeks. The geometric coefficient of variation and the mean of the urinary <b>albumin</b> <b>to</b> creatinine <b>ratio</b> fell in both groups at 52 weeks but both were significantly greater for the telmisartan compared to the losartan cohort. Mean systolic blood pressure reductions were not significantly different between groups at trial end. We conclude that telmisartan is superior to losartan in reducing proteinuria in hypertensive patients with diabetic nephropathy, despite a similar reduction in blood pressure...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To assess (a) the {{prevalence}} of microalbuminuria in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, (b) the association between urinary albumin excretion and disease activity as estimated by the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C reactive protein (CRP), and (c) the association between urinary albumin excretion and treatment with antirheumatic drugs. METHODS [...] Sixty five patients with rheumatoid arthritis attending two rheumatology clinics were compared with 51 control subjects matched by age and sex. The controls consisted of 20 healthy subjects, 16 patients with osteoarthritis and 15 with non-articular rheumatism. Patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or evidence of previous renal disease were not included. Urinary albumin was assayed by immunoturbidimetry in random urine samples on two occasions within seven months. The results were expressed as the <b>ratio</b> of urinary <b>albumin</b> <b>to</b> urinary creatinine <b>ratio.</b> Disease activity was assessed by the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and CRP. A drug history for the year before entry to the study was obtained for each patient. RESULTS [...] Urinary <b>albumin</b> <b>to</b> creatinine <b>ratio</b> in patients with rheumatoid arthritis was significantly greater than in controls (p < 0. 01). Microalbuminuria (urinary <b>albumin</b> <b>to</b> creatinine <b>ratio</b> 3 - 30 mg/mmol in either or both urine samples) was present in 27. 7 % of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 7. 8 % of the control subjects. A significant relation was noted between urinary <b>albumin</b> <b>to</b> creatinine <b>ratio</b> and CRP, and the duration of disease. The number of patients treated with either gold or penicillamine was significantly greater in patients with microalbuminuria than in patients with normoalbuminuria. CONCLUSIONS [...] Microalbuminuria is frequently present in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Treatment with gold and penicillamine seems to {{increase the risk of}} developing microalbuminuria. Urinary albumin measured by immunochemical methods is a simple and sensitive test to detect early subclinical renal dysfunction and drug induced renal damage in rheumatoid arthritis. Urinary albumin excretion was found to be significantly correlated with CRP and may be a sensitive indicator of disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis...|$|R

Therefore, elevation of the blood urea nitrogen <b>to</b> serum <b>albumin</b> (B/A) <b>ratio</b> may identify patients with community-acquired pneumonia who are becoming critically ill. This study investigated the correlation between commonly used laboratory markers, in particular the B/A ratio, and clinical outcomes of community-acquired pneumonia. Methods: This observational study was performed in consecutive patients with community-acquired pneumonia admitted to our hospital {{over a period of}} one year. Blood counts, commonly used laboratory markers, microbiological tests, and calculation of Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) and CURB- 65 were done on admission. The endpoints were mortality within 28 days of admission and requirement for intensive care. Results: One hundred and seventy-five patients with community-acquired pneumonia were enrolled. Nineteen patients died within 28 days of admission and 29 patients required intensive care. Using multivariate analysis, independent factors associated with mortality were the requirement for intensive care (odds ratio [OR] 14. 96, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 3. 73 &ndash; 60. 03, P &lt; 0. 001), PSI class (OR 3. 55, 95 % CI 1. 08 &ndash; 11. 66, P = 0. 037), and B/A ratio (OR 1. 10, 95 % CI 1. 01 &ndash; 1. 20, P = 0. 037). Similarly, independent factors associated with need for intensive care were PSI class (OR 5. 35, 95 % CI 1. 90 &ndash; 15. 06, P = 0. 002), CURB- 65 (OR 2. 37, 95 % CI 1. 26 &ndash; 4. 45, P = 0. 007), and B/A ratio (OR 1. 27, 95 % CI 1. 09 &ndash; 1. 47, P = 0. 002).

The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the significance of the C-reactive protein <b>to</b> <b>albumin</b> (CRP/ALB) <b>ratio</b> in colorectal cancer patients who received palliative chemotherapy. We performed a retrospective review of 99 patients who underwent palliative chemotherapy for unresectable colorectal cancer between 2005 and 2010. The cutoff value of the CRP/ALB ratio was determined based on a receiver operating characteristics curve analysis. The relationship between the CRP/ALB ratio and survival was assessed. The cutoff value for the CRP/ALB ratio was 0.183. The high pretreatment CRP/ALB ratio group showed significantly worse overall survival. Patients with a high pretreatment CRP/ALB ratio and in whom the CRP/ALB ratio normalized after chemotherapy tended to have better overall survival than those in whom both the pretreatment and posttreatment CRP/ALB ratios were high. The CRP/ALB ratio is a useful marker for predicting survival and monitoring chemotherapeutic effectiveness in patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer.|$|R

Astragaloside IV was coupled to carrier proteins, bovine serum albumin and ovalbumin using the sodium periodate method and was then evaluated using SDS-PAGE, MALDI-TOF MS and animal immunizations. The coupling ratio of astragaloside IV <b>to</b> bovine serum <b>albumin</b> <b>ratio</b> was determined <b>to</b> be thirteen, and the indirect ELISA demonstrated that three groups of mice immunized with astragaloside IV-bovine serum albumin produced anti-astragaloside IV-bovine serum albumin-specific antibody, with a minimum serum titer of 1 : 9600. A method for synthesizing highly immunogenic astragaloside IV artificial antigens was successfully developed thus indicating its feasibility in the establishment of a fast immunoassay for astragaloside IV content determination in Radix astragali and its products...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundAlbumin to {{creatinine}} ratio (ACR) {{in random}} urine samples correlates well with 24 -h protein excretion in potential glomerulopathy as in diabetic renal microangiopathy. Using this ratio {{as an appropriate}} screening test for proteinuria or for the disease severity in hypertensive disorders with pregnancy needs still to be verified. ObjectiveTo investigate the role of <b>albumin</b> <b>to</b> creatinine <b>ratio</b> in a random urine sample for assessment of severity of preeclampsia. Patients & methodsTwo separate groups, fifty women each, were enrolled. All were pregnant at their third trimester with confirmed preeclampsia. Based on their blood pressure levels, Group A, included patients with mild form of preeclampsia, whereas group B included cases with severe form. <b>Albumin</b> <b>to</b> creatinine <b>ratio</b> in random urine samples and the 24 -h protein content in urine were assessed. ResultsACR and the 24 -h urine protein excretion were significantly correlated, (r= 0. 583, p< 0. 001). Cut-off value for ACR for this group of patients was calculated to be 14. 65 mg/mmol, above which severity of the disease is highly probable. The sensitivity and specificity were 100 % and 58. 0 %, respectively. The positive predictive value was 70. 4 % and negative predictive value was 100 %. ConclusionsRandom urine ACR may be a reliable method for prediction and assessment of severity of preeclampsia. Using the estimated cut-off may add to the predictive value of such a simple quick test...|$|R
40|$|Tubulointerstitial disease {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the pathophysiology of diabetic kidney disease. To determine whether biomarkers of tubular injury could predict renal outcome and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes, we measured urinary levels of kidney injury molecule- 1 (KIM- 1) and glycoprotein non-metastatic melanoma B (Gpnmb), both normalized to the urinary creatinine, in 978 individuals from the Edinburgh Type 2 Diabetes Study. At baseline, 238 patients had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 60 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2 while 147 and 15 patients had microalbuminuria or overt proteinuria, respectively. Both the urine KIM- 1 and Gpnmb to creatinine ratios correlated with the urinary <b>albumin</b> <b>to</b> creatinine <b>ratio,</b> the duration of diabetes, and the stringency of glycemic control but not with blood pressure or baseline eGFR. Higher ratios of each marker were associated with a faster decline in kidney function during 4 years of follow-up; however, this was not independent of the urinary <b>albumin</b> <b>to</b> creatinine <b>ratio.</b> Higher KIM- 1, but not Gpnmb ratios were associated with an increased risk of mortality, but this association was no longer significant after adjustment for other risk factors, in particular albuminuria. Thus, tubular injury in persons with type 2 diabetes may contribute to the decline in kidney function; however, measuring the urinary concentration of these two tubular biomarkers does not confer additional prognostic information beyond established risk factors...|$|R
40|$|CSF {{abnormalities}} {{have been}} reported in CSF leakage syndrome. However, the mechanism for these CSF changes is actually unknown and they may indicate impaired CSF flow or blood-CSF barrier. Angiopoietin- 2 (Ang- 2), a protein which is expressed and released by endothelial cells, has been associated with increased vascular permeability. In the assumption that CSF changes are due to an impaired blood-CSF barrier, we hypothesized that subjects with persistent CSF leakage may have increased CSF Ang- 2 levels. We enrolled 10 subjects with a clinically definite diagnosis of persisting CSF leakage syndrome and 10 control subjects. In CSF analyses, CSF <b>to</b> serum <b>albumin</b> <b>ratio</b> (Qalb) was the most frequently increased parameter indicating a disturbed blood-CSF barrier function. Comparison of the mean CSF Ang- 2 levels, CSF to serum Ang- 2 ratio (QAng- 2), and QAng- 2 /Qalb between the control and CSF leakage patients did not show any significant difference. We suggest that the increase of Qalb results from a low CSF flow. Future studies with phase contrast-MRI in conjunction with CSF analyses before and after epidural blood patch treatment are required to address this question. It would be of particular interest whether Qalb {{can be used as a}} marker for successful nontargeted epidural blood patch treatment...|$|R
40|$|A high {{sensitivity}} C-reactive protein <b>to</b> <b>albumin</b> <b>ratio</b> (hs-CRP/Alb) predicts {{mortality risk}} {{in patients with}} acute kidney injury. However, it varies dynamically. This {{study was conducted to}} evaluate whether a variation of this marker was associated with long-term outcome in clinically stable hemodialysis (HD) patients. hs-CRP/Alb was checked bimonthly in 284 clinically stable HD outpatients throughout all of 2008. Based on the "slope" of trend equation derived from 5 - 6 hs-CRP/alb ratios for each patient, the total number of patients was divided into quartiles [...] Group 1 : β≦ - 0. 13, n = 71; group 2 : β>- 0. 13 ≦ 0. 003; n = 71, group 3 : β> 0. 003 ≦ 0. 20; and group 4 : β> 0. 20, n = 71. The observation period was from January 1, 2009 to August 31, 2012. Group 1 + 4 showed a worse long-term survival (p = 0. 04) and a longer 5 -year hospitalization stay than Group 2 + 3 (38. 7 ± 44. 4 vs. 16. 7 ± 22. 4 days, p< 0. 001). Group 1 + 4 were associated with older age (OR = 1. 03, 95 % CI = 1. 01 - 1. 05) and a high prevalence of congestive heart failure (OR = 2. 02, 95 % CI = 1. 00 - 4. 11). Standard deviation (SD) of hs-CRP/Alb was associated with male sex (β = 0. 17, p = 0. 003), higher Davies co-morbidity score (β = 0. 16, p = 0. 03), and baseline hs-CRP (β = 0. 39, p< 0. 001). Patients with lower baseline and stable trend of hs-CRP/Alb had a better prognosis. By multivariate Cox proportional methods, SD of hs-CRP/alb (HR: 1. 05, 95 % CI: 1. 01 - 1. 08) rather than baseline hs-CRP/Alb was an independent predictive factor for long-term mortality after adjusting for sex and HD vintage.
