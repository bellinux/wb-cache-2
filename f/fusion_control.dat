50|$|Jean Robieux is {{responsible}} for the discovery of the principle of control of laser fusion in 1961 and the discovery of the principle of laser isotope separation, and the creation of elementary particles by laser. All contributions are outlined in his book « High Power Laser Interactions : Isotopes Separation - Nuclear <b>Fusion</b> <b>Control</b> - Elementary Particles Selective Creation ». He obtained the realization of a neodymium-doped laser emitting 500 joules in 30 ns, 30 times more powerful than lasers built in the world at that time.He carries out experiments to demonstrate the principle possibility of issuing average powers exceeding 1 MW. They open the way for the laser weapon in 1967. Using a laser made by the research center in Marcoussis, CEA Limeil produced in 1969 {{for the first time ever}} in a reproducible, neutrons during the interaction laser / material, he allows then to pave the way towards the control of fusion. Today, Jean Robieux is involved in research on laser fusion.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA new hybrid {{control scheme}} is {{presented}} with a robust multiple model <b>fusion</b> <b>control</b> (RMMFC) law for a UH- 60 helicopter and an active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) controller for its engines. This scheme is a control design method with every subsystem designed separately but fully considering the couplings between them. With three subspaces with respect to forward flight velocity, a RMMFC is proposed to devise a four-loop reference signal tracing control for the helicopter, which escapes the closed-loop system from unstable state due to the extreme complexity of this integrated nonlinear system. The engines are controlled by the proposed ADRC decoupling controller, which fully takes advantage of a good compensation ability for unmodeled dynamics and extra disturbances, so as to compensate torque disturbance in power turbine speed loop. By simulating a forward acceleration flight task, the RMMFC for the helicopter is validated. It is apparent that the integrated helicopter and engine system (IHES) has much better dynamic performance under the new control scheme. Especially in the switching process, the large transient is significantly weakened, and smooth transition among candidate controllers is achieved. Over the entire simulation task, the droop of power turbine speed with the proposed ADRC controller is significantly slighter than with the conventional PID controller, and the response time of the former is much faster than the latter. By simulating a rapid climb and descent flight task, the results also show the feasibility {{for the application of}} the proposed multiple model <b>fusion</b> <b>control.</b> Although there is aggressive power demand in this maneuver, the droop of power turbine speed with an ADRC controller is smaller than using a PID controller. The control performance for helicopter and engine is enhanced by adopting this hybrid control scheme, and simulation results in other envelope state give proofs of robustness for this new scheme...|$|E

This paper {{presents}} and analyses {{a performance comparison}} between a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and Composite Nonlinear Feedback (CNF) controllers for an active anti-roll bar (ARB) system. The anti-roll bar system has to balance the trade-off involving ride comfort and handling performance.

The design model is validity and the performances of roll angle and roll rate under control of LQR and CNF controller are achieved by using simulation analysis.

40|$|Abstract—This paper proposes an {{alternative}} approach {{to address the problem}} of coordinating behaviors in mobile robot navigation: <b>fusion</b> of <b>control</b> signals. Such approach is based on a set of two decentralized information filters, which accomplish the data fusion involved. Besides these two <b>fusion</b> engines, <b>control</b> architectures designed according to this approach also embed a set of different controllers that generate reference signals for the robot linear and angular speeds. Such signals are delivered to the two decentralized information filters, which estimate suitable overall reference signals for the robot linear and angular speeds, respectively. Thus, the background for designing such control architectures is provided by the nonlinear systems theory, which makes this approach different from any other yet proposed. This background also allows checking control architectures designed according to the proposed approach for stability. Such analysis is carried out in the paper, and shows that the robot always reaches its final destination, in spite of either obstacles along its path or the environment layout. As an example, a control architecture is designed to guide a mobile robot in an experiment, whose results allows checking the good performance of the control architecture and validating the design approach proposed as well.
