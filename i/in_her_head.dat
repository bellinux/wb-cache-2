5|$|Although Tsukudani kept a {{notebook}} with story ideas, she admitted that {{on many occasions}} the theme of a chapter {{was born out of}} her own daydreams. Once she decided on a theme, she had the characters move around <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and then worked out the plot and storyboard. Since she had a solid grasp on who the characters were, she noted that they moved around for her on their own. Conversely, if the characters were stiff with a given theme, Tsukudani could not develop an interesting story and moved on to another idea. The theme developed for the manga serialized in Febri had to do with bonus aspects to the story that she was unable to draw in the main serialization, as well as events that occurred between chapters in the main story.|$|E
5|$|Olivia (Anna Torv) {{dreams that}} she pushes {{a woman in}} front of a subway train at Grand Central Terminal, but assumes it was just <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> In the morning however, the news reports that the woman killed herself with the train. Walter (John Noble) puts forth various theories, such as astral projection, while Peter (Joshua Jackson) thinks it was still just a dream. Olivia is unconvinced, and goes with the Fringe team to investigate. An NYPD officer (April Grace) escorts them to the crime scene, and Peter sees a red balloon {{floating}} and begins to believe her, as Olivia had described the balloon to him previously.|$|E
5|$|Schnauz escapes police custody {{by killing}} {{an officer and}} then robs the {{pharmacy}} from the opening, taking the passport photo camera, film, {{and an assortment of}} drug-related materials. While investigating the robbery, Scully is rendered unconscious and kidnapped by Schnauz. Mulder heads to the office where Schnauz's father used to work as a dentist, and finds the exam chair missing. Scully awakens bound to the chair with Schnauz claiming he's going to kill the howlers <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> Schnauz takes a photo of himself, the result of which greatly disturb him, then prepares to lobotomize Scully. Mulder, having found a clue in a photo of Scully from the drugstore's photo booth, finds a trailer in a cemetery and realizes it belongs to Schnauz. He manages to break in and shoot Schnauz in the nick of time. Mulder looks at the photo Schnauz took of himself, in which he is lying dead on the floor.|$|E

25|$|The {{handyman}} {{cleared up}} {{the question of the}} headless female corpse found in the ruins of Gunness' home. Gunness had lured this woman from Chicago on the pretense of hiring her as a housekeeper days before she decided to make her permanent escape from La Porte. According to Lamphere, Gunness had drugged the woman, then bashed <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and decapitated the body, taking the head, which had weights tied to it, to a swamp where she threw it into deep water. Then she chloroformed her children, smothered them to death, and dragged their bodies, along with the headless corpse, to the basement.|$|E
25|$|In The Janus Conjunction by Trevor Baxendale, Sam dies {{when she}} becomes {{poisoned}} by radiation {{on the planet}} Janus Prime. The Doctor puts the TARDIS into a temporal orbit, devises a serum, then returns to a time before she dies and administers the serum. In The Taint by Michael Collier, Sam and the Doctor meet Fitz Kreiner. In the same story, Sam also survives having an alien leech implanted <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> by a robot called Azoth, who notes Sam's special DNA, due to the Blonde Sam/Dark Sam duality. The Dark Sam storyline reaches its conclusion in Unnatural History by Jonathan Blum and Kate Orman.|$|E

In a comedy of errors, she is mistaken for a famous dancer, which results <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>heading</b> the cast of a star-studded musical. The plot acts as a backdrop for this musical revue film, which includes many German film, sports, and entertainment stars of the 1930s.|$|R

25|$|In late 1963, Jane Roberts and her husband, Robert Butts, {{experimented with}} a Ouija board {{as part of}} Roberts' {{research}} for a book on extra-sensory perception. Roberts and Butts claimed that they began to receive coherent messages from a male personality on December 2, 1963, who later identified himself as Seth. Soon after, Roberts reported that she was hearing the messages <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> She began to dictate the messages instead of using the Ouija board, and the board was eventually abandoned. For 21 years until Roberts' death in 1984 (with a one-year hiatus due to her final illness), Roberts held regular sessions in which she went into a trance and purportedly spoke on behalf of Seth.|$|E
25|$|Based on {{personal}} experience, Grandin advocates early intervention to address autism and supportive teachers, who can direct fixations {{of the child}} with autism in fruitful directions. She has described her hypersensitivity to noise and other sensory stimuli. She claims she is a primarily visual thinker and has said that words are her second language. Temple attributes her success as a humane livestock facility designer to her ability to recall detail, which is a characteristic of her visual memory. Grandin compares her memory to full-length movies <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> that may be replayed at will, allowing her to notice small details. She also is able to view her memories using slightly different contexts by changing {{the positions of the}} lighting and shadows.|$|E
25|$|Agnes, on {{the other}} hand, has a preprogrammed script <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> that {{contains}} all the social rules of conduct. She is easily embarrassed and uses most of her energies attempting to keep others from saying or doing things that go against her rules. In other words, she escapes the nasty or difficult parts of life by defining them as taboo subjects. Agnes hides from reality behind the rules. If the rules do not offer shelter, she then escapes reality through pure avoidance. She {{does not want to}} talk about things that are unpleasant, unless, of course, she is discussing her sister’s poor excuse for a life. She avoids her daughter’s temper tantrum, assuming that her daughter will eventually work things out on her own. Agnes, in the meantime, does not have time to deal with all those emotions. Even though she suspects that her husband had an affair, she only asks the people whom she knows will not confirm her suspicions.|$|E
60|$|Norgate {{leaned back}} in his place. His companion's little interjection, however, was irresistible. He glanced towards her.

25|$|Based on {{his initial}} {{confession}}, Riley, {{who was an}} adult over 18 (aged 20) {{at the time of}} the crime, was charged with two counts of first-degree murder for killing Jim and Naomi Olive and faced the death penalty. Under hypnosis, Riley later recanted the part of his initial confession about beating Naomi Olive with the hammer, saying that when he entered the house, he found Naomi Olive lying in bed, bleeding from head wounds and near death, with the hammer embedded <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> Riley thus implied that Marlene Olive (who had been using the hammer that morning to repair a platform shoe) had fatally beaten her mother with the hammer before leaving the house. Riley contended that he had stabbed and suffocated Naomi Olive because she was suffering and near death from the hammer attack, and he was trying to end her misery. He said that he initially confessed to killing Naomi Olive in order to protect Marlene Olive by taking the blame for her actions. Riley admitted shooting Jim Olive, but said he acted out of fear and self-defense as Jim had threatened to kill him.|$|E
500|$|When she awakes, {{she asks}} Dr. Cox if the surgery works, but Cox replies [...] "you're gonna {{have to tell}} us", and they take a step back; Ms. Miller {{realized}} that the surgery was a success, she no longer hears singing, and thanks Dr. Cox and the others. J.D. breaks the moment asking her who was the best singer <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> much {{to the rest of}} the staff's (and especially Dr. Cox's) dismay. J.D. reflects in voiceover that in musicals everyone get what they want, but in reality, after having made a choice we may miss the way things were; as Elliot realizes she misses her roommate, Carla realizes she wishes she spent more time with her daughter, and Ms. Miller realizes she misses the music <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E

500|$|According to Ildikó de Papp Carrington, Keats' wording, [...] "when, {{sick for}} home, / She stood in tears amid the alien corn", {{seems to be}} echoed in by Alice Munro's Save the Reaper (1998), {{the end of which}} reads: [...] "Eve would lie down [...] with nothing <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> but the rustle of the deep tall corn which might have stopped growing now but still made its live noise after dark" [...] (book version).|$|E
500|$|... "Breathe" [...] {{is about}} contemplation and holding back emotions. The lyrics {{were written by}} Minogue in Tokyo during her trips with her boyfriend, Stéphane Sednaoui, in late 1995. She {{explained}} the idea came to mind when her friends were worried about her being silent: [...] "My girlfriend told me 'You don't realize how loud you are when you are quiet'." [...] She {{felt that it was}} [...] "typical" [...] of her to be thinking and [...] "deciding what was wrong" [...] because she felt that things <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> [...] "were not clear." ...|$|E
500|$|Sherwood {{was born}} on 6 May 1775, in Stanford-on-Teme, Worcestershire, as the eldest {{daughter}} and second child of Martha Butt and Reverend George Butt, the chaplain in ordinary to George III.

500|$|As Tubman aged, the seizures, headaches, and {{suffering}} from her childhood head trauma continued to plague her. At {{some point in}} the late 1890s, she underwent brain surgery at Boston's Massachusetts General Hospital. Unable to sleep because of pains and [...] "buzzing" [...] <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> she asked a doctor if he could operate. He agreed and, in her words, [...] "sawed open my skull, and raised it up, and now it feels more comfortable". She had received no anesthesia for the procedure and reportedly chose instead to bite down on a bullet, as she had seen Civil War soldiers do when their limbs were amputated.|$|E
500|$|... "Telephone"'s lyrics {{relate to}} the singer preferring the dance floor to {{answering}} someone's call. She further tells her lover that she left her head and her heart on the dance floor. [...] The verses are sung in a rapid-fire way, accompanied by double beats. According to Gaga, the phone addressed in the lyrics of the song {{is not just a}} physical phone, but also a person <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> telling her to keep working harder and harder. Gaga explained, [...] "That's my fear—that the phone's ringing and my head's ringing,... Whether it's a telephone or it's just the thoughts in your head, that's another fear." ...|$|E
500|$|Inspired by the {{cinematography}} of Leaving Las Vegas, {{the music}} video for [...] "Everytime" [...] portrays Spears {{as a star}} hounded by paparazzi, who drowns in her bathtub when she starts bleeding from a wound <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> In the hospital, doctors fail to resuscitate her while a child is born in the next room, implying she has been reincarnated. The original treatment would have had Spears killing herself from a drug overdose, but the plot was removed after it received criticism by organizations such as Kidscape, who perceived it as a glamorization of suicide. Critics noted the video for its religious references to The Passion of the Christ, Kabbalah and stigmata, and for predicting Spears's future struggles with fame.|$|E
