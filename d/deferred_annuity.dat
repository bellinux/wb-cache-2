6000|$|When I went to Mr. Longman with my next novel, The Three Clerks, in my hand, I {{could not}} induce him to {{understand}} that a lump sum down was more pleasant than a <b>deferred</b> <b>annuity.</b> I wished him to buy it from me at a price which he might think to be a fair value, and I argued with him {{that as soon as}} an author has put himself into a position which insures a sufficient sale of his works to give a profit, the publisher is not entitled to expect the half of such proceeds. While there is a pecuniary risk, the whole of which must be borne by the publisher, such division is fair enough; but such a demand {{on the part of the}} publisher is monstrous as soon as the article produced is known to be a marketable commodity. I thought that I had now reached that point, but Mr. Longman did not agree with me. And he endeavoured to convince me that I might lose more than I gained, even though I should get more money by going elsewhere. [...] "It is for you," [...] said he, [...] "to think whether our names on your title-page are not worth more to you than the increased payment." [...] This seemed to me to savour of that high-flown doctrine of the contempt of money which I have never admired. I did think much of Messrs. Longman's name, but I liked it best at the bottom of a cheque.|$|E
