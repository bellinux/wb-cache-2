But <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was my style that made a difference—it was the content. I wasn't a great communicator, but I communicated great things." [...] His age and soft-spoken speech gave him a warm grandfatherly image.|$|E
500|$|A similar {{problem of}} {{interpretation}} has also plagued Narihira's last poem (quoted above). The fourth line, , is most normally read as [...] "(I never thought) {{that it might}} be yesterday or today", but has been occasionally interpreted by scholars to mean [...] "until yesterday <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> might be today"; others take it as simply meaning [...] "right about now". But the emotion behind the poem is nonetheless clear: Narihira, who died in his fifties, always knew he must die someday, but is nonetheless shocked that his time has come so soon.|$|E
500|$|Shatner {{referred}} to The Original Series as [...] "cartoonish" [...] in Mind Meld, but later, upon questioning by a reporter, said, [...] "I {{never thought it}} was a cartoon ... <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was beneath me." [...] In a February 2002 interview on Larry King Live, Shatner said Mind Meld was similar to My Dinner with Andre, and indicated that he and Nimoy were hoping to produce more films of a similar nature. Nimoy said of the film, [...] "This is the most personal insight the fans will get into our relationship and into aspects of Bill and myself they've never heard before." [...] In April 2002, Mind Meld was screened at the Newport Beach Film Festival. Two years later, Mind Meld was included in the bonus material when the first six Star Trek films were re-released as a special edition box set.|$|E

500|$|Bieber {{begins his}} verse {{approximately}} {{one minute and}} forty-five seconds in, singing the new lyrics [...] "It’s like every time you call me/ You know I can’t leave you lonely/ 'Cause I was always there when you need/ You said that you'd be there 'til the end/ What must I say/ <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would happen this way oh/ But I can tell if you're gone again/ got my number… things til the end.” Followed by another chorus and a verse by T.I., the song ends with a fade. A reviewer for the Inquisitor praised the collaboration, however Idolator's Christina Lee was critical of the remix, writing [...] "Two of them don’t sound like grown men — and they get the longer verses. French’s loopy rapping and off-key warbling is incoherent. Justin’s attempts to sound pained just sounds whiny." [...] It {{is the second time}} that Carey and Bieber have collaborated, the first being when the two re-recorded Carey's 1994 song [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You" [...] for Bieber's 2011 Christmas album Under the Mistletoe.|$|E

After alighting from his car, Dupas followed the woman and attacked her, holding {{her to the ground}} at knifepoint before raping her. He later told police: [...] "I'm sorry for what happened. Everyone was telling me I'm OK now. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was going to happen again. I only wanted to live a normal life." ...|$|E

The song also reached number one in Belgium. He was awarded a gold disc at the Cannes Midem Awards. As the first artist of Turkish origin to sell 500,000 albums in France, in an interview for CNN he said: [...] "It feels wild, you know, because in the beginning <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was going to really happen. It's all in Turkish, you know, and nobody understands a word. But I think it's a groove. It's the kisses that are universal." ...|$|E
2500|$|Oberman {{described}} her time on EastEnders as [...] "hectic", leading her to depart the show during December 2005. However, {{the role of}} Chrissie has remained a defining point of her career. In a recent interview, Oberman remarked: [...] "Chrissie was such a wonderful character and the show was watched by so many people, especially the murder of Den, that it opened up doors that <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would. I had some fantastic offers when I left, there was film and theatre... it was wonderful for me; EastEnders {{is a very good}} calling card." [...] Oberman has also recently declared her willingness to return to the part of Chrissie and EastEnders, even if only to provide a resolution for the character.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2008, it was {{announced}} that Lords had been cast in Kevin Smith's comedy Zack and Miri Make a Porno (2008). She said that at first she wanted to refuse but changed her mind after reading the script. [...] "It was really great that in taking the movie, because I didn't plan on going back to work right away, but I was dying to work with Kevin. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would be on something called Zack and Miri Make a Porno. What? So I went and I read the script at his house and I was prepared to say no. I thought I have the perfect out. I just had a kid. No one is going to blame me if I say I just can't do this right now. But it made me laugh out loud and it made me just literally cry. It was just funny." [...] Initially, Lords had a topless scene in the movie, but refused since she would breastfeed in between the takes. Katie Morgan, another former pornographic actress, also appeared in the film.|$|E
