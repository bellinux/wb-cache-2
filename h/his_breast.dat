5|$|If a male is interested, he will stretch {{his neck}} and erect his feathers, then bend over and peck at the ground. He will circle around and sidle up to the female, swaying his body and neck from side to side, and rubbing <b>his</b> <b>breast</b> against his partner's rump. Often the female will reject his {{advances}} with aggression, but if amenable, she signals acceptance by squatting down and raising her rump.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} a relief company, from the 1st Battalion of the Kumaon Regiment, reached Badgam, the {{position}} held by Sharma's company had been overrun. However, the 200 casualties suffered by the tribal infiltrators caused them to lose the impetus to advance. This bought time for Indian forces to fly into Srinagar airfield and block all routes of ingress to Srinagar itself. During the battle, along with Sharma, one junior commissioned officer and 20 other ranks of D company were killed. Sharma's body was recovered three days later. Though it was disfigured beyond recognition, his body was identified {{by means of the}} leather holster of his pistol and a few pages of Bhagavad Gita in <b>his</b> <b>breast</b> pocket.|$|E

25|$|The {{treaties}} of 1815 stirred him up up {{like some}} personal offence. He hated Wellington with a straightforward hate that pleased the masses; and for seventeen years, scarcely {{paying any attention}} to intermediate events, he had magnificently maintained his sadness over Waterloo. In his death throes, at his final hour, he had hugged to <b>his</b> <b>breast</b> a sword that the officers of the Hundred Days had presented to him.

25|$|He was an Indian {{with a white}} man's {{spirit of}} hatred and revenge {{for those who had}} wronged him and his. In his day he saw his son and his tribe {{gradually}} driven from their possessions: forced to give up their old hunting grounds and espouse the hard working and uncongenial avocations of the whites. And these, his conquerors, were marked in their dealings with his people by selfishness, falsehood and treachery. What wonder that his wild nature, untamed by years of subjection, should still revolt? What wonder that a fiery rage still burned within <b>his</b> <b>breast</b> and that he should seek every opportunity of obtaining vengeance upon his natural enemies.|$|E

500|$|In the mid-ground, the Archangel Michael's armour {{is heavily}} inscribed with esoteric and often {{difficult}} to source phrases.

The meaning of this phrase has not been conclusively identified; some art historians believe it contains misspellings and has been misread. Friedländer transcribed the first word as ADORAVI while the final word AGLA is thought be taken from the first four letters of the Hebrew words for [...] "Thou Art Mighty", and thus may signify God; the word also appears in a floor tile in the Ghent Altarpiece. In the upper portion, gilded inscriptions running vertically across the edges of Christ's mantle read VENITE BENEDICTI PATRIS MEI ("Come, ye blessed of my father").|$|E
500|$|Hopley's trial {{took place}} at Lewes Assizes on 23 July 1860. The {{prosecutors}} were Parry and Knapp; Hopley was defended by the serjeant-at-law William Ballantine, who subsequently described Hopley as [...] "distorted". Throughout his trial, Hopley described himself as reluctant to use corporal punishment. In describing the events preceding Cancellor's death, Hopley stated that he started crying while beating Cancellor, after which Cancellor presented his lesson and [...] "Hopley took his head on <b>his</b> <b>breast</b> and prayed with him". Hopley presented testimonials from past students who described him as [...] "kindly" [...] and who noted an infrequent use of violence.

He argued that, through the application of this theory, the beating that killed Cancellor had been a necessary one.|$|E
