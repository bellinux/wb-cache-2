40|$|The {{applicability}} of the <b>inhalable</b> <b>convention</b> for sampling aerosols relies on its being a valid model for typical sampling environments. The current convention is based on measurements carried out in external wind speeds between 1 and 4 m • s~'. However these measurements show a degree of wind speed dependence, and it is uncertain at present how valid the convention is for describing human aspiration efficiency outside these wind speed limits. Following concerns that wind speeds in many indoor workplaces may be significantly below this range, measurements {{have been made in}} 55 work areas covering a wide range of workplaces. Measurements have concentrated on 'background ' wind speeds where Hie influence of specific air movement sources is minimised. The pooled wind speed measurements show a highly skewed distribution with an arithmetic mean of approximately 0. 3 m*s '. Approximately 85 % of all individual measurements were below this mean value. No obvious correlation was found between wind speed distribution parameters and industry type, room size or ventilation type. A limited number of comparisons were made between static anemometers and devices mounted on workers. It was found that modal wind speeds experience by workers were typically 0. 05 m-s~ ' higher than those measured using a static anemometer. These measurements agreed well with previously published data for similar work-places as well as housesJCrown copyright © 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf of British Occupational Hygiene Society...|$|E
40|$|The need to {{determine}} occupational exposure to bioaerosols has notably increased in the past decade, especially for microbiology-related workplaces and laboratories. Recently, two new cyclone-based personal bioaerosol samplers were developed by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the USA and the Research Center for Toxicology and Hygienic Regulation of Biopreparations (RCT & HRB) in Russia to monitor bioaerosol exposure in the workplace. Here, a series of wind tunnel experiments were carried out to evaluate the physical sampling performance of these two samplers in moving air conditions, which could provide information for personal biological monitoring in a moving air environment. The experiments were conducted in a small wind tunnel facility using three wind speeds (0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 0 m s(- 1)) and three sampling orientations (020, 9020, and 18020) {{with respect to the}} wind direction. Monodispersed particles ranging from 0. 5 to 10 were employed as the test aerosols. The evaluation of the physical sampling performance was focused on the aspiration efficiency and capture efficiency of the two samplers. The test results showed that the orientation-averaged aspiration efficiencies of the two samplers closely agreed with the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) <b>inhalable</b> <b>convention</b> within the particle sizes used in the evaluation tests, and the effect of the wind speed on the aspiration efficiency was found negligible. The capture efficiencies of these two samplers ranged from 70...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{recommendations}} for wood dust sampling include sampling {{according to the}} <b>inhalable</b> <b>convention</b> of International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 7708 (1995) Air quality [...] particle size fraction definitions for health-related sampling. However, a specific sampling device is not mandated, and while several samplers have laboratory performance approaching theoretical for an 'inhalable' sampler, the best choice of sampler for wood dust is not clear. A side-by-side field study was considered the most practical test of samplers as laboratory performance tests consider overall performance based on {{a wider range of}} particle sizes than are commonly encountered in the wood products industry. Seven companies in the wood products industry of the Southeast USA (MS, KY, AL, and WV) participated in this study. The products included hardwood flooring, engineered hardwood flooring, door skins, shutter blinds, kitchen cabinets, plywood, and veneer. The samplers selected were 37 -mm closed-face cassette with ACCU-CAP 22 ̆ 01 e 2, Button, CIP 10 -I, GSP, and Institute of Occupational Medicine. Approximately 30 of each possible pairwise combination of samplers were collected as personal sample sets. Paired samplers of the same type were used to calculate environmental variance that was then used to determine the number of pairs of samples necessary to detect any difference at a specified level of confidence. Total valid sample number was 888 (444 valid pairs). The mass concentration of wood dust ranged from 0. 02 to 195 mg m(- 3). Geometric mean (geometric standard deviation) and arithmetic mean (standard deviation) of wood dust were 0. 98 mg m(- 3) (3. 06) and 2. 12 mg m(- 3) (7. 74), respectively. One percent of the samples exceeded 15 mg m(- 3), 6...|$|E
40|$|The {{assessment}} of personal inhalable aerosol samplers {{in a controlled}} laboratory setting has not previously been carried out at the ultra-low wind speed conditions that represent most modern workplaces. There is currently some concern about whether the existing <b>inhalable</b> aerosol <b>convention</b> is appropriate at these low wind speeds and an alternative has been sug-gested. It was therefore important to assess {{the performance of the}} most common personal samplers used to collect the inhalable aerosol fraction, especially those that were designed to match the original curve. The experimental set-up involved use of a hybrid ultra-low speed wind tunnel/calm air chamber and a rotating, heating, breathing mannequin to measure the inhalable fraction of aerosol exposure. The samplers that were tested included the Institute of Occupational Medicine (IOM), Button, and GSP inhalable samplers as well as the closed-face cassette sampler that has been (and still is) widely used by occupational hygienists in many countries. The results showed that, down to 0. 2 m s 21, the samplers matched the current in-halability criterion relatively well but were significantly greater than this at the lowest wind speed tested. Overall, there was a significant effect of wind speed on sampling efficiency, with lower wind speeds clearly associated with an increase in sampling efficiency...|$|R
40|$|A {{field study}} {{was carried out}} in order to derive a factor for the {{conversion}} of historic worker exposure data on airborne beryllium (Be) obtained by sampling according to the 37 -mm closed faced filter cassette (CFC) 'total' particulate method into exposure concentration values to be expected when sampling using the 'Gesamtstaubprobenahmesystem' (GSP) <b>inhalable</b> sampling <b>convention.</b> Workplaces selected to represent the different copper Be work processing operations that typically occur in Germany and the EU were monitored revealing a broad spectrum of prevailing Be size distributions. In total, 39 personal samples were taken using a 37 -mm CFC and a GSP worn side by side for simultaneous collection of the 'total' dust and the inhalable particulates, respectively. In addition, 20 static general area measurements were carried out using GSP, CFC, and Respicon samplers in parallel, the latter one providing information on the extra-thoracic fraction of the workplace aerosol. The study showed that there is a linear relationship between the concentrations measured with the CFC and those measured with the GSP sampler. The geometric mean value of the ratios of time-weighted average concentrations determined from GSP and CFC samples of all personal samples was 2. 88. The individual values covered a range between 1 and 17 related to differences in size distributions of the Be-containing particulates. This was supported by the area measurements showing that the conversion factor increases with increasing values of the extra-thoracic fraction covering a range between 0 and 79 %...|$|R
40|$|International {{standards}} establish {{criteria for}} size-selective aerosol sampling for industrial hygiene. Commercially available aerosol samplers {{are designed to}} conform to these criteria. This study uses semi-monodispersed aerosols generated in a vertically aligned test chamber to compare the performance of three commercially available respirable dust samplers, one of which can, in addition, simultaneously sample for thoracic and inhalable dust fractions. Comparison methods are used to calculate a theoretical fractional value based on the appropriate sampling conventions of the total dust concentration and size distribution of test materials. Performance of actual samplers can be conducted by comparing observed results to the theoretical value. Results show {{the design of the}} test chamber and use of fused aluminum oxide is appropriate to conduct simplified performance verification tests for inhalable and respirable dust samplers. This study showed the TSI RespiCon followed the <b>inhalable</b> and respirable <b>conventions</b> closely, but results for the thoracic fraction required the use of a correction factor. The SKC aluminum cyclone tended to undersample the respirable fraction, while the BGI CAS 4 cyclone and the TSI RespiCon appear to most closely follow the convention. Improved selection of test material and characterization of particle sizes are recommended to further develop this method of performance verification...|$|R
40|$|Occupational {{exposure}} {{limits are}} generally decreasing and traditional samplers used for quantifying occupational exposures have numerous limitations: cost, disposability, detection of low concentrations, {{and some even}} fail to match international <b>inhalable</b> sampling <b>conventions.</b> A low cost, high-flow (10 L min- 1) inhalable prototype sampler was developed from the 37 -mm cassette and tested in previous studies. These studies called for additional field testing as an area and personal sampler. The sampler was paired with the IOM (2 L min- 1), a traditional inhalable air sampler, and deployed in metal working facilities. The samplers were compared {{to determine whether the}} prototype matched the IOM and whether the new sampler could improve the sensitivity for detecting lower concentrations of metals. The following processes were sampled: welding, grinding, soldering, pouring, sawing, tending and shooting guns. A total of 21 out of 28 paired samples had detectable metals out of 15 possible metals. There were seven out of eight personal samples and 14 out of 20 area samples with detectable metal concentrations. The average sample time was seven hours, but ranged from 4. 2 – 8. 3 hours. The most common metals that were detected on 10 or more samples were iron, manganese, zinc, copper, and lead. Metal concentrations collected by the two samplers were not statistically different for the aggregate metal concentrations collected (p = 0. 67), metals collected by sample type, personal or area (p = 0. 52) or by particle “sizes,” small or large (p = 0. 40), collected from the processes. While the samplers were not statistically different, linear regression equations to assess the sampler relationships showed that there were {{significant differences between the two}} samplers. Over the total metal concentrations collected, the prototype collected about 71 % of what the IOM collected. By sample type, the prototype performed better during area sampling as opposed to personal sampling and by particle size, the prototype performed better in the collection of smaller, heat generated particles, as opposed to larger, mechanically generated particles. Though minor differences were found between concentrations detected on the prototype and IOM, it was determined that in general, these differences were negligible in their interpretation and comparison to occupational exposure limits. Plots also indicated that the prototype sampler performs well at sampling low concentrations of metals, however, only a small amount of metals were detected on the prototype that were not found on the IOM, therefore, the improvement of sensitivity was not assessed. High-flow sampling was hindered by the ability of air sampling pumps to maintain the required operation flow rate of 10 L min- 1 for the duration of a work shift. Additional field studies are needed to determine whether the sensitivity for detecting lower concentrations of metals can be improved...|$|R
40|$|Summary Kruse K & Eduard W. Sampling of inhalable flour dust. Arbete och Hälsa, 2009; 43 (5) In 2000 the Norwegian Labour Inspection Authority {{established}} an {{occupational exposure limit}} (OEL) for inhalable flour dust at 3 mg/m³. This is the first OEL in Norway to define inhalable dust instead of total dust. Because of inconsistencies between wind tunnel experiments and field studies a comparative study of aerosol samplers was performed in bakeries. Four inhalable samplers (PAS 6, IOM, GSP and Button) and a 25 mm standard aerosol cassette (StK) {{were included in the}} study. Initial results with the Button sampler showed that the holes in the screen became clogged and this cassette was therefore excluded. Personal measurements were carried out in pairs with PAS 6 as reference in a large and a small bakery. The samplers were attached on each shoulder and their position interchanged between measurements. The sampling was done for approximately 1 - 1 ½ h. Dust was collected on 2 μm Teflon filters which were analysed by gravimetry. SAC underestimated the exposure level compared to PAS 6 (STK = 0, 67 ⋅PAS 60. 95, r 2 = 0. 90, n = 25). GSP estimated higher exposure levels than PAS 6 (GSP = 1, 4 ⋅PAS 60. 92, r 2 = 0. 87, n = 27), while IOM estimated even higher dust levels especially for lower exposure levels as the power of PAS 6 was significantly lower than 1 (IOM= 2, 4 ⋅PAS 60. 71, r 2 = 0. 80, n = 27). The precision of the GSP and IOM was probably inferior to PAS 6 and SAC because the ratios GSP/PAS 6 and IOM/PAS 6 had 3 - 4 times higher standard deviations than SAC/PAS 6 (p<< 0. 001). The ranking of the other aerosol samplers was in agreement with earlier laboratory tests in wind tunnel. Laboratory tests have shown that the GSP sampler had the best fit to the <b>inhalable</b> CEN/ISO <b>convention</b> at en air velocity of 0. 5 m/s. This convention assumes, however, that the exposure level is independent {{from the direction of the}} air stream. This assumption seems unrealistic for bakers who often have the dust source in front of them. Furthermore, a larger aerosol fraction is inhalable at air velocities that are more realistic for indoor air (0. 1 - 0. 3 m/s) than used in laboratory tests. The best estimate for inhalable dust sampling in bakeries seems therefore to lie between the GSP and the PAS 6. The larger variability of GSP measurements and its need for a more powerful sampling pump (3. 5 l/min) favour the use of PAS 6 for sampling of inhalable flour dust. Because of considerable uncertainty about criteria for sampling of inhalableaerosol a valid alternative is to use those cassettes that were applied in key studies in the occupational exposure limit documentation. Then the PAS 6 cassette should be used in Norway and the IOM cassette in Sweden. A consequence of a pragmatic choice of sampling cassette is, however, that an approximately 80 % higher flour dust exposure level would be accepted in Norway than in Sweden even though the occupational exposure limit values are the same in the two countries...|$|R
