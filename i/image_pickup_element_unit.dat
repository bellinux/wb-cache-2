Results from the analysis of <b>pickup</b> <b>elements</b> are presented in a graphical form allowing comparison with a conventional (‘original’) pickup. The pickups were examined in unipolar and bipolar ICPT systems. Unlike the existing pickup, the proposed configurations utilize two components of the magnetic flux density, and are characterized by high-power transfer ability as well as much better response to the misalignment problem. Some recommendations and possible means for further improvements for higher power efficiency are also put forward...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} obtaining {{electronic}} chroma signals {{with a single}} scanning-type image device is described. A color multiplexed light signal is produced using an arrangement of dichroic filter stripes. In the particular system described, a two layer filter is used to color modulate external light which is then detected by an <b>image</b> <b>pickup</b> tube. The resulting time division multiplexed electronic signal from the pickup tube is converted by a decoder into a green color signal, and a single red-blue multiplexed signal, which is demultiplexed to produce red and blue color signals. The three primary color signals can be encoded as standard NTSC color signals...|$|R

The application of neural-network technology, particularly the multi-layer perceptron algorithm, is proposed as an efficient alternative for electrode linearization. A process of supervised learning is initially used to determine the weighting coefficients, which are subsequently applied to the incoming electrode data. A non-linear layer, known as an activation layer, is responsible for the removal of saturation effects. Implementation of a perceptron in an FPGA-based software-defined radio (SDR) is presented, along with performance comparisons.

40|$|A new torque {{transducer}} {{with high}} overload capability and direct frequency output is reported. It employs the recently developed metallic triple-beam resonators with thick-film printed {{lead zirconate titanate}} (PZT) drive and <b>pickup</b> <b>elements.</b> The new torque transducer has been tested in a torque range of up to 20 Nm, resulting in a strain level of 400 microstrain on the measurement shaft surface and giving a large frequency-change output of 800 Hz. The strain level required by the new torque transducer can be much lower (~ 100 microstrain) than the level (~ 1800 microstrain) usually required by conventional metallic resistance-strain-gauge-based torque transducers, thus increasing the transducer overload capability by a large factor. Nevertheless, under such a low strain level, the new torque transducer can still output an adequately large frequency change of 200 Hz for measurement.

These cameras varied in design, with image quality improving significantly with each successive model. Two companies made these various camera systems: RCA and Westinghouse. Originally, these slow-scan television (SSTV) cameras, running at 10 frames-per-second (fps), produced only black-and-white pictures and first flew on the Apollo 7 mission in October 1968. A color camera — using a field-sequential color system — flew on the Apollo 10 mission in May 1969, and every mission after that. The Color Camera ran at the North American standard 30 fps. The cameras all used <b>image</b> <b>pickup</b> tubes that were initially fragile, as one was irreparably damaged during the live broadcast of the Apollo 12 mission's first moonwalk. Starting with the Apollo 15 mission, a more robust, damage-resistant camera was used on the lunar surface.
