Jaynes asserted that, until roughly the times written about in Homer's Iliad, humans did not generally have the self-awareness characteristic of consciousness as most people experience it today.

The aims of this {{research}} is to build CAIP systems on OMM operation which have an ability to measure workpiece automatically based on <b>drawing</b> <b>data</b> from design division at a machine. The flow of information between each part becomes important as the design of the <b>drawing</b> <b>data</b> from design division to production division or quality control. CAIP system (Computer Aided Inspection Planning) is expected to ensure the flow of drawing information to quality control without any changed even though the amount of data that a lot. CAIP system use early <b>drawing</b> <b>data</b> from the design division. The type of <b>drawing</b> <b>data</b> which is used by each CAD software is STEP <b>drawing</b> <b>data.</b> STEP data consists of products information such as surface geometry, line, point, and direction of the vector surface. The information {{that can be used to}} build a CAIP system is a feature. Therefore, a feature reconstruction process is necessary based on the data STEP geometry information. Feature types which is used in this study are a type of box primitive feature. A Probe, a measuring instrument, can be operated in CMM (Coordinate Measurement Machine) and CNC machine. A product measuring on CNC machine during or after machining process called OMM (On Machine Measurement) operation.

40|$|The {{macrofunction}} in Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) {{systems is}} executed {{based on the}} macrocode which is transformed {{by a series of}} operations input by the user. By the use of this function, operations which should be performed by the user can be simplified. Therefore, if the transformation from mechanical drawings to NC code can be changed directly into macrocode, NC machining can be achieved easily. In our study, a function for transforming macrocode from data of a CAD drawing to CAM data is developed. However, <b>drawing</b> <b>data</b> of a CAD system (CAD drawing) does not always coincide with <b>drawing</b> <b>data</b> of a CAM system (CAM drawing), because in a CAM system, restricted conditions, such as machining conditions, must be considered. Consequently, <b>drawing</b> <b>data</b> must be represented by a structure and function which include information about restricted conditions. Thus, the concept of the relationship between "master and servant" for expressing structure and function in an object model definitely is specifically incorporated. As a result, even in the case where structure and function are changed, the knowledge base can be consistently maintained. This paper describes representation of knowledge in the knowledge base and a method for generating a macro code using this knowledge base...|$|E
