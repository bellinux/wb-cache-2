5|$|In 1803, {{war with}} France {{appeared}} imminent once again. After some discussions, {{it was agreed}} to adapt the 16th-century keep to enable it to hold six 24-pounder (10.8kg) guns; the roof was vaulted and a central stone pillar was installed to run up through the building, work estimated {{at the time to}} be likely to cost £4,122. The historian Andrew Saunders likens the resulting building to the various Martello towers being constructed along the south coast at this time. It was proposed to build two temporary gun batteries to replace the 1795 emplacements, which had suffered from the salt air and decayed, but the plan was turned down in order to <b>focus</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> redevelopment of the keep. The work was carried out by a mixture of soldiers and civilian contractors and was completed by the end of 1806.|$|E
5|$|The woman, who is {{probably}} {{in her late}} teens or early twenties, is shown half-length and in three-quarters profile, set against a two-dimensional interior background of deep blue-green. The background is flat and lacks the attention to detail common in van der Weyden's devotional works. Like his contemporary Jan van Eyck (c.1395 – 1441), when working in portraiture, he used dark planes to <b>focus</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sitter. It was not until Hans Memling (c.1435–1494), a pupil of van der Weyden, that a Netherlandish artist set a portrait against an exterior or landscape. In this work the flat setting allows the viewer to settle on the woman's face and quiet self-possession. Van der Weyden reduces his focus to four basic features: the woman's headdress, dress, face and hands. The background has darkened with age; {{it is likely that}} the angles created by the sitter's hennin and dress were once much sharper.|$|E

25|$|At {{about the}} same time that Saunders was {{disseminating}} her theories and developing her hospice, in 1965, Swiss psychiatrist Elisabeth Kübler Ross also began to consider the social responses to terminal illness, which she found inadequate at the Chicago hospital where her American physician husband was employed. Her 1969 best-seller, On Death and Dying, was influential on how the medical profession responded to the terminally ill, and along with Saunders and other thanatology pioneers helped to <b>focus</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> types of care available to them.|$|E

500|$|In early 2000, {{the clock}} {{started to run}} {{backward}} because the national debt was actually decreasing. It showed a national debt of $5.7 billion and an individual family share of almost $74,000. With the original purpose of the clock being to highlight the rising debt, the reversal of the figures gave a mixed message, added {{to the fact that}} the display not being designed to properly run backward. In May 2000, it was reported that the clock was planned to be unplugged on September 7, 2000, what would have been Seymour Durst's 87th birthday. Douglas said that the decision to unplug the clock was made because [...] "it was put up to <b>focus</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> increasing national debt, and it's served its purpose." [...] In September, the clock was unplugged and covered with a red-white-and-blue curtain, with the national debt standing at roughly 5.7 trillion dollars. However, less than two years later in July 2002, the curtain was raised and the clock once again picked up tracking a rising debt, starting at 6.1 trillion dollars.|$|E
500|$|The Tory {{campaign}} {{opened at}} Massey Hall in Toronto on April 25, where Diefenbaker addressed {{a crowd of}} 2,600, about 200 short of capacity. At the Massey Hall rally, a large banner hung behind Diefenbaker, which {{did not mention the}} name of his party, but which instead stated, [...] "It's Time for a Diefenbaker Government." [...] The slogan, coined by Grosart, sought to blur Canadian memories of the old Tory party of Bennett and Drew and instead <b>focus</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> party's new leader. Posters for election rallies contained Diefenbaker's name in large type; only the small print contained the name of the party. When St. Laurent complained that the Tories were not campaigning under their own name, Grosart sent copies of the Prime Minister's remarks in a plain envelope to every Liberal candidate, and was gratified when they began inserting the allegation into their own speeches. According to Professor J. Murray Beck in his history of Canadian general elections, [...] "His political enemies were led to make the very point he was striving to drive home: Diefenbaker was, in effect, leading a new party, not an old one with a repellent image." [...] Grosart later stated that he structured the entire campaign around the personality of John Diefenbaker, and threw away the Tory party and its policies.|$|E
500|$|Hunt's {{pedestal}} design {{contains elements}} of classical architecture, including Doric portals, {{as well as}} some elements influenced by Aztec architecture. The large mass is fragmented with architectural detail, in order to <b>focus</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> statue. In form, it is a truncated pyramid, [...] square at the base and [...] at the top. The four sides are identical in appearance. Above the door on each side, there are ten disks upon which Bartholdi proposed to place the coats of arms of the states (between 1876 and 1889, there were 38 U.S. states), although this was not done. Above that, a balcony was placed on each side, framed by pillars. Bartholdi placed an observation platform {{near the top of the}} pedestal, above which the statue itself rises. According to author Louis Auchincloss, the pedestal [...] "craggily evokes the power of an ancient Europe over which rises the dominating figure of the Statue of Liberty". The committee hired former army General Charles Pomeroy Stone to oversee the construction work. Construction on the [...] foundation began in 1883, and the pedestal's cornerstone was laid in 1884. In Hunt's original conception, the pedestal was to have been made of solid granite. Financial concerns again forced him to revise his plans; the final design called for poured concrete walls, up to [...] thick, faced with granite blocks. This Stony Creek granite came from the Beattie Quarry in Branford, Connecticut. The concrete mass was the largest poured to that time.|$|E

The attempt of Mr Tatchell to <b>focus</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> role of the grand Mufti in Moscow, {{in the face of}} numerous attacks on gay rights in Eastern Europe, which overwhelmingly come from right-wing Christian and secular currents, is a clear example of an Islamaphobic campaign." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{dismissal}} caused widespread {{demonstrations in}} the northern provinces. Initially, the pro-Buddhist demonstrations in I Corps and Saigon were mild and orderly. However, the unrest steadily grew, as civil servants, disaffected military personnel, and the working under-class, in part upset with the economic problems, joined the anti-government demonstrations. At first, Prime Minister Kỳ {{tried to ignore the}} demonstrations and wait for them to peter out, and to do not fight the dissidents, so as to [...] "not to provide any martyrs". Thi was immensely popular in the Buddhist stronghold of Huế. A general strike had incapacitated 90% of Da Nang, the largest city in central Vietnam and the second biggest in the entire country. In Saigon, 10,000 attended a Buddhist rally to call for elections and civilian rule and the monks used Thi's dismissal to <b>focus</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> junta's rule.|$|E

Rosemont extends from the foot of Shuter's Hill, crowned by the George Washington National Masonic Memorial, away to the north for a dozen blocks to the edge of Del Ray. Originally intended as a [...] "streetcar suburb" [...] connected to Washington, D.C. and George Washington's home at Mount Vernon by electric railroad, Rosemont, instead, became closely integrated into the life of the core of Alexandria. Much of Rosemont is included in a historic district listed on the National Register of Historic Places that was intended to <b>focus</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> neighborhood's role as a showcase of early 20th century home building styles.

2500|$|Canonical {{criticism}} involves [...] "paying {{attention to}} the present form of the text in determining its meaning for the believing community." [...] According to James Barr, it involves concentrating authority [...] "in the canonical text, {{and not in the}} people or events out of which that text came." [...] Brevard Childs says that the canon [...] "not only serves to establish the outer boundaries of authoritative Scripture," [...] but [...] "forms a prism through which light from the different aspects of the Christian life is refracted." [...] He also notes that [...] "the tradents of the tradition have sought to hide their own footprints in order to <b>focus</b> <b>attention</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> canonical text itself and not on the process." [...] However, Childs refuses to speak of canonical criticism as if it were on a level with form criticism or redaction criticism. According to Childs, it represents an entirely new departure, replacing the entire historical-critical method.|$|E

2500|$|In 1912 Émile Durkheim {{identified}} {{society as}} the sole source of human logical thought. He argued in [...] "The Elementary Forms of Religious Life" [...] that society constitutes a higher intelligence because it transcends the individual over space and time. Other antecedents are Vladimir Vernadsky's concept of [...] "noosphere" [...] and H.G. Wells's concept of [...] "world brain" [...] (see also the term [...] "global brain"). Peter Russell, Elisabet Sahtouris, and Barbara Marx Hubbard (originator of the term [...] "conscious evolution") are inspired by the visions of a noosphere– a transcendent, rapidly evolving collective intelligence– an informational cortex of the planet. The notion has more recently been examined by the philosopher Pierre Lévy. In a 1962 research report, Douglas Engelbart linked collective intelligence to organizational effectiveness, and predicted that pro-actively 'augmenting human intellect' would yield a multiplier effect in group problem solving: [...] "Three people working together in this augmented mode [...] {{seem to be more}} than three times as effective in solving a complex problem as is one augmented person working alone".
