40|$|The {{study was}} aimed {{to examine whether}} {{attachment}} to parent, <b>empathy,</b> rumination, <b>and</b> forgivingness predict subjective well being of the Javanese adolescents. The study was conducted quantitatively. The respondents were Javanese undergraduate students (N= 65). Data was analyzed with multiple regression statistical analysis. The results showed that 36 % of life satisfaction was explained by attachment to parent, <b>empathy,</b> forgivingness, <b>and</b> rumination (R 2 = 0, 361). Attachment to parent, <b>empathy,</b> forgivingness, <b>and</b> rumination together affected life satisfaction significantly (F = 8, 466; p<O,OOI). Attachment to parent affected life satisfaction significantly (t= 3, 119, p< 0, 01) as well as rumination (t = - 2, 033, p<O, 05). It also found that 25, 7 % of positive affect was explained by attachment to parent, <b>empathy,</b> forgivingness, <b>and</b> rumination (R 2 = 0, 257). Attachment to parent, <b>empathy,</b> forgivingness, <b>and</b> rumination together significantly affected positive affect (F= 5, 181; p<O,OI).

40|$|The {{roles of}} shame and guilt, and their {{relationships}} to empathy, have not been modelled adequately as key factors in moral decision-making {{in the study of}} violence. This research will test the different roles of <b>empathy,</b> shame, <b>and</b> guilt in violence decision-making using a Situational Action Theory perspective. Qualitative in-depth interviews were carried out with a violent offender subsample taken from the longitudinal Peterborough Adolescent and Young Adult Development Study (PADS+) in order to explore the role of moral emotion in specific real-life violent events. In addition, quantitative questionnaire indices enable comparison of the violent offender subsample with the remaining PADS+ study sample. Persistent offenders report significantly lower levels of <b>empathy,</b> shame <b>and</b> guilt on the quantitative indices, <b>and</b> weak <b>empathy,</b> shame, <b>and</b> guilt in their detailed recollections of specific acts of violence, e. g., “there’s not much guilt involved in the whole situation to be honest” (Sam, interview 39). The primary conclusion is that individuals with weak <b>empathy,</b> shame, <b>and</b> guilt are more likely to commit acts of violence. These study findings give insight into the real world, situational application of <b>empathy,</b> shame, <b>and</b> guilt, and provide strong support for the role of weak morality in violence decision-making.

25|$|According to Henry Krystal, {{individuals}} {{suffering from}} alexithymia think in an operative way and {{may appear to}} be superadjusted to reality. In psychotherapy, however, a cognitive disturbance becomes apparent as patients tend to recount trivial, chronologically ordered actions, reactions, and events of daily life with monotonous detail. In general, these individuals lack imagination, intuition, <b>empathy,</b> <b>and</b> drive-fulfillment fantasy, especially in relation to objects. Instead, they seem oriented toward things and even treat themselves as robots. These problems seriously limit their responsiveness to psychoanalytic psychotherapy; psychosomatic illness or substance abuse is frequently exacerbated should these individuals enter psychotherapy.|$|E
40|$|The problem {{involved}} {{in this study was}} to determine the effects of two different training modalities upon the empathic skills of 42 undergraduate college students who had selected some helping profession as a career goal. An experimental design was developed wherein the 42 subjects were randomly assigned to two experimental groups and a control group. One experimental group was given 16 hours of didactic instructions in empathy skills, the other experimental group was subjected to 16 hours of training in meditation. The control group participated in music listening activities during the training period. Post-test empathy scores for the two experimental groups were compared to each other and to the control group. It was also posited that different interpersonal skills may exist within a single individual in comparable amounts. This probability led to efforts to determine the relationship between empathic ability and extra-sensory perception, which is the ability to perceive through other than the usually identified senses. To obtain the ESP scores the Zener ESP Test was administered to the three groups of subjects. The next step was to find the coefficients of correlation between the ESP scores <b>and</b> the <b>empathy</b> scores. The data of the study were analyzed in the following manner: 1. Group means were computed for the <b>empathy</b> test scores <b>and</b> ESP scores of the subjects. 2. A re-test reliability coefficient was computed for the empathy test scores of all subjects. 3. A randomized block analysis of variance was computed and the appropriate significance levels were determined. 4. The empathy test mean scores for each group were analyzed by the t-test of significance. 5. A Pearson Product Moment Correlation was computed for the <b>empathy</b> test scores <b>and</b> the ESP scores of each group independently. 6. A Pearson Product Moment Correlation was computed for the <b>empathy</b> test scores <b>and</b> the ESP scores of the total group. Findings Testing of the hypotheses of the study resulted in the following findings: 1. A t-ratio of. 66 with 13 degrees of freedom p 3 ̆e. 519 was not significant at the. 05 level when the mean empathy scores of the <b>empathy</b> group <b>and</b> the control group were compared. 2. A t-ratio of 2. 31 with 13 degrees of freedom and p 3 ̆e. 038 was significant at the. 05 level when the mean empathy scores of the meditation group and the control group were compared. 3. A t-ratio of. 88 with 13 degrees of freedom and p 3 ̆c. 395 was not significant at the. 05 level when the mean empathy scores of the meditation group <b>and</b> the <b>empathy</b> group were compared. 4. An F-ratio of 1. 338 was not significant at the. 05 level, for the empathy scores of the <b>empathy,</b> meditation, <b>and</b> control group. 5. An r of -. 06 with p 3 ̆e. 42 was not significant when the <b>empathy</b> scores <b>and</b> the ESP scores of the empathy group were correlated. 6. An r of -. 425 with p 3 ̆e. 065 was not significant when the <b>empathy</b> scores <b>and</b> the ESP scores of the meditation group were correlated. 7. An r of -. 51 with p 3 ̆c. 03 was significant when the <b>empathy</b> scores <b>and</b> the ESP scores of the control group were correlated. 8. An r of -. 37 with p 3 ̆c. 008 was significant when the <b>empathy</b> scores <b>and</b> the ESP scores of all subjects were correlated. Conclusions Within the limitations of the study the following conclusions may be drawn: 1. The null hypothesis of no significant difference between the empathy scores of the <b>empathy</b> group <b>and</b> the control group is accepted. Subjects trained in empathy did not earn significantly higher scores than subjects who did not receive training, 2. The null, hypothesis of no significant difference between the empathy scores of the meditation group and the control group is rejected. Meditation training indicates a trend toward influencing higher empathy performance for subjects trained in the technique, 3. The null hypothesis of no significant difference between the empathy scores of the <b>empathy</b> group <b>and</b> the control group is accepted. Empathy training did not have a significant effect on empathy scores. 4. The null hypothesis that there is no significant difference between the mean empathy scores of the <b>empathy,</b> meditation, <b>and</b> control group is accepted. There were no significant inter action effects of the total group of subjects. 5. The null hypothesis of no significant correlation between the <b>empathy</b> scores <b>and</b> the ESP scores of the empathy group is accepted. Subjects on the whole did not show similar levels of performance on the <b>empathy</b> test <b>and</b> the ESP test. 6. The null hypothesis of no significant correlation between the <b>empathy</b> scores <b>and</b> the ESP scores of the meditation group is accepted. There is no relationship between the <b>empathy</b> test performance <b>and</b> the ESP test performance of the subjects who received meditation training. 7. The null hypothesis of no significant correlation between the <b>empathy</b> test scores <b>and</b> the ESP test scores of the control group is rejected. There is a positive relationship between the <b>empathy</b> test performance <b>and</b> the ESP test performance of the subjects in the control group. 8.

25|$|In {{addition}} to the contingency-focused approaches mentioned, {{there has been a}} high degree of interest paid to three novel approaches that have recently emerged. The first is transformational leadership, which posits that there are certain leadership traits that inspire subordinates to perform beyond their capabilities.

This type of leader fills more of a managerial role and lacks qualities necessary to inspire subordinates and induce meaningful change. And the third is authentic leadership which is centered around <b>empathy</b> <b>and</b> a leader's values or character. If the leader understands their followers, they can inspire subordinates by cultivating a personal connection and leading them to share in the vision and goals of the team. Although there has been a limited amount of research conducted on these theories, they are sure to receive continued attention as the field of I/O psychology matures.|$|E
