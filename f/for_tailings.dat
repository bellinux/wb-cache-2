50|$|The most {{important}} benefit of closure planning is identification of critical activities to achieve successful reclamation. Closure planning usually identifies areas of needed research.

These plans provide some {{assurance that the}} mine is not “painting itself into a corner” and provide a starting basis to estimate financial assurance levels - important to both mines and regulators. It also forms a base case against which future planning changes can be compared. Much of this work falls under the concept of “design for closure” introduced 30 years ago.|$|E

5000|$|Today, modern {{vehicles}} {{widely known}} as amphirols, perform specialised {{tasks such as}} compacting tailings from industrial processes. The advantage of these machines to tailings densification is by way of providing a means to allow water or process liquor to run off without repulping the profile. This approach subsequently largely negates the impact of rainfall on densification and dewatering. However, the lighter, faster machines are better suited to marginal terrain access, but not densification due to repulping and their limited penetration depth. The process of using these machines specifically <b>for</b> <b>tailings</b> and dredge spoil densification is commonly termed [...] "mud farming" [...] in the mining industry.|$|E
50|$|When {{construction}} work began after Coeur received its final construction permits in 2005, {{including the use}} of the Slate Lake drainage as a location to dispose of tailings created by the milling of ore from the mine in order to handle waste disposal.

Construction of the tailings facility was halted however, as following the issuance of the permit <b>for</b> <b>tailings</b> disposal, a lawsuit was filed by a group of environmental non-governmental organizations.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of an in situ heavy metals fixation technique aimed at converting contaminants to low solubility and low bioavailability forms, eliminating the risk posed by oxidic tailings and contaminated soils, was investigated. Calcium oxyphosphate salt (Ca(H 2 PO 4) (2). H 2 O) {{was used as}} a stabilizing agent <b>for</b> oxidic <b>tailings</b> and contaminated soils originating from Montevecchio, Sardinia, Italy. Stabilization was effected by mixing the contaminated soil or oxidic tailing sample with calcium oxyphosphate salt at various doses.

Complementary EDTA extraction tests and biological tests using beans Phaseolous vulgaris as plant indicator were carried out. The toxicity of Pb and Cd was reduced below TCLP regulatory limits at calcium oxyphosphate doses higher than 0. 7 and 0. 2 % w/w <b>for</b> soils and <b>tailings,</b> respectively. Lead solubility according to the EDTA test decreased with phosphate dose for both materials tested. Lead uptake by plant leaves and roots from the soil sample decreased with the phosphate addition, while Cd uptake remained almost constant.

5000|$|Bounded by {{impoundment}}s (an impoundment is a dam), these dams typically use [...] "local materials" [...] {{including the}} tailings themselves, {{and may be}} considered embankment dams. Traditionally, the only option <b>for</b> <b>tailings</b> storage was {{to deal with a}} tailings slurry. This slurry is a dilute stream of the tailings solids within water that was sent to the tailings storage area. The modern tailings designer has a range of tailings products to choose from depending upon how much water is removed from the slurry prior to discharge. The removal of water not only can create a better storage system in some cases (e.g. dry stacking, see below) but can also assist in water recovery which is a major issue as many mines are in arid regions. In a 1994 description of tailings impoundments, however, the U.S. EPA stated that dewatering methods may be prohibitively expensive except in special circumstances. Subaqueous storage of tailings has also been used.Tailing ponds are areas of refused mining tailings where the waterborne refuse material is pumped into a pond to allow the sedimentation (meaning separation) of solids from the water. The pond is generally impounded with a dam, and known as tailings impoundments or tailings dams. It was estimated in 2000 that there were about 3,500 active tailings impoundments in the world. The ponded water is of some benefit as it minimizes fine tailings from being transported by wind into populated areas where the toxic chemicals could be potentially hazardous to human health; however, it is also harmful to the environment. Tailing ponds are often somewhat dangerous because they attract wildlife such as waterfowl or caribou as they appear to be a natural pond, but they can be highly toxic and harmful to the health of these animals. Tailings ponds are used to store the waste made from separating minerals from rocks, or the slurry produced from tar sands mining. Tailings are sometimes mixed with other materials such as bentonite to form a thicker slurry that slows the release of impacted water to the environment.|$|E

40|$|A good dam {{surveillance}} {{program is}} the foundation of an overall tailings dam safety program. Tailings dams are dynamic and continually evolving structures, under construction on a regular, and often near-continuous, basis, and have a closure phase that lasts “forever”. This is in contrast to conventional, water-retaining dams, which are built in a single stage {{at the onset of the}} project, have a finite operating life and are not required to last “forever”. Tailings dams also can undergo environmental as well as physical failure, unlike conventional water-retaining dams that can only undergo physical failure. Accordingly, requirements <b>for</b> <b>tailings</b> dam surveillance, contrary to common perception, can be and frequently are more stringent, requiring frequent review and modification, than is the case for conventional water-retaining dams of equivalent hazard rating. Case history experience has repeatedly demonstrated that a great many tailings dam failure modes give warning signs that, if properly monitored and interpreted, give advance warning of problems, affording the opportunity to take preventative measures. This experience serves to emphasize the importance of a good surveillance program <b>for</b> <b>tailings</b> dams. Such a program involves much more than simply specification of instrumentation, reading those instruments, and filing of data reports. It requires understanding and management of risk, commitment, adequate resources and support, awareness, interpretive imagination, and clarity of communication among all responsible parties...|$|E

40|$|Laboratory {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the distribution of various arsenic species in tailings and soils. Other specific goal of the tests were to evaluate the extraction efficiency of arsenic using alkaline or acid washing, to determine optimum operational parameters of alkaline washing, and to evaluate the arsenic precipitation of washing effluents by pH adjustment or ferric chloride addition. Alkaline washing using sodium hydroxide {{was found to be}} favorable in removing arsenic from tailings or soils having a higher portion of arsenic in the operationally defined crystalline mineral fraction of crystalline oxide and amorphous aluminosilicates. This is due to the ligand displacement reaction of hydroxyl ions with arsenic species and high pH conditions that can prevent readsorption of arsenic because predominant negatively charged crystalline oxides do not attract the negatively charged oxyanions. <b>For</b> <b>tailings,</b> sodium hydroxide had 10 - 20 times higher extraction efficiencies than hydrochloric- or citric acid. The optimum concentration of sodium hydroxide for soil washing was determined to be 200 mM for all samples, while the optimum ratios were 10 : 1 and 5 : 1 <b>for</b> <b>tailings</b> and field/river sedimentary soils, respectively.
