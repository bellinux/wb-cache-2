Three-dimensional free <b>form</b> <b>shape</b> matching {{is a fundamental}} problem in both the machine vision and pattern recognition literatures. However, the automatic approach to 3 D free <b>form</b> <b>shape</b> matching still remains open. In this paper, we propose using k closest {{points in the second}} view for the automatic 3 D free <b>form</b> <b>shape</b> matching. For the sake of computational efficiency, the optimised k-D tree is employed for the search of the k closest points. Since occlusion and appearance and disappearance of points almost always occur, slack variables have to be employed, explicitly modelling outliers in the process of matching. Then the relative quality of each possible point match is estimated using the graduated assignment algorithm, leading the camera motion parameters to be estimated by the quaternion method in the weighted least-squares sense. The experimental results based on both synthetic data and real images without any pre-processing show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm for the automatic matching of overlapping 3 D free <b>form</b> <b>shapes</b> with either sparse or dense points.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} commentary, which accompanies a folio of electroacoustic/acousmatic, {{instrumental}} {{and mixed}} compositions, is to investigate the relationship of instrumental and acousmatic compositional practices and to find common integrating structural strategies. These practices are also related to the handling and organization of disparate and large amounts of sound information in both media. Multi-dimensional aural spaces are very common in both instrumental and acousmatic media when timbre becomes a dynamic and <b>form</b> <b>shaping</b> parameter. The listener may perceive the musical discourse in multi-dimensional musical spaces through multiple perceptional modes. A musical syntax of those - usually indeterminate and ambiguous - aural spaces may be achieved through a hybridization of interconnected temporal concepts, connected to motion, gesture and shape, and spatial concepts, connected to sound source and timbre. The narrative structure of the musical discourse is linked to conceptualizations of physical and conceptual musical spaces through cognitive schemas and patterns and can be approached through visual and spatial metaphors that resemble film and TV montage structures.

Once manufactured, these layers are stacked to produce a physical model. Tool path generation for the heated flexible blade tool is a challenging task, since it influences {{the quality of the}} manufactured objects as well as the effectiveness of the fabrication process. The difficulties arise from the following facts: (a) when slicing is computed, the instantaneous tool positions are defined by matching the blade profile against the nominal shape of the CAD model, (b) the tool positions calculated relative to the cut layers have to be converted into the global reference frame of the layer cutting equipment, (c) the resultant tool path should maintain the achieved preciseness approximating the front surface of the layers, and (d) it is impossible to calculate all points of the tool path in real time. This paper proposes an effective tool path calculation method for flexible blade cutting. The contour of the layers is converted into an ordered set of smooth and awkward boundary features. For the smooth boundary features, the tool positions are computed by dense sampling in order to achieve the optimal cutting...|$|E

The algorithms are driven by classical instrumental performance through hybrid systems called hyperinstruments, in which the sensing of the performance gestures leads to open and goal-oriented generative music forms. The interactions are composed with MAX/Msp, designing contexts and relationships between real-time instrumental timbre analysis (sometimes with added inertial motion tracking) with a gesture-based idea of <b>form</b> <b>shaping.</b> Physical classical instruments are treated as interfaces, giving rise {{to the need to}} develop unconventional mapping strategies on account of the multi-dimensional and interconnecting quality of timbre. Performance and sound gestures are viewed as salient energies, phrasings and articulations carrying information about human intentions, in this way becoming able to change the musical behaviour of a composition inside a coded dramaturgy. The interactive networks are designed in order to integrate traditional music practices and “languages” with computational systems designed to be self-regulating, through the mediation of timbre space and performance gestural descriptions. Following its classic definition, technology aims to be mainly related not to mechanical practices but rather to rhetorical approaches: for this reason the software often foresees interactive scores, and must be performed in accordance with a set of external verbal (and video) explanations, whose technical detail should nevertheless not impair the most intuitive approach to music making...|$|E

40|$|The SoftAssign {{algorithm}} is an elegant free <b>form</b> <b>shape</b> matching algorithm. While its objective function {{can be interpreted}} as consisting of three desired terms: minimising a weighted sum of matching errors of combinations of all the points in the two free <b>form</b> <b>shapes</b> to be matched, equalising their weights (probabilities) of being real ones and also maximising the overlapping area between the free <b>form</b> <b>shapes</b> to be matched, the last term has no effect on the optimisation of the parameters of interest due to normalisation. In this paper, we reformulate the last two terms using the inequality about the geometric and algebraic averages and the sum of the powers of these probabilities. For the sake of computational efficiency, instead of considering combinations of all the points in the overlapping free <b>form</b> <b>shapes</b> to be matched, we employ the traditional closest point criterion to establish possible correspondences between the two overlapping free <b>form</b> <b>shapes</b> to be matched. The saddle point solution of the resulting objective function no longer yields a closed form solution to the parameters of interest. For easy computation, we then adopt a pseudo-linearisation method to linearise the first order derivative of the objective function, leading the parameters of interest to be tracked and estimated with a closed form solution. The parameters of interest are finally optimised using the efficient deterministic annealing scheme with the camera motion parameters estimated using the quaternion method in the weighted least squares sense.

40|$|Introduction: In {{alluvial}} streams, {{water flow}} affects the sediment and transports {{them to the}} downstream constantly. In the meantime, bed forms will be created on stream bed with various dimensions and in different conditions. In this paper experiments have been done to study the influences of width reduced transitions on the height of ripple forms. These transitions are made with different angel 5, 10 and 15 degrees. Based on Van Rijn (7), when the sediment particles are smaller than 500 μm, if the flow velocity exceeds about 10 to 20 percent of critical velocity for starting the particle movement, small ripples grow on the bed surface. Ripple profiles have an asymmetric shape which has steep slope at the upstream and mild slope at the downstream. If the particles are bigger, flow velocity should be higher too {{in order to create}} taller ripples and in this situation a variety of bed form height and length will occur. There is a lot of research associated to bed form formation in alluvial beds like Van Rijn (4 and 7), Karim (2009), Omid and et al (2010), Chegini and Pender (2012) and Esmaili and et al (2009). But in none of them a width reduced transition has applied. The mail part of this research is specified to the effects of width reduced transitions on the dimension of ripple bed form. Methods and Materials: Experiments were done in the hydraulic laboratory of water engineering faculty of Tabriz University. The flume had a 6 m long, 50 cm height and 50 cm wide flume. The α (angle of transition at the beginning) was different. The sediment particles had D_ 50 = 0. 86 mm and ρ_s= 2300 gr. 〖cm〗^(- 3). The sediment flow was directly injected to the main flow from the upstream carefully. Water level was measured with scales installed on the glass wall of the flume and sediments were collected {{with the help of a}} sand trap located at the end of the flume. Experiments were classified in three discharges of 10, 12 and 14 L. S- 1 and in 0, 0. 006, 0. 009, 0. 012 and 0. 015 slopes of the channel. π Buckingham method was used to obtain a dimensionless relationship such as ∆/y=f(F_r,α). In which the ∆ is the bed form height, y is the flow depth, Fr is the Froud number and the α is the transition angle at the beginning part of it. To compare the situation of having transitions with the absence of any transition, was studied as a witness type. Totally, 136 experiments were done. Results and Discussion:The changes in the bed form height based on different Froud Numbers, are exhibited in a series of curves. Basically, transitions which shortened the flow width, in low discharges, the initial walls of these transitions act like a barrier and absorb a significant amount of flow intensity. Therefore, when there is no such a transition, it is accepted that the flow has more freedom and as a result bed form height will grow bigger. Naturally, if the reduction of the channel width was milder, the barrier effect on the flow would be smaller slight. In study of bed <b>form</b> <b>shaping</b> and its height, in low discharges (e. 10 L. S- 1) the flow intensity is not strong enough to conquer the barrier role of the transitions and however with increasing angle of the transition, the bed forms height in the transition area decreased. For the 12 L. S- 1 discharge the flow intensity is more and the power of entering flow to the transition is higher and ripples with taller height exist. But the point is that the 12 lit. s^(- 1) is still a transition stage, it means that when the discharge reaches to 14 L. S- 1, the bed form height has increased about 10 to 12 percent, comparing with no transitions. Another important issue is that, in any situation, transitions with α= 15 ° have a strong barrier role against the flow and they always reduce the bed form height. Conclusions: It can conclude that width reduced transitions can decrease scours slightly and therefore sediment transitions was reduced about 15 to 20 percent, compared with no transitions installed on the flume. The results show that if the discharge exceeds 14 L. S- 1 or if steeper angles for the initial part of the transitions are used, the transition loses the barrier role and even they increases turbulences at the beginning and much more sediment would pass through the transition area due to higher velocities...|$|E

IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 33 (5), 1058 - 1064 For {{accurate}} {{registration of}} overlapping free <b>form</b> <b>shapes,</b> {{different points in}} one shape must select different points in another as their most sensible correspondents. To reach this ideal state, {{in this paper we}} develop a novel algorithm to penalize those points in one shape that select the same closest point in another as their tentative correspondents. The novel algorithm then models the relative weight change over time of a tentative correspondence as the difference between the negative functions of the numbers of points in one shape that actually and ideally select the same closest point in another. Such modeling results in an optimal estimation of the weights of different tentative correspondences, in the sense of deterministic annealing, that lead the camera motion parameters to be estimated in the weighted least squares sense.
