50|$|In a Liberal Party {{preselection}} battle {{before the}} 2007 state election, O'Dea defeated the sitting member for Davidson, Andrew Humpherson. Humpherson had cross-factional backing among many delegates, but had lost support in local branches after reportedly <b>instructing</b> <b>party</b> members to quit branches supportive of O'Dea, thereby reducing their voting power. Despite Humpherson having {{the support of}} the Party Leader, Peter Debnam, O'Dea won the vote 54 votes to 52 and Humpherson chose to not re-contest the election. In March 2007, O'Dea was elected to Parliament with a majority of 24.7 points. In June 2007, he was appointed a member of the Committee on the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC). From 2008 in Opposition, O'Dea served as the chair of the NSW Coalition WasteWatch Committee. In 2011 he was elected Chair of the crucial cross-party Public Accounts Committee of the NSW Parliament.|$|E

He also stated that Tsvangirai had addressed numerous party rallies telling supporters that the MDC was not participating in the elections, that he wrote to the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission telling them to register all MDC candidates wishing to participate as independent candidates.

40|$|Reason {{for change}} and {{expected}} benefits/business motivation: In spring 2014 several workshops on volumetric assumptions and timeline of End-of-Day/Start-of-Day took place. Within these workshops the possibilities to query information on all securities positions resp. settlement instructions of a CSD were discussed with the aim to facilitate the CSD’s reconciliation of settlement instructions and securities positions. The option to send several queries (e. g. per account owning party or per <b>instructing</b> <b>party)</b> and to receive for each query one query response was not deemed useful. Instead, the CSDs intend to send one query and to receive one query response. Thus, the need to query securities positions and settlement instructions by CSD has arisen. The participants of the workshop identified the need to retrieve all settlement instructions within the CSD by sending a single query. Similarly, {{there is a need}} to retrieve all securities positions of previous business days on securities accounts of the CSD itself and all its CSD participants by sending a single query. Moreover, it was identified in these workshops that {{there is a need to}} include in a Statement of Pending Instructions not only those Settlement Instructions which expect settlement at the current business day. For complete and delta reports, all Settlement Instructions within the data scope covered by the report shall be taken into account regardless of their intended settlement date.

50|$|In the 1870s, the People's Party {{was created}} in Utah Territory and backed by the LDS Church. The anti-Mormon Liberal Party existed {{at the same time}} but won few elections. The Salt Lake Tribune was the {{newspaper}} of the Liberal Party while the Deseret News supported the pro-Mormon People's Party. Church leaders realized that one obstacle to achieving statehood was that its population did not participate in either of the two major national political parties. It was decided that the People's Party should be disbanded. The Republican Party had opposed statehood for Utah. Because of this, the majority of Mormons in Utah leaned Democrat. However, church leaders {{did not want to see}} the entire body of the church turn Democrat leading to a continuation of the status-quo where there was one political party supported by the church and another party opposed to it. George Q. Cannon was sent by the First Presidency of the Church to <b>instruct</b> <b>party</b> leaders to make sure that Church members were split between the Republicans and Democrats.

40|$|This {{essay is}} a {{response}} to Ian Ayres 2 ̆ 7 s, 2 ̆ 2 Regulating Opt-Out: An Economic Theory of Altering Rules, 2 ̆ 2 121 Yale L. J. 2032 (2012). Ayres identifies an important question: How does the law decide when parties have opted-out of a contractual default? Unfortunately, his article tells only half of the story about such altering rules. Ayres cares about rules designed to <b>instruct</b> <b>parties</b> on how to get the terms that they want. By focusing on such rules he ignores altering rules designed instead to interpret the nonlegal meaning of the parties 2 ̆ 7 acts or agreement. This limited vision is characteristic of economic approaches to contract law. Valuable as they are for identifying the incentives, intended or unintended, that legal rules create, they tend to overlook other functions of contract law. The essay develops these points by applying the interpretation-construction distinction to Ayres 2 ̆ 7 s theory. It distinguishes between two categories of altering rules, 2 ̆ 2 juristic 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 hermeneutic. 2 ̆ 2 Juristic altering rules are designed to help parties get the legal outcomes they want, though as Ayres points out, such rules also might attempt to slow parties with extra transaction costs. Hermeneutic altering rules condition legal change on the nonlegal meanings of what the parties say and do. Their application therefore requires a broader form of interpretation. The essay identifies the connections between each type of rule and more general principles and purposes of contract law. And it argues that attention to hermeneutic altering rules can fill in some of the gaps in Ayres 2 ̆ 7 s account, such as explaining why juristic altering rules often specify sufficient but non-necessary means of effecting a legal change...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} and perception of emotional speech is of growing importance to forensic speech scientists. They are often asked by <b>instructing</b> <b>parties</b> {{to provide an}} opinion as to whether recordings representing a violent attack are genuine, and whether speech material reflects real distress. However, they are prohibited from making statements regarding the psychological states of speakers by the International Association of Forensic Phonetics and Acoustics Code of Practice (IAFPA 2004). This study investigates two principal questions. First, it investigates how distress speech can be manifested acoustically. In so doing it proposes a taxonomy for comparing distress speech across speakers, assists in delimiting {{the boundaries of the}} vocal repertoire, and considers the extent to which acoustic measures of distress speech can distinguish between the vocalisations of real victims and actors. Second, it investigates whether listeners can discriminate between genuine and acted distress portrayals, and to what extent familiarity with forensic material increases listeners’ ability. Recordings from authentic criminal cases involving violent attack are compared with re-enactments by trained actors. Acoustic analyses examine F 0, intensity, vowel formant frequencies and articulation rate. The recordings are also used as stimuli in a perceptual listening test, comparing the performance of lay listeners, police call takers and forensic practitioners. The findings lend support to the view that assessments of distress should be exercised with extreme caution. On the one hand, acoustic parameters can distinguish between non-distress and distress conditions, but cannot discriminate between acted and authentic distress, and so IAFPA’s refrain from such an assessment is justified. On the other, listeners who are familiar with authentic distress data, such as police call takers and forensic practitioners, are better able to differentiate between acted and authentic distress than lay listeners. Thus, if an assessment were to be made, the forensic practitioners may be the best group to do so. ...|$|R
