500|$|The first segment, [...] "The Devil and Homer Simpson", {{was written}} by Daniels and McGrath. The first time Devil Flanders appears, he looks {{the same as the}} devil Chernabog from the 1940 Walt Disney {{produced}} film Fantasia; Silverman particularly admired the animation in that sequence. Oakley loved the idea of Flanders being the Devil because he <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>you</b> would least expect. He also thought Harry Shearer {{did a good job of}} playing Flanders in a much darker way, while remaining very true to the character. Many scenes had to be cut to shorten the segment, including one that showed Homer's severed head being used as a bowling ball by a demon in hell. This scene later appeared in the clip show episode [...] "The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular", which aired in the show's seventh season.|$|E
500|$|Already a star at {{the time}} of release, Knightley's {{appearance}} in the film was emphasised by featuring her in all promotional materials (similar to Colin Firth's prominent appearance in the 1995 adaptation). Several commentators likened the main poster of Pride & Prejudice to that of 1995's Sense and Sensibility, which was seen as an attempt to attract the same demographic. Advertising noted that the film came [...] "from the producers of Bridget Jones's Diary", a 2001 romantic comedy film, before mentioning Austen. Leading up to the release, fans were allowed to download pictures and screensavers online, which emphasised the differences between Pride & Prejudice and previous adaptations. Lydia Martin wrote that in contrast to past Pride and Prejudice productions, marketing materials downplayed the [...] "suggested antagonism between the heroes" [...] in favour of highlighting a [...] "romantic relationship", as can be seen with the positioning of the characters {{as well as with the}} tagline, [...] "Sometimes the last person on earth you want to be with <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>you</b> can't be without." ...|$|E
500|$|Authors Tracey West and Katherine Noll called Charizard the [...] "best Fire type Pokémon" [...] and the [...] "third best Pokémon overall".

[...] 1UP editor Kat Bailey {{expressed}} concern about which Pokémon could follow the player in Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver, stating [...] "allowing popular favorites like Charizard would go over quite well". The Daily Cardinal editor Kyle Sparks called Charizard [...] "the most dominant Pokémon in the whole universe, a force of sheer strength". In a poll conducted by IGN, it was voted as the [...] "best Pokémon", where the staff commented about remembering being torn between choosing Blastoise and Charizard {{at the start of}} the game. In a poll by Official Nintendo Magazine, Charizard was voted as the [...] "best Fire-type Pokémon". They stated, [...] "not only is Charizard your favourite fire Pokémon, but it is probably one of the most popular 'mon of all time". Kotaku editor Patricia Hernandez criticized Charizard's Y Mega Evolution for not differing enough from Charizard's original design, while praising Mega Charizard X for changing color, and turning Charizard into a dragon-type. Game Informer ranked Charizard as the [...] "coolest Pokémon out of the original 151", describing it as [...] "Powerful, gigantic, and imposing". They further commented that [...] "Pikachu may be the one you recognize, but Charizard <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>you</b> want." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the 1980s, Italo Calvino said in {{his essay}} [...] "Why Read the Classics?"

[...] Consideration of what makes a literary work a classic is for Calvino ultimately a personal choice, and, constructing a universal definition {{of what constitutes a}} Classic Book seems to him to be an impossibility, since, as Calvino says [...] "There is nothing for it but {{for all of us to}} invent our own ideal libraries of classics." ...|$|E

6000|$|Now, Lucilla, {{these are}} the {{practical}} conclusions which any person of sense would arrive at, supposing the texts which relate to the inner evil of the heart were as many, and as prominent, as they are often supposed to be by careless readers. But {{the way in which}} common people read their Bibles is just like the way that the old monks thought hedgehogs ate grapes. They rolled themselves (it was said), over and over, where the grapes lay on the ground. What fruit stuck to their spines, they carried off, and ate. So your hedgehoggy readers roll themselves over and over their Bibles, and declare that whatever sticks to their own spines is Scripture; and that nothing else is. But you can only get the skins of the texts that way. If you want their juice, you must press them in cluster. Now, the clustered texts about the human heart, insist, as a body, not on any inherent corruption in all hearts, but on the terrific distinction between the bad and the good ones. 'A good man, out of the good treasure of his heart, bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man, out of the evil treasure, bringeth forth that which is evil.' 'They on the rock are they which, in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it.' 'Delight thyself in the Lord, and He shall give thee the desires of thine heart.' 'The wicked have bent their bow, that they may privily shoot at him that is upright in heart.' And so on; they are countless, to the same effect. And, for all of us, the question is not at all to ascertain how much or how little corruption there is in human nature; but to ascertain whether, out of all the mass of that nature, we are of the sheep or the goat breed; whether we are people of upright heart, being shot at, or people of crooked heart, shooting. And, of all the texts bearing on the subject, this, which is a quite simple and practical order, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>you</b> have chiefly to hold in mind. 'Keep thy heart with all diligence, for out of it are the issues of life.' ...|$|E
