5|$|Japanese losses <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> {{amounted}} to a significantly higher total {{than those of the}} Allies, although exact numbers have not been established. About 12,500Japanese soldiers participated in the campaign and about 5,500are believed to have been killed. Some sources indicate a possibly higher toll. With only 4,300 Japanese reaching Sio {{at the end of the}} campaign, it is possible that the figure is closer to 7,000 or 8,000. A significant amount of war materiel was also lost <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign.</b> Of the 26 field artillery pieces that the Japanese possessed in the region, 18 were captured by the Australians <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign,</b> while 28 out of their 36 heavy machine-guns were also lost.|$|E

5|$|Other {{candidates}} in the Democratic field included sitting lieutenant governor Thelma Stovall, Terry McBrayer (the choice of sitting governor Julian Carroll), congressman Carroll Hubbard, state auditor George Adkins, and Louisville mayor Harvey Sloane. Initially the leading candidate, Stovall was hampered <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> by ill health. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign,</b> Brown was attacked by McBrayer for refusing to release his federal tax returns. McBrayer also claimed that Brown had not voted in a Democratic primary since 1975, a charge validated by public voting records. Nevertheless, Brown won the primary {{by a margin of}} 25,000 votes. The race was so close that Sloane, Brown's closest competitor, refused to concede for two days. Brown defeated former Republican governor Louie B. Nunn in the 1979 general election by a vote of 554,083 to 376,809.|$|E
5|$|Philip {{probably}} also campaigned in Thrace in late 352 BC, possibly {{after returning to}} Macedon from Thessaly. At this point, if not before, Philip defeated Amadokos and subjugated him, and possibly also expelled Cetriporis from his client kingship. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign,</b> Philip's army reached deep into Kersebleptes' territory and laid siege to the fortress of Heraion Teichos located somewhere near Perinthos, {{on the coast of}} the Propontis (although Buckler places this siege in 353 BC). On learning of the siege, the Athenians voted to dispatch 40 triremes to oppose Philip. However, they then heard that Philip had died (or had been taken ill), so the relief mission never actually sailed. It seems clear that Philip did fall ill <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>campaign,</b> but exactly how the campaign ended is unclear. It was probably at this time that Philip took Kersebleptes' son as a hostage to Pella, effectively ending Kersebleptes' freedom of action.|$|E
