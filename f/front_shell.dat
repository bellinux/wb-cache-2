5000|$|Conway Morris and Caron (2007) {{published}} the first description of Orthrozanclus reburrus. This resembled the halkieriids in having concentric bands of sclerites, although only two and not mineralized; and one shell {{at what was}} presumed to be the front and which was similar in shape to Halkieria’s <b>front</b> <b>shell.</b> It also had long spines rather like those of Wiwaxia. Conway Morris and Caron regarded this creature {{as evidence that the}} [...] "halwaxiids" [...] were a valid taxon and were monophyletic, in other words shared a common ancestor {{with each other and with}} no other organism. They published two cladograms, representing alternative hypotheses about the evolution of the lophotrochozoa, the lineage that includes molluscs, annelids and brachiopods: ...|$|E
5000|$|The sole {{was soft}} and {{probably}} muscular. Since Halkieria was unsuited to swimming and had no obvious adaptations for burrowing, it must have lived on the sea-floor, [...] "walking" [...] by making its muscular sole ripple. The backward-projecting siculate sclerites may have improved its grip by preventing it from slipping backwards. Some specimens have been found partially rolled up, rather like a pillbug, and in this position the cultrate sclerites projected outwards, which probably deterred predators. It {{is difficult to determine}} the functions of the cap-shaped shells {{at either end of the}} animal, as the sclerites appear to have offered adequate protection. Scars on the inner surface of the <b>front</b> <b>shell</b> may indicate that it provided an attachment for internal organs. In one specimen the rear shell appears to have rotated by about 45° before fossilization, which suggests there was a cavity underneath, which may have housed gills.|$|E
50|$|The Panther's {{suspension}} was overengineered and the Schachtellaufwerk interleaved {{road wheel}} system made replacing inner road wheels time consuming (though it could operate with missing or broken wheels). The interleaved wheels {{also had a}} tendency to become clogged with mud, rocks and ice, and could freeze solid overnight in the harsh winter weather that followed the autumn rasputitsa mud season on the Eastern <b>Front.</b> <b>Shell</b> damage could cause the road wheels to jam together and become difficult to separate. Interleaved wheels had long been standard on all German half-tracks. The extra wheels did provide better flotation and stability, and also provided more armour protection for the thin hull sides than smaller wheels or non-interleaved wheel systems, but the complexity meant that no other country ever adopted this design for their tanks. In September 1944, and again in March/April 1945, M.A.N. built a limited number of Panthers with overlapping, non-interleaved steel-rimmed 80 cm diameter roadwheels originally designed for Henschel's Tiger II and late series Tiger I Ausf. E tanks. These steel-rimmed roadwheels were introduced from chassis number 121052 due to raw material shortages.|$|E

40|$|A solar {{eruption}} after a flare on 2011 June 7 produced EUV-bright {{impacts of}} fallbacks {{far from the}} eruption site, observed with the Solar Dynamics Observatory. These impacts can {{be taken as a}} template for the impact of stellar accretion flows. Broad redshifted UV lines have been commonly observed in young accreting stars. Here we study the emission from the impacts in the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly’s UV channels and compare the inferred velocity distribution to stellar observations. We model the impacts with two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. We find that the localized UV 1600 Å emission and its timing with respect to the EUV emission {{can be explained by the}} impact of a cloud of fragments. The first impacts produce strong initial upflows. The following fragments are hit and shocked by these upflows. The UV emission comes mostly from the shocked <b>front</b> <b>shell</b> of the fragments while they are still falling, and is therefore redshifted when observed from above. The EUV emission instead continues from the hot surface layer that is fed by the impacts. Fragmented accretion can therefore explain broad redshifted UV lines (e. g., C iv 1550 Å) to speeds around 400 km s− 1 observed in accreting young stellar objects...|$|E

50|$|Harassing fire {{entered a}} new phase {{following}} the widespread mass-production of cheap, long-range high-explosive artillery in World War I, assisted by the static, inflexible nature of the defensive positions faced. Whole batteries {{on all sides of}} the conflict were dedicated to harassing fire (especially prior to a planned infantry attack) and the concept was refined to a science, complete with formulae for shells-per-hour and pattern density to ensure sleep and resupply were statistically impossible for the targeted force. In most cases, resupply and relief was already nearly impossible during the day due to artillery observers, and the addition of random harassing fire at night meant even fewer replacements and supplies could reach the <b>front.</b> The <b>shell</b> shock this eventually induced in the enemy was usually a disassociative psychological reaction to months of unending explosions, fear, hunger and sleep deprivation.|$|R
