50|$|A law of 29 April 1949 {{introduced}} new {{provisions for}} unemployment insurance and labour policy. A Central Commission for Work Training and Assistance for the Unemployed {{was set up}} {{with the task of}} monitoring the state of the labour market and the conditions of the unemployed, while regulations concerning the replacement of the unemployed into the labour market (collocamento) were introduced. Provincial offices for Labour and Full Employment were also established, with local sections, which organised waiting lists, training courses, and the allocation of available jobs, amongst other services. Unemployment indemnity was increased to Lit. 200 per day (approximately 17% of the average gross industrial wage for 1949) and its duration was extended from 120 t 180 days. Unemployment insurance was extended to agricultural workers, and a special unemployment benefit (sussidio straordinario di disoccupazione) was introduced, paid under exceptional circumstances; <b>flat-rate</b> <b>benefit</b> with ad hoc determined level for 90 to 180 days. Vocational training and professional qualification programmes for the unemployed were also introduced, along with a Fund for Professional Training of Workers.|$|E
5000|$|Compared {{to other}} liberal democracies, Ireland's pension {{policies}} have average coverage, which includes 78 {{percent of the}} workforce, and it offers different types of pensions for employees to choose from. The Irish pension system is designed as a pay-as-you-go program {{and is based on}} both public and private pension programs. The OECD's Reviews of Pension Systems: Ireland, explains the structures of both the public and private pension systems. [...] "The public pension system has two sets of flat-rate benefits: 1) a basic <b>flat-rate</b> <b>benefit</b> to all retirees that meet the contribution conditions, the State pension (contributory) or SPC and the State pension (transition) or SPT; and 2) a means-tested benefit tot those that have not contributed or have not contributed enough, the State pension (non-contributory) or SPNC. The SPC is payable from age 66, with the maximum personal rate of EUR 230.30 a week for a single person (paid for 52 weeks per year), corresponding to 33.1 percent of average earnings. The SPNC is currently payable from age 66, with a maximum rate of EUR 219 per week for a single person, i.e. 31.5 percent of average earnings. All recipients of pension benefits are entitled to the Household Benefits Package comprising an electricity/gas and telephone allowance as well as a free television license, if they are over the age of 70, while those between the age of 65-69 are means-tested. The contribution conditions for the SPC are that recipients have started paying social insurance before reaching age 56 and they also have paid at least 520 full-rate insurance contributions if reaching 66 after April 6, 2012. The contribution base rate is currently 14.75 percent, with 10.75 percent paid by employers and 4 percent by employees (except for employees who earn less than EUR 352 per week for whom only employer contributions are payable). The SPNC is financed through general taxation and is paid according to need. As for private pension programs, there three main types; 1) occupational pension schemes that are set up by employers; 2) Personal Retirement Savings Account (PRSAs) that are personal pension saving plans and contributions are made by individuals; and 3) Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) that are also a personal pension saving plan but are excluded from those who are already enrolled in a company pension plan". [...] When looking at the coverage of public and private pension programs, SPC and SPNC cover 46 percent of the workforce, and SPT and occupational or private pension covers 37 percent of the workforce, which is a result from striking differences in industries and occupations. Raab and Gannon point out how [...] "occupational pensions are generally not mandatory, except in the public sector, and that 55 percent of professionals are able to expect a firm's pension but the corresponding share for sales people is 23 percent". [...] The Irish pension policies are designed to offer incentives for labor participation but are still reforming to the changes in the economy.|$|E

30|$|The UK {{activation}} regime {{began with}} the first Restart interviews in 1986. Benefit conditionality was tightened through the early 1990 s. The unemployment benefit {{was replaced by the}} Jobseekers’ Allowance (JSA) in 1996, a <b>flat-rate</b> <b>benefit</b> paid for six months. The Blair government introduced from 1998 onwards a series of so-called “New Deals” targeted at specific groups with the aim of helping them get back to work: the groups included youth, long-term JSA claimants aged 25 – 49, lone parents, older workers and the disabled. The PES was amalgamated with the benefits agency to form Jobcentre Plus (JCP); the new agency became fully operational in 2002.|$|E
30|$|Since then, many {{countries}} have scaled back their redistributive ambitions. In the United Kingdom, National Insurance in the 1960 s provided earnings-related unemployment benefits {{for six months}} and <b>flat-rate</b> <b>benefit</b> for a further six months. The earnings-related benefit scheme was abolished in the 1980 s. Child benefit when introduced in the 1970 s was some 18 per cent of mean gross income for a family with 2 children; today it is only 10 per cent. The UK is not alone. Other OECD countries have seen major cuts in their tax-transfer programmes, such as the Hartz IV measures in Germany. This general trend has been documented by the OECD in their reports Growing Unequal? (OECD, 2008) and Divided We Stand OECD, 2011). As summarised by the Secretary-General of OECD, “from the mid- 1990 s … the reduced redistributive capacity of tax-benefit systems was sometimes the main source of widening household-income gaps” (OECD, 2011).|$|E
40|$|Social {{protection}} {{in case of}} unemployment {{has always been a}} particularly contentious issue. This paper focuses on institutional changes in the unemployment compensation system in Germany since the 1980 s. It starts with a description of key features and the structure of the unemployment insurance system. The paper goes on to show how insurance coverage, benefit generosity (in terms of amount and duration of benefits), and eligibility requirements for drawing on unemployment benefits have evolved over time. Nearly all aspects of unemployment benefits have been reduced since the 1980 s. An exception to this rule {{can be seen in the}} duration of benefits; they were first extended and then subsequently reduced. Elsewhere, the pattern has been of cutbacks. For example, the scope of insurance (measured as the proportion of the labour force being insured) was reduced. This decline, however, was due more to changes in the labour force than to direct government intervention. Replacement rates for unemployment benefits and assistance were cut. In the case of the latter these were transformed into a <b>flat-rate</b> <b>benefit.</b> Finally, regulations regarding eligibility and criteria for qualification and disqualification became increasingly strict.

40|$|This report {{presents}} a policy {{history of the}} Canada Pension Plan (CPP) disability benefit. The Canada Pension Plan is a national public insurance program that provides income protection to workers {{in the event of}} a long-term interruption of earnings resulting from retirement, disability or death. The disability benefit delivers benefits to contributors who cannot work because of a severe and prolonged disability. The CPP also pays a <b>flat-rate</b> <b>benefit</b> to the eligible children of disability beneficiaries. The CPP disability benefit confers a number of important advantages not available through private insurance or most other income security programs. It provides disability coverage for all working Canadians including the self-employed (who are not eligible for workers ’ compensation or Employment Insurance). The CPP does not exclude workers on the basis of former medical history or require higher premiums for contributors deemed to be high risk. It takes some account of disability-related costs by incorporating a flat-rate component into the benefit calculation. It guarantees coverage until recovery from the disability or until retirement or death. Unlike most private insurances, the CPP ensures full inflation protection. The CPP has seen steadily increasing caseloads since disability benefits were first paid i...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, I analyze how {{differences}} in redistributive tax schedules alone and together with wage differences arising from industry-specific shocks form migration incentives. I {{do so with}} the help of a theoretical model in which there are two countries that are identical except that in only one of them income is redistributed. The citizens of these two countries maximize their expected lifetime utility by investing in education and deciding on migration. Allowing for migration increases the investment in human capital by the citizens who initially live in the redistributive country and want to emigrate, while those who wish to emigrate from the country without redistribution may lower their educational effort. Moreover, migration influences the composition of the population of the redistributive country which, in turn, changes the size of the tax revenue and may reduce or increase the <b>flat-rate</b> <b>benefit.</b> Comparing the individuals' utility before and after migration is allowed reveals that integrating labor markets may result in a Pareto improvement.

40|$|Bernard Fusulier {{examines}} where Belgium {{is situated}} on the continuum of societal models for work-family articulation. On indicators of women’s employment, Belgium lies nearer to the Nordic countries (at one extreme of the continuum) than Japan (at the other); the employment gap {{between men and women}} is closing, though the employment rate for men is still around 15 per centage points higher than for women and, overall, time use remains very different between men and women. Having set this scene, Fusulier goes on to examine three main support measures: Maternity, Paternity and adoption leave); reduction or suspension of work in the private sector (time credit); and so-called thematic leave (Parental leave, leave to provide care for a seriously ill relative, and palliative care leave). Particular attention is paid to the ‘time credit’ system, first introduced as a ‘career break’ scheme in 1985, which enables workers in the private sector to take at least one year off work (longer where collective agreements permit this) or to work reduced hours for any reason (a similar system – still known as ‘career breaks’ – operates in the public sector). Workers using time credit receive partial income replacement through a <b>flat-rate</b> <b>benefit</b> for one year (extended to five years if the worker takes a full-time time credit to care for children aged under eght years), reduced proportionately if they reduce their working hours. Originally introduced as a means to reduce unemployment at a time of economic crisis, that link no longer exists; paid leave is not now conditional on employers hiring an unemployed person as replacement. The time credit and career break schemes exist alongside Parental leave, and the two are not to be confused...|$|E
40|$|One of the stylized {{facts of}} unfunded social {{security}} programs is that programs are larger in size, measured {{relative to the}} GDP, the tighter the link between pension claims and past earnings. We provide a political economy explanation of this stylized fact in a median voter model, where people vote on the social security tax rate. We compare pension systems with <b>flat-rate</b> and earnings-related <b>benefit</b> formulas. Only <b>flat-rate</b> <b>benefits</b> redistribute within a generation from high to low income groups. If labor supply is endogenous, they also imply larger efficiency costs than earnings-related schemes. Using data on eight European countries, {{we find that the}} median voter is typically middle-aged with high income. For these voters, earnings-related systems are more attractive both because of less intragenerational redistribution and lower distortions in labor supply. The median voter model is also able to account for a considerable degree of cross-country variation in contribution rates. Copyright 2008, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R

In 1942 the KNH, Employees Pension Insurance, was formed for private sector employees and in 1954 was rebuilt, replacing the previously established earnings-based pension model with a two-tier model including a basic flat-rate feature. Disparity existed between private and public sector pension plans as public sector pension benefit levels were generally better and more widely covered, and to address the lack of coverage for certain private sector employees the KN, National Pension law, was passed in 1961 which set up a compulsory savings system requiring everyone from self-employers to the jobless to pay a flat-contribution rate {{on an individual basis}} for a <b>flat-rate</b> <b>benefits</b> package. In 1986, women obtained a way into the pension system through their husbands via contributions deducted from his pay, which entitled the wife to a flat-rate basic pension plan.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{demographic}} {{change and the}} fact that the benefits of a growing proportion of pensioners must be financed by fewer and fewer contributors, poses major problems for the German pay-as-you-go pension scheme. For this reason, the 2001 pension reform entailed a reduction in the level of statutory pensions and strengthened the funded second and third pillars of old-age pension provision. The 'Riester pension', introduced in 2001, aimed at encouraging the accumulation of additional private pensions, and therefore created a voluntary but highly subsidized private pension supplement. The savings incentives - <b>flat-rate</b> <b>benefits</b> and tax breaks – created by the reform were intended to motivate people in the public retirement insurance scheme to compensate for reductions in relative statutory pension levels by paying into private pension funds. 1 State subsidizes for Riester pensions are substantial: Contributions made by people on low earnings and parents attract subsidizes of over 50 per cent - in other words, the state delivers more than half of the savings put aside by these groups of people. How did these subsidies affect the savings behaviour of German private households? This paper uses the Riester pension as an ‘experiment’ that sheds light on how savings incentives work...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{economic}} incentives and welfare-state arrangements in OECD countries; {{it also offers}} some lessons for would-be welfare states. These arrangements differ, of course, among OECD countries. In particular, there is wide variation in {{the extent to which}} countries rely on four basic institutions - the state, the firm, the family and the market. Countries also differ in their reliance on (i) a common safety net, often in the form of <b>flat-rate</b> <b>benefits</b> tied to specific contingencies; (ii) means-tested benefits for low-income groups; and (iii) income protection, i. e., benefits that are tied to previous income. Another distinction between corporatist welfare states, where benefits are tied to labor contracts, and universal welfare states in which benefits are conditional on residence or citizenship. This distinction is blurred, however, by recent tendencies in corporatist welfare states to extend coverage to individuals who have very weak attachment to the labor market, and in universal welfare states to tie benefits to previous or contemporary work under the slogan "workfare" rather than "welfare". The degree of generosity of benefits is another important distinction. Of course, the lower the benefit levels, the stronger the incentives for citizens to opt for voluntary (market) solutions, in the form of private saving and private insurance arrangements. When considering incentive problems in connection with various types of welfare-state arrangements, this paper emphasizes what may be called "dynamic" issues, i. e., incentive effects that evolve over time. These also include endogenous changes in social norms among individuals and endogenous adjustments in political behavior. This approach also makes it necessary to broaden the analysis to fields outside conventionally defined "economic analysis"...|$|R
40|$|Robin Hood, Matteus or strict equality. A {{comparative}} study of welfare state institutions and strategies to decrease inequality and poverty in the rich industrialized countries. How can we best reduce poverty and inequality? The debate on this question has raised other controversial issues: Should social policies be targeted to low-income groups or universal? Should benefits be equal for all or earnings-related? To answer these questions {{it is necessary to}} make three policy-relevant considerations: Firstly, the size of redistributive budgets is not fixed but reflects the structure of welfare state institutions. Secondly, there tends to be a tradeoff between the degree of low income targeting and the size of redistributive budgets. Thirdly, outcomes of market-based distribution are often even more unequal than those of earnings-related social insurance programs. However, traditional arguments in favor of targeting and <b>flat-rate</b> <b>benefits,</b> focusing on the distribution of the money actually transferred, have neglected these considerations. We argue that the design of social insurance institutions is of central importance for redistributive outcomes precisely because it affects the size of redistributive budgets, the tradeoff between targeting and budget size, and the public/private mix of benefit provisions. Our comparative analyses of the effects of different institutional types of welfare states on poverty and inequality are based on new data. The results indicate that institutional differences lead to unexpected outcomes and generate the paradox of redistribution: The more we target benefits at the poor and the more concerned we are with creating equality via equal public transfers to all, the less likely we are to reduce poverty and inequality.
