5000|$|BC Premier W.A.C. Bennett was a {{major player}} in {{negotiating}} the treaty and, according to U.S. Senator Clarence Dill, was a tough bargainer. The U.S. paid C$275 million, which accrued to C$458 million after interest. But Bennett's successor Dave Barrett was skeptical about the deal; he observed that the three dams and associated power lines ultimately cost three times that figure, in addition to other costs.Dr. Hugh L. Keenleyside (for whom Keenleyside dam is named) dismissed these claims and other confusion about the Treaty benefits and costs in his 1974 paper [...] "Ten Year Later, The Results of the Columbia River Treaty." [...] He explained that the original estimate {{of the cost of the}} Canadian dams was about C$411 million in 1963 dollars. Actual cost in 1973 dollars was about C$548 million, and this included $50 million in regional improvement beyond replacement of like for like. This was a 33% increase over ten years, and he noted that during that time the average cost of dams and reservoirs in Canada increased by 80%. The value of the U.S. power and flood control payments in 1973 dollars, which had increased with interest, was C$479 million; leaving a deficit of C$69 million. For this cost, B.C. was then able to add a power house at Mica, and later at Kootenay Canal, Revelstoke and Keenleyside, and construct transmission lines, to <b>delivery</b> <b>power</b> to major load centers far cheaper than alternatives. Since the end of the 30-year sale of the Canadian Entitlement to the U.S. in March 2003, the U.S. delivery of the Entitlement power to B.C. has been a benefit far greater than the C$5 million per year estimate by the Canadian government in 1964. The B.C. government reported in Dec. 2012 that the average annual revenue from the Canadian Entitlement power, which is marketed by POWEREX for the Province, over the previous ten years was C$202 million per year. Those revenues go into the Province’s Consolidated Revenue Fund.|$|E
5000|$|Outwardly, the New Orleans ships had a {{distinctive}} appearance and were considered very good-looking vessels, though the 1942-43 refits {{of the surviving}} ships changed the appearance substantially. The forward superstructure had the bridge wings cut back, {{and all of the}} large size windows were plated in with just a few port holes taking their place. The open bridge above the wheel house was enlarged by 100 percent by extending it forward. In addition several gun tubs were created for the 40 mm Bofors mounts both around the main mast, and aft. The forecastle deck extended back to the second funnel and the main superstructure was constructed without the ungainly tripod mast seen on the previous cruisers. The bow was a raked type, similar to those of British cruisers. The two funnels were situated closer together with a large search light tower in between. Aircraft handling facilities were moved further aft and a larger second conning station erected above the hangar. A single mainmast was erected there, between two huge pedestal cranes which handled both spotter planes and small craft. The main 8-inch turrets, although armored, were actually smaller with a more effective angular faceplate. By enlarging the forecastle deck, the secondary battery of 5-inch guns were mounted closer together, facilitating a more efficient ammunition <b>delivery.</b> <b>Power</b> was provided by eight Babcock & Wilcox high-pressure steam boilers that produced [...] for the four Westinghouse gearing steam turbines. The turbines were shafted to four screws, giving this class a rated speed of 33 kn. The cruisers' range - using 3269 LT of bunker oil - was approximately 14000 nmi km at 10 kn or 5280 nmi km at 20 kn. Their range could be extended by refueling from a tanker or another ship fitted to transfer oil while underway. The New Orleans cruisers performed peacetime exercises well with no serious shortcomings being found. While many changes were implemented to improve their performance and especially their protection, the 10,000-ton limit of the Washington Naval Treaty was not exceeded. The new cruisers were considered successful in their own right but could not be considered equal to some foreign contemporaries, which were often considerably larger.|$|E

40|$|Calcium as a plant nutrient, {{has been}} shown to be {{deficient}} in the soils of eastern Nebraska. Application of lime by farmers is becoming a relatively common practice in this area. Many soil tests have been devised based on the chemical properties of the soil. However, due to the empirical nature of these methods, field experiments of this type involve long periods of time as well as much labor and expense. A cheaper and less time consuming method is desirable. Such a method, the concept of ‘A’ values, exists. This concept utilizes the composition of plants grown on a soil which has been tagged with a radioactive nutrient source as an indication of the nutrient supply of the soil. This method may be extended to suggest a method of calibration of chemical soil tests for lime requirement. Making use of this concept, a greenhouse experiment was devised whereby the calcium contents of some of the more common Nebraska soils could be studied.

40|$|Abstract—In recent years, {{there has}} been an {{increasing}} interest to deliver multimedia services over wireless ad hoc networks. Due to the existence of hidden terminal and absence of central control, the medium access control protocol as used in the ad hoc networks may lead to channel capture, where some flows monopolize the channel while others suffer from starvation. As a consequence, the system throughput and fairness are greatly degraded. After showing that static power control leads to channel capture, we propose and study a distributed dynamic power control scheme termed “power adaptation for starvation avoidance ” (PASA), which dynamically adjusts the transmission power of a node so as to avoid starvation. PASA is shown to be effective in breaking channel captures, hence improving short-term fairness among contending flows. It is simple, fully autonomous and requires no communication overhead. Via extensive simulations, we show that our power control algorithm achieves much better fairness without compromising system throughput through better spatial reuse. Our experiments with video sequences transmitting over different network topologies show that PASA achieves much better video quality with lower start-up delay and buffer requirement.

The first technique is targeted to SoC designs with static voltage assignment, {{while the second}} technique is pertinent to SoC designs with dynamic voltage scaling capability. Conventionally a single level configuration of DC-DC converters, where exactly one converter resides between the power source and each load, is used to deliver currents at appropriate voltage levels to different loads on the chip. In the presence of dynamic voltage scaling capability, each DC-DC converter in this network {{should be able to}} adjust its output voltage. In {{the first part of this}} paper it is shown that in a SoC design with static voltage assignment, a multi-level tree topology of suitably chosen DC-DC converters and voltage regulators between the power source and loads can result in higher power efficiency in the <b>power</b> <b>delivery</b> network. The problem is formulated as a combinatorial problem and is efficiently solved by dynamic programming.
