5|$|Burton {{fails to}} {{complete}} the revised Patient Zero <b>exhibit</b> before its scheduled opening date. The museum curator substitutes the original presentation instead over Burton's protests, leading to a renewed rush of press scapegoating Zero.

Zero merges with his disfigured video image and, smoking a cigarette inside the video, sets off the fire alarm. The sprinklers destroy the video player and Zero vanishes.|$|E
5|$|Critics of {{the planned}} <b>exhibit,</b> {{especially}} those of the American Legion and the Air Force Association, charged that the <b>exhibit</b> focused too much attention on the Japanese casualties inflicted by the nuclear bomb, {{rather than on the}} motivations for the bombing or the discussion of the bomb's role in ending the conflict with Japan. The <b>exhibit</b> brought to national attention many long-standing academic and political issues related to retrospective views of the bombings. As a result, after various failed attempts to revise the <b>exhibit</b> {{in order to meet the}} satisfaction of competing interest groups, the <b>exhibit</b> was canceled on 30 January 1995. Martin O. Harwit, Director of the National Air and Space Museum, was compelled to resign over the controversy.|$|E

5|$|Findings {{from the}} studies of {{children}} from Eastern European orphanages indicate that persistence of the inhibited pattern of RAD is rare in children adopted out of institutions into normative care-giving environments. However, there is a close association between duration of deprivation and severity of attachment disorder behaviors. The quality of attachments that these children form with subsequent care-givers may be compromised, but they probably no longer meet criteria for inhibited RAD. The same group of studies suggests that a minority of adopted, institutionalized children <b>exhibit</b> persistent indiscriminate sociability even after more normative caregiving environments are provided. Indiscriminate sociability may persist for years, even among children who subsequently <b>exhibit</b> preferred attachment to their new caregivers. Some <b>exhibit</b> hyperactivity and attention problems as well as difficulties in peer relationships. In the only longitudinal study that has followed children with indiscriminate behavior into adolescence, these children {{were significantly more likely}} to <b>exhibit</b> poor peer relationships.|$|E

5|$|Maeser's primary {{responsibility}} was {{to head the}} Utah <b>exhibit</b> at the Mid-winter Fair in San Francisco in 1894, while he was serving as Superintendent of Church Schools. The exposition was patterned after Chicago World's Fair of 1893. At the Chicago <b>exhibit,</b> the church had displayed minerals and produce from Utah. In the San Francisco <b>exhibit,</b> Maeser chose {{to focus more on}} beliefs of the church and educational accomplishments of students in the church school systems. The church had an <b>exhibit</b> in the Manufacturers and Liberal Arts Building, and Maeser gave a series of lectures to bring more publicity to the church school <b>exhibit.</b> Utah's participation in the <b>exhibit</b> attempted to gain favor for its becoming a state. He and his companions helped distribute information about the history of Utah. No one was baptized into the church while Maeser was president of the mission; however, he did help create friendlier public-relations between Utah and California.|$|E
