500|$|On 4 October, TV3 {{broadcast}} Vincent Browne's Big Presidential Debate. Gay Mitchell challenged Martin McGuinness on the [...] "fairytale" [...] that he {{left the}} IRA in 1974, asking him directly: [...] "If you (McGuinness) say you left the IRA in 1974 and persist in saying that when you didn’t; <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> are living on the average industrial wage when you are drawing {{down a couple of}} hundred grand– how can people have confidence in your word?" [...] Moderator Vincent Browne later challenged Martin McGuinness' claims {{that he left}} the Provisional Irish Republican Army in 1974, producing eight books with alleged evidence claiming otherwise. McGuinness referenced this moment when he said in a later debate on the radio that people would blame him for the 1916 Rising if they {{could find a way to}} implicate him.|$|E

6000|$|... 'You {{will need}} a reference. At least, I suppose you will. And, anyhow, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> know Lord Mountry it will make it simpler for you with Mr Abney, the brother being at the school.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Louise, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> that, <b>you</b> {{will simply}} drive me to despair, for I shall {{know how you}} will feel when he doesn't--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I only wonder then, M. Chapeau, why {{you want}} the English to come and help <b>you,</b> <b>if,</b> as <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> <b>you</b> have conquered all the {{republicans}} yourselves?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Upon my word, sir, I am {{very sorry}} to vex you; {{but what would}} you have me do? I will give up Parliament altogether, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> that <b>you</b> wish it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never bore them--and {{they are}} so easily bored! It bores them <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> want to be married. I {{think it would be}} sweet to be married, but you should never ask for a wedding. They give you {{everything}} else, but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> want a wedding, they stamp their feet and go away. Why are you crying, girl? You should not cry; they don't like it. Put on your prettiest gown and laugh and pretend you are happy, and then they will tell you naughty stories and give you these." [...] She felt her ears and looked at her fingers, on which there may once have been jewels, but there were none now.|$|E
6000|$|... "That devilish Professor {{you were}} always writing about. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> love him, I know I shall do {{something}} desperate;" [...] and {{he looked as if}} he would keep his word, as he clenched his hands with a wrathful spark in his eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never {{mind what}} we mean," [...] {{declared}} the would-be poet of Brill, stoutly. [...] "I {{want to get}} at the facts in this matter. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> didn't meet Crowden, all right, we'll let it go at that. But there are others who say you did meet him." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{worst thing}} you can do is stop someone from doing {{something}} by saying, [...] "No. Period." [...] <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> no, <b>you</b> have to help them find a better way to get it done.|$|R
6000|$|Val. <b>If,</b> as <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> <b>you</b> silently {{have been}} [...] So long my lover, let my power be seen: [...] One hour's {{discourse}} before Porphyrius die, [...] Is all I ask, and you too may be by.|$|R
60|$|Fost. Saith he, We {{must not}} enter into {{explication}} or dispute now; but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>say</b> <b>you</b> {{will call the}} people no more together, you may have your liberty; <b>if</b> not, <b>you</b> must be sent away to prison.|$|R
6000|$|... "You see, {{people in}} the world, being men themselves, will almost {{certainly}} regard you as a man. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> are not, they will simply say you do not tell the truth. Only exceptional people appreciate the exceptional. When in Rome one must--well, respect Roman prejudices a little--talk Latin. You will find it better----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why didn't {{you talk}} {{yesterday}} morning?" [...] inquired Thurston, and Bransome answered frankly: [...] "Well, just then I had my doubts about you; now I figure that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> {{can do a}} thing, you can. Come over to the ranch, and, if we can't make a deal, I'll give you a week's work, any way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Zoola, I obey. I {{think that}} <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> will go, none, not the King himself, would dare to stay you, though {{you would have}} to go on foot, for then that horse would die. But an impi would go with you, or before you, and woe betide those who held you from {{returning}} to Zululand! Do you understand me now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know the}} name," [...] Forrest remarked. [...] "They {{are a very}} old Roman Catholic family. We'll come and dine, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> that <b>you</b> can arrange it. But I don't {{see how we can}} all hope to get an {{invitation}} out of him on such a short acquaintance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's nonsense, father. Where has {{the money}} gone to? Whatever you do, speak the truth. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> choose to <b>say</b> <b>you</b> won't--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{need not}} {{hesitate}} in speaking to me," [...] he said. [...] "I'm quite {{fully aware that}} the whole tendency {{of the world of}} to-day is against Nicaragua and against me. I shall not consider it any diminution of your evident courtesy <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> what <b>you</b> think of the misfortunes that have laid my republic in ruins." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don’t {{want you}} to die for me," [...] said Joan with a little laugh, [...] "but I was {{thinking}} over things the other day, and I got {{an idea of how}} you could help me if you would. I gave it up, however. I felt sure you wouldn’t do it, but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> would die for me— ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's disgraceful," [...] she said. [...] "You know it is. The {{whole house}} is disgraceful. The {{children}} are disgraceful. I'M disgraceful. Pa's miserable, and no wonder! Priscilla drinks--she's always drinking. It's a great shame {{and a great}} story of you <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> didn't smell her to-day. It was as bad as a public-house, waiting at dinner; you know it was!" ...|$|E
60|$|Dr. Swinburne and Mr. Gillett are here, {{having been}} refused, as they say, by the War Department, {{permission}} {{to go to the}} Army of the Potomac. They now appeal to me, saying you wish them to go. I suppose they have been excluded by a rule which experience has induced the department to deem proper; still they shall have leave to go, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> desire it. Please answer.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{can give}} a reason,--a good reason,--a reason which I cannot oppose, though it must be fatal to me unless I can remove it; a reason to which I must succumb if necessary, but to which, Marion, I will not succumb at once. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> that <b>you</b> cannot love me {{that will be a}} reason." ...|$|R
60|$|RICHARD (worriedly). I {{have told}} them truth enough to hang me ten times over. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> another word <b>you</b> will risk other lives; but you will not save mine.|$|R
5000|$|... “You {{know better}} {{in your own}} self that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are upon the truth and you are calling towards the truth go forth, for people more honourable than you were killed and have been killed, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are not upon the truth, then what an evil son you are, you have {{destroyed}} yourself {{and those who are}} with <b>you.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> what <b>you</b> <b>say,</b> that <b>you</b> are upon the truth and you will be killed at the hands of others then you will not truly be free, for this is not the statement of someone who is free... How long will you live in this world, death is more beloved to me than this state you are on, this state of weakness.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{there was}} a time when you turned to me, before I thought of you! I don't reproach you, for even now I feel that the ignorant and cold {{darkness}} that I should have lived in if you had not attracted me by that letter--valentine you call it--would have been worse than my knowledge of you, though it has brought this misery. But, I say, {{there was a}} time when I knew nothing of you, and cared nothing for you, and yet you drew me on. And <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> gave me no encouragement, I cannot but contradict you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't say that," [...] said Gwendolen, hurriedly, {{feeling that}} this might be her only chance of getting the words uttered, and {{dreading}} the increase of her own agitation. [...] "If you despair of me, I shall despair. Your saying that I should not go on being selfish and ignorant has been some strength to me. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> wish you had not meddled--that means you despair of me and forsake me. And then you will decide for me that I shall not be good. It is you who will decide; because you might have made me different by keeping as near to me as you could, and believing in me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Everybody {{seems so}} beastly slack now," [...] {{continued}} Allardyce. [...] "It's considered the thing. You're looked on as an awful blood <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> haven't done {{a stroke of}} work for a week. I shouldn't mind that so much if they were some good at anything. But they can't do a thing. The footer's rotten, the gymnasium six {{is made up of}} kids an inch high--we shall probably be about ninetieth at the Public Schools' Competition--and there isn't any one who can play racquets for nuts. The only thing that Wrykyn'll do this year is to get the Light-Weights at Aldershot. Drummond ought to manage that. He won the Feathers last time. He's nearly a stone heavier now, and awfully good. But he's the only man we shall send up, I expect. Now that O'Hara and Moriarty are both gone, he's the only chap we have who's up to Aldershot form. And nobody else'll take the trouble to practice. They're all too slack." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know his}} position, Wyandotté, and can aid us materially, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will. What <b>say</b> <b>you,</b> chief; {{will you take}} service, once more, under your old commander?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{manager of}} the Express Company said: [...] "I'm sorry you're leaving us, and I hope you'll return to us soon. I'll hold the place open for <b>you,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's what. Here's where I break camp. I can't {{go on this}} way. I've got {{the worst}} fever anybody ever had, I reckon. I can't eat or sleep or work, just on account of {{studying}} about you. You've got me goin' in a circle, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>say</b> <b>you</b> forgive me--it's me to the bone-yard, and that's no joke, you'll find." ...|$|R
60|$|Then stood forth Captain Conviction and said--his was {{the pale}} colours, {{and for an}} escutcheon, he had {{the book of the}} law wide open [from whence issued a flame of fire]--'Hear, O Mansoul! Thou, O Mansoul, wast once famous for innocency, but now thou art {{degenerated}} into lies and deceit (Rom 3:3,10-23, 16:17,18). Thou hast heard what my brother the Captain Boanerges hath said; and it is your wisdom, and will be your happiness, to stoop to, and accept of, conditions of peace and mercy when offered; especially when offered by one against whom thou hast rebelled, and one who is of power to tear thee in pieces, for so is Shaddai our King; nor, when he is angry, can anything stand before him (Psa 1:21,22). <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> have not sinned, nor acted rebellion against our King, the whole of your doings, since the day that you cast off his service--and there was the beginning of your sin--will sufficiently testify against you. What else means your hearkening to the tyrant, and your receiving him for your king? What means else your rejecting of the laws of Shaddai, and your obeying of Diabolus? Yea, what means this your taking up of arms against, and the shutting of your gates upon us, the faithful servants of your King? Be ruled then, and accept of my brother's invitation, and overstand not the time of mercy, but agree with thine adversary quickly (Luke 12:58,59). Ah, Mansoul, suffer not thyself to be kept from mercy, and to be run into a thousand miseries, by the flattering wiles of Diabolus. Perhaps that piece of deceit may attempt to make you believe that we seek our own profit in this our service;[102] but know, it is obedience to our King, and love to your happiness, that is the cause of this undertaking of ours.|$|E
60|$|Then stood forth Captain Conviction, and said, (his {{were the}} pale colours, {{and for a}} scutcheon he had {{the book of the}} law wide open, etc.,) 'Hear, O Mansoul!

6000|$|The {{season was}} said to begin very late, and it {{was said to}} be a very [...] "bad" [...] season, {{throughout}} May, when the charges of those who live by it ordinarily feel an expansive rise; when rooms at hotels become difficult, become impossible; when the rents of apartments double themselves, and apartments are often not to be had at any price; when the face of the cabman clouds <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> want him by the hour, and clears if you add that you will make it all right with him; when every form of service begins to have the courage of its dependence; and the manifold fees which ease the social machine seem to lubricate it so much less than the same fees in April; when the whole vast body of London groans with a sense of repletion such as no American city knows except in the rare congestion produced by a universal exposition or a national convention. Such a congestion is of annual occurrence in London, and is the symptomatic expression of the season; but the symptoms ordinarily recognizable in May were absent until June in the actual year. They were said to have been suppressed by the reluctance of the tardy spring, and again by the king's visit to Ireland. As the king is the fountain of social prosperity it is probable that he {{had more to do with}} delaying the season than the weather had; but by what one hears said of him he would not have willingly delayed it. He is not only a well-meaning and well-doing prince, one hears from people of every opinion, but a promoter of peace and international concord (especially with France, where his good offices are believed to have been peculiarly effective), and he is, rather more expectedly, a cheerful sovereign, loving the gayety as well as the splendor of state, and fond of seeing the world enjoy itself.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are {{not going}} {{the right way to}} work, Sir," [...] he said, with severity. [...] "You {{are not going}} the right way to work to--a--have your case treated with special consideration. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> had simply {{expressed}} regret for what you had done, I should have been strongly inclined to dismiss the matter as an outbreak of temper.

6000|$|... “What <b>say</b> <b>you,</b> my friend,” {{cried the}} traveller, turning pleasantly to Natty’s companion; “shall we toss up this dollar for the honor, {{and you keep}} the silver <b>if</b> <b>you</b> lose; what <b>say</b> <b>you,</b> friend?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Take your answer, Mr Corporal," [...] said Cathelineau: [...] "had Peter Berrier {{intended}} to have joined you {{he would not}} have troubled you to come across the square to fetch him.
