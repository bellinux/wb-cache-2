40|$|The {{clinical}} {{suspicion of}} local recurrence {{of prostate cancer}} after radical treatment {{is based on the}} onset of biochemical failure. The use of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for prostate cancer has increased over recent years, mainly for detection, staging, and active surveillance. However, suspicion of recurrence in the set of biochemical failure is becoming a significant reason for clinicians to request multiparametric MRI.

Methods and Materials: This study included 21 patients who underwent CHOL-PET and T 2 W-/DW-MRI prior to radical prostatectomy. Two observers manually delineated IPL contours for each scan, and automatic IPL contours were generated on CHOL-PET based on varying proportions of the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV). IPLs identified on prostatectomy specimens defined the reference standard contours. The imaging-based contours were compared with the reference standard contours using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), sensitivity and specificity. Factors that could potentially predict the DSC of the best contouring method were analyzed using linear models. Results: The best automatic contouring method, SUV 60, had similar correlations (DSC 0. 59) with the manual PET contours (DSC 0. 52, P= 0. 127) and significantly better correlations than the manual MRI contours (DSC 0. 37, P< 0. 001). The sensitivity and specificity values were 72 % and 71 % for SUV 60; 53 % and 86 % for PET manual contouring; and 28 % and 92 % for MRI manual contouring. The tumor volume and transition zone pattern could independently predict the accuracy of CHOL-PET. Conclusions: CHOL-PET is superior to the combination of T 2 W- and DW-MRI for delineating IPLs.

Local diffusion is expected to correlate better than perfusion with cancer microvascular growth and, therefore, aggressiveness. Local diffusion is estimated by transrectal ultrasound imaging of an ultrasound contrast-agent bolus passing through the prostate circulation after a peripheral intravenous injection. A time-intensity curve (TIC) is measured at each pixel by acoustic quantification. The measured TICs are fitted by a modified Local Density Random Walk model, a solution of the convective diffusion equation that provides a physical representation of the diffusion process.
