50|$|Sylvania Lighting Division in Salem and Danvers, MA, {{produced}} and marketed an EL night lamp (right), under the trade name Panelescent {{at roughly the}} same time that the Chrysler instrument panels entered production. These lamps have proven incredibly reliable, with some samples known to be still functional after nearly 50 years of continuous operation. Later in the 1960s, Sylvania's Electronic Systems Division in Needham, MA developed and manufactured several instruments for the Apollo Lunar Lander and Command Module using <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>display</b> panels manufactured by the Electronic Tube Division of Sylvania at Emporium, PA. Raytheon, Sudbury, MA, manufactured the Apollo guidance computer, which used a Sylvania <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>display</b> panel as part of its display-keyboard interface (DSKY).|$|E

Our approach adapt new printed electronics technology for fabrication of elastic <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>displays</b> with lamination process which {{is impossible to}} replace {{in the production of}} such cards. Polycarbonate foils used as regular materials for such types of cards are used with specially developed transparent electrodes with double walled carbon nanotubes, dielectric and luminophore ink, deposited with spray coating technique. Silver nanopowder ink is printed as the bottom electrode with an ink-jet printer. In our solution the display can be integrated in cards only by printing and lamination without the use of additional processes or introducing additional electronic components...|$|R
40|$|A {{breakthrough}} in the complementary thin-film transistor technology allows the production of voltage level shifters that raise a 5 -V input span to an 80 -V output span. The static and dynamic behavior of these level shifters is discussed.

5000|$|The Integral PC was a mains-powered {{portable}} {{computer with a}} 9-inch amber <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>display</b> with a resolution of 512×255 pixels or 80×28 characters. It also incorporated a 710 kB 3.5" [...] floppy disk drive and an HP ThinkJet ink-jet printer. Standard memory capacity was 256 kB ROM plus 512 kB RAM, expandable to 1.5 MB. Expansion slots and an HP-IB bus were also included. The mechanical design {{was based on the}} ideas of the de facto standard HP-85.|$|E
5000|$|The MR-Fxx series {{consisted}} of the MR-F10, MR-F20, and MR-F30. They were only available in Asia. They were all available with 512MB and 1GB flash memory, except the MR-F20 which only came in 512MB. They all had color screens with varying resolutions and color depth. The MR-F10 and MR-F20 had 65,536-colour organic electroluminescent displays, and the MR-F30 had a 262,144-color organic <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>display.</b> The MR-F10 was available in pearl white or gloss black, and came with an earbud neckstrap.|$|E
5000|$|There {{was also}} a [...] "portable" [...] version of the Series 200 called the Integral. The {{official}} model was the HP9807. This machine was {{about the size of}} a portable sewing machine, contained a MC68000 processor, ROM based HP-UX, 3½ inch floppy drive, inkjet printer, a keyboard, mouse, and an <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>display</b> similar to the early GRiD Compass computers. It was not battery powered, and unlike the other Series 200's that were manufactured in Fort Collins, Colorado, it was manufactured in Corvallis, Oregon.|$|E
40|$|A high {{permittivity}} composite is developed {{to enhance the}} brightness of stretchable <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>displays.</b> The unique two-step assembly process yields dense layers, in which the voids around the electroluminescent particles are filled with smaller high dielectric particles.

40|$|An {{overview}} of emissive display technologies is presented. Display types briefly described include: cathode ray tubes (CRTs), field emission <b>displays</b> (FEDs), <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>displays</b> (ELDs), and plasma display panels (PDPs). The critical role of phosphors in {{further development of}} the latter three flat panel emissive display technologies is outlined. The need for stable, efficient red, green, and blue phosphors for RGB fall color displays is emphasized...|$|R
50|$|<b>Electroluminescent</b> <b>Displays</b> (ELDs) are {{a type of}} Flat {{panel display}} created by {{sandwiching}} a layer of electroluminescent material such as GaAs between two layers of conductors. When current flows, the layer of material emits radiation {{in the form of}} visible light. Electroluminescence (EL) is an optical and electrical phenomenon where a material emits light in response to an electric current passed through it, or to a strong electric field.|$|R
5000|$|T. P. [...] "Peter" [...] Brody (18 April 1920 Budapest, Hungary - 18 September 2011 Pittsburgh, PA, United States) was a British-naturalised {{physicist}} and the co-inventor of Active Matrix Thin-Film Transistor display technology together with Fang-Chen Luo, having produced the world's first Active Matrix Liquid Crystal Display (AM-LCD) in 1972 {{and the first}} functional AM-EL (<b>electroluminescent</b> <b>display)</b> in 1973 while employed by Westinghouse Electric Corporation in Pittsburgh. Brody coined the term [...] "active matrix" [...] and first used it in a published journal article in 1975.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to X Window support, the VT1000 and VT1200 could also emulate DEC's previous text terminals in individual windows, including {{support for the}} VT52, VT100, VT220 and VT320. The basic model shipped with a 15-inch CRT monitor and cost $2,895, but could be upgraded to a 19-inch display for an additional $700, or a 19-inch flat-screen <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>display</b> for an additional $11,100. All of the displays were 1024x864 resolution. They shipped with 1 MB of RAM, but could be upgraded to 4 MB for $600 per megabyte. The VT1000 {{was replaced by the}} VT1200 in the fall of 1991. This was essentially the same machine with a code upgrade.|$|E
50|$|The design used a {{clamshell}} case (where {{the screen}} folds flat {{to the rest}} of the computer when closed), which was made from a magnesium alloy. The computer featured an Intel 8086 processor, a 320 × 240-pixel <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>display,</b> 340-kilobyte magnetic bubble memory, and a 1,200 bit/s modem. Devices such as hard drives and floppy drives could be connected via the IEEE-488 I/O (also known as the GPIB or General Purpose Instrumentation Bus). This port made it possible to connect multiple devices to the addressable device bus. It weighed 5 kg (11 lb). The power input is ~110/220 V AC, 47-66 Hz, 75 W.|$|E
50|$|Electroluminescence is {{the result}} of {{radiative}} recombination of electrons and holes in a material, usually a semiconductor. The excited electrons release their energy as photons - light. Prior to recombination, electrons and holes may be separated either by doping the material to form a p-n junction (in semiconductor electroluminescent devices such as light-emitting diodes) or through excitation by impact of high-energy electrons accelerated by a strong electric field (as with the phosphors in <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>displays).</b>|$|R
40|$|Magnetron {{reactive}} sputtering enables doping of this semiconductor. Proposed method of {{reactive sputtering}} combined with doping shows potential for yielding low-resistivity zinc selenide films. Zinc selenide attractive material for forming heterojunctions with other semiconductor compounds as zinc phosphide, cadmium telluride, and gallium arsenide. Semiconductor junctions promising for future optoelectronic devices, including solar cells and <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>displays.</b> Resistivities of zinc selenide layers deposited by evaporation or {{chemical vapor deposition}} too high to form practical heterojunctions...|$|R
50|$|In 1974 Suntola {{started the}} {{development}} of thin film <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>displays</b> in the Finnish company Instrumentarium Oy. He introduced the atomic layer epitaxy (ALE) technology, nowadays known as atomic layer deposition (ALD), as the solution for the manufacturing of the EL-devices which required thin films with very high dielectric strength. The technology was brought into industrial production of EL devices in mid 1980s by Lohja Corporation in Finland. Atomic Layer Deposition later {{became one of the}} key manufacturing techniques in the semiconductor device fabrication.|$|R
50|$|The first laptop in {{the modern}} form was the Grid Compass 1101, {{designed}} by Bill Moggridge in 1979-80, and released in 1983. Enclosed in a magnesium case, it introduced the now familiar clamshell design, in which the flat display folded shut against the keyboard. The computer could be run from batteries, and was equipped with a 320×200-pixel <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>display</b> and 384 kilobyte bubble memory. It was not IBM-compatible, and its high price (US$8,000-10,000) limited it to specialized applications. However, it was used heavily by the U.S. military, and by NASA on the Space Shuttle during the 1980s. The GRiD's manufacturer subsequently earned significant returns on its patent rights as its innovations became commonplace. GRiD Systems Corp. was later bought by the Tandy (now RadioShack) Corporation.|$|E
5000|$|Not {{content with}} simply {{being the first}} {{consumer}} v.32bis modem on the market, Supra {{made a number of}} improvements over existing designs. One was the use of a much smaller case, about half the size of most models. The size and shape of modems had initially been set by the original Hayes Smartmodem in 1981, and its case design was widely used a decade later in spite of the internals having shrunk in size considerably over the years. The Supra's smaller design made it much easier to fit on a desk. Additionally, Supra replaced many indicator lights with a two-digit green <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>display</b> that showed the speed of connection and other information such as [...] "RI" [...] for ring indication and [...] "CD" [...] for carrier detect. Later models such as the LC ("Low Cost") used individual lamps that were a common feature of external modems.|$|E
40|$|Full-color, matrix-addressed <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>display</b> uses three {{different}} color phosphors located in two separate, superimposed layers to provide higher brightness, better contrast ratio, and higher resolution.

40|$|Advances in {{image quality}} {{in recent decades}} have made it {{necessary}} to develop new technologies for producing displays to meet remarkably stricter standards. The display market is governed mainly by liquid crystal display and lightemitting diode (LED) technology; however, it suffers from limitations that can be overcome by developing {{the next generation of}} <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>displays.</b> The introduction of colloidal quantum dots (QDs) as down-converters has enabled the production of displays with extremely high color purity and gamut. Therefore, colloidal nanocrystals are excellent candidates for the preparation of electroluminescent devices, which represent a straightforward approach to the development of unprecedented high-quality displays. We synthesized light-emitting QDs covering the entire visible spectrum with high fluorescence quantum yields and color purity, and produced high-brightness single-color LEDs with external quantum efficiencies of 0. 39 %, 1. 04 %, 2. 10 %, and 1. 30 % for red-, orange-, green-, and blue-emitting dots, respectively. Additionally, white LEDs were prepared by mixing QDs; they showed color temperatures of 5, 300 K and color rendering indices exceeding 80 %. Very importantly, we exhaustively characterized the LED performance, including the response time, stability, and evolution of the light characteristics, thus providing crucial information toward the development of high-quality <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>displays...</b>|$|R
40|$|Searching new more {{effective}} materials for organic <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>displays</b> is continuing. The polymethine dyes is {{a class of}} organic materials that are very interesting for these purposes. Films of the polymethine dyes were deposited by evaporation in vacuum. Also deposited were dye-filled polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) films. Kinetics of growth and heating the films were observed using optical spectroscopy in situ. It was found out {{the influence of the}} chemical structure of dyes on growth and heating kinetics of the dye films. It was found that PTFE matrix strongly enhances dye stability...|$|R
40|$|The {{retrofitting}} {{of advanced}} avionics to in-service aircraft {{in order to}} increase operational safety and flexibility, and reduce operating costs is analyzed. Research in flight management planning and airborne guidance for full-and cost-effective flight is examined. The use of CRTs and thin film <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>displays</b> in aircraft is described. The development of more accurate and reliable fuel gauges using nuclear-based techniques or volumetric measurements to evaluate fluid levels is studied. Advances in airspace systems, such as the Microwave Landing System, and Air Traffic Control Beacon System/Select Mode, the Traffic Advisory and Collision Advance System, and satellite-based communications, navigation, and surveillance are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{invention}} is a multi-color luminescent display comprising an insulator substrate and {{a single}} layer of host material which may be a phosphor deposited thereon that hosts one or more differential impurities, therein forming a pattern of selected and distinctly colored phosphors such as blue, green, and red phosphors {{in a single layer}} of host material. Transparent electrical conductor means may be provided for subjecting selected portions of the pattern of colored phosphors to an electric field thereby forming a multi-color, single layer <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>display...</b>|$|E
40|$|Thin film <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>displays</b> are {{attractive}} commercially {{as well as}} scientifically and of technological interest {{in the design of}} large area, flat screen displays. The interest in developing reliable luminescent materials for applications on flat panel displays has produced a considerable research effort in this area. This effort has been directed to the techniques of film deposition {{as well as to the}} different types of materials and dopants used as active components on electroluminescent devices. Applications of ZnS and ZnS:Mn films in <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>displays</b> have been increasing examined. Mn-doped ZnS is one of the most studied materials for luminescent devices. Zinc sulphide is a semiconductor suitable to be used as host matrix for a large variety of dopants because of its wide energy band gap. The sol-gel process is now well accepted as a technology for preparing thin films. The advantages of the sol-gel process are that it is simple and inexpensive and has the general advantages of producing large area, high purity, homogeneous films at relative low temperatures. <b>Electroluminescent</b> thin film <b>display</b> structures require the fabrication of insulators, transparent conductors and electroluminescent materials. In this project all of these materials have been produced using the sol-gel technique. Insulating films of silicon dioxide and aluminium oxide were fabricated from silicon and aluminium alkoxides respectively and their characteristics measured. Transparent conductors were produced from aluminium-doped zinc oxide using a zinc acetate precursor. The dependence of electrical characteristics upon aluminum concentration in the films and upon post-deposition heat treatment in vacuum was examined. The effect of changing the aluminum-to-zinc ratio from 0 - 4. 5 at. % (atomic percent) and heat treatment temperature in vacuum have been thoroughly investigated. Resistivities of (7 - 10) xl 0 ~ 4 Qcm have been achieved for ZnO:Al films with Al/Zn 0. 8 at. % heated to 450 °C in vacuum. Transmittance in the visible region is above 90 %. Similar results were obtained using aluminum chloride and aluminum nitrate as the aluminum precursor. Electroluminescent films of zinc sulphide were produced by a novel method involving sol-gel deposition of zinc oxide and a conversion technique where the films were annealed in a sulphiding atmosphere to produce zinc sulphide. The characteristics of these films were investigated using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy and optical transmission spectroscopy. Electroluminescent devices were fabricated using manganese and terbium doped zinc sulphide and the luminescent characteristics of the displays were measured as a function of dopant concentration, applied voltage, driving frequency and insulator type. It is has been demonstrated that the sol-gel technique is a simple, cheap method for the construction of <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>displays...</b>|$|R
40|$|A novel {{transparent}} {{electrode system}} has been developed for thin film <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>displays</b> in which the poor conductivity of the indium-tin-oxide (ITO) electrodes has been augmented by high-conductivity buses of thick aluminum or silver. The augmented electrode system consists of patterned ITO electrodes, 200 Fm wide, centered over narrow aluminum or silver lines 40 ~m wide and separated by an intermediate diffusion barrier film of titanium to promote adhesion to the ITO and prevent blackening of the main ITO electrode by interfacial reactions. The sheet resistances of the augmented ITO electrodes (A 1 -Ti-ITO and Ti-Ag-Ti-ITO) were lowered by two orders of magnitude relative to the unaugmented ITO electrodes, yielding absolute values {{on the order of}} 0. 1 ~/s...|$|R
40|$|International audienceRecent {{advances}} in materials science research have enabled {{the production of}} highly stretchable sensors and displays. However, such technologies are not yet accessible to non-expert makers. We present a novel and inexpensive fabrication method for creating Stretchis, highly stretchable user interfaces that combine sensing capabilities and visual output. We use Polydimethylsiloxan (PDMS) as the base material for a Stretchi and show how to embed stretchable touch and proximity sensors and stretchable <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>displays.</b> Stretchis can be ultra-thin, flexible, and fully customizable, enabling non-expert makers to add interaction to elastic physical objects, shape-changing surfaces, fabrics, and the human body.

40|$|Investigations of planar {{electroluminescent}} multipurpose displays with latch-in memory are described. An 18 x 24 in. flat, thin address {{panel with}} elements spacing of 0. 100 in. was constructed which demonstrated essentially uniform luminosity of 3 - 5 foot lamberts {{for each of}} its 43200 EL cells. A working model of a 4 -bit EL-PC (electroluminescent photoconductive) electrooptical decoder was made which demonstrated the feasibility of this concept. A single-diagram <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>display</b> device with photoconductive-electroluminescent latch-in memory was constructed which demonstrated the conceptual soundness of this principle. Attempts to combine these principles in a single PEL multipurpose display with latch-in memory were unsuccessful and were judged to exceed the state-of-the-art for close-packed (0. 10 in. centers) photoconductor-electroluminescent cell assembly...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} produce low-cost, hierarchically-structured and nanopatterned {{inorganic}} materials could potentially revolutionize the way we fabricate photovoltaic, energy storage, and optoelectronic devices. In nature, many organisms carry out the hierarchical assembly of metal oxide materials through cellular and biochemical processes that replicate periodic micro- and nanoscale features by a bottom-up approach at ambient conditions. For example, single-celled algae called diatoms produce a nanostructured amorphous silica skeleton called a frustule. The insertion of other metal oxide materials such as titanium or germanium dioxide into the nanostructure of the diatom frustule could potentially be utilized to fabricate new dye-sensitized solar cells, nanostructured battery electrodes, and <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>display</b> devices. The exploitation of diatom nanobiotechnology {{for the development of}} novel device concepts in these areas is overviewed...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to get a better {{understanding}} of the different ways printed circuits could be constructed and then implemented into creative, visual designs for printed <b>electroluminescent</b> <b>displays.</b> A variety of circuit design variables, such as area and length, were tested that will help create solutions for printed electronics. This study tested different variables of circuit design, such as length of silver traces and the size of the image area, to help optimize ways to build a printed circuit. Then, findings were implemented into a segmented graphic display in order to analyze innovative ways to utilize multiple displays in a small area. Results found that there are a variety of recommendations that can be considered when designing an <b>electroluminescent</b> segment <b>display.</b> However, future testing can be done to develop wiring the power supply to the design. 3 Acknowledgements We would like to thank both the California Polytechnic State University Graphic Communication and Electrical Engineering Departments for the knowledge and support in completing this senior project.
