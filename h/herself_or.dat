5|$|By all accounts, Kanhopatra then died at {{the feet}} of the Vithoba image, but the {{circumstances}} were unclear. According to popular tradition, Kanhopatra merged with the image of Vithoba in a form of marriage—something that Kanhopatra longed for. Other theories suggest that she killed <b>herself,</b> <b>or</b> that she was killed for her rebelliousness.|$|E
5|$|Coolbrith {{had hoped}} to tour the East Coast and Europe with Miller, but stayed behind in San Francisco because she felt obliged {{to care for her}} mother and her seriously ill, widowed sister Agnes who was unable to care for <b>herself</b> <b>or</b> for her two children. In late 1871 she took on the care of another {{dependent}} when Joaquin Miller brought her a teenaged Indian girl (widely rumored to be his own daughter) to care for while he went abroad again, this time to Brazil and Europe.|$|E
5|$|To Kill a Mockingbird was Lee's only {{published}} book until Go Set a Watchman, {{an earlier}} draft of To Kill a Mockingbird, was published on July 14, 2015.

5|$|After the match, an in {{ring segment}} {{took place in}} which The Big Show, entered the ring and asked the crowd whether they thought {{he should have been}} in the Championship Scramble for the WWE Championship. SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero, who portrays an {{on-screen}} authority figure for the SmackDown brand, then came to the ring and proceeded to insult the Big Show, and demanded that he leave the ring. Druids then came to the ring bringing a casket, and The Undertaker appeared on the TitanTron, telling Guerrero to either get in the casket <b>herself</b> <b>or</b> he would put her in it. Guerrero refused to enter the casket voluntarily, so The Undertaker began to come to ringside. The Big Show held back Guerrero as The Undertaker came to the ring. Once he was in the ring, The Undertaker began to choke Guerrero, but the Big Show turned heel, becoming a villainous character, by striking The Undertaker and freeing Guerrero. He proceeded to attack The Undertaker, and restrained him to allow Guerrero to slap him and spit in his face.|$|E
5|$|Farrar {{admitted}} that the marriage was never ideal. He later said that neither had expressed their love to each other, even at {{the early stages of}} marriage. Farrar recounted that Green seemed to lack the coping skills most adults bring to bear in challenging times; when she went into a rage, she sometimes harmed <b>herself</b> <b>or</b> broke things, and rarely gave any thought to whether she was in private or in public during these episodes. By the early 1990s, Farrar worked long hours away from the home to avoid arguments and what he perceived as his wife's shortcomings as a homemaker. When the couple fought, Green responded by treating the children, especially Tim, as small adults and telling them about what their father had done wrong. Swayed by their mother's opinions about their father, the children began to resent and disobey Farrar, to the point where Timothy and Farrar had physical altercations.|$|E
5|$|In August 1701, George was {{invested}} with the Order of the Garter and, within six weeks, the nearest Catholic claimant to the thrones, the former king James II, died. William III died the following March and was succeeded by Anne. Sophia became heiress presumptive {{to the new}} Queen of England. Sophia was in her seventy-first year, older than Anne by thirty-five years, but she was very fit and healthy and invested time and energy in securing the succession either for <b>herself</b> <b>or</b> her son. However, it was George who understood the complexities of English politics and constitutional law, which required further acts in 1705 to naturalise Sophia and her heirs as English subjects, and to detail arrangements for the transfer of power through a Regency Council. In the same year, George's surviving uncle died and he inherited further German dominions: the Principality of Lüneburg-Grubenhagen, centred at Celle.|$|E
5000|$|Definition of {{the term}} [...] "disabled person" [...] as [...] "any person unable to ensure by himself <b>or</b> <b>herself,</b> wholly <b>or</b> partly, the necessities of a normal {{individual}} and/or social life, {{as a result of}} deficiency, either congenital or not, in his or her physical or mental capabilities".|$|R

5|$|The {{crinoline}} {{needed to}} be rigid enough to support the skirts in their accustomed shape, but also flexible enough to be temporarily pressed out of shape and spring back afterwards. Other materials used for crinolines included whalebone, gutta-percha and vulcanised caoutchouc (natural rubber). The idea of inflatable hoops was short-lived as they were easily punctured, prone to collapse, and due {{to the use of}} brimstone in the manufacture of rubber, they smelled unpleasant. Although hard rubber hoops of gutta-percha worked satisfactorily at first, they were brittle and easily crushed without recovering their form. Despite objections that the sharp points of snapped steels were hazardous, lightweight steel was clearly the most successful option. It reduced the number of petticoats and their weight, and offered increased freedom of movement of the legs. However, hasty or careless movements in a hoop skirt could lead to accidentally revealing more than intended. An advertisement published in The Lady's Newspaper in 1863 for a cage crinoline with waved hoops attempted to reassure the potential customer that while wearing it, activities such as climbing stairs, passing to her theatre seat, dropping into armchairs and leaning against furniture would be possible without hindrance either to <b>herself</b> <b>or</b> to others around her.|$|E

25|$|In 1778, Samuel {{painted the}} women on a {{speculative}} basis without taking sittings {{in an attempt to}} advance his career as a portrait and history painter. The resulting work was exhibited at the exhibition in 1778 where it attracted little attention. The figures in the painting were so idealised, possibly {{because of the lack of}} sittings, that Elizabeth Carter complained that she couldn't identify <b>herself</b> <b>or</b> anyone else in the picture.|$|E

25|$|The events {{begin the}} same way as the security-based strategy. A person {{perceives}} something that triggers anxiety, and the person tries to reduce anxiety by seeking physical or psychological closeness to her or his attachment. But the attachment is either unavailable or rebuffs the request for closeness. The lack of responsiveness fuels insecurity and heightens anxiety. The person gives up on getting a positive response from the attachment, suppresses her or his anxiety, and distances <b>herself</b> <b>or</b> himself from the attachment.|$|E
25|$|When a Chinaman {{is called}} {{back to his own}} home in China proper, or a Chinese soldier has served his time in Turkestan and has to return to his native city of Pekin or Shanghai, he either leaves his {{temporary}} wife behind to shift for <b>herself,</b> <b>or</b> he sells her to a friend. If he has a family he takes the boys with him~—if he can afford it—failing that, the sons are left alone and unprotected to fight the battle of life, While in the case of daughters, he sells them to one of his former companions for a trifling sum.|$|E
50|$|Name-dropping {{is used to}} {{position}} oneself within a social hierarchy. It {{is often used to}} create a sense of superiority by raising one's status. By implying (or directly asserting) a connection to people of high status, the name-dropper hopes to raise his or her own social status to a level closer to that of those whose names he or she has dropped, and thus elevate himself <b>or</b> <b>herself</b> above, <b>or</b> into, present company.|$|R

25|$|The {{beginning}} of pregnancy may be detected either based on symptoms {{by the woman}} <b>herself,</b> <b>or</b> by using pregnancy tests. However, an important condition with serious health implications that is quite common is the denial of pregnancy by the pregnant woman. About one in 475 denials will last until around the 20th week of pregnancy. The proportion of cases of denial, persisting until delivery is about 1 in 2500. Conversely, some non-pregnant women {{have a very strong}} belief that they are pregnant along with some of the physical changes. This condition is known as a false pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|Electroconvulsive {{therapy is}} a {{controversial}} form of treatment which cannot be involuntarily applied in psychiatric emergency service settings. Instances wherein {{a patient is}} depressed to such a severe degree that the patient cannot be stopped from hurting himself or <b>herself</b> <b>or</b> when a patient refuses to swallow, eat or drink medication, electroconvulsive therapy could be suggested as a therapeutic alternative. While preliminary research suggests that electroconvulsive therapy may be an effective treatment for depression, it usually requires a course of six to twelve sessions of convulsions lasting at least 20 seconds for those antidepressant effects to occur.|$|E
25|$|Abortion {{is illegal}} in Brazil {{except for the}} case of rape or when the mother's life is in danger. Though abortions are against the law, it is {{estimated}} that over one million abortions are performed in Brazil each year, though data on abortion incidence is not systemically collected. Over two hundred thousand women are treated for abortion complications each year in Brazilian hospitals. The punishment for a woman performing an abortion on <b>herself</b> <b>or</b> consenting to an abortion is one to three years of imprisonment. The punishment for those performing abortions is one to four years of imprisonment, and this number increases by one-third if harm is caused to the women or one-half if the abortion leads to the death of the woman.|$|E
