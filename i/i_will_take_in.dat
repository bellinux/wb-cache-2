One of the conclusions of the analysis is that legal regulation of parental leave in Italy, although it is quite appreciated also at the international level, is still highly traditional, operating exclusively as conciliation instrument of female roles...|$|E

His {{most recent}} book is The Manhattan Project: A Theory of a City, just {{released}} in paperback by Stanford University Press. Runtime: 27 : 22 minutesUrban theology begins with a biblical tale of two cities: Enoch, built by Cain, and Babel, destroyed by God. The fact that the pithy primeval story in Genesis 1 - 11 finds it necessary to develop separate critiques of the same phenomenon (soon to be tripled with the account of Sodom and Gomorrah) is enough to show why the city is seen not only as the foundation of the created world, but also as the fountain of our deepest human anxieties. Assuming that all our modern urban sensibilities are secularized theological sensibilities, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>in</b> this talk a tiger’s leap from the observation deck of the World Trade Center to the locked room at the seventh floor of the Babylonian Ziggurat...|$|E
40|$|Repetition is a {{phenomenon}} that is pervasive {{in the world around}} us. In biology repetition {{can be seen in the}} asexual reproduction of some animals, where an animal reproduces an identical version of itself. Biologically repetition is also seen in twins where one zygote splits into two, producing genetically identical repetitions of the same organism. In culture repetition can be seen in artwork. Andy Warhol is one example of an artist who utilized repetition in his works. Repetition is also a fundamental aspect of language and communication. Repetition can be found in poetry, literature, gestures, and spoken language. Repetitions do not need to be exact. Repetitions also include partial repetitions and paraphrases. Concentrating on the spoken language aspect, interactional sociolinguists describe repetition as a fundamental building block of everyday language use (Tannen, 2007; Hengst, Duff, & Dettmer, 2010). The interactional sociolinguistic approach contrasts with those who take a deficit model approach. In the deficit model approach repetition is viewed as an unwanted disruption in speech production (Denes & Pinson, 1993; Hengst et al., 2010). The approach to repetition as being fundamental to language use and conversational repetition as an important aspect of language use is the approach that <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>in</b> this study of conversational repetition and aphasia...|$|E
40|$|What {{physical}} processes {{and sources of}} material contribute to exoplanet compositions? Specifically, what roles do the protoplanetary disk composition and structure, and host star abundances play in the different stages of planet formation? In this thesis, beginning with a brief literature review in Chapter 2, I trace oxygen and carbon species through these stages to inform how, when, and where planets form. In Chapter 3 I describe {{a study of the}} molecular emission from the warm inner disks of T Tauri stars, where terrestrial planets likely form. I report moderate correlations between HCN emission strength and both stellar accretion rate (measured from UV or optical excess emission associated with accretion) and X-ray luminosity. These correlations point towards accretion related processes being an important source of disk atmosphere heating, and suggests that efficient H₂O formation and/or UV dissociation of N₂ (both also associated with higher stellar accretion rates) may aid in the production of HCN. Studies following mine have further connected the abundance of HCN versus H₂O to the growth and migration of planetesimals in the disk, which helps control the formation of both giant and terrestrial planets. I shift to an already-formed exoplanet in Chapter 4, where I present optical photometry of the best-observed transiting super-Earth GJ 1214 b with the goal of constraining the short-wavelength slope of its transmission spectrum. Most previous observations suggested a flat spectrum from the near-IR to the optical, corresponding to a low-scale-height, high-molecular-weight atmosphere. My observations are in general agreement with these findings, keeping the "door open" for a H₂O-rich atmosphere for GJ 1214 b, which other published g-band observations appeared to contradict. Chapters 5 - 7 of my thesis focus on measuring stellar abundances, particularly C/O ratios, in transiting (mostly) hot Jupiter exoplanet host stars from high resolution optical spectroscopy. Host star abundances may indicate the precursor materials present in the disk and available for incorporation into planets. In hot Jupiters, the C/O ratio affects the partitioning of C in the major observable molecules, making C and O diagnostic of temperature structure and composition. I also demonstrate that extra caution is necessary in deriving carbon and oxygen abundances, especially for cool and metal-rich stars. Though exoplanetary C/O ratios are still uncertain, the more precise abundance analysis possible right now for their host stars can help constrain their formation environments and current compositions. I summarize my graduate school research in Chapter 8, and discuss the next steps <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>in</b> my postdoctoral career...|$|E

40|$|As {{a part of}} the Frontlines Mission’s team, I joined {{their mission}} to teach, build, and restore the poor and {{indigenous}} areas of Guatemala. With the goal of combining my passion and pursuit of a dental career with public health, I joined the medical team and assisted in treatment of over 1000 Q’eqchi’ locals for a variety of conditions such as scabies, stomach ailments, asthma, arthritis, and parasites. I assisted professionals in the oral surgery procedures including multiple extractions and cleft palate cases. Perhaps most importantly for the future oral health of the Q’eqchi’ people, I was able to introduce a new aspect to the health team’s mission and educate the hundreds of men, woman, and children who came seeking care. I taught good oral health practices and {{how important it is to}} their overall systemic health. Because many are unable to read, I used a variety of interactive lessons and activities to teach them small and easy steps to keeping a healthy mouth and a healthy body. I utilized visually interactive games and activities that showed how plaque accumulates on teeth and becomes a breeding site for the production of bacteria. The importance of mechanically removing plaque on a regular basis was demonstrated as well as the aftermath of not doing so, which at this point, is their reality. My goal was not only to teach them oral hygiene methods, but also to raise awareness to the importance of implementing these methods. Because professional medical and dental are scarce in the city of Campur and the greater Alta Verapas region, encouraging preventative oral health care such as daily brushing and flossing was a crucial part of my mission. It was important to me that I was not only able to provide the information but that I was able to provide the tools for them, whether standard or primitive, to begin implementing what they were instructed, and that in doing so, it would make a positive impact on other systemic issues and their daily lives. Unfortunately, the Q’eqchi people don’t have the luxury of going to the local Wal-Mart for a toothbrush and toothpaste. The town of Campur as well as its surrounding villages is far from the civilization of a large city and the benefits that it provides. Many of the these people have little or no basic knowledge of any health practices, and I wanted this project and mission to be a first of many humanitarian approaches that <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>in</b> my life and in my career to improve the human civilization both near and far. I am hopeful that my experience will create awareness of just how great the global need is in this field as well as how we all can continue to make a difference both now and in the future...|$|E
