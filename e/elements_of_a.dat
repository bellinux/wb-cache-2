5|$|A Deshasthas {{marriage}} ceremony includes many <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> traditional Marathi Hindu wedding ceremony. It consists of seemant poojan on the wedding eve. The dharmic wedding includes the antarpat ceremony {{followed by the}} vedic ceremony which involves the bridegroom and the bride walking around the sacred fire seven times to complete the marriage.

5|$|Images of Sophiatown were {{initially}} {{built up in}} literature by a generation of South African writers: Can Themba, Bloke Modisane, Es'kia Mphahlele, Arthur Maimane, Todd Matshikiza, Nat Nakasa, Casey Motsisi and Lewis Nkosi who all lived in Sophiatown at various stages during the 1950s. They all shared certain <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> common experience: education at St Peter's School and Fort Hare University, living in Sophiatown, working for Drum magazine, exile, banning under the Suppression of Communism Act and for many the writing of an autobiography.|$|E
5|$|Joe Dante was {{the next}} choice, {{increasing}} the budget for his idea of Daniel Day-Lewis as a brooding Mummy. This version (a draft was written by Alan Ormsby, but it was later re-written by John Sayles) was set in contemporary times and focused on reincarnation with <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> love story. It came close to being made with some elements, like the flesh-eating scarabs, {{making it to the}} final product. However, at that point, the studio wanted a film with a budget of $15million and rejected Dante's version.|$|E
5|$|Modern-day western gunslingers {{have also}} {{appeared}} in recent Neo-Westerns. Raylan Givens from the television series Justified shares the same ambiguous moral code of an Old West sheriff, even using a fast draw to dispatch his enemies. The hitman Anton Chigurh from No Country For Old Men shares many <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hunted outlaw. Additionally, the comic book character Vigilante is a self-proclaimed gunfighter born in the 1940s.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, Antillean {{music can}} be {{characterized}} by the prominence of the Carnival celebration (prominently from Trinidad and Tobago), {{and the importance of}} calypso-like song traditions. The Lesser Antilles is also home to a strong Indo-Caribbean population; though Indo-Caribbean music is found elsewhere in the Caribbean, the prominence of Indian-influenced styles is a hallmark of the Antillean music scenes. Regional forms can also be found outside of the Caribbean entirely, most notably in New York City, where Brooklyn's Labor Day Carnival features music and parades, mas and steel bands; this Carnival is distinct to New York, and reflects <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pan-Caribbean nature.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, Paul retains <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{powerful}} and alert patriarch. The painting {{is set at}} a curious angle, so that although Paul is positioned low in the pictorial space, the viewer still looks upwards towards him as if in respect. He is dressed in full pomp, wearing wide fur-lined sleeves (a typical Venetian device to convey status), and his cape is laid across his upper body to suggest physical presence.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{consisting}} of twenty chapters– one {{was cut in}} later editions– Theory of Literature describes various aspects of literary theory, criticism, and history. After defining various aspects and relationships of literature in general, Wellek and Warren divide analysis of literature based on two approaches: extrinsic, relating to factors outside a work such as the author and society, and intrinsic, relating to factors within such as rhythm and meter. They stress the {{need to focus on}} the intrinsic <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> work as the best way to truly understand it. In doing so they adapt the phenomenology used by Roman Ingarden.|$|E

In the game's back-story, {{a species of}} powerful, unknown extraterrestrials enters the Milky Way {{with the intention of}} enslaving its inhabitants.

5|$|The Albert Bridge is a {{road bridge}} over the River Thames in West London, {{connecting}} Chelsea on the north bank to Battersea on the south bank. Designed and built by Rowland Mason Ordish in 1873 as an Ordish–Lefeuvre system modified cable-stayed bridge, {{it proved to be}} structurally unsound, so between 1884 and 1887 Sir Joseph Bazalgette incorporated some of the design <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> suspension bridge. In 1973 the Greater London Council added two concrete piers, which transformed the central span into a simple beam bridge. As a result, today the bridge is an unusual hybrid of three different design styles. It is an English Heritage Grade II* listed building.|$|E

50|$|In mathematics, {{especially}} in order theory, <b>a</b> maximal <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> subset S <b>of</b> some {{partially ordered set}} (poset) is <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> S that is not smaller than any other element in S. <b>A</b> minimal <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> subset S <b>of</b> some partially ordered set is defined dually as <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> S that is not greater than any other element in S.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> general partial order, the least element (smaller than all other) {{should not be}} {{confused}} with a minimal element (nothing is smaller). Likewise, <b>a</b> greatest <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> partially ordered set (poset) is <b>an</b> upper bound <b>of</b> the set which is contained within the set, whereas <b>a</b> maximal <b>element</b> m <b>of</b> <b>a</b> poset <b>A</b> is <b>an</b> <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>A</b> such that if m ≤ b (for any b in A) then m = b. Any least element or greatest <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> poset is unique, but a poset can have several minimal or maximal elements. If a poset has more than one maximal element, then these elements will not be mutually comparable.|$|R
5|$|The Great Depression in Canada {{during the}} early 1930s saw an {{economic}} downturn, leading to hardship across the country. In response to the downturn, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in Saskatchewan introduced many <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> welfare state (as pioneered by Tommy Douglas) in the 1940s and 1950s. On the advice of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, war with Germany was declared effective September 10, 1939, by King George VI, seven days after the United Kingdom. The delay underscored Canada's independence.|$|E

The brothers each had a strong intuition for the <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> successful game. Ultimate found success with games such as Jetpac (1983), Atic Atac (1983), Sabre Wulf (1984), and Knight Lore (1984), whose expansive experiences exceeded the scope of their contemporary arcade games. The brothers outsourced the programming of their games for other platforms to outside developers, for they preferred the work of making new games over re-programming old ones.|$|E
