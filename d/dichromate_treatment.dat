40|$|Thirty nine {{methanolic}} {{extracts from}} twenty five Australian native plants were investigated for toxicity using the Artemia franciscana nauplii lethality bioassay and {{compared to the}} reference toxins potassium dichromate and Mevinphos. 7 extracts (18 %) showed marked lethality towards Artemia franciscana nauplii at 24 h, 11 extracts (28 %) at 48 h and 19 extracts (49 %) at 72 h. Of the positive controls, only Mevinphos displayed significant lethality at 24 h. Potassium <b>dichromate</b> <b>treatment</b> resulted in only approximately 10 % mortality at 24 h but induced 100 % mortality by 48 h. Of the non-toxic extracts, A. aulacocarpa leaf, L. bracteata leaf, L. juniperium leaf and flower, S. australe leaf and B. celsissima leaf extracts have previously {{been shown to be}} good antibacterial agents, confirming their potential for antibiotic usage.

40|$|Various {{light and}} {{electron}} histochemical techniques {{were applied to}} the study of developing rat adrenal medulla. Adrenal glands or rudiments were examined at 14, 16, 18, 20 days of intrauterine life, at birth and at 1 week after birth. Material was processes for light microscopy as follows: (1) for the demonstration of cortical lipids by Sudan black B; (2) by immersion in Muller's formol-dichromate for the direct chromaffin reaction (CHR); (3) by sequential glutaraldehyde fixation and subsequent <b>dichromate</b> <b>treatment</b> for the indirect CHR. For electron microscopy, material from all developmental stages was fixed in glutaraldehyde and further processed in three ways: subsequent <b>dichromate</b> <b>treatment</b> (GD); sequential dichromate and osmium tetroxide (GDO); subsequent osmium tetroxide (GO). A positive direct CHR in the developing medullary; cells and discrete sudanophilic lipid droplets in the cortical cells were observed in 18 - 20 day embryos. Although the intensity of the direct CHR increased through the developmental stages, clear distinction between adrenaline (A) and noradrenaline (NA) cells was not observed until after birth by the indirect CHR. At an ultrastuctural level 'light' and 'dark' parenchymal cells were found in the sympathomedullary rudiment medial to the cortical anlage in the 14 day embryo: these 'light' cells, the phaeochromoblasts, together with nerve fibres, invade the cortex as from this stage. Phaeochromoblasts, the adrenomedullary precursor cells, were actively dividing and possessed a cytoplasmic content of numerous polyribosomes and a few (140 nm diameter) membrane-bounded inclusion granules. In embryos of 16 - 18 days, medullary cells were variously grouped as phaeochromoblasts, as the more differentiated phaeochromocytes and as intermediate forms. Phaeochromocytes contained a mixture of high and low density secretory granules (200 nm diameter) which in GD and GDO preparations were interpreted as NA and A granules. Cholinergic nerve terminals on medullary cells, the establishment of an endocrine-type relationship between regional capillaries and medullary cells and the presence of exocytotic profiles at the surface of these cells were all features of the 18 day and subsequent developmental stages. It was not possible to differentiate in GD and GDO preparations between A and NA cells {{on the basis of their}} granule typification until after birth. 'Light' and 'dark' variants of both A and NA cells observed at birth and thereafter were regarded as expressions of phase differences in the secretory cycles of these cells. The secretory granule population of medullary cells showed an overall increase during development and was especially high in the 'dark' variants of A and NA cells. Another developmental trend in the majority of medullary cells was an increase in the size of these granules (diameter range at 1 week, 160 - 330 nm); but in a few NA cells the mean granule diameter remained small (180 nm) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{electrochemical}} behaviour of an 80 Sn 20 Zn electro-deposited alloy following passivation in a dichromate {{solution and}} a cerium-containing solution, was studied. It {{was found that}} both the dichromate and cerium passivation procedures {{lead to an increase}} in the corrosion protection afforded by the 80 Sn 20 Zn electro-deposit. This was attributed to a reduction in the rate of the zinc dissolution reaction from the electro-deposit which in turn extended the cathodic protection periods of the deposit. Passivation of the electro-deposited alloy in the cerium-containing solution lead to the precipitation of cerium oxides/hydroxides in a non-uniform manner over the surface. This precipitated film of cerium had the appearance of a cracked-mud layer. Nevertheless, the additional corrosion protection afforded by the cerium passivation treatment was equivalent to that provided by the <b>dichromate</b> passivation <b>treatment...</b>|$|R

40|$|An {{electrode}} support material in fuel cells has great influence on catalyst dispersion, charge transport, and stabilization of the catalyst particles. Graphene and carbon nanotubes {{have been considered}} as a fuel cell electrode material due to their high specific surface area, exceptional electronic and mechanical properties. The mesopores in graphene nanosheets and carbon nanotube electrodes are interconnected, providing a continuous charge distribution that uses {{nearly all of the}} available surface area. In present work, for the production of advanced type of electrode materials, the distinguished properties of graphene nanosheets and multi walled carbon nanotubes were combined with the structural properties of conducting polymers (polypyrrole) by the incorporation of graphene and carbon nanotubes into a polymer matrix. Graphene nanosheets were exfoliated from graphite by a mild chemical treatment including graphite oxidation using sulphuric acid and potassium <b>dichromate,</b> ultrasonic <b>treatment,</b> and chemical reduction by hydroquinone. Pyrrole was coated on graphene nanosheets and carbon nanotubes by in situ polymerization by different feeding ratios.

40|$|Forest {{wildfire}} and stubble burning {{practices in}} agriculture {{contribute to the}} formation of black carbon (BC), a continuum of pyrogenic carbon ranging from slightly charred degradable biomass to highly condensed refractory soot. We examined the BC contribution to Andisol after a wildfire in a pristine Araucaria-Nothofagus spp. temperate rain forest and after 17 years of stubble burning on an agricultural soil. We tested the hypothesis that the severity of stubble burning and forest fire affects the quantity and composition of soil organic matter (SOM) and that fire-derived aromatic BC is the main contributor to stabilised SOM in fire-affected soil. BC contribution was analysed as the aromatic fraction of the acid dichromate oxidation residue (COREC arom). The results indicated that the BC content of agricultural soil was unaffected by the stubble burning, whereas in the forest soil, it increased with fire severity from 0. 5 % at an unburned site to up to 7 % in the topsoil severely affected by wildfire. For both ecosystems, the total C stock correlated positively with pyrophosphate extractable Al, whereas a poor or inconsistent relationship was found with BC. We conclude that aromatic BC plays a minor role in C stabilisation in these fire-affected soils due to losses most likely following transport. Aliphatic compounds were less affected by the <b>dichromate</b> oxidation <b>treatment</b> relative to the aromatic compounds than any other functional groups, emphasising the importance of alkyl C for soil C sequestration by virtue of chemical recalcitrance.

40|$|Chromium-contaminated soils {{threaten}} {{surface and}} groundwater quality at many industrial sites. In vadose zones, indigenous bacteria can reduce Cr(VI) to Cr(III), but the subsequent fate of Cr(III) and {{the roles of}} bacterial biofilms are relatively unknown. To investigate, we cultured Pseudomonas putida, a model organism for vadose zone bioremediation, as unsaturated biofilms on membranes overlaying iron-deficient solid media either containing molecular dichromate from potassium <b>dichromate</b> (Cr-only <b>treatment)</b> or with deposits of solid, dichromate-coated hematite (Fe+Cr treatment) to simulate vadose zone conditions. Controls included iron-deficient solid medium and an Fe-only treatment using solid hematite deposits. Under iron-deficient conditions, chromium exposure resulted in lower cell yield and lower amounts of cellular protein and carbohydrate, but providing iron {{in the form of}} hematite overcame these toxic effects of Cr. For the Cr and Fe+Cr treatments, Cr(VI) was completely reduced to Cr(III) that accumulated on biofilm cells and extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs). Chromium exposure resulted in elevated extracellular carbohydrates, protein, DNA, and EPS sugars that were relatively enriched in N-acetyl-glucosamine, rhamnose, glucose, and mannose. The proportions of EPS protein and carbohydrate relative to intracellular pools suggested Cr toxicity-mediated cell lysis as the origin. However, DNA accumulated extracellularly in amounts far greater than expected from cell lysis, and Cr was liberated when extracted EPS was treated with DNase. These results demonstrate that Cr accumulation in unsaturated biofilms occurs with enzymatic reduction of Cr(VI), cellular lysis, cellular association, and extracellular DNA binding of Cr(III), which altogether can facilitate localized biotic stabilization of Cr in contaminated vadose zones...|$|R
40|$|Chromium {{passivation}} treatment on tinplate {{is important in}} stabilising the active tin surface in terms of oxidation resistance, sulphide stain resistance and ensuring good lacquer adhesion properties. Through this research, the reason was explored why dip passivation <b>treatment,</b> in sodium <b>dichromate,</b> provides superior lacquer adhesion properties on tinplate compared to electrolytic sodium <b>dichromate</b> (CDC) <b>treatments.</b> A critical assessment of the current knowledge of chromium {{passivation treatment}}s on tinplate {{formed the basis of}} the experimental work. Through electrochemical and surface analytical techniques (X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy and Auger Electron Spectroscopy) both dip and CDC treated tinplate surfaces were characterised in terms of surface species. It was shown through XPS, using angle resolved techniques, that no metallic chromium forms on the tinplate surface during CDC treatments. Furthermore, a difference in chromium surface species was established for the dip and CDC processes showing additional SnO and Cr(OH) 3. nH 2 O species for the latter. Complementary to these findings, it was verified that the formation of additional chromium hydroxide species is a function of pH, governed by the applied cathodic current during the CDC process itself. The inferior adhesion properties of CDC treated tinplate were shown {{to be related to the}} difference in the respective surface species formed during dip and CDC applications.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of detecting segment-specific injury of the proximal tubule {{by means of}} urinary enzymes was investigated in rats. Urinary glutamine synthetase, an enzyme exclusively localized in the S 3 segment, and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, prevalently a S 1 -S 2, but S 3 enzyme also, were determined after single treatment with 100 mg/kg body wt. of hexachloro- 1 : 3 -butadiene (HCBD; i. p.), toxic for the S 3 segment, or 25 mg/kg body wt. of potassium dichromate (s. c.), toxic for the S 1 -S 2 segments. Excretion of total urinary proteins was also measured. In addition, a dose-response relationship was determined between three doses (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg body wt.) of HCBD and glutamine synthetase activity in urine. Glutamine synthetase activity, measured {{according to a new}} assay for urine based on modification of methods developed for organs, increased in the urine only when the S 3 segment of the proximal tubule was damaged, as demonstrated by histological findings of the kidneys. HCBD caused early excretion of the enzyme related to the necrosis of the S 3 segment, whereas potassium dichromate caused a slight increase only when the resulting lesion to this segment (vacuolization) began to develop. On the contrary, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase activity showed the peak of excretion 24 and 34 h after treatment with HCBD or potassium dichromate, respectively, according to the histological findings of necrosis of the S 3 segment (the former) and vacuolization of the S 1 -S 2 segments (the latter). Excretion of total urinary proteins reached the peak 24 h (HCBD) and 48 h (potassium <b>dichromate)</b> after <b>treatment.</b> HCBD at 200 mg/kg body wt, caused a peak of glutamine synthetase activity in urine 10 h after injection, whereas the peak caused by doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg body wt. occurred 24 h following treatment. The peak of enzyme activity in urine significantly increased with the dose. The results suggest that the measurement of urinary activity of S 3 segment-specific enzyme as glutamine synthetase allows us to detect early S 3 segment-specific injury of the proximal tubule. In addition, the method for urinary enzyme activity appears sensitive, simple and fast...|$|R
40|$|Rangelands store about 30 % of the world’s {{carbon and}} support over 120 million pastoralists globally. Adjusting the {{management}} of remote alpine pastures bears a substantial climate change mitigation potential that can provide livelihood support for marginalized pastoralists through carbon payment. Landless pastoralists in Northern Pakistan seek higher income by cropping potatoes and peas over alpine pastures. However, tilling steep slopes without terracing exposes soil to erosion. Moreover, yields decline rapidly requiring increasing fertilizer inputs. Under these conditions, carbon payment could be a feasible option to compensate pastoralists for renouncing hazardous cropping while favoring pastoral activities. The study quantifies and compares C on cropped and grazed land. The hypothesis was that cropping on alpine pastures reduces former carbon storage. The study area located in the Naran valley of the Pakistani Himalayas receives an annual average of 819 mm of rain and 764 mm of snow. Average temperatures remain below 0 °C from November to March while frost may occur all year round. A total of 72 soil core samples were collected discriminating land use (cropping, pasture), aspect (North, South), elevation (low 3000, middle 3100, and high 3200 m a. s. l.), and soil depth (shallow 0 - 10, deep 10 - 30 cm). Thirty six biomass samples were collected over the same independent variables (except for soil depth) using a 10 x 10 x 20 cm steal box inserted in the ground for each sample. Aboveground biomass and coarse roots were separated from the soil aggregate and oven-dried. Soil organic carbon (SOC) and biomass carbon (BC) were estimated through a potassium <b>dichromate</b> oxidation <b>treatment.</b> The samples were collected during {{the second week of}} October 2010 {{at the end of the}} grazing and cropping season and before the first snowfall. The data was statistically analyzed by means of a one-way analysis of variance. Results show that all variables taken separately have a significant effect on mean SOC [%]: crop/pasture 1. 33 / 1. 6, North/South 1. 61 / 1. 32, low/middle/high 1. 09 / 1. 62 / 1. 68, shallow/deep 1. 4 / 1. 53. However, for BC, only land use has a significant effect with more than twice the amount of carbon in pastures [g m- 2]: crop/pasture 127 / 318. These preliminary findings suggest that preventing the conversion of pastures into cropping fields in the Naran valley avoids an average loss of 12. 2 t C ha- 1 or 44. 8 t CO 2 eq ha- 1 representing a foreseeable compensation of 672 € ha- 1 for the Naran landless pastoralists who would renounce cropping. The ongoing study shall provide a complete picture for carbon payment integrating key aspects such as the rate of cropping encroachment over pastures per year, the methane leakage from the system due to livestock enteric fermentation, the expected cropping income vs. livestock income and the transaction costs of implementing the mitigation project, certifying it, and verifying carbon credits. A net present value over an infinite time horizon for the mitigation scenario shall be estimated on an iterative simulation to consider weather and price uncertainties. The study will also provide an estimate of the minimum price of carbon at which pastoralists would consider engaging in the mitigation activity...|$|R
