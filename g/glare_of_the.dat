Several searches during eclipses were conducted in the early 1900s, which did not reveal any vulcanoids, and observations during eclipses remain a common search method. Conventional telescopes cannot be used to search for them because the nearby Sun could damage their optics.|$|E

Several months later, when Ceres should have reappeared, Piazzi could not locate it: the mathematical tools of the time {{were not able to}} extrapolate a position from such a scant amount of data—three degrees represent less than 1% of the total orbit.|$|E

25|$|The {{mechanism}} of physical changes {{is still not}} clear. Near the summer and winter solstices, Uranus's hemispheres lie alternately either in full <b>glare</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun's rays or facing deep space. The brightening of the sunlit hemisphere is thought to result from the local thickening of the methane clouds and haze layers located in the troposphere. The bright collar at −45° latitude is also connected with methane clouds. Other changes in the southern polar region {{can be explained by}} changes in the lower cloud layers. The variation of the microwave emission from Uranus is probably caused by a changes in the deep tropospheric circulation, because thick polar clouds and haze may inhibit convection.|$|E

40|$|Artificial {{lighting}} {{is an integral}} part of our everyday life. Nowadays, a large number of people spend practically all their productive time in <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> artificial lighting system. This places considerable demands on <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> this artificial lighting system. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> indicators <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lighting system is <b>the</b> evaluation <b>of</b> <b>glare.</b> <b>The</b> UGR evaluation methodology is currently used to evaluate glare. However, the UGR rating has its limitations. These limitations include ambiguous assessments of luminaires with non-uniform luminous surface (so - called non - uniform luminaires). This diploma thesis deals with <b>the</b> issue <b>of</b> discomfort <b>glare</b> <b>of</b> non-uniform luminaires. <b>The</b> aim is to make a literature review <b>of</b> this issue. <b>The</b> first part focuses on theoretical knowledge <b>of</b> <b>glare</b> and its evaluation. Another part is an analysis of recent studies on the topic about glare from non-uniform types <b>of</b> luminaires. <b>The</b> last chapters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> thesis deal with own practical evaluation <b>of</b> <b>glare...</b>|$|R

Neither the audience nor the band knew what to expect, and both were pleasantly surprised.

It took him several minutes to realize that what he was hearing was the expression of their enthusiastic response to the band's music. On 21 April 1972, Planxty embarked on their first tour of England, which had been booked previously by Moore, and played small folk clubs in Manchester, Bolton, Leeds, Hull, Barnsley, Blackpool, Newcastle, Chester and London, to great acclaim, returning to Ireland in May.|$|E
