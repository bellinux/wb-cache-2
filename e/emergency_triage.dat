40|$|Abstract. The {{fit to the}} {{workflow}} is {{an important}} requirement for the acceptance of clinical decision support systems in practice. Clinical systems that do not satisfy this requirement {{are likely to be}} rejected by their users despite their functionality. Disruptions and deviations from the workflow may be avoided by the appropriate and careful design of interactions between the system and its users. In this paper we focus on mobile clinical decision support systems that can be used directly at the point of care for the <b>emergency</b> <b>triage.</b> We discuss the interaction design methodologies used to develop the MET (Mobile <b>Emergency</b> <b>Triage)</b> system that facilitates <b>emergency</b> <b>triage</b> of patients with various acute pain conditions. We use a scenario-based design methodology to encapsulate the user’s mental representations of tasks to accomplish, and an Object-Action-Interface model combined with the Eight Golden Rules of Interface Design to design the input and the output components of an interaction framework. We also demonstrate how we have implemented these theoretical solutions.

40|$|Purpose: This paper {{provides}} {{a summary of}} the issues associated with the <b>emergency</b> <b>triage</b> of clients who have a mental illness in order to demonstrate the complexity inherent in contempory <b>emergency</b> <b>triage</b> practice to this client group. Procedures: A review and analysis of English language peer reviewed literature and research was undertaken. Findings: Since 1993 there have been a range of initiatives implemented in Australian emergency departments that were aimed at improving the assessment and management of clients presenting with a mental illness. The assessment and subsequent response for clients presenting with a mental illness are highly variable. Currently the terminology related to mental health <b>emergency</b> <b>triage</b> is poorly defined. Many improvements in mental health service delivery have been acknowledged as beneficial to staff and clients in emergency departments. Despite this there remains a dearth of literature about mental health services operating within the specific time constructs as prescribed by the Australasian Triage Scale. Recent research suggests that the mental health descriptors within the Australasian Triage Scale may not be a reliable tool for accurate mental health triage assessment. Principle conclusions: These assertions suggest there is an imperative for further research into the practices and processes that underpin the <b>emergency</b> <b>triage</b> of, and response to, clients who have a mental illness and who present to an emergency department...|$|E

In order to assist them, we used knowledge discovery techniques based on rough set theory to develop a clinical decision model to support the triage. The model was implemented as a module for the Mobile <b>Emergency</b> <b>Triage</b> system – a clinical decision support system for the rapid <b>emergency</b> <b>triage</b> of children with acute pain. The {{abdominal pain}} module underwent a clinical trial in the Emergency Department of a teaching hospital.

The preliminary results are very encouraging and they demonstrate validity of developing computer-based support tools for a clinical triage...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In Scandinavia, {{emergency}} department triage and patient flow processes, are under development. In Sweden, the triage development {{has resulted in}} two new triage scales, the Adaptive Process Triage and the Medical <b>Emergency</b> <b>Triage</b> and Treatment System. Both these scales have logistic components, aiming to improve patient flows. The {{aim of this study}} was to report the development and current status of {{emergency department}} triage and patient flow processes in Sweden. Methods In 2009 and 2010 the Swedish Council on Health Technology Assessment sent out a questionnaire to the ED managers in all (74) Swedish hospital emergency departments. The questionnaire comprised questions about triage and interventions to improve patient flows. Results Nearly all (97 %) EDs in Sweden employed a triage scale in 2010, which was an increase from 2009 (73 %). Further, the Medical <b>Emergency</b> <b>Triage</b> and Treatment System was the triage scale most commonly implemented across the country. The implementation of flow-related interventions was not as common, but more than half (59 %) of the EDs have implemented or plan to implement nurse requested X-ray. Conclusions There has been an increase in the use of triage scales in Swedish EDs during the last few years, with acceleration for the past two years. Most EDs have come to use the Medical <b>Emergency</b> <b>Triage</b> and Treatment System, which also indicates regional co-operation. The implementation of different interventions for improved patient flows in EDs most likely is explained by the problem of crowding. Generally, more studies are needed to investigate the economical aspects of these interventions. </p...|$|E
