A written statement by the Afghan government denied the 'systematic' nature of torture and claimed the report was exaggerated, although it admitted to deficiencies {{due to a lack}} of training and resources. The report also suggested that detainees handed over by the CF received different treatment, with one case citing a man who stated everyone was treated badly unless they were handled by Canadians.|$|E
5|$|Boeing {{initially}} {{proposed a}} purpose-built aircraft, but tests <b>indicated</b> <b>it</b> would not outperform the already-operational 707, so {{the latter was}} chosen instead. To increase endurance, this design was to be powered by eight General Electric TF34s. It would carry its radar in a rotating dome mounted {{at the top of}} a forward-swept tail, above the fuselage. Boeing was selected ahead of McDonnell Douglas's DC-8-based proposal in July 1970. Initial orders were placed for two aircraft, designated EC-137D as test beds to evaluate the two competing radars. As the test-beds did not need the same 14-hour endurance demanded of the production aircraft, the EC-137s retained the Pratt & Whitney JT3D commercial engines, and a later reduction in endurance requirement led to retaining the normal engines in production.|$|E

5|$|E. Newton {{noted that}} he had {{expected}} the male would be adorned with a red patch on the wing, but {{that the absence of}} this <b>indicated</b> <b>it</b> was immature. He still found it more beautiful than the female. These two specimens are the only preserved individuals of the species. The mandible and sternum were extracted from the female specimen, and subfossil remains have since been found in the Plaine Corail caverns on Rodrigues. The genus Palaeornis was later declared a junior synonym of Psittacula, and all species within the former were transferred to the latter. The genus name Psittacula is derived from the Latin words Psittacus, which means parrot, and -ula, which is a diminutive suffix.|$|E
5|$|Gorgosaurus is {{classified}} in the theropod subfamily Albertosaurinae within the family Tyrannosauridae. It is most {{closely related to the}} slightly younger Albertosaurus. These are the only two definite albertosaurine genera that have been described, although other undescribed species may exist. Appalachiosaurus was described as a basal tyrannosauroid just outside Tyrannosauridae, although American paleontologist Thomas Holtz published a phylogenetic analysis in 2004 which <b>indicated</b> <b>it</b> was an albertosaurine. More recent, unpublished work by Holtz agrees with the original assessment. All other tyrannosaurid genera, including Daspletosaurus, Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, are {{classified in the}} subfamily Tyrannosaurinae. Compared to the tyrannosaurines, albertosaurines had slender builds, with proportionately smaller, lower skulls and longer bones of the lower leg (tibia) and feet (metatarsals and phalanges).|$|E
5|$|Having made {{landfall}} {{in southwestern}} Florida, Dottie quickly proceeded northeastward before re-emerging into the Atlantic Ocean. High pressure {{building to the}} north of the storm <b>indicated</b> <b>it</b> would turn more towards the west, but it moved nearly due northward. The cyclone attained its peak intensity with winds of 50mph (85km/h) at 0600 UTC on August 20 and subsequently began to weaken; by the time Dottie made landfall in Charleston, South Carolina later that evening, it was barely of tropical storm intensity. It deteriorated into a tropical depression on August 21 and dissipated shortly thereafter. The remnant low pressure system turned southward and once again entered the Atlantic before turning westward and crossing the Florida peninsula.|$|E

With a lead tenant secured, construction of the identical tower commenced in July 1990. Two Commerce Square was completed in July 1992 and Conrail began moving in approximately 3,000 employees in September of that year. Two Commerce Square marked the end of the skyscraper boom of the 1980s, being the last office skyscraper to be built in Philadelphia until the Cira Centre in 2005.|$|E
5|$|In his 1986 infrageneric {{classification}} {{of the genus}} Boletus, Rolf Singer placed C.calopus as the type species of the section Calopodes, which includes species characterised by having a whitish to yellowish flesh, bitter taste, and a blue staining reaction in the tube walls. Other species in section Calopodes include C.radicans, C.inedulis, B.peckii, and B.pallidus. Genetic analysis published in 2013 showed that C.calopus and many (but not all) red-pored boletes {{were part of a}} dupainii clade (named for Boletus (now Rubroboletus)dupainii), well-removed from the core group of the type species B.edulis and relatives within the Boletineae. This <b>indicated</b> <b>it</b> needed placement in a new genus.

Irene continued to move towards the north-northeast, crossed over the western portion of the Isla de la Juventud as a strong tropical storm, and hours later, it struck mainland Cuba near Batabano. The storm was able to strengthen further over the Florida Straits, and Irene attained hurricane status on October 15. It passed over Key West, turned more to the north-northeast, and struck mainland Florida at Cape Sable as an 80mph (130km/h) hurricane.|$|E

5|$|After {{reaching}} {{tropical storm}} status, Floyd accelerated {{to the north}} in the western Caribbean Sea, due to an approaching cold front. Steadily intensifying, the storm moved over extreme western Cuba early on October12. Initially it was forecast to make landfall between Naples and Fort Myers, Florida. Unexpectedly the storm turned sharply northeastward into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. Based on reports from the Hurricane Hunters, Floyd briefly attained hurricane status on October12. Around the same time, the nearby cold front spawned a low pressure area that cut off the hurricane's inflow. While moving through the Florida Keys, Floyd became the only hurricane to affect the United States that year. However, its convection was rapidly decreasing over the center due to the front, and shortly thereafter Floyd weakened to tropical storm status. The circulation became nearly impossible to track on satellite imagery, although surface observations <b>indicated</b> <b>it</b> passed just south of Miami, Florida. The storm underwent extratropical transition as it weakened over the Bahamas, and Floyd {{was no longer a}} tropical cyclone by late on October18. The circulation dissipated within the cold front early the next day.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Bertha was {{an unusual}} {{tropical}} cyclone in early August 2014 that attained minimal hurricane status, despite having a disheveled appearance and a relatively high atmospheric pressure. On July26, a tropical wave south of the Cape Verde Islands was monitored for possible tropical cyclogenesis. Over the following days, it slowly developed and acquired gale-force winds and enough convection to be designated as Tropical Storm Bertha early on August1. A mostly disorganized cyclone, Bertha quickly moved across the Lesser Antilles, clipping {{the northern end of}} Martinique, later that day. During its trek across the eastern Caribbean Sea, its circulation became severely disrupted and it may have degenerated into a tropical wave. On August3, it traversed the Mona Passage and moved over the Southeastern Bahamas where conditions favored development. Despite an overall ragged appearance on satellite imagery, data from Hurricane Hunters <b>indicated</b> <b>it</b> intensified to a hurricane on August4; it acquired peak winds of 80mph (130km/h) that day. Turning north, and later northeast, Bertha soon weakened as it began to merge with an approaching trough to the west. This merger ultimately took place on August6, at which time Bertha was declared extratropical well to the south of Nova Scotia. The remnant system raced eastward across the Atlantic and later struck the United Kingdom on August10. Once over the North Sea, the storm stalled for a few days before resuming its eastward track. It was last noted around the Baltic Sea on August16.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the path}} of Emmy was {{uncertain}} whether it would affect the Lesser Antilles. As a result, officials issued a hurricane watch for the northeastern Leeward Islands. The warning was cancelled when the storm turned more to the north, with the outer fringes of the hurricane slightly impacting Antigua. Several ships experienced rough seas and strong winds from Emmy, though none reported any damage. After Emmy turned to the west for the final time, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center considered the hurricane not a real threat to land, though they <b>indicated</b> <b>it</b> had a remote chance to affect land masses. The hurricane also posed {{a threat to the}} island of Bermuda initially, though it remained away from the island. Two days before Emmy passed through the Azores, the National Hurricane Center advised citizens there to closely monitor the progress of the storm. No damage reports exist from the Azores, though it was likely not severe.|$|E
