The {{project is}} in two parts: A study, which investigates guaranteed service in NoC implementations and an extension of the <b>virtual</b> <b>circuit</b> support in MANGO. The study conducted in this project examines seven different NoC implementations-both academic and industrious. The main focus of the study is to investigate the different approaches to guaranteed service. The second part of this project describes the implementation of reconfigurable <b>virtual</b> <b>circuits</b> in MANGO, an asynchronous NoC developed in the PhD thesis by Tobias Bjerregaard, at IMM, DTU.

5000|$|X.25 {{supports}} {{two types}} of <b>virtual</b> <b>circuits,</b> <b>virtual</b> calls (VC) and permanent <b>virtual</b> <b>circuits</b> (PVC). <b>Virtual</b> calls are established on an as-needed basis. For example, a VC is established when a call is placed and torn down after the call is complete. VCs are established through a call establishment and clearing procedure. On the other hand, permanent <b>virtual</b> <b>circuits</b> are preconfigured into the network. [...] PVCs are seldom torn down and thus provide a dedicated connection between end points.|$|R

40|$|A message {{transport}} mechanism which provides highbandwidth low-latency interprocessor communication {{is the key}} to the ability of multicomputers to achieve high performance. The system should adapt to changing conditions by routing packets around congested areas and failed links or nodes. We introduce a new message {{transport mechanism}}, called Dynamic <b>Virtual</b> <b>Circuits,</b> that combines the best features of circuit switching, packet switching, and static <b>virtual</b> <b>circuits.</b> Routing through intermediate nodes usually requires only a single lookup in a small table, packets include minimal control information, and are delivered in FIFO order. Nodes in the middle of a Dynamic <b>Virtual</b> <b>Circuit</b> can break it and later reestablish it through a different physical path, thus supporting adaptive routing while maintaining the semantics of <b>virtual</b> <b>circuits.</b> We present the basic algorithms for Dynamic <b>Virtual</b> <b>Circuits</b> and the required hardware support in the context of a VLSI communication coprocessor for mu [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|With <b>virtual</b> <b>circuit</b> multiplexing, the {{communicating}} hosts {{agree to}} send only one packets {{belonging to a}} single high-level protocol on any given ATM <b>virtual</b> <b>circuit,</b> and multiple <b>virtual</b> <b>circuits</b> {{may need to be}} set up. It has the advantage of not requiring additional protocol-identifying information in a packet, which minimizes the overhead. For example, if the hosts agree to transfer IP, a sender can pass each datagram directly to AAL5 to transfer, nothing needs to be sent besides the datagram and the AAL5 trailer. This reduction in overhead tends to further improve efficiency (e.g., an IPv4 datagram containing a TCP ACK-only packet with neither IP nor TCP options exactly fits into a single ATM cell). The chief disadvantage of such a scheme lies in duplication of virtual circuits: a host must create a separate <b>virtual</b> <b>circuit</b> for each high-level protocol if more than one protocol is used. Because most carriers charge for each <b>virtual</b> <b>circuit,</b> customers try to avoid using multiple circuits because it adds unnecessary cost.|$|R
50|$|The network {{may allow}} the {{selection}} of the maximal length in range 16 to 4096 octets (2n values only) per <b>virtual</b> <b>circuit</b> by negotiation as part of the call setup procedure. The maximal length may be different at the two ends of the <b>virtual</b> <b>circuit.</b>|$|R
50|$|A <b>virtual</b> <b>circuit</b> (VC) is a {{means of}} {{transporting}} data over a packet switched computer network {{in such a way that}} it appears as though there is a dedicated physical layer link between the source and destination end systems of this data. The term <b>virtual</b> <b>circuit</b> is synonymous with virtual connection and virtual channel. Before a connection or <b>virtual</b> <b>circuit</b> may be used, it has to be established, between two or more nodes or software applications, by configuring the relevant parts of the interconnecting network. After that, a bit stream or byte stream may be delivered between the nodes; hence, a <b>virtual</b> <b>circuit</b> protocol allows higher level protocols to avoid dealing with the division of data into segments, packets, or frames.|$|R

50|$|ATM {{can build}} <b>virtual</b> <b>circuits</b> and <b>virtual</b> paths either statically or dynamically. Static <b>circuits</b> (permanent <b>virtual</b> <b>circuits</b> or PVCs) or paths (permanent virtual paths or PVPs) {{require that the}} circuit is {{composed}} {{of a series of}} segments, one for each pair of interfaces through which it passes.|$|R
50|$|Another {{advantage}} {{of the use of}} <b>virtual</b> <b>circuits</b> comes with the ability to use them as a multiplexing layer, allowing different services (such as voice, frame relay, n* 64 channels, IP). The VPI is useful for reducing the switching table of some <b>virtual</b> <b>circuits</b> which have common paths.|$|R

40|$|Today, large {{telecommunications}} {{customers are}} increasingly using {{virtual private network}}s to link geographically dispersed sites. A virtual private network is provided by provisioning a set of permanent (long term) <b>virtual</b> <b>circuits</b> between customer endpoints on a large backbone network. This paper considers the problem of routing a set of permanent <b>virtual</b> <b>circuit</b> requests over a backbone network. Several factors make this routing problem complicated. Routing decisions must be made on-line without any knowledge of future request sets. Furthermore, frequent rerouting to correct inefficiencies that can result from the on-line routing decisions are not possible since rerouting creates a service disruption for the customer. Finally, the forward and reverse bandwidth of a <b>virtual</b> <b>circuit</b> must be routed over the same single path.

40|$|Over {{the last}} several years, a variety of {{multipoint}} <b>virtual</b> <b>circuit</b> switching systems have been proposed for use in Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networks.

This motivates a renewed interest in networks which are nonblocking with respect to requests to create or modify multipoint <b>virtual</b> <b>circuits.</b> While the various multipoint switching system architectures can all be configured to achieve nonblocking operation, for most, the cost of the nonblocking configuration quickly becomes prohibitive.
