5|$|At {{present the}} most {{informative}} sequence of dinosaur-bearing {{rocks in the}} world from the K–Pg boundary is found in western North America, particularly the late Maastrichtian-age Hell Creek Formation of Montana. This formation, when compared with the older (approximately 75Ma) Judith River/Dinosaur Park Formations (<b>from</b> <b>Montana</b> and Alberta respectively) provides information on the changes in dinosaur populations over the last 10million years of the Cretaceous. These fossil beds are geographically limited, covering only part of one continent.|$|E

5|$|Several tyrannosaurid skeletons {{from the}} Two Medicine Formation and Judith River Formation of Montana {{probably}} belong to Gorgosaurus, although it remains uncertain whether {{they belong to}} G. libratus or a new species. One specimen <b>from</b> <b>Montana</b> (TCMI 2001.89.1), housed in the Children's Museum of Indianapolis, shows evidence of severe pathologies, including healed leg, rib, and vertebral fractures, osteomyelitis (infection) {{at the tip of}} the lower jaw resulting in permanent tooth loss, and possibly a brain tumor.|$|E

5|$|The name Deinodontidae {{was coined}} by Edward Drinker Cope in 1866 for this family, and {{continued}} {{to be used in}} place of the newer name Tyrannosauridae through the 1960s. The type genus of the Deinodontidae is Deinodon, which was named after isolated teeth <b>from</b> <b>Montana.</b> However, in a 1970 review of North American tyrannosaurs, Dale Russell concluded that Deinodon was not a valid taxon, and used the name Tyrannosauridae in place of Deinodontidae, stating that this was in accordance with ICZN rules. Therefore, Tyrannosauridae is preferred by modern experts.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} of {{counties}} in Wyoming. There are 23 {{counties in}} the U.S. state of Wyoming. There were originally five counties in the Wyoming Territory: Laramie and Carter, established in 1867; Carbon and Albany established in 1868; and Uinta, an annexed portion of Utah and Idaho, extending <b>from</b> <b>Montana</b> (including Yellowstone Park) to the Wyoming-Utah boundary. On July 10, 1890, Wyoming was admitted to the Union with thirteen counties in it. Ten more counties were created after statehood.|$|E

5|$|A {{skeleton}} of the hadrosaurid Edmontosaurus annectens {{has been described}} <b>from</b> <b>Montana</b> with healed tyrannosaur-inflicted damage on its tail vertebrae. The fact that the damage seems to have healed suggests that the Edmontosaurus survived a tyrannosaur's attack on a living target, i.e. the tyrannosaur had attempted active predation. There is also evidence for an aggressive interaction between a Triceratops and a Tyrannosaurus {{in the form of}} partially healed tyrannosaur tooth marks on a Triceratops brow horn and squamosal (a bone of the neck frill); the bitten horn is also broken, with new bone growth after the break. It is not known what the exact nature of the interaction was, though: either animal could have been the aggressor. Since the Triceratops wounds healed, it is most likely that the Triceratops survived the encounter and managed to overcome the Tyrannosaurus. Paleontologist Peter Dodson estimates that in a battle against a bull Triceratops, the Triceratops had the upper hand and would successfully defend itself by inflicting fatal wounds to the Tyrannosaurus using its sharp horns.|$|E
5|$|He was {{diagnosed}} with paranoid schizophrenia six years before the shooting and spent fifty-three days in a mental hospital after threatening a Montana resident. He was released after testing as being of no danger to himself or anyone else. Eighteen months before the shooting, he moved back to Valmeyer <b>from</b> <b>Montana.</b> Once home, {{he was known to}} compulsively hack at trees which filled his back yard following the Mississippi River floods of 1993. There was so much downed timber on his family's homestead that they had to ask him to stop cutting at trees. Two days prior to the Capitol shooting, at his grandmother's insistence to do something about nearby cats which were becoming a nuisance, Weston shot and killed 14 cats with a single-barreled shotgun, leaving several in a bucket and burying the rest.|$|E
5|$|In 1856, Joseph Leidy {{described}} two tyrannosaurid premaxillary teeth <b>from</b> <b>Montana.</b> Although {{there was}} no indication of what the animal looked like, the teeth were large and robust, and Leidy gave them the name Deinodon. Matthew and Brown commented in 1922 that these teeth were indistinguishable from those of Gorgosaurus, but in the absence of skeletal remains of Deinodon, opted not to unequivocally synonymize the two genera, provisionally naming a ?Deinodon libratus. Although Deinodon teeth are very similar to those of Gorgosaurus, tyrannosaurid teeth are extremely uniform, so it cannot be said for certain which animal they belonged to. Deinodon is usually regarded as a nomen dubium today. Additional likely synonyms of G. libratus and/or D. horridus include Laelaps falculus, Laelaps hazenianus, Laelaps incrassatus, and Dryptosaurus kenabekides.|$|E

5|$|South Dakota is {{situated}} in the north-central United States, and {{is considered to be}} a part of the Midwest by the U.S. Census Bureau, although the Great Plains region also covers the state. Additionally, the culture, economy, and geography of western South Dakota has more in common with the West than the Midwest. The state has a total land area of 77,116sq.miles (199,905km2), making it the 17th largest in the Union. South Dakota is bordered to the north by North Dakota; to the south by Nebraska; to the east by Iowa and Minnesota; and to the west by Wyoming and Montana. The western border is the Black Hills meridian, a north-south line set out at a certain distance from Washington, D.C., to separate South Dakota <b>from</b> <b>Montana</b> and Wyoming during the transition to statehood.|$|E
5|$|Another study corroborated {{the latter}} study's results but found {{the growth rate}} to be much faster, finding it to be around 1800 {{kilograms}} (4000lbs). Although these results were much higher than previous estimations, the authors noted that these results significantly lowered the great difference between its actual growth rate and the one which would be expected of an animal of its size. The sudden change in growth rate {{at the end of}} the growth spurt may indicate physical maturity, a hypothesis which is supported by the discovery of medullary tissue in the femur of a 16 to 20-year-old Tyrannosaurus rex <b>from</b> <b>Montana</b> (MOR 1125, also known as B-rex). Medullary tissue is found only in female birds during ovulation, indicating that B-rex was of reproductive age. Further study indicates an age of 18 for this specimen. In 2016, it was finally confirmed by Mary Higby Schweitzer and Lindsay Zanno et al that the soft tissue within the femur of MOR 1125 was medullary tissue. This also confirmed the identity of the specimen as a female. The discovery of medullary bone tissue within Tyrannosaurus may prove valuable in determining the sex of other dinosaur species in future examinations, as the chemical makeup of medullary tissue is unmistakable. Other tyrannosaurids exhibit extremely similar growth curves, although with lower growth rates corresponding to their lower adult sizes.|$|E

25|$|In {{the fourth}} quarter, Houston {{defensive}} back Terry Hoage intercepted a pass <b>from</b> <b>Montana</b> at the Chiefs 25-yard line, setting up Del Greco's 43-yard field goal {{to make the}} score 13–7. But Kansas City quickly stormed back to take their first lead of the game, scoring in just three plays: a 22-yard completion <b>from</b> <b>Montana</b> to Cash, a 38-yard pass interference penalty against Houston, and Montana's 11-yard touchdown pass to Birden. Then on the first play of Houston's ensuing drive, Thomas forced a fumble from Moon that defensive lineman Dan Saleaumua recovered on the Oilers 13-yard line, setting up Montana's 18-yard touchdown pass to Davis. Moon then led the Oilers 80 yards with eight consecutive completions, including a 23-yard catch by Jeffires, to score on wide receiver Ernest Givins' 7-yard touchdown reception, making the score 21–20 with 3:35 left. But the Chiefs responded with a critical 41-yard completion <b>from</b> <b>Montana</b> to Cash on third and 1, setting up Marcus Allen's game clinching 21-yard touchdown run.|$|E
