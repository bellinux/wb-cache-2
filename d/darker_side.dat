40|$|A {{large number}} of {{empirical}} studies have illustrated the benefits of adopting and implementing a relational or relationship marketing strategy. However, there is an emergent stream of literature that suggests that despite the recognized benefits associated with this strategy {{there may also be}} a <b>dark</b> <b>side</b> that manifests itself between firms as a result of adopting a relationship marketing strategy. However, though this stream of literature recognizes the presence of the <b>dark</b> <b>side,</b> causal antecedents mediating the <b>dark</b> <b>side</b> constructs, or consequences of the <b>dark</b> <b>side</b> have yet to be theoretically derived, explained or empirically tested. This dissertation constructs theoretical relationships between common relational constructs, such as trust and commitment and <b>dark</b> <b>side</b> symptoms such as relational myopia, complacency, vulnerability and suspicion. This dissertation also examines how these <b>dark</b> <b>side</b> symptoms, upon their onset, can yield negative consequences for the firms that have adopted the relationship marketing strategy. Data from a diverse set of business to business (B 2 B) relationships (N= 305) was gathered to test the structural model implicit in the theoretical propositions presented in this dissertation. The results support the hypothesized notion of a <b>dark</b> <b>side</b> to B 2 B relationships as the relational constructs of shared values, commitment, trust, and satisfaction were all found to have a positive, significant relationship with elements of the <b>dark</b> <b>side.</b> These results are discussed in detail within the chapters of this dissertation...|$|R
