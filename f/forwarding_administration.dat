5000|$|In 1996, MULO {{agreed to}} switch from the two-year {{contract}} format to a four-year contract format. This created difficulty in maintaining a leadership {{and the ability to}} engage members. Combined with this was an economic boom in Madison which created a significant labor shortage due to a massive drop [...] and forced the minimum wage of The Wisconsin Union to rise dramatically. The demand for workers created many opportunities for student-workers in the City, which further hurt the ability of the labor union to attract members or leaders. Other internal issues created continuity problems and, in 2004, MULO was shut down by the university administration. The administration, reportedly, demanded that MULO present elected officials with which to negotiate. When none came <b>forward,</b> the <b>administration</b> moved to ignore the labor union. MULO has never had a decertification vote.|$|R

For example, his [...] "100-day plan" [...] to accelerate the rebuilding of New Orleans was bashed for what critics said was a tardy release, lack of details and activity in moving <b>forward.</b> [...] Nagin <b>administration</b> spokesperson Rob Couhig backed away from a 100-day promise, stating {{that it was not}} meant as a [...] "time period," [...] but as a short-range initiative to improve quality-of-life issues. Delays in FEMA reimbursements and federal recovery dollars reaching the city caused many significant delays.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Today, {{the working}} areas put <b>forward</b> the <b>administration</b> of change. In {{order to provide}} this; it is {{required}} from the organizations to be creative. Professional creativity in offices depends on an environment that enables {{the development of the}} organization only after the individual or collective exertions within the organization. By providing this environment, the organization will gain efficiency, productivity, and work pleasure. In order to bring up the workforce appropriate to the related expectations, the professional creativity of the office management and secretarial profession candidates should be evaluated, education programs appropriate to this and related directly with the service quality should be prepared and the future of this profession should be directed. The aim {{of this study is to}} ensure the attention to improve the prepared education program as well as the creative thoughts and their applications, when carrying out an office management and secretarial training. 144 students took place in this research and a questionnaire of 48 questions was carried out.

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "In January 2007, the President announced a new U. S. strategy to stem the violence in Iraq and help the Iraqi government foster conditions for national reconciliation. In The New Way <b>Forward,</b> the <b>Administration</b> articulated near-term goals to achieve over a 12 - to 18 -month period and reasserted the end state for Iraq: a unified, democratic, federal Iraq that can govern, defend, and sustain itself and is an ally {{in the war on}} terror. To support this strategy, the United States increased its military presence and financial commitments for Iraq operations. This testimony discusses (1) progress in meeting key security, legislative, and economic goals of The New Way Forward; and (2) past and current U. S. strategies for Iraq and the need for an updated strategy. GAO reviewed documents and interviewed officials from U. S. agencies, MNF-I, the UN, and the Iraqi government. GAO also had staff stationed in Baghdad. Since 2003, GAO has issued about 140 Iraq-related products, which provided baseline information for this assessment. ...|$|R
5000|$|Church's {{environmental}} legislation culminated in 1980 {{with the passage}} of the Central Idaho Wilderness Act. The act created the River of No Return Wilderness by combining the Idaho Primitive Area, the Salmon River Breaks Primitive Area, and a portion of the Magruder Corridor. [...] The Act also added 125 mi of the Salmon River to the Wild and Scenic Rivers System. President Carter had taken his family on a three-day float trip down the Middle Fork of the Salmon River in August 1978, accompanied by Interior Secretary Cecil Andrus, the former (and future) Idaho governor. The <b>administration</b> <b>forwarded</b> a central Idaho wilderness proposal to Congress later that year and Carter signed the final act on July 23, 1980.|$|R
60|$|March 20.--I thought I {{was done}} with politics, but it is easy getting into the mess, and {{difficult}} and sometimes disgraceful to get out. I have a letter from Sheriff Oliver, desiring me to go [to Jedburgh] on Monday (to-morrow) and show countenance by adhering {{to a set of}} propositions, being a resolution. Though not well drawn, they are uncompromising enough; so I will not part company. Had a letter, too, from Henry Scott. He still expects to refuse the Bill. I wrote him that would but postpone the evil day, unless they could bring <b>forward</b> a strong <b>Administration,</b> and, what is most essential, a system of finance; otherwise it won't do. Henry has also applied to me for the rejected address. But this I shall decline.|$|R
40|$|Many {{states and}} {{communities}} are rewriting their eyewitness identification policies. Some of these jurisdictions are excluding simultaneous lineups altogether, {{and others are}} allowing them if double-blind administration of sequential lineups is not possible. The Innocence Project advocates the latter and puts <b>forward</b> blind sequential-lineup <b>administration</b> as the best form of lineup identification. Although sequential lineups are claimed to be superior, no explicit policy analysis has been done. In the present study, the author uses a policy-analysis model based on decision theory to examine the utility of simultaneous and sequential lineups, {{as well as to}} examine a range of values placed on identification outcomes and their probabilities. Simultaneous lineups are shown to be superior to sequential lineups under most conditions examined in this analysis...|$|R
50|$|Apart from pharmaceuticals, {{peptides}} {{are also}} used for diagnostics and vaccines. The total production volume (excl. Aspartame) of chemically synthesized, pure peptides is about 1500 kilograms and sales approach $500 million on the active pharmaceutical (API) level and $10 billion on the finished drug level, respectively. The bulk of the production of peptide drugs, which comprise also the first generation anti-AIDS drugs, the “…navirs”, is outsourced to a few specialized contract manufacturers, such as Bachem, Switzerland; Chengu GT Biochem, China; Chinese Peptide Company, China; Lonza, Switzerland, and Polypeptide, Denmark. Proteins are “very high-molecular-weight” (MW > 100,000) organic compounds, consisting of amino acid sequences linked by peptide bonds. They {{are essential to the}} structure and function of all living cells and viruses and are among the most actively studied molecules in biochemistry. They can be made only by advanced biotechnological processes; primarily mammalian cell cultures. Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) prevail among human-made proteins. About a dozen of them are approved as pharmaceuticals. Important modern products are EPO (Binocrit, NeoRecormon, erythropoietin), Enbrel (etanercerpt), Remicade (infliximab); MabThera/Rituxin (rituximab), and Herceptin (trastuzumab).PEGylation is a big step <b>forward</b> regarding <b>administration</b> of peptide and protein drugs. The method offers the two-fold advantage of substituting injection by oral administration and reducing the dosage, and therefore the cost of the treatment. The pioneer company in this field is Prolong Pharmaceuticals which has developed a PEGylated erythropoietin (PEG-EPO).|$|R
40|$|Purpose – To {{explore the}} {{assumptions}} underlying the traditional “principles of administration” {{in the light}} of the rise of interest in corporate social responsibility, business ethics and corporate governance and to link revised principles to practical stakeholder models, using, for example, modern communications media. Design/methodology/approach – Using concepts of “fit” between traditional administrative principles and common problems of business administration, such as those identified in the corporate social responsibility, business ethics and corporate governance literature, the approach is to locate principles on which sound administration and “proper” expectations of stakeholders can be adjusted acceptably. Findings – Traditional lists of principles can be fruitfully replaced by methods for identifying and meeting the aspirations of stakeholders, within agreed principles, which may vary, depending on the level of generality and on circumstances. Research limitations/implications – The paper is based on observation and conceptual analysis. Developments appear to depend on willingness to replace codes and practices that are devised from the top and imposed on others by ones that are responsive to stakeholders. Practical implications – Responsive codes imply a need to respond in a principled way to differing aspirations, and a willingness to use modern digital media to identify the aspirations accurately. Originality/value – Traditional principles of administration are essentially principles for administering the internal labour market in large organisations. The proposed approach broadens the range of application and offers practical ways <b>forward.</b> Business <b>administration,</b> Corporate social responsibility, Stakeholder analysis...|$|R
40|$|It is the {{strategic}} objective of maritime nations {{to develop and}} sustain an indigenous merchant marine {{to be able to}} participate in cargo lifting in the international seaborne shipping trade and thus earn shipping freight revenues. Various policies aimed at achieving this objective have been put <b>forward</b> by Maritime <b>Administration</b> of nations and indeed the Nigerian Maritime Administration. Successful implementation and appraisal of these policies arguably depend on quantitative estimation of shipping tonnage demand and other freight market indices. This paper attempts an exploratory analysis of shipping tonnage demand in the Nigeria’s non-oil freight market. Based on shipment level data obtained from port terminals records, we conduct a parametric analysis to determine demand for shipping tonnage and shipping routes showing intense transport demand. Trend analysis of aggregated trade volumes is conducted to examine the viability of Nigeria’s seaborne trade in the short term. Policy framework aimed at development of indigenous shipping tonnage capacity, trade facilitation and sustenance is proposed...|$|R
40|$|Management {{of digital}} {{identity}} involves every company and institution, {{not only in}} the internet world. Among different identity management models, only the federated one is able to ensure a strong protection in terms of trust and privacy. In fact, the participants in the federation decide to trust each other about which information can be exchanged in the processes of authentication and authorisation, based on established policies to manage relationships of trust. According to this, it has been widely adopted during the last years. In particular, its adoption in Public Administration allows a proper organisation autonomy, supporting access to the services offered by the institution. This process is going to quickly raise with the progressive adoption of cloud computing by Public Administrations. In the paper, two projects accomplishing federated digital identity in Italian Public Administrations are presented. Starting from lessons learned, authors highlight a path <b>forward</b> for Public <b>Administration</b> toward federated digital identity in cloud computing scenario...|$|R

50|$|Governments {{have always}} been called upon to face {{difficult}} problems. Setting priorities and making choices {{have always been}} difficult. For example, eliminating a sizable deficit is “merely” a difficult problem, although {{it is hard to}} believe when one is in the middle of such a heart-wrenching exercise. This entails making choices among equally deserving public purposes and making tough decisions about what should be preserved for the future. It requires reconciling future needs with what could garner a sufficient degree of public support in the short term to move <b>forward.</b> Academic public <b>administration</b> has lagged considerably behind practicing public administration. Improved curricula and a refocusing of emphasis upon the policy dynamics of government administration will be important factors in enticing more students to study of public administration. It is more important to increase the number and improving the geographic spread of universities with public affairs programs, integrating public affairs components into the curricula of other graduate and professional programs, developing many more in-service, mid-career educational programs for public servants, and utilizing existing resources to strengthen public affairs programs.|$|R
40|$|As I {{am writing}} this editorial, the U. S. has just elected a new president. In a recent Newsweek article, Sharon Begley (2008) {{discusses}} how {{a climate of}} distrust of science has prevailed under the Bush administration. Global warming, stem cell programs, and even evaluations of sex education programs have all been under attack by an administration seemingly more interested in discrediting science to support its political agendas rather than in presenting more appropriate economic or moral arguments. Begley asserts that the negative attitude toward science and “inconvenient facts ” will take {{a great deal of}} work to undo. Compounding the problem, the Department of Education has severely limited acceptable program evaluations to those with experimental and quasi-experimental designs, approaches that are often poorly suited to understanding complex social interactions, like teaching and learning science. I am looking <b>forward</b> to an <b>administration</b> that will value scholarship and bring more credibility to science and science education research. I imagine most science education researchers (regardless of partisan affiliations) are feeling the same way. The work of science education researchers has never been more important, for both the U. S. and the world. Schools in the U. S. must begin to recover from an over-emphasis on high-stakes testing and the resulting reductionist pressure on curriculum. With renewed attention and energy will come renewed opportunities to implement improved instructional practices and professional development. Throughout the world, people face increasingly complex environmental, economic, and political challenges requiring thoughtful action by leaders and societies that understand and value scientific inquiry and data-driven decisions. All of these offer opportunities for science educators to better understand how school science can prepare us for the future. The articles in this issue represent a range, depth, and quality of science education research needed to take back a respect for science. They all explore way...|$|R
