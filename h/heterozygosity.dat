5|$|A third form of progeny {{arises when}} F1 hybrids are bred with animals genetically {{dissimilar}} to their parents. If <b>heterozygosity</b> is maintained or increased as a result, hybrid vigour and other production benefits {{occurring in the}} F1 generation will be maintained or increased. Maintenance of <b>heterozygosity</b> {{is the key to}} maintaining the highest levels of hybrid vigour. This requires complex breeding programmes and high levels of management. Simplified crossbreeding programmes have been developed using hybrid or composite bulls, which was the motivation behind the development of Lim-Flex hybrids.|$|E
5|$|Females who {{participate}} in extra-pair fertilizations may incorporate better genes in their offspring than they could get with their social mate, but {{they are likely to}} receive less help with parental care from their social mates because of cheating. Extra-pair fertilization, therefore, can be costly to females as well. A possible theory why extra-pair fertilization occurs is that female organisms select males with overall high <b>heterozygosity</b> or dissimilar genetics from themselves. A microsatellite study suggests an alternative to <b>heterozygosity</b> selection. Because no correlation is found between female extra-pair fertilization frequencies and the overall <b>heterozygosity</b> of their social mates, it is suggested that females may choose only a selective set of heterozygous genes, particularly the MHC locus, which can affect the immunocompetence of offspring.|$|E
5|$|Virtual {{karyotyping}} can {{be performed}} on fresh or paraffin-embedded tumors to assess copy number at these loci. SNP array virtual karyotyping is preferred for tumor samples, including neuroblastomas, because they can detect copy neutral loss of <b>heterozygosity</b> (acquired uniparental disomy). Copy neutral LOH can be biologically equivalent to a deletion and has been detected at key loci in neuroblastoma. ArrayCGH, FISH, or conventional cytogenetics cannot detect copy neutral LOH.|$|E

To reveal the population genetic structure of C. trifascialis across its Indo-Pacific range, primers for thirteen independent microsatellite loci were developed. Observed <b>heterozygosities</b> ranged from 0. 174 to 1 and expected <b>heterozygosities</b> ranged from 0. 043 to 0. 920 in 20 individuals from one Northern Great Barrier Reef location. Primers for 16 independent loci were also developed for the related butterflyfish Chaetodon lunlulatus to enable comparative studies of population genetic structure. These loci had observed <b>heterozygosities</b> ranging from 0. 476 to 0. 952 and expected <b>heterozygosities</b> ranging from 0. 484 to 0. 933.

5|$|A {{number of}} genetically {{discrete}} subpopulations {{have been identified}} across the northern range of the Pacific angelshark. Several subpopulations exist along the coast from Point Conception northward to Alaska. In the Southern California Bight, {{there are at least}} three separate subpopulations off the mainland and northern and southern Channel Islands. The subpopulation along the Pacific coast of Baja California are distinct from those in the Gulf of California. These subpopulations have diverged from one another over time because Pacific angelsharks do not undertake long migratory movements outside of their preferred home areas, and deep waters serve as effective geographical barriers to population mixing. <b>Heterozygosity,</b> a measure of genetic diversity, is higher in the Pacific angelshark than in other shark species that have been examined.|$|E
5|$|Genes {{related to}} FLCN and {{diseases}} similar to BHD {{have been found}} in dogs, fruit flies, rats, and mice. In German Shepherd dogs, missense mutations in the canine ortholog of FLCN cause a similar phenotype to human BHD—kidney cancers (in this case, mutifocal renal cystadenocarcinoma) and skin tumors (nodular dermatofibrosis). They had a similar pattern of tumorigenesis to human BHD in that the skin lesions were heterozygous for the FLCN mutation and the renal tumors were likely caused by loss of <b>heterozygosity.</b> Female German shepherds with a FLCN mutation are also prone to uterine leiomyomas.|$|E
5|$|People with Birt–Hogg–Dubé {{syndrome}} {{are born}} with one mutated copy of the FLCN gene in each cell. Haploinsufficiency—only having one functional copy of the FLCN gene—is enough to cause the fibrofolliculomas and pulmonary cysts, however, one copy of the gene is enough to keep kidney cells in check. During their lifetime, random mutations might inactivate the normal copy of the gene in a subset of cells. When this occurs, {{the result is that}} these cells have no functional copies of the FLCN gene, allowing the cells grow out of control. This loss of <b>heterozygosity</b> is a common mechanism in cancer, and it is frequently detected in the renal cancers associated with BHD. The molecular genetic defects in renal tumors of people with BHD are different from two other similar kidney tumors, chromophobe renal cell carcinoma and renal oncocytoma. BHD-associated tumorigenesis differs between the kidney, where loss of FLCN <b>heterozygosity</b> is responsible for cancers, and the skin, where FLCN is strongly expressed in heterozygotes. FLCN {{has been found to be}} overexpressed in fibrofolliculoma tissue and to have very low levels of expression in affected kidneys.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of eight microsatellite loci in 213 animals {{was performed to}} define the genetic structure and variability of 11 East Asian native dog populations. Allele diversity, observed <b>heterozygosities,</b> expected <b>heterozygosities,</b> F-statistics, GST estimates, number of migrants per generation (Nm), and Nei’s DA distance were calculated. Expected mean <b>heterozygosities</b> of Asian native dogs varied within a range of 0. 310 – 0. 718 with a mean value of 0. 580.

5|$|Hybrids are {{offspring}} {{resulting from}} the breeding of two genetically distinct individuals, which usually {{will result in a}} high degree of <b>heterozygosity,</b> though hybrid and heterozygous are not synonymous. The deliberate or accidental hybridizing of two or more species of closely related animals through captive breeding is a human activity which has been in existence for millennia and has grown for economic purposes. Hybrids between different subspecies within a species (such as between the Bengal tiger and Siberian tiger) are known as intra-specific hybrids. Hybrids between different species within the same genus (such as between lions and tigers) are known as interspecific hybrids or crosses. Hybrids between different genera (such as between sheep and goats) are known as intergeneric hybrids. Natural hybrids will occur in hybrid zones, where two populations of species within the same genera or species living in the same or adjacent areas will interbreed with each other. Some hybrids have been recognized as species, such as the red wolf (though this is controversial).|$|E
5|$|The middle {{decades of}} the 20th century saw the rise of {{molecular}} biology, and with it {{an understanding of the}} chemical nature of genes as sequences of DNA and of their relationship—through the genetic code—to protein sequences. At the same time, increasingly powerful techniques for analyzing proteins, such as protein electrophoresis and sequencing, brought biochemical phenomena into realm of the synthetic theory of evolution. In the early 1960s, biochemists Linus Pauling and Emile Zuckerkandl proposed the molecular clock hypothesis (MCH): that sequence differences between homologous proteins could be used to calculate the time since two species diverged. By 1969, Motoo Kimura and others provided a theoretical basis for the molecular clock, arguing that—at the molecular level at least—most genetic mutations are neither harmful nor helpful and that mutation and genetic drift (rather than natural selection) cause a large portion of genetic change: the neutral theory of molecular evolution. Studies of protein differences within species also brought molecular data to bear on population genetics by providing estimates of the level of <b>heterozygosity</b> in natural populations.|$|E

Ten microsatellite loci used in this study are appropriate for assessing the genetic diversity for this breed. Measures of genetic diversity were estimated based on allelic and genotypic calculations, observed (HO) and expected (HE) <b>heterozygosities,</b> deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and polymorphism information content (PIC). The lowest genetic diversity was estimated for locus PEZ 20, and the highest for PEZ 6 locus. Observed and expected mean <b>heterozygosities</b> were 0. 7261 and 0. 7392, respectively. Statistically significant deviation (p 0. 5) in terms of their suitability for genetic diversity studies. When all observed parameters are taken into account (observed and expected <b>heterozygosities,</b> PIC, number of detective and effective alleles, number of detected and maximum possible genotypes, major allele frequency and major allele frequency index), we can conclude that PEZ 6 locus shows the highest genetic diversity while PEZ 3 displays the lowest. However, assuming values of observed and expected <b>heterozygosities,</b> as well as PIC, we consider loci PEZ 20 to be the least diverse, but this locus has more effective alleles and more genotypes present than PEZ 3.
