5|$|Shortly after this, Lutosławski {{started work}} on his Second Symphony, which had two premieres: Pierre Boulez {{conducted}} the second movement, Direct, in 1966, and when the first movement, Hésitant, was finished in 1967, the composer conducted a complete performance in Katowice. The Second Symphony {{is very different from}} a conventional classical symphony in structure, but Lutosławski used all of his technical innovations up to that point to build a large-scale, dramatic work worthy of the name. In 1968, the work earned Lutosławski first prize from the International Music Council's International Rostrum of Composers, his third such award, which confirmed <b>his</b> <b>growing</b> international reputation.

5|$|Sienkiewicz used <b>his</b> <b>growing</b> {{international}} fame {{to influence}} world opinion {{in favor of}} the Polish cause (throughout his life and since the late 18th century, Poland remained partitioned by her neighbors, Russia, Austria and Prussia, later Germany).

More cautiously, he called on Russia's government to introduce reforms in Russian-controlled Congress Poland. During the Revolution in the Kingdom of Poland, he advocated broader Polish autonomy within the Russian Empire.|$|E
