5|$|Since 1996, McGill, in {{accordance}} with the Quebec Ministry of Education, Recreation and Sports (Ministère de l'Éducation, du Loisir et du Sport or MELS), has had eight categories that qualifies certain international students to be excused from paying international fees. These categories include: students from France, a quota of students from select countries which have agreements with MELS, which include Algeria, China, and Morocco, students holding <b>diplomatic</b> <b>status,</b> including their dependents, and students enrolled in certain language programs leading to a degree in French.|$|E
5|$|Tributary {{missions}} from vassal {{states were}} commonly allowed to include traders, who thus gained opportunities {{to do business}} in the capital markets. No doubt a large proportion of what the Chinese court chose to call tributary missions were in fact shrewdly organized commercial ventures by foreign merchants with no <b>diplomatic</b> <b>status</b> at all. This was unquestionably the case, most notably, with a group of traders who appeared on the south coast in 166 AD claiming to be envoys from the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius Antoninus.|$|E
5|$|After the German {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union in June 1941, the occupying authority in Norway started cracking down harder on opposition. A strike over milk rations in September led to the arrest and execution of the two labour leaders Viggo Hansteen and Rolf Wickstrøm. This was followed by several high-profile arrests – among them Einar Gerhardsen – and Lie had to flee the country. He left his house only hours before the Germans appeared to arrest him. From Sweden {{he made his way}} to the United Kingdom, where he worked as a propaganda secretary for the exiled Norwegian labour movement in London. He made two visits to the United States to gather support and financial aid, the first time he went from New York City to Seattle where he held a series of lectures and radio-interviews before he travelled through Canada from the west- to the east coast. The second trip was as a labour attaché with <b>diplomatic</b> <b>status.</b> While Haakon was in exile, his brother Per, who was also a labour activist, was arrested in Norway in 1942. He was imprisoned and eventually sent to Dachau, where he died from typhoid fever in March 1945.|$|E
50|$|Form I-539 {{can always}} be {{submitted}} by paper. The form is available for download from the USCIS website. The filing address depends {{on the type of}} status change or extension that the applicant is requesting. The possible filing addresses include lockbox facilities, service centers, and (in the case of <b>diplomatic</b> <b>statuses)</b> appropriate international bodies.|$|R
50|$|In a {{high-profile}} 2015 case, Deepan Budlakoti, a stateless man born in Ottawa, Ontario, was {{declared not to}} be a Canadian citizen because his parents were employed as domestic staffs by the High Commissioner of India in Canada and their contracts, which came with recognized <b>diplomatic</b> <b>statuses,</b> legally ended two months after his birth, {{despite the fact that they}} started to work for a non-diplomat well before their contracts ended and before Budlakoti was born.|$|R

25|$|In April 1983, ASIO {{uncovered}} more Soviet {{attempts at}} espionage and Valery Ivanov, who also held {{the post of}} First Secretary at the Soviet Embassy, was declared persona non grata.

50|$|Present-day Colombia and Ecuador trace back {{established}} official diplomatic relations to December, 1831 with {{the signing of}} the Treaty of Pasto, in which both countries recognized each other as sovereign states. The Ecuadorian diplomatic mission in New Granada (Colombia) did not open until 1837. It wasn't until 1939 that Ecuador raised the <b>diplomatic</b> mission's <b>status</b> to an official Embassy. Colombia did the same the following year in 1940.|$|R
50|$|After the Spanish Civil War (1936-39), Carmelo Soria, who was {{a member}} of the Communist Party of Spain (PCE), exiled himself to Chile, where he {{obtained}} double citizenship. He became a UN civil servant in the 1960s. Between 1971 and 1973, during Salvador Allendes rule, Soria temporarily abandoned his functions to become an advisor to the Popular Unity government. In September 1973, after Augusto Pinochets coup, he re-joined the UN. He then used his <b>diplomatic</b> immunity <b>status</b> to protect opponents of Pinochet by granting them political asylum in various embassies, thus making him a target for the DINA secret police.|$|R
25|$|A further {{entanglement}} {{consists in}} liturgical honours accorded to French consular officials under Capitations with the Ottoman Empire which persist {{for example in}} the Lebanon and in ownership of the Catholic cathedral in Smyrna (Izmir) and the extraterritoriality of St. Anne's in Jerusalem and more generally the <b>diplomatic</b> <b>status</b> of the Holy Places.|$|E
25|$|The United States, {{like all}} other Western nations, refused to {{recognise}} Rhodesia, but unlike others allowed its Consulate-General {{to function as a}} communications conduit between the American government in Washington, D.C., and the Rhodesian government in Salisbury. When Rhodesia set up an information office in Washington, D.C., OAS nations loudly protested. The US government responded by saying the Rhodesian mission and its staff had no official <b>diplomatic</b> <b>status</b> and violated no US laws.|$|E
25|$|Italian Renaissance {{painting}} is {{the painting of}} the period {{beginning in the late}} 13th century and flourishing from the early 15th to late 16th centuries, occurring in the Italian peninsula, which was at that time divided into many political areas. The painters of Renaissance Italy, although often attached to particular courts and with loyalties to particular towns, nonetheless wandered the length and breadth of Italy, often occupying a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>status</b> and disseminating artistic and philosophical ideas.|$|E
25|$|Global Affairs Canada (GAC; , or AMC) is the {{department}} in the Government of Canada that manages Canada's diplomatic and consular relations, to encourage the country's international trade, and to lead Canada's international development and humanitarian assistance.

50|$|In 2007, for example, the Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dermot Ahern, {{confirmed}} that Ireland recognised the Government of the People's Republic of China {{as the sole}} legitimate government of China, and that while the Taipei Representative Office in Dublin had a representative function in relation to economic and cultural promotion, it had no <b>diplomatic</b> or political <b>status.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On 30 October 2014, Wallström {{became the}} first EU foreign {{minister}} to recognise the State of Palestine, {{with a view to}} [...] "facilitate a peace agreement by making the parties less unequal", resulting in that Israel the very same day recalled its ambassador for consultations. Although a visit by Wallström to Israel had been planned for January 2015, Israel's foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman and prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu declined to receive her. Wallström's <b>diplomatic</b> immunity <b>status</b> in Israel was also revoked which meant that if she visited Israel she would do as an individual rather than an official of a foreign state, which would normally mean enjoying protection by security services.|$|R
25|$|The Labour {{government}} was {{negotiating with the}} Soviet government over intended commercial treaties -- 'the Russian Treaties' -- to provide most favoured nation privileges and <b>diplomatic</b> <b>status</b> for the UK trade delegation; and a treaty that would settle the claims of pre-revolutionary British bondholders and holders of confiscated property, after which the British government would guarantee a loan to the Soviet Union. Baldwin decided {{to vote against the}} government over the Russian Treaties, which brought the government down on 8 October.|$|E
25|$|By year 1011, Rajah Sri Bata Shaja, {{the monarch}} of the Indianized Rajahnate of Butuan, a maritime-state {{famous for its}} goldwork sent a trade envoy under {{ambassador}} Likan-shieh to the Chinese Imperial Court demanding equal <b>diplomatic</b> <b>status</b> with other states. The request being approved, it opened up direct commercial links with the Rajahnate of Butuan and the Chinese Empire thereby diminishing the monopoly on Chinese trade previously enjoyed by their rivals, Tondo and the Champa civilization. Evidence {{of the existence of}} this rajahnate is given by the Butuan Silver Paleograph.|$|E
25|$|During 1965, the {{government}} of Rhodesia made moves to establish a mission in Lisbon separate from the British Embassy, with its own accredited representative, having previously been able to establish its own consulate in Lourenço Marques, capital of Portuguese Mozambique. This prompted protests from the British government, which was determined that the representative, Harry Reedman, should be a nominal member of the British Ambassador's staff. For their part, the Portuguese authorities sought a compromise whereby they would accept Reedman as an independent representative but deny him <b>diplomatic</b> <b>status.</b>|$|E
50|$|For example, the American Institute in Taiwan {{functions}} as the United States de facto embassy {{with the chairman}} and staff acting as unofficial government consulate officers who nevertheless perform duties that official embassies would undertake.

5000|$|The {{code name}} [...] "Zvuk" [...] (Sound) {{appears in the}} Venona decryptions as a Soviet source and has been {{identified}} as Jacob Golos. In these decrypts, Golos is identified as an “illegal colleague,” generally meaning a Soviet officer or professional agent who operated without the protection of <b>diplomatic</b> or official <b>status</b> with a Soviet embassy or consulate. Soviet officers with the latter status were said to be “legal.” ...|$|R
25|$|According to Novak and Evans, Letelier {{was able}} to receive funding of $5,000 a month from the Cuban {{government}} and {{under the supervision of}} Beatriz Allende, he used his contacts within the Institute for Policy Studies and western human rights groups to organize a campaign within the United Nations as well as the U.S. Congress to isolate Augusto Pinochet’s dictatorship. Novak and Evans claimed this was part of an organized campaign to put pressure on Pinochet's government closely coordinated by the Cuban and Soviet governments, using individuals like Letelier to implement these efforts. Letelier’s briefcase also allegedly contained his address book, which contained the names of dozens of known and suspected Eastern Bloc intelligence agents. All correspondence between Letelier and individuals in Cuba was supposedly handled via Julian Rizo, who used his <b>diplomatic</b> <b>status</b> to hide his activities.|$|E
25|$|Interested in {{politics}} and diplomacy, Oppenheim tried to join the diplomatic corps but the Auswärtiges Amt (Foreign Office) rejected him due to the Jewish background of his father. Using well-connected friends — including Paul Graf von Hatzfeldt — Oppenheim succeeded in being accepted as an attaché (which did not bestow <b>diplomatic</b> <b>status)</b> at the German General Consulate in Cairo. In June 1896, he arrived in Cairo {{which was to be}} his home for the next thirteen years. Not issued with any specific instructions, he made use of his freedom to engage in freelance activities, sending reports of his impressions to his superiors in Berlin (over the years totaling around 500). However, most of his messages were simply filed without comment, only rarely distributed more widely within the diplomatic service. Oppenheim was more successful in establishing a network of upper class acquaintances in Cairo, both European and local.|$|E
500|$|Two days later, Dupont {{announced}} that he had issued a letter of accreditation to Reedman for presentation to Nogueira. The envoy would not present credentials, Dupont explained, as he was representing the Rhodesian government, and not its head of state, Queen Elizabeth II. The Deputy Prime Minister expressed confusion regarding the appointment's discussion at NATO, saying that Rhodesia was far outside the organisation's geographical area of responsibility. He said that the letter of accreditation would confer on Reedman the title of [...] "Accredited Diplomatic Representative", and that Reedman would thereafter head the [...] "Rhodesian Diplomatic Mission" [...] in Lisbon, which would operate on the same level as the Rhodesian office in Pretoria. The Portuguese Foreign Ministry quickly issued a statement correcting Dupont's wording, saying that Reedman would lead the [...] "Rhodesian Mission", with no reference to <b>diplomatic</b> <b>status.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Moffat {{went out}} as a [...] "statistical agent" [...] of USDA's Division of Statistics but with the status of Deputy Consul General on the roster of the Department of State at London. [...] Subsequent USDA {{officials}} assigned overseas, however, did not enjoy <b>diplomatic</b> or consular <b>status.</b> This impeded their work, which at that point consisted mainly of collecting, analyzing, and transmitting to Washington time-sensitive market information on agricultural commodities.|$|R
5000|$|The Syrian Constitution states [...] "Every citizen has {{the right}} to liberty of {{movement}} within the territory of the State unless prohibited therefrom under the terms of a court order or public health and safety regulations.". In its mandated report on human rights to the United Nations, Syria has argued that because of this constitutional protection: [...] "in Syria, no laws or measures restrict the liberty of movement or choice of residence of citizens". Legislative Decree No. 29 of 1970 regulates the right of foreigners to enter, reside in and leave the territory of Syria, and is the controlling document regarding the issuance of passports, visas, and <b>diplomatic</b> travel <b>status.</b> The document specifically states [...] "The latter provision is intended merely to ensure that our country is not the final destination of stateless persons." ...|$|R
50|$|The Centre for Foreign Relations (CFR) {{is one of}} {{the high}} {{learning}} institutions in Tanzania. The CFR was established in 1978, {{as a result of an}} agreement between the governments of the United Republic of Tanzania and the Republic of Mozambique. The Centre has been incorporated in Immunities and Privileges Act No. 5 (1986). This incorporation conferred the Centre with the <b>status</b> of a <b>Diplomatic</b> Institution, a <b>status</b> which the Centre continues to enjoy to date.|$|R
500|$|MacGregor quickly {{moved his}} family back to London, where the furore {{following}} the Poyais survivors' return had died down. In {{the midst of a}} serious economic downturn, some investors had subscribed to the £300,000 Poyais loan issued by Thomas Jenkins & Company—apparently believing the assertion of the Cazique's publicists that the previous loans had defaulted only because of embezzlement by one of his agents. MacGregor was arrested soon after his arrival back in Britain, and held at Tothill Fields Bridewell in Westminster for about a week before being released without charge. He initiated a new, less ornate version of the Poyais scheme, describing himself simply as the [...] "Cacique of the Republic of Poyais". The new Poyaisian office at 23 Threadneedle Street made none of the claims to <b>diplomatic</b> <b>status</b> the old Poyaisian legation at Dowgate Hill had done.|$|E
500|$|The most {{recognisable}} item of the herald's wardrobe {{has always}} been their tabards. Since the 13th century, records of this distinctive garment were apparent. At first {{it is likely that}} the herald wore his master's cast-off coat, but even from the beginning that would have had special significance, signifying that he was in effect his master's representative. Especially when his master was a sovereign prince, the wearing of his coat would haven given the herald a natural <b>diplomatic</b> <b>status.</b> John Anstis wrote that: [...] "The Wearing the outward Robes of the Prince, hath been esteemed by the Consent of Nations, to be an extraordinary Instance of Favour and Honour, as in the Precedent of Mordecai, under a king of Persia." [...] The last King of England to have worn a tabard with his arms was probably King Henry VII. Today the herald's tabard is a survivor of history, much like the judges' wigs and (until the last century) the bishop's gaiters.|$|E

5000|$|Although Taiwan {{continues}} to exercise autonomy and to term itself ‘The Republic of China’, {{this is not}} recognised in international law. Taiwan’s official status {{is that of a}} Province of China...Ireland recognises the Government of the PRC as the sole legitimate government of China. Ireland does not maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan and there is no inter-Governmental contact between the two sides. A Taipei Representative Office, established in Dublin in 1988, has a representative function in relation to economic and cultural promotion, but no <b>diplomatic</b> or political <b>status.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On February 8, 2014 Khobragade moved for her visa fraud {{charge to}} be dismissed, {{reasoning}} {{that the country}} had no authority over her as she was granted diplomatic immunity when the indictment case was filed. The prosecution opposed the motion, reasoning: [...] "Having left the U.S. and returned to India, the defendant currently has no <b>diplomatic</b> or consular <b>status</b> in the U.S., and the consular level immunity that she did have at the relevant times does not give her immunity from the charges in this case, crimes arising out of non-official acts." ...|$|R
