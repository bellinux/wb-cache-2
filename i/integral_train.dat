30|$|The GVCA method {{based on}} {{horizontally}} grouped training set is {{as shown in}} Algorithm  2. Meanwhile, regarding the problem of too high eigenvector dimension of training set, a feasible approach is to group the features, i.e., to randomly group a feature set into several non-intersecting subsets, and project the originally <b>integral</b> <b>training</b> set into those feature sets, thereby composing several new grouped training sets. After that, the original VCA method is used to obtain vanishing component polynomial respectively, and finally, the vanishing component polynomial in multiple grouped training sets is combined into the vanishing component polynomial in an <b>integral</b> <b>training</b> set. This approach is called the vertical grouping method. The GVCA method based on vertically grouping training sets is as shown in Algorithm  3. Furthermore, to handle both problems of over-scaled training set and too high eigenvector dimension, the horizontal and vertical grouping approaches can be applied simultaneously.|$|R

30|$|Grouping the {{training}} set: this paper proposed the GVCA method to address two situations of over-scaled training set and too high dimension of eigenvector. Regarding {{the problem of}} over-scaled training set, it is a practicable way to group the examples, i.e., to horizontally segment the entire training set into several training subsets (for instance, take 10 / 20 / 30 / 40 / 50 examples as a group), then acquire the features (i.e., vanishing component polynomial) by the original VCA method respectively and combine the vanishing component polynomial in multiple grouped training sets into the vanishing component polynomial in an <b>integral</b> <b>training</b> set. This approach is called the horizontal grouping method.|$|R

40|$|Context: Baseball {{throwing}} {{injuries are}} common. Emphasis on injury prevention and rehabilitation {{is made in}} an attempt to keep athletes on the fi eld of competition. Interval throwing programs are an <b>integral</b> part of <b>training,</b> conditioning, and returning an injured baseball player to the game. Evidence Acquisition: Development of data-driven programs was based on the number, type, distance, and intensity of throws during games, across the spectrum of ages and positions for baseball athletes at all levels of play. Statistical analysis by age, position, and level of play determined the need for separate throwing programs. Means, the high range, game rules, and practical considerations were used to develop each data-based interval throwing program. Results: Data-based age and level-of-play interval throwing programs for pitchers, catchers, infi elders, and outfi elders have been developed, tested, and implemented for more than 10 years. Progression is based on type and location of injury, symptoms in response to throwing, and preinjury performance profi le. Although the throwing programs are highly structured, there is ample opportunity to modify them {{to meet the needs of}} individual athletes. Conclusion: Data-based interval throwing programs for baseball athletes are an <b>integral</b> <b>training</b> and conditioning element for both injured and uninjured athletes who are preparing for sports participation. Medical team members should equip themselves with an understanding of how to use the programs for safe training, conditioning, and return to play...|$|R

40|$|Currently {{one of the}} {{fundamental}} processes in public and private universities is the linking process with the socioeconomic context as an important way to train professionals that society requires. While more efficient it is, greater advantages and benefits are for the different stakeholders, particularly students. The linking at the Faculty of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering (FIME) of the University of Nuevo León State (UANL) of Mexico with industry and society in general is a process that, since its conception in 1960, has served as a driver process for important achievements, although, as a dynamic and multifactorial process requires constant improvement. This improvement must be based on knowledge of its actual state.

Under a methodological positivist approach placed in descriptive research of field. For this study, authors worked with the teachers of the Bolivarian middle school “Antonio Nicolás Briceño” placed in municipality Valera, Trujillo state on which the sample was formed by 13 teachers of different learning areas.

30|$|This paper {{analyzed}} the characteristics and existing {{problems of the}} VCA method, and then improved it from both aspects to form a GVCA method. (1) The classification decision function {{is based on the}} sorting of values that vanishing components take from tested data, while the non-vanishing component makes its decision depending on the number of value being zero taken from tested data. This avoids the problem of not easily set threshold of classification decision function for the VCA method and enhances feasibility in real application. (2) A strategy of grouping training set was proposed, which segmented training set into several non-intersecting subsets, solved the vanishing polynomial on subset, and combined them into the vanishing component polynomial set of an <b>integral</b> <b>training</b> set, to apply {{to solve the problem of}} large-scaled training set. (3) The integrated learning theory was utilized to prove the correctness of the strategy of grouping training set. The analysis of time complexity before and after grouping demonstrates it can effectively reduce computational time. A series of experimental results show that the GVCA method obtains a perfect experimental performance and quicker convergence compared to other classification algorithms.|$|R

A QUAN-QUAL methodology was used with instruments like questionnaires applied to the young participants and interviews with the workshop facilitators and administrative staff. Guitar, painting and theatre workshops were given, through which the development of new artistic expression skills was achieved, as well as contributing to the strengthening of social behaviors such as tolerance, patience and interpersonal communication, among others. It was found the constant need of having permanent programs of <b>integral</b> <b>training,</b> both in the field of artistic training and socio-emotional, giving priority to groups at risk, such as students of the boarding school that mostly come from families of scarce resources, some of the low performance academic and aggressive behavior.

40|$|Two major trends can be {{identified}} for powertrain control in the next decade. The legislation will more and more focus on in-use emissions. Together with the global trend to reduce the CO 2 emissions, this will lead to an <b>integral</b> drive <b>train</b> approach. To develop and validate this <b>integral</b> drive <b>train</b> approach, {{the need for a}} new chapter in powertrain testing arises. The climatic-altitude chamber, suited for heavy vehicles, serves a wide variety of testing needs. Ambient temperature can be controlled between â 45 °C and + 55 °C and ambient pressure can be reduced up to a level found at an altitude to 4000 meters. The chamber's dynamometers enable transient testing of heavy-duty engines and vehicles and the chamber is equipped with a comprehensive array of emission measurement capabilities, working under extreme conditions. With the final design of the chamber, three types of powertrain test set-ups are possible: Engine tests Engine in vehicle tests (engine speed versus torque cycles, e. g. WHTC simulation) Vehicle tests for road and non-road applications (real-world emission and performance) By testing the complete vehicle under varying ambient conditions, the interactions between subsystems can be studied and the robustness of products can be enhanced. With this tool, development, pre-calibration and performance evaluation of powertrain control systems is performed in a reliable and efficient test environment. To deal with the increasing complexity of powertrains and optimize overall performance, model-based control will become the standard in the coming decade. In that case, advanced models that accurately predict the powertrain performance under real-life conditions can be developed and validated using this facility. The availability of accurate models opens the route to model-based calibration and advanced diagnostics and optimal control based on models embedded in the controller.
