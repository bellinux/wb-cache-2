30|$|The maximum {{tolerable}} dose (MTD) {{was defined}} as the <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> at which there was a 1 / 3 probability to experience a dose-limiting event averaged over the cycles 1 â€“ 5. The following events were defined as dose-limiting (1) recovery of WBC (> 2500 /mm 3) later than day 15, (2) recovery of plt count (> 80.000 /mm 3) later than day 15, (3) active infection preventing start of next course. A generalization to parallel accrual of the up and down sampling scheme described by Storer et al. (Storer 1989) was developed to determine the idarubicin <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> for a new patient. The sampling algorithm made use of all the information on toxicities and dose-limiting events observed in the CIVEP cycles number one to five of patients who had been treated before. Essentially, a patient was assigned to the next higher <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> once two cycles, who had been treated at the current or a higher <b>dose</b> <b>level,</b> did not experience a dose-limiting event. The <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> for a new patient was decreased by one step if a patient experienced a dose-limiting event during a cycle at the current or a lower <b>dose</b> <b>level.</b> Toxicity results that did not have an immediate effect on the current dose by these rules were queued to have an effect in case a change in the current <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> rendered them relevant. Using this sampling scheme the current <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> oscillates stochastically around the maximal tolerable dose. A close telephone monitoring after each of the chemotherapy courses was necessary to gather the information from treating physicians whether the retreatment on day 16 was possible. If this was not the case, the patient <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> had to be reduced for the following cycles by one <b>dose</b> <b>level.</b>|$|R

The objectives of this study were: (1) to determine the effectiveness of papaya seeds on helminths especially H. diminuta in rats and (2) to determine the effective <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> on helminths in rats. Thirty six male rats from strain Sprague-Dawley were chosen as samples in this experiment. Two types of <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> were used for papaya seeds treatments such as 0. 6 g kg- 1 and 1. 2 g kg- 1. The geometric mean (GEM) was used to calculate mean for eggs per gram (EPG) before and after the treatment to be included in the reduction percentage calculation.

25|$|The {{two issues}} of shot noise and EUV-released {{electrons}} point out two constraining factors: 1) keeping dose {{high enough to}} reduce shot noise to tolerable levels, but also 2) avoiding too high a dose due to the increased contribution of EUV-released photoelectrons and secondary electrons to the resist exposure process, increasing the edge blur and thereby limiting the resolution.

25|$|Tolerance {{occurs to}} the muscle-relaxant, anticonvulsant, and sleep-inducing effects of benzodiazepines, and upon {{cessation}} a benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome occurs.

Some people abuse benzodiazepines at very high doses and devote a lot of time to doing so, satisfying the diagnostic criteria in DSM IV for substance abuse and dependence. Another group of people include those on low to moderate therapeutic doses of benzodiazepines who do not abuse their benzodiazepines but develop a tolerance and benzodiazepine dependence. A considerable number of individuals using benzodiazepines for insomnia escalate their dosage, sometimes above therapeutically-prescribed <b>dose</b> <b>levels.</b> Tolerance to the anxiolytic effect of benzodiazepines has been clearly demonstrated in rats. In humans, there is little evidence that benzodiazepines retain their anti-anxiety effects beyond four months of continuous treatment; there is evidence that suggests that long-term use of benzodiazepines may actually worsen anxiety, which in turn may lead to dosage escalation, with one study finding 25% of patients escalated their dosage. Some authors, however, consider benzodiazepines to be effective long-term; however, it is more likely that the drugs are acting to prevent rebound anxiety withdrawal effects. Tolerance to the anticonvulsant and muscle-relaxing effects of benzodiazepines occurs within a few weeks in most patients.|$|E

However, {{the significance of these}} results on the morbidity to astronauts has not been elucidated. One model of late tissue effects [...] suggests that significant effects will occur at lower doses, but with increased latency. It is to be noted that the studies that have been conducted to date have been carried out with relatively small numbers of animals (<10 per dose group); therefore, testing of dose threshold effects at lower doses (< 0.5 Gy) has not been carried out sufficiently at this time. As the problem of extrapolating space radiation effects in animals to humans will be a challenge for space radiation research, such research could become limited by the population size that is used in animal studies. Furthermore, the role of dose protraction has not been studied to date. An approach to extrapolate existing observations to possible cognitive changes, performance degradation, or late CNS effects in astronauts has not been discovered. New approaches in systems biology offer an exciting tool to tackle this challenge. Recently, eight gaps were identified for projecting CNS risks. Research on new approaches to risk assessment may be needed to provide the necessary data and knowledge to develop risk projection models of the CNS from space radiation.|$|E

Of 10 patients assessable for response, 7 (70 %) responded at 12 weeks, with a 30 % complete response rate. Four subjects reduced steroid dose or discontinued an immunosuppressant at 12 weeks. The median decrease in steroid dose at 1 year was 61. 6 %. Infectious complications occurred predominantly in the first 3 months after therapy, but full B and T cell recovery took well over 12 months.

There is a pressing need for new affordable antidotes and clonidine {{has been shown to}} be effective in animal studies. Our aim was to determine the safety of clonidine given as an antidote in adult patients presenting with signs or symptoms of acute organophosphate ingestion. Methods This study was a dose finding, open-label, multicentre, phase II trial. Forty eight patients with acute organophosphate poisoning were randomized to receive either clonidine or placebo: Four to receive placebo and twelve to receive clonidine at each <b>dose</b> <b>level.</b> The first <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> was an initial loading dose of 0. 15 mg followed by an infusion of 0. 5 mg of clonidine over 24 hours. The initial loading dose was increased to 0. 3 mg, 0. 45 and 0. 6 mg. at all <b>dosing</b> <b>levels</b> however the subsequent infusion remained at 0. 5 mg of clonidine over 24 hours. Results The baseline characteristics of both groups were similar. The trial was stopped after completion of the 3 rd <b>dosing</b> <b>level.</b> At the 1 st and 2 nd <b>dosing</b> <b>level</b> there were no reported adverse drug reactions. At the 3 rd <b>dosing</b> <b>level</b> 5 patients (42 %) developed significant hypotension during clonidine treatment that responded to intravenous fluids. There were no statistical differences in ventilation rate, pre and post GCS, and mortality rates over all levels. Conclusion Our findings suggest use of moderate doses of clonidine in acute organophosphate poisoning can be used without causing frequent clinical problems but that higher doses are associated with a high incidence of hypotension requiring intervention. Further studies are needed to study the efficacy of clonidine as an antidote in organophosphate poisoning. Trial registration Current Controlled Trial ISRCTN 89917816. </p...|$|R

METHODS: Eligible patients had Stage III or IV (oligometastatic) NSCLC. Patients received XRT to 63 Gy in standard fractionation. Patients received concurrent carboplatin (AUC = 6) during weeks 1 and 5 of XRT, and pemetrexed during weeks 1, 3, 5, and 7 of XRT. The starting <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> (level 1) of pemetrexed was 300 mg/m 2. Following the finding of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> 1, an amended <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> (level 1 A) continued pemetrexed at 300 mg/m 2, but with involved field radiation instead of extended nodal irradiation. Consolidation consisted of carboplatin (AUC = 6) and pemetrexed (500 mg/m 2) q 3 weeks Ã— 2 - 3 cycles. RESULTS: Eighteen patients were enrolled. Fourteen patients are evaluable for toxicity analysis. Of the initial 6 patients treated on <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> 1, two experienced DLTs (one grade 4 sepsis, one prolonged grade 3 esophagitis). There was one DLT (grade 5 pneumonitis) in the 8 patients treated on <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> 1 A.

Oxaliplatin was given on day 1 of weeks 1, 3 and 5 of radiotherapy. <b>Dose</b> <b>level</b> 1 was oxaliplatin 70 [*]mg[*]mâˆ’ 2 with 5 -FU 200 [*]mg[*]mâˆ’ 2 [*]dayâˆ’ 1 continuous infusion 96 [*]h[*]weekâˆ’ 1. On <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> 2, the oxaliplatin dose was increased to 85 [*]mg[*]mâˆ’ 2. On <b>dose</b> <b>level</b> 3, the duration of the 5 -FU was increased to 168 [*]h per week. Pelvic radiotherapy was 45 [*]Gray (Gy) in 25 fractions over 5 weeks with a boost of 5. 4 [*]Gy. Fluorine- 18 fluoro deoxyglucose and Fluorine- 18 fluoro misonidazole positron emission tomography (FDG-PET and FMISO-PET) were used to assess metabolic tumour response and hypoxia. In all, 16 patients were accrued. Dose-limiting toxicities occurred in one patient at level 2 (grade 3 chest infection), and two patients at level 3 (grade 3 diarrhoea). <b>Dose</b> <b>level</b> 2 was declared the recommended <b>dose</b> <b>level.</b> FDG-PET imaging showed metabolic responses in 11 of the 12 primary tumours assessed. Four of six tumours had detectable hypoxia on FMISO-PET scans. The addition of oxaliplatin to infusional 5 -FU chemoradiotherapy was feasible and generally well tolerated. For future trials, oxaliplatin 85 [*]mg[*]mâˆ’ 2 and 5 -FU 200 [*]mg[*]mâˆ’ 2 [*]dayâˆ’ 1 continuous infusion 96 [*]h[*]weekâˆ’ 1 is the recommended dose when combined with 50. 4 [*]Gy of pelvic radiotherapy...|$|R
