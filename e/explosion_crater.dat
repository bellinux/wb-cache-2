5|$|This 150-year period next saw the {{eruption}} of less silica-rich lava {{in the form of}} andesitic ash that formed at least eight alternating light- and dark-colored layers. Blocky andesite lava then flowed from St. Helens' summit crater down the volcano's southeast flank. Later, pyroclastic flows raced down over the andesite lava and into the Kalama River valley. It ended with the emplacement of a dacite dome several hundred feet (~200 m) high at the volcano's summit, which filled and overtopped an <b>explosion</b> <b>crater</b> already at the summit. Large parts of the dome's sides broke away and mantled parts of the volcano's cone with talus. Lateral explosions excavated a notch in the southeast crater wall. St. Helens reached its greatest height and achieved its highly symmetrical form by the time the Kalama eruptive cycle ended, about 1647. The volcano remained quiet for the next 150 years.|$|E
25|$|Lake Nyos fills {{a roughly}} {{circular}} maar in the Oku Volcanic Field, an <b>explosion</b> <b>crater</b> caused when a lava flow interacted violently with groundwater. The maar {{is believed to}} have formed in an eruption about 400years ago, and is 1,800m (5,900ft) across and 208m (682ft) deep. The area has been volcanically active for millions of years—after South America and Africa were split apart by plate tectonics about 110million years ago, West Africa also experienced rifting, although to a lesser degree. The rift is known as the Mbéré Rift Valley, and crustal extension has allowed magma to reach the surface along a line extending through Cameroon. Mount Cameroon also lies on this fault line. Lake Nyos is surrounded by old lava flows and pyroclastic deposits.|$|E

2500|$|Following {{the opening}} statements, the {{prosecution}} began presenting witnesses. Crucial testimony at Cherry's trial was delivered by his former wife, Willadean Brogdon, whom Cherry had married in 1970. Brogdon testified on May 16 that Cherry had boasted {{to her that}} he had been the individual who had planted the bomb beneath the steps to the church, then returned hours later to light the fuse upon the dynamite. Brogdon also testified that Cherry had informed her of his regret that children had died in the bombing, before adding of his contentment that they would never reproduce. Although the credibility of Brogdon's testimony was called into dispute at the trial, forensic experts did concede that, although her account of the planting of the bombing differed from that which had been discussed in the previous perpetrators' trials, Brogdon's recollection of Cherry's account of the planting and subsequent lighting of the bomb could explain why no conclusive remnants of a timing device were subsequently discovered after the bombing. (A fishing float attached to a section of wire which may have been part of a timing device was found 20 feet from the <b>explosion</b> <b>crater</b> following the bombing, although one of several vehicles heavily damaged in the explosion was found to have carried fishing tackle.) ...|$|E

50|$|Rootless cones, {{also called}} pseudocraters, are {{volcanic}} cones {{that are not}} directly associated with a conduit that brought magma to the surface from a deep-seated magma reservoir. Generally, three types of rootless cones, littoral cones, <b>explosion</b> <b>craters,</b> and hornitos are recognized. Littoral cones and <b>explosion</b> <b>craters</b> {{are the result of}} mild explosions that were generated locally by the interaction of either hot lava or pyroclastic flows with water. Littoral cones typically form on the surface of a basaltic lava flow where it has entered into a body of water, usually a sea or ocean. <b>Explosion</b> <b>craters</b> form where either hot lava or pyroclastic flows have covered either marshy ground or water-saturated ground of some sort. Hornitos are rootless cones that are composed welded lava fragments and were formed on the surface of basaltic lava flows by the escape of gas and clots of molten lava through cracks or other openings in the crust of a lava flow.|$|R

Features called chaos occur on the surface of Europa s floating ice shell. Chaos is defined as a region in which the background plains have been disrupted. Common features of chaos include rafted blocks of pre-existing terrain suspended in a matrix of smooth or hummocky material; low surface albedo; and structural control on chaos outline shape by pre-existing lineaments. All published models of chaos formation call on endogenic processes whereby chaos forms through thermal processes. Nonetheless, we note morphological similarities between terrestrial <b>explosion</b> <b>craters</b> and Europan chaos at a range of scales and consider whether some chaos may have formed by impact.

40|$|Theoretical depths, {{volumes of}} excavation, hinge radii, {{ejection}} angles and transient structural rim uplifts are calculated, for comparison with experimental and field data from impact and <b>explosion</b> <b>craters,</b> {{by means of}} a Maxwell Z-model cratering flow field originating at non-zero depths-of-burst. It is found that the formation of a hinge, about which the coherent ejecta flap rotates at the rim of the transient crater, divides material in the flow field into ejected and downward and outward-driven portions. Ejected material originates from an excavation cavity whose geometry is distinct from that of the transient crater. The shallow depths of excavation both observed in impact and <b>explosion</b> <b>craters</b> and predicted by the Z-model flow fields imply that thickness estimates of such lunar geologic units as the maria basalts, which are determined by assuming that excavation depths are similar to (1) final or (2) transient crater depths, must be reduced by factors of two to three respectively. It is concluded that lunar basin excavation cavities exhibit proportional growth, and have maximum depths of excavation near 0. 1 the diameter of the basin transient crater...|$|R
