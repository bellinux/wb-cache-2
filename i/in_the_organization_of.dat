5|$|On the {{recommendation}} of Simon Bolivar Buckner, the former commander of the Kentucky State Militia who had also joined the Army of the Confederate States, Breckinridge was commissioned as a brigadier general in the Confederate Army on November 2, 1861. On November 16, he was given command of the 1st Kentucky Brigade. Nicknamed the Orphan Brigade because its men felt orphaned by Kentucky's Unionist state government, the brigade was in Buckner's 2nd Division of the Army of Mississippi, commanded by General Albert Sidney Johnston. For several weeks, he trained his troops in the city, and he also participated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>organization</b> <b>of</b> a provisional Confederate government for the state.

5|$|Rugby {{union was}} not {{played at the}} 1904 games in St. Louis, nor at the 1906 Intercalated Games, but was {{included}} in 1908, when the Olympics were held in the sport's native country. The Rugby Football Union (RFU) was involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>organization</b> <b>of</b> the sport at this edition of the Olympics. Like the 1900 games, three teams entered: Australasia (representing Australia and New Zealand), France, and hosts Great Britain (which included {{the whole of the}} United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland). France pulled out prior to the commencement of the tournament, being unable to field a representative team. Australasia was represented by the Wallabies, who were already on tour in Britain. As the best English and Welsh players were on tour in New Zealand at the time, Great Britain was represented by the Cornwall county team, who were chosen by the RFU as an appropriate side after they defeated Durham in the 1907 English county championship. The choice of Cornwall was controversial, as only three of their players had ever represented England and the Wallabies had defeated them 18 points to five.|$|E

The T30 was eventually replaced by the M8 HMC, which was based on the M5 Stuart light tank, and which began entering service around {{the same time as the}} T30. Only 312 T30 HMCs were delivered in their original configuration, as the last 188 were converted back into M3 Half-tracks before they were delivered.
