40|$|We {{present a}} general {{formalism}} {{to the problem}} of perfect state transfer (PST), where the state involves multiple excitations of the quantum network. A key feature of our formalism is that it allows for inclusion of nontrivial interactions between the excitations.

The general formalism <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>flexible</b> enough to account for situations where multiple excitations are "focused" onto the same site...|$|R

These models <b>are</b> <b>also</b> <b>flexible,</b> extensible, customizable, database-neutral, and platform-independent. This paper also presents an SQLlike query language, named Annotation Query Language (AnQL), to query annotation documents. AnQL is simple to understand and exploits the already-existent wide knowledge and skill set of SQL. I...|$|R

We evaluate our system against an alternative providing differential privacy both during profile construction and dissemination. Results show that our solution preserves accuracy {{without the need for}} users to reveal their preferences. Our approach <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>flexible</b> and more robust to censorship...|$|R
