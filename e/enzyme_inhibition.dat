5|$|Slow-tight {{inhibition}} {{occurs when}} the initial enzyme–inhibitor complex EI undergoes isomerisation to a second more tightly held complex, EI*, but the overall inhibition process is reversible. This manifests itself as slowly increasing <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibition.</b> Under these conditions, traditional Michaelis–Menten kinetics give a false value for Ki, which is time–dependent. The true value of Ki can be obtained through more complex analysis of the on (kon) and off (koff) rate constants for inhibitor association. See irreversible inhibition below for more information.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} uses for enzyme inhibitors are as drugs to treat disease. Many of these inhibitors target a human enzyme and aim {{to correct a}} {{pathological}} condition. However, not all drugs are enzyme inhibitors. Some, such as anti-epileptic drugs, alter enzyme activity by causing more or less of the enzyme to be produced. These effects are called enzyme induction and inhibition and are alterations in gene expression, which is unrelated {{to the type of}} <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibition</b> discussed here. Other drugs interact with cellular targets that are not enzymes, such as ion channels or membrane receptors.|$|E
5|$|The {{reactive}} {{oxygen species}} produced in cells include hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hypochlorous acid (HClO), and free radicals such as the hydroxyl radical (·OH) and the superoxide anion (O2−). The hydroxyl radical is particularly unstable and will react rapidly and non-specifically with most biological molecules. This species is produced from hydrogen peroxide in metal-catalyzed redox reactions such as the Fenton reaction. These oxidants can damage cells by starting chemical chain reactions such as lipid peroxidation, or by oxidizing DNA or proteins. Damage to DNA can cause mutations and possibly cancer, if not reversed by DNA repair mechanisms, while damage to proteins causes <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibition,</b> denaturation and protein degradation.|$|E

5|$|Physiological <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibition</b> {{can also}} be {{produced}} by specific protein inhibitors. This mechanism occurs in the pancreas, which synthesises many digestive precursor enzymes known as zymogens. Many of these are activated by the trypsin protease, so {{it is important to}} inhibit the activity of trypsin in the pancreas to prevent the organ from digesting itself. One way in which the activity of trypsin is controlled is the production of a specific and potent trypsin inhibitor protein in the pancreas. This inhibitor binds tightly to trypsin, preventing the trypsin activity that would otherwise be detrimental to the organ. Although the trypsin inhibitor is a protein, it avoids being hydrolysed as a substrate by the protease by excluding water from trypsin's active site and destabilising the transition state. Other examples of physiological enzyme inhibitor proteins include the barstar inhibitor of the bacterial ribonuclease barnase and the inhibitors of protein phosphatases.|$|E

Many studies have showed high temperatures not only lead to direct injuries including protein denaturation and aggregation, increased fluidity of membrane lipids, but also to indirect heat injuries like cell dehydration, inactivation of <b>enzymes,</b> <b>inhibition</b> of protein synthesis and loss of membrane integrity, and eventually result in severe cellular injury and even cell death (Wahid et al., 2007; Hanumappa and Nguyen, 2010).|$|R
25|$|A {{classical}} example includes anti-epileptic drugs. Phenytoin, for example, induces CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. Substrates for {{the latter}} may be drugs with critical dosage, like amiodarone or carbamazepine, whose blood plasma concentration may either increase because of <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibition</b> in the former, or decrease because of enzyme induction in the latter.|$|E
25|$|Attaching ionic ligands to {{nanoparticles}} allows {{control over}} enzyme activity. An example of <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibition</b> {{is given by}} binding of a-chymotrypsin (ChT), an enzyme with a largely cationic active site. When a-chymotrypsin is incubated with anionic (negatively charged) nanoparticles, ChT activity is inhibited as anionic nanoparticles bind to the active site. Enzyme activity can be restored {{by the addition of}} cationic surfactants. Alkyl surfactants form a bilayer around ChT, whereas thiol and alcohol surfactants alter the surface of ChT such that interactions with nanoparticles are interrupted. Though formation of a protein-nanoparticle complex can inhibit enzyme activity, studies show that it can also stabilize protein structure, and significantly protect the protein from denaturization.|$|E
25|$|A {{range of}} polysaccharides {{have been found}} in the {{extracellular}} and intracellular compartments of M. plumbeus including fucose, glucose, galactose and mannose. Glucuronic acid, a carbohydrate with a similar structure to glucose, is located specifically in the extracellular region of M. plumbeus. The monosaccharide glucosamine was found only in the intracellular regions of M. plumbeus. Mucor plumbeus has the ability to detoxify pentachlorophenol and has been used in the biotransformation of other products. Incubation of M. plumbeus with the natural product maalioxide produces three metabolites (1,7 and 9 β-hydroxymaalioxide). Mucor plumbeus activity towards camphorquinone is stereoselective. Extracts of Mucor plumbeus have shown acetylcholinesterase <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibition</b> activity. Mucor plumbeus is able to biocatalyze the hydroxylation of terpenes and steroids by cytochrome p450 enzymes in the presence of O and cofactor NADPH. Mucor plumbeus also transforms sesquiterpene into a series of 12 degradation products of 10,15-epoxidation. As well, squamulosone (aromadendr-1(10)-en-9-one) is biotransformed by M. plumbeus to yield an array of terpenes.|$|E

In others, it substitutes for potassium in several roles, such as maintaining turgor pressure and aiding {{in the opening}} and closing of stomata. Excess sodium in the soil can limit [...] the uptake of water by decreasing the water potential, which may result in plant wilting; excess concentrations in the cytoplasm can lead to <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibition,</b> which in turn causes necrosis and chlorosis. In response, some plants have developed mechanisms to limit sodium uptake in the roots, to store it in cell vacuoles, and restrict salt transport from roots to leaves; excess sodium may also be stored in old plant tissue, limiting the damage to new growth.

2500|$|Many drugs may {{increase}} or decrease the activity of various CYP isozymes either by inducing the biosynthesis of an isozyme [...] (enzyme induction) or by directly inhibiting {{the activity of the}} CYP (<b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibition).</b> This is a major source of adverse drug interactions, since changes in CYP enzyme activity may affect the metabolism and clearance of various drugs. For example, if one drug inhibits the CYP-mediated metabolism of another drug, the second drug may accumulate within the body to toxic levels. Hence, these drug interactions may necessitate dosage adjustments or choosing drugs that do not interact with the CYP system. Such drug interactions are especially important to take into account when using drugs of vital importance to the patient, drugs with important side-effects and drugs with small therapeutic windows, but any drug may be subject to an altered plasma concentration due to altered drug metabolism.|$|E
5|$|Substrate {{and product}} {{inhibition}} is where either the substrate or {{product of an}} enzyme reaction inhibit the <b>enzyme's</b> activity. This <b>inhibition</b> may follow the competitive, uncompetitive or mixed patterns. In substrate inhibition there is a progressive decrease in activity at high substrate concentrations. This may indicate the existence of two substrate-binding sites in the enzyme. At low substrate, the high-affinity site is occupied and normal kinetics are followed.

Besides this type of inhibition, nitrogen mustards produced other <b>enzyme</b> <b>inhibitions.</b> In vitro studies with enzymes are an indication that such enzymatic reactions might be inhibited in experiments with tissues or in in ~iro experiments. However, there is no certainty that they would actually be found, {{not only because the}} necessary concentrations might not be present, but also because the compound might trove been transformed into others of different constitution or might have combined with other substances present in the extraceUular milieu. We present in this paper studies on the effect of nitrogen mustards on tissue metabolism. Experiments with tissues permit the study of biochemical reactions which have not yet been accomplished in cell-free systems.
