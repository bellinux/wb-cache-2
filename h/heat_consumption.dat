50|$|The fuel is {{injected}} part-way up the shaft, producing maximum temperature at this point. The fresh feed fed {{in at the}} top is first dried then heated to 800 °C, where de-carbonation begins, and proceeds progressively faster as the temperature rises. Below the burner, the hot lime transfers heat to, and is cooled by, the combustion air. A mechanical grate withdraws the lime at the bottom. A fan draws the gases through the kiln, and the level in the kiln is kept constant by adding feed through an airlock. As with batch kilns, only large, graded stone can be used, {{in order to ensure}} uniform gas-flows through the charge. The degree of burning can be adjusted by changing the rate of withdrawal of lime. <b>Heat</b> <b>consumption</b> as low as 4 MJ/kg is possible, but 4.5 to 5 MJ/kg is more typical.

50|$|When a solar {{water heating}} and hot-water {{central heating system}} are used together, solar heat will either be {{concentrated}} in a pre-heating tank that feeds into the tank heated by the central heating, or the solar heat exchanger will replace the lower heating element and the upper element will remain to provide for supplemental heat. However, the primary need for central heating is at night and in winter when solar gain is lower. Therefore, solar water heating for washing and bathing is often a better application than central heating because supply and demand are better matched. In many climates, a solar hot water system can provide up to 85% of domestic hot water energy. This can include domestic non-electric concentrating solar thermal systems. In many northern European countries, combined hot water and space heating systems (solar combisystems) are used to provide 15 to 25% of home heating energy. When combined with storage, large scale solar heating can provide 50-97% of annual <b>heat</b> <b>consumption</b> for district heating.|$|E

This thesis discusses the influences that determine space heating and ventilation system <b>heat</b> <b>consumption.</b> Data with different resolutions capture <b>heat</b> <b>consumption</b> variations to different degrees. Data with higher resolutions introduce more information into calculations. However, the dynamic processes of heat transfer make data with higher resolutions less suitable for calculation than data with lower resolutions. This thesis evaluates the extent of different influences (outdoor air temperature, wind speed and solar radiation) through stepwise regression analysis of the <b>heat</b> <b>consumption</b> of six space heating and five ventilation systems. A comparison {{of the goodness of}} fit between calculations with data with different resolutions shows the extent of variation due to the heat transfer dynamic processes. <b>Heat</b> <b>consumption</b> predictions for four ways of grouping data (hourly, hour-of-day grouping, mean values grouped by regimes and daily data) are compared. Calculations with daily data produced the most accurate predictions of <b>heat</b> <b>consumption</b> in analyses presented in representative literature and articles. There is a strong interest in producing hourly <b>heat</b> <b>consumption</b> predictions because they are more suitable for operation and maintenance problem detection. The <b>heat</b> <b>consumption</b> of HVAC systems operating with control regimes has not been evaluated in the relevant literature. Calculations with daily data collected from a system with control regimes might produce less accurate predictions than calculations with other data. This thesis analyzes excluding outliers to improve the accuracy of the model and explores necessary monitoring period length in order to obtain accurate predictions. Heat transfer dynamic processes (the thermal storage effect) are generally considered to be insignificant in the literature for daily <b>heat</b> <b>consumption.</b> Introducing the time-lagged variable that describes changes in the mean daily temperature will show if the thermal storage effect significantly influences daily <b>heat</b> <b>consumption.</b>   A tool developed in Matlab is used for problem detection in the operation of nineteen buildings of Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). Linear regression calculations are incorporated in the tool. Operation and maintenance problems are detected by comparing actual and modeled <b>heat</b> <b>consumption.</b> The resulting predictions were accurate enough to recognize system operation faults.
