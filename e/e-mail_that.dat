In response to the Above the Law article, Loyola Dean Victor Gold wrote in a campus-wide <b>e-mail</b> <b>that</b> Above the Law [...] "misrepresents our policy, omits some key facts, and gets others wrong."

Furthermore, any student whose transfer application was rejected could apply for reinstatement in the OCI program. However, Above the Law noted that Gold did not dispute that Loyola banned tuition-paying students whose applications were still pending from participating in OCI.
