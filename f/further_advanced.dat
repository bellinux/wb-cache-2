5|$|His {{military}} career {{can be traced}} back as far as 1304 when he took part in a campaign in the Scottish Wars. In 1309, he received a royal order to assist Robert de Clifford in the defence of the Marches against Scotland. His standing in local affairs was <b>further</b> <b>advanced</b> in 1311, when he was appointed sheriff of Cumberland, like his father had been before him. This was followed by his election as Knight of the Shire in 1312, and in December 1313, he distinguished himself {{as the leader of the}} defence against a Scottish invasion. He received further acclaim in the summer of 1315, when he successfully defended Carlisle Castle against a siege by Robert the Bruce. For this he was awarded a gift of 1000 marks from the king.|$|E
5|$|Western Australia has a {{significant}} share of the Australia's uranium reserves, but between 2002 and 2008, a statewide ban on uranium mining was in force. The ban was lifted when the Liberal Party was voted into power in the state and, as of 2010, many companies are exploring for uranium in Western Australia. One of the industry's major players, the mining company BHP Billiton, planned to develop the Yeelirrie uranium project in a 17billion dollar project. Two other projects in Western Australia are <b>further</b> <b>advanced</b> then BHP's Yeelirrie, these being the Lake Way uranium project, which is pursued by Toro Energy, and the Lake Maitland uranium project, pursued by Mega Uranium. But {{it is unlikely that}} any new projects will enter active development until the market improves. As of 2013 uranium prices are very low.|$|E

In the 17th century, {{the government of the}} 5th Dalai Lama outlawed the Jonang school, closing down or forcibly converting most of its monasteries. The writings of Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen, Taranatha, and other prominent zhentong scholars were banned. Ironically, it was also at this time that the Gelug school absorbed much of the Jonang Kālacakra tradition.|$|E
25|$|Young {{commanded}} a frigate in the Mediterranean {{for the rest}} of the French Revolutionary Wars, paying her off at the peace. He did not immediately return to service with the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars, and it was not until 1807 that he commissioned a 74-gun ship and joined the expedition to Copenhagen. Promoted to flag rank towards the end of the Napoleonic Wars, Young was <b>further</b> <b>advanced</b> to vice-admiral in 1830, and died three years later with the rank of vice-admiral of the white.|$|E

25|$|The {{success of}} the AS 332 Super Puma led {{to the pursuit of}} {{extended}} development programs to produce <b>further</b> <b>advanced</b> models. Features included lengthened rotor blades, more powerful engines and gearboxes, increases in takeoff weight, and modernised avionics. A wide variety of specialised Super Puma variants followed the basic transport model into use, including dedicated Search and rescue (SAR) and Anti-submarine warfare (ASW) versions. Military Super Pumas have been marketed as the AS532 Cougar since 1990. As a fallback option to the NHIndustries NH90, a Mark III Super Puma was also considered for development.|$|E
25|$|Edward Charles Jeffrey {{was one of}} {{the early}} evo-devo {{researchers}} of the 20th century. He performed a comparative analyses of the vasculatures of living and fossil gymnosperms and {{came to the conclusion that}} the storage parenchyma has been derived from tracheids. His research focussed primarily on plant anatomy in the context of phylogeny. This tradition of evolutionary analyses of plant architectures was <b>further</b> <b>advanced</b> by Katherine Esau, best known for her book The Plant Anatomy. Her work focussed on the origin and development of various tissues in different plants. Working with Vernon Cheadle, she also explained the evolutionary specialization of the phloem tissue with respect to its function.|$|E
25|$|James Small <b>further</b> <b>advanced</b> the design. Using {{mathematical}} methods he {{experimented with}} various designs until {{he arrived at}} a shape cast from {{a single piece of}} iron, an improvement on the Scots plough of James Anderson of Hermiston. A single-piece cast iron plough was also developed and patented by Charles Newbold in the United States. This was again improved on by Jethro Wood, a blacksmith of Scipio, New York, who made a three-part Scots Plough that allowed a broken piece to be replaced. In 1837 John Deere introduced the first steel plough; it was so much stronger than iron designs that it could work soil in areas of the US that had previously been considered unsuitable for farming.|$|E

25|$|Dacres was {{promoted}} to Rear-Admiral of the Blue on 14 February 1799, two {{years to the day}} after the battle of Cape St Vincent. He was <b>further</b> <b>advanced</b> to Rear-Admiral of the White on 1 January 1801, and was then appointed as second in command of the Plymouth command. With the Peace of Amiens he became Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth. With the resumption of the war he was appointed second in command on the Jamaica Station, serving under Sir John Thomas Duckworth and flying his flag in the 36-gun Franchise. He soon became considerably wealthy from the spoils of prize warfare, being appointed commander of the station in late 1804, promoted to vice admiral on 9 November 1805 and remaining in the post until 1808.|$|E
25|$|This <b>further</b> <b>advanced</b> {{model of}} the engine, {{intended}} to be a fully supersonic version of the aircraft, was partially achieved by the incorporation of a reheat jetpipe - also known as an afterburner. Extra fuel was to be burned in the tailpipe to avoid overheating the turbine blades, making use of unused oxygen present in the exhaust. To supply more air to the afterburner than could move through the fairly small engine, an augmentor fan powered by the engine was to be fitted behind the engine to draw air around the engine via ducts. These changes were estimated to provide for an addition 1,620lb of thrust when at 36,000ft and 500mph; much greater thrust gains were believed to have resulted from travelling at speeds in excess of 500mph.|$|E

25|$|On April 11, Epirote revolutionaries {{took control}} of Korçë, but four days later the Albanian Gendarmerie, led by Dutch officers, recaptured the city. As a result, the Dutch arrested and {{expelled}} the Greek Orthodox bishop Germanos, since they had proof {{that he was the}} chief instigator of the uprising, as well as other members of the town council. After the complete withdrawal of the Greek Army from the region on April 28, conflicts between the Northern Epirote forces and Albanian gendarmes broke out in several locations. Intense fighting occurred in the region of Cepo, north of Gjirokastër, where Albanian gendarmerie units tried unsuccessfully to infiltrate southwardly, facing resistance from the Northern Epirote forces. On the other hand, the Epirotes managed to advance and gain control of Erseka and <b>further</b> <b>advanced</b> on Frashër and Korçë.|$|E

He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India on 24 May 1866 and accompanied the Duke of Edinburgh on an official trip to India in 1869. He was promoted to lieutenant-general on 1 May 1872, advanced to Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India on 24 May 1873 and <b>further</b> <b>advanced</b> to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 28 May 1875.|$|E
25|$|Sonic 3D Blast {{is played}} from an {{isometric}} viewpoint in a 2D environment and uses pre-rendered 3D sprites, displaying pseudo-3D graphics. Sonic must find and destroy robots located around the zones, {{and bring the}} flickies inside them to large rings.

25|$|Mejía Colindres {{took office}} in 1929 with high hopes for his {{administration}} and his nation. Honduras seemed {{on the road to}} political and economic progress. Banana exports, then accounting for 80 percent of all exports, continued to expand. By 1930 Honduras had become the world's leading producer of the fruit, accounting for one-third of the world's supply of bananas. United Fruit had come increasingly to dominate the trade, and in 1929 it bought out the Cuyamel Fruit Company, one of its two principal remaining rivals. Because conflicts between these companies had frequently led to support for rival groups in Honduran politics, had produced a border controversy with Guatemala, and may have even contributed to revolutionary disturbances, this merger seemed to promise greater domestic tranquility. The prospect for tranquility was <b>further</b> <b>advanced</b> in 1931 when Ferrera was killed while leading one last unsuccessful effort to overthrow the government.|$|E
25|$|When {{the designs}} were {{considered}} in May 1936, {{there was concern}} that two engines would be less manoeuvrable than a single-engined design and that uneven recoil from cannon set in the wings would give less accurate fire. The conference favoured two engines with the cannon set in the nose and recommended the Supermarine 313. Although Supermarine's efforts were favoured due to their success with fast aircraft {{and the promise of}} the Spitfire which was undergoing trials, neither they nor Hawker were in a position to deliver a modified version of their single-engined designs quickly enough. Westland, which had less work and was <b>further</b> <b>advanced</b> in their project, was chosen along with the P.88 and the Type 313 for construction. A contract for two P.9s was placed in February 1937 which were expected to be flying in mid-1938. The P.88s were ordered in December along with a Supermarine design to F37/35 but both were cancelled in January.|$|E
25|$|Early {{forms of}} proto-capitalism and free markets {{were present in}} the Caliphate. An early market economy and early form of {{merchant}} capitalism developed between the 8th and 12th centuries. A vigorous monetary economy developed based on the wide circulation of a common currency (the dinar) and the integration of previously independent monetary areas. Business techniques and forms of business organization employed during this time included early contracts, bills of exchange, long-distance international trade, early forms of partnership (mufawada) such as limited partnerships (mudaraba), and early forms of credit, debt, profit, loss, capital (al-mal), capital accumulation (nama al-mal), circulating capital, capital expenditure, revenue, cheques, promissory notes, trusts (waqf), savings accounts, transactional accounts, pawning, loaning, exchange rates, bankers, money changers, ledgers, deposits, assignments, the double-entry bookkeeping system, and lawsuits. Organizational enterprises similar to corporations independent from the state also existed in the medieval Islamic world. Many of these concepts were adopted and <b>further</b> <b>advanced</b> in medieval Europe from the 13th century onwards.|$|E
