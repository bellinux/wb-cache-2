40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} strategic {{interaction between}} <b>intercontinental</b> <b>airports,</b> {{each of which}} levies airport charges paid by airlines and chooses its own capacity under conditions of congestion. Congestion from intercontinental flights is common across the airports since departure and arrival airports are linked one to one, while purely domestic traffic also uses each airport. The paper focuses on five questions. First, if both continents can strategically set separate airport charges for domestic and intercontinental flights, how will the outcome differ from the first-best solution? Second, how {{is the impact of}} strategic airport behavior affected by the extent of market power of the airlines serving the intercontinental market? Third, what happens if one continent has several competing <b>intercontinental</b> <b>airports,</b> each with its own regulator, while the other has a single airport and regulator? Fourth, how effective is a non-discrimination clause for airport charges, which prevents independent strategic use of the intercontinental charge? Fifth, what is the effect of higher airport operating costs on one continent (a result of security or immigration procedures) on the strategic outcome? The questions are addressed with an algebraic model and results are illustrated numerically. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|On April 24, 2014, Spirit Airlines {{announced}} {{new services}} from Houston to six new domestic destinations, including Atlanta, Fort Lauderdale, Kansas City, New Orleans and San Diego. In addition, Spirit added seasonal services between Houston and Minneapolis. These new flights brought its total destinations from Houston to 12 locations, making Spirit {{the second largest}} domestic airline by destinations at Houston's IAH, behind United Airlines. During September 2014, Spirit sought approval from the US Department of Transportation (DoT) to launch flights from Houston Intercontinental to Managua, San José, San Pedro Sula, San Salvador, Cancún, San José del Cabo and Toluca. With {{the addition of the}} above-mentioned routes, Spirit Airlines has increased Houston <b>Intercontinental</b> <b>Airport's</b> placement from the ninth largest focus city to the fifth largest focus city based upon the number of flights flown per week. Spirit Airlines experienced growth of 123% in weekly flight departures at Houston Intercontinental from August 2014 to August 2015.

40|$|Major {{airports}} in the United States typically have been individual entities, developed locally as self-sufficient enterprises. Only rarely have airport managers run systems of significant airports. Moreover, airports normally offer {{a broad range}} of products to all qualified clients. This local, all-purpose mode of operation is quite unusual for a competitive business. It is also inefficient and therefore likely to disappear in the coming generations. Efficient enterprises usually adopt business models that • focus on a segment of the possible markets [...] to specialize in the needs of specific clients and serve them cost-effectively; and • spread nationally and internationally [...] to achieve economies of scale and scope. This is the model for most successful manufacturers and service providers, such as Walmart or Microsoft. It {{is likely to be the}} model that will eventually prevail for airports, especially now that they are increasingly viewed as businesses rather than public services. Adoption of this proven business model will transform the airport industry from a collection of monadic activities to systems of airports. The imperatives of focus and scale are likely to effect significantly both the physical configuration and the operational aspects of airports. Airports probably will focus increasingly on serving particular clients or client groups and will develop into networks serving these markets.

So under a joint use agreement with the military, the Los Angeles Department of Airports, now called Los Angeles World Airports, built a 9,000 square foot (800 m²) terminal on leased land that opened in 1971, creating present day LA/Palmdale Regional Airport which the City of Palmdale has taken control of in an effort to establish reliable air service in the region.|$|R

40|$|The Optimized Route Capability (ORC) concept {{proposed}} by the FAA facilitates traffic managers to identify and resolve arrival flight delays caused by bottlenecks formed at arrival meter fixes when there exists imbalance between arrival fixes and runways. ORC makes use of the prediction capability of existing automation tools, monitors the traffic delays based on these predictions, and searches the best reroutes upstream of the meter fixes based on the predictions and estimated arrival schedules when delays are over a predefined threshold. Initial implementation and evaluation of the ORC concept considered only reroutes {{available at the time}} arrival congestion was first predicted. This work extends previous work by introducing an additional dimension in reroute options such that ORC can find the best time to reroute and overcome the 'firstcome- first-reroute' phenomenon. To deal with the enlarged reroute solution space, a genetic algorithm was developed to solve this problem. Experiments were conducted using the same traffic scenario used in previous work, when an arrival rush was created for one of the four arrival meter fixes at George Bush <b>Intercontinental</b> Houston <b>Airport.</b> Results showed the new approach further improved delay savings. The suggested route changes from the new approach were on average 30 minutes later than those using other approaches, and fewer numbers of reroutes were required. Fewer numbers of reroutes reduce operational complexity and later reroutes help decision makers deal with uncertain situations...|$|R

40|$|Airports are {{intermodal}} interfaces between landside and airside traffic. The accompanied {{infrastructure is}} planned for target capacity and the expected use inside the (air) transport sector (e. g. <b>intercontinental</b> hub, feeder <b>airport,</b> secondary hub). It cannot easily be adapted to react on increasing demand when exceeding its capacity. Additionally, in densely populated areas, land needed for expansion is very rare, which leads to developments of new technologies and optimizations {{to cope with the}} increasing demand. This paper presents an approach to evaluate the effect of technologies increasing the airport capacity regarding to the runway capacity. In this context, a standardized airport model is developed and implemented. Furthermore, the traffic structure including arrival/departure rates and traffic mix (heavy, medium, and light aircraft) as well as runway infrastructure are analyzed to reflect different characteristics of the operational airport environment. This standardized approach allows a reliable benchmark of different runway capacities and overcome the long lasting argumentation of non-comparability based on specific airport characteristics. Finally, this paper provides a fundamental concept as an essential element of a capacity development roadmap using both current and future technologies/procedures. The first results concerning a standardized airport as representative for all single runway airports show high conformity for the scenario examined...|$|R
