5|$|The {{climate of}} Adams {{gives it a}} large amount of {{diversity}} within its forests. On the west side, down in the lower valleys, grand fir and Douglas fir dominate the forest with Western hemlock and Western red cedar as well. On the east side, Douglas fir and ponderosa pine are dominant with some patches of dense lodgepole pine. Western hemlock and Western red cedar also occur, but are limited to creek and river bottoms. Grand fir is present on sites with better moisture retention. At middle elevations on the west side, grand fir is increasingly replaced by Pacific silver fir and noble fir; and on the east side, lodgepole becomes much more prevalent. Above a certain elevation, lodgepole pine also appears in areas on the west side as well. As elevation increases further, the forest changes again with subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, and mountain hemlock becoming the dominant tree species on all sides of the mountain. Eventually, the last trees to disappear from the mountainside are the highly cold tolerant whitebark pine and mountain hemlock. Other conifers, 18 species <b>in</b> <b>all,</b> <b>that</b> play a lesser role than the dominant species are Western white pine, Sitka spruce, Western larch, Pacific yew, Alaska cedar, and mountain juniper. Adams is also home to many hardwoods as well including the tree species big leaf maple, Oregon white oak, quaking aspen, black cottonwood, and red alder. Large shrubs/small trees include the dwarf birch, Suksdorf’s hawthorn, California hazelnut, bitter cherry, vine maple, Douglas maple, and blue elderberry and contribute to a vibrant fall display.|$|E

25|$|Craig's and Stanislavski's {{interpretations of}} {{the central role of}} Shakespeare's play, however, were quite different. Stanislavski's vision of Hamlet was as an active, {{energetic}} and crusading character, whereas Craig saw him as a representation of a spiritual principle, caught in a mutually destructive struggle with the principle of matter as embodied <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> surrounded him. Hamlet's tragedy, Craig felt, was that he talks rather than acts.|$|E

25|$|Craig wanted stylized abstraction, while Stanislavski wanted {{psychological}} motivation.

25|$|Drake {{moved to}} Arsenal in March 1934 for £6,500, and scored on his league debut against Wolves on 24 March 1934, in a 3–2 win. Although he joined {{too late to}} qualify for a League Championship medal in 1933–34, Drake would win one in 1934–35, scoring 42 goals in 41 league games in the process – this {{included}} three hat-tricks and four four-goal hauls. With two more goals in the FA Cup and Charity Shield, Drake scored 44 <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> season, breaking Jack Lambert's club record, one that still holds to this day.|$|E

25|$|Spencer {{made his}} debut against Oxford University {{late in the}} 1957 season, scoring 16 in his only innings, {{but it was not}} until the {{following}} season that he played again. He then played no cricket of note until in 1959 he was again selected against Oxford University; he then appeared five more times in the second half of August. <b>In</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> season he made 291 runs at 29.60 and hitting two half-centuries, the higher of these being the 81 he made against Lancashire at Southport.|$|E
25|$|Thompson {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for Barbados in the 1994–95 Red Stripe Cup, and performed well, taking six wickets {{in the game}} – his first being that of Jamaica's opening batsman and Test player Robert Samuels. He took ten wickets <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> season at 27.20, and in the following year's Red Stripe Cup he claimed 23 wickets, the fourth highest of any bowler that year, at 22.34. As a result, {{at the end of}} the West Indian season in April, Thompson was picked for the first Test against New Zealand at his home ground of Bridgetown.|$|E

This prison ceased operating sometime in the 1980s. Another abandoned landmark is the mansion located {{on the corner of}} Rosas Moreno and Antonio Caso, which used to be the Russian embassy. In the 1980s, it was abandoned then suffered a fire. Today it is a shell with much of its roof caved <b>in.</b> <b>All</b> <b>that</b> remains intact is the pink stone decorative features on its facade.|$|E

25|$|Compton {{also played}} football, {{beginning}} {{his career at}} non-league Nunhead during the 1934–35 season before joining Arsenal. Whilst playing as a winger, he made his debut in 1936, taking up the number 11 jersey at the club. Compton was eventually successful at Highbury, winning the League title in 1948 and the FA Cup in 1950. With Arsenal Compton also won the old First Division in 1937–38, making seven league appearances <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> season. However, {{the latter part of}} his sporting career was dogged by knee trouble when his right knee was damaged in a collision with the goalkeeper of club Charlton Athletic. He was thus limited to 60 official i.e. non-wartime appearances, scoring 16 goals altogether. He represented England in wartime games on 12 occasions, but never in a full official match.|$|E
25|$|Their {{friendship}} {{was also}} a working partnership; <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> Alexander undertook, Hephaestion was at his side. They worked well together; {{it is possible to}} discern a pattern, when studying Hephaestion's career, of Alexander's constant trust in, and increasing reliance on, Hephaestion. By the time of the advance into India, after the deaths of senior generals from the older generation, there had been worrying instances among senior officers of their own generation of treachery, a lack of sympathy with Alexander's aims of further integration of Persians into the army, and of sheer incompetence. Time after time, when Alexander needed to divide his forces he entrusted half to Hephaestion, knowing that in him he had a man of unquestionable loyalty who understood and sympathized with his aims and, above all, who got the job done.|$|E
25|$|In Should Old Acquaintance Be Forgot?, Naomi {{is still}} rocking her party-planning {{internship}} under Rachel’s guidance. Her relationship with Austin has ended after Austin allegedly cheated on her with Holly. Austin says Holly snuck in and attacked him {{right after he}} came out of the shower but Naomi refuses to listen to him. Naomi has been so hard at work that her boss, Holly’s mother, gives Naomi the responsibility of hosting her very own event, which is the debutant ball. During the ball, Naomi has rebound sex with a stranger in order to get over Austin. After Naomi has been caught in front of the entire party, Rachel fires her. However, Naomi tells her that Rachel's daughter cheated with her boyfriend. Rachel has sympathy and lets it slide but advises Naomi that she has to be a strong woman and deal with her problems. In Mama Can You Hear Me?, Naomi decides to become a ‘New Naomi’ and try to patch things between Holly and her mother. Rachel briefs Naomi about the impending award season. She entrusts Naomi with a very important assignment. Naomi suggests to her boss that maybe Holly can help too. Although Rachel is reluctant, she agrees to go with Naomi’s suggestion, and appoints Holly as Naomi’s new assistant; shocking both Naomi and Holly. Naomi tries to make amends with Holly, by entrusting her with the very important assignment of getting Mitchell Nash from the hotel to the event. At the event, Rachel is really happy with the way Naomi has organized things, while she is waiting intently for Holly to arrive with Mitchell Nash. Holly arrives at the scene and tells them that Mitchell Nash wasn’t staying at the hotel she had gone to. The boss blasts Naomi for entrusting such an important responsibility to Holly, who according to her has always been irresponsible. Holly and Naomi, haul in a completely drunk Nash to the event. He pukes on the red carpet, with the reporters having a field day. Later Holly and her mother are at it, with Holly trying to defend her position <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> transpired. Naomi again tries defending Holly in front of her mother. The whole thing proves counterproductive, with Naomi getting fired. Later, Holly thanks Naomi for all that she did for her and they both decide to become friends.|$|E
