When life events or episodic memories are encoded in the brain, they are in the form of pictures or visual images. They develop amnesia since they can no longer bring these visual images of the past to mind.|$|E

25|$|The data {{obtained}} from the evaporative process is however not without artefacts that form the physical evaporation or ionisation process. A key feature of the evaporation or field ion <b>images</b> <b>is</b> that the data density is highly inhomogeneous, due to the corrugation of the specimen surface at the atomic scale. This corrugation gives rise to strong electric field gradients in the near-tip zone (on the order of an atomic radii or less from the tip), which during ionisation deflects ions away from the electric field normal.|$|E

For that purpose, new image segmentation technique {{based on the}} probability of pixel distribution in the <b>image</b> <b>is</b> proposed. Color <b>image</b> <b>is</b> first divided into R, G, and B channel images. Then, pixel distribution from each of channel <b>image</b> <b>is</b> extracted to select {{to which it is}} similar among the well known probabilistic distribution function- Weibull, Exponential, Beta, Gamma, Normal, and Uniform. We use sum of least square error to measure of the quality how well an <b>image</b> <b>is</b> fitted to distribution. That P. d. f has minimum score in relation to sum of square error is chosen. Next, each <b>image</b> <b>is</b> quantized into 4 gray levels by applying thresholds to the c. d. f of the selected distribution of each channel. Finally, three quantized <b>images</b> <b>are</b> combined into one color image to obtain final segmentation result.
