40|$|Purpose ¿ The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present an {{artificial}} homeostatic system whose parameters are defined by means of an evolutionary process. The objective is to design a more biologically plausible system inspired by <b>homeostatic</b> <b>regulations</b> observed in nature, which is capable of exploring key issues in the context of robot behaviour adaptation and coordination. Design/methodology/approach ¿ The proposed system consists of an artificial endocrine system that coordinates two spatially unconstrained GasNet artificial neural network models, called non-spatial GasNets. Both systems are dedicated to the definition of control actions in autonomous navigation tasks via the use of an artificial hormone and a hormone receptor. A series of experiments are performed in a real and simulated scenario in order to investigate the performance of the system and its robustness to novel environmental conditions and internal sensory disruptions. Findings ¿ The designed system shows to be robust enough to self-adapt to a wider variety of disruptions and novel environments by making full use of its in-built homeostatic mechanisms. The system is also successfully tested on a real robot, indicating the viability of the proposed method for coping with the reality gap, a well-known issue for the evolutionary robotics community. Originality/value ¿ The proposed framework is inspired by the <b>homeostatic</b> <b>regulations</b> and gaseous neuro-modulation that are intrinsic to the human body. The incorporation of an artificial hormone receptor stands for the novelty of this paper. This hormone receptor proves to be vital to control the network's response to the signalling promoted by the presence of the artificial hormone. It is envisaged that the proposed framework is a step forward in the design of a generic model for coordinating many and more complex behaviours in simulated and real robots, employing multiple hormones and potentially coping with further severe disruptions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract To {{maintain}} {{activity in}} a functional range, neurons constantly adjust membrane excitability to chang-ing intra- and extracellular conditions. Such activity-dependent <b>homeostatic</b> <b>regulation</b> (ADHR) {{is critical for}} normal processing {{of the nervous system}} and avoiding pathological conditions. Here, we posed a <b>homeostatic</b> <b>regulation</b> problem for the classical Morris-Lecar (ML) model. The problem was motivated by the phenomenon of the functional recovery of stomatogastric neurons in crustaceans in the absence of neuromodulation. In our study, the regulation of the ionic conductances in the ML model depended on the calcium current or the intracellular calcium concentration. We found an asymptotic solution to the problem under the assumption of slow regulation. The solution provides a full account of the regulation in the case of correlated or anticorrelated changes of the maximal conductances of the calcium and potassium currents. In particular, the solution shows how the target and parameters of the regulation determine which perturbations of the conductances can be compensated by the ADHR. In some cases, the sets of compensated initial perturbations are not convex. On the basis of our analysis we formulated specific questions for subsequent experimental and theoretical studies of ADHR.

40|$|It {{has long}} been known, in large part from animal studies, that the control of brown adipose tissue (BAT) {{thermogenesis}} is insured by the central nervous system, which integrates several stimuli {{in order to control}} BAT activation through the sympathetic nervous system (SNS).

40|$|Synapses act as {{information}} filters by different molecular mechanisms including retrograde messenger that affect neuronal spiking activity. One of the well-known effects of retrograde messenger in presynaptic neurons {{is a change}} of the probability of neurotransmitter release. Hebbian learning describe a strengthening of a synapse between a presynaptic input onto a postsynaptic neuron when both pre- and postsynaptic neurons are coactive. In this work, a theory of <b>homeostatic</b> <b>regulation</b> of neurotransmitter release by retrograde messenger and Hebbian plasticity in neuronal encoding is presented. Encoding efficiency was measured for different synaptic conditions. In order to gain high encoding efficiency, the spiking pattern of a neuron should be dependent on {{the intensity of the}} input and show low levels of noise. In this work, we represent spiking trains as zeros and ones (corresponding to non-spike or spike in a time bin, respectively) as words with length equal to three. Then the frequency of each word (here eight words) is measured using spiking trains. These frequencies are used to measure neuronal efficiency in different conditions and for different parameter values. Results show that neurons that have synapses acting as band-pass filters show the highest efficiency to encode their input when both Hebbian mechanism and <b>homeostatic</b> <b>regulation</b> of neurotransmitter release exist in synapses. Specifically, the integration of <b>homeostatic</b> <b>regulation</b> of feedback inhibition with Hebbian mechanism and <b>homeostatic</b> <b>regulation</b> of neurotransmitter release in the synapses leads to even higher efficiency when high stimulus intensity is presented to the neurons.

40|$|Intrinsic motivations, {{the topic}} of this paper, can be defined by {{contrasting}} them to extrinsic motivations. Extrinsic motivations are directed to drive and guide the learning of behaviour directed to satisfy <b>homeostatic</b> <b>regulations</b> related to the organisms 2 ̆ 7 survival and repro- duction. Intrinsic motivations, instead, are motivations that serve the evolutionary function of acquiring knowledge (e. g., the capacity to pre- dict) and competence (i. e. the capacity to do) {{in the absence of}} extrinsic motivations: this knowledge and competence can be later exploited for producing behaviours that enhance biological fitness. While knowledge- based intrinsic motivation mechanisms have been widely modelled and studied, competence-based intrinsic motivation mechanisms (CB-IM), usable for guiding learning on the basis of competence level or improve- ment, have been much less investigated. The goal {{of this paper is to}} clarify the nature and possible roles of CB-IM mechanisms for learning, in particular in relation to the cumulative acquisition of a repertoire of skills underlying the capacity to accomplish multiple tasks in the environ- ment, and then to review a specific CB-IM mechanism. This mechanism (TD-CB-IM) measures the improvement rate of competence on the ba- sis of the Temporal-Difference learning signal (TD-error) used in several reinforcement learning (RL) models. The effectiveness of the mechanism is supported by reporting the results of some experiments where the TD- CB-IM mechanism is successfully exploited by a hierarchical RL model controlling a simulated navigating robot to decide when to train different skills in different environmental conditions.

40|$|Along {{with the}} fast genetic improvement, {{nutritional}} and environmental effects on poultry growth performance {{have made it}} necessary to develop growth models that have the flexibility to adapt to different genotypes and growing conditions. A mechanistic simulation model of energy and nutrient utilization in growing turkeys is presented herein. The model consists of simulating the average homeorhetic and <b>homeostatic</b> <b>regulations</b> associated with the utilization of circulating glucose, fatty acid, AA, and acetyl-CoA for protein and lipid retention in carcass, viscera, and feathers in a turkey population. Homeorhesis {{plays a major role}} in the control of protein and lipid turnover for the definition of genetic potential and feed intake, whereas homeostasis adjusts growth rate through protein and lipid turnover rates and, therefore, BW gain and feed intake to the growing conditions. Also, homeostasis enables the maintenance of a dynamic balance state during all the growing period through the control of circulating nutrient concentration. The model was developed and calibrated with experimental data that described energy utilization in male and female growing turkeys. Then, the ability of the model to adapt to genotypes and to predict the average response of a turkey population to dietary energy was evaluated. Model calibration showed simulations of energy and nutrient utilization that fitted well with the experimental data because ME was satisfyingly partitioned into heat production and energy retention as protein and lipid, and nutrient intake accurately partitioned BW gain into carcass, viscera, and feathers. The evaluation of the model was also satisfactory because BW gain and feed-to-gain ratio were globally in accordance with the observations in different male and female genotypes, in spite of an overestimation of the feed-to-gain ratio during the first weeks of age. Model evaluation showed that the BWgain and feed intake response of growing turkeys to dietary energy was accurately predicted. The model can therefore be used in different growing conditions as it is capable of simulating the growth of different turkey genotypes fed under changing environmental and nutritional contexts...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the role of haptoglobin phenotype in realization of adaptive responses of cellular and humoral immunity indices to moderate exercise caused by physical training. The study was implemented in the group of second-year students aged 18 – 20 who lived in the same climatic and geographical conditions for a long period of time. The students didn’t have any acute or chronic diseases and attended the main group of physical training. 60 persons were investigated. Immune system indices analysis was carried out in September before and after physical training lessons. Leukocyte level was calculated using hemocytometer, lymphocyte level was determined on the base of blood smear (dyeing for Romanowsky–Giemsa). Expression of surface antigene by peripheral blood lymphocyte was determined by immuno-fluorescence method with the use of monoclonal antibodies. The level of immunoglobulin in plasma was determined by radial immunodiffusion or Mancini method. To assess the phenotype of haptoglobin (Hp) we used the method of electrophoresis in starch gels. In the course of research we have detected the reduction of the relative and total number of lymphocytes regardless of haptoglobin phenotype in the group of students after physical training; this is a typical feature of the initial stages of stress response. We observed statistically reliable decrease in total number of analyzed subpopulations of T-lymphocyte in the group of students with phenotype Hp 2 - 2 which was obviously the result of changes in the general level of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. In the group of students with phenotype Hp 1 - 1 absolute number of T-lymphocyte with phenotype CD 3 + and CD 4 + is reduced. In the group of students with phenotype Hp 2 - 1 we have seen only the tendency to decrease in functional mature T-lymphocyte and their helper subpopulation. In the group of students with phenotype Hp 2 - 2 the relative number of helper T-lymphocyte with the phenotype of CD 4 + was reduced after moderate physical activity and it caused the decline in immune regulating index CD 4 +/CD 8 +. Changes of the level of B-lymphocyte with CD 72 + phenotype were not found regardless of the haptoglobin phenotype. Analysis of the impact of moderate physical activity on major classes of serum immunoglobulin revealed the reduction of IgG level in the group of students with phenotype Hp 2 - 2. Thus, we draw the conclusion that serum haptoglobin system shares the adaptive reactions of immune system to moderate physical activity. The most pressing phenotype is Hp 2 - 2. Even in the group of students with immune pressing haptoglobin phenotypes, the analyzed parameters do not go beyond the <b>homeostatic</b> <b>regulations</b> after physical activity and it indicates satisfactory level of immune system adaptation to performed physical activity...|$|E

We have worked to refine and apply our multistage carcinogenesis models to explicitly incorporate cell cycle states, simple and complex damage, checkpoint delay, slow and fast repair, differentiation, and apoptosis to {{study the effects of}} low-dose ionizing radiation in mouse intestinal crypts, as well as in other tissues. We have one paper accepted for publication in ''Advances in Space Research'', and another manuscript in preparation describing this work. I also wrote a chapter describing our combined cell-cycle and multistage carcinogenesis model that will be published in a book on stochastic carcinogenesis models edited by Wei-Yuan Tan. In addition, we organized and held a workshop on ''Biologically Based Modeling of Human Health Effects of Low dose Ionizing Radiation'', July 28 - 29, 2005 at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington. We had over 20 participants, including Mary Helen Barcellos-Hoff as keynote speaker, talks by most of the low-dose modelers in the DOE low-dose program, experimentalists including Les Redpath (and Mary Helen), Noelle Metting from DOE, and Tony Brooks. It appears that <b>homeostatic</b> <b>regulation</b> may be central to understanding low-dose radiation phenomena. The primary effects of ionizing radiation (IR) are cell killing, delayed cell cycling, and induction of mutations. However, <b>homeostatic</b> <b>regulation</b> causes cells that are killed or damaged by IR to eventually be replaced. Cells with an initiating mutation may have a replacement advantage, leading to clonal expansion of these initiated cells. Thus we have focused particularly on modeling effects that disturb <b>homeostatic</b> <b>regulation</b> as early steps in the carcinogenic process. There are two primary considerations that support our focus on <b>homeostatic</b> <b>regulation.</b> First, a number of epidemiologic studies using multistage carcinogenesis models that incorporate the ''initiation, promotion, and malignant conversion'' paradigm of carcinogenesis are indicating that promotion of initiated cells is the most important cellular mechanism driving the shape of the age specific hazard for many types of cancer.

40|$|Metabolic {{engineering}} – {{the improvement}} and addition, by genetic modification, of industrially relevant properties of microorganisms {{with respect to}} catalysis, transport and regulatory functions – is a well-established method for development of more cost-effective and ‘green’ industrial processes. Rapid depletion of oil reserves and a growing demand for sustainable, environmentally friendly processes provide incentives for efficient exploitation of new, renewable resources {{for the production of}} transport fuels and bulk chemicals. The narrow profit margins that are typical for such commodity products, impose a need to optimize processes in terms of kinetics of product formation and, especially, yield of product on feedstock. Metabolic engineering of microorganisms, with its continuously expanding toolbox, allows researchers to address the challenges involved in the development of biotechnological processes that can compete with petrochemical production. Due to its robustness in industrial fermentation processes and fast developments in yeast synthetic biology, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (a. k. a. baker’s yeast) {{has become one of the}} most popular metabolic engineering platforms in modern biotechnology. As a result, this microorganism, after having been used for ages in the production of alcoholic beverages and bread, is now recognized as multi-purpose microbial ‘workhorse’ with numerous industrial applications. Production of many natural and heterologous compounds with genetically modified strains of S. cerevisiae is under investigation or has already been implemented in industry. Many of those biochemicals, for example n-butanol, isoprenoids, lipids, flavonoids and 3 -hydroxypropionic acid, require acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) as a key precursor. The metabolism of this compound in S. cerevisiae cells is compartmentalised. The mitochondrial route, responsible for a substantial flux towards acetyl-CoA during respiratory growth on sugars, involves conversion of mitochondrial pyruvate into acetyl-CoA in the reaction catalysed by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Since, in S. cerevisiae, acetyl-CoA cannot be exported from the mitochondria, another pathway is required to cover biosynthetic requirements for acetyl-CoA in the cytosolic compartment. This so-called ‘pyruvate dehydrogenase bypass’ requires the concerted activity of pyruvate decarboxylase, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase and acetyl-CoA synthetase. The latter two reactions are also required for growth on the C 2 -compounds – acetate (only acetyl-CoA synthetase) and ethanol. When ethanol is used as a carbon source, it is first converted to acetaldehyde in the reaction catalysed by alcohol dehydrogenases and further to acetyl-CoA, which is used to cover all biosynthetic and energetic requirements of ethanol-grown cells. Heterologous, acetyl-CoA-dependent product pathways expressed in the cytosol of S. cerevisiae exclusively depend on the cytosolic route for provision of this precursor. As a result, several previous metabolic engineering studies have been devoted to improving the synthesis of the cytosolic acetyl-CoA. Although successful in increasing the availability of this compound, by improving the capacity of the native route or by introduction of the heterologous pathways of cytosolic acetyl-CoA synthesis, those studies primarily focused on the kinetic parameters, while the energetic aspects of cytosolic acetyl-CoA synthesis received little attention. The maximum yield of biomass or of any other industrially relevant product on a substrate depends on the energy (ATP) cost of the biochemical pathways used for precursor and product formation. The synthesis of cytosolic acetyl-CoA in S. cerevisiae involves hydrolysis of ATP to AMP and pyrophosphate (PP i) in the reaction catalysed by acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS). The subsequent hydrolysis of PP i to inorganic phosphate (P i) makes the energetic cost of cytosolic acetyl-CoA synthesis equivalent to hydrolysis of 2 ATP to 2 ADP and 2 P i. This ATP expenditure has a profound impact on the maximum yields of acetyl-CoA-dependent products that can be achieved in engineered yeast strains and, therefore, negatively influences the economy of the production process. Especially in the case of bulk chemicals and bio-fuels, this single ATP-consuming reaction can become cost-prohibitive. This thesis explores metabolic engineering strategies to address this key challenge in yeast biotechnology. After general introduction to metabolic engineering and S. cerevisiae, Chapter 1 describes the strategies that have hitherto been explored to increase the availability of cytosolic acetyl-CoA. Moreover, this Chapter discusses other pathways of cytosolic acetyl-CoA synthesis that occur in nature, some of which do not require an input of ATP and could therefore, upon expression in S. cerevisiae, lead to increase of maximum yields of acetyl-CoA-dependent products on substrate in engineered yeast strains. In S. cerevisiae, cytosolic acetyl-CoA synthesis and growth strictly depend on functional expression of either the Acs 1 or Acs 2 isoenzyme of acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS). Before the research described in this thesis, viable S. cerevisiae strains in which both ACS 1 and ACS 2 had been deleted, had not been described in the literature. In addition to its anabolic and, under certain conditions, catabolic roles, cytosolic acetyl-CoA also plays key role in cellular regulation via acetylation of proteins, including histones. Chapter 2 explores the feasibility of replacing the native S. cerevisiae pathway for cytosolic acetyl-CoA synthesis by two alternative, ATP-independent pathways, and investigates their impact on growth and energetics of the engineered yeast strains. To this end, the native route of cytosolic acetyl-CoA synthesis was replaced by either an acetylating acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (A-ALD) or a pyruvate-formate lyase (PFL). Acetylating acetaldehyde dehydrogenase catalyses direct, ATP-independent oxidation of acetaldehyde to acetyl-CoA, while pyruvate-formate lyase converts cytosolic pyruvate into equimolar amounts of acetyl-CoA and formate. After evaluating the expression of different genes encoding acetylating acetaldehyde dehydrogenase and pyruvate-formate lyase, acs 1 ? acs 2 ? S. cerevisiae strains were constructed in which A-ALD or PFL functionally replaced ACS. In case of the A-ALD-dependent strains, also all acetaldehyde dehydrogenases were deleted, which resulted in complete replacement of the two-step conversion of acetaldehyde to acetyl-CoA, by a one-step reaction catalysed by A-ALD. The A-ALD-dependent strains showed aerobic growth rates of up to 79 % of the reference strain, while anaerobic growth rates of PFL-dependent S. cerevisiae reached up to 73 % of the growth rate of the reference strain. Physiological characterisation of the fastest growing A-ALD- and PFL-dependent strains was performed in glucose-limited chemostat cultures. Unexpectedly, the measured biomass yields on glucose of A-ALD- and PFL-dependent strains were 14 % and 15 % lower than those of the reference strain, respectively. Weak-acid uncoupling by formate, the formation of which was stoichiometrically coupled to growth of PFL-dependent strain, offers a plausible explanation for the reduced biomass yield of this strain. In A-ALD-dependent strain, the reduced biomass yield of the A-ALD-dependent strain was attributed to toxic effects of the acetaldehyde, which was present at higher levels in cultures of the engineered strain than in cultures of the reference strain. Changes in the synthesis of cytosolic acetyl-CoA might affect histone acetylation as well as central metabolism via acetylation of non-histone proteins and direct participation of this compound in key reactions. However, transcriptome analysis of A-ALD- and PFL-dependent strains revealed only small sets of genes with altered expression levels relative to the reference strain. Combined with their high growth rates, these observations suggested that these strains did not suffer from major limitations in acetyl-CoA provision. This conclusion was further supported by the minor differences in intracellular metabolite levels of an A-ALD-dependent strain relative to the control strain. Intracellular acetyl-CoA concentrations, which reflect the combination of mitochondrial and nucleocytosolic pools, were also not significantly different between A-ALD-dependent strain and the reference strain, which may suggest that intracellular concentrations of acetyl-CoA are subject to strong <b>homeostatic</b> <b>regulations.</b> Higher intracellular lysine concentrations in A-ALD-dependent strain might even be indicative for increased availability of cytosolic acetyl-CoA. The research presented in Chapter 2 demonstrated, for the first time, that the native pathway for cytosolic acetyl-CoA synthesis in S. cerevisiae can be entirely replaced by heterologous, ATP-independent pathways. During respiratory growth of S. cerevisiae on glucose, cytosolic acetyl-CoA is required to cover biosynthetic requirements of the cell, including the biosynthesis of lysine and of lipids. However, these biosynthetic fluxes are relatively small compared to the overall rate of ATP turnover and, therefore, have a relatively small impact on growth energetics (calculated impact on biomass yield in aerobic, glucose-limited cultures < 0. 5 %). A fundamentally different situation arises when ethanol is used as a carbon source and acetyl-CoA synthetase is the starting point for all biosynthetic and dissimilatory pathways in growing yeast cells. Under these conditions, saving of the 2 ATP required for synthesis of each molecule of cytosolic acetyl-CoA, should theoretically enable an increase of the biomass yield from 0. 57 g/g ethanol for the native route up to 0. 80 g/g ethanol for an ATP-independent pathway. Such a dramatic increase in the energetic efficiency of ethanol utilization could be highly relevant for industry, as it should result in higher yield on ethanol of any acetyl-CoA-dependent product. Therefore, Chapter 3 focuses on yeast strains in which the native pathway for acetyl-CoA synthesis was replaced by A-ALD. The A-ALD-dependent strains, however, did not show immediate growth on media with ethanol as the sole carbon source. Prolonged incubation, followed by long-term laboratory evolution experiments, yielded A-ALD-dependent yeast strains that were able to grow on ethanol with specific growth rates up to 0. 11 h ? 1. Reverse engineering studies showed that mutations in ACS 1, the gene that encodes one of the S. cerevisiae cytosolic acetyl-CoA synthetases, were essential for growth on ethanol of the A-ALD-dependent strains. Acquired mutations in A-ALD genes improved V MAX /K M for acetaldehyde of the encoded enzymes, but were not essential for growth on ethanol. Although the reverse engineered strains grew on ethanol, their growth rates were lower than the growth rates of the evolved strains. Further analysis of the growth of these strains suggested a limited availability of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA during growth of the A-ALD-dependent strains on ethanol. Out of five evolved strains tested in ethanol-limited chemostat cultures, only one evolved strain showed a 5 % increase in the biomass yield on ethanol compared to the reference strain, which was far below the 40 % theoretical prediction. Increased production of acetaldehyde and other byproducts was identified as possible cause for these suboptimal biomass yields. This study in Chapter 3 proves that the native yeast pathway for conversion of ethanol to acetyl-CoA can be replaced by an engineered pathway that has the potential to strongly improve biomass and product yields. Based on metabolic and evolutionary engineering, whole-genome resequencing, reverse engineering and physiological analysis of evolved strains, we identify intracellular acetaldehyde levels and provision of intramitochondrial acetyl-CoA as key targets for further optimization of ethanol conversion by eukaryotic cell factories. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is a huge, multisubunit enzyme complex whose size is comparable to that of a ribosome. The PDH complex catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA which, in many organisms, is the key reaction at the interface of glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). In eukaryotes, the PDH complex occurs exclusively in the mitochondrial matrix and, therefore, cannot contribute to provision of cytosolic acetyl-CoA in S. cerevisiae. In Chapter 4, the challenge of the expression of a functional, heterologous PDH complex in the yeast cytosol is taken up. In order to determine if a heterologous PDH complex can replace the native route of cytosolic acetyl-CoA formation in S. cerevisiae, the PDH complex from the bacterium Enteroccocus faecalis was selected to be expressed in yeast. Three factors contributed to selecting the PDH complex from E. faecalis for this study: (i) bacterial PDH subunits presumably lack mitochondrial localization sequences; (ii) E. faecalis PDH is relatively insensitive to high NADH/NAD + ratios in comparison to other bacterial PDH’s; and (iii) in vitro experiments indicate that purified subunits of the E. faecalis PDH can self-assemble into a functional complex. All known PDH complexes require four cofactors for their activity: FAD +, NAD +, thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) and lipoic acid. In S. cerevisiae, lipoic acid is synthesized and covalently attached to the PDH complex in the mitochondria. Therefore, cytosolic expression of a bacterial PDH complex was likely to require co-expression of proteins that catalyze lipoylation of PDH, as well as addition of lipoate to the media. The expression of genes encoding the four subunits of the E. faecalis PDH complex, together with two lipoate ligases from E. faecalis in the cytosol of S. cerevisiae, combined with deletion of ACS 1 and ACS 2, enabled growth of an acs 1 ? acs 2 ? strain of S. cerevisiae on glucose. The strict dependency of growth on the addition of lipoic acid confirmed the in vivo activity of the heterologous PDH complex. The aerobic growth rate on glucose of the obtained strain (0. 36 h ? 1) was comparable to the growth rate of the reference strain (0. 42 h ? 1) and independent of the concentration of lipoic acid in the range of 20 ng mL ? 1 to 1000 ng mL ? 1. The Acs ? yeast strain expressing the bacterial PDH complex also showed a near-wild-type growth rate under anaerobic conditions (0. 30 h ? 1 and 0. 33 h ? 1 for engineered and wild-type strain, respectively). Functioning of the E. faecalis PDH complex in anaerobic yeast cultures indicates that it can also be applied in the design and construction of anaerobic product pathways. Enzyme activity assays indicated that, in an engineered strain, PDH from E. faecalis yielded higher specific activity (53 nmol min ? 1 mg protein ? 1) than the activity of the mitochondrial PDH of S. cerevisiae (12 nmol min ? 1 mg protein ? 1). The cytosolic localization of the heterologously expressed E. faecalis PDH complex in the yeast cytosol was confirmed by subcellular fractionation, combined with enzyme activity assay and mass-spectrometry-based proteomics. While the specific activities of the PDH in the mitochondrial fractions of engineered strain and the wild-type strain were not significantly different, the specific activity of PDH measured in the cytosolic fraction of Acs ? strain expressing PDH of E. faecalis was 32 -fold higher than that of the wild-type strain. The cytosolic localization of the four subunits of the E. faecalis PDH complex, as well as of the two lipoate ligases of E. faecalis in the cytosol of S. cerevisiae was further confirmed by mass spectrometry-based proteome analysis of the cytosolic fraction. In E. faecalis, PDH occurs as a protein complex consisting of 210 subunits. Gel filtration of a cytosolic fraction, combined with enzyme activity measurements and proteomics analysis, demonstrated that E. faecalis PDH was present in the cytosol of S. cerevisiae as a complex with a size, a specific activity, and a relative abundance of the E 1, E 2, and E 3 subunits comparable to those reported for native E. faecalis PDH. Chemostat-based physiological characterization in glucose-limited chemostat cultures showed comparable biomass yields and rates of sugar dissimilation for the Acs ? strain expressing PDH and a reference strain. These results, together with the absence of strong differences in the transcriptome of engineered and native strains, indicated that replacement of the cytosolic acetyl-CoA synthesis with PDH complex from E. faecalis did not lead to significant disturbances of the physiology of S. cerevisiae. The research described in this thesis demonstrates that complete replacement of the native route of cytosolic acetyl-CoA formation in S. cerevisiae with heterologous ATP-independent pathways can result in viable yeast strains. Moreover, it delivers proof of concept that implementation of the ATP-independent pathways may result in increased biomass yield on substrate. These strategies appear to be particularly suited for improving the product yield on sugar of any compound, produced in S. cerevisiae, that uses cytosolic acetyl-CoA as a precursor. Therefore, the results presented in this thesis provide metabolic engineers with new strategies to optimize the performance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a ‘cell factory’ for sustainable production of fuels and chemicals.
