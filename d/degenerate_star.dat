5|$|TY Coronae Borealis is a {{pulsating}} {{white dwarf}} (of ZZ Ceti) type, which is around 70% as massive as the Sun, yet has only 1.1% of its diameter. Discovered in 1990, UW Coronae Borealis is a low-mass X-ray binary system {{composed of a}} star less massive than the Sun and a neutron star surrounded by an accretion disk that draws material from the companion star. It varies in brightness in an unusually complex manner: the two stars orbit each other every 111 minutes, yet there is another cycle of 112.6 minutes, which corresponds to the orbit of the disk around the <b>degenerate</b> <b>star.</b> The beat period of 5.5 days indicates the time the accretion disk—which is asymmetrical—takes to precess around the star.|$|E
5|$|Theoretical studies {{indicate}} that most supernovae are triggered by one of two basic mechanisms: the sudden re-ignition of nuclear fusion in a <b>degenerate</b> <b>star</b> or the sudden gravitational collapse of a massive star's core. In the first instance, a degenerate white dwarf may accumulate sufficient material from a binary companion, either through accretion or via a merger, to raise its core temperature enough to trigger runaway nuclear fusion, completely disrupting the star. In the second case, {{the core of a}} massive star may undergo sudden gravitational collapse, releasing gravitational potential energy as a supernova. While some observed supernovae are more complex than these two simplified theories, the astrophysical collapse mechanics have been established and accepted by most astronomers for some time.|$|E
25|$|Gamma Cassiopeiae is the {{prototype}} Gamma Cassiopeiae variable star, {{a type of}} variable star that has a variable disc of material flung off by the high rotation rate of the star. Gamma Cassiopeiae has a minimum magnitude of 3.0 and a maximum magnitude of 1.6, but is generally near magnitude 2.2, with unpredictable fades and brightenings. It is a spectroscopic binary, with an orbital period of 203.59 days and a companion with a calculated mass {{about the same as}} the Sun. However, no direct evidence of this companion has been found, leading to speculation that it might be a white dwarf or other <b>degenerate</b> <b>star.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Under {{extremely}} high pressure, {{as in the}} cores of dead stars, ordinary matter undergoes a transition {{to a series of}} exotic states of matter collectively known as degenerate matter, which are supported mainly by quantum mechanical effects. In physics, [...] "degenerate" [...] refers to two states that have the same energy and are thus interchangeable. Degenerate matter is supported by the Pauli exclusion principle, which prevents two fermionic particles from occupying the same quantum state. Unlike regular plasma, degenerate plasma expands little when heated, because there are simply no momentum states left. Consequently, <b>degenerate</b> <b>stars</b> collapse into very high densities. More massive <b>degenerate</b> <b>stars</b> are smaller, because the gravitational force increases, but pressure does not increase proportionally.|$|R

2500|$|Early {{theories}} {{concerning the}} nature of the lowest-mass stars and the hydrogen-burning limit suggested that a population I object with a mass less than 0.07 solar masses (...) or a population II object less than [...] would never go through normal stellar evolution and would become a completely <b>degenerate</b> <b>star.</b> The first self-consistent calculation of the hydrogen-burning minimum mass confirmed a value between 0.08 and 0.07 solar masses for population I objects. The discovery of deuterium burning down to 0.012solar masses and the impact of dust formation in the cool outer atmospheres of brown dwarfs in the late 1980s brought these theories into question. However, such objects were hard to find as they emit almost no visible light. Their strongest emissions are in the infrared (IR) spectrum, and ground-based IR detectors were too imprecise at that time to readily identify any brown dwarfs.|$|E

40|$|The {{emerging}} monochromatic fluxes and the B-V, V-I, J-H, and V-K color {{indices are}} presented for red <b>degenerate</b> <b>stars</b> with helium atmospheres which were calculated using an {{equation of state}} and opacities based on a hot Thomas-Fermi model of the helium gas. The effective temperature range is 4500 - 2500 K. It is found that although the emerging fluxes resemble blackbody curves, red degenerates emit more radiation than blackbodies in the short wavelength range and less in the long wavelength range. Thus, red degenerates appear bluer than blackbodies of the same temperature. The calculated colors of these models are compared to the colors {{of some of the}} coolest known non-DA <b>degenerate</b> <b>stars.</b> In particular it is found that the B-V and V-I colors of the cool white dwarf VB 11, whose temperature had been previously estimated to be higher than 4000 K, suggest a temperature of 3750 K.
