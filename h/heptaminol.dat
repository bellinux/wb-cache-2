Since the team was a member of the Mouvement pour un cyclisme crédible union, a second positive test meant that, according to the union's regulations, they had to stop racing for eight days.

50|$|Russian {{sprinter}} and 2004 Olympics {{road race}} bronze medallist, Olga Slyusareva, {{was able to}} win three of the ten sprints, and place in four other sprints to achieve 20 points. The peloton was {{able to respond to}} any breakaways so no riders were able to achieve lap points. Mexican rider Belem Guerrero Méndez with 14 points was awarded the silver medal, closely followed by Maria Luisa Calle Williams from Colombia on 12 points. Calle Williams later tested positive for banned stimulant <b>heptaminol,</b> and Erin Mirabella was promoted to the bronze medal position. That decision, however, was later reversed on appeal. It was proven Calle never ingested <b>heptaminol,</b> but a headache drug called Neosaldina, which contains a substance that will transform into <b>heptaminol</b> during laboratory analysis. As a result of the IOC's October 24, 2005 decision, Mirabella was ordered to return the bronze medal and diploma and Calle's third-place result, bronze medal and diploma were re-instated.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that <b>heptaminol</b> and methylheptaminol should be used as myocardial stimulants because they have cardiotonic actions similar to those of cardiac glycosides. However, as these aliphatic amines show definite sympathomimetic effects, the mechanism of their actions on the heart was investigated, in order to determine whether digitalis-like properties are involved in these effects. The pattern of pharmacological actions of <b>heptaminol</b> and methylheptaminol was compared with that of catechol amines, tyramine and k-strophanthin. The influence of atropine, hexamethonium, cocaine and reserpine was also investigated. The results show that both heptanolamines have a long-lasting cardiostimulant action which is abolished by cocaine and absent in reserpine pretreated animals. The pharmacological activity of these drugs may be entirely attributed to an indirect sympathomimetic action of the tyramine type, probably due to release of endogenous catechol amines. None of the experimental findings is consistent with the alleged digitalis-like action of these compounds...|$|E

"July 2012 "[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] A series of novel fluorescent sensors were designed and synthesized to detect lipids and hydrophobic amines in aqueous solutions. The closed allyl molecular tubes had fairly high affinity and selectivity towards lipids with fluorescence enhancements, but difficult synthesis was the limitation for further modifications to apply different targets. The carbazole open tube with easier synthesis and higher yield only bound hydrophobic amines including stimulants such as 2 -aminoheptane, methylhexanamine, <b>heptaminol,</b> phenylethylamine, pseudoephedrine, driven by both hydrophobic effect and electrostatic interactions. The unexpected cyclic open tube selectively bound polyamines such as spermine and spermidine with fluorescence decreases. The binding mechanism of the cyclic open tube toward long chained alkylamines was not yet fully understood. The designed glycolipid sensors proved to be very acid sensitive, therefore base labile protecting groups for amine intermediates should be used.
