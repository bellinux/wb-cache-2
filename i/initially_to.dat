5|$|After {{ten weeks}} being {{constantly}} watched to prevent suicide attempts in police custody, he {{was transferred to}} Akershus Fortress and awaited trial {{as part of the}} legal purge. Despite initially losing weight and suffering from polyneuritis, his strong constitution meant that he soon started working hard on his case with Henrik Bergh, a lawyer with a good track record but largely unsympathetic, at least <b>initially,</b> <b>to</b> Quisling's plight. Bergh did, however, believe Quisling's testimony that he tried to act {{in the best interests of}} Norway and decided to use this as a starting point for the defence.|$|E

5|$|Burnside {{was ordered}} to take the IX Corps back to the Eastern Theater, where he built {{it up to a}} {{strength}} of over 21,000 in Annapolis, Maryland. The IX Corps fought in the Overland Campaign of May 1864 as an independent command, reporting <b>initially</b> <b>to</b> Grant; his corps was not assigned to the Army of the Potomac because Burnside outranked its commander Maj. Gen. George G. Meade, who had been a division commander under Burnside at Fredericksburg. This cumbersome arrangement was rectified on May 24 just before the Battle of North Anna, when Burnside agreed to waive his precedence of rank and was placed under Meade's direct command.|$|E

After four months and 24 matches, during which the team won just twice and dropped to 20th place, three points outside the relegation zone with three matches remaining, Zola resigned, {{to be replaced by}} Harry Redknapp, <b>initially</b> <b>to</b> the end of the season.|$|E
5|$|Ford's {{first step}} into {{organised}} team football came with local Swansea based side Tower United, joining the club {{at the age}} of 15 as a full-back. Despite his young age, he played for the senior men's side in local amateur leagues where he attracted scouts from several clubs. The scouts included Albert Lindon of Arsenal, who invited Ford and teammate Frank Davies to attend a trial in Cardiff. Ford impressed enough to be offered an amateur contract with the London-based side, which was <b>initially</b> <b>to</b> be withheld until the end of hostilities in the Second World War. However, Ford himself rejected the contract as he felt he was too young too move away from his home and family.|$|E

5|$|Lord Anglesey {{became the}} captain of Cowes Castle in 1826, by now a sinecure rather than a regular {{military}} appointment, and spent part of each year at the castle, making further, lavish improvements to the interiors. Anglesey was {{also a member of}} the Royal Yacht Squadron, first established in 1815, which then operated from the Gloster Hotel in Cowes. By this time yachting had become a prestigious local event; the painter J. M. W. Turner sketched the yachts sailing off the castle when he visited in 1827. When Anglesey died in 1854 the government decommissioned the castle and leased the property <b>initially</b> <b>to</b> Anglesey's son-in-law Lord Conyngham, and then to the Squadron in 1855.|$|E
5|$|On February2, Groundhog Day, a {{disturbance}} was first {{observed in the}} western Caribbean Sea. Winds were estimated at around 35mph (55km/h), and it tracked rapidly northward, <b>initially</b> <b>to</b> the north-northwest. After passing near Cancún along the Yucatan Peninsula, it turned northeastward and brushed the northwest coast of Cuba. Early on February3 the storm approached Key West, and shortly thereafter moved ashore near Cape Sable, Florida. It quickly crossed the state, passing near Miami before emerging into the western Atlantic Ocean. The Miami National Weather Service office recorded a wind gust of 68mph (110km/h), as well as sustained tropical storm force winds for about four hours; the station also recorded a barometric pressure of 1004mbar (29.66inHg).|$|E

5|$|On Henry's {{death in}} December 1135, Pain {{attended}} the king's funeral. Pain {{was an early}} supporter of King Stephen, although he was said <b>initially</b> <b>to</b> have been afraid to appear at Stephen's court {{for fear of being}} confronted by those he had oppressed. Nevertheless, Pain was with the new king by early January 1136, when he witnessed one of Stephen's documents, dated to around 4 January 1136, at Reading. By Easter, both Pain and his brother Eustace had formally submitted to the king. Pain witnessed a royal charter at Oxford in April 1136. The king rewarded the brothers by continuing to appoint them to judicial functions, and confirmed grants made by them to various religious houses.|$|E
5|$|Permanent {{settlement}} on Lord Howe {{was established in}} June 1834 when the British whaling barque Caroline, sailing from New Zealand and commanded by Captain John Blinkenthorpe, landed at what {{is now known as}} Blinky Beach. They left three men, George Ashdown, James Bishop and Chapman, who were employed by a Sydney whaling firm to establish a supply station. The men were <b>initially</b> <b>to</b> provide meat by fishing and by raising pigs and goats from feral stock. They landed with (or acquired from a visiting ship) their Māori wives and two Māori boys. Huts were built in an area now known as Old Settlement which had a supply of fresh water, and a garden was established west of Blinky Beach.|$|E

5|$|Spain's loss of Gibraltar {{and other}} Spanish territories in the Mediterranean was resented by the Spanish public and monarchy alike. In 1717 Spanish forces retook Sardinia and in 1718 Sicily, {{both of which}} had been ceded to Austria under the Treaty of Utrecht. The {{effective}} Spanish repudiation of the treaty prompted the British <b>initially</b> <b>to</b> propose handing back Gibraltar in exchange for a peace agreement and, when that failed, to declare war on Spain. The Spanish gains were quickly reversed, a Spanish expedition to Scotland in 1719 supporting the Jacobites was defeated and peace was eventually restored by the Treaty of The Hague.|$|E
5|$|Speer {{placed his}} {{department}} {{at the disposal of}} the Wehrmacht. When Hitler remonstrated, and said it was not for Speer to decide how his workers should be used, Speer simply ignored him. Among Speer's innovations were quick-reaction squads to construct roads or clear away debris; before long, these units would be used to clear bomb sites. As the war progressed, <b>initially</b> <b>to</b> great German success, Speer continued preliminary work on the Berlin and Nürnberg plans. Speer also oversaw the construction of buildings for the Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe.|$|E
5|$|The Monkland Canal was {{constructed}} {{at the end}} of the 18th century <b>initially</b> <b>to</b> transport coal to Glasgow from the rich local deposits. The invention of the hot blast furnace process in 1828 meant that Coatbridge's ironstone deposits could be exploited to the maximum by the canal link and hot blast process. The new advances meant that iron could be produced with two thirds less fuel. Summerlee Iron Works was one of the first iron works to use this technology. By the mid 19th century there were numerous hot blast furnaces in operation in Coatbridge.|$|E
50|$|Britain imposed its own {{national}} sanctions, including an oil embargo, but ruled out invading Rhodesia. The British were <b>initially</b> opposed <b>to</b> military action, instead relying on UN sanctions {{to pressure the}} Rhodesians.
