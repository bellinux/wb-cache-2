Wilson was the {{youngest}} child of Jethro Reuben and Louisa Jane (Round) Wilson, who were both descendents from early English settlers. Growing up, Wilson frequented the local library in Lenoir, the Pioneer Library. His passion for the freedom to read led him to his important promotion of free public library services may have begun in his youth at the Pioneer Library. Wilson later worked on a newspaper, called the Topic, and was also a janitor at the local Methodist church.

The reason for the general interest in circulation systems is obvious. Circulating books, particularly in large libraries, has always been a burdensome operation, but the process has become increasingly so in recent years. Larger enrollments in colleges and universities since the war, increased population, and library consciousness generally, have resulted in a greater number of books being issued. Scarcity of clerical help, higher labor costs, and, to a lesser degree, lower "production " resulting from shorter working hours have added to the woes of circulation departments. To accomplish more work in fewer hours, it was imperative to find more efficient methods of charging and <b>discharging</b> <b>books.</b> Maintenance of professional standards was also a factor in stimulating librarians to search for simpler circulation methods.

40|$|The {{number of}} babies needing {{neonatal}} care is increasing due mainly to technological and therapeutic advances. These advances have implied a decreasing neonatal mortality rate for {{low birth weight}} infants and also a falling incidence of preterm stillbirth. Unfortunately, the neonatal system is facing some challenges, such as the nurse shortage {{and the lack of}} cots that could impact neonates' length-of-stay (LOS), medical conditions, and so on. In this paper, we aim at studying the variability of the neonatal system and its population. We first analyse the length of stay, gestation age and birth weight of babies admitted to an English neonatal hospital. We then perform an analysis of variation of the LOS for each level of care based on variables specific to babies' pathways, i. e. reasons for admission, types of referral, <b>discharge</b> destinations and <b>booked</b> places. Finally, we estimate the pairwise correlations between intensive care unit LOS, high dependency unit LOS and special care unit LOS. Hence, understanding babies characteristics and how long they will stay at each level of care is an important step for an efficient management of the neonatal system...|$|R
