25|$|The outside world, at {{the time}} focused on the wars of the former Yugoslavia, turned its {{attention}} away from the happenings of central Africa. The exception was the international humanitarian aid community and the United Nations, for whom the Great Lakes crisis was an agonizing dilemma that has been the topic of extensive analysis and ethical arguments. As a result, UNHCR reworked its procedures to try to ensure greater <b>international</b> <b>commitment</b> in its interventions.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} for migrant domestic workers in Lebanon is grim, as the circumstances for {{them are not}} improving; the migrant domestic workers {{have been subjected to}} violations of their freedom of movement and their right to residency. In early 2014, the general security began deporting children of migrant workers with one or both of their parents. The justification for this move was that the migrants were in Lebanon to work and not create families, it is worthy to note that the implementation of these deportations had been put on hold after pressure from civil society organisations like Insan. By the summer of 2015, the decision to expel migrant domestic workers and their children had been overturned. However, things did not get better for the migrant domestic workers; they now had to deal with tighter control over residency permits. The general security which is the body legally mandated to deal with foreign workers has refused to re-grant some workers their permits on the grounds of refusing to reside with their employees. Despite the fact that the general security exercises force on migrant domestic workers and their presence in the country, this is in fact in violation with the Lebanese legal <b>international</b> <b>commitment,</b> constitution and national laws.|$|E

40|$|Our study investigates {{why some}} firms engage in low <b>international</b> <b>commitments</b> such as exports {{in the early}} phases of internationalization, whereas others {{leapfrog}} the internationalization process and start with high <b>international</b> <b>commitments</b> {{in the form of}} foreign direct investment (FDI). Process models of internationalization propose that firms start with low commitment activities and gradually increase their <b>commitments</b> to <b>international</b> markets. However, recent empirical evidence has shown that many firms make high <b>international</b> <b>commitments</b> from the start. Our findings suggest that domestic resources and competitive action propensity affect early <b>international</b> <b>commitments</b> indirectly through domestic mindsets. A domestic mindset refers to the knowledge structures of the top management team prior to starting international activities, based on their managerial experience and learning in domestic markets. Our results suggest that knowledge and learning gained in domestic markets through diverse resource and competitive activities may be crucial in early <b>international</b> <b>commitments.</b> Journal of <b>International</b> Business Studies (2007) 38, 160 – 176. doi: 10. 1057 /palgrave. jibs. 8400248...|$|R

2500|$|The [...] "Forest Principles" [...] {{adopted at}} The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 {{captured}} the general international understanding of {{sustainable forest management}} at that time. [...] A number of sets of criteria and indicators have since been developed to evaluate the achievement of SFM at the global, regional, country and management unit level. These were all attempts to codify and provide for independent assessment {{of the degree to}} which the broader objectives of sustainable forest management are being achieved in practice. In 2007, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Non-Legally Binding Instrument on All Types of Forests.

[...] While Ireland has an <b>international</b> <b>commitment</b> to protecting the well-being of women trafficked to Ireland for the purposes of prostitution, there was little or no discussion about the rights and well-being of Irish women working in prostitution. The violent murders of prostitutes Belinda Pereira, a UK resident working for a Dublin escort agency on 28 December 1996 and Sinead Kelly a young street prostitute in 1998 caused questions to be raised about the benefits of the 1993 act. Until Belinda Periera was murdered in a city centre apartment in the winter of 1996, the last murder of a prostitute while working (Dolores Lynch was murdered in her home in 1983, and seems to have no longer been working as a prostitute at the time) was in 1925 when the body of Lily O'Neill (known as [...] "Honor Bright") was found in the Dublin Mountains.|$|E

40|$|Sometimes the United States makes <b>international</b> <b>commitments</b> in {{the manner}} {{set forth in the}} Treaty Clause. But far more often it uses congressional-{{executive}} agreements, sole executive agreements, and soft law commitments. Foreign relations law scholars typically approach these other processes from the perspective of constitutional law, seeking {{to determine the extent to}} which they are constitutionally permissible. In contrast, this Article situates the myriad ways in which the United States enters into <b>international</b> <b>commitments</b> as the product not only of constitutional law, but also of international law and administrative law. Drawing on all three strands of law provides a rich understanding of the various processes for making <b>international</b> <b>commitments</b> and of the circumstances under which a particular process will be used. This approach also has important implications for separation-of-powers concerns. From a constitutional law perspective, the rise of <b>international</b> <b>commitments</b> outside the Treaty Clause registers as an unvarnished increase in presidential power. Factoring in international law and administrative law reveals a far more nuanced reality. While direct congressional checks on presidential power have weakened, alternative checks have arisen from administrative agencies, the international legal structure, and even to some degree from U. S. states. This Article describes the reconfigured landscape of checks and balances, which are spread across the negotiation, domestic approval, and implementation of <b>international</b> <b>commitments.</b> It then offers a qualified normative defense of this system and proposes several structural and doctrinal improvements. The Article closes with a case study applying its approach to the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate...|$|R
