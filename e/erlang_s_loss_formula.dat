Some important characteristics of the cellular configuration in soft handoff systems are used to propose a new design of efficient call admission control (CAC) in CDMA systems. Then, the paper constructs a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model for CAC in CDMA with a soft handoff queue, obtains closed-form solutions, and thus develops <b>loss</b> <b>formulas</b> as performance indices {{such as the new}} blocking probability and the handoff dropping probability.

The seemingly conflicting measurements of non-zero particle correlations and R_pA that appears to be consistent with unity demand a more careful analysis of the mechanisms at work in such ostensibly minuscule systems.

40|$|We {{prove that}} for spacetimes solving the Einstein-Maxwell (EM) equations, the {{electromagnetic}} field contributes at highest {{order to the}} nonlinear memory effect of gravitational waves. In [5] D. Christodoulou showed that gravitational waves have a nonlinear memory. He discussed how this effect can be measured as a permanent displacement of test masses in a laser interferometer gravitational wave detector. Christodoulou derived a precise formula for this permanent displacement in the Einstein vacuum (EV) case. We prove in Theorem 6 that for the EM equations this permanent displacement exhibits a term coming from the electromagnetic field. This term {{is at the same}} highest order as the purely gravitational term that governs the EV situation. On the other hand, in Chapter 3, we show that to leading order, the presence of the electromagnetic field does not change the instantaneous displacement of the test masses. Following the method introduced by D. Christodoulou in [5] and asymptotics derived by N. Zipser in [8] and [9], we investigate gravitational radiation at null infinity in spacetimes solving the EM equations. We study the Bondi mass <b>loss</b> <b>formula</b> at null infinity derived in [9].
