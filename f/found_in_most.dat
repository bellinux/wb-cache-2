5|$|Applications of {{matrices}} are <b>found</b> <b>in</b> <b>most</b> scientific fields. In every {{branch of}} physics, including classical mechanics, optics, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, and quantum electrodynamics, {{they are used}} to study physical phenomena, such as the motion of rigid bodies. In computer graphics, {{they are used to}} manipulate 3D models and project them onto a 2-dimensional screen. In probability theory and statistics, stochastic matrices are used to describe sets of probabilities; for instance, they are used within the PageRank algorithm that ranks the pages in a Google search. Matrix calculus generalizes classical analytical notions such as derivatives and exponentials to higher dimensions. Matrices are used in economics to describe systems of economic relationships.|$|E
