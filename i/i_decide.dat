500|$|I wanted {{somebody}} with a tremendous {{understanding of how to}} make a pop video, because my biggest challenge working with directors is that I am the director and I write the treatments and I get the fashion and <b>I</b> <b>decide</b> what it's about and it's very hard to find directors that will relinquish any sort of input from the artist. ... But Francis and I worked together. ... It was collaborative. He's a really pop video director and a filmmaker. He did I Am Legend and I'm a huge Will Smith fan, so I knew he could execute the video in a way that I could give him all my weirdest, most psychotic ideas ... But it would come across to and be relevant to the public.|$|E
500|$|Garcia {{elected to}} become a free agent in the offseason, but he {{returned}} to the Indians, saying that his home and his dry cleaning business were in Cleveland. [...] "Everything being equal, I'll sign with the Indians if <b>I</b> <b>decide</b> I'm able to pitch... This is a friendly city and I like it", he said. During a spring training game in March 1959, Garcia was hit in the knee by a Billy Consolo line drive and was carried off the field on a stretcher and taken to a Tucson hospital. He did not make his first season start until May 3, when he allowed four hits and no earned runs in a complete game loss. He finished with a 3–6 record, a 4.00ERA and 72 innings pitched in his twelfth and final season with the Indians.|$|E
500|$|Sullivan told an interviewer, Arthur Lawrence, [...] "I don't use {{the piano}} in {{composition}} – {{that would limit}} me terribly". [...] Sullivan explained that his process was not to wait for inspiration, but [...] "to dig for it. ... <b>I</b> <b>decide</b> on [...] before I come {{to the question of}} melody. ... I mark out the metre in dots and dashes, and not until I have quite settled on the rhythm do I proceed to actual notation." [...] Sullivan's text setting, compared with that of his 19th century English predecessors or his European contemporaries, was [...] "vastly more sensitive. ... Sullivan's operatic style attempts to create for itself a uniquely English text-music synthesis", and, in addition, by adopting a conservative musical style, he was able to achieve [...] "the clarity to match Gilbert's finely honed wit with musical wit of his own." ...|$|E

500|$|Martin is firm about {{ending the}} {{series with the}} seventh novel [...] "until <b>I</b> <b>decide</b> not to be firm". With his stated goal of telling the story from {{beginning}} to end, he will not truncate the story to fit into an arbitrary number of volumes. He knows the ending in broad strokes {{as well as the}} future of the main characters, and will finish the series with bittersweet elements where not everyone will live happily ever after. Martin hopes to write an ending similar to The Lord of the Rings that he felt gave the story a satisfying depth and resonance. On the other hand, Martin noted the challenge to avoid a situation like the finale of the TV series Lost, which left some fans disappointed by deviating too far from their own theories and desires. In 2015, Martin said that he was not writing A Dream of Spring together with The Winds of Winter, and in early 2016, {{he said he did not}} believe A Dream of Spring would be published before the last season of the HBO show.|$|E
500|$|Early press {{coverage}} was [...] "mixed", generally {{a combination of}} [...] "embarrassment and puzzlement". The historical novelist and poet Maurice Hewlett published {{a series of articles}} in the literary journal John O' London's Weekly, in which he concluded: [...] "And knowing children, and knowing that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has legs, <b>I</b> <b>decide</b> that the Miss Carpenters have pulled one of them." [...] The Sydney newspaper Truth on 5 January 1921 expressed a similar view; [...] "For the true explanation of these fairy photographs what is wanted is not a knowledge of occult phenomena but a knowledge of children." [...] Some public figures were more sympathetic. Margaret McMillan, the educational and social reformer, wrote: [...] "How wonderful that to these dear children such a wonderful gift has been vouchsafed." [...] The novelist Henry De Vere Stacpoole decided to take the fairy photographs and the girls at face value. In a letter to Gardner he wrote: [...] "Look at Alice's [...] face. Look at Iris's [...] face. There is an extraordinary thing called Truth which has 10million faces and forms– it is God's currency and the cleverest coiner or forger can't imitate it." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Antestor {{changed their}} style {{into a more}} modern black metal, and {{released}} their first set of new songs since The Return of the Black Death in an EP called Det tapte liv ("The Lost Life"). Det tapte liv concentrated less on the black metal aspects of Antestor's style, instead focusing more on instrumental songs. [...] However, it hinted at what the band was preparing for their 2005 full-length, The Forsaken. The cover arts for both releases were once again done by Kristian Wåhlin, and the cover for the EP depicts the Borgund Stave Church. Hellhammer played all drums on both of these releases. In {{an interview with the}} Russian metal site Metal Library on January 7, 2007, Blomberg was asked what did his Mayhem colleagues and record company think about his participation in Antestor, and he said: [...] "To be honest, it was a big 'fuck off!' to them all. I will repeat again that <b>I</b> <b>decide</b> what I do and I play not only in black metal groups." [...] The band also asked Hellhammer to play live for them, but Blomberg refused. Hellhammer also went to state: [...] "In my opinion, black metal today is just music. I will tell you that neither I nor other members of Mayhem never really were against religion or something else. We are primarily interested in music." [...] Ronny Hansen commented on Blomberg's appearance: ...|$|E

2500|$|Founded in 1976, the Law School {{is named}} for Supreme Court Justice Benjamin N. Cardozo. Cardozo, {{who was born in}} 1870 in New York City, and was renowned for his integrity, social consciousness, and {{important}} opinions. Cardozo studied law at Columbia Law School from 1889–91 and subsequently rose to prominence during 23 years of private practice, becoming known as a lawyer’s lawyer before appointment to the New York State Court of Appeals in 1914. His tenure was marked by a number of original rulings, in tort and contract law in particular. This is partly due to timing; rapid industrialization was forcing courts to look anew at old common law components to adapt to new settings. He became the nation’s best-known and most admired state court judge. He added to his reputation through highly acclaimed off-the-bench writings, of which the most important is The Nature of the Judicial Process (1921). Shortly thereafter, Cardozo {{became a member of the}} group that founded the American Law Institute, which crafted a Restatement of the Law of Torts, Contracts, and a host of other private law subjects. He wrote three other books that also became standards in the legal world. By asking, and answering, the monumentally simple question, [...] "What is it that I do when <b>I</b> <b>decide</b> a case?", he helped many see the judicial role with greater clarity. In 1932, President Herbert Hoover appointed Cardozo to succeed Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. on the Supreme Court. In his six years as an Associate Justice, he handed down opinions that stressed the necessity for the law to adapt to the realities and needs of modern life. The New York Times said of Cardozo's appointment that [...] "seldom, if ever, in the history of the Court has an appointment been so universally commended." [...] Democratic Cardozo's appointment by a Republican president has been referred to as one of the few Supreme Court appointments in history not motivated by partisanship or politics, but strictly based on the nominee's contribution to law.|$|E
