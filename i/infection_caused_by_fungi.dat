40|$|Mucormycosis is a {{rare and}} {{opportunistic}} <b>infection</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>fungi</b> belonging to the order Mucorales. Recent reports have demonstrated an increasing incidence of mucormycosis, which is frequently lethal, especially in patients suffering from severe underlying conditions such as immunodeficiency. In addition, even though conventional mycology and histopathology assays allow for the identification of Mucorales, they often fail in offering a species-specific diagnosis. Due {{to the lack of}} other laboratory tests, a precise identification of these molds is thus notoriously difficult. In this study we aimed to develop a molecular biology tool to identify the main Mucorales involved in human pathology. A PCR strategy selectively amplifies genomic DNA from molds belonging to the genera Absidia, Mucor, Rhizopus, and Rhizomucor, excluding human DNA and DNA from other filamentous fungi and yeasts. A subsequent digestion step identified the Mucorales at genus and species level. This technique was validated using both fungal cultures and retrospective analyses of clinical samples. By enabling a rapid and precise identification of Mucorales strains in infected patients, this PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism-based method should help clinicians to decide on the appropriate treatment, consequently decreasing the mortality of mucormycosis...|$|E
40|$|Mucormycosis is an {{opportunistic}} <b>infection</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>fungi</b> of {{the order}} Mucorales. The commonest clinical form is rhinocerebral mucormycosis, which {{has been described as}} characteristically complicating diabetes mellitus and leukemia. Three patients with rhinocerebral mucormycosis complicating renal transplantation are described, and 11 ad-ditional cases recorded in the English-language medical literature are reviewed. The mean age of the 14 patients was 36 years, and the ratio of males to females was 1. 8 : 1. Diabetes mellitus was present in only five patients, and polycystic kidney was the most common underlying renal disease. Most kidney grafts were obtained from cadavers. Eight patients had evidence of graft rejection, and the majority had been receiving corticosteroids and azathioprine. The initial manifestations of infection became evident two days to four years after transplantation (median, two months). Facial swelling, tissue necrosis, and cranial nerve involvement were common. Seven of 14 cases occurred in Israel, a finding suggest-ing the intervention of local factors. Despite antifungal and/or surgical therapy, nine pa-tients died {{as a consequence of the}} infection days to months after diagnosis.

40|$|Invasive {{aspergillosis}} (IA), an <b>infection</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>fungi</b> in {{the genus}} Aspergillus, {{is seen in}} patients with immunological deficits, particularly acute leukaemia and stem cell transplantation, and {{has been associated with}} high rates of mortality in previous years. Diagnosing IA has long been problematic owing to the inability to culture the main causal agent A. fumigatus from blood. Microscopic examination and culture of respiratory tract specimens have lacked sensitivity, and biopsy tissue for histopathological examination is rarely obtainable. Thus, for many years there has been a great interest in nonculture-based techniques such as the detection of galactomannan, β-D-glucan, and DNA by PCR-based methods. Recent meta-analyses suggest that these approaches have broadly similar performance parameters in terms of sensitivity and specificity to diagnose IA. Improvements have been made in our understanding of the limitations of antigen assays and the standardisation of PCR-based DNA detection. Thus, in more recent years, the debate has focussed on how these assays can be incorporated into diagnostic strategies to maximise improvements in outcome whilst limiting unnecessary use of antifungal therapy. Furthermore, there is a current interest in applying these tests to monitor the effectiveness of therapy after diagnosis and predict clinical outcomes. The search for improved markers for the early and sensitive diagnosis of IA continues to be a challenge...|$|E
