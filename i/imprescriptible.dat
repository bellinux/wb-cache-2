6000|$|In May 1774 Lewis XV. died. His {{successor}} {{was only}} twenty years old; he was sluggish in mind, vacillating in temper, and inexperienced in affairs. Maurepas was recalled, {{to become the}} new king's chief adviser; and Maurepas, {{at the suggestion of}} one of Turgot's college friends, summoned the Intendant from Limoges, and placed him {{at the head of the}} department of marine. This post Turgot only held for a couple of months; he was then preferred to the great office of Controller-General. The condition of the national finance made its administration the most important of all the departments of the government. Turgot's policy in this high sphere belongs to the general history of France, and there is no occasion for us to reproduce its details here. It was mainly an attempt to extend over the whole realm the kind of reforms which had been tried on a small scale in the Limousin. He suppressed the corvées, and he tacked the money payment which was substituted for that burden on to the Twentieths, an impost from which the privileged class was not exempt. 'The weight of this charge,' he made the king say in the edict of suppression, 'now falls and must fall only on the poorest classes of our subjects.' This truth only added to the exasperation of the rich, and perhaps might well have been omitted. Along with the corvées were suppressed the jurandes, or exclusive industrial corporations or trade-guilds, whose monopolies and restrictions were so mischievous an impediment to the wellbeing of the country. In the preamble to this edict we seem to be breathing the air, not of Versailles in 1775, but of the Convention in 1793:--'God, when he made man with wants, and rendered labour an indispensable resource, made the right of work the property of every individual in the world, and this property is the first, the most sacred, and the most <b>imprescriptible</b> of all kinds of property. We regard it as one of the first duties of our justice, and as one of the acts most of all worthy of our benevolence, to free our subjects from every infraction of that inalienable right of humanity.' ...|$|E

A thesis is presented that Russia bases its approach to international law on the realist school, while the approach of Estonia {{is considered to be}} guided by a mixture of politically orientated jurisprudence and new wave. Considering Russia’s approach, it is examined whether Estonia can exercise foreign legal policy.

On the basis of that thesis, the report analyzes {{the views of}} some of Russia’s representatives (Stanislav Tšernitšenko, Mihhail Demurin and Konstantin Kossatšov), whose political and legal arguments shape Russia’s action towards Estonia. Estonia’s arguments are studied on the example of the investigation of <b>imprescriptible</b> international crimes and two decisions of the European Court of Human rights (Kolk & Kislyiy v. Estonia, Penart v. Estonia) by which the country has indirectly asserted its positions through foreign legal policy.

40|$|There {{is perhaps}} no text with a broader {{impact on our}} lives than the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). It is strange, therefore, that historians have paid so little {{attention}} to the UDHR. I argue that its potential impact on the study of history is profound. After asking whether the UDHR contains a general view of history, I address the consequences of the UDHR for the rights and duties of historians, and explain how it deals with their subjects of study. I demonstrate that the UDHR is a direct source of five important rights for historians: the rights to free expression and information, to meet and found associations, to intellectual property, to academic freedom, and to silence. It is also an indirect source of three duties for historians: the duties to produce expert knowledge about the past, to disseminate it, and to teach about it. I discuss the limits to, and conflicts among, these rights and duties. The UDHR also has an impact on historians' subjects of study: I argue that the UDHR applies to the living but not to the dead, and that, consequently, it is a compass for studying recent rather than remote historical injustice. Nevertheless, and although it is itself silent about historians' core duties to find and tell the truth, the UDHR firmly supports an emerging <b>imprescriptible</b> right to the truth, which in crucial respects is nothing less than a right to history. If the UDHR is a "Magna Carta of all men everywhere," it surely is one for all historians...|$|E

40|$|This research, {{extensively}} {{based on}} unpublished manuscript sources, {{deals with the}} topic of the origins of the clash between the political power and the judiciary within a perspective of institutional history. In eighteenth-century France, from the death of Louis XIV to the Revolution, the traditional combat between the crown and the judiciary was revived after the long break the reign of the sun king. The battle marked the whole life of the state and its major institutions, accelerating the cultural and political debate, and involving broad sections of civil society and religious and ecclesiastical world. All major issues, both theoretical and practical, of the ancien régime emerge from the analysis of this conflict: from the actual working of the absolutist apparatus to the concept of "constitution", not at all incompatible with the system of absolute monarchy legitimized by divine right. To {{the vast majority of the}} protagonists of the political and institutional life, who had a legal training, the "constitutional" doctrine was conceived and developed within the absolute state; it was not alternative to it. The absolutist system was more than necessary for the patriarchal mediation of the judiciary. The "fundamental laws of the kingdom" and all other "ordinary" laws enclosed a set of principles aimed at ensuring rights of the subjects that were unalterable, inalienable and <b>imprescriptible.</b> Such rights - the lawyers argued - could be defended only through legal institutions. Hence the priority value assigned to the judiciary, primarily to the “Parlements”, considered "sovereign courts," and their officials. Among them, those invested with the judicial functions were called “robins” for the symbolic value assumed by the robe, worn and shown off as a symbol of their status. The study of the "ideology" of the “robins”, i. e. the fundamental matrix of their thinking, their culture, their doctrines, allows us to examine the most significant phenomena of that important period in the history of the state and helps to explain the deep meaning of the political action led by the most important socioinstitutional "body" then existing. The robins were the chief protagonists of a dialectic that was not only - as has been argued - the symptom of a particular moment of crisis in the system, but the diarchic essential condition of the absolute state that emerges from the metaphor of the “king's two bodies”. It thus casts light on the origin of a fundamental problem that returns endemically also in contemporary society and states...|$|E
40|$|THESIS RESUME For the Mexican {{people the}} {{petroleum}} {{is not just}} a hydrocarbon, but part of their national identity. It is a kind of patriotic symbol and a main part of their sovereignty. This is reflected in their Constitution in Article 27, fourth paragraph, which states that the nation has direct ownership for all minerals or substances found in veins, strata and other forms of deposits. The ownership by the nation is inalienable and <b>imprescriptible.</b> Furthermore only the State, through its oil company, can carry out the different activities for the exploitation of hydrocarbons. Thus, {{in order to be able}} to make a cross-border unitization agreement for the common fields with USA, on a country level, is necessary to first amend Constitutional Article 27 and its Regulatory Law to be able to make a field unitization on a license level. Especially since Mexico faces the American Rule of Capture. The moratorium of 10 years for the commercial exploitation of the common deposits, established in the Doughnut Hole Treaty, signed by both countries, ends on January 16 th 2011, which means in less than three years. Mexico has done nothing to explore the area and to prepare its oil company (PEMEX) with the technology and the legal framework to start the commercial exploitation of the common reserves. This problem must be solved before it becomes a critical political issue in the bilateral relations of the states or even explodes into a full scale dispute. Solutions then usually become even more difficult to reach as the situation becomes burdened with exacerbated nationalistic attitudes. An attempt to reach a diplomatic agreement for the unitization of the transboundary reserves and the joint operation of the fields seems to be a much better approach. This thesis is planned as a proposal for the solution of the potential conflict. It analyzes different unitization systems adopted internationally and explores how the countries can benefit from each other s experience. It is necessary to state that I will not deal with unitization agreements between licensees because of the complexity and extent of the topic, which deserves a separate study and is beyond the scope of this thesis. For the same reason, the study will not deal with technical issues, such as the structure of allocation formulas for the determination and redetermination of reserves, as well as apportionment of deposits, despite the fact that information about this was found. Neither does the thesis study maritime delimitation boundary agreements, but some are briefly commented in different cases because this is an issue that needs to be addressed in order to make a unitization agreement of transboundary oil fields...|$|E
