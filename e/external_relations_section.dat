50|$|In a gō-mei gaisha (合名会社), all {{partners}} are {{jointly and severally}} liable for any liability incurred by the partnership, similar to an unlimited partnership. The partners' liability is unlimited, and creditors can go after each partner's personal assets if the assets of the partnership are insufficient to meet the obligations. The law divides legal relations of the Go-mei Gaisha into two categories: internal <b>relations</b> specified in <b>Section</b> 2 of the Go-mei Gaisha Law and <b>external</b> <b>relations</b> specified in <b>Section</b> 3 of the Go-mei Gaisha Law. Internal relations refers to relations between the partnership and the partners as well as relations among partners. The Commercial Code specifies that both the articles of incorporation and the Commercial Code govern these internal relations, but it has been commonly interpreted that the articles of incorporation overrides the Commercial Code when determining these rights. External relationship refers to relations between the partnership and third parties as well as between a partner and third parties. <b>External</b> <b>relations</b> are governed by law to protect third parties by providing a fair, stable, and foreseeable legal relations.|$|R
40|$|T]he {{hypothesis}} {{of this paper}} is: The more the EU is able to encapsulate {{the interests of the}} fifteen member states in a common front, the greater are the opportunities for more beneficial agreements with the United States, and to constrain or replace the actions or inactions of the U. S. hegemony. In order to support this proposition, {{the first part of this}} paper focuses on the current theoretical debate on the transatlantic relationship. Secondly, the paper analyzes the nature of the EU foreign policy, emphasizing the problems associated with the intergovernmental and supranational model to design its <b>external</b> <b>relations.</b> The third <b>section</b> describes the relative balance between the U. S. and the EU on economic terms, and considers the benefits of having international institutions to regulate trade practices. Finally, the imbalance in security affairs is depicted, highlighting the new institutional developments in Europe to participate in regional crises with or without (but not against) the United States...|$|R

40|$|Interest in {{the role}} of International Parliamentary Institutions (IPIs) remains {{extremely}} limited, especially if one considers their growing numbers, functions, and importance in the international relations of a globalizing world. This article aims at contextualizing the European Parliament (EP) ’s international role according to the IPIs literature, by asking whether the EP can be included in comparative studies on IPIs or, on the contrary, if it should rather be considered a ‘sui generis’ phenomenon – because of its role in European Union (EU) integration and the scope of its powers. Our argument is that the EP can (and should) be included in comparative studies on IPIs, at least for two different reasons: (i) by exploring conditions under which IPIs are established and empowered; (ii) by analysing the EP’s <b>external</b> <b>relations.</b> As a result, both the literature on IPIs and that on the external dimension of the EP will be enriched and allow for more, including synergetic, work in areas where there still is a clear academic gap. Accordingly, there will be three different sections. The first section will offer the background empirical description of what IPIs are, what their historical evolution has been, as well what are the more relevant definitions and categorizations offered by the literature to date. In the following section, the main argument will be developed, through the operationalization of IPIs’ different powers. After a brief presentation of the specific tools that the EP has been developing over the years in its <b>external</b> <b>relations,</b> the third <b>section</b> will focus on its inter-parliamentary assemblies. Finally, the conclusions will sum up some general findings, as well as identify a number of possible avenues for future research on the role of IPIs in world affairs...|$|R

ABSTRACT: This {{dissertation}} work deals with <b>external</b> <b>relations</b> between {{a school and}} its stakeholders and their management. <b>External</b> <b>relations</b> are studied in schools {{at all levels of}} education (ISCED 0 - 6). Pedagogical sciences, management, marketing, psychology and sociology serve as the theoretical basis. The primary theme of the thesis is regional colleges in the Czech Republic, whose <b>external</b> <b>relations</b> are considered an important principle of their development. We deal with major theoretical and political starting points of research into the <b>external</b> <b>relations</b> of regional colleges based on national and international educational policy documents; we take into account the context of changes in higher education systems and colleges in recent decades in our country and the world. The empirical part illustrates the changes in <b>external</b> <b>relations</b> of various types of schools using case studies successively at kindergartens, primary and secondary schools. We focus on an analysis of <b>external</b> <b>relations</b> and their management of regional colleges in the Czech Republic in more detail. We present the results of a secondary analysis of major [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Mergers and {{acquisitions}} (M&A) {{have become a}} highly popular form of corporate development. The research in the M&A field is extensive, {{but there is a}} lack of research regarding how <b>external</b> <b>relations</b> are affected when the M&As do not work out as planned, and whether competitors can win if the M&A fails. This study explores whether and how an M&A that struggles affects its <b>external</b> <b>relations.</b> The study was conducted using a case study of a well-known, struggling Norwegian M&A: SAS Braathens, and the <b>external</b> <b>relations</b> examined were the competitors, the customers, and the media. The main finding of this paper shows that an M&A that struggles can affect its <b>external</b> <b>relations</b> negatively. To what degree the <b>external</b> <b>relations</b> will be affected, depends on the change in market structure and the market share of the M&A, how differentiated the products in the industry are, existing substitutes, and if the struggling affects the public or not. Further, this paper finds that the main reasons for SAS Braathens struggle can be traced back to poor communication and the management...|$|R
