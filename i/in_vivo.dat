B-ring hydroxylation status and pH have been shown to mediate the degradation of anthocyanins to their phenolic acid and aldehyde constituents. Indeed, significant portions of ingested anthocyanins are likely to degrade to phenolic acids and aldehyde <b>in</b> <b>vivo,</b> following consumption.

Expression of the NK cell activation marker CD 16 / 56 (+) CD 69 (+) <b>in</b> ex <b>vivo</b> unstimulated blood cells was 62 % higher at week 10 and 74 % higher at week 14. Intracellular staining of IL- 4 <b>in</b> ex <b>vivo</b> unstimulated and PMA/ionomycin-stimulated CD 3 (+) β 7 (+) integrin blood cells was significantly lower at week 10 and 14. Intracellular staining of IL- 12 <b>in</b> ex <b>vivo</b> unstimulated and LPS-stimulated CD 14 (+) blood cells was significantly lower at weeks 4, 10 and 14. Intracellular staining of TNF-α in LPS-stimulated CD 14 (+) blood cells was significantly lower at weeks 4, 10 and 14. Mucosal salivary IFN-γ, IgA 1 and IgA 2 concentrations were significantly higher at week 14 but LcS did not affect systemic circulating influenza A-specific IgA or IgG and tetanus specific IgG antibody levels. In addition to the decrease in CD 3 (+) β 7 (+) integrin cell IL- 4 and a CD 14 (+) cell anti-inflammatory cytokine profile, at week 14 increased expression of activation markers on circulating T cells and NK cells and higher mucosal salivary IgA 1 and IgA 2 concentration indicated a secondary boosting effect of LcS.
