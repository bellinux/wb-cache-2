Nikasti travelled all through England, studied our social life, measured our weaknesses; did the same through Germany, returned to Japan, and gave his vote in favour of Germany. I have even seen a copy of his report. He laid great stress upon the absolute devotion to sport of our young men, and the entire absence of any patriotic sentiment or any means of national defence. Well, as you know, for various reasons his counsels were over-ridden, and Japan chose the British alliance. That was entirely the fault of imperfect German diplomacy. At a time like this, though, I cannot help thinking that some elements of his former distrust still remain in Nikasti's mind, and I have an idea that Baron Yung is, to a certain extent, a sympathiser.

Sure enough sleep must soon have come to me, for I remember no more. Jonathan coming in had not waked me, for he lay by my side when next I remember. There was in the room the same thin white mist that I had before noticed. But I forget now if you know of this. You will find it in my diary which I shall show you later. I felt the same vague terror which had come to me before and the same sense of some presence. I turned to wake Jonathan, but found that he slept so soundly that it seemed as if it was he who had taken the sleeping draught, and not I. I tried, but I could not wake him. This caused me a great fear, and I looked around terrified. Then indeed, my heart sank within me. Beside the bed, as if he had stepped out of the mist, or rather as if the mist had turned into his figure, for it had entirely disappeared, stood a tall, thin man, all in black. I knew him at once from the description of the others. The waxen face, the high aquiline nose, on which the light fell in a thin white line, the parted red lips, with the sharp white teeth showing between, and the red eyes that I had seemed to see in the sunset on the windows of St. Mary's Church at Whitby. I knew, too, the red scar on his forehead where Jonathan had struck him. For an instant my heart stood still, and I would have screamed out, only that I was paralyzed. In the pause he spoke in a sort of keen, cutting whisper, pointing as he spoke to Jonathan.|$|E

40|$|Much of the {{continuing}} success of AGU {{is a result of}} the volunteer work of members. A major contribution to these efforts is from the over 40 committees that plan, oversee, and have operational roles in our meetings, publi-cations, finances, elections, awards, outreach, and technical activities. The names of committees are provided in the accompanying text box; their current membership and descriptions can be found on the Web. One of the most important but difficult tasks of the incoming AGU President is to re-establish these commit-tees by appointing hundreds of volunteers. Thus, <b>I</b> now urgently <b>need</b> <b>your</b> <b>help</b> in staffing these committees. I encourage you to volunteer for committees and/or nominate other AGU members to com-mittees. Such suggestions are more helpful, and more likely to be followed, if accompanied by a few lines giving the reasons why you, or whomever else you suggest, would be a good fit to the particular committee’s activities. Service on several of the committees involves one or two committee meetings per year usu-ally at AGU headquarters in Washington. These meetings are approximately 2 days each and, of course, there is some preparation for them. Other committees conduct their activities through e-mail and conference calls, and, as required,meet during the annual AGU meetings. Members are reimbursed for their expenses for attendance at meetings not held at the annual AGU meetings. Service on these com-mittees provides the individual member with an inside look at how the AGU functions and the personal reward for having contributed to the health of the Union in a substantive way.

5000|$|In {{a letter}} of 27 December 2000, Arafat asked for some {{clarification}} of the proposals:Mr. President, please allow me address you with all the sincerity emanating from the close friendship that ties us, and the historical importance {{of what you are}} trying to do. I want to assure you of my will to continue to work with you to reach a peace agreement. <b>I</b> <b>need</b> <b>your</b> <b>help</b> in clarifying and explaining the basis of your initiative.I need clear answers to many questions relating to calculation of land ratios that will be annexed and swapped, and the actual location of these territories, as well as the basis for defining the Wailing Wall, its borders and extensions, and the effect of that on the concept of full Palestinian sovereignty over al-Haram al-Sharif.We understand that the idea of leasing additional territory is an option {{we have the right to}} reject, and is not a parameter of your bridging proposals. We also presume that the emergency Israeli locations are also subject to negotiations and to our approval. I hope that you have the same understanding.I have many questions relating to the return of refugees to their homes and villages. I have a negative experience with the return of displaced Palestinians to the West Bank and Gaza during the Interim Period. Because the modalities remained tied to an Israeli veto, not one refugee was allowed to return through the mechanism of the interim agreement, which required a quadripartite committee of Egypt, Jordan, Israel and Palestine to decide on their return. Equally, I don't see a clear approach dealing with compensation of the refugees for their land, property and funds taken by Israel under the aegis of the Israeli custodian of absentee property.I feel, Mr. President, that the period for Israeli withdrawal specified in your initiative is too long. It will allow the enemies of peace to exploit the time to undo the agreement. I wonder if the [...] "Period" [...] is one of the fixed parameters of your proposal; a [...] "basis" [...] that cannot be changed.Mr. President, I have many questions. I need maps, details, and clarifications that can help me take the necessary decisions with my leadership and people.I would like you to appreciate that I do not want to procrastinate or waste time.We need a real opportunity to invest once more your determination and creativity to reach a fair and lasting peace with you efforts and during your presidency.I remain, Mr. President, ready to pay you a visit at the White House, in the shortest possible time if you find this visit appropriate, to discuss with you the bridging proposals and to exchange views on ways to develop them further.Please accept my highest regards and best wishes,Yasser ArafatAccording to Clayton Swisher,Arafat's letter [...] "punctures yet another myth of Palestinian rejectionism ... that Israel accepted parameters while the Palestinians rejected them...
