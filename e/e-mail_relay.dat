50|$|After {{members of}} a Taiwanese {{religious}} movement in Garland, Texas, did not find God on television on a day in March 1998, an officer of TECO Houston offered assistance {{to members of the}} movement to assist travel back to Taiwan. On September 23, 2002, an <b>e-mail</b> <b>relayed</b> through TECO Houston warned the ROC government that there was a possibility of a terrorist attack. In 2005 Lieutenant Governor of Louisiana Mitch Landrieu and Kip Holden, Mayor-President of East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana, met with a delegation of TECO Houston officials to negotiate Taiwanese business interests in Louisiana. In 2007 Crescent honored the consulate's information division as a tenant that had occupied a suite in Greenway Plaza for 20-29 years.|$|R

50|$|Since open mail relays make {{no effort}} to {{authenticate}} the sender of an <b>e-mail,</b> open mail <b>relays</b> are vulnerable to address spoofing.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the major}} threats to the E-mail service are message loops, mail {{messages}} which endlessly circulate between a number of <b>E-mail</b> <b>relays</b> and severely deteriorate or even interrupt the messaging service. Although the standards ruling E-mail communications include mechanisms to prevent message loops, these mechanisms are often unimplemented and, if they are, can fail to work reliably under certain circumstances. This paper describes a novel approach to the automatic and reliable elimination of looping messages. Statistical properties of the message traffic are analyzed to detect messages that might be looping. Such messages are earmarked, {{and if they are}} observed to actually be looping, they are eliminated. This method has been implemented and successfully applied in the multi-protocol E-mail environment of the University of Geneva. Problem description A message is said to be looping if it is forwarded endlessly in a circular manner among a set of mail relays (Message Transfer Agents or MTAs). Normally...|$|R
50|$|On-Demand Mail Relay (ODMR) is an SMTP {{extension}} standardized in RFC 2645 {{that allows}} <b>e-mail</b> to be <b>relayed</b> to the recipients {{after they have}} been authenticated.

40|$|This {{paper will}} discuss tracing e-mail headers and issues {{associated}} with it. It will address both HTTP & SMTP initiated e-mails. It will discuss different ways used by e-mail senders to evade tracing and workarounds used by investigators to combat them. It will also discuss advanced measures and techniques used by investigators to track emails. The paper will not however discuss any particular tools nor endorse any software products in its coverage.

E-MAIL COMPONENTS E-mails are made of two main parts; they are the message header and message body. The header part contains routing information about the e-mail and other information such as the source and destination of the e-mail, the IP address of the sender and time related information. The message body contains the actual message of the email, i. e. message subject and body. The body might also contain attachments {{in the form of}} MIME or SMIME (Lewis, 2004). Message headers are the important part for investigating e-mail messages and will be discusse...|$|R
50|$|SHRED is thus {{effectively}} {{an electronic}} reputation system, where reputation—in {{the form of}} being able to affix stamps to E-mail—is lost through complaints, and has to be bought back with money, thus imposing a financial cost on the loss of reputation. The presence or absence of a stamp then can be used by E-mail receivers, together with other sources of information such as blacklists, whitelists, and content analysis, to make judgments as to whether <b>E-mail</b> should be <b>relayed</b> or delivered.|$|R
25|$|E-mail {{was first}} invented for CTSS and similar time sharing {{systems of the}} era in the mid-1960s. At first, e-mail was {{possible}} only between different accounts on the same computer (typically a mainframe). ARPANET allowed different computers {{to be connected to}} allow <b>e-mails</b> to be <b>relayed</b> from computer to computer, with the first ARPANET e-mail being sent in 1971. Multics also pioneered instant messaging between computer users in the mid-1970s. With the growth of the Internet, e-mail began to be possible between any two computers with access to the Internet.|$|R
40|$|Since its inception, the Internet {{has been}} a hotbed of several {{successful}} communications channels, starting off with <b>e-mail,</b> Internet <b>Relay</b> Chat and Usenet newsgroups and more recently adding Web annotation, instant messaging, and news feeds. However, these channels were developed fairly independently, {{and in many cases}} their respective functionalities have grown to overlap significantly. For instance, users of these systems have separate identifiers for e-mail, chat, and instant messaging, and clients for these systems all have their own implementations of threaded message views. We believe these problems stem from a lack of a common user interface and data model. In this paper we use basic concepts from the Semantic Web and RDF to unify and model these seemingly disparate messaging paradigms. We also demonstrate a generalized user interface for messaging that uses the data model we have developed. From this process we realize a number of synergies that result from the reduction of overlap and the finer-grained control users are given over message composition, transmission, storage and retrieval...|$|R
5000|$|Until the 1990s, mail servers were {{commonly}} intentionally configured as open relays; this configuration {{was also}} frequently the installation default setting on UNIX systems. [...] The traditional store-and-forward method of <b>relaying</b> <b>e-mail</b> to its destination required {{that it was}} passed from computer to computer (through and beyond the Internet) via modems on telephone lines. For many early networks, such as UUCPNET, FidoNet and BITNET, lists of machines that were open relays were a core part of those networks. Filtering and speed of e-mail delivery were not priorities {{at that time and}} in any case the government and educational servers that started the Internet were covered by a federal edict forbidding the transfer of commercial messages.|$|R
40|$|Since its inception, the Internet {{has been}} a hotbed of {{successful}} communications channels, starting off with <b>e-mail,</b> Internet <b>Relay</b> Chat and Usenet newsgroups and more recently adding weblogs, instant messaging, and news feeds. These systems have been developed quite independently over {{the past half century}} and continue to be extended with new functionality that addresses the broadening needs of their users and supports the full range of semantic expression. Stepping back, however, we observe that having a variety of messaging frameworks creates significant problems for users when attempting to manage and collate messages on a single topic or context that may be discussed via multiple media. We posit that no message should be constrained in this way by its medium. As it is, messaging applications are slowly converging in their functionalities. We show that a unified approach to messaging can be achieved in a single step through appropriate use of the RDF, a Semantic Web technology, as a data model. We further exploit this data model to develop appropriate user interface elements that allow aggregation of messages across protocols, and discuss the benefits that arise from such a scenario...|$|R
25|$|The Internet {{can also}} be {{exploited}} for activities such as terrorism, internet fraud and pedophilia. In recent years, {{there has been an}} increase in crimes that involved the use of the Internet such as <b>e-mails</b> and Internet <b>Relay</b> Chat (IRC), as it is relatively easy to remain anonymous. These conspiracies carry concerns for security and protection. From a forensic linguistic point of view, there are many potential areas to explore. While developing a chat room child protection procedure based on search terms filtering is effective, there is still minimal linguistically orientated literature to facilitate the task. In other areas, it is observed that the Semantic Web has been involved in tasks such as personal data protection, which helps to prevent fraud.|$|R
50|$|These honeypots {{can reveal}} the abuser's IP address and provide bulk spam capture (which enables {{operators}} to determine spammers' URLs and response mechanisms). For open relay honeypots, {{it is possible}} to determine the e-mail addresses ("dropboxes") spammers use as targets for their test messages, which are the tool they use to detect open relays. It is then simple to deceive the spammer: transmit any illicit <b>relay</b> <b>e-mail</b> received addressed to that dropbox e-mail address. That tells the spammer the honeypot is a genuine abusable open relay, and they often respond by sending large quantities of relay spam to that honeypot, which stops it. The apparent source may be another abused system—spammers and other abusers may use a chain of abused systems to make detection of the original starting point of the abuse traffic difficult.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} spam {{detection}} technique, at the packet level (layer 3), based on classification of e-mail contents. Our proposal targets spam control implementations on middleboxes. E-mails are first pre-classified (pre-detected) for spam on a per-packet basis. {{without the need}} for reassembly. This, in turn, allows fast e-mail class estimation (spam detection) at receiving e-mail servers to support more effective spam handling on both inbound and outbound (<b>relayed)</b> <b>e-mails.</b> In this paper, the naive Bayes classification technique is adapted to support both pre-classification and fast e-mail class estimation, on a per-packet basis. We focus on evaluating the accuracy of spam detection at layer 3, considering the constraints on processing byte-streams over the network, including packet reordering, fragmentation, overlapped bytes, and different packet sizes. Results show that the proposed layer- 3 classification technique gives less than 0. 5 % false positive, which approximately equals the performance attained at layer 7. This shows that classifying e-mails at the packet level could differentiate non-spam from spam with high confidence for a viable spam control implementation on middleboxes...|$|R
40|$|The {{advent of}} Web 2. 0 has been {{instrumental}} in paradigm shift of how people communicate? These communications are a rich source of relationship data. Analyzing such a vast amount of relationship data is not a trivial task. Social Network Analysis is a promising field of research {{to take advantage of this}} huge pool of relationship data. But before this data is analyzed from Social Network Analysis perspective, Social Networks have to be extracted from this data. Social network extraction deals with the extraction of online social networks from a wide variety of online resources. These resources include web documents, <b>e-mail</b> communication, Internet <b>relay</b> chats, web usage logs, event logs, instant messenger logs, online blogs etc. Social network extraction is beneficial for many Web mining and social network applications such as expert finding for research guidance, potential speakers and contributors for conferences, journals, workshops, product recommendation, targeted advertising etc. In the last decade, many efforts have been made in the area of social network extraction. As a result, a good number of social network extraction methods have been proposed in the literature. These social network extraction methods use different sources for social network extraction. Some of these systems also use data from more than one resource. Although there are some social network extraction methods which construct a social network manually and as such cannot be considered in this work, as we deal with automatic methods only. In this paper, we classify automatic methods for social network extraction on the basis of information source they use. We also outline a general framework for social network extraction and give some future directions...|$|R
