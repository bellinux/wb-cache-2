30|$|In Section 3, we {{demonstrated}} that <b>higher</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rates</b> correspond with shorter distances between the user and the base station. Since the <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> demand {{is on the}} rise, mobile networks {{will be required to}} provide coverage for these <b>higher</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rates.</b> This implies smaller cell sizes, resulting in a larger number of base stations to cover a certain area and hence larger power consumption. On the other hand, since cell sizes are smaller, there is also a smaller number of users present in a cell and thus the probability of a user requiring the <b>high</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rates</b> in a cell is decreasing. This consideration leads to the opportunity to introduce sleep modes in the network. If all users in a cell can be served by base stations outside the cell, then the base station in the cell is no longer required and can be turned to a sleep mode. Hence, the power consumption of the mobile network can be reduced.|$|R
