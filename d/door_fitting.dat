The longer one stays here the more does {{the spirit of the}} moor sink into one's soul, its vastness, and also its grim charm. When you are once out upon its bosom you have left all traces of modern England behind you, {{but on the other hand}} you are conscious everywhere of the homes and the work of the prehistoric people. On all sides of you as you walk are the houses of these forgotten folk, with their graves and the huge monoliths which are supposed to have marked their temples. As you look at their gray stone huts against the scarred hill-sides you leave your own age behind you, and if you were to see a skin-clad, hairy man crawl out from the low <b>door</b> <b>fitting</b> a flint-tipped arrow on to the string of his bow, you would feel that his presence there was more natural than your own. The strange thing is that they should have lived so thickly on what must always have been most unfruitful soil. I am no antiquarian, but I could imagine that they were some unwarlike and harried race who were forced to accept that which none other would occupy.|$|E

40|$|Bachelor {{thesis is}} focused on the {{manufacturing}} of label <b>door</b> <b>fitting.</b> The part is made of a steel 11 320 with a thickness 1 mm. The batch sice is 150, 000 pcs/ year. The manufaturing technology was choosen a method of rolling cutting with shallow drawing in the combinated tool. Technology and constructional calculating were made for this technology, from which was designed a tool and for it was made drawing. For the calculating total force and work was choosen a press LEPD 100. The costs for manufacturing one part are 39 Kč. The manufacturing is become cost-effective from 8 071 pieces/year...|$|E
40|$|Flexible {{manufacturing}} is a multi-faceted {{term that}} has been used in the automotive industry to imply a multitude of manufacturing criteria. A prominent area of application for such criteria in the automotive industry is the body assembly process. The assembly process is, in turn, divided into a number of sub-processes which include fitting car doors to body openings. As these operations take place before the painting of the car body, they are commonly known as Body in White processes. The <b>door</b> <b>fitting</b> problem is ranked within the top issues of car-quality, since an inadequate door fit causes water leakage, wind noise, difficulties in closing and adversely affects the aesthetic value of the car. This thesis presents a novel computer aided method for fitting manufactured car doors to manufactured car body openings using measured points, by laser sensors, on the door and opening peripheries. The fitting process is modeled as an optimization problem where the door location and orientation parameters are the independent variables and the deviation from the nominal gap is the objective function to be minimized.

A more industrial aesthetic design, and more adventurous {{in its use}} of innovative technologies. Asbestos cement cladding panels are clearly expressed with metal flashings over a base course of foamed slag concrete panels, with windows and <b>doors</b> <b>fitting</b> within the module {{set up by the}} cladding. Unlike the BISF this house proudly displays its lightweight prefab nature, but there are also technical advances that set the Howard House apart, for example the precast concrete perimeter plinth that supports a suspended steel ground floor.

40|$|The project {{involves}} {{designing and}} prototyping new antennas {{adapted to the}} use of RFID technology in the processes of a shop, particularly in real-time inventory and location of all products, and antitheft control. Carry out real-time inventories and location of products reduces the processing time and costs invested in certain respects. Then, the purpose is to eliminate the maximum number of losses and make the stay of a customer in the store as comfortable as possible. Traditional RFID antennas have been designed to work in logistics and warehouse environments. In a shop, the antenna must be adapted to various commercial equipments, such as shelves, sales desks, <b>doors,</b> <b>fitting</b> rooms, etc. Moreover, distribution networks signal to the antenna must be adapted to an environment with a density of antennas higher than usual in logistic applications. This project is part of what is known as ambient intelligence, because it provides a store with a real-time knowledge of what is happening...|$|R
