50|$|The {{group was}} put under {{investigation}} when a merchant complained of two individuals {{trying to use}} a <b>fraudulent</b> <b>credit</b> card to make a large purchase. They {{were found to be}} associated with a group that acquired magnetic stripe codes involving over 100 individuals, organized by a smaller group of 20, and led by a group of five including Pipino. One of the members was his brother. The group made purchases in Slovenia and Italy, including designer clothing, perfumes, high-end appliances, mobile phones, laptop and personal computers, watches, gifts, and meals. Pipino spent over 60 thousand Euro on scratch-and-win cards over two months. Police issued 27 search warrants in Venice, Gorizia, Treviso, and Pordenone, during which they seized <b>fraudulent</b> <b>credit</b> cards, card skimmers, and documents relating to the crimes. He was arrested on 27 March 2013, and released on 31 March with the requirement that he stay in Venice and register with the police daily.

40|$|In {{the first}} Climate Cheats report in April, the Morgan Foundation {{revealed}} {{the full extent}} of how New Zealand used <b>fraudulent</b> carbon <b>credits</b> to meet its international obligations to reduce carbon emissions.  As a country we have done nothing to reduce our emissions thus far, and have instead relied heavily on cheap, <b>fraudulent</b> <b>credits</b> from Russia and the Ukraine. In total we handed over 97 million Emissions Reductions Units – the vast majority of which were likely fraudulent and did not result in any reduction in emissions. These made up some 25 % of the units we handed over in the first Kyoto period. The results of engaging in this scam were that some $ 200 m went into the pockets of foreign criminals, the price of carbon went to virtually zero, our emissions increased, and polluters profited. Finally, the use of these fraudulent units to meet past obligations has allowed the Government to build up a stockpile of units which it is using to meet our future emissions targets, potentially past 2020. The Government’s response to our report was {{to say that it was}} not responsible for purchasing the credits, because these were bought by businesses in the course of the operation of the Emissions Trading Scheme. In this follow up report we identify those businesses that traded most heavily in the cheap, <b>fraudulent</b> foreign <b>credits.</b> If the Government continues to duck responsibility, the risk for these businesses is that the mud sticks to them instead.  The data isn’t perfect, but it gives some interesting results: 	NZ Steel made big profits from buying fraudulent foreign units and selling or banking the (more valuable) free units they got from Government; essentially profiting from polluting. 	The power and petrol companies, led by BP but including Z, Caltex and Genesis, were the biggest users of fraudulent units. They claim they did this to provide the best deal for their customers, but interestingly Mobil didn’t purchase any of these units and somehow remained competitive. 	Some forestry companies also bought the units. Some of these may have been engaging in a rort similar to NZ Steel, but it is hard to tell which companies did this. We want these businesses to join our call for the Government to ‘dump the junk’. At the very least Government should not carry forward any surplus units past 2020; the only reason we have these surplus units is because we traded in fraudulent foreign units in the past. Without the Government stepping in to right the wrong, any company wishing to clear themselves of being implicit in greenwashing faces a potentially large liability...|$|R

Minkow had blamed the {{fraudulent}} charges on unscrupulous contractors and another employee, and paid back most of the victims. However, he had not paid back a homemaker who had been overcharged a few hundred dollars. Minkow ignored the woman's requests to pay her back. The woman tracked down several other {{people who had been}} defrauded by Minkow and gave a diary of her findings to the Los Angeles Times. The Times then wrote a story revealing that Minkow had run up $72,000 in <b>fraudulent</b> <b>credit</b> card charges in 1984 and 1985.

40|$|The Government’s {{plan for}} meeting our Kyoto Protocol {{commitment}} and 2020 emissions reduction target was released late last year. Underlying {{this plan is}} a shocking truth: New Zealand has been a willing participant in a wholesale climate fraud. This report explores this issue in greater detail and establishes three key facts: 	One type of Kyoto carbon credit (the Emission Reduction Unit) was overcome by fraud and corruption in Ukraine and Russia. Virtually all of the credits issued by these countries are ‘hot air’ – they do not represent true emissions reductions. (Chapter 2) 	Proportional to our emissions, New Zealand has been {{by far the largest}} purchaser of these Ukrainian and Russian credits through our Emissions Trading Scheme. This was due to deliberate decisions by the National-led Government to – unlike any other country – continue allowing unlimited use of these and other foreign credits {{for as long as the}} international community let us. (Chapter 3) 	Our Government now plans to knowingly utilise all these <b>fraudulent</b> <b>credits</b> so it can claim we are meeting our international obligations through to at least 2020. Meanwhile our actual emissions continue to grow in excess of our targets. (Chapter 5)   We have been party to a fraud that has potential to damage our international reputation as a clean, green and corruption-free country.   This fraud has had several nasty side-effects: 	It sent the price of carbon units in our Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) to virtually zero, hammering our nascent carbon forestry industry. 	We have seen wholesale conversions of land to dairy, such as the massive Wairakei Pastoral estate managed by State Owned Enterprise Landcorp. 	We have put around $ 200 million in the hands of foreign criminals simply to avoid our ethical obligation to reduce emissions. There has been no environmental benefit when that money could have been used to reduce emissions here. 	In addition, some companies were issued free units by our Government while also being able to exploit the cheap, <b>fraudulent</b> foreign <b>credits.</b> In other words, they have been able to profit from their pollution at the expense of the rest us. Carbon trading is a fine idea, and an economically efficient way to spread the burden of emissions reduction, but it only works if the credits we buy actually represent a true emissions reduction somewhere else. The sad truth is that the foreign credits New Zealand has gorged on up until now have produced little to no climate benefit. We need to put this right, or risk a hit to our international reputation jeopardising our future access to international carbon trading. Our three point plan for putting it right, for introducing integrity into our behaviour, includes: 	Dump the junk – cancelling the <b>fraudulent</b> foreign <b>credits.</b> 	Burn the bank – remove the 2 -for- 1 deal and freeze companies’ free allocation of New Zealand Units for a year to clear the backlog of banked credits in the ETS. 	Keep it clean – keep the ETS closed to international trade until we can be certain the system has integrity. In the meantime we could work closely with some of our Pacific neighbours to develop bilateral arrangements...|$|R
50|$|Justin Petersen, born on July 28, 1960 in Washington D.C., started hacking {{computers}} in 1978. In 1984, {{he moved to}} Los Angeles. It was there he found an affinity for Los Angeles night life, with the Sunset Strip being a major focal point. In 1989, Petersen, using the handle Agent Steal and the alias Eric Heinz {{that he had been}} living under since his departure from the East, cracked the computers of the Pacific Bell Telephone Company in California and used his access to intercept the telephone lines of several local FM radio stations. With this access, he and a couple of associates were able to ensure that they were the only callers who could get through during on-air contests, and thus the only winners. Although the associates remain officially unknown, strong rumors persist that Kevin Poulsen (aka Dark Dante), and Ronald Austin were involved. Their winnings included $50,000 in cash, several trips to Hawaii and two Porsches. Realizing he was being pursued by the FBI, Petersen moved to Texas, where he then hacked into a national credit reporting agency, ordered <b>fraudulent</b> <b>credit</b> cards using the information he found, and used them freely.|$|E

This leads to multiple changes in the infrastructure that raise interesting and challenging research questions. The re-sulting dynamic CEP infrastructure not only makes existing applications more powerful and easier to maintain but also enables novel application domains. 1...|$|E
