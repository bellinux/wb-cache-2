40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the design of <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> curvature, meant for rail vehicle. Flat glass is adhesively bonded onto the curved <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> and due to the elastic {{deformation}} the <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> bends backwards. Hence the <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> must be bend with reserve so that the elastic deformation is covered. Finite element analysis of currently manufactured door with constant curvatere has been carried out, with this analysis it has been checked that the chosen problem approach is suitable. Design of <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> curvature is then made for <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> with combined curvature (different for lower and upper part of <b>door</b> <b>frame).</b> The aim of this thesis was to design the curvature so that after glass is bonded onto it, the <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> will have the right dimensions...|$|R

40|$|This study {{discusses}} about assessing {{and enhancing}} {{the production line}} in <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> industries by using simulation method. The scope {{of this study is}} focusing on the production processes of a <b>Door</b> <b>Frame</b> Factory. The time frame covered is one year which is in year 2015. Simulation is a planning tool, implemented in the processes which required by the factory to meet the changing demands of the products. Modeling <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> production will be developed using Arena simulation software to test run and make comparison with the real world system. It is a quantitative study which the performance of the processes is measured by average wait time, machine utilization and operator utilization for the entire system of <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> production. The results obtained from the simulation software will act as an attempt to simulate the “What-If Analysis” scenarios to forecast the performance of real world system without developing costly implementation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the research of}} a specific problem met in woodworking practice by the company K that manufactures <b>door</b> <b>frames</b> made of MDF boards (medium density fi breboards). Visible side surfaces of MDF <b>door</b> <b>frames</b> were lacquered with white polyurethane lacquer. Thirty days after installation, longitudinal surface cracks appeared in the lacquer fi lm on side planes of the <b>door</b> <b>frame.</b> Within the research of the said appearance of cracks, testing was carried out of technical properties and free formaldehyde concentration of the original <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> made of MDF boards by the manufacturer K, MDF boards of the same manufacturer from <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> plant, MDF boards made by the manufacturer H and lacquered experimental MDF boards of both manufacturers. The lacquered surface structure was tested by applying 97 % sulphuric acid (H 2 SO 4) on 5 mm thick lattices that were cut out from side planes of experimental and original <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> samples. The action of acid destructed the lacquer final layer, and pigmented base with other additives was scraped off the surface. It was noticed that the lacquer film on the original <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> made of MDF panels by the manufacturer K had no two-component polyurethane clear base, or that it was applied {{in a very small}} quantity. Lacquer film cracking on side planes is the consequence of in-depth cracks in the structure of MDF panels that occur thirty days after lacquering. Experimental boards designated KE, produced by MDF manufacturer K, have an optimum layer of two-component polyurethane clear base, two-component polyurethane white base and two-component polyurethane semi gloss enamel paint. On side planes of these boards no distinctive cracks were observed. In lacquering MDF boards, it is necessary to apply two-component polyurethane clear base on side planes, and to fully protect the <b>door</b> <b>frames</b> with polyurethane films, and not only the visible planes. The use of load bearing MDF boards is necessary in dry conditions - MDF. LA type, and in increased relative humidity, fibreboards are required for general use in humid conditions - MDF. H type or load bearing boards for use in humid conditions - MDF. HLS type. Thin MDF board, glued to a thick MDF board, must be resistant to water or be an HDF fibreboard...|$|R

50|$|A <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> can be {{built into}} the can wall, or rather the can wall is built around the frame. The process {{involves}} initially having a <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> set in place (on the foundation) and stacking cans {{to either side of}} the frame until they reach the other walls of the building and the ceiling. The <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> is fastened to the tin can wall by hammering nails partially {{into the side of the}} frame that will touch the tin can wall and allowing the concrete to harden around the nails. Short strips of metal lath are also attached to the frame and folded out (perpendicular to the frame) and allowed to set in the can/concrete matrix.|$|R

Also unusual were the windows in the rear doors that opened fully into the <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> {{to the point where they}} disappeared, despite the intrusion into the <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> of a wheel arch which must have made the fit of the window when opened very marginal.|$|R
5000|$|Electric strikes (also called {{electric}} latch release) {{replace a}} standard strike {{mounted on the}} <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> and receive the latch and latch bolt. Electric strikes can be simplest to install when they are designed for one-for-one drop-in replacement of a standard strike, but some electric strike designs require that the <b>door</b> <b>frame</b> be heavily modified. Installation of a strike into a fire listed door (for open backed strikes on pairs of <b>doors)</b> or the <b>frame</b> must be done under listing agency authority, if any modifications to the frame are required (mostly for commercial <b>doors</b> and <b>frames).</b> In the US, {{since there is no}} current Certified Personnel Program to allow field installation of electric strikes into fire listed door openings, listing agency field evaluations would most likely require the <b>door</b> and <b>frame</b> to be de-listed and replaced.|$|R
