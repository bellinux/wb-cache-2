40|$|AbstractMagnetoencephalography (MEG) {{recordings}} {{were collected}} {{to investigate the}} effect of the number of mechanical pins and inter-pin distance on somatosensory evoked magnetic fields (SEFs) following mechanical stimulation (MS). We used a 306 -ch whole-head MEG system. SEFs were elicited through tactile stimuli with 1 -, 2 -, 3 -, 4 - and 8 -pins using healthy participants. Tactile stimuli were applied to the tip of the right index finger. SEF following electrical stimulation of the index finger was recorded in order to compare the activity in the primary somatosensory cortex (S 1) following MS. Prominent SEFs were recorded from the contralateral hemisphere approximately 54 ms (P 50 m) and 125 ms (P 100 m) after MS regardless of the number of pins. Equivalent current dipoles were located in the S 1. The <b>source</b> <b>activities</b> <b>for</b> P 50 m and P 100 m significantly increased in tandem with the number of pins for MS. However, the increased ratios <b>for</b> the <b>source</b> <b>activities</b> according to {{the increase in the number}} of pins were significantly smaller than that induced by electrical stimulation, and when the number of the pins doubled from 1 -pin to 2 -pins, from 2 -pins to 4 -pins, and from 4 -pins to 8 -pins, S 1 activities increased by only 130 %. Additionally, <b>source</b> <b>activities</b> significantly increased when the inter-pin distance increased from 2. 4 to 7. 2 mm.

40|$|A {{difficult}} task with many particle detectors focusing on interactions below ~ 100 keV is {{to perform a}} calibration in the appropriate energy range that adequately probes all regions of the detector. Because detector response can vary greatly in various locations within the device, a spatially uniform calibration is important. We present a new method for calibration of liquid xenon (LXe) detectors, using the short-lived 83 m-Kr. This source has transitions at 9. 4 and 32. 1 keV, and as a noble gas like Xe, it disperses uniformly in all regions of the detector. Even <b>for</b> low <b>source</b> <b>activities,</b> {{the existence of the}} two transitions provides a method of identifying the decays that is free of background. We find that at decreasing energies, the LXe light yield increases, while the amount of electric field quenching is diminished.

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of commercial companies are using online reverse auctions <b>for</b> their <b>sourcing</b> <b>activities.</b> In reverse auctions, multiple suppliers bid for a contract from a buyer for selling goods and/or services. Usually, the buyer has to procure multiple items, which are typically divided into lots for auctioning purposes. By steering {{the composition of the}} lots, a buyer can increase the attractiveness of its lots for the suppliers, which can then make more competitive offers, leading to larger savings for the procuring party. In this paper, a clustering-based heuristic lotting method is proposed for reverse auctions. Agglomerative clustering is used for determining the items that will be put in the same lot. A suitable metric is defined, which allows the procurer to incorporate various approaches to lotting. The proposed lotting method has been tested for the procurement activities of a consumer packaged goods company. The results indicate that the proposed strategy leads to 2 - 3 % savings, while the procurement experts confirm that the lots determined by the proposed method are acceptable given the procurement goals...|$|R

The discipline of economics has traditionally been devoted to the study of markets and market mechanisms. The fundamental lesson learned from economics is that even small changes in the exchange mechanisms can have considerable impact on the outcome. Stated differently, if the market engineer intends to attain a certain mechanism outcome (e. g., efficiency, fairness, revenue maximization), he can define the mechanism {{in a way that it}} induces the right incentives for market participants to act as desired in order to achieve the envisioned outcome. Unfortunately, a comprehensive system that combines all relevant design aspects into one single knowledge-based decision support system is missing. The main contribution of this paper is to develop such a system that guides the design of procurement mechanisms by prescribing mechanism formats using an adapted case-based reasoning algorithm.
