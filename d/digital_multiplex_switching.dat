50|$|The SP-1 {{design was}} {{superseded}} by the DMS-100 {{central office switch}} {{and other members of}} the DMS family of products (DMS: <b>digital</b> <b>multiplex</b> <b>switch).</b> DMS extended the technology by fully integrating switching and transmission. This was a major advance that changed the way systems were built.|$|R
5000|$|The DMS name {{arose from}} a {{designation}} for a switching matrix design {{that was developed}} in the exploratory phase of the project. The <b>Digital</b> <b>Multiplexed</b> <b>Switch</b> was selected as the basic switching design for the project. The product was intended as a successor for Nortel's first electronic switch the SP1 and was to be called the SP2. However the DMS acronym was mellifluous and was eventually (1975) adopted as the designation for the DMS-10 and DMS-100 family of products, with the [...] "S" [...] standing for [...] "system" [...] rather than [...] "switch". It was then applied to the entire digital switching family as well as the DMS-1 family of Digital Transmission Concentrators.|$|R

It is located 1800 metres {{west of the}} boundary between Toronto and Mississauga, serving a major international airport (in Mississauga) and that airport's hotel strip (directly across the town line, therefore in Toronto).

40|$|Abstract. Telemetering {{power supply}} and {{distribution}} system {{is an important}} part of the telemetry system. Arming at a telemetering power supply and distribution system, this paper adopts <b>digital</b> multimeter and <b>multiplex</b> <b>switch</b> based on PXI bus to realize 32 -channel power supply and distribution DC voltage signal acquisition, storage, real-time monitoring and analysis, and also automatic data interpretation. The system consists of PXI host, <b>multiplex</b> <b>switch,</b> <b>digital</b> multimeter, interface unit, a control software and so on, which has the advantages of high precision, high efficiency, easy to operate, and has been used successfully in the test of a telemetry system...|$|R
5000|$|Each {{line module}} unit {{converts}} analogue signals from {{a maximum of}} 64 subscriber lines in the access network to the 64 kilobit/s digital binary signals used in the core network. This is done by sampling the incoming signal {{at a rate of}} 8 kS/s and coding each sample into an 8-bit word using pulse code modulation (PCM) techniques. The line module also strips out any signalling information from the subscriber line, e.g., dialled digits, and passes this to the control unit. Up to 32 line modules are connected to a digital concentrator switch unit using 2 Mbit/s paths, giving each concentrator a capacity of up to 2048 subscriber lines. The <b>digital</b> concentrator <b>switch</b> <b>multiplexes</b> the signals from the line modules using time-division multiplexing and concentrates the signals onto 30 time slots on up to 32-channel high speed paths for connection to the digital local switching unit via the digital line termination units. The other two time slots on each channel are used for synchronisation and signalling.|$|R
