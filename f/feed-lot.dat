50|$|Burns was a {{major force}} behind the growth of {{ranching}} in Alberta. He purchased large herds of purebred Hereford stock, which he used to help fellow ranchers improve the blood lines of their own cattle. A pioneer of cold-weather ranching, Burns put up 250,000 tons of hay for winter feed, and convinced other ranchers to utilize winter feeding methods themselves. He renovated the corrals and feeding pens on his ranches, and also introduced modern <b>feed-lot</b> techniques to finish cattle for market.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{light of}} concern over {{possible}} public health consequences {{arising from the}} use of antibiotics in the animal industries, we examine the willingness of beef-cattle <b>feed-lot</b> veterinarians to forgo the recommendation of antibiotic mass treatment to their beef-feed-lot clients as a contingency based on the dem-onstration of a definite harm to human health. We explore this contingency {{as an example of the}} negotiation by health professionals of conflicting obligations to public health, animal well-being, and the economic pressures of <b>feed-lot</b> medi-cine. We base our study on survey data (n= 103) collected from a national sample of U. S. <b>feed-lot</b> veterinary practitioners. Factors that predict willingness are pri-marily psycho-social, including social influence, moral duty, and trust or distrust, characterized as competency. We define the dimensions of trust across an array of salient others determined by the structural and regulatory context of the Ameri-can cattle feeding industry...|$|E
40|$|Sheep {{husbandry}} in the United States may {{be divided}} {{in a general}} way into three classifications-farm flocks, the range sheep business, and the feeding industry. From the standpoint of the control of disease, the important diseases and the methods of control differ in these three main subdivisions of the industry, although of course there are many disease problems that are common to all sheep operations. Although the diseases of major significance in the range states differ to some extent from those of the feeding and farm flock areas, a very large percentage of the sheep produced in the range states sooner or later lands in the <b>feed-lots</b> or farm flocks of the central states. The wether lambs and part of the ewe lambs from the range are shipped to the <b>feed-lots.</b> The range breeders sell their 6 -year-old ewes either into the <b>feed-lots</b> or to the farm as breeders. Therefore, the feeders and farmers of the corn country are concerned with the health of the sheep of the range country...|$|R
40|$|Emissions of C- and N-derived trace gases from agriculture-related {{activities}} {{have a significant}} influence on the nation’s air quality. Approximately 80 different crop species are grown in the US in widely differing geographic areas and climatic conditions. Other crop growth regulating factors consist of differences in soil types, moisture availability, nutrients and management practices. The crops grown include both C 3 and C 4 species, and a multitude of cultivars. Although the majority of cultivated acreage in the US is planted with only about ten major crop species, uncertainties associated with trace gas emissions arise from: (1) limited data availability and consequently inaccurate estimates due to the large temporal and spatial variability in trace gas (principally CO 2, CH 4, NH 3 and N 2 O) composition and amounts released from agricultural activities, (2) characteristics of pollutant emissions from animal <b>feed-lots</b> (including emissions from dairy animals) and their geographic distribution and (3) our limited understanding of semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) associated with agriculture. SVOCs range in their composition from relatively simple acids to complex organo-chlorines and pesticides. These compounds exist in both particle (solid and liquid) and gas phases, with a highly variable rate of transition from one phase to the other, as governed by their chemical structure, recepto...|$|R
30|$|European Union {{legislation}} [69] specifies {{framework for}} post-market monitoring of GM plant material, to ensure traceability of individual <b>feed-lots</b> entering the European common market. This is important, as only such traceability through proper labeling {{will ensure that}} possible adverse effects from specific harvests or specific batches of feed can be identified. At present the USA, {{which is the largest}} market for genetically modified food for human consumption, has a lack of such traceability. In the USA, this situation has been established through commercial and political influence. Contrary to this, European legislation accommodates traceability of feed for industrial scale production of farmed animals, such as pigs, poultry and cattle. This traceability, however, is not enforced at present. It has been claimed that such a deductive approach to material quality of GM crops would be unfeasible [22]. Contrary to this {{it can be argued that}} labeling and traceability should be used systematically in enforced post-market monitoring. Especially as this systematic approach allows for efficient identification of possible adverse effects from novel feed ingredients following large-scale introduction. In guidance documents for risk assessment of food and feed from GM plants, EFSA has specifically stated the need for post-market monitoring of “undesirable substances” [70] thus flagging a clearly defined regulatory intension. Based on the findings on potentially high residue levels reported here, it is recommended that EFSA gives priority to implementing the existing regulation.|$|R

40|$|Lameness {{has long}} {{been one of the}} three major {{economic}} disorders, particularly in dairy cattle. Thin soles, excessive wear of the soles, are only one reason for lameness. Their occurrence varies from farm to farm. Outbreaks may occur on intensively managed dairy farms, particularly on pasture-based systems. However, the disorder has been recognised in housed dairy and <b>feed-lotted</b> beef patients. Typically, thin soles are seen in dairy patients in early lactation exposed to wet conditions at claw level and long walking distances. Abrasive material/s on the walking surfaces and feeding platforms usually speed up the process of excessive wear. Excessive sole wear may be expected in new or re-concreted milking parlours and yards. The new concrete is very abrasive. In such situations, {{more than half of the}} herd may develop lameness within a few weeks from exposure to the new/re-concreted area (popularly referred to as ‘New concrete disease’). Early signs of thin soles include a slow, painful gait. The walking is often described as ‘walking on egg shells’. Milk production is lowered at individual patient and group level occurs. On clinical examination the dorsal wall of the claw is short and the sole is flexible on a thumb pressure. Haemorrhages in all claw zones may be present. The incidence of sole ulcers, white line disease, toe ulcers, subsolar abscess and osteitis of the third phalanx is often increased. The control should aim to prevent excessive wear, early detection of the affected patients and improve the claw horn quality. This article discusses the thin soles disorder not addressing that caused by over-trimming. Kiro Petrovsk...|$|R
40|$|Since 2000, five {{different}} serotypes (1, 2, 4, 9, 16) of Bluetongue virus (BTV), {{a member of}} the genus Orbivirus within the family Reoviridae, have been actively circulating in Italy in animal species which are sensitive to the infection. Several regions in Southern and Central Italy have been involved in this epidemic. From 2006 to date, serious epidemic waves of a different serotype of BTV (serotype 8) have also occurred in Central-Northern Europe. In 2007, more than 12, 000 outbreaks were recorded in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Luxembourg and Germany. Every year, Italy, particularly the Veneto Region, imports several hundred thousands cattle for the restocking of <b>feed-lots</b> from these countries. In particular, in 2007 the Veneto Region imported about 420, 000 cattle from France. From 26 October 2007 to 26 February 2008, 33 of these animals, introduced to 15 different meat-cattle holdings in the Region, were found to be seropositive to BTV- 8 (30 of these bovines were also PCR positive). This new epidemiological situation has focussed the attention on strengthening the BT surveillance system in this Region, in order to early detect any introduction of BTV- 8 and put proper sanitary measures into place to limit the possible spread of infection. The aim {{of the present study was}} to identify the geographical areas most exposed to the risk of virus introduction and spread in Veneto, in order to target monitoring activities in those areas. An Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis was carried out using MCM (Multiple Criteria Method) system. The analysis took into consideration the sampling scheme applied in BT surveillance programme and BT risk factors. Data on importation of cattle from areas at risk where active virus circulation was detected, density of dairy and meat cattle, and the presence and density of vectors. The application of MCM system allowed the identification of three different areas exposed to a higher risk of BTV- 8 introduction...|$|R

A further objective in this study was to secure information relative to the importance of different causes of death in these groups. Other factors such as rations fed, use of pastures, length of feeding period and other management practices may also be important factors affecting death risk. Advisor:William J. Loeffe...|$|E

30|$|In the 1970 s, {{different}} actors (government, NGOs, {{and private}} groups) {{began a series}} of actions to develop the goat milk cheese industry as the best option to promote the region’s rural development. None of the efforts prospered for different reasons. In the early 1970 s a plant with an installed capacity of forty thousand litres a day was built with government aid in Villa de Hidalgo, another municipality in the San Luis Potosí highlands. It operated for four years but had to be abandoned because of bad administration and political reasons. Several small plants obtained by different producer organizations with government aid in different communities of the highlands have failed because of disputes among their associates. In the mid 1990 s, Desarrollo Rural, an NGO, collected milk from communities and produced French-style goat cheese but failed for lack of quality control and marketing channels. The same NGO collected milk in the highland communities from 1994 to 1998 and successfully sold it to a candy company until a new administration arrived. After 2000, different private groups started cheese production and commercialization businesses with their own <b>feed-lot</b> flocks of goats, but failed because of problems in marketing.|$|E
40|$|This {{study used}} {{spectral}} analysis in 2 separate experiments to examine feeding and ly-ing behavior of Bos taurus steers under 2 housing treatments: a feedlot yard stocked at 12. 0 m 2 per {{head with a}} dry, firm pen surface (NDF) and a “high density ” (HDF) <b>feed-lot</b> yard stocked at 6. 0 m 2 per head with a wet and muddy feedlot pen surface. The study conducted 1 experiment in Autumn, another in Spring. The study measured and analyzed ambient temperatures, relative humidity, and barometric pressure half-hourly onsite, using time series cross-correlations to determine whether steer be-havior was associated with them. Both NDF and HDF groups showed similar lying and eating duration. HDF steers exhibited patterns of lying and feeding {{different from those of}} NDF steers. Spring observations found a number of correlations with temper-ature, relative humidity, and barometric pressure. Health and production data showed no differences between treatments. The results indicate that cattle made successful, short-term changes to changed feedlot environmental conditions. However, confirm-ing these findings requires further replication. Spectral analysis was shown to be sen-sitive enough to detect behavioral differences between treatments and thus has poten-tial animal welfare assessment tool.

40|$|This review {{describes}} {{some circumstances}} where endotoxins of Gram negative bacteria {{may be related}} to the pathogenesis of some common production diseases. Decisive evidence for the pathogentical role of endotoxins remains scarce, and therefore an interdisciplinary background covering epidemiological, biological, biochemical, clinical and experimental aspects is given. Several authors have suggested that endotoxins play a significant role for the development of diseases such as laminitis, abomasal displacement, sudden death syndrome of <b>feed-lot</b> steers ect. While the biological, biochemical and clinical pictures of bovine endotoxicosis is quite well known, and certainly may resemble the clinical and biochemical pictures seen in some of the before mentioned diseases, it is however still not clear how or when endotoxins would gain parenteral access. This review describes excerpts of the biology of endotoxins, key clinical signs and the biochemistry associated to these. It is described how ruminal acidosis may facilitate the translocation of endotoxin from the intestinal/ruminal contents to the portal and eventually the systemic bloodstream. The function of the liver hence becomes central, and the role of hepatic fatty infiltration around parturition is discussed. The review finally suggest that acute ruminal acidosis may be viewed as an analogue to the human syndrome Gut-Derived Infectious Toxic Shock (GITS), where shock is propagated primarily by the translocation of bacterial endotoxin from the gut. </p...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To {{develop and}} {{validate}} high throughput methods for the direct enumeration of viable and culturable Salmonella and Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 in ground beef, carcass, hide and faecal (GCHF) samples from cattle. Methods and Results: The hydrophobic grid membrane filtration (HGMF) method and the spiral plate count method (SPCM) were evaluated as rapid tools for {{the estimation of}} pathogen load using GCHF samples spiked with known levels of Salmonella serotype Typhimurium. Validation studies showed that for a single determination of each sample type {{the low end of}} the detection limits were approx. 2 · 0 × 100 CFU g- 1 for ground beef, 5 · 0 × 10 - 1 CFU (100 cm 2) - 1 for Salmonella and 8 · 0 × 10 - 1 CFU (100 cm 2) - 1 for E. coli O 157 :H 7 on carcasses, 4 · 0 × 101 CFU (100 cm 2) - 1 for hide and 2 · 0 × 102 CFU g- 1 for faecal samples. In addition, ground beef (n = 609), carcass (n = 1520) and hide (n = 3038) samples were collected from beef-processing plants and faecal samples (n = 3190) were collected from <b>feed-lot</b> cattle, and these samples were tested for the presence of Salmonella and E. coli O 157 :H 7 by enrichment and enumeration methods. Conclusions: The direct enumeration methods described here are amenable to high throughput sample processing and were found to be cost-effective alternatives to other enumeration methods for the estimation of Salmonella and E. coli O 157 :H 7, in samples collected during cattle production and beef processing.
