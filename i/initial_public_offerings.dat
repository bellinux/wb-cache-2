25|$|Another {{approach}} {{to measure the}} marketability discount is to compare the prices of stock offered in <b>initial</b> <b>public</b> <b>offerings</b> (IPOs) to transactions in the same company's stocks prior to the IPO.

25|$|The {{earliest}} form of {{a company}} which issued public shares {{was the case of}} the publicani during the Roman Republic. Like modern joint-stock companies, the publicani were legal bodies independent of their members whose ownership was divided into shares, or partes. There is evidence that these shares were sold to public investors and traded in a type of over-the-counter market in the Forum, near the Temple of Castor and Pollux. The shares fluctuated in value, encouraging the activity of speculators, or quaestors. Mere evidence remains of the prices for which partes were sold, the nature of <b>initial</b> <b>public</b> <b>offerings,</b> or a description of stock market behavior. Publicani lost favor with the fall of the Republic {{and the rise of the}} Empire.|$|E
25|$|Some {{specific}} requirements {{were introduced to}} achieve the 30% Bumiputra equity target set by the NEP. Amongst these was a requirement that all <b>initial</b> <b>public</b> <b>offerings</b> (IPOs) set aside a 30% share for Bumiputra investors. These investors could be selected by the company being listed on the stock exchange, or the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which would normally recommend such state-owned trust agencies as Permodalan Nasional or the Armed Forces pension fund. These shares were initially heavily discounted, as IPO prices were often significantly lower than prices after the listing had taken place. However, this advantage has disappeared in recent years. Nevertheless, this regulation has been criticised, especially as the 30% target continues to apply after the IPO has occurred; if the Bumiputra investors divest their shares, the company must issue new shares to maintain the proportion of Bumiputra shares above 30%.|$|E
25|$|Initial public {{offering}} (IPO) or {{stock market launch}} {{is a type of}} {{public offering}} in which shares of a company usually are sold to institutional investors that in turn, sell to the general public, on a securities exchange, for the first time. Through this process, a privately held company transforms into a public company. <b>Initial</b> <b>public</b> <b>offerings</b> are mostly used by companies to raise the expansion of capital, possibly to monetize the investments of early private investors, and to become publicly traded enterprises. A company selling shares is never required to repay the capital to its public investors. After the IPO, when shares trade freely in the open market, money passes between public investors. Although IPO offers many advantages, there are also significant disadvantages, chief among these are the costs associated with the process and the requirement to disclose certain information that could prove helpful to competitors. The IPO process is colloquially known as going public.|$|E
