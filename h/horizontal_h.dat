50|$|As a {{practical}} consequence, at the receiving site the two streams are received with a residual mutual interference. In many practical cases, especially for high-level M-QAM modulations, the communication system cannot tolerate the experienced levels of cross-polarization interference and an improved suppression is necessary. The two received polarizations at the antenna outputs, normally linear <b>horizontal</b> <b>H</b> and vertical V, are routed each to a receiver whose baseband output is further processed by an ad-hoc cross-polarization cancelling scheme, commonly implemented as a digital stage. The XPIC algorithm attains the correct reconstruction of H by summing V to H to cancel any residual interference, and vice-versa.|$|E

30|$|Polarization, {{together}} with the amplitude, time, frequency, phase, and bearing descriptor of radar signals, completes the information description of target returns from radars. The exploitation {{of information on the}} echo polarization can provide a significant improvement on radar performance [1]. To obtain the target polarimetric scattering information, conventional polarimetric radar systems alternately switch (or simultaneously transmit) the <b>horizontal</b> (<b>H)</b> and vertical (V) polarizations at the transmission side, and simultaneously receive both polarizations at the reception side, consequently resulting in four polarization combinations: HH, HV, VH, and VV polarizations.|$|E

40|$|Different {{antenna systems}} were tested for both {{horizontal}} and vertical directivity on this wavelength at distances of from 7 to 30 miles. The antennas used in these experiments included parabolic antenna, V-type, double V-type, Adcock antennas, etc. Using an Adcock antenna the azimuth of the incoming electromagnetic wave can be defined within one half degree accuracy, and with a slight modification of the receiving elements to form a <b>horizontal</b> <b>H</b> antenna, the vertical angle of the incoming wave can also be obtained with {{the same degree of}} accuracy. The former antenna can be converted into the latter by mechanical means within a few seconds and thus both vertical and horizontal angles can be measured with the same antenna set-up. With the antenna one and a half wavelengths above the ground and with the ground surface homogeneous in the immediate vicinity of the receiving antenna, the direction of the incoming electromagnetic wave coincides with that of the transmitter emitting the wave, with in the same accuracy of one half degree. Deviations from the true directions at different locations and at different times were observed. A simple theory of reception of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>H</b> and the Adcock antennas were also given. The receiver used for this experiment is a superheterodyne receiver specially designed for this purpose using a resistance-coupled I-F ampligier. It is very stable in operation and has ample sensitivity. </p...|$|E
