25|$|Additional damage {{occurred}} about 50 miles (80km) southeast in Anaheim as {{the scoreboard}} at Anaheim Stadium collapsed onto several hundred seats. The stadium was vacant at the time. Although several commercial buildings also collapsed, {{loss of life}} was minimized because <b>of</b> the <b>early</b> <b>morning</b> <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> the quake, and because it also occurred on a federal holiday (Martin Luther King, Jr. Day). Also, because of known seismic activity in California, area building codes dictate that buildings incorporate structural design intended to withstand earthquakes. However, the damage caused revealed that some structural specifications did not perform as intended. Because of these revelations, building codes were revised. Some structures were not red-tagged until months later, because damage was not immediately evident.|$|R
