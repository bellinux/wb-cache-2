40|$|Abstract — An auction-based {{process is}} {{proposed}} that allows power market participants to acquire and reconfigure financial transmission rights. The process simultaneously accommodates <b>flowgate</b> and point-to-point options and obligations, along with energy {{production and consumption}} futures. A sequence of auctions is held during which participants can buy and sell rights, culminating in a real-time auction, at which time all rights are cashed out. By allowing <b>flowgate</b> and point-to-point obligations and options to be reconfigured and exchanged, the market can decide what combination of financial rights are most useful to power generators, consumers, and traders. Rights can be exchanged not only for capacity of individual flowgates, but also for more complex transmission constraints, such as nomograms. Under certain conditions, we prove that the auction is revenue adequate for the market operator, in that payments to rights holders cannot exceed congestion revenues. We present a linearized (DC) auction along with a numerical illustration...|$|E
40|$|The paper extends our {{previous}} analysis of market incompleteness {{to the case}} where there exist both a forward and real time market. The discussion is conducted with reference to a two-stage framework commonly used in stochastic programming and finance, but also familiar to the power industry. The paper considers two market designs. The first organization assumes that physical transmission services are auctioned in the forward market. The second organization supposes a financial market of transmission services. We recover the known perfect hedging property of nodal pricing and show that the <b>flowgate</b> model does not share this property. A standard proposition in finance is that market completeness requires {{that the number of}} tradable instruments is equal to or exceeds the number of risk factors. We show that none of the nodal or <b>flowgate</b> models satisfy this property. Other instruments, of the option type, should thus be introduced in these systems in order t...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{surveys the}} markets for {{financial}} transmission rights (FTRs) around the world. FTRs {{are used to}} hedge {{the costs associated with}} transmission congestion. Currently these rights are in use in PJM, New York and New England. A variant of financial transmission rights, which has both a physical and a financial aspect, was introduced in California in 2000. Similarly, <b>flowgates</b> were introduced in Texas in 2002. FTRs are also planned for introduction in New Zealand. The features of the FTRs and the design of the different FTR markets are described. The paper focuses on how FTRs can be acquired, their advantages and disadvantages, and their market performance.

The approach identifies critical lines that can initiate cascading line outages and identifies the optimal location and amount for series compensation.

40|$|Abstract—This paper compares {{methods for}} {{converting}} system limits into market signals. One classification of methods is according to reliability driven (TLR and similar) versus market driven (LMP and similar) methods. A second classification is according to direct versus indirect methods. Direct methods deal with individual limits and constraints. Indirect methods include various ways of converting {{one type of}} limit to another, equivalent limit for purposes of making {{the handling of the}} limit more expeditious. An example of an indirect method is the conversion of a voltage limit to either a flow limit or an interface limit. Another example is the use of flow limits on interfaces as surrogates for stability limits. These transformed limits are often represented by nomograms. Conversion of one type of limit to another and the construction of nomograms has the advantage of reducing the problem of imposing system limits within a market context to a “previously solved ” market problem. If a market already has learned how to cope with an import limit into a load pocket, conversion of a voltage limit into a load pocket import limit makes it easy for a market to react and respond to the condition. However, any conversion from one type of limit to another entails an approximation. This paper discusses the nature of some of these approximations.

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} various {{proposals for}} the organization of regional elec-tricity transmission {{in terms of the}} market incompleteness that they may im-plicitly assume. Elementary notions of variational inequalities constitute the analytical tool used throughout the paper. The discussion is conducted with reference to the <b>flowgate</b> debate in the US and European proposals {{for the organization}} of cross border electricity trade. This first part of the paper dis-cusses market incompleteness in the forward (day ahead) market. The main results can be summarized as follows. An energy market without a market for transmission services is incomplete and hence inefficient. The nodal and flow-gate models complete the market when one does not consider contingencies. One can define a notion of transmission capacity (called an extended <b>flowgate)</b> by aggregating line capacities using spot prices. This transmission capacity completes the market and reduces the number of necessary flowgates (possibly to one). But these extended flowgates have variable capacities. As {{in the case of the}} nodal model, extended flowgates can accommodate contingencies in the forward market. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In the {{locational}} {{marginal price}} (LMP) -based congestion management scheme, transmission customers face {{uncertainty in the}} congestion charges they incur. In order to bring certainty to customers, congestion revenue rights (CRR) such as the fixed transmission rights (FTR) used in the PJM interconnection and <b>flowgate</b> rights (FGR) are introduced. These CRR are financial tools that provide the holder reimbursement of the congestion charges incurred in the day-ahead market. The implementation of CRR requires appropriate modeling of the transmission network in which the distribution factors are extensively used. These factors—the injection shift factors (ISFs) and the power transfer distribution factors (PTDFs) —are linear approximations of the sensitivities of the active power line flows with respect to various variables. The factors are computed for a specified network topology and parameter values. In practice, the PTDFs used for the CRR issuance may be different from those used in the day-ahead market due {{to changes in the}} forecasted network conditions. The PTDF errors may impact the FTR issuance quantities, the revenue adequacy of the FTR issuer and the hedging ability of the FGR. In this paper, we explore analytical characteristics of these distribution factors and investigate their role in CRR applications. We study the nature of the PTDF errors and examine their impacts in these applications, both analytically and experimentally. Our results indicate that the impacts of the PTDF errors in CRR applications stay in an acceptable range under a broad spectrum of conditions including contingencies used to establish 1 security.

40|$|Through {{integrated}} {{modeling of}} power system operations and market risks, this thesis addresses {{a variety of}} important issues on market signals modeling, generation capacity scheduling, and electricity forward trading. The {{first part of the}} thesis addresses a central problem of transmission investment which is to model market signals for transmission adequacy. The proposed system simulation framework, combined with the stochastic price model, provides a powerful tool for capturing the characteristics of market prices dynamics and evaluating transmission investment. We advocate the use of an AC power flow formulations instead since it allocates transmission losses correctly and reveals the economic incentives of voltage requirements. By incorporating reliability constraints in the market dispatch, the resulting market prices yield incentives for market participants to invest in additional transmission capacity. The second part of the thesis presents a co-optimization modeling framework that incorporates market participation and market price uncertainties into the capacity allocation decision-making problem through a stochastic programming formulation. Optimal scenario-dependent generation scheduling strategies are obtained. The third part of the thesis is devoted to analyzing the risk premium present in the electricity day-ahead forward price over the real-time spot price. This study establishes a quantitative model for incorporating transmission congestion into the analysis of electricity day-ahead forward risk premium. Evidences from empirical studies confirm the significant statistical relationship between the day-ahead forward risk premium and the shadow price premiums on transmission <b>flowgates.</b> Ph. D.

40|$|The NERC Glossary of Terms [i] {{defines a}} Dynamic Transfer as the {{provision}} of the real-time monitoring, telemetering, computer software, hardware, communications, engineering, energy accounting (including inadvertent interchange), and administration required to electronically move all or {{a portion of the}} real energy services associated with a generator out of one Balancing Authority (BA) Area into another. Dynamic Transfers includes both Dynamic Schedules and Pseudo Ties, which are further defined below. The NERC Glossary of Terms [i] defines a Dynamic Interchange Schedule or Dynamic Schedule as a telemetered reading or value that is updated in real-time and used as a schedule in the Area Control Error (“ACE”) equation and the integrated value of which is treated as a schedule for interchange accounting purposes. Dynamic Interchange Schedules or Dynamic Schedules are commonly used for scheduling jointly owned generation to or from another Balancing Authority Area. The NERC Glossary of Terms [i] defines a Pseudo Tie as a telemetered reading or value that is updated in real-time and used as a “virtual ” tie line flow in the AGC/ACE equation but for which no physical tie or energy metering actually exists. The integrated value is used as a metered MWh value for interchange accounting purposes. The major difference between a Dynamic Schedule and a Pseudo Tie is how they are incorporated within a Balancing Authority’s ACE calculation. A Dynamic Schedule is modeled as an “Interchange Schedule ” and therefore is subject to NERC Tagging requirements [iv][v][ix]. A Pseudo Tie, modeled as a “virtual ” tie, is accounted as actual interchange and requires an adequate level of modeling within the PJM Energy Management System (EMS) and PJM Market Systems depending on the obligations associated from participating in PJM markets and to ensure accurate market flow calculations required to mitigate loading on “market-to-market ” <b>flowgates.</b> Pseudo Ties are not currently subject to NERC Tagging requirements.

Previous research showed a 25 % savings by dispatching the IEEE 118 bus test case. This paper is an extension of that work. It presents how changing the topology affects nodal prices, load payment, generation revenues, cost, and rents, congestion rents, and <b>flowgate</b> prices. Results indicate that changing the topology to cut costs typically results in lower load payments and higher generation rents for this network. Computational issues are also discussed.

The basic {{aim of the}} FTR mechanism is to guard forward contracts from uncertain congestion charges. FTRs are also useful to individual generators and loads for selling and buying power, respectively, at the prices of other locations. The concept has evolved, encompassing many features such as a simultaneous feasibility test, various ways to conduct auctions and allocations and secondary trading. FTRs also have a close relation to market power and transmission investment. This paper reviews most of the landmark research papers {{on the evolution of}} the FTR concept. It reports a comprehensive assessment of various facets of FTRs and allied issues. Financial {{transmission rights}} and <b>flowgate</b> rights (FGRs) are compared.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} transmission side bidding for availing power transmission services through a market mechanism. The transmission side bidding, in essence, refers to the direct market participation of transmission line owners for selling their line capacities with appropriate price offers. The transmission offers are submitted to the centralized auction conducted by the independent system operator for carrying out dispatch scheduling or for the issuance of transmission rights. Those are jointly cleared along with other bids and offers, and bid-consistent prices are established by means of marginal pricing. The uncertainty that gets involved in revenues or payments of market players because of the conventional transmission pricing is, therefore, eliminated. By recognizing the criticality of power flow interactions between different transmission lines, the auction participation of transmission line owners is suitably regulated. The issuance of financial transmission rights (FTRs) is supplemented by assigning counterflow <b>flowgate</b> rights to the transmission line owners so as to ensure revenue adequate FTR settlement. Detailed case studies are performed to verify {{the utility of the}} proposed transmission pricing methodology...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{gives the}} {{background}} and role of the market flow in the interregional congestion management process for market-based operating entity and describes the market flow methodology. It proposes that the market flow method calculates the same impact result on a <b>flowgate</b> as the unit dispatch system (UDS) flow does and proves it mathematically. The equivalence of market flow and UDS flow shows that the UDS flow change on a constraint due to the UDS binding {{will have the same}} effect on the change in the market flow under the electricity market operations. In addition, it proves that, in an interconnected system, the sum of the market flows of all of the market entities, the generation-to-load impacts of nonmarket entities, and the total tagged transaction impact among the entities is equal to the dc flow for any constraint. The assessment of market flow methodology demonstrates the effectiveness of using the market flow in the congestion management process and coordinated management of transmission constraints. The proposed methodology can help identify the cause of loop flow problem in power systems. The numerical results on a 23 -bus test system and a 7917 -bus system are also illustrated...|$|E
40|$|A bstract— In {{this paper}} we discuss the {{infrastructure}} important for proficient management of the network, namely the secondary markets for transmission rights. Following the re:;tructuring process {{the participants in the}} electric power industry are engaging in complex market ac-tivities to meet their electricity needs. Many market partici-pants enter into forward (delivery) contracts for energy. The forward price may be described as the spot market price for delivery of a commodity at a fixed time in the future. As a counterpart to the forward contract marketplace for energy, the secondary market for transmission provides the neces-sary mechanism for supporting the market activities so that the change in value is readily conveyed to all of the market participants of the forward contracts for transmission por-tion of electric services {{in the form of the}} intermediate term transmission contracts. Here the market participants may be the holders of the physical transmission rights, the hold-ers of the financial transmission rights and/or the bidders in the spot market. With the introduction of the secondnry markets for trans-mission rights we can compare the workings for the transmis-sion rights in the form of the intermediate term transmission contracts proposecl in this paper with the transmission con-gestion contracts (TCC) and the <b>flowgate</b> rights.

40|$|Carbon leakage in this pape ris the {{phenomenon}} whereby Electricity Intensive Industries subject to harsh environmental standards move their activity {{or part of}} it to more environmentally lenient regions. Carbon leakage has been mentioned as a possible outcome of the EU Emission Trading Scheme. Different studies are underway to assess the reality of {{the phenomenon}} and to devise policies to mitigate its possible impact. One remedy, proposed by the Energy Intensive Industries is to combine free emission allowances with a pricing of electricity whereby energy emissions and transmission costs are bundled and sold on an average cost basis. The paper attempts to model this proposal. We cast the problem in a spatial model of the power sector where generators can develop new capacities, the transmission system is organized on a <b>flowgate</b> basis, emission allowances are auctioned, except possibly for industries, and traded. The consumer market is decomposed in two segments. Industries purchase electricity according to some form of average cost price, the rest of the market is supplied at marginal cost. These equilibrium models are non convex. We present the models and discuss their properties.
