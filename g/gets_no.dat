5|$|Primary {{growth is}} the {{elongation}} of the stems and roots. Secondary growth {{consists of a}} progressive thickening and strengthening of the tissues as the outer layer of the epidermis is converted into bark and the cambium layer creates new phloem and xylem cells. The bark is inelastic. Eventually {{the growth of a}} tree slows down and stops and it <b>gets</b> <b>no</b> taller. If damage occurs the tree may in time become hollow.|$|E
5|$|A former colonial marshal on the {{backwater}} {{planet of}} Mar Sara, Raynor joins Arcturus Mengsk's revolutionaries in their {{fight against the}} tyrannical and corrupt Confederacy of Man, where he develops a relationship with Sarah Kerrigan, Mengsk's second in command. However, he quickly comes to realise that Mengsk {{is far from the}} force for good when he abandons Kerrigan and the entire population of a planet to die by the hand of the Zerg to satisfy his own thirst for power. Disillusioned and embittered, Raynor deserts Mengsk and becomes a persona non grata in the new Terran Dominion. The situation <b>gets</b> <b>no</b> better when Kerrigan, who was captured by the Zerg, is assimilated into the swarm and becomes one of their most powerful assets. After desertion, Raynor and his forces take part in major combat operations across the sector: He fights alongside the Protoss templar Tassadar in the battle that leads to the fall of the Zerg ruler, the Overmind, and splinters the Zerg into several factions. When the expeditionary forces of United Earth Directorate (UED) arrive in the sector to subjugate it, Raynor, Mengsk and Kerrigan (now calling herself the Queen of Blades) combine their Terran, Zerg and Protoss allies to repel the invasion. No sooner than they fall, the alliance shatters.|$|E

25|$|Its {{publication}} by Adolf Fraenkel in 1922 is {{what makes}} modern set theory Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (ZFC). The axiom was independently discovered and announced by Thoralf Skolem later {{in the same year}} (and published in 1923). Zermelo himself incorporated Fraenkel's axiom in his revised system he published in 1930, which also included as a new axiom von Neumann's axiom of foundation. Although it is Skolem's first order version of the axiom list that we use today, he usually <b>gets</b> <b>no</b> credit since each individual axiom was developed earlier by either Zermelo or Fraenkel. The phrase “Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory” was first used in print by von Neumann in 1928.|$|E
25|$|A player's ranking {{points for}} an event {{must be at least}} 1.2. Players who would get less than this using the above formula get no ranking points. For example, if an event has a ranking of 10 only the leading 12 players (and ties) receive any ranking points since the player in 12th place gets 12% of the event ranking (i.e. 1.2). The player in 13th {{position}} <b>gets</b> <b>no</b> points. Where there is a tie for the final scoring place, those players are guaranteed to receive at least 1.2 points. Using the above example, if there were two or more players tied for 12th place, each would receive 1.2 points. The only exceptions to this system are in the major championships where all players who make the cut get a minimum of 1.5 ranking points.|$|E

500|$|The series premiere {{begins at}} Sunnydale High School, where a boy (played by Carmine Giovinazzo) breaks {{into the school}} during the night with a {{seemingly}} reluctant girl (Julie Benz), promising her mischief and therefore fun. Nervous and on edge, the girl says she thinks she heard something and fears someone is in the school, other than the two of them. The boy calls out but <b>gets</b> <b>no</b> response, leading him to say [...] "it's nothing" [...] to the girl and assure her that they [...] "are alone". The girl says [...] " [...] ok, that's good", after which she turns to face the boy, revealing her facial morph into her true identity; a vampire. She then bites the boy's neck.

Driver pulls out his own knife and fatally stabs Bernie. [...] Driver then abandons the money and leaves. Irene knocks at the Driver's apartment, but <b>gets</b> <b>no</b> response.

500|$|... "God Help the Outcasts" [...] {{was adapted}} {{for the stage}} version of The Hunchback of Notre Dame, which premiered in a 1999 German {{production}} entitled Der Glöckner von Notre Dame. Called Hilf den Verstoß'nen in German, this rendition is a duet between Esmerelda and Quasimodo, and was originally performed by Judy Weiss and Drew Sarich respectively. Stephen Schwartz said [...] "the scene...with all its candles and projected re-creation of Notre Dame, I thought was absolutely stunning". Reviewer Edward R. Cox wrote [...] "The addition of Quasi to this song adds such a world of unity to the pleas of Esmeralda and the parishoners [...] show his pure compassion for other's pain, unselfishly. A brilliant stage device and moment". The Hunchblog noted turning this song into a duet means Esmerelda <b>gets</b> <b>no</b> solos in the musical. In the 2014-5 La Jolla Playhouse/Paper Mill Playhouse English production, the song was reverted to a solo.|$|E

500|$|The {{scene is}} {{the same as that of}} the opening of the opera, in the domain of the Grail, but many years later. Gurnemanz is now aged and bent. It is Good Friday. He hears moaning near his hermit's hut and discovers Kundry {{unconscious}} in the brush, as he had many years before ("Sie! Wieder da!"). He revives her using water from the Holy Spring, but she will only speak the word [...] "serve" [...] ("Dienen"). Gurnemanz wonders if there is any significance to her reappearance on this special day. Looking into the forest, he sees a figure approaching, armed and in full armour. The stranger wears a helmet and the hermit cannot see who it is. Gurnemanz queries him and chides him for being armed on sanctified ground and on a holy day, but <b>gets</b> <b>no</b> response. Finally, the apparition removes the helmet and Gurnemanz recognizes the lad who shot the swan, and joyfully sees that he bears the Holy Spear.|$|E
