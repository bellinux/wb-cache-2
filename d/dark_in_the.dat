5|$|In the novels, Dexter {{initially}} considers Rita {{little more}} than part of his disguise as a normal human being, and the perfect cover for his secret life as a serial killer. He later admits to growing quite fond of Rita, whom he married in the third book, Dexter in the <b>Dark.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> television series, Rita is portrayed as a loving and caring mother who is emotionally damaged due to physical abuse by her former husband, Paul Bennett. Rita {{is the mother of}} Astor Bennett (Christina Robinson) and Cody Bennett (Preston Bailey), and later in the television series, gives birth to Dexter's son, Harrison. In the book series, she and Dexter have a daughter, Lily Anne.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 13 October, Warren sighted two of the French frigates {{standing}} out of Donegal Bay and went after them, directing Moore in Melampus to stay behind to search for stragglers. Hindered by contrary winds, Melampus scoured the bay until well after nightfall, and at 23:30 {{was surprised by the}} sudden appearance directly in front of her of Immortalité and Résolue near St. John's Point. Immortalité soon spotted Melampus and made sail, but Captain Bargeau of Résolue had not seen the British ship, and was hesitant about following his compatriot in the <b>dark.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> gloom and confusion, he mistook Melampus for Immortalité and came alongside, only realising his mistake when Melampus opened fire. Because of the heavy seas, Résolues guns had been tied down below decks, so the only return fire she could offer was from her handful of quarterdeck guns. Bargeau, whose ship was still leaking badly, recognised that further resistance was futile and surrendered in minutes, having lost ten men and much of his rigging. Melampus put aboard a prize crew and then departed in pursuit of Immortalité.|$|E
25|$|Filament {{cavities}} are zones which look <b>dark</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> X-rays and {{are above}} the regions where Hα filaments are {{observed in the}} chromosphere. They were first observed in the two 1970 rocket flights which also detected coronal holes.|$|E

25|$|Ventnor Brewery, which {{closed in}} 2009, {{was the last}} {{incarnation}} of Burt's Brewery, brewing since the 1840s in Ventnor. Until the 1960s most pubs were owned by Mews Brewery, situated in Newport near the old railway station, but it closed and the pubs were taken over by Strong's, and then by Whitbread. By some accounts Mews beer was apt to be rather cloudy and <b>dark.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 19th century they pioneered the use of screw top cans for export to British India.|$|E
25|$|Its wings were {{trapezoidal}} in plan, {{though with}} long, rounded tips. Their thickness reduced outwards, largely from below, {{contributing to the}} significant dihedral. Structurally, the wings were wooden, each with two longerons which were joined into a box spar by plywood skin out to three-quarter span; this appears <b>dark</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> photograph above. The rest of the surfaces, including the unbalanced ailerons which occupied about half the span, were silk covered. The ailerons had frames of elektron, a recently developed magnesium alloy.|$|E

25|$|Argentine youth {{began to}} musically and {{socially}} gravitate {{to either the}} suburban rock groups or towards the underground. And even within these two major groupings there were subdivisions (rolinga and post-chabón in suburban rock; sonico, punk, <b>dark</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> underground). Then there were the heavy metal followers, the large and expanding indie scene, and the tropical rock followers, genre increasingly intermixed with the fledgling Cumbia which would explode in the new millennium.

25|$|About 30 {{seconds before}} {{arriving}} at the crossing, the train trips a track circuit near the crossing, triggering the crossing signals. The lights begin to flash alternately, and a bell (or bells) mounted at the crossing begins ringing. After several seconds of flashing lights and ringing bells, the crossing gates (if equipped) begin to lower, which usually takes 5–10 seconds. Some AWDs silence the bell once the gates are fully lowered (typically seen on most Norfolk Southern and CSX crossings); most continue ringing the bells throughout (Union Pacific, BNSF Railway). Some crossings will not sound the bell at all after <b>dark</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case that it is installed near a residential area. The lights continue to flash throughout regardless.|$|E
25|$|Legendary {{disc jockey}} Bill Crisp {{at one time}} owned the only AM/FM radio {{stations}} licensed to Seaford,WSFD/WSUX. Their studios were located on S. Dual Highway just two miles south of Seaford. WSFD broadcast on a frequency of 1280 AM as a daytime only radio station with 1000 watts of power serving Lower Delaware. Some of its formats included Adult Contemporary and Country. The station went <b>dark</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1990s. WSUX broadcast 3000 watts on a frequency of 98.3 FM and was known as Stereo 98. The station survived years of popularity in the 70s and 80s with a Top 40 format serving Maryland's Eastern Shore and Lower Delaware. The station was later sold and has since switched frequency to 98.5.|$|E

25|$|Histogram {{equalization}} {{is useful}} in enhancing contrast within an image. This technique is used to increase local contrast. At {{the end of the}} processing, areas that were <b>dark</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> input image would be brightened, greatly enhancing the contrast among the features present in the area. On the other hand, brighter areas in the input image would remain bright or be reduced in brightness to equalize with the other areas in the image. Besides vessel segmentation, other features related to diabetic retinopathy can be further separated by using this pre-processing technique. Microaneurysm and hemorrhages are red lesions, whereas exudates are yellow spots. Increasing contrast between these two groups allow better visualization of lesions on images. With this technique, 2014 review found that 10 out of the 14 recently (since 2011) published primary research.|$|E
500|$|The {{most unusual}} {{feature of the}} Michigan-Chicago game on Thanksgiving Day {{was that it was}} played indoors at the Chicago Coliseum and was [...] "the first collegiate game of {{football}} played under a roof." [...] Adding to the novelty, as daylight turned to darkness, the field inside the Coliseum was lit with electric lighting. According to a newspaper account, the field grew <b>dark</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second half, and play was halted for ten minutes to discuss whether play should continue. Play was resumed, and the lights were finally turned on after Michigan scored a touchdown.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the struggles}} that Whedon had with Fox was {{the tone of}} the show, {{especially}} with the main character Malcolm Reynolds. Fox pressured Whedon to make Mal more [...] "jolly", as they feared he was too <b>dark</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> original pilot, epitomized by the moment he suggests he might [...] "space" [...] Simon and River, throwing them out of the airlock to die.

500|$|Murphy {{has said}} that he has never seen a High School Musical film, to which Glee has been compared, and that his {{interest}} lay in creating a [...] "postmodern musical", rather than [...] "doing a show where people burst into song", drawing more heavily on the format of Chicago. Murphy intended the show to be a form of escapism. [...] "There's so much on the air right now about people with guns, or sci-fi, or lawyers running around. This is a different genre, there's nothing like it on the air at the networks and cable. Everything's so <b>dark</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world right now, that's why Idol worked. It's pure escapism," [...] he said. Murphy intended to make a family show to appeal to adults as well as children, with adult characters starring equally alongside the teenage leads, and as of October 2009 he had already mapped out plans for the series covering three years of broadcast.|$|E
500|$|Newsarama's Richard Gray gave Justice League #22 an 8 out of 10. Gray {{stated that}} [...] "Johns does {{a terrific job}} of pulling {{together}} what has been essentially four or five separate stories, incorporating not only the three main titles that this will span over the coming months, but introducing several new players into the mix as well." [...] He also praised that the story advanced and showed similar promise that the reboot to the New 52 did in 2011. Joshua Yehl of IGN gave {{the first chapter of}} the Trinity War a 7.8 out of 10. He felt the issue {{set the stage for the}} event and praised the character work. However, he though that the conflict was not presented clearly yet and criticized the lack of the Justice League <b>Dark</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first issue. Comic Book Resources' Doug Zawisza gave the issue 4 stars out of 5, saying [...] "Johns manages to balance personality expositions with story breaks, giving readers a sense of who the opposing sides are, if nothing else. Johns brings lots of big moments to the pages, but the emotions he wrings from those moments really help sell this book." [...] Zawisza was surprised by the amount of time that was spent on Madame Xanadu, feeling as though it was only there for reason to include the Justice League Dark, and was wary that the characters are in danger of being absorbed by the plot. All three praised the art in the issue, especially Ivan Reis' pencils.|$|E
5000|$|The major {{difference}} between the novel and the anime is <b>the</b> significantly <b>darker</b> tone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> novels. The character of Kazuma is much <b>darker</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> novels, which depicts him mercilessly killing most of <b>the</b> antagonistic characters. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> anime, Kazuma is usually depicted as only injuring or incapacitating his opponents, while their actual deaths are usually the result of their own schemes backfiring on them.

500|$|Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk, and Ian Brennan created Glee. Murphy drew {{inspiration}} from his own childhood, which saw him play the lead role {{in all of his}} high school's musicals. Brennan and producer Mike Novick were also highly involved in their own schools' glee clubs. Brennan originally wrote a script for a Glee movie, but Murphy believed the concept would work better as a TV series. Fox picked up the series pilot within 15 hours of receiving the script, which Murphy attributes in part {{to the success of the}} network's American Idol, commenting: [...] "It made sense for the network with the biggest hit in TV, which is a musical, to do something in that vein". Murphy intended the show to be a form of escapism, explaining: [...] "There's so much on the air right now about people with guns, or sci-fi, or lawyers running around. This is a different genre, there's nothing like it on the air at the networks and cable. Everything's so <b>dark</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world right now, that's why 'Idol' worked. It's pure escapism." [...] With regards to Glee audience, Murphy intended for it to be a family show which would appeal to adults as well as children, with adult characters starring equally alongside the teenage leads. Glee is set in Lima, Ohio. Murphy chose a Midwest setting as he himself originates from Indiana, and recalls childhood visits to Ohio to the Kings Island theme park. Although set in Lima, the show is actually filmed at Paramount Studios in Hollywood.|$|E
500|$|In Darkly Dreaming Dexter, the two {{are already}} together, but it is {{explained}} that Dexter started dating her solely to improve his [...] "disguise" [...] as a normal person. Because she was brutalized by her now-jailed ex-husband, Rita fears intimacy and does not expect much of Dexter; this suits the asexual Dexter perfectly. By the novel's climax, Dexter admits that he is fond of her children, Astor and Cody, the closest he can get to feeling love. By a humorous misunderstanding, the couple become engaged in Dearly Devoted Dexter and married {{at the end of}} Dexter in the <b>Dark.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> books, Rita is scatter-brained and easily upset, prone to speaking in disjointed, rambling sentences that Dexter often finds incomprehensible. The only quality that Dexter truly appreciates about her is that she is an excellent cook. She is a physical fitness buff; she and Dexter regularly go for [...] runs, long bike rides, and weightlifting sessions together. In the fifth book, Dexter is Delicious, she gives birth to Dexter's daughter Lily Anne. In Dearly Devoted Dexter, Dexter discovers that Cody and Astor are budding sociopaths and decides to provide them with the same [...] "guidance" [...] that his adoptive father Harry gave to him; namely, to teach them how to be careful, efficient killers of those who [...] "deserve it". Rita is kept in the dark about the true nature of their relationship. She suspects that something is wrong with the children when she discovers them torturing a cat, but Dexter is able to reassure her that they didn't understand what they were doing. The television series is based on Darkly Dreaming Dexter. In Dexter's Final Cut, Dexter has an affair with TV star Jackie Forrest, and briefly considers leaving Rita. At the end of the novel, however, both Rita and Jackie are murdered by Robert Chase, a pedophile intent on kidnapping Astor.|$|E
500|$|Several minor {{characters}} {{have been removed}} from the film version, most prominent among them the spectral History of Magic teacher, Professor Binns, and Peeves the poltergeist. The book's first chapter is from the viewpoint of Vernon and Petunia Dursley the day before they are given Harry to look after, highlighting how non-magical people react to magic. The film removes this, beginning with Professor Dumbledore, Professor McGonagall and Hagrid leaving Harry with the Dursleys (although McGonagall tells Dumbledore how she had been watching the Dursleys all day). Harry's less than pleasant times at Mrs. Figg's are cut from the film while the boa constrictor from Brazil in the zoo becomes a Burmese Python in the film. Some conflicts, such as Harry and Draco's encounter with each other in Madam Malkin's robe shop and midnight duel, are not in the film. Some of Nicolas Flamel's role is changed or cut altogether. Norbert is mentioned to have been taken away by Dumbledore in the film; whilst the book sees Harry and Hermione have to take him by hand to Charlie Weasley's friends. Rowling described the scene as [...] "the one part of the book that she felt [...] be changed". As such, the reason for the detention in the Forbidden Forest was changed: In the novel, Harry and Hermione are put in detention for being caught by Filch when leaving the Astronomy Tower after hours, Neville and Malfoy are given detention when caught in the corridor by Professor McGonagall. In the film, Harry, Hermione and Ron receive detention after Malfoy catches them in Hagrid's hut after hours (Malfoy however, is given detention for being out of bed after hours). Firenze the centaur, who is described in the book as being palomino with light blonde hair, is shown to be <b>dark</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film. The Quidditch pitch is altered from a traditional stadium to an open field circled by spectator towers.|$|E
