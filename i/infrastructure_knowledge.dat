40|$|To gain a {{competitive}} advantage, a company {{must have the}} ability to effectively manage its chief asset, knowledge. Out of various types of knowledge that firms possess, its ability to satisfy customer requirements plays a crucial role in its ability to provide a quality product/service. More specifically, in information technology (IT) projects, customer requirements need to be effectively and efficiently transferred to the IT department. In return, the IT department must efficiently and effectively meet these needs. This thesis examined the relationship between knowledge management capabilities and knowledge transfer success in IT departments in Canadian companies. An online survey collected empirical data from 54 IT managers. This data was analyzed using the partial least square (PLS) structural equation modeling method. The findings show that for knowledge transfer to be successful in an IT project, the IT department must have both a solid <b>knowledge</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and a <b>knowledge</b> process capability. Within these capabilities, key <b>infrastructure</b> factors and <b>knowledge</b> processes were identified. Application and Acquisition proved to be significant in ensuring a solid process infrastructure, while Culture of Learning, Culture of Sharing, Collaboration Technology, Opportunity Generation Technology, Structure that supports Collaboration and System of Rewards were found to be important infrastructure elements. Furthermore, the findings reveal that knowledge processes are key to ensuring knowledge transfer efficiency, but not necessarily effectiveness; while <b>knowledge</b> <b>infrastructure</b> determines <b>knowledge</b> transfer effectiveness, but not necessarily efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Knowledge {{management}} {{has become one}} of the most important trends in business, yet many knowledge management initiatives fail. To understand the success and failure of knowledge management, firms must identify and assess the organizational capabilities required for the effort to prosper, which is the focus of this study. Literature has offered important theoretical grounding for this study with regard to organizational capability as a predictor of knowledge management effectiveness, but empirical examination is lacking. The organizational capabilities have been identified as <b>knowledge</b> <b>infrastructure</b> capability (consisting of cultural, structural, and technological) and knowledge process capability (consisting of knowledge acquisition, conversion, application, and protection). The research model was adopted from Gold, Malhotra, and Segars (2001). This research broke new ground in the field of knowledge management by examining the relationships between <b>knowledge</b> <b>infrastructure</b> capability, <b>knowledge</b> process capability, and organizational effectiveness from the dual perspective of the team (within business units) in contrast to the organization (across business units). Organizations develop <b>knowledge</b> <b>infrastructure</b> to drive desired behaviors, yet knowledge workers develop processes to circumvent the organization 2 ̆ 7 s infrastructure (cultural and structural barriers). This may contribute to the problem of knowledge management failure. However, the relationships between <b>knowledge</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and <b>knowledge</b> processes have not been empirically examined, until this study. In addition, most knowledge management research is conducted at the organization level, yet most knowledge management implementation occurs at the team level (project teams, business units, social groups). To help bridge the gaps between theory and practice, this study aligned the unit of analysis more closely with the practitioners 2 ̆ 7 level of implementation. Using only the organization as the unit of analysis would provide little guidance for business leaders in how they can influence the success of knowledge management programs, and it would present an incomplete picture when assessing the relationships between organizational capabilities and knowledge management effectiveness. The organization perspective helps with generalizability of this study, while the team perspective leads to results of a more informative and prescriptive nature for practitioners. Because the field of knowledge management is driven by practical need, this study offers many important managerial implications. Data was collected from several business units of a Fortune 100 multinational firm, and assessed using Structural Equation Modeling. The structural models were developed to test the hypothesized relationships and answer the research questions. As a result, this research provides empirical evidence that knowledge management capabilities are a contributing factor of organizational effectiveness. In addition, it can be concluded that firms with superior absorptive capacity and knowledge integration processes will improve their knowledge management capability. The results of this study include the findings that <b>knowledge</b> <b>infrastructure</b> drives <b>knowledge</b> processes, that organization-level knowledge processes drive team-level knowledge processes, and that knowledge protection is seen as a corporate responsibility rather than a team or individual responsibility. Overall, the findings conform to the literature and lend credibility to Gold et al. 2 ̆ 7 s (2001) theory that effective knowledge management, as measured by its impact on organizational performance, is dependent on the firm 2 ̆ 7 s <b>knowledge</b> <b>infrastructure</b> capability and <b>knowledge</b> process capability...|$|R

For companies like AstraZeneca where research {{is one of the}} corner stones there must be an easy way for accessing and sharing knowledge. To be able to meet these demands organizations have to rely intensively on a stable and welldesigned <b>knowledge</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> In this masters thesis we study one of AstraZeneca’s knowledge sources named AZ Glossary. We investigate how it works as a <b>knowledge</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and how it can be improved to better spread knowledge {{to the people in the}} organization. A problem for AstraZeneca today is that the information in the glossary is not machine processable, which means that the information cannot be easily used by other programs and applications. This structure limits the utilization of the glossary and is therefore also affecting the <b>knowledge</b> <b>infrastructure</b> in a less satisfactory way. An ethnographic study based on in-depth interviews with key users and administrators of the glossary was used for mapping AZ Glossary and its organization and usage. An examination of the semantic technologies including languages as XML, RDF (Resource Description Framework) and SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System) was carried out in our search to improve the glossary.
