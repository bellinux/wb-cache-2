In 1981, The New York Times noted that two of Sowell's books, Markets and Minorities and Ethnic America, [...] "have just been published, to much praise from fellow conservatives and a lot of criticism, some of it bitter, from fellow blacks and from liberal intellectuals." [...] Bernadette Chachere, an economist at Hampton University, criticized Markets and Minorities for ignoring past economic research on income disparities between races: [...] "To cite one article published in 1973, after controlling for age, region of residence, parents' income, father's occupation and education, place where raised, number of siblings, health, local labor, market conditions, <b>geographic</b> <b>mobility,</b> and seasonal employment, there still remained a 70% difference in the earnings of whites and nonwhites unexplained... the lack of such a [...] review does preclude Sowell's claim to a monopoly on 'rigorous' analysis.

2500|$|In the 1920s, the New Negro Movement {{represented}} a [...] "race-conscious, assertive, race-proud" [...] generation of Black Americans who rejected White paternalism and White run Black colleges. The growing prominence of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association, and the Niagara Movement helped foment Black discontent with prevailing social conditions. Black soldiers, after fighting {{for democracy in}} World War I, returned home and resented the lack of democratic processes afforded them. Increased Black <b>geographic</b> <b>mobility,</b> especially to the North, and better economic opportunities furthered feelings of Black empowerment. Social changes in broader U.S. society also contributed to growing Black self-determination. Throughout the 1920s, the United States experienced what one historian characterized as a, [...] "revolution in morals and manners," [...] especially among both White and Black youth. The religious piety that had long served {{as a basis for}} personal and social customs gave way to motivations for pleasure, wealth, and the nouveau. Emerging technologies such as the automobile, motion pictures, and musical recordings combined with bold new expressions in women's fashion and behavior that seeded growing antagonism toward outdated and overly conservative aspects of life. Improvements in dissemination of news and culture provided many Blacks views of the world outside the South. The rise of Harlem, New York, as the capital of Black America and the flowering of Negro arts, including music and literature, attracted considerable attention among Blacks and Whites. Black advancement on so many different fronts encouraged Black youth to throw off the shackles of compromise and accommodation and boldly assert the rights and privileges promised them as citizens of the United States. There was a White backlash to New Negro movement. Influenced by the proponents of scientific racism and eugenics, many Americans considered Blacks intellectually inferior and resented their growing self-determination and empowerment.|$|E
2500|$|Many causes {{have been}} {{proposed}} for this decline; {{a combination of factors}} is most likely. When asked why they do not vote, many people report that they have too little free time. However, over the last several decades, studies have consistently shown that the amount of leisure time has not decreased. According {{to a study by the}} Heritage Foundation, Americans report on average an additional 7.9 hours of leisure time per week since 1965. Furthermore, according to a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research, increases in wages and employment actually decrease voter turnout in gubernatorial elections and do not affect national races. Potential voters' perception that they are busier is common and might be just as important as a real decrease in leisure time. <b>Geographic</b> <b>mobility</b> has increased over the last few decades. There are often barriers to voting in a district where one is a recent arrival, and a new arrival is likely to know little about the local candidate and local issues. Francis Fukuyama has blamed the welfare state, arguing that the decrease in turnout has come shortly after the government became far more involved in people's lives. He argues in Trust: The Social Virtues and The Creation of Prosperity that the social capital essential to high voter turnouts is easily dissipated by government actions. However, on an international level those states with the most extensive social programs tend to be the ones with the highest turnouts. Richard Sclove argues in Democracy and Technology that technological developments in society such as [...] "automobilization," [...] suburban living, and [...] "an explosive proliferation of home entertainment devices" [...] have contributed to a loss of community, which in turn has weakened participation in civic life.|$|E

40|$|The Australian Government {{has asked}} the Commission to assess <b>geographic</b> labour <b>mobility</b> within Australia {{and its role in}} a well-functioning labour market (attachment A). Matters on which the Commission has been asked to report include:• {{patterns}} of <b>geographic</b> labour <b>mobility</b> in Australia, the implications of structural, demographic and technological developments and key determinants of mobility• impediments and enablers of mobility and their effect on the ability to meet Australia’s continually changing workforce and employment needs• the economy-wide impacts of reducing any impediments• existing strategies by governments and businesses that affect <b>geographic</b> labour <b>mobility</b> and possible options to enable further <b>mobility.</b> <b>Geographic</b> labour <b>mobility</b> is one element of a flexible labour market. It is an important mechanism for adjusting to labour demand shocks (such as factory closures), seasonal variations in labour supply, and to broader structural changes in the economy. By enabling labour to move to its best use across different regions of Australia (including outer metropolitan and non-metropolitan locations), it can alleviate labour shortages and regional disparities in labour market conditions, such as high levels of unemployment, and increase skills utilisation, earnings and community wellbeing. At a basic theoretical level, shifts in regional labour supply or labour demand will lead to changes in wages and employment, which will affect an individual’s incentives to work in a given region versus another. Yet, it is not just economic incentives that determine regional labour supply. In deciding where to live and work, people weigh up a complex range of costs and benefits. These costs and benefits are affected by a person’s individual characteristics and circumstances (such as age and family considerations), a range of environmental, economic and social factors, and the actions of businesses and governments. <b>Geographic</b> labour <b>mobility</b> is changing with advances in transport and communication technologies, and demographic and structural changes are also influencing where, how and when we work. In assessing <b>geographic</b> labour <b>mobility</b> within Australia, the Commission will take account of the welfare of the community as a whole. The Commission seeks public input into the study and will consult widely with stakeholders, drawing on input from participants through consultations, written submissions and roundtables. Initial submissions are due by Wednesday 21 August 2013. Opportunity for further comment will be sought upon release of the draft report, which is expected to be released in mid December 2013.

5000|$|Geographical {{mobility}} of labor allows the labor supply {{to respond to}} regional disparities, limiting economic inefficiencies. Low labor mobility quickly leads to inequality between static economic regions and a misappropriation of labor resources. [...] <b>Geographic</b> <b>mobility</b> can help alleviate asymmetric shocks between regions with diversified economies, like in the European Union. [...] A mobile population allows a region to shed workers when jobs are scarce and gives those workers the opportunity seek employment elsewhere where opportunities might be better.

In this paper we provide a novel approach to modeling the impact of the Olympic Games on local retailers by analyzing a dataset mined from a large location-based social service, Foursquare.
