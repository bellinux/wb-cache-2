25|$|When Sides became {{eligible}} for early promotion to rear admiral a month later, the selection board was {{perceived to be}} stacked against captains {{who had participated in}} the Revolt because it included none of the top admirals involved in the controversy. Passed over as expected, in 1950 he took command of the heavy cruiser Albany for a twelve-month tour in the Atlantic Fleet. Sides had hoped to captain the first <b>guided-missile</b> <b>cruiser,</b> which the Navy had expected to put in operation by that year, but its development schedule had slipped due to problems with the sound barrier. The first <b>guided-missile</b> <b>cruiser</b> would not become operational until 1955.|$|E

25|$|While {{the carrier}} strike {{group is the}} various components' {{operational}} superior, administratively the ships and the carrier air wing are assigned to different U.S. Navy type commands (TYCOMs). Aircraft carriers and Carrier Air Wings are under the administrative control of Commander, Naval Air Force U.S. Atlantic Fleet, or Commander, Naval Air Forces, Pacific. Escorts, including <b>guided-missile</b> <b>cruisers</b> and a CSG's destroyer squadron are under the administrative control of Commander, Naval Surface Forces Atlantic or Commander, Naval Surface Forces Pacific.|$|R
50|$|In {{the later}} 20th century, the {{obsolescence}} of the battleship left the cruiser {{as the largest}} and most powerful surface combatant (excluding aircraft carriers). The role of the cruiser varied according to ship and navy, often including air defense, commerce raiding, and shore bombardment. The U.S. Navy in the Cold War period built <b>guided-missile</b> <b>cruisers</b> primarily designed to provide air defense, while the navy of the USSR built battlecruisers with heavy anti-ship missiles designed to sink NATO carrier task forces.|$|R
500|$|On 5 November, Wichita was {{assigned}} to Operation Magic Carpet, the repatriation of American military personnel. She refueled in Tokyo before departing for San Francisco. The ship reached San Francisco on 24 November, where she went into drydock at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard two days later. Repairs and modifications for further Magic Carpet duty were completed by 1 December. Wichita departed for Hawaii on 6 December, reaching Pearl Harbor on 12 December before proceeding to the Marianas. There, the ship loaded servicemen from Saipan and steamed back to San Francisco, arriving on 12 January 1946. She left port on 27 January bound for {{the east coast of}} the United States; she transited the Panama Canal on 5–9 February and reached Philadelphia on 14 February. There, she {{was assigned}} to the Sixteenth Fleet and was placed in reserve on 15 July. Wichita was decommissioned on 3 February 1947 and laid up at Philadelphia. In the late 1940s, the Navy considered converting Wichita into a <b>guided-missile</b> <b>cruiser,</b> but [...] and [...] were chosen instead.

50|$|The Soviets {{were quick}} to equip their surface fleet with {{missiles}} of various sorts. Indeed, it became a feature of Soviet design to place large missiles onto relatively small, but fast, missile boats, while in the West such an approach {{would never have been}} considered tactically feasible. The Soviet Navy did also possess several very large and well-armed <b>guided-missile</b> <b>cruisers,</b> like those of the Kirov and Slava classes. By the 1970s, Soviet submarine technology was in some respects more advanced than in the West, and several of their submarine types were considered superior to their American rivals.|$|R

Arleigh Burkes design includes what is now better known as stealth technology, which improves the ships ability to evade anti-ship missiles. She also uses a slightly downgraded version of the Aegis combat system, which allows for launching, tracking, and evading missiles simultaneously. Her all-steel construction provides good protection for her superstructure, while her Collective Protection System allows her to operate in environments contaminated by chemical, biological, or radiological materials.|$|R

5000|$|The Spruance-class {{received}} the [...] "DD" [...] designation in the hull classification symbol system which was previously applied to gun destroyers, though their primary armament as designed was missiles. However their complement of anti-aircraft missiles only sufficient for point defense, {{compared to other}} American destroyers designated as DDG which were designed to provide anti-aircraft warfare screening to the fleet while some newer ships also added powerful surface-to-surface capabilities. A major update in the 1990s added a Vertical Launch Missile System (VLS) for the Tomahawk surface-to-surface missile which modernized 24 {{members of the class}} to a strike destroyer standard, although they still lacked the anti-aircraft capabilities of <b>guided-missile</b> <b>cruisers</b> (CG and CGN) and destroyers (DDG).|$|R
2500|$|After {{design work}} in the late 1940s aimed at {{producing}} a [...] "1960 cruiser" [...] came to nothing, efforts switched to a smaller design, the [...] "Cruiser/Destroyer", to be armed with three rapid-fire 5-inch (127mm) guns, which was abandoned in 1953. Effort then switched to <b>guided-missile</b> <b>cruisers,</b> which by July 1955 had settled on a [...] ship armed with a two twin Mark 26 6-inch turrets, two 3-inch turrets and a single Seaslug anti-aircraft missile launcher. Three ships {{were included in the}} 1956 construction programme for the Royal Navy, with delivery from 1962, but they were cancelled in 1957. The new 6- and 3-inch mounts were eventually used when three Tiger-class cruisers were completed to a new design in the late 1950s, while the County-class destroyers met the Royal Navy's requirements for a surface-to-air missile armed ship.|$|R
2500|$|The {{designers}} of Arleigh Burke incorporated {{lessons learned from}} the Ticonderoga-class <b>guided-missile</b> <b>cruisers,</b> the latter which was deemed too expensive to continue building and too difficult to further upgrade. With the Arleigh Burke class, the U.S. Navy also returned to all-steel construction. An earlier generation had combined a steel hull with an innovative superstructure made of lighter aluminum to reduce top weight, but the lighter metal proved vulnerable to cracking. Aluminum is also less fire-resistant than steel; a 1975 fire aboard [...] gutted her aluminum superstructure. Battle damage to Royal Navy ships exacerbated by their aluminum superstructures during the 1982 Falklands War supported the decision to use steel. Another lesson from the Falklands War led the navy to protect the ship's vital spaces with double-spaced steel armor (creating a buffer for modern rockets) and kevlar spall liners.|$|R
