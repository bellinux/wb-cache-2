500|$|The episode's script parodied {{parents who}} voiced strong {{opposition}} to South Park, portraying them as so invested in fighting the television program that {{they fail to}} pay attention to what is actually <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> children's lives. This is illustrated in the episode when Stan calls his mother seeking help because Death is chasing him, only for his mother to ignore him because she is too busy protesting the Terrance and Phillip show. This is also demonstrated by the line Kyle says, [...] "I think that parents only get so offended by television because they rely on it as a babysitter and the sole educator of their kids." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Death" [...] {{was written}} and {{directed}} by series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. The episode, along with the Terrance and Phillip show, were inspired by early criticism that South Park was little more than flatulence jokes and primitive animation. The script portrays the parents as so invested in protesting television programs, they fail to pay any attention to what is actually <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> children's lives. They seem to want to make television clean and wholesome so the entertainment industry can raise their kids so they themselves don't have to make the time and effort to be full-time parents. The episode also advocates against censorship and addresses the morality and ethics of euthanasia.|$|E

[...] In his diary, Patton described the place as [...] "one of the most appalling sights that I have ever seen." [...] This was the first Nazi concentration camp to be discovered by the United States Army, and Eisenhower cabled Marshall to get a delegation from congress over to witness and communicate what took place there.

The exercises in writing were not interrupted or deranged. This is a point of fundamental importance; for, if what I should say on the subject of exercising ingenuity and contrivance in teaching, should be the means, in any case, of leading a teacher to break in upon the regular duties of his school, and destroy the steady uniformity with which the great objects of such an institution should be pursued, my remarks had better never have been written. There may be variety in methods and plan; but through all this variety, the school, and every individual pupil of it, must go steadily forward in the acquisition of that knowledge which is of greatest importance in the business of future life. In other words, the variations and changes, admitted by the teacher, ought to be mainly confined to the modes of accomplishing those permanent objects to which all the exercises and arrangements of the school ought steadily to aim. More on this subject however in another chapter.|$|R

60|$|Sir Thomas More.--The {{practical}} {{difference between}} {{the condition of the}} feudal slave, and of the labouring husbandman who succeeded to the business of his station, was mainly this, that the former had neither the feeling nor the insecurity of independence. He served one master as long as he lived; and being at all times sure of the same sufficient subsistence, if he belonged to the estate like the cattle, and was accounted with them as part of the live stock, he resembled them also in the exemption which he enjoyed from all cares concerning his own maintenance and that of his family. The feudal slaves, indeed, were subject to none of those vicissitudes which brought so many of the proudest and most powerful barons to a disastrous end. They had nothing to lose, and they had liberty to hope for; frequently as the reward of their own faithful services, and not seldom from the piety or kindness of their lords. This was a steady hope depending so little upon contingency that it excited no disquietude or restlessness. They were therefore in general satisfied with the lot to which they were born, as the Greenlander is with his climate, the Bedouin with his deserts, and the Hottentot and the Calmuck with their filthy and odious customs; and <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> regular and unvaried course of duty generation after generation, they were content.|$|E

6000|$|When the {{district}} worked by Smithers, and the neighbouring commons round Godalming, where Newman in his Letters of Rusticus {{says he had}} seen the [...] "tops of the furze quite alive with these birds," [...] had been depleted, other favourite haunts of the little doomed furze-lover were visited, and for a time yielded a rich harvest. In a few years the bird was practically extirpated; in the sixties and seventies it was common, now there are many young ornithologists with us who have never seen it (in this country at all events) in a state of nature. In some cases even persons interested in bird life, some of them naturalists too, did not know what was <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> immediate neighbourhood until after the bird was gone. I met with a case of the kind, a very strange case indeed, in the summer of 1899, at a place near the south coast where the bird was common after it had been destroyed in Surrey, but does not now exist. In my search for information I paid a visit to the octogenarian vicar of a small rustic village. He was a native of the parish, and loved his home above all places, even as White loved Selborne, and had been a clergyman in it for over sixty years; moreover he was, I was told, a keen naturalist, and though not a collector nor a writer of books, he knew every plant and every wild animal {{to be found in the}} parish.

25|$|One {{exception}} {{was a military}} force of Poles from the Polish Legions that had fought in Napoleon's army. A majority of Polish soldiers refused {{to fight against the}} Black inhabitants. At the time, there was a familiar situation <b>going</b> <b>on</b> back <b>in</b> <b>their</b> homeland, as these Polish soldiers were fighting for their liberty from the invading Russia, Prussia and Austria that began in 1772. As hopeful as the Haitians, many Poles were seeking union amongst themselves to win back their homeland. As a result, many Polish soldiers admired their enemy and decided to turn on the French army and join the Haitian slaves, and participated in the Haitian revolution of 1804, supporting the principles of liberty for all the people. Władysław Franciszek Jabłonowski who was half-Black was one of the Polish generals at the time. Polish soldiers had a remarkable input in helping the Haitians in the retaliation fights against the French oppressor. They were spared the fate of other Europeans. For their loyalty and support for overthrowing the French, the Poles acquired Haitian citizenship after Haiti gained its Independence, and many of them settled there to never return to Poland. It is estimated that around 500 of the 5280 Poles chose this option. Of the remainder, 700 returned to France to eventually return to Poland, and some – after capitulation – were forced to serve in British units. 160 Poles were later given permission to leave Haiti and some particular ones were sent to France at Haitian expense. To this day, many Polish Haitians still live in Haiti and are of mixed racial origin, however some have blonde hair, light eyes, and other European features. Today, descendants of those Poles who stayed are living in Cazale, Fond-des-Blancs, La Vallée-de-Jacmel, La Baleine, Port-Salut and Saint-Jean-du-Sud.|$|R
