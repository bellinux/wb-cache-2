40|$|Both {{timber and}} glass are {{materials}} that have aesthetically pleasing properties. An appealing {{idea is to}} combine them to overcome the drawbacks and utilise the beneficial mechanical properties. Adhesive bonding with an appropriate adhesive could provide a uniform stress distribution at the transition between the materials. This report presents a study of three different adhesives, silicone, acrylate and polyurethane. Intentionally, adhesives {{with a wide range}} of properties were chosen. The adhesive bonds between timber and glass were tested both in tension and in shear with rather small bonds, 800  mm 2. Special fixtures were designed both for gluing and testing of the adhesive bond specimens studied. The results presented include a traditional study of strength, failure type and relative displacement measured with LVDT’s, but also an extended study with a non-contact optical 3 D-deformation measuring system and finite element modelling. Of the adhesives tested, the acrylate (SikaFast 5215) performed best, both in tension and shear. The mean strength obtained for this adhesive was 3. 0  MPa in tension and 4. 5  MPa in shear. Even if an important factor when gluing glass is the load <b>distribution</b> <b>ability,</b> the flexible silicone adhesive has too low stiffness and strength for use in structural components, where structural refers to the ability of a component to carry loads other than its own weight.

40|$|As {{a natural}} {{extension}} to León and Vivas (2010) and León and Reveiz (2010) this paper briefly describes the Cholesky method for simulating Geometric Brownian Motion processes with long-term dependence, also referred as Fractional Geometric Brownian Motion (FBM). Results {{show that this}} method generates random numbers capable of replicating independent, persistent or antipersistent time-series depending {{on the value of}} the chosen Hurst exponent. Simulating FBM via the Cholesky method is (i) convenient since it grants the ability to replicate intense and enduring returns, which allows for reproducing well-documented financial returns’ slow convergence in distribution to a Gaussian law, and (ii) straightforward since it takes advantage of the Gaussian <b>distribution</b> <b>ability</b> to express a broad type of stochastic processes by changing how volatility behaves with respect to the time horizon. However, Cholesky method is computationally demanding, which may be its main drawback. Potential applications of FBM simulation include market, credit and liquidity risk models, option valuation techniques, portfolio optimization models and payments systems dynamics. All can benefit from the availability of a stochastic process that provides the ability to explicitly model how volatility behaves with respect to the time horizon in order to simulate severe and sustained price and quantity changes. These applications are more pertinent than ever because of the consensus regarding the limitations of customary models for valuation, risk and asset allocation after the most recent episode of global financial crisis.

In this paper, the basic building blocks of the travel-time prediction models are discussed, with a small review of the previous work. A model for the travel-time prediction on freeways based on wavelet packet decomposition and support vector regression (WDSVR) is proposed, which used the multi-resolution and equivalent frequency <b>distribution</b> <b>ability</b> of the wavelet transform to train the support vector machines. The results are compared against the classical support vector regression (SVR) method. Our {{results indicated that the}} wavelet reconstructed coefficient when used as an input to the support vector machine for regression performed better (with selected wavelets only), when compared with the support vector regression model (without wavelet decomposition) with a prediction horizon of 45 minutes and more. The data used in this paper was taken from the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) of District 12 with a detector density of 2. 73, experiencing daily peak hours except most weekends. The data was stored for a period of 214 days accumulated over 5 - minute intervals over a distance of 9. 13 miles.

The basic criteria for selection of wavelet basis for preprocessing the inputs of support vector machines are also explored to filter the set of wavelet families for the WDSVR model. Finally, a configuration of travel-time prediction on freeways is presented with interchangeable prediction methods. </span...|$|E
30|$|Layered double {{hydroxide}} (LDH) is an inorganic–organic nano-layered {{material that}} harbours drug between its two-layered sheets, forming a sandwich-like structure. It is attracting {{a great deal}} of attention as an alternative drug delivery (nanodelivery) system in the field of pharmacology due to their relative low toxic potential. The production of these nanodelivery systems, aimed at improving human health through decrease toxicity, targeted delivery of the active compound to areas of interest with sustained release ability. In this study, we administered zinc-aluminium-LDH-levodopa nanocomposite (ZAL) and zinc-aluminium nanocomposite (ZA) to Sprague Dawley rats to evaluate for acute oral toxicity following OECD guidelines. The oral administration of ZAL and ZA at a limit dose of 2, 000  mg/kg produced neither mortality nor acute toxic signs throughout 14  days of the observation. The percentage of body weight gain of the animals showed no significant difference between control and treatment groups. Animal from the two treated groups gained weight continuously over the study period, which was shown to be significantly higher than the weight at the beginning of the study (P[*]<[*] 0.05). Biochemical analysis of animal serum showed no significant difference between rats treated with ZAL, ZA and controls. There was no gross lesion or histopathological changes observed in vital organs of the rats. The results suggested that ZAL and ZA at 2, 000  mg/kg body weight in rats do not induce acute toxicity in the animals. Elemental analysis of tissues of treated animals demonstrated the wider distribution of the nanocomposite including the brain. In summary, findings of acute toxicity tests in this study suggest that zinc-aluminium nanocomposite intercalated with and the un-intercalated were safe when administered orally in animal models for short periods of time.
