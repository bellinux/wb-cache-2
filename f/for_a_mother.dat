25|$|Chalcis and Eretria are ports on {{the west}} coast of Euboea. Both cities claimed the Lelantine Plain, perhaps {{originally}} made fertile by the river Lelas, which traverses the plain from north to south, as a natural border. Although, strictly speaking, Eretria is located outside the plain, it had a historical claim to it. The reason is that Eretria was probably initially the port <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> town situated further west. That town was located {{at the mouth of the}} Lelas, near modern Lefkandi. Its ancient name is unknown, so it is generally called by that of the modern settlement. Lefkandi suffered heavy destructions in c. 825 BC, after which the majority of its population probably moved to Eretria.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a slight}} romantic aspect to the story, which is {{sometimes}} played down or omitted completely. Wendy's flirtatious desire to kiss Peter, his desire <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> figure, his conflicting feelings for Wendy, Tiger Lily, and Tinker Bell (each representing different female archetypes), and the symbolism of his fight with Captain Hook (traditionally played by the same actor as Wendy's father), all could possibly hint at a Freudian interpretation (see oedipus complex). Most children's adaptations of the play, including the 1953 Disney film, omit any romantic themes between Wendy and Peter, but Barrie's 1904 original, his 1911 novelisation, the 1954 Mary Martin musical, the 1924 and 2003 feature films, all hint at the romantic elements.|$|E

25|$|Ryoji Tsurumi {{has shown}} that the {{transition}} from a shadowy generic figure to one with such concrete actions was effected at a pantomime Harlequin and Mother Goose: or, The Golden Egg in 1806–07. The pantomime was first performed at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane on 29 December, and many times repeated in the new year. Harlequin and Mother Goose: or, The Golden Egg, starred the famous clown Joseph Grimaldi and was written by Thomas Dibdin, who invented the actions suitable <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>Mother</b> Goose brought to the stage and recreated her as a witch-figure, Tsurumi notes. In the first scene, the stage directions show her raising a storm and, for the very first time, flying a gander. The magical Mother Goose transformed the old miser into Pantaloon of the commedia dell'arte and the British pantomime tradition, and the young lovers Colin and Colinette into Harlequin and Columbine. She was played en travesti by Samuel Simmons– a pantomime tradition that survives today– and she also raises a ghost in a macabre churchyard scene.|$|E
25|$|Examining {{the impact}} of {{same-sex}} marriage on children, the plaintiffs introduced Michael Lamb, a developmental psychologist at the University of Cambridge. He contended {{that there is a}} fairly substantial body of literature since the late 1970s that focuses specifically on the adjustment of children parented by gay men and lesbians which provides very good understanding of the factors that affect the adjustment of children being raised by gay and lesbian parents. This substantial body of evidence documents that children raised by gay and lesbian parents are just as likely to be well adjusted as children raised by heterosexual parents. He noted that for significant number of these children, their adjustment would be promoted were their parents able to get married. He added that a field of developmental psychology {{came to the conclusion that}} what makes for an effective parent is the same both <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> or a father, and that children do not need to have a masculine-behaving parent figure, a father, or feminine-behaving parent figure, a mother, in order to be well adjusted. Testimony showed that California was supportive and viewed positively same-sex couple adoption, providing testimony of both the state's experience of same-sex couples and parenting, which was not changed by Proposition 8. Defense witness David Blankenhorn, under cross-examination, concurred that the well-being of children raised by same-sex couples would improve should they be allowed to marry.|$|E

500|$|The EarthBound fan {{community}} at Starmen.net coalesced {{with the intent}} to have Nintendo of America acknowledge the Mother series.

500|$|The {{concept of}} {{motherhood}} is also explored in the episode. According to Elyce Rae Helford, {{in her book}} Fantasy Girls: Gender in the New Universe of Science Fiction and Fantasy Television, Mrs. Peacock functions as a being who has been reduced [...] "to all female functions" [...] by her sons. [...] She is [...] "the grotesquely willing mother who has lost any sense of individual purpose" [...] other than {{to do anything for}} her children. Sonia Saraiya of The A.V. Club writes that [...] "Scully’s sympathy <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>mother</b> that she imagines to be persecuted is turned violently on its head, to reveal a monster whose priorities are not quite so straightforward." [...] The episode {{is also one of the}} first to explore Scully's desire to become a mother. Booker states that the episode presents the dual nature of Scully's [...] "modern desire for motherhood", as opposed to Mrs. Peacock's [...] "perverted notion of family". Helford writes that the entry predicts [...] "Scully's fate as the mother of 'immaculately' (technologically) conceived and monstrous progeny". In the fifth season, Scully indeed learns that she is a mother, albeit accidentally, after her ova was harvested following her abduction in second season, and an alien/human hybrid named Emily is the result. With the revelation that Scully is pregnant at the end of the seventh season finale, [...] "Requiem", the concept revolving around Scully as a mother took center stage in seasons eight and nine with the birth of baby William.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the preface}} to his 1886 book, La Vraie langue celtique et le cromleck de Rennes-les-Bains, Boudet stated that his [...] "cromleck" [...] was [...] "intimately linked to the resurrection" [...] (trouve intimement lié à la résurrection) and in turn cognate to {{the revival of the}} Celtic {{language}} (ou, si l'on veut, au réveil inattendu de la langue celtique) and therefore to his [...] etymological arguments. The first five of the eight chapters in Boudet's 1886 book consists of an argument that ancient languages such as Basque, Celtic, Punic and Hebrew are derived from a more ancient mother language that was identical to Modern English. For example, when Boudet referred to the location known as The Realsès (today called [...] "la Realsesse") he claimed it was derived from two English words: real (i.e., effective), and cess (tax), when commenting how [...] "The Realsès runs in a valley whose fertile earth enables the inhabitants to pay their taxes and where the Celts till their ground for easy produce".

What makes it most difficult is that she has trusted Franco so much. Kiki is very relieved when Franco is proven to be innocent of her father's murder and Ava, who has been passing herself off as Ava's twin is revealed to be alive. Hayley Erin was quite upset by the decision to kill off Silas. [...] "I took it personally" [...] she said. The actress later continued, [...] "But it made for a great storyline {{and there was a lot}} of great material for all of us." [...] Instead of focusing on whether Kiki was aware that Ava was truly alive in her portrayal, Erin went with the most basic off all the emotions with Kiki only being happy to have her mother back.

[...] She said that Michael has the means, unlike some of the others, as he got Janine to tear up their prenuptial agreement before they married, and the flat that Kat's lover obtained could be listed on the books of Janine's property management business, Butcher's Joints. However, White went on to say, [...] "something tells us Kat would find it very difficult to live with herself if she was sleeping with a man whose baby is in a bad way.
