The first (Appendix  1) questionnaire {{was sent to}} specialists in the UK and a second (appendix  2) questionnaire to fourth year medical students at Bristol University, UK. The specialists were asked eight questions, and one <b>free</b> <b>text</b> <b>box</b> was included. Six of the questions required a single answer, while two contained multiple stems {{with a choice of}} answers to semi quantify the specialists answer. The students were asked nine multiple choice questions (one answer only for each question) and one optional written answer question. In some of the questions and answers, bracket descriptions had to be included for clarity and specificity; otherwise, different interpretations and therefore different answers might be given that could affect the results of the study.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Since 2012, {{our group}} has {{undertaken}} a programme of research examining {{the treatment of}} hypertension in people with dementia. Hypertension is managed by GPs, who are guided by NICE guidelines, which make no mention of different management in people with dementia. We sought to explore the views of GPs on whether they manage hypertension differently in people with dementia. Method: We chose to try using an on-online survey to seek views, with both open and closed questions. We offered vignettes describing 71 and 83 year old women without cognitive impairment or with dementia, and a <b>free</b> <b>text</b> <b>box</b> – comments provided in this box were analysed thematically. Results: Although 427 GPs responded to the questionnaire, this was only 7...|$|E
40|$|Background: Alcohol {{and other}} drug use is {{associated}} with poor sleep quality and quantity, but there is limited qualitative research exploring substance users’ experiences of sleep and few psychosocial sleep interventions for them. Aim: To inform the development of psychosocial interventions to improve sleep amongst people reporting drug/alcohol problems. Method: Qualitative data were collected during a sleep survey. Of the 549 drug/alcohol users completing the survey, 188 (34 %) provided additional information about their sleep using a <b>free</b> <b>text</b> <b>box.</b> Responses were analysed via Iterative Categorization. Findings were reviewed {{with reference to the}} Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW). Results: All data were categorized inductively under five headings: i. sleep quality; ii. nature of sleep problems; iii. sleep and substances; iv. factors improving sleep quality; v. factors undermining sleep quality. Substance use undermined sleep, but poor sleep often persisted after substance use had ceased. Sleep problems were diverse; as were the causes of, and strategies for dealing with, those problems. Causes and strategies had biological, psychological, social, and environmental roots. Conclusions: The BCW facilitated the identification of intervention components that might improve the sleep of people who use substances. These components relate to education, training, enablement, modelling, service provision, guidelines and environment...|$|E
40|$|Adults (n [*]=[*] 25) {{completed}} online <b>free</b> <b>text</b> <b>boxes</b> {{about their}} self-harming behaviour. Thematic analysis identified three dominant themes: ‘managing the private self’, ‘managing the public self’ and ‘moving on’. Transcending these themes was {{the notion of}} thresholds of change. Self-harm enables people to manage both their private and public selves. When thresholds of change are surpassed, the public self communicates a need for help. Self-harm exists within a precarious balance of well-being and can {{be a form of}} self-care. Help seeking is instigated when this balance is disrupted and continued if it offers a better form of self-management than the individual’s own self-harming behaviour...|$|R

30|$|Also as an {{instrument}} in this experiment, the use of two questionnaires: a General Information Questionnaire and the QUIS 7.0 for satisfaction measures, this last has a good recognition {{in the field of}} user satisfaction and is used in several mobile usability evaluation studies (Hussain and Kutar 2012 a). The QUIS 7.0 designed by a group of researchers in Human–Computer Interaction at the University of Maryland was used to collect the user’s opinions and to evaluate their satisfaction on different aspects of an interface on a 9 -point scale (Chin et al. 1988). It includes the following components: a demographic questionnaire, the evaluation of the system satisfaction via six scales, and the measures of nine specific interface factors: screen aspects, terminology and system information, learning aspects, system capabilities, technical user guides, online help and online tutorials, multimedia, conferencing, and methods of software installation. Each interface factor has a question as a major component followed by subcomponents questions, each of which rated on a scale of 1 – 9, with significant positive adjectives on the right, other negative on the left and NA (not applicable). The questionnaire also contains <b>free</b> <b>text</b> <b>boxes</b> for each section that allows the user to list his comments and provide feedbacks (Harper et al. 1990).|$|R
40|$|Background: The iWantGreatCare (iWGC) {{questionnaire}} {{was developed by}} the Palliative Care Implementation Board and aims to evaluate palliative care service provision in Wales, through the appraisal of care, as encapsulated in 10 questions and a <b>free</b> <b>text</b> <b>box.</b> In order to fully reflect patients' and families' experiences of care, we previously undertook a qualitative analysis of the free text comments of 596 patients and carers, which highlighted areas not fully assessed in the scored results. Following this analysis, we are undertaking a further project to refine the questionnaire to accommodate patients' and carers' priorities and concerns. Methods: The {{questionnaire was}} refined via an expert consensus day with healthcare professionals, researchers and a lay representative, utilising the qualitative free text analysis, and is now being tested using face–to-face, semi-structured, cognitive interviews with patients (n= 10) and carers (n= 10), who use palliative care services at two hospices in South Wales. The questionnaire comprehensively encompasses the elements of palliative care previously identified as important to patients and carers. Interviews aim to test whether the questions are understandable and pertinent to those completing the questionnaire. Interview transcripts from recorded data are to be analysed using a six phase thematic analysis. Results: It is expected that the interviews will inform the final questionnaire revision prior to being presented to the Palliative Care Implementation Board for their consideration. The results of these cognitive interviews and the refined questionnaire will be outlined and discussed in this presentation...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: ‘Sex addiction’ {{appears to}} have been largely {{accepted}} within clinical fields and popular culture. However, despite its 30 year history, the concept remains ill-defined and lacking in empirical data. Indeed, proponents of sex addiction continue to debate its terminology, definition, nosology, and aetiology, with a coherent model of the ‘disorder’ yet to be offered. An alternative account presented by the social constructionist model argues that the reason for this contention is because, rather than a pathological disorder, sex addiction represents a social construction. Those who argue from this perspective suggest that sex addiction has been created to pathologize sexualities which fail to promote dominant sexual norms. Whilst this argument appears convincing, it is not clear why some may be more influenced by these dominant sexual norms and thus pathologize their sexuality, whilst others do not consider their sexuality to be problematic. The answer to this may lie in certain individual differences, in particular, personality, thinking dispositions, sexual attitudes, and religiosity. Aims: This was an exploratory piece of research which aimed to compare sex addicts (SAs) to ‘non-addicts’ (NSAs) on the dependent variables: sexual behaviour, the Big Five personality traits, categorical thinking, sexual attitudes, and religiosity. Design: A convergent parallel design was employed, using questionnaires to collect quantitative and qualitative data. Method: A self-selecting sample (N = 214) was recruited via poster and online advertisements placed in general public sites such as pubs and clubs, and sex addiction and sexual interest forums. Participants completed an online questionnaire comprising: a) an assessment of ‘sex addiction’ via participant’s self-identification and a clinical screening tool (the Sexual Addiction Screening tool; SAST); b) a <b>free</b> <b>text</b> <b>box</b> in which participants explained their self-identification; c) a questionnaire collecting demographic data and assessing the variables under investigation. Results: Participants’ constructs of sex addiction largely mapped onto the dominant model of sex addiction. This was particularly evident within SAs’ responses. Conversely, a number of themes within NSAs’ responses diverged from the sex addiction model and expressed a positive view of sex. Subsequent statistical analyses comparing self-identified SAs to NSAs found SAs reported a greater frequency of solo sex and evidenced more categorical thinking. No other significant differences were observed, with the exception of neuroticism whereby SAs scored higher when samples were matched for sexual activity. When the SAST defined the groups, SAs reported a greater frequency of solo sex and anal sex, and reported a higher number of partners for oral sex and anal sex. These SAs also scored significantly higher in neuroticism and were less satisfied with their current sexual activity. Discussion: The study demonstrates the immersion of the dominant model of sex addiction within sociocultural norms and suggests that SA participants in particular have internalised these norms into their interpretive frameworks. The subsequent comparison between the groups suggests that idiographic factors may interact with these discourses, meaning some are more influenced than others by these discourses. In particular, those with a propensity to think inflexibly (categorical thinking) and/or a predisposition to respond with negative emotionality and worry (neuroticism) {{may be more likely to}} appraise their sexuality as problematic and this identify as a SA. The study also lends support to the idea that the SAST tools may unduly pathologize sexual behaviours which are considered ‘unconventional’...|$|E
40|$|Aims: To {{survey the}} views of clinicians (urologists and gynecologists) about a {{proposed}} randomized surgical trial comparing two approaches {{for the treatment of}} women with urinary incontinence and vaginal prolapse. Methods: A questionnaire survey nested within a pilot randomized controlled trial of colposuspension versus anterior repair plus TVT (CARPET 1) for women with incontinence and anterior vaginal prolapse. Members of the UK Continence Society, British Society of Urogynaecology, and International Continence Society were sent a single electronic mailing of semi-structured questionnaires containing closed and open questions and <b>free</b> <b>text</b> response <b>boxes.</b> <b>Free</b> <b>text</b> responses were analyzed using a thematic qualitative analysis. Results: One hundred fifty-seven questionnaires were returned, from a potential total of 400 from UK and 1, 700 international respondents. Fifty-eight percent thought the trial ethical, 44 % desirable, and 47 % feasible. Thirty-three percent would recruit to the full study, and 22 % would enroll themselves or their partner. Analysis of <b>free</b> <b>text</b> responses identified three themes impacting participation: issues of patient choice and consent; clinicians' views of perceived benefit and complications of the two arms; and issues about the chosen trial design. Conclusions: This study highlights the difference between collective and individual equipoise and their impact upon surgical trials. Clinicians held strong views preventing them from regarding the study favorably. Difficulty with relinquishing control over choice of procedure appeared central. These findings support the growing evidence in favor of detailed qualitative pilot work for surgical trials. The role of expertise-based randomization deserves further consideration...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this survey was to identify the importance placed by Croatian-based surgeons on writing scientific manuscripts and publishing them internationally, {{as well as their}} awareness of and attitudes toward medical writing. A link to an online survey was sent to 327 Croatian-based orthopedic and trauma surgeons. The electronic questionnaire consisted of rating scales, multiple choice questions and <b>free</b> <b>text</b> reply <b>boxes.</b> A total of 61 surgeons based in Croatia replied to the survey, yielding a response rate of 19 % (61 / 327). The survey results indicate that surgeons in Croatia are active in both research and the writing of manuscripts. There is also a high level of interest among them to publish internationally in English to further their careers. While 68 % (38 / 56) of respondents initially claimed to know about medical writing, further questioning on the subject revealed a reduced level of familiarity with the concept. Only 19 % (11 / 58) of respondents had ever engaged the services of a medical writer and they were generally satisfied with the work done across the three areas of language, editing and scientific knowledge. Medical writers are advised to increase awareness of their services among Croatian-based orthopedic and trauma surgeons who may well have a need for their expertise...|$|R
