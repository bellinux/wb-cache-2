5|$|As {{a result}} of the duel between the two ironclads, Monitor had been struck twenty-two times, {{including}} nine hits to the turret and two hits to the pilothouse. She had managed to fire forty-one shots from her pair of Dahlgren guns. Virginia had sustained ninety-seven indentations to her armor from the fire of Monitor and other ships. Neither ship had sustained any significant damage. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> Virginias commander Jones and her other officers, Monitor could have sunk their ship had she hit the vessel at the waterline.|$|E
5|$|Executive {{power is}} vested in the Cabinet, {{led by the}} Prime Minister. The prime {{minister}} must {{be a member of}} the house of representatives, who <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> the King, commands a majority in parliament. The cabinet is chosen from members of both houses of Parliament. The Prime Minister is both the head of cabinet and the head of government.

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> Rasanayagam Mudaliar and Swami Gnanapragasar the Aryacakravarti dynasty was {{connected}} to the Eastern Ganga Dynasty. Rasanayagam believes that a Brahmin from the town of Rameswaram married into the surviving family members of the Kalinga Magha, an invader claiming to be from Kalinga kingdom in India. Magha apparently belonged to the Eastern Ganga Dynasty. The Royal flag of the Jaffna kingdom is similar to the Royal insignia of the Eastern Gangas. Gangas themselves also claimed Brahmin origins. The Setu coins minted by the Aryacakravarti kings also have a similar symbol.|$|E

5|$|The Moravian {{cultural}} influence {{played a}} significant role in the spread of Christianity onto the Polish lands and the subsequent adoption of that religion. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> Davies, the Christianisation of Poland through the Czech–Polish alliance represented a conscious choice on the part of Polish rulers to ally themselves with the Czech state rather than the German one. In a similar fashion, some of the later political struggles involved the Polish Church refusing to subordinate itself to the German hierarchy and instead being directly subordinate to the Vatican.|$|E
5|$|The {{next section}} accuses the Dissenters of {{involvement}} with various notorious and hideous {{events of the}} past century, including the English Civil War and Monmouth's Rebellion. The accusations become increasingly sinister, and at points the speaker directly addresses the Dissenters ("You have butchered one King! deposed another King! and made a Mock King of a third!"). A brief history is given of how past monarchs—from James I to William III—have treated the Dissenters; <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> the speaker, it is too leniently.|$|E

5|$|With Romanos I {{approaching}} {{the end of}} his life, the matter of his succession became urgent. In 943, Romanos drafted a will which would leave Constantine VII as the senior emperor following his death. This greatly upset his two sons, who feared that their brother-in-law would have them deposed and force them to take monastic vows. Motivated, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> Steven Runciman, partially by self-preservation and partially from genuine ambition, they started planning to seize power through a coup d'état, with Stephen apparently the ringleader and Constantine a rather reluctant partner.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{majority}} of those advocating a name change are Democrats, {{there is no indication that}} the issue is of any real significance in electoral decisions given that Native Americans are such a small percentage of the electorate and are not likely to influence the outcome of any election. There are only eight states where Natives make up greater than 2 percent of the population: Alaska, Arizona, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wyoming. However, polls show a definite political difference <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> the general public, with only 58% of Democrats opposing a name change versus 89% of Republicans. Statements by political figures have generally been expressions of personal opinion rather than recommendations for government action. There have also been non-binding resolutions advocating name change proposed in New Jersey and passed in Minneapolis, New York State and California.|$|E
5|$|Another {{traditionally}} respected {{group which}} Joehana criticizes is the hajjis, those Muslims {{who have been}} on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. The hajjis in Joehana's stories are generally greedy and lustful, without any interest in the good of humanity. In Tjarios Agan Permas, for instance, Hajji Serbanna displays his hypocrisy by damning usury as haraam (sinful) while charging high interest rates for a loan, and refuses to complete the mandatory prayers because he is waiting on a guest bearing large gifts. The hajji is portrayed as wearing so much make-up that, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> Kartini et al., it is as if he is deliberately dressing as a clown.|$|E

He was created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester a month later on 23 June 1910, his 16th birthday. Preparations for his future as king began in earnest. He was withdrawn from his naval course before his formal graduation, served as midshipman for three months aboard the battleship Hindustan, then immediately entered Magdalen College, Oxford, for which, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> his biographers, he was underprepared intellectually. A keen horseman, he learned how to play polo with the university club. He left Oxford after eight terms, without any academic qualifications.|$|E
5|$|Hobbs played {{just five}} {{first-class}} matches in 1921, when Australia toured England. In his opening first-class game, he played against the touring team, but tore the same thigh muscle injured in Australia. He missed the opening two Tests, but once recovered, scored a century for Surrey; as England trailed 2–0 in the five-Test series, the selectors chose {{him for the}} third Test. In the days approaching the match, played in Leeds, he suffered from increasing stomach pain but reluctantly played. On {{the first day of}} the match, he had to leave the field, and after a day of rest the pain worsened. He consulted Sir Berkley Moynihan, a prominent surgeon based in Leeds, who diagnosed acute appendicitis and operated the same day. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> the surgeon, Hobbs would not have lived another five hours without surgery. He missed the rest of the season.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Saran {{made her}} Malayalam debut with Pokkiri Raja, {{in which she}} {{appeared}} opposite Mammootty and Prithviraj.

She then enacted her first lead role in a Telugu film after five years, in the commercially successful action-comedy Don Seenu opposite Ravi Teja, where she plays the sister of a mobster. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> some critics, she stole the show with her dances and romantic scenes.|$|E

40|$|Supplemental {{articles}} and supplementary treaties {{were used as}} tools to modify American Indian treaties.

5|$|Meanwhile, at the UN, {{although}} the UN members and US were initially divided {{on how to}} respond to Chinese intervention in Korea, the Chinese rejection of UN ceasefire soon rallied the UN members towards US. Immediately afterward, a UN resolution that condemned China as an aggressor was passed on February 1. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> historian Bevin Alexander, the Chinese rejection of UN ceasefire had damaged the international prestige it had built from its earlier military successes, and this later made it difficult for China to either join the UN or to deny US support for Taiwan. The Korean War, which ultimately ended at the 38th parallel, would drag on for another two bloody years due to the Chinese demand for all UN forces to be withdrawn from the Korean Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Polikarpov {{was arrested}} and imprisoned by the OGPU in September 1929 for the crime of {{industrial}} sabotage when neither the I-6 nor the I-5 projects met their stipulated deadlines, and this delayed the first flight of the I-6 until 30 March 1930. The second prototype was completed shortly thereafter and both aircraft appeared in that year's May Day fly-past over Moscow. Both aircraft likely used imported engines before they were replaced by the Soviet-built copy of the Jupiter, the Shvetsov M-22.

5|$|Sanders {{was unhappy}} with the 35 minutes it took to prepare his chicken in an iron frying pan, {{but he refused to}} deep fry the chicken, which he {{believed}} lowered the quality of the product. If he pre-cooked the chicken in advance of orders, there was sometimes wastage at day's end. In 1939, the first commercial pressure cookers were released onto the market, mostly designed for steaming vegetables. Sanders bought one, and modified it into a pressure fryer, which he then used to fry chicken. The new method reduced production time to be comparable with deep frying, while, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> Sanders, retaining the quality of pan-fried chicken.|$|E
