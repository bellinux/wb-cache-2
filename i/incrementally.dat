5|$|V-Planner {{runs the}} {{variable}} permeability model, developed by D.E. Yount {{and others in}} 2000, and allows the choice of VPM-B and VPM-B/E, with six conservatism levels (baseline plus five <b>incrementally</b> more conservative ones). GAP allows the user to choose between a multitude of Bühlmann-based algorithms and the full reduced gradient bubble model, developed by Bruce Wienke in 2001, in its five conservatism levels (baseline, two <b>incrementally</b> more liberal and two <b>incrementally</b> more conservative).|$|E

5|$|The {{sound on}} a tonewheel Hammond organ is varied through the {{manipulation}} of drawbars. A drawbar is a metal slider that controls the volume of a particular sound component, {{in a similar way}} to a fader on an audio mixing board. As a drawbar is <b>incrementally</b> pulled out, it increases the volume of its sound. When pushed all the way in, the volume is decreased to zero.|$|E
5|$|A {{common theme}} {{throughout}} Zobel's {{work is the}} issue of impedance matching. The obvious approach to filter design is to design directly for the attenuation characteristics desired. With modern computing power, a brute force approach is possible and easy, simply <b>incrementally</b> adjusting each component while recalculating in an iterative process until the desired response is achieved. However, Zobel developed a more indirect line of attack. He realized very early on that mismatched impedances inevitably meant reflections, and reflections meant a loss of signal. Improving the impedance match, conversely, would automatically improve a filter's pass-band response.|$|E
5|$|As the Allied {{offensive}} gained steam, Whitehead's {{main task}} was to shift his aircraft forward, advancing the bomb line <b>incrementally</b> towards Japan. When the P-38 Lightning arrived in the theater in late 1942, Whitehead at last received a fighter that could match the Japanese A6M Zero. To speed up the Allied advance, the Fifth Air Force developed a number of technical and tactical innovations that extended the range of its aircraft, thus increasing the distance of each Allied advance, which was dependent on the range of Whitehead's aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Developed in {{response}} to the American Polaris programme, the Tu-142 grew out of the need for a viable Soviet ASW platform. It succeeded the stillborn Tu-95PLO project, Tupolev's first attempt at modifying the Tu-95 for maritime use. The Tu-142 differed from the Tu-95 in having a stretched fuselage to accommodate specialised equipment for its ASW and surveillance roles, a reinforced undercarriage to support rough-field capability, improved avionics and weapons, and enhancements to general performance. The Tu-142's capability was <b>incrementally</b> improved while the type was in service, eventually resulting in the Tu-142MZ, the final long-range Tu-142 with highly sophisticated combat avionics and a large payload. Tupolev also converted a number of Tu-142s as avionics (Tu-142MP) and engine (Tu-142LL) testbeds.|$|E
5|$|The Patries {{design as}} a {{semi-rigid}} airship {{required that the}} pressure of both the lifting gas in the gas-bag and {{the air in the}} ballonet be sufficient to maintain the airship's overall shape. Sufficient hydrogen was pumped into the gas-bag to enable the airship to ascend to its intended maximum operating altitude of , at which height the ballonet would occupy approximately one-fifth of the total gas-bag volume. Descent was made by releasing hydrogen from the gas-bag and then pumping air into the ballonet to take up the volume of the released gas, a process which was repeated <b>incrementally</b> until the desired rate of descent or altitude had been achieved.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship had}} a short career; she served with the fleet for the first seven years, after which she was {{decommissioned}} and placed in reserve. After the outbreak of World War I, she was reactivated and returned to front-line service. After returning from the raid on Yarmouth on 3–4 November 1914, the ship made a navigational error in heavy fog and accidentally sailed into a German defensive minefield. The ship sank quickly with heavy loss of life, though sources disagree on {{the exact number of}} fatalities. Her commander was court-martialled and imprisoned for disobedience and negligent homicide. Yorck was broken up <b>incrementally,</b> with work occurring in 1929–30, 1965, and finally completed in 1982.|$|E
5|$|GO {{has always}} owned its {{locomotives}} and coaches, but its trackage {{used to be}} owned entirely by Canada's two major commercial railways: the large majority by the Canadian National Railway (CN) and the remainder (the current Milton line) by Canadian Pacific Railway (CP). In 1988, as part of expanding service east of Pickering, GO built its first section of self-owned purpose-built trackage. From 1998 until 2009, GO owned only 6% of the railway trackage on which it operated. Starting in 2009, Metrolinx <b>incrementally</b> acquired further trackage from the two commercial railways {{in order to improve}} GO service. As of 2014, Metrolinx has complete ownership of the Barrie, Stouffville and Lakeshore East lines, and a majority of the Lakeshore West, Richmond Hill, and Kitchener lines. CP still owns most of the Milton line. This puts Metrolinx ownership at 80% of GO Transit's trackage.|$|E
5|$|NuScale is {{expected}} to be the first SMR to market, because its cooling is similar to the systems used in conventional power plants. However, alternative cooling systems using molten metals are expected to operate at higher, more efficient temperatures once approved. The company estimates a twelve-unit NuScale plant would cost $5,000 per kilowatt. In comparison, the Energy Information Administration in 2011 estimated costs to be $4,700 per kilowatt for conventional nuclear power, $4,600 for a carbon sequestration coal plant and $931 at a gas-fired plant or in excess of $1,800 for a gas-fired plant with carbon sequestration. David Mohre, executive director of NRECA's Energy and Power Division, said SMR's like NuScale's are ideal for rural towns that need small power plants and do not have access to natural gas. NuScale power plants are also expected to take less time, materials and space to construct than other power sources and can be expanded <b>incrementally</b> to meet changing power needs.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the thirty}} years from 1880 onwards, rule changes were <b>incrementally</b> {{introduced}} into the game, including {{the adoption of the}} line of scrimmage, scoring that began to resemble the modern version, and the down and yardage structure. Popular personalities of the era included player-coach Joe Wright Sr., one of the best all around Canadian athletes {{at the turn of the}} century. One major outstanding issue within the CRU at the time was the role of professional versus amateur players; this dispute caused the Argonauts to withdraw from the league in 1903 and eventually led to the establishment of a new league, The Big Four or Interprovincial Rugby Football League. Alongside the professionalism dispute, there was serious disagreement over the adoption of the Burnside rules, with Ontario, Quebec, and the intercollegiate league often not in alignment. Amongst other critical innovations, the Burnside rules reduced the number of men per side to 12 and introduced the ten yards in three downs structure that is central to the modern game.|$|E
5|$|According to France Football, Messi was the world's highest-paid footballer {{for five}} years out of six between 2009 and 2014; {{he was the first}} player to exceed the €40million benchmark, with {{earnings}} of €41million in 2013, and the €50–€60million points, with income of €65million in 2014. In 2016, Messi was second on Forbes list of the world's highest-paid athletes (after Cristiano Ronaldo) with income of $81.4 million from his salary and endorsements in 2015–16. Since 2008, he has been Barcelona's highest-paid player, receiving a salary that increased <b>incrementally</b> from €7.8million to €13million over the next five years. His current salary of €20million net (€36million before taxes), established in 2014, is the highest ever in the sport. In addition to his salary and multimillion-euro bonuses, much of his income derives from endorsements; SportsPro has consequently cited him as one of the world's most marketable athletes every year since their research began in 2010. His main sponsor since 2006 is the sportswear company Adidas. As Barça's leading youth prospect, he had been signed with Nike since age 14, but transferred to Adidas after they successfully challenged their rival's claim to his image rights in court. Over time, Messi established himself as their leading brand endorser; from 2008, he had a long-running signature collection of Adidas F50 boots, and in 2015, he became the first footballer to receive his own sub-brand of boots, the Adidas Messi.|$|E

25|$|A {{positive}} example {{may be a}} clinician who uses an interview technique {{as well as a}} specific questionnaire to determine if a patient has mental illness and has better success at determining mental illness than a clinician who uses the interview technique alone. Thus, the specific questionnaire would be considered <b>incrementally</b> valid. Because the questionnaire in conjunction with the interview produced more accurate determinations, and added information for the clinician, the questionnaire is <b>incrementally</b> valid.|$|E

25|$|Design {{capacity}} is 10 million passengers per year, with 28 gates on 3 concourses (current B,C and D). The terminal buildings can be expanded <b>incrementally</b> to 65 gates on 5 concourses (A-E).|$|E
25|$|Because arcs of {{circles and}} ellipses cannot be exactly {{represented}} by Bézier curves, they are first approximated by Bézier curves, {{which are in}} turn approximated by arcs of circles. This is inefficient as there exists also approximations of all Bézier curves using arcs of circles or ellipses, which can be rendered <b>incrementally</b> with arbitrary precision. Another approach, used by modern hardware graphics adapters with accelerated geometry, can convert exactly all Bézier and conic curves (or surfaces) into NURBS, that can be rendered <b>incrementally</b> without first splitting the curve recursively to reach the necessary flatness condition. This approach also allows preserving the curve definition under all linear or perspective 2D and 3D transforms and projections.|$|E

25|$|Henley Royal Regatta {{has always}} been raced over a {{distance}} of ‘about one mile and 550 yards’ from Temple Island upstream towards Henley Bridge. However, four distinct courses have been used over the regatta’s history, with smaller changes also being made <b>incrementally.</b> Changes to the course have all been aimed at improving the prospects for fair and safe racing.|$|E
25|$|During the American Revolutionary War Spain recaptured colonial Florida (which at {{that time}} {{included}} Gulf Coast lands extending {{all the way to}} the Mississippi River) from Great Britain, which was ratified in the 1783 Treaty of Paris. But, within about 35 years, all of this territory was <b>incrementally</b> obtained by the U.S.; this was due in part to boundary disputes.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of the brain region (barrel cortex) which receives information from the vibrissae {{is similar to that}} found in the visual cortex which permits the cat to create a three-dimensional map of its surroundings. This doesn't mean that sensing with vibrissae is a type of vision. It is still a touch sensation and environmental information is built up <b>incrementally</b> (in small steps).|$|E
25|$|The DSM {{is now in}} {{its fifth}} edition, the DSM-5, {{published}} on May 18, 2013. The DSM evolved from systems for collecting census and psychiatric hospital statistics, and from a United States Army manual. Revisions since its first publication in 1952 have <b>incrementally</b> added to the total number of mental disorders, although also removing those no longer considered to be mental disorders.|$|E
25|$|By 1951, SH 118 {{had been}} <b>incrementally</b> {{extended}} south of Alpine {{to the park}} boundary along its present alignment through Study Butte and over {{the portion of the}} former spur road to the park boundary. State maintenance between Terlingua and Study Butte was reestablished as RM 2462 in 1956. RM 2462 was then extended westward to the Presidio County line just west of Lajitas in 1957.|$|E
25|$|During their {{enormous}} {{success in}} Trans-Am, Penske and Donohue {{would begin to}} experiment with their Camaros. They discovered that dipping a car in an acid bath would eat away small amounts of metal, which in turn made the car <b>incrementally</b> lighter, and allowed it to be driven faster. The 1967 Z-28 won its last race by lapping the entire field of cars, causing suspicion throughout the paddock.|$|E

25|$|The Umnumzaan blade pivot is {{implemented}} with a pivot screw and pin, and {{is supported by}} perforated phosphor bronze thrust washers. The functions of the perforations are to reduce friction due {{to a reduction in}} surface area relative to that of a solid washer, and to increase the duration of use between cleanings by housing lubricant in the perforations. Over the life of the Umnumzaan, the pivot and washers have been <b>incrementally</b> modified.|$|E
25|$|The work of {{exploration}} was carried on by George Smith, Hormuzd Rassam (a modern Assyrian), and others, {{and a vast}} treasury of specimens of Assyria was <b>incrementally</b> exhumed for European museums.
