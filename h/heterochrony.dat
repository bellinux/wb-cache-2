5|$|Gould made {{significant}} contributions to evolutionary developmental biology, especially in his work Ontogeny and Phylogeny. In this book he emphasized the process of <b>heterochrony,</b> which encompasses two distinct processes: neoteny and terminal additions. Neoteny is the process where ontogeny is slowed down and the organism does not reach the end of its development. Terminal addition is the process by which an organism adds to its development by speeding and shortening earlier stages in the developmental process. Gould's influence in the field of evolutionary developmental biology continues to be seen today in areas such as the evolution of feathers.|$|E

40|$|We {{documented}} hypotheses on {{the evolution}} of developmental <b>heterochronies</b> by estimating short- and long-term advantages of alternative morphs. In this respect, we compared food energy intakes and body condition between paedomorphic and metamorphic Alpine newts (Triturus alpestris, Caudata, Amphibia) in four populations. Because we found a strong correlation between fat reserves and body condition, we used this last parameter as an indicator of long-term gains. In all studied sites, paedomorphic females showed higher body condition than metamorphic ones. Paedomorphic males were also at advantage in two populations. Paedomorphs exhibited higher energy intakes than metamorphs in two populations and similar gains in two others. Our results support unifying theories that predict the occurrence of facultative paedomorphosis in varied habitats as paedomorphs exhibited better energy balance than metamorphs.

Despite their different egg and embryo sizes, event pairing shows that there are only very few <b>heterochronies</b> among the three Bombina species and the three Discoglossus species in early developmental events. Instead, differences become apparent at the genus level (interpreted as phylogenetic signal). For example, the separation into a mandibular and a hyoid portion of cranial neural crest could be seen earlier in the Discoglossus than in the Bombina species when compared with the development of the neural tube. The development of the cranial neural crest streams also shifts (relatively) forward in time when compared with body elongation and somite formation in the Discoglossus species in contrast to the Bombina species.

A 2011 phylogenetic analysis by Watabe and colleagues did not place the two Stegoceras species close to each other. In 2016, Williamson and Stephen L.

Furthermore, they were unable to determine whether the holotype specimen represented the distinct species S. novomexicanum, or if it was a juvenile of either S. validum or Sphaerotholus goodwini, or another previously known pachycephalosaur. In 2016, Jasinski and Sullivan defended the validity of S. novomexicanum; they agreed that some features used to diagnose the species were indicative of a sub-adult stage, but presented additional diagnostic features in the holotype that distinguish the species. They also pointed out some adult features, which may indicate <b>heterochrony</b> (difference in timing of ontogenetic changes between related taxa) in the species. They conceded that the paratypes and other assigned specimens differed from the holotype in having more highly domed skulls, instead referring to them as cf. S. novomexicanum (difficult to identify), but found it likely they all belonged to the same taxon (with the assigned specimens being adults), due to the restricted stratigraphic interval and geographic range.|$|E

40|$|The {{neoliberal}} {{environmental governance}} of river conservation, {{coupled with the}} organizational modernization imposed and sustained by the European Union’s water directives, engenders Other Spaces of feminist ecological alignment. The riparian landscapes of urban cities are manifestations of political and ideological rationalities operating under the constraints of capitalist markets, and are saturated by the contradictions of neoliberal environmental science. Neoliberal rationalities configure river waterways as “sites”, the dimensions of which are analogous to Michel Foucault’s account of spatial heterotopias as polymerous relations of propinquity between junctures. Many of the modernising initiatives instituted by the European Union’s Water Framework Directive can be discerned as biopolitical neoliberal regimes governing local river spaces, through the enfolding into “spaces of emplacement” and the “sites” of programmatic calculation, financialisation of the domestic sphere, and market-based neoliberal environmental science. Primarily informed by organizational ethnographies, extensive interviews and ethnographic observations of river restorations, this book empirically examines how the relationally embodied <b>heterochronies</b> of ecological activism challenge the programmatic rationalities of the European Union’s river ‘government’, namely its shifting assemblages of formal and informal agencies, practices and institutions that variously and differentially align the self-regulating ability of subjects with the design, objectives {{and scope of the}} European Union’s neoliberal regime of river governance. This book’s analysis of the complex inter-governmental networking eliding the local governance of rivers with voluntary sector community-outreach and European Union directives identifies new locations of ecological activism precipitated by political affinities, which have become simultaneously public and private. The capacity of river heterotopias to intersect the public and private spheres of urban cities emphasises the intrinsic reproductive labour time of river restoration; for, as Foucault suggests, the <b>heterochronies</b> of urban heterotopia {{are one and the same}} time “outside of time”, while also constituting “a sort of perpetual and indefinite accumulation of time in an immobile place”.

500|$|From {{the early}} 19th century {{through most of}} the 20th century, {{embryology}} faced a mystery. Animals were seen to develop into adults of widely differing body plan, often through similar stages, from the egg, but zoologists knew almost nothing about how [...] embryonic development was controlled at the molecular level, and therefore equally little about how developmental processes had evolved. Charles Darwin argued that a shared embryonic structure implied a common ancestor. As an example of this, Darwin cited in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species the shrimp-like larva of the barnacle, whose sessile adults looked nothing like other arthropods; Linnaeus and Cuvier had classified them as molluscs. Darwin also noted Alexander Kowalevsky's finding that the tunicate, too, was not a mollusc, but in its larval stage had a notochord and pharyngeal slits which developed from the same germ layers as the equivalent structures in vertebrates, and should therefore be grouped with them as chordates. 19th century zoology thus converted embryology into an evolutionary science, connecting phylogeny with homologies between the germ layers of embryos. Zoologists including Fritz Müller proposed the use of embryology to discover phylogenetic relationships between taxa. Müller demonstrated that crustaceans shared the Nauplius larva, identifying several parasitic species that had not been recognised as crustaceans. Müller also recognised that natural selection must act on larvae, just as it does on adults, giving the lie to recapitulation, which would require larval forms to be shielded from natural selection. Two of Haeckel's other ideas about the evolution of development have fared better than recapitulation: he argued in the 1870s that changes in the timing (<b>heterochrony)</b> and changes in the positioning within the body (heterotopy) of aspects of embryonic development would drive evolution by changing the shape of a descendant's body compared to an ancestor's. It took a century before these ideas were shown to be correct. In 1917, D'Arcy Thompson wrote a book on the shapes of animals, showing with simple mathematics how small changes to parameters, such as the angles of a gastropod's spiral shell, can radically alter an animal's form, though he preferred mechanical to evolutionary explanation.|$|E

2500|$|Haeckel {{advanced}} {{a version}} of the earlier recapitulation theory previously set out by Étienne Serres in the 1820s and supported by followers of Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire including Robert Edmond Grant.

His concept of recapitulation has been refuted in the form he gave it (now called [...] "strong recapitulation"), in favour of the ideas first advanced by Karl Ernst von Baer. The strong recapitulation hypothesis views ontogeny as repeating forms of the ancestors, while weak recapitulation means that what is repeated (and built upon) is the ancestral embryonic development process. Haeckel supported the theory with embryo drawings that have since been shown to be oversimplified and in part inaccurate, and the theory is now considered an oversimplification of quite complicated relationships. Haeckel introduced the concept of <b>heterochrony,</b> the change in timing of embryonic development over the course of evolution.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the development of}} the whole skeleton of the soft-shelled turtle Pelodiscus sinensis, with particular emphasis on the pattern and sequence of ossification. Ossification starts at late Tokita-Kuratani stage (TK) 18 with the maxilla, followed by the dentary and prefrontal. The quadrate is the first endoskeletal ossification and appears at TK stage 22. All adult skull elements have started ossification by TK stage 25. Plastral bones are the first postcranial bones to ossify, whereas the nuchal is the first carapacial bone to ossify, appearing as two unstained anlagen. Extensive examination of ossification sequences among autopodial elements reveals much intraspecific variation. Patterns of ossification of cranial dermal elements are more variable than those of endochondral elements, and dermal elements ossify before endochondral ones. Differences in ossification sequences with Apalone spinifera include: in Pelodiscus sinensis the jugal develops relatively early and before the frontal, whereas it appears later in A. spinifera; the frontal appears shortly before the parietal in A. spinifera whereas in P. sinensis the parietal appears several stages before the frontal. Chelydrids exhibit an early development of the postorbital bone and the palatal elements as compared to trionychids. Integration of the onset of ossification data into an analysis of the sequence of skeletal ossification in cryptodirans using the event-pairing and Parsimov methods reveals <b>heterochronies,</b> some of which reflect the hypothesized phylogeny considered taxa.

40|$|International audienceTaxonomy is an {{important}} step that has a major influence over all other downstream fields of paleontological research. But when the aspect of variability is not (or too little) taken into account, the number of divisions in a given taxonomic group can artificially increase and no longer reflect the biodiversity they are supposed to materialize. Oversplitting produced by the typologist approach tends to override the evolutionary signal and makes it undetectable or uninterpretable, and thus makes any attempt tedious to use a group in biostratigraphy. It also contributes to artificially overestimate biodiversity, to produce phylogenetically fictitious parallel lineages uninterpretable evolutionarily, etc. The study of intraspecific morphological variability associated with an evolutionary view is of primary interest to fight against this bias in ammonites. There are several generic factors potentially at the origin of the patterns of intraspecific variability in the ammonites: (1) dimorphism, (2) changes in the ontogenic sequence, (3) changes in the rate of growth, which can affect the duration of ontogenic stages and adult size (<b>heterochronies</b> of development), (4) variation in shell proportions and ornamentation within one ontogenic stage (covariation), (5) phylogenetic changes (microevolution), and (6) geographic and environmental variations. These factors are materialized by (1) The dipolar covariation (i. e. 1 st Buckman’s Law of covariation). (2) The tripolar covariation. The existence of variability around three morphological poles in groups distant phyletically and stratigraphically, demonstrates that this variability is not a marginal case. (3) The <b>heterochronies</b> of the development, wich can be morphological dependant or independant. (4) The secondary attenuation of ornamentation, wich can occur regardless of the type of morphology, from the gracil forms with weak ornamentation to the hyper-ornated robust forms. (5) The dimorphism of sexual origin. The antidimorphes can be distinguished (macroconchs and microconchs) by differences in size, coiling (opening of the umbilicus or uncoiling of the shell), changes in the peristome, changes in ornamentation, or all four combined. (6) The coiling variation in heteromorphic ammonites, ornamental dependant or not. The importance of the dipolar covariation is confirmed to explain intraspecific variability in ammonites. It seems to be the norm for a large number of cases, or at least to be dominant despite some of possible variants. However, {{it is not the only}} source of covariation and its influence must be relativized against the other factors cited. This list is not exhaustive, and it appears that the covariation is subject to several agents that reflect the expression of different mechanisms and causes, and whose action is nested but not necessarily interdependent.

40|$|The {{present study}} explores the shape changes of cranial {{structures}} {{directly involved in}} food capturing during growth after reef settlement in two species of Pomacentridae (Dascyllus aruanus and Pomacentrus pavo). Landmark-based geometric morphometrics were used to study allometric patterns and related shape changes in four skeletal units: neurocranium, suspensorium and opercle, mandible and premaxilla. At settlement, the larvae of both species have a relatively similar morphology, especially {{with respect to the}} mandible. Their shapes suggest a feeding mode defined as ram/suction-feeding. Ontogenetic shape changes show a shift to a suction feeding mode of prey capture. The main transformations involved are an increase in height of the suspensorium and the opercle, an elevation of the supraoccipital crest, a relative shortening of the mandible, and a lengthening of the ascending process of the premaxilla. Shape changes of the mandible in the two studied species also reflect an increase of biting capacities. The high disparity between adult shape results from differences in the rate and in the length of ontogenetic trajectories, from divergence of the ontogenetic trajectories (neurocranium, mandible, and premaxilla) and parallel shifts of the trajectories in the size-shape space (suspensorium and opercle). In an evolutionary context, allometric <b>heterochronies</b> during ontogeny of different skeletal unit of the head may be considered as a basis for the explanation of the diversity of damselfishes.

This strategy carries obvious benefits, but may also result in severe consequences for lecithotrophic larvae that run low on time and energy. Precocious activation of postlarval developmental programs—so-called anticipatory development—may be adaptive and increase the survival of older, energy-depleted larvae by allowing more rapid metamorphosis. Three of six solitary ascidian species displayed extensive anticipatory development of postlarval structures, similar to <b>heterochronies</b> normally observed for colonial species. The capacity for anticipatory development may be linked to the length of competent period, taxonomic group, or both: members of suborder Phlebobranchia exhibited extensive anticipatory development and long competent periods, but members of suborder Stolidobranchia exhibited little or no anticipatory development and had shorter competent periods. Delay of metamorphosis of up to 3 d did not negatively impact postlarval and juvenile growth rates for any of three species tested, regardless of taxonomic group or length of competent period, although a longer, 7 -d, delay resulted in slower postlarval growth in Ciona intestinalis. Anticipatory development of postlarval structures may ameliorate the negative consequences of delay of metamorphosis in C. intestinalis and Ascidiella aspersa, but Molgula socialis showed neither anticipatory development nor a negative impact of metamorphic delay on postlarval fitness. This is the first demonstration that anticipatory development of postlarval structures, normally associated only with colonial ascidians, can occur as a normal part of the development of solitary ascidians...|$|R
