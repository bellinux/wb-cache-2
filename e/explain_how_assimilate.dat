40|$|The {{controversial}} {{notion of}} "transnationalism" has generated {{new insights into}} international migrants' on-going ties with their communities of origin, but its problematic conceptualization and vague usage in empirical studies needlessly inhibit the transnational perspective's utility. Understanding {{the political and economic}} incorporation of migrants in both their communities of origin and destination is facilitated by disaggregating the types of political borders, types of nationalism, and levels of identification that have been conflated in the framework of "transnationalism". I demonstrate the analytic value of these distinctions by using them to interpret evidence from a six-month ethnographic case study of an immigrant labour union in Southern California. A theoretically coherent typology applicable to both the case study and other migration settings provides a framework for <b>explaining</b> <b>how</b> institutions <b>assimilate</b> migrants into U. S. and local politics while simultaneously promoting cross-border ties...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we empirically <b>explain</b> <b>how</b> {{scientific}} knowledge <b>assimilated</b> from academia affects corporate performance, {{particularly in the}} pharmaceutical industry of Japan. We use balanced panel data on 46 pharmaceutical firms in Japan for the period 1992 – 2005. Then, we introduce a new concept, propensity to capture basic research (PCBR), to index how much {{scientific knowledge}} firms have assimilated from universities and public research institutes. We use this index to verify whether absorption of such knowledge influences corporate performance. According to econometric analysis, PCBR is positively significant for patent applications and patent efficiency but not for number of approved drugs. This obviously implies that scientific knowledge assimilated from academia is effective for technological performance in firms. Moreover, the results suggest how R&D is structured in the organizational setup of Japanese pharmaceutical firms.
