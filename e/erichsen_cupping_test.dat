Tensile properties of these alloys were measured and their work hardening behaviour was analysed by using constitutive equations. Room temperature formability of the alloys was evaluated by the limiting dome height (LDH) value, obtained by the <b>Erichsen</b> <b>cupping</b> <b>test.</b> It shows {{that there is a}} linear relationship between LDH value and the inverse of yield ratio, which is a function of work hardening exponents.

40|$|The {{formability}} of AISI 202 {{austenitic stainless}} steel was {{compared with that of}} type AISI 304 stainless steel. Type 202 is a low-nickel {{austenitic stainless steel}} alloyed with manganese and nitrogen. In this study, the formability of the two grades was examined using <b>Erichsen</b> <b>cupping</b> <b>tests</b> and room temperature uniaxial tensile tests performed at various angles to the rolling direction. AISI 202 appears to work-harden at a slightly higher rate than AISI 304, even though the austenite in type 202 is more stable than that in 304 with respect to the formation of deformation-induced a¢ martensite. Although both grades are predicted to be susceptible to earing during deep drawing, AISI 202 displays a higher work-hardening exponent, higher average normal anisotropy, and a higher limiting drawing ratio than AISI 304. Similar cup heights were measured during <b>Erichsen</b> <b>cupping</b> <b>tests,</b> confirming that the two grades have very similar deep drawing properties. The results of this investigation therefore suggest that AISI 202 is a suitable alternative for AISI 304 in applications requiring good deep drawing properties...|$|R
40|$|Electron {{beam welding}} (EBW) {{technique}} {{was used to}} perform dissimilar joining of plain carbon steel to Fe- 7 %Al alloy under three different weld conditions such as with beam oscillation, without beam oscillation and at higher welding speed. The effect of weld parameters on the microstructure and mechanical properties of dissimilar joints was studied using optical microscopy, SEM, EBSD, hardness, tensile and <b>erichsen</b> <b>cup</b> <b>tests.</b> Microstructure {{results show that the}} application of beam oscillation resulted in uniform and homogeneous microstructure compared to without beam oscillations and higher welding speed. Further, it was observed that weld microstructure changes from equiaxed to columnar grains depending on the weld speed. High weld speed results in columnar grain structure in the weld joint. <b>Erichsen</b> <b>cup</b> <b>test</b> results show that the application of beam oscillation results in excellent formability as compared to high weld speed. Tensile test results show no significant difference in strength properties in all three weld conditions, but the ductility was found to be highest for joints obtained with the application of weld beam oscillation as compared to without beam oscillation and high weld speed. This study shows that the application of beam oscillations {{plays an important role in}} improving the weld quality and performance of EBW dissimilar steel to Fe-Al joints...|$|R
40|$|Laser welding {{has a large}} {{potential}} {{for the production of}} tailor welded blanks in the automotive industry, due to the low heat input and deep penetration. However, due to the small laser spot and melt pool, laser-based welding processes in general have a low tolerance for seam gaps. In this paper, five laser-based welding techniques are compared for their gap bridging capabilities: single-spot laser welding, twin-spot laser welding, single-spot laser welding with cold wire feeding, twin-spot laser welding with cold wire feeding and laser/GMA hybrid welding. Welding experiments were performed on 1. 1 - and 2. 1 -mm-thick AA 5182 aluminium sheets. The resulting welds were evaluated using visual inspection, cross sectional analysis with optical microscopy, tensile <b>tests</b> and <b>Erichsen</b> <b>Cupping</b> <b>tests.</b> The results show that the use of a filler wire is indispensable to increase the gap tolerance. A proper alignment of this wire with the laser spot(s) is crucial. With the single spot laser welding with cold wire feeding, a gap up to 0. 6 mm could be bridged as opposed to a maximum allowable gap width of 0. 2 mm for single-spot laser welding without filler wire. For 2. 1 -mm-thick sheets, the laser/GMA hybrid welding process can bridge even gaps up to 1. 0 mm. Most welds had a high tensile strength. However, during <b>Erichsen</b> <b>Cupping</b> <b>tests,</b> the deformation of the welds is significantly lower as compared to the base materia...|$|R

A number of different aging/heat treating procedures have been utilised that have resulted in significantly different mechanical properties. The cryo-rolled material was heat treated at 150 °C for varying times and the resulting mechanical properties evaluated {{as a function of}} this holding time. The resulting properties were found to be strongly influenced by precipitates that formed either during the aging step, rolling process or the subsequent heat treatment.

40|$|Abstract: Due to the induced {{effect of}} plastic {{deformation}} and markedly influence of contact friction, the surface topography of galvanized steels has changed along {{with time and}} space during the sheet metal forming. WykoNT 1100 non-contact optical profilometer {{was used to measure}} the surface topographies of different deformation zones in <b>Erichsen</b> <b>cupping</b> <b>test.</b> And the surface topography models of different deformation zones were established based on the statistical method. The results indicated that the surface topography was roughened with the increase of deformation and the degrees of roughening in different deformation zones were different. The function curve of micro-peak height in punch fillet zone which had serious deformation was relatively flat. It indicated that the data distributions were scattered, the roughness values were large and the zinc coating was severely exfoliated. However, the function curve in vertex zone was lanky with centralized data, small roughness values and intact zinc coating. Moreover, the surface topography was also affected by the contact friction...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis study {{demonstrates}} applying laser {{heat treatment}} for reversion treatments of cold-formed AISI 301 LN. Sheets were cold- rolled to final thicknesses of 1. 5 and 3 mm (65 pct reduction), having martensite fraction of 70 - 95 %. Sheets were heated locally by {{a laser beam}} to various peak temperatures to obtain different degrees of martensite reversion to austenite. Mechanical properties and formability of grain-refined and coarse-grained structures were measured by tensile, bending and <b>Erichsen</b> <b>cup</b> <b>tests.</b> In addition to standard <b>Erichsen</b> <b>cup</b> <b>test,</b> additional interrupted tests were carried out, where cups were first stretched close to the critical strain. Drawn cups were then heated locally by a laser beam to revitalize the structure and thereby enhance the formability in the following <b>cupping</b> <b>test</b> until failure. Various structures were produced: completely reverted microstructures (T > 700 °C) with grain sizes 0. 9 - 2 μm in addition to partially reverted structure (T < 700 °C) containing nano- and ultrafine-grained austenite (0. 6 μm) with some martensite. Results showed that local laser heat treatment is suitable for the reversion treatment to refine the austenite grain size. Refinement of the austenitic structures increased strength properties and the formability was better than with coarse grained structures having the same strength. Especially the yield strength was significantly enhanced, being around 900 MPa in the strongest reverted structure compared to the 300 - 400 MPa of the coarse grained austenitic structure. It was demonstrated that the local laser treatment restored formability of the drawn cups, allowing stretching to be continued...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{influences}} of thickness ratio of base sheets on formability of {{tailor welded blanks}} were examined based on <b>Erichsen</b> <b>cupping</b> <b>tests.</b> Three-dimensional finite element (FE) models, using Hill’ 48 yield criterion and iso-hardening rule, were built under {{the environment of the}} FE analysis software ABAQUS. The failure onset sites of tailor welded blanks were analysed and the quantitative relationships between the Erichsen index values and base thickness ratio were established. Based on these relationships, the formability of tailor welded blanks made from dissimilar base sheets are evaluated, provided that the Erichsen index values of tailor welded blanks made from identical ones are known and that the above two different types of tailor welded blanks undergo a similar stamping process. The experiments were then carried out to validate this method...|$|R

40|$|A 0. 5 wt pct C, 22 wt pct Mn {{austenitic}} steel, recently {{proposed for}} fabricating automotive body structures by cold sheet forming, exhibits plastic localizations (PLs) during uniaxial tensile tests, yet showing a favorable overall strength and ductility. No localization happens during biaxial <b>Erichsen</b> <b>cupping</b> <b>tests.</b> Full-thickness tensile and Erichsen specimens, cut from as-produced steel sheets, were polished and tested at different strain rates. During the tensile tests, the PL phenomena consist first of macroscopic deformation bands traveling along the tensile axis, {{and then of}} a series of successive stationary deformation bands, each adjacent to the preceding ones; both types of bands involve the full specimen width and yield a macroscopically observable surface relief. No comparable surface relief was observed during the standard Erichsen tests. Because the stress state is known to influence PL phenomena, reduced-width Erichsen tests were performed on polished sheet specimens, in order to explore the transition from biaxial to uniaxial loading; surface relief lines were observed on a 20 -mm-wide specimen, but not on wider ones...|$|R
40|$|Based on the {{continuum}} damage mechanics (CDM), both the total damage growth {{force and the}} damage equivalent stress has been firstly derived. Material and damage {{are considered to be}} anisotropic in this theoretical model. A new damage-based plastic yield criterion, where the damage equivalent stress is taken as the yield function, and the corresponding damage evolution equation has been established. A relation between the damage variable and the plastic deformation has been proposed. This relation can be applied to obtain the damage history in terms of Moiré photo-mechanics technology in this work. In addition, from the anisotropic damage-based plastic yield criterion presented, the large-scale finite element codes ABAQUS/Explicit in conjunction with the damage experimental results has been then used to calculate some mechanical variable fields in metal forming process.

40|$|Abstract. Sheet metal deep-draw die is {{primarily}} constructed with draw bead, {{which is then}} modified based on trial and error to obtain a successful forming without splitting. This work aims at a robust design of forming die using numerical analysis and the Taguchi method. A three dimensional elastoplastic finite element model of a sheet metal forming process of SPCEN steel has been successfully developed using the material flow stress obtained from the modified <b>Erichsen</b> <b>cup</b> <b>test.</b> The model was validated with the actual forming experiment and the results agreed well. The influence of draw bead parameters on splitting and thinning distributions were examined using the Taguchi method. Four parameters, namely the friction coefficient, draw bead height, radius and shoulder radius were investigated. The Taguchi main effect analysis and ANOVA {{results show that the}} height and shoulder radius of the draw bead are the most important factor influencing the thinning distribution. Applying the Taguchi method and using the minimum thinning percentage as the design criteria, the optimum die design was identified as height, radius, shoulder radius and the friction coefficient of 4, 8, 8 mm and 0. 125 respectively. The verified finite element model using the optimum die design was conducted. The predicted Taguchi response was within 5. 9 % from finite element analysis prediction. The improvement in the reduction of thinning percentage was 22. 35 %...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: of {{that paper}} was {{analysing}} main plastic properties of welds made by MIG method with micro-jet cooling. The main reason {{of it was}} investigate possibilities of getting better plastic properties of welds made by MIG method with micro-jet cooling than welds made by ordinary welding method. It is possible because higher amount of acicular ferrite (AF) in WMD (weld metal deposit) is obtained in MIG method with micro-jet cooling in relation to ordinary welding method. Design/methodology/approach: During research <b>Erichsen</b> <b>cupping</b> <b>tests</b> and bending tests were carried out for welds made by MIG method with micro-jet cooling and ordinary welding method. Findings: High amount of acicular ferrite influences positively on plastic properties. Higher value of plastic parameters were observed for welds made by MIG method with micro-jet cooling. Research limitations/implications: That research was made for MIG method only. Another method of welding was not tested. Other methods of welding have not been tested, but it is suspected that similar phenomena are taking place.
