40|$|In {{negligence}} law, <b>unavoidable</b> <b>accident</b> is {{the risk}} that remains when an actor has used due care. The counterpart <b>of</b> <b>unavoidable</b> <b>accident</b> is negligent harm. Negligence law makes parties immune for <b>unavoidable</b> <b>accident</b> even when they have used less than due care. Courts have developed a number of methods by which they sort <b>accidents</b> to <b>unavoidable</b> <b>accident</b> or to negligent harm, holding parties liable only for the latter. These sorting techniques are interesting {{in their own right}} and also provide a way of conceptualizing the relationship between specific negligence and res ipsa loquitur, which are two variants of the negligence rule. One judicial sorting technique reveals a paradox of negligence law. New safety technology often reduces the amount <b>of</b> <b>unavoidable</b> <b>accident</b> and simultaneously increases the expected number of compliance errors, or routine negligent lapses, that actors will make. Paradoxically, an actors use of new safety technology can make it more likely that a court will sort an accident to negligent harm as opposed to <b>unavoidable</b> <b>accident.</b> The article develops these theoretical ideas through a series of graphical illustrations analogous to those of traditional price theory. ...|$|R
40|$|In Moats v. Lienemann, the Nebraska Supreme Court affirmed a {{district}} court jury 2 ̆ 7 s determination that the automobile collision {{out of which}} the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s negligence action arose was not an 2 ̆ 2 <b>unavoidable</b> <b>accident</b> 2 ̆ 2. An <b>unavoidable</b> <b>accident</b> 2 ̆ 2 {{has been defined as}} an inevitable accident, an event or an occurrence which could not have been prevented by any human foresight or ordinary prudence, the result occurring without fault. 2 ̆ 2 The purpose of this casenote is to examine the conflicting considerations that concern the trial court when a defendant attempts to employ the <b>unavoidable</b> <b>accident</b> defense. In numerous jurisdictions, there is an increasing reluctance to use the <b>unavoidable</b> <b>accident</b> instruction because <b>of</b> a belief that the instruction unnecessarily confuses the jury. In {{what appears to be the}} majority of jurisdictions, however, trial courts permit use <b>of</b> the <b>unavoidable</b> <b>accident</b> instruction. In these jurisdictions, it is believed the <b>unavoidable</b> <b>accident</b> instruction assists the jury in focusing deliberations and inquiries on the specific factual questions at issue. The use of the instruction in Moats indicates that, despite this trend of abandoning the doctrine, the Nebraska Supreme Court favors utilization <b>of</b> the <b>unavoidable</b> <b>accident</b> instruction when pleadings and evidence properly raise and support the issue <b>of</b> <b>unavoidable</b> <b>accident</b> as a defense to a complaint premised on negligence. The Nebraska Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Moats reaffirmed the court 2 ̆ 7 s approval of the limited role that the <b>unavoidable</b> <b>accident</b> doctrine plays in negligence litigation...|$|R
40|$|How should {{autonomous}} vehicles (aka self-driving cars) {{be programmed}} to behave in the event <b>of</b> an <b>unavoidable</b> <b>accident</b> in which the only choice open is one between causing different damages or losses to different objects or persons? This paper addresses this ethical question starting from the normative principles elaborated in the law to regulate difficult choices in other emergency scenarios. In particular, the paper offers a rational reconstruction of some major principles and norms embedded in the Anglo-American jurisprudence and case law on the “doctrine of necessity”; and assesses which, if any, of these principles and norms can be utilized to find reasonable guidelines for solving the ethical issue of the regulation of the programming of autonomous vehicles in emergency situations. The paper covers the following topics: the distinction between “justification” and “excuse”, the legal prohibition of intentional killing outside self-defence, the incommensurability of goods, and the legal constrains {{to the use of}} lethal force set by normative positions: obligations, responsibility, rights, and authority. For each of these principles and constrains the possible application to the programming of autonomous vehicles is discussed. Based on the analysis, some practical suggestions are offered. </p...|$|R

40|$|The notion <b>of</b> an <b>unavoidable</b> set <b>of</b> words appears {{frequently}} {{in the fields of}} mathematics and theoretical computer science, in particular with its connection to the study of combinatorics on words. The theory <b>of</b> <b>unavoidable</b> sets has seen extensive study over the past twenty years. In this paper we extend the definition <b>of</b> <b>unavoidable</b> sets <b>of</b> words to <b>unavoidable</b> sets <b>of</b> partial words. Partial words, or finite sequences that may contain a number of “do not know ” symbols or “holes,” appear naturally in several areas of current interest such as molecular biology, data communication, and DNA computing. We demonstrate the utility of the notion of unavoidability of sets of partial words by making use of it to identify several new classes <b>of</b> <b>unavoidable</b> sets <b>of</b> full words. Along the way we begin work on classifying the <b>unavoidable</b> sets <b>of</b> partial words of small cardinality. We pose a conjecture, and show that affirmative proof of this conjecture gives a sufficient condition for classifying all the <b>unavoidable</b> sets <b>of</b> partial words of size two. We give a result which makes the conjecture easy to verify for a significant number of cases. We characterize many forms <b>of</b> <b>unavoidable</b> sets <b>of</b> partial words of size three over a binary alphabet, and completely characterize such sets over a ternary alphabet. Finally, we extend our results to <b>unavoidable</b> sets <b>of</b> partial words of size k over a k-letter alphabet. ∗This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foun...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Although the {{advancement}} of technology can provide a better and safer working environment to people, sometimes, overconfidence in technology can lead to <b>unavoidable</b> <b>accidents</b> and human errors in the workplace. This study aims {{to determine the effects}} of familiarity with office equipment on human errors and accidents in the workplace. A total of 150 surveys were collected and analysed with correlations analysis usingSPSS software version 19. 0. The results show that although familiarity can reduce the occurrence of human errors, it cannot reduce the occurrence of accidents in the workplace. While it is now understood that improving one's familiarity with office equipment can potentially reduce their mistakes at work, companies should still be observant of other factors that can potentially reduce accidents in the workplace. This study sheds light on potential possibilities to improve the occupational safety, health and environment of organizations...|$|R
50|$|Mudplaning is {{the loss}} of {{traction}} of a wheel when the pavement is covered by a very thin layer of sand and waste oils. It may occur during the first rainfall (or through other means of dampening) on a specific area which has been dry for a period of time. When the rain first falls down, the thin layer of dust mixes with waste oils and turns into a nearly transparent layer of grease. The color of asphalt remains as usual while the underlying mixture may still cause a critical loss of traction comparable to that of driving on rime ice. When the rain totally washes the pavement off the grease, the effects of mudplaning will be mitigated. The whole phenomenon is similar to the formation of black ice which has been responsible for many <b>unavoidable</b> <b>accidents</b> on highways.|$|R

The globalization of ever-more growth and consumption has come, however, at a price: global chains of cause-and-effect that obscure social, environmental and ethical responsibility.

The history of what most call traffic "accidents" is revealing. The hope at the 1896 inquest into the first "accidental death" was this would never happen again. But hope is not action. Today, traffic injures as many as 50 million and kills over one million people ever year. It is, however, no accident that tragedies like these are "accidents" rather than "sacrifices," as such language softens criticism of the moral, social and ecological crises arising from the current global consumptive order.
