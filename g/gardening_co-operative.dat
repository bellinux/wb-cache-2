500|$|Goregaon’s <b>Garden</b> Estate <b>Co-operative</b> Housing Society asked Tijori and {{his family}} to vacate their house in November 2012, {{following}} complaints from their neighbours. The Tijori family had been living there since 2009. The residents of the building accused them of behaving rudely, not paying charges on time, insulting the society's office bearers and bringing disrepute to them. After a general meeting of the members, the society passed a resolution and sent a notice to Tijori, asking him to vacate his flats within the next 30 days.

Tijori called the legal proceedings a [...] "long nightmarish battle" [...] and accused the society for charging wrongful maintenance money.|$|R
50|$|The {{connections}} between the <b>garden</b> city and <b>co-operative</b> movements {{go back to the}} 1870s and 1880s when Ebenezer Howard was moving in radical circles which included utopian community builders and land reformers. But the practical link came in 1901 when London lawyer and chairman of the Labour Association, Ralph Neville, was persuaded by Howard to become chair of the Garden City Association (GCA). Neville introduced Howard to a group of wealthy and influential people who had already invested in the Ealing project. By 1903, this group was ready to invest in the Letchworth project. Two years later the link was sealed when Vivian brought in GCA architects Unwin and Parker to work on the Ealing project.|$|R

She received the Italian Medal for Valour for her work with the Anglo-Italian Red Cross on the Italian-Austrian front during the First World War from 1916-19. She was awarded the OBE in 1920. From 1920-22, she was in Turkey where she started a committee to deal with Russian refugees and later ran a co-operative farm colony in Asia Minor. She went to Russia in 1932, with Lady Muriel Paget’s Mission. She was instrumental in securing Ashridge Estate to the National Trust. In 1937 she took over joint ownership of Kiplin Hall in North Yorkshire. She retained an interest in the estate throughout the rest of her life. She invented a watertight electric torch for lifebelts and was instrumental in getting these made compulsory by Parliament for all MN, RAF and RN personnel, and so saved hundreds of lives during the Second World War.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{document}} and make proposals for action to Lillhagen greenhouse facility, with consideration to its historic and cultural characteristics. Based on literature and archival studies, the essay reports the historical facts concerning the greenhouse as a building type and furthermore Lillhagen hospital and the greenhouse facility. The facility was originally a part of the former psychiatric hospital Lillhagen, which is located close-by the greenhouses, in Skogome in the municipality of Gothenburg. Then, its purpose was to provide the hospital with vegetables and plants but also served as part of the occupational therapy practised at the hospital, keeping the inmates at work in the greenhouses and the park surrounding the hospital area. Nowadays, it is run as a market <b>garden,</b> by a <b>co-operative</b> called Multikult. A description of the greenhouses and the buildings connected to it is presented, along with a valuation of the cultural and historic aspects the facility holds. Prior to the proposals, studies were made of two other greenhouses which recently have been restored/renovated, in order to gain knowledge of what might be suitable suggestions for the greenhouses of Lillhagen. The proposals, the first one having a conservationist’s perspective, are based on the valuation made earlier. The second one is a compromise between the ideas of proper conservation and those of Multikult and their needs for an everyday usage of the space and their financial situation. This essay also makes note of and discusses the fact that there has been a constant reduction of a lot of the small scale market gardens, with greenhouses that hold cultural and historical values, in the region of Västra Götaland, and hence there are not many left today. However, this is probably not just a regional phenomenon, but nationwide. This study has only kept a regional focus, though. There is no data on how many of this kind of greenhouse facilities that exists today, since no inspection or survey has been carried out. Overall, the focus concerning greenhouses within the conservation of built heritage in Sweden has often been that of orangeries and houses of the upperclass settings.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} Co-operative Model Town Society Lahore; a town {{covering}} {{an area of}} around 2000 acres developed in the 1920 ’s in the (then) suburbs of Lahore, capital of Punjab province in British India. The Town is a remarkable interpretation of Ebenezer Howard’s Garden City ideals and the co-operative principles. However, the real significance of the town is it being a unique example of a <b>co-operative</b> <b>garden</b> town built by the local Indian bourgeois, majority of whom were forced to migrate due to the disturbances that followed after {{the declaration of independence}} to India and Pakistan in 1947. Despite the admiration and significance of the Town in the realm of pre and post-Independence Lahore, very little has been documented about it. Its formal documented history is non-existent while its original built environment, an excellent example to illustrate late-colonial architecture in the region, is diminishing rapidly due to negligence and reconstructions. The aim of this research is the documentation of history, urban form, social character and architecture of the pre-independence Model Town. Consequently, through an analysis of its built environment this study intends to develop an insight into the colonizer-colonized cultural transfers, in particular, to the transformation of British town planning ideas in the colonies due to their interpretation by the local Indians under the influence of prevalent religious, cultural and social practices. The research was conducted by the process of historical construction, whereby evidences from the documents and the built environment have been used collectively to develop the historiography of the town. The selection of primary material has been based on its availability as the documentary evidences are scattered across Pakistan, India and the UK. The built environment has been documented using the official drawings as well as onsite surveys and measurements where the original drawings are unavailable. The Town has been analysed in a comparative setting with respect to contemporary urban, architectural and social trends and practices prevalent locally (both by the colonial rulers and the colonized natives) as well as global movements, especially Western ideologies and perspectives and their retrospect local adaptations. The documentation and analysis were used as a ground for four interpretative conclusions. The first conclusion elaborates on the need of urban historiography in Pakistan. The second conclusion interprets the Model Town in the realm of twentieth century urban planning in the region. The third conclusion elaborates on the colonial architectural styles. The fourth conclusion gives an insight into the Model Town with reference to western styled ‘Indian’ nationalism...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Commerce, Law and Management, Graduate School of Business Administration, 2014. The last 20 {{years have}} {{witnessed}} {{a proliferation of}} literature on social entrepreneurship. However, this body of work has not adequately considered the phenomenon {{from the perspective of}} social enterprise participants across different contexts. To address this shortcoming, this thesis focused on exploring an “insider view” on the rationale and nature of social enterprise in the South African context. Attention was paid to the shared experiences, evolution, resource-mobilisation strategies and overall purpose of social enterprise. What was of interest in South Africa was how social enterprises contribute to social needs, as this could provide insights into whether this phenomenon provides a complementary solution to the country’s socio-economic development backlogs. The research methodology considered appropriate to answer the research questions of the thesis was the interpretive constructivist case study which sought to understand social enterprise in terms of the subjectively-constructed reality of its actors. The empirical material consisted of four South African case studies of social enterprise in the education, healthcare, food security, and enterprise-development sectors. The four case studies were: Life College, a Gauteng-based educational project that develops psychosocial skills among disadvantaged youth nationally; Magema <b>Gardens,</b> a Jozini-based <b>co-operative</b> engaged in food security; The International Centre for Eyecare Education (name subsequently changed to the Brien Holden Vision Institute), an eye healthcare organisation focused on the prevention of avoidable blindness across Africa; and KwaXolo Crafters, an Ulundi-based co-operative that trades in traditional craft artefacts for enterprise development. A total number of 53 participants were involved in the interviews and focus groups which included the founding parties, their teams, and stakeholders. The research data sources were the document review, interviews, focus groups and field notes. The raw data from each data source was coded. The codes were then grouped into code families, and the code families were grouped into themes. During the coding process attention was paid to ensuring the v preservation of the language and voice of the research participants from the raw data through to the grouping of the themes. The themes provided the basis for within-case analysis and cross-case analysis. The outcomes of the research provided valuable insights into the nature, practice and impact of social entrepreneurship. The evolution of the social enterprises was intertwined with the socio-political and economic struggle {{to meet the needs of}} South Africans. The identified social needs remained unmet after the advent of democracy and the four social enterprises continue their social mission work. During the evolution process, the need for resource mobilisation led to innovative responses to meeting social needs. Foremost in the minds of the social actors was their aspiration of sustainable social impact. The cross-cutting themes that emerged pointed to sustainability and social impact being the prominent constructs of social entrepreneurship. Accordingly the findings on sustainability and social impact provided a basis for proposing a theoretical framework aimed at securing greater insight into the concept of social entrepreneurship, and advancing scholarly research in South African social entrepreneurship. The original contribution of the theoretical framework in this thesis is that it provides a link to and point of convergence between the subjective experience of the social entrepreneurship community and the emerging literature on social entrepreneurship. It also strengthens the theoretical underpinnings of social entrepreneurship and expands the understanding of how social entrepreneurship is experienced by its actors...|$|R
