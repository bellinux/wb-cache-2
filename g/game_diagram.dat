40|$|PURPOSE : The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present the gathering, {{integration}} and analysis of digital information sources for the creation of a conceptual framework for alternate reality games (ARGs). ARGs hold potential for libraries, education, healthcare and many other sectors. DESIGN / METHODOLOGY / APPROACH : Case studies were performed on three previously played ARGs to create case reports. The various digital information sources for each game, sourced from multiple media, are compiled into a chronologically ordered game narrative which formed the case reports. The focus of the paper is on the analysis of the case reports using constant comparative analysis to identify categories and subcategories. Relationships are established, based on each game, between the categories and subcategories to inform the creation of <b>game</b> <b>diagrams.</b> The <b>game</b> <b>diagrams</b> are then combined to create a conceptual framework that describes the functioning and components of an ARG. FINDINGS : The conceptual framework effectively described the types of information found within an ARG as well as how these different categories of information interact and link to one another. The framework also provides an abstract description of the components of ARGs, namely narrative, game actions and community. ORIGINALITY /VALUE : The conceptual framework produced by the analysis enables an understanding of ARGs and how they are played and designed. Insight into how to analyse ARGs based on the information generated for the play of the game by both the players and the game designers is gained. Where other studies have provided insight into the phenomena of ARGs, this study focuses on constructing a conceptual framework of ARGs using the information generated by the game.

Reactive synthesis constructs a controller which satisfies a given specification, if one exists. For energy games a synthesized controller ensures to satisfy not only the safety constraints of the specification but also the quantitative constraints expressed in the energy game. A symbolic algorithm for energy games, recently presented by Chatterjee et al., is symbolic in its representation of quantitative values but concrete in the representation of game states and transitions. In this paper we present an algorithm that is symbolic both in the quantitative values and in the underlying game representation. We have implemented our algorithm using two different symbolic representations for reactive <b>games,</b> Binary Decision <b>Diagrams</b> (BDD) and Algebraic Decision Diagrams (ADD). We investigate the commonalities and differences of the two implementations and compare their running times on specifications of energy games.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} an information-driven sensor management problem, {{referred to as}} treasure hunt, which is rele-vant to mobile-sensor applications such as mine hunting, monitor-ing, and surveillance. The objective is to infer a hidden variable or treasure by selecting a sequence of measurements associated with multiple fixed targets distributed in the sensor workspace. The workspace is represented by a connectivity graph, where each node represents a possible sensor deployment, and the arcs repre-sent possible sensor movements. An additive conditional entropy reduction function is presented to efficiently compute the expected benefit of a measurement sequence over time. Then, the optimal treasure hunt strategy is determined by a novel label-correcting algorithm operating on the connectivity graph. The methodol-ogy is illustrated through the board game of CLUE, which is {{shown to be a}} benchmark example of the treasure hunt problem. The game results show that a computer player implementing the strategies developed in this paper outperforms players implement-ing Bayesian networks, Q-learning, or constraint satisfaction, as well as human players.

40|$|A simple {{game is a}} pair {{consisting}} of a finite set N of players {{and a set of}} winning coalitions. (Vector-) weighted majority games ((V) WMG) are a special case of simple games, in which an integer (vector) weight can be assigned to each player and there is a quota which a coalition has to achieve in order to win. Binary decision diagrams (BDDs) are used as compact representations for Boolean functions and sets of subsets. This paper shows, how a quasi-reduced and ordered BDD (QOBDD) of the winning coalitions of a (V) WMG can be build, how one can compute the minimal winning coalitions and how one can easily compute the Banzhaf, Shapley-Shubik, Holler-Packel and Deegan-Packel indices of the players. E. g. in case of weighted majority games it is shown that the Banzhaf and Holler-Packel indices of all players can be computed in expected time and in general, the Banzhaf indices can be computed in time linear {{in the size of the}} QOBDD representation of the winning coalitions. Other running times are proven as well. The algorithms were tested on some real world games, e. g. the International Monetary Fund and the EU Treaty of Nice.

40|$|This paper aims to {{significantly}} impact {{the way we}} conceive of, reason about, and construct software for economic game theory. We achieve this by building an new and original model of economic games based upon the computer science idea of compositionality: concretely we i) give a number of operators for building up complex and irregular games from smaller and simpler games; and ii) show how the equilibria of these complex games can be defined recursively from the equilibria of their simpler components. We apply compositional reasoning to sophisticated games where agents must reason about how their actions effect future games and how those future games effect the utility they receive. This requires further originality in that we augment the usual lexicon of games with a new concept of coutility. This notion [...] - dual to utility [...] - arises because, in order for games to accept utility, this utility must be generated by other games. A third source of originality is the representation of our <b>games</b> as string <b>diagrams</b> so as to give a clear visual interface to manipulate them. Our fourth, and final, source of originality is a categorical formalisation of these intuitive string diagrams which guarantees our model is mathematically rigourous...|$|R
40|$|Air combat is {{a complex}} situation, {{training}} for it and analysis of possible tactics are time consuming and expensive. In order to circumvent those problems, mathematical models of air combat can be used. This thesis presents air combat as a one-on-one influence <b>diagram</b> <b>game</b> where the influence diagram allows {{the dynamics of the}} aircraft, the preferences of the pilots and the uncertainty of decision making in a structural and transparent way to be taken into account. To obtain the players’ game optimal control sequence with respect to their preferences, the influence diagram has to be solved. This is done by truncating the diagram with a moving horizon technique and determining and implementing the optimal controls for a dynamic game which only lasts a few time steps. The result is a working air combat model, where a player estimates the probability that it resides in any of four possible states. The pilot’s preferences are modeled by utility functions, one for each possible state. In each time step, the players are maximizing the cumulative sum of the utilities for each state which each possible action gives. These are weighted with the corresponding probabilities. The model is demonstrated and evaluated in a few interesting aspects. The presented model offers a way of analyzing air combat tactics and maneuvering as well as a way of making autonomous decisions in for example air combat simulators. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to develop a conceptual framework for alternate reality games based on game design theory. Alternate reality games or ARGs are a unique form of game that enables people to collaboratively play a game that is not a game {{in the context of the}} real world. To understand ARGs one needs to understand what differentiates them from other types of games as well as what makes them games. The research investigates existing literature of alternate reality games as well literature in the field of game studies to develop a set of characteristics for alternate reality games based on game design theory. Case studies are done on three different ARGs and summaries for the games are created. The phenomena in the summaries are placed into categories and subcategories. The categories and subcategories are developed by analysing the game summaries using constant comparative analysis. Using the categories, subcategories and the relationship between them, diagrams are created for each of the studied ARGs. A detailed analysis of each game is done and a summary diagram is created for each <b>game.</b> The summary <b>diagrams</b> are then combined to create a generalizable diagram for ARGs. The combination of the theoretical framework developed during the literature study together with the generalizable diagram from the analysis of the three games are then combined to create a conceptual framework. The conceptual framework creates a deeper understanding of ARGs and the various phenomena found within them by building on game design theory found in the field of game studies. The conceptual framework can aid in the creation of ARGs as well as enable the further analysis of these games.

V prvem delu smo spoznali teorijo iger. Skozi kratek zgodovinski pregled smo spoznali nastanke teorije iger in pomembne izsledke matematikov, ki so delovali na tem področju. V nadaljevanju smo opredelili osnovne pojme teorije iger in definicijo igre ter igralca. Prav tako smo okarakterizirali posamezne tipe iger, njihove lastnosti, način igranja in poiskali Nasheva ravnovesja iger za vsak tip igre. Drugi del diplomske naloge preučuje igro ocenjevanja med profesorji in študenti. V opisu igre smo spoznali kontekst igre, število ocen, trajanje igre, tip igre, tabelo igre, diagram poteka igre, opis igralcev in njihova plačila in si ogledali posamezne dvoboje in plačila, ki nastopijo ob igri različnih strategij. Uvedli smo tri komponente plačilne funkcije: znanje, prosti čas in oceno. Poiskali smo optimalno situacijo v šolstvu, ki bi motivirala študente in profesorje k čim boljšemu delu in na ta način predlagali izboljšave, ki vodijo do boljšega znanja študentov. Z analizo igre v različnih situacijah, ki nastanejo ob različni obtežitvi komponent plačil, smo ugotovili, da lahko izberemo tak sistem nagrajevanja, v katerem nastopi Nashevo ravnovesje natanko tedaj, ko profesor izbereta strategijo 2 ̆ 7 vloži veliko truda in realno oceni 2 ̆ 7 in študent izbereta strategijo 2 ̆ 7 vloži veliko truda in realno oceni 2 ̆ 7 ali strategijo 2 ̆ 7 vloži veliko truda in nerealno oceni 2 ̆ 7.

With the help of the Nash equilibrium we determined optimal conditions and motivation in school system which would stimulate both the students and professors to do their best and as such would contribute to better education.

Through a brief history review we get to know how the game theory has developed and some important results of mathematicians that were active in this field. Further we defined the basic concepts of the game theory and definition of the game and its player. We characterized individual game types, their characteristics, the way of play and defined the Nash equilibrium for each type of the game. The second part studies the grading game between professors and students. In the description of the game we get to know the game contexts, number of grades, game duration, game type, <b>game</b> table, <b>diagram</b> of the <b>game</b> course, description of the players and their payouts. We also examined individual duels and their payouts that are the results of different game strategies. We introduced three components of the utility function: knowledge, spare time, grade and then looked for the optimum situation in educational system that would motivate students and professors to do their best. By doing this we then suggested improvements in the system that would lead to better student knowledge. With game analysis in different situations which are the result of different weights of the components we established that in the game with four-level knowledge reward system respecting certain rational assumptions on relative weights of utility function components, it is possible to design utility functions, such that Nash equilibrium of the game is for the professor to choose the strategy of quality work and realistic grading and for the student to choose the strategy of quality work and realistic grading or the strategy of quality work and nonrealistic grading...|$|R
