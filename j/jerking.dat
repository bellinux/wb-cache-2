5|$|Termites rely {{on alarm}} {{communication}} {{to defend a}} colony. Alarm pheromones can be released when the nest has been breached or is being attacked by enemies or potential pathogens. Termites always avoid nestmates infected with Metarhizium anisopliae spores, through vibrational signals released by infected nestmates. Other methods of defence include intense <b>jerking</b> and secretion of fluids from the frontal gland and defecating faeces containing alarm pheromones.|$|E

Automatisms may occur, which are non-consciously-generated activities and mostly simple repetitive movements like smacking of the lips or more complex activities such as attempts to pick up something.|$|E
5|$|Central {{nervous system}} oxygen {{toxicity}} manifests as {{symptoms such as}} visual changes (especially tunnel vision), ringing in the ears (tinnitus), nausea, twitching (especially of the face), behavioural changes (irritability, anxiety, confusion), and dizziness. This may {{be followed by a}} tonic–clonic seizure consisting of two phases: intense muscle contraction occurs for several seconds (tonic phase); followed by rapid spasms of alternate muscle relaxation and contraction producing convulsive <b>jerking</b> (clonic phase). The seizure ends with a period of unconsciousness (the postictal state). The onset of seizure depends upon the partial pressure of oxygen in the breathing gas and exposure duration. However, exposure time before onset is unpredictable, as tests have shown a wide variation, both amongst individuals, and in the same individual from day to day. In addition, many external factors, such as underwater immersion, exposure to cold, and exercise will decrease the time to onset of central nervous system symptoms. Decrease of tolerance is closely linked to retention of carbon dioxide. Other factors, such as darkness and caffeine, increase tolerance in test animals, but these effects have not been proven in humans.|$|E

5|$|The {{accident}} {{began on}} the front straightaway as the field headed into turn one. Wade Cunningham, Wheldon's teammate in the No. 17 Dallara, clipped James Hinchcliffe, driving the No. 06 Dallara, and then made contact with J. R. Hildebrand in the No. 4 Dallara. Then Cunningham swerved and Hildebrand drove over the rear of his car, causing his to go airborne. Cunningham collected Jay Howard in the No. 15 Dallara {{on the inside and}} then Townsend Bell in the No. 22 Dallara on the outside before colliding with the retaining wall. Attempting to avoid the crash ahead, Vitor Meira lost control of his No. 14 Dallara and spun inward, collecting both Charlie Kimball's No. 83 Dallara and E. J. Viso's No. 59 Dallara. Tomas Scheckter, in the No. 57 Dallara, was also attempting to avoid the crash by rapidly slowing down on the outside. Following that, Paul Tracy ran into the back of his car with his No. 8 Motegi Wheels Dallara and Pippa Mann, rapidly approaching in the No. 30 Dallara, went over the top of him after <b>jerking</b> to the outside to avoid crashing into Alex Lloyd in the No. 19 Dallara.|$|E
5|$|The {{next night}} at 1945 hrs, a craft {{similar to the}} one the night before {{approached}} the base. In addition to being tracked on radar, it hovered around the area for 30 minutes, with characteristics of movement similar to a helicopter. Additionally, it hovered above the weapons storage area at the same altitude as the night before. At this time, possibly another object (it is unclear if it was the same one as the over the weapons storage area, but it is possible) was spotted over the flightline. The cigar-shaped object was described as hovering in mid-air, <b>jerking</b> around, and turning on and off its lights once. During the blackout, it traveled from the flightline, to the northern end of the runway. According to one service member, the object was chased, and eventually discovered to be hovering five feet off the ground. During this time, it was determined that the object was four car lengths long.|$|E
5|$|Atlantic puffins are {{cautious}} {{when approaching}} the colony and no bird likes {{to land in}} a location where other puffins are not already present. They make several circuits of the colony before alighting. On the ground they spend much time preening, spreading oil from their preen gland and setting each feather in its correct position with beak or claw. They also spend time standing by their burrow entrances and interacting with passing birds. Dominance is shown by an upright stance, with fluffed chest feathers and cocked tail, an exaggerated slow walk, head <b>jerking</b> and gaping. Submissive birds lower their head and hold their body horizontal and scurry past dominant individuals. Birds normally signal their intention to take off by briefly lowering their body before running down the slope to gain momentum. If a bird is startled and takes off unexpectedly, a panic can spread through the colony with all the birds launching themselves {{into the air and}} wheeling around in a great circle. The colony is at its most active in the evening, with birds standing outside their burrows, resting on the turf or strolling around. Then the slopes empty for the night as the birds fly out to sea to roost, often choosing to do so at fishing grounds ready for early morning provisioning.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Both {{the minimum}} energy {{consumption}} and smoothness, which is quantified {{as a function}} of <b>jerk,</b> are generally needed in many dynamic systems such as the automobile and the pick-and-place robot manipulator that handles fragile equipments. Nevertheless, many researchers come up with either solely concerning on the minimum energy consumption or minimum <b>jerk</b> trajectory. This research paper proposes a simple yet very interesting relationship between the minimum direct and indirect <b>jerks</b> approaches in designing the time-dependent system yielding an alternative optimal solution. Extremal solutions for the cost functions of direct and indirect <b>jerks</b> are found using the dynamic optimization methods together with the numerical approximation. This is to allow us to simulate and compare visually and statistically the time history of control inputs employed by minimum direct and indirect <b>jerk</b> designs. By considering minimum indirect <b>jerk</b> problem, the numerical solution becomes much easier and yields to the similar results as minimum direct <b>jerk</b> problem.

40|$|This study {{compared}} the biomechanical {{characteristics of the}} log lift and clean and <b>jerk.</b> Six experienced male strongman athletes performed log lifts and clean and <b>jerks</b> at 70 % of their 1 RM clean and <b>jerk.</b> Significant (p< 0. 05) between-exercise kinematic differences were observed throughout all the lifting phases, except at lift completion. The log lift demonstrated significantly greater trunk (↑ 24 %) and hip (↑ 9 %) range of motion than the clean and <b>jerk.</b> Significantly greater peak bar velocities were achieved in the clean and <b>jerk</b> in the second pull (16 %) and the <b>jerk</b> (↑ 14 %). While similarities existed in ground reaction force data between the lifts, mean and peak powers were significantly greater (↑ 40 % to ↑ 64 %) in propulsive phases of the clean and <b>jerk.</b> The log lift may be an effective conditioning stimulus to teach rapid triple extension while generating similar vertical and anteriorpropulsive forces as the clean and <b>jerk</b> with the same given load...|$|R
40|$|This paper announces an eight-term novel 3 -D <b>jerk</b> {{chaotic system}} with three {{quadratic}} nonlinearities. The phase {{portraits of the}} novel <b>jerk</b> chaotic system are displayed and the qualitative properties of the <b>jerk</b> system are described. The novel <b>jerk</b> chaotic system has two equilibrium points, which are saddle-foci and unstable. The Lyapunov exponents of the novel <b>jerk</b> chaotic system are obtained as L 1 = 0. 20572,L 2 = 0 and L 3 = − 1. 20824. Since {{the sum of the}} Lyapunov exponents of the <b>jerk</b> chaotic system is negative, we conclude that the chaotic system is dissipative. The Kaplan-Yorke dimension of the novel <b>jerk</b> chaotic system is derived as DKY = 2. 17026. Next, an adaptive controller is designed via backstepping control method to globally stabilize the novel <b>jerk</b> chaotic system with unknown parameters. Moreover, an adaptive controller is also designed via backstepping control method to achieve global chaos synchronization of the identical <b>jerk</b> chaotic systems with unknown parameters. The backstepping control method is a recursive procedure that links the choice of a Lyapunov function with the design of a controller and guarantees global asymptotic stability of strict feedback systems. MATLAB simulations have been depicted to illustrate the phase portraits of the novel <b>jerk</b> chaotic system and also the adaptive backstepping control results...|$|R

25|$|Stiff-limb {{syndrome}} is {{a variant of}} SPS. This syndrome develops into full SPS about 25 percent of the time. Stiffness and spasms are usually limited to the legs and hyperlordoisis generally does not occur. The stiffness begins in one limb and remains most prominent there. Sphincter and brainstem issues often occur with stiff-limb syndrome. Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity, another variant of the condition, includes symptoms of SPS with brainstem issues and autonomic disturbances. It involves polio-encephalomyelitis in the spine and brainstem. There is cerebellar and brainstem involvement. In some cases, the limbic system is affected, as well. Most patients have upper motoneuron issues and autonomic disturbances. <b>Jerking</b> man syndrome or <b>jerking</b> SPS is another subtype of the condition.

40|$|<b>Jerk</b> is {{the time}} rate of {{acceleration}} and mainly represents the nonstationary component in high frequency band of the earthquake wave. The study on <b>jerk</b> and its response spectra can enhance {{the recognition of the}} nonstationary ground motion. The mechanical meaning and research value of <b>jerk</b> are described. <b>Jerk</b> is recommended to be solved by establishing state-space equations and Runge-Kutta method. The solution method of elastic and inelastic <b>jerk</b> response spectra under ground motion is established, and the accurate <b>jerk</b> spectrum should be calculated directly according to numerical computing instead of pseudo-acceleration spectrum. The characteristics of <b>jerk</b> response spectra are studied according to the influencing factors, such as site condition, amplification factor, ductility factor, and reduction factor. The concept of impact reduction factor is presented. The statistical results show that the <b>jerk</b> spectrum has similar rules as the acceleration spectrum, and the amplitude is relative to the predominant period, especially for structures with short or medium period. If the ductility is improved, the effective <b>jerk</b> will reduce obviously, and the impact reduction factor will be enhanced. Different from the strength reduction factor, the impact reduction factor is nearly not relevant to the period...|$|R
40|$|The {{internal}} {{magnetic field}} of Earth {{is generated by}} dynamo processes in the fluid outer core, variations in flow resulting in the constantly changing form of the magnetic field. The rapid dynamics of the core are largely unknown; the mantle and crust filter and mask small-scale spatial and temporal features and field sources external to the Earth contaminate the limited observations. Geomagnetic <b>jerks</b> represent the most rapid observed variations of the internal field, {{on the scale of}} months, and are poorly understood. <b>Jerks</b> are sharp changes between periods of an otherwise linear rate of change of the field. The main aims of this thesis are: to systematically catalogue observations of <b>jerks,</b> focussing on 1957 – 2008, and to quantify their characteristics; to assess how representative observations of <b>jerks</b> are through synthetic field modelling; and to evaluate what the results of these analyses inform us {{about the nature of the}} source of <b>jerks</b> in the core. I identify <b>jerks</b> in observations via a two-step method, removing contaminating external signal before identifying possible times at which a simple <b>jerk</b> model produces a good fit to data. I quantify the properties of the model and fit, providing uncertainty estimates, all with minimal prior information on the occurrences of <b>jerks.</b> <b>Jerks</b> are found to be frequent, regional and not globally contemporaneous. <b>Jerks</b> are identified every year but with relative abundance in 1968 – 71, 1973 – 74, 1977 – 79, 1983 – 85, 1989 – 93, 1995 – 98 and 2002 – 03. The amplitudes of <b>jerks</b> in Europe are seen to vary periodically, suggesting a regular generation mechanism. Limited observations preclude a global assessment of this. I create stochastic synthetic field models to assess the significance of observations and to infer compatible <b>jerk</b> characteristics. These models reinforce the view that <b>jerks</b> occur in localised patches at the Earth's surface without a consistent temporal or spatial distribution. Spherical harmonic (SH) analysis of the synthetic and observed <b>jerks</b> suggests that despite the localised nature of <b>jerk</b> signals, they can be represented by a potential field with most power below SH degree 4. A lag time of 6 months between variations in Earth's rotation and geomagnetic <b>jerks</b> suggests that sufficiently electrically conductive material must be present in the lower 130 km of the mantle. At the core-mantle boundary, the power spectrum of the SH <b>jerk</b> models and the demonstrated ability to model <b>jerks</b> with a stochastic process, indicates a chaotic, turbulent core-surface flow regime is a likely generation mechanism. ...|$|R
