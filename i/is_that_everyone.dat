5|$|Voting is {{regarded}} as key to representative democracy, which requires that the leaders of a country are elected by the people. The basis of this concept <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> should be treated equally and everyone has equal rights. Every person, therefore, {{has a right to}} one vote, and no more, in the choice of representatives. The right to vote is a primary right, a right of fundamental importance by which other rights are protected. It is one of the important bulwarks of a representative democracy and in this regard, the ballot box is the people's ultimate mechanism to control the shaping of government policies. However, it must be recognized that voting is not an infallible litmus test for democracy; rather, it functions as a procedural device that is normally regarded as the best instrument for securing the ideal of self-governance.|$|E
5|$|Professor Onassis, {{who invented}} the time machine in the 1800s, arrives in the {{original}} version of the machine soon after and future Candace steals it. She travels back to the day the boys built the rollercoaster in their backyard and succeeds in getting her mother to see them, finally fulfilling her dream of busting them. However, in doing so, she accidentally leads Perry, their pet platypus who is secretly a suave secret agent, to be injured while stopping an evil magnet mechanism. As a result, Perry's nemesis, Dr. Doofenshmirtz, comes out unharmed {{from the effects of}} the now-destroyed machine. Over time, everything is altered and the Tri-State Area becomes childproof for fear of a repeat of Phineas and Ferb's dangerous activities. Doofenshmirtz eventually gains the upper hand, effectively becoming the ruler. He claims to be a nice Emperor, though, since he can remember everyone's name (though this is considerably easier than it seems, since one of his rules <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> has to be named Joe and requires everyone to wear lab coats at all times). Also, because of Doofenshmirtz succeeding, the Agency is now forced into a oath to obey him, resulting a demoralized Perry to fail more on his missions against Doofenshmirtz and is forbidden to use the time machine that Candace previously used as suggested by Major Monogram. After arriving in the dystopian future Doofenshmirtz rules, Candace finds the time machine in a junk yard and returns to the day of the rollercoaster to stop herself from interfering like before, stopping the dystopia from occurring.|$|E

25|$|Kabbalah Centre {{teaches the}} Kabbalistic concept of Klippot. The idea <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> {{has a direct}} and clear {{connection}} to the upper metaphysical-spiritual world of the Light (Ein Sof, unbounded God), but that this channel is blocked by Klippot, restricting the spiritual energy from entering the physical body. It is through study and practice of Kabbalah teachings and Jewish law (which the Kabbalah Centre says is early Rabbinistic construction to aid in practicing Kabbalah without revealing its secrets) that one removes Klippot, and it is by violence and negative behavior that one adds Klippot.|$|E
25|$|In The Horse and His Boy, Lewis {{uses the}} {{cultural}} settings of Narnia, Archenland, and Calormen {{to develop a}} theme of freedom in contrast to slavery. Lewis depicts the Calormene culture as one in which a primary guiding principle is that the weak must {{make way for the}} strong: For in Tashbaan there is only one traffic regulation, which <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> who is less important has {{to get out of the}} way for everyone who is more important; unless you want a cut from a whip or a punch from the butt end of a spear.|$|E
500|$|The film's most-quoted line of dialogue, {{spoken by}} Octave, is [...] "You see, in this world, {{there is one}} awful thing, and that <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> has his reasons." [...] Renoir's {{sentiment}} of objective humanism for the film's characters is articulated by Octave's remark and shows his empathy for the people he was simultaneously criticizing. Richard Roud praised Renoir's role in the film, observing that Renoir's honesty compelled him to include his own role in his social criticism: [...] "he {{did not wish to}} stand outside. And Renoir/Octave serves as the standard against which reality and fiction can be measured." [...] In his original outline for the film, Renoir said he intended all the characters to be sincere and that the film would have no villains.|$|E

500|$|The pop rock album {{opens with}} the curtain call, {{strengthening}} {{the impression of}} a live recording rather than a studio album. Carlile performed [...] "Shadow on the Wall", [...] "Turpentine", and [...] "The Story", which had appeared on Carlile's second studio album The Story (2007). [...] "Looking Out", [...] "Before It Breaks", [...] "I Will", [...] "Dreams", and [...] "Pride and Joy" [...] had all appeared on Give Up the Ghost. Believing in the cultivation of standards, Carlile included six cover versions in the set list, three of which appear on the album. [...] "Sixty Years On", originally written by Elton John and Bernie Taupin, was arranged by Paul Buckmaster. Carlile, a fan of the [...] "dark" [...] string arrangements that appear on John's album Tumbleweed Connection (1970), contacted Buckmaster on the advice of her manager. Carlile first heard the Hanseroth brothers singing Paul Simon's [...] "The Sound of Silence" [...] in 2009 and asked them to perform it during the set. She does not contribute vocals to the version that appears on the album. Carlile's cover of Leonard Cohen's [...] "Hallelujah", also arranged by Buckmaster, is followed by a hidden track: a cover of Alphaville's [...] "Forever Young". Carlile said the following of Cohen's song: [...] "Hallelujah" [...] {{is going to be a}} standard that our grandkids, our great-great grandkids will learn to sing in church. It's one of those really, really special songs. The thing that's going to make it that, besides that it's so great, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> knows about it because hundreds of songwriters have been moved by that song and have covered it.

Which many comment is not used in Brummie speech. Similarly Brummies pronounce 'I' as 'oy' whereas Black Country uses the dialect 'Ah' as in 'Ah bin' meaning I have been.|$|E

2500|$|Philo {{taught that}} Moses proclaimed the fast of Yom Kippur a feast and named it the {{greatest}} of feasts, [...] "a Sabbath of Sabbaths," [...] for many reasons. First is temperance, for when people {{have learned how to}} be indifferent to food and drink, they can easily disregard superfluous things. Second <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> thereby devotes their entire time to nothing else but prayers and supplications. And third is that the fast occurs at the conclusion of harvest time, to teach people not to rely solely on the food that they have accumulated as the cause of health or life, but on God, Who rules in the world and Who nourished our ancestors in the desert for 40 years.|$|E

[...] "What's most important <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> ... has an incredible time," [...] he says. [...] One of Carlson's favorite cooking techniques {{is to make}} ingredients that people normally would not tolerate into something palatable. [...] He is known to combine ingredients in bizarre ways, such as pairing oysters with oatmeal and raisins. Despite these wild dishes, Carlson is {{perhaps best known for}} his simplistic, modern interpretations of classic Italian dishes. His quail egg ravioli is considered his signature dish.

2500|$|Roger Ebert, {{film critic}} of the Chicago Sun-Times, praised Wonder Boys as [...] "the most {{accurate}} movie about campus life that I can remember. It is accurate, not because it captures intellectual debate or campus politics, but because it knows two things: (1) Students come and go, but the faculty actually lives there, and (2) many faculty members stay stuck in graduate-student mode for decades". Emanuel Levy of Variety wrote, [...] "The movie's frivolous touches and eccentric details emphasize its dry, measured wit {{and the power of}} comedy to underscore serious ideas. Massively inventive, Wonder Boys is spiked with fresh, perverse humor that flows naturally from the straight-faced playing". A.O. Scott from The New York Times wrote, [...] "The problem <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> involved seems to have agreed that it was a great idea for a movie and pretty much left it at that".|$|E

In the letter the resistance stated that [...] "We have received message from a trusted source in Western Norway who has been gathering reliable intelligence from eye witnesses and survivors about the sinking of Sanct Svithun. He declares that the German reports in the media are by and large correct. When the negative impacts have not been greater, the reason <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> back home refuse to believe that the English could have behaved in such a manner. This is in conflict with the experiences that people back home have made over almost three years. If anything like this was to happen again, it would be highly damaging."

And I hope that they don't have to serve 7 years in jail; {{that would be a}} tragedy. I think art should be political, that art, historically speaking, always reflects what's going on socially.

[...] Madonna later appeared on stage with a temporary tattoo that said [...] "Pussy Riot" [...] on her back in place of the usual [...] "No Fear" [...] slogan, and performed [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] donning a balaclava covering her face, the band's trademark. It was considered an artistic statement against the oppression of the band's freedom of speech.|$|E

[...] There, they are granted their every wish, including Howard's return to his true form, and Beverly never being tight again, and meet parodies of John Constantine, Wesley Dodds, The Endless, Spider Jerusalem, and Gerber's own Nevada (called Utah), all characters from DC Comics' Vertigo imprint. [...] The downside <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>everyone</b> staying in the place gets their every wish, so Che Guevara can have his revolution, but someone else can easily slaughter him.

[...] Upon leaving the house, Howard is once again transformed into a mouse. [...] Iprah has been merged with an experiment by the Angel Gabriel called Deuteronomy, intended to replace God, because God has been spending all his time in a bar in Hell since 1938. [...] Deuteronomy is a creature half id and half superego, while Iprah is an all-ego promoter of self-indulgent pop psychology. [...] Considering her dangerous, Gabriel sends the cherub Thrasher to resurrect Sigmund Freud, whose cigar blasts out half of Thrasher's brains (being immortal, this just makes him act drunk). [...] Iprah destroys Freud, but Howard blasts her with the cigar, separating her from Deuteronomy. [...] Puffing on the cigar, Howard disintegrates and arrives in Hell.

Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, however, wrote an expletive-ridden Twitter post lambasting Madonna for backing the band: [...] "With age, every ex-slut tends to lecture everybody on morality.

[...] Madonna's second Russian date in Saint Petersburg was consequently met with terrorist threats, prompting the U.S. Embassy to issue a warning to those in attendance. Madonna's spokesperson Liz Rosenberg responded that the concert would go on as scheduled and that Russian authorities would step up security for the date. Following threats of arrest by Russian officials if she spoke in support of gay rights and opposed the recent anti-gay law which prohibits [...] "public actions aimed at propaganda of sodomy, lesbianism, bisexuality, and transgenderism among minors", Madonna responded, on March 21, in a letter on her website saying she was a [...] "freedom fighter" [...] and would defend LGBT rights.
