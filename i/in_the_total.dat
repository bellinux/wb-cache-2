5|$|After the Reform Bill was {{rejected}} in the Lords, the House of Commons immediately passed a {{motion of confidence}} affirming their support for Lord Grey's administration. Because parliamentary rules prohibited {{the introduction of the}} same bill twice during the same session, the ministry advised the new king, William IV, to prorogue Parliament. As soon as the new session began in December 1831, the Third Reform Bill was brought forward. The bill was in a few respects different from its predecessors; it no longer proposed a reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> membership of the House of Commons, and it reflected data collected during the census that had just been completed. The new version passed in the House of Commons by even larger majorities in March 1832; it was once again sent up to the House of Lords.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, two new {{aircraft}} carriers were planned. The {{requirements for the}} intended force of four carriers meant that five squadrons of Phantoms would be needed. However, in its 1966 Defence White Paper, the Government decided to cancel the two new carriers, which led to reductions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> order for the Royal Navy's Phantoms. Initially 143 were ordered, which was cut to 110, and finally just 50, with options for another seven. The intention was to form a pair of front-line squadrons, each of twelve aircraft, that would operate from the two remaining, heavily modernised fleet carriers. The rest of the aircraft would be a reserve and for training.|$|E

Two Ju 88G-1s of II./NJG 101 lead as pathfinders. Some of I./JG 4 attacked No. 125 Wing RAF Spitfires at Ophoven airfield. Spitfire losses are unclear. Two P-47s and a B-17 were destroyed. I./JG 4 reported two Bf 109s missing, one damaged and one destroyed. Just a hangar, one P-47 and several vehicles were claimed, and the anti-aircraft battery was silenced. The attack on the Spitfires at Ophoven and the mentioned B-17 and two P-47s are not included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>total.</b> Another source suggests two Spitfires destroyed and 10 damaged at Ophoven.|$|E
5|$|Lemur {{taxonomy}} is controversial, {{and not all}} experts agree, {{particularly with}} the recent {{increase in the number}} of recognized species. According to Russell Mittermeier, the president of Conservation International (CI), taxonomist Colin Groves, and others, there are nearly 100recognized species or subspecies of extant (or living) lemur, divided into five families and 15genera. Because genetic data indicates that the recently extinct subfossil lemurs were closely related to living lemurs, an additional three families, eight genera, and 17species can be included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>total.</b> In contrast, other experts have labeled this as taxonomic inflation, instead preferring a total closer to 50 species.|$|E

5|$|Narrowing of the airways occurs due to {{inflammation}} and scarring within them. This {{contributes to the}} inability to breathe out fully. The greatest reduction in air flow occurs when breathing out, as the pressure in the chest is compressing the airways at this time. This can result in more air from the previous breath remaining within the lungs when the next breath is started, resulting in an increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> volume of air in the lungs at any given time, a process called hyperinflation or air trapping. Hyperinflation from exercise is linked to shortness of breath in COPD, as it is less comfortable to breathe in when the lungs are already partly full. Hyperinflation may also worsen during an exacerbation.|$|E
5|$|The {{company was}} placed in {{administration}} in March 2001, following two years of heavy losses, and closed down permanently a month later. This led {{to a series of}} service changes, which saw its operations covered by a range of different operators. Other effects causing Tillingbourne's collapse included a fall <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>total</b> number of passengers using buses in Hampshire and local criticism following {{an increase in the number}} of vehicles using the, later closed, Arriva West Sussex garage in Warnham. The sites of both Tillingbourne garages in Cranleigh were converted for use by other industries.|$|E

He was the first male skater since Terry Kubicka to win {{back-to-back}} Novice and Junior Men's titles in the United States. The win on the junior level was unusual in that Lysacek moved from third to first overall while sitting backstage, because he won through a tiebreak in the 6.0 ordinal system. Lysacek was tied with Parker Pennington in second place ordinals and had one more first place ordinal, giving him the win in the free skate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Total</b> Ordinals of Majority tiebreaker, which pushed him ahead in overall factored placements, allowing him to win the title overall.
