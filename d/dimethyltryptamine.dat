5|$|Psilocybin is a {{tryptamine}} compound with {{a chemical}} structure containing an indole ring {{linked to an}} ethylamine substituent. It is chemically related to the amino acid tryptophan, and is structurally similar to the neurotransmitter serotonin. Psilocybin {{is a member of}} the general class of tryptophan-based compounds that originally functioned as antioxidants in earlier life forms before assuming more complex functions in multicellular organisms, including humans. Other related indole-containing psychedelic compounds include <b>dimethyltryptamine,</b> found in many plant species and in trace amounts in some mammals, and bufotenine, found in the skin of psychoactive toads.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} psychoactive {{drugs and alcohol}} have notable effects on consciousness. These range from a simple dulling of {{awareness}} produced by sedatives, to increases in the intensity of sensory qualities produced by stimulants, cannabis, empathogens–entactogens such as MDMA ("Ecstasy"), or most notably by the class of drugs known as psychedelics. LSD, mescaline, psilocybin, <b>Dimethyltryptamine,</b> and others in this group can produce major distortions of perception, including hallucinations; some users even describe their drug-induced experiences as mystical or spiritual in quality. The brain mechanisms underlying these effects are not as well understood as those induced by use of alcohol, but there is substantial evidence that alterations in the brain system that uses the chemical neurotransmitter serotonin play an essential role.|$|E
25|$|Indole {{undergoes}} electrophilic substitution, mainly {{at position}} 3 (see diagram in right margin). Substituted indoles are structural elements of (and for some compounds, the synthetic precursors for) the tryptophan-derived tryptamine alkaloids like the neurotransmitter serotonin, and melatonin. Other indolic compounds include the plant hormone auxin (indolyl-3-acetic acid, IAA), tryptophol, the anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin, the betablocker pindolol, and the naturally occurring hallucinogen <b>dimethyltryptamine.</b>|$|E
40|$|The orphan {{receptor}} sigma- 1 (sigmar- 1) is a transmembrane chaperone protein expressed {{in both the}} central nervous system and in immune cells. It has been shown to regulate neuronal differentiation and cell survival, and mediates anti-inflammatory responses and immunosuppression in murine in vivo models. Since the details of these findings have not been elucidated so far, we studied the effects of the endogenous sigmar- 1 ligands N,N-dimethyltryptamine (NN-DMT), its derivative 5 -methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5 -MeO-DMT) and the synthetic high affinity sigmar- 1 agonist PRE- 084 hydrochloride on human primary monocyte-derived dendritic cell (moDCs) activation provoked by LPS, polyI:C or pathogen-derived stimuli to induce inflammatory responses. Co-treatment of moDC with these activators and sigma- 1 receptor ligands inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL- 1 β, IL- 6, TNFα and the chemokine IL- 8, while increased the secretion of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL- 10. The T-cell activating capacity of moDCs was also inhibited, and <b>dimethyltryptamines</b> used in combination with E. coli or influenza virus as stimulators decreased the differentiation of moDC-induced Th 1 and Th 17 inflammatory effector T-cells in a sigmar- 1 specific manner as confirmed by gene silencing. Here we demonstrate {{for the first time the}} immunomodulatory potential of NN-DMT and 5 -MeO-DMT on human moDC functions via sigmar- 1 that could be harnessed for the pharmacological treatment of autoimmune diseases and chronic inflammatory conditions of the CNS or peripheral tissues. Our findings also point out a new biological role for <b>dimethyltryptamines,</b> which may act as systemic endogenous regulators of inflammation and immune homeostasis through the sigma- 1 receptor...|$|R
40|$|<b>Dimethyltryptamines</b> are entheogenic serotonin-like {{molecules}} {{present in}} traditional Amerindian medicine recently associated with cognitive gains, antidepressant effects, {{and changes in}} brain areas related to attention. Legal restrictions {{and the lack of}} adequate experimental models have limited the understanding of how such substances impact human brain metabolism. Here we used shotgun mass spectrometry to explore proteomic differences induced by 5 -methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5 -MeO-DMT) on human cerebral organoids. Out of the 6, 728 identified proteins, 934 were found differentially expressed in 5 -MeO-DMT-treated cerebral organoids. In silico analysis reinforced previously reported anti-inflammatory actions of 5 -MeO-DMT and revealed modulatory effects on proteins associated with long-term potentiation, the formation of dendritic spines, including those involved in cellular protrusion formation, microtubule dynamics, and cytoskeletal reorganization. Our data offer the first insight about molecular alterations caused by 5 -MeO-DMT in human cerebral organoids...|$|R
25|$|In Theosophy it {{is related}} to the pineal gland. According to this belief, humans had in far ancient times an actual third eye {{in the back of the}} head with a {{physical}} and spiritual function. Over time, as humans evolved, this eye atrophied and sunk into what today is known as the pineal gland. Dr. Rick Strassman has hypothesized that the pineal gland, which maintains light sensitivity, is responsible for the production and release of DMT (<b>dimethyltryptamine),</b> an entheogen which he believes possibly could be excreted in large quantities at the moments of birth and death.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dimethyltryptamine</b> is an indole {{alkaloid}} {{derived from}} the shikimate pathway. Its biosynthesis is relatively simple and summarized in the adjacent picture. In plants, the parent amino acid L-tryptophan is produced endogenously where in animals L-tryptophan is an essential amino acid coming from diet. No matter the source of L-tryptophan, the biosynthesis begins with its decarboxylation by an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) enzyme (step 1). The resulting decarboxylated tryptophan analog is tryptamine. Tryptamine then undergoes a transmethylation (step 2): the enzyme indolethylamine-N-methyltransferase (INMT) catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from cofactor S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM), via nucleophilic attack, to tryptamine. This reaction transforms SAM into S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), and gives the intermediate product N-methyltryptamine (NMT). NMT is in turn transmethylated by the same process (step 3) to form the end product N,N-dimethyltryptamine. Tryptamine transmethylation is regulated by two products of the reaction: SAH, and DMT were shown ex vivo {{to be among the}} most potent inhibitors of rabbit INMT activity.|$|E
2500|$|Traditional {{ayahuasca}} brews {{are usually}} made with Banisteriopsis caapi as an MAOI, although <b>dimethyltryptamine</b> sources and other admixtures vary from region to region. [...] There are several varieties of caapi, often known as different [...] "colors", with varying effects, potencies, and uses.|$|E
2500|$|Another legal {{dilemma is}} the {{creation}} in several countries of a legal loopholes allowing for arbitrary arrest and prosecution. This {{is the result of}} several drugs such as <b>Dimethyltryptamine,</b> GHB, and morphine being illegal to possess but also inherently present in all humans as a result of endogenous synthesis. Since some jurisdictions classify possession of drugs to include having the drug present in the blood in any concentration, all residents of such countries are technically in possession of multiple illegal drugs at all times.|$|E
2500|$|Research and {{therapeutic}} sessions have nevertheless {{continued to be}} performed, {{in one way or}} another, to the present day. Some therapists have exploited windows of opportunity preceding scheduling of particular substances (e.g. [...] LSD, <b>Dimethyltryptamine,</b> Psilocybin, 2C-B, Mescaline, MDMA, Cannabis, Ketamine, Ibogaine, Harmaline, Ayahuasca, [...] Salvia divinorum) or developed extensive non-drug techniques for achieving similar states of consciousness (e.g. Holotropic Breathwork). For the most part, however, since the early 1970s, psychedelic therapy has been conducted by an underground network of people willing to conduct therapy sessions using psychedelic substances. Board-certified therapists, in doing this, risked losing both their career and their liberty. In recent years, some researchers, including Charles Grob and Michael Mithoefer, have carried out human studies of psychedelics as possible treatments for various ailments.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the partial}} {{completion}} of his studies, and his mother's death from cancer in 1971, McKenna, his brother Dennis, and three friends {{traveled to the}} Colombian Amazon in search of oo-koo-hé, a plant preparation containing <b>dimethyltryptamine</b> (DMT). [...] Instead of oo-koo-hé they found fields full of gigantic Psilocybe cubensis mushrooms, which became the new focus of the expedition. In La Chorrera, {{at the urging of}} his brother, McKenna {{was the subject of a}} psychedelic experiment in which the brothers attempted to bond harmine (harmine is another psychedelic compound they used synergistically with the mushrooms) with their own neural DNA, through the use of a set specific vocal techniques. They hypothesised this would give them access to the collective memory of the human species, and would manifest the alchemists’ Philosopher’s Stone which they viewed as a [...] "hyperdimensional union of spirit and matter". McKenna claimed the experiment put him in contact with [...] "Logos": an informative, divine voice he believed was universal to visionary religious experience. The voice's reputed revelations and his brother's simultaneous peculiar psychedelic experience prompted him to explore the structure of an early form of the I Ching, which led to his [...] "Novelty Theory".|$|E
