5|$|Like most flight {{instructors}} giving dual instruction, Reid {{was seated}} on the right side, while the aircraft's primary flight instruments were mounted on the left, in front of Dubroff in this case. Investigators speculated {{that because of the}} heavy rain in his immediate climb path, Reid's <b>forward</b> <b>visibility</b> became greatly restricted. To maintain control through the climbing right turn, {{he would have had to}} turn his head to the left to see the flight instruments (most critically the attitude and airspeed indicators) and to the right to see the ground through the side window. Such side-to-side head motion, combined with the worsening flight visibility during the climb and the reduced stall margin, could have led to spatial disorientation and loss of control.|$|E
5|$|The main design {{differences}} with the Nclass included the cab front, exhaust arrangements, {{and the addition of}} an extra (inside) cylinder between the frames to drive the centre driving axle. Clayton had revised the layout of the cab front spectacle plates (small windows {{on the front of the}} cab) to improve <b>forward</b> <b>visibility.</b> This incorporated two large single panes of glass either side of the boiler instead of the four smaller windows used on the Nclass. The inside cylinder was to be actuated by Holcroft's design of conjugated valve gear, which consisted of mechanical links fitted to both sets of outside Walschaerts gear, eliminating the need for a separate set of valve gear between the frames to operate the inside cylinder. The result would be a reduction in weight and the amount of mechanical equipment located in this inaccessible part of the locomotive.|$|E
50|$|Latest {{generation}} transmissometer technology {{makes use}} of a co-located <b>forward</b> scatter <b>visibility</b> sensor on the transmitter unit to allow for higher accuracies over an Extended Meteorological Optical Range or EMOR. After 10,000 meters the accuracy of transmissometer technology diminishes, and at higher <b>visibilities</b> <b>forward</b> scatter <b>visibility</b> sensor technology is more accurate. The co-location of the two sensors allows for the most accurate technology to be used when reporting current <b>visibility.</b> The <b>forward</b> scatter sensor also enables auto-alignment and auto-calibration of the transmissometer device.Hence it is very useful for oceanography and water optics study.|$|R
50|$|Ordered in late 1944 as the XFJ-1 in {{competition}} with proposals from Douglas and Vought, the Fury began as a straight-wing, tricycle gear fighter with a single turbojet passing through the fuselage. The wing, empennage and canopy strongly resembled that of the piston-engined P-51D Mustang, North American Aviation's highly successful World War II fighter, enclosing a relocated cockpit accommodation further forward {{in relation to the}} Mustang's design, to ensure good <b>forward</b> pilot <b>visibility</b> for carrier operations.|$|R

5000|$|The Phenix is {{constructed}} mostly from carbon fibre and of pod and boom layout. It features a single, two-bladed Wagtail or 8.40 m diameter Averso main rotor with a chord of 21.4 cm mounted {{at the top}} of a tall column. It has a two-seats-in side-by-side configuration enclosed cockpit with forward hinged doors on both sides, tricycle landing gear and a four-cylinder, air and liquid-cooled, four-stroke, dual-ignition turbocharged [...] Rotax 914 engine in tractor configuration. The tractor layout provides better propeller efficiency and less noise, but at the cost of reduced <b>forward</b> cockpit <b>visibility.</b> Behind the seats is a separate baggage space, accessed externally from either side through its own doors.|$|R
40|$|A {{new concept}} for {{dispersing}} warm fog is presented. This brute force technique uses large volume recycled water sprays. Energy requirements for this technique are {{an order of}} magnitude less than those to operate a thermo-kinetic system. An important side benefit is the considerable emergency fire extinguishing capability it provides along the runway. Tests conducted to provide drop spectra measurements and temperature response measurements of suitable water sprays are described. Three mobile firefighting modules capable of spraying up to 630 l/s (10, 000 gpm) to a height in excess of 50 m were utilized. Periodic operation of two parallel rows of nozzles in a heavy fog resulted in downwind-correlated increases in the visual range measured with a <b>forward</b> scatter <b>visibility</b> meter...|$|R

We use a database collected on a weather observation site equipped with both a <b>forward</b> scatter <b>visibility</b> meter and a CCTV camera. We implement a computer vision method based on the contrast sensitivity function of the human visual system to estimate the visibility level (VL) of targets located at different distances in the scene, and we study {{the relationship of the}} results with the extinction coefficient of the atmosphere, derived from the meteorological optical range (MOR) provided by the optical sensor. We show that Koschmieder’s law, which predicts exponential reduction of visibility as a function of optical depth, applies not only to dark objects against the sky, but to other types of contrast as well...|$|R

25|$|The chimney {{was really}} a pair of {{concentric}} ones. It is usually considered to have been adopted to aid <b>forward</b> <b>visibility</b> for the driver (a rather different pattern of smoke deflector), {{but there is some}} evidence that the real reason was to reduce the chance of lineside fires (rather like the prominent 'stacks' of early United States designs).|$|E
25|$|The {{length of}} side tanks was often limited {{in order to}} give access to the inside motion. If it was desired to extend them {{to the front of the}} {{locomotive}} for greater capacity, access could be facilitated by apertures provided at the appropriate location. With larger side tanks it was sometimes necessary to taper the tanks slightly at the front end to improve <b>forward</b> <b>visibility.</b> Side tanks almost all stopped at, or before, the end of the boiler barrel, with the smokebox protruding ahead. A few designs did reach to the front of the smokebox and these were termed 'flatirons'.|$|E
50|$|The Great Northern Railway Class J23 was a {{class of}} 0-6-0T steam locomotive. They had long side tanks that came {{to the front of}} the smokebox, which sloped <b>forwards</b> to improve <b>visibility</b> and had a recess cut in to aid maintenance. Forty were built by the Great Northern Railway (GNR) between 1913 and 1922, with a further 62 being added by the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) between 1924 and 1939. There are plans to build a new J50/2 as of April 2013.|$|R
50|$|The Ba.27 was a low-wing braced {{monoplane}} with fixed tailwheel undercarriage. As originally designed, the Ba.27 had a fuselage {{of steel}} tube construction, skinned with light corrugated alloy metal, and wooden wings and tailplane. Evaluation {{of the two}} prototypes by the Regia Aeronautica in 1933 was strongly negative, resulting in an extensive redesign of the aircraft. The fuselage shape was made more rounded and the pilot's open cockpit was moved higher and <b>forward</b> to improve <b>visibility.</b> The corrugated skinning was also replaced with smooth sheet metal.|$|R
50|$|The ancestral {{species of}} {{tetrapods}} that lived entirely in water had {{tall and narrow}} skulls with eyes facing sideways and <b>forwards</b> to maximize <b>visibility</b> for predators and prey in the aquatic environment. As the ancestors of early tetrapods started inhabiting shallower waters, these species had flatter skulls with eyes at the tops of their heads, which {{made it possible to}} spot food above them. Once the tetrapods transitioned onto land, the lineages evolved to have tall and narrow skulls with eyes facing sideways and forwards again. This allowed them to navigate through the terrestrial environment and look for predators and prey.|$|R
25|$|On 11 July, Bader scored {{his first}} victory {{with his new}} squadron. The cloud base was down to just 600ft while drizzle and mist covered most of the sky, and <b>forward</b> <b>visibility</b> was down to just 2,000 yards. Bader was alone on patrol, and was soon {{directed}} toward an enemy aircraft flying north up the Norfolk coast. Spotting the aircraft at 600 yards, Bader recognised it as a Dornier Do 17, and after he closed to 250 yards its rear gunner opened fire. Bader continued his attack and fired two bursts into the bomber before it vanished into cloud. The Dornier, which crashed into the sea off Cromer, was later confirmed {{by a member of}} the Royal Observer Corps. On 21 August, a similar engagement took place. This time, a Dornier went into the sea off Great Yarmouth and again the Observer Corps confirmed the claim. There were no survivors.|$|E
25|$|The XFT-1 first flew on January 16, 1934, being {{delivered}} to NAS Anacostia for evaluation by the Navy. While it was the fastest fighter yet tested by the U.S. Navy, its handling characteristics were poor. Although it was fitted with flaps to lower its landing speed, {{it was difficult to}} control at low speeds, and had poor <b>forward</b> <b>visibility,</b> major problems for an aircraft intended to operate off aircraft carriers. Its most serious problem, however, was its behavior when spinning, where the tail was subject to severe buffeting. In February 1934, test pilot Vance Breese landed the prototype XFT-1 without authorization at Glendale California at a Curtiss Wright Technical Institute location, and pictures of the XFT-1 were leaked to Janes AWA. It was fitted with a more powerful R-1510 engine in August 1934, but this did not improve performance, and it was returned to Northrop for more major modifications, being fitted with larger tail surfaces and a Pratt & Whitney R-1535 Twin Wasp Junior radial engine, being redesignated XFT-2.|$|E
25|$|At Lindbergh's request, {{the large}} main and forward fuel tanks {{were placed in}} the forward section of the fuselage, in front of the pilot, with the oil tank acting as a firewall. This {{arrangement}} improved the center of gravity and reduced the risk of the pilot being crushed to death between the main tank and the engine {{in the event of a}} crash. This design decision meant that there could be no front windshield, and that <b>forward</b> <b>visibility</b> would be limited to the side windows. This did not concern Lindbergh as he was used to flying in the rear cockpit of mail planes with mail bags in the front. When he wanted to see forward, he would slightly yaw the aircraft and look out the side. To provide some forward vision as a precaution against hitting ship masts, trees, or structures while flying at low altitude, a Ryan employee who had served in the submarine service installed a periscope which Lindbergh helped design. It is unclear whether the periscope was used during the flight. The instrument panel housed fuel pressure, oil pressure and temperature gauges, a clock, altimeter, tachometer, airspeed indicator, bank and turn indicator, and a liquid magnetic compass. The main compass was mounted behind Lindbergh in the cockpit, and he read it using the mirror from a women's makeup case which was mounted to the ceiling using chewing gum. Lindbergh also installed a newly developed Earth Inductor Compass made by the Pioneer Instrument Company which allowed him to more accurately navigate while taking account of the magnetic declination of the earth. Lindbergh's ultimate arrival in Ireland deviated from his flight plan by just a few miles.|$|E
40|$|The newly {{developed}} X-ray <b>visibility</b> <b>forward</b> fitting technique {{is applied to}} Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) data of a limb flare to investigate the energy and height dependence on sizes, shapes, and position of hard X-ray chromospheric footpoint sources. This provides information about the electron transport and chromospheric density structure. The spatial distribution of two footpoint X-ray sources is analyzed using PIXON, Maximum Entropy Method, CLEAN and <b>visibility</b> <b>forward</b> fit algorithms at nonthermal energies from ∼ 20 to ∼ 200 keV. We report, for the first time, the vertical extents and widths of hard X-ray chromospheric sources measured {{as a function of}} energy for a limb event. Our observations suggest that both the vertical and horizontal sizes of footpoints are decreasing with energy. Higher energy emission originates progressively deeper in the chromosphere consistent with downward flare accelerated streaming electrons. The ellipticity of the footpoints grows with energy from ∼ 0. 5 at ∼ 20 keV to ∼ 0. 9 at ∼ 150 keV. The positions of X-ray emission are in agreement with an exponential density profile of scale height ∼ 150 km. The characteristic size of the hard X-ray footpoint source along the limb is decreasing with energy suggesting a converging magnetic field in the footpoint. The vertical sizes of X-ray sources are inconsistent with simple collisional transport in a single density scale height but can be explained using a multi-threaded density structure in the chromosphere.

5000|$|The {{difficulties}} faced {{were not}} confined to the numbers of guns and the quantity of ammunition. The flat terrain, with dense jungle or open strips of tall grass, provided no vantage point from which to observe and adjust fire. Maps available for plotting targets were inaccurate and lacked detail. A workable map was constructed from air photos. Sound ranging was used in place of observation. By [...] "skilful calculation", fire could be delivered to an accuracy of 200 yds m. However, well-trained infantry would look to advance as near as 30 yds m to the fall of the shot. To improve <b>visibility,</b> <b>forward</b> observers would take to the trees, making them targets for Japanese snipers.|$|R
50|$|The front section, an {{open area}} between the tracks, was flanked by tall narrow structures, above {{the front of the}} track frame at each side, that acted as {{armoured}} cabs for driver on the left and brakesman to the right. In the prototype these driving positions had been {{directly in front of the}} superstructure; moving them <b>forward</b> greatly improved <b>visibility,</b> but made communication very difficult. This arrangement had obvious disadvantages where, as in the Mark I, four men, including the gearsmen, had to coordinate their actions to drive and manoeuvre a most ungainly vehicle. Between these two structures lay a low-slung pivoting platform able to accommodate a 60-pounder (5-inch) gun, a 6-inch 26 cwt howitzer or any equivalent in stores or personnel.|$|R
500|$|As {{with the}} Merchant Navy class, they were {{fitted with a}} new design of cab front {{spectacle}} plates from mid1947 due to poor <b>forward</b> <b>visibility.</b> The small windows on the front face of the cab were redesigned to an angled profile, giving improved visibility to the driver. This was a feature fitted to all Bulleid-designed locomotives post-nationalisation. They were introduced in Britain in 1934 with the Gresley-designed Cock o' the North. Over the next decade the revised design was fitted to existing members of the class. Another modification was the reduction of boiler pressure to [...] to reduce maintenance costs.|$|E
500|$|The Kclass design used a [...] "Bissel bogie" [...] {{leading axle}} and a plain {{trailing}} bogie. The trailing bogie permitted {{the use of}} a large coal bunker that was capable of sustaining the locomotive over the run between London Charing Cross and , and side water tanks of [...] capacity were used, negating the need for a tender. The coupled wheelbase between the rear and centre driving wheels was reduced from that used on the mechanically identical Nclass to [...] to accommodate the bogie. The cab was fully enclosed, although the set of four small front spectacle plates (the windows on the front face of the cab for <b>forward</b> <b>visibility)</b> were the same as those used on the Nclass.|$|E
500|$|The basic {{layout of}} the class was {{influenced}} by the existing ‘’Lord Nelson’’ class 4-6-0 design, but the use of the round topped firebox enabled Maunsell to design the cab's curved profile to fit the gauge restrictions of the Hastings line while allowing adequate <b>forward</b> <b>visibility.</b> The short frame length of the 4-4-0 locomotive also meant very little overhang on the line's tight curves. To maintain the high power rating required for express passenger engines, Maunsell opted for a three-cylinder design. In terms of tractive effort, the class was the most powerful 4-4-0 ever built in Britain, and were the only 4-4-0 type to be given the power classification of 5P by British Railways. They were well liked by crews. They also had a higher tractive effort than the nominally more powerful King Arthur class 4-6-0s, but at the cost of high axle-loading: [...] The permanent way on the Hastings line therefore had to be upgraded during 1929 and 1930 to accept the new locomotive.|$|E
50|$|The last {{flotilla}} {{of eight}} ships and two ships of an expanded design were ordered under the 1944 estimates. The first eight ships {{were to be}} fitted with two twin 4.5-inch guns forward in the new RP41 Mk VI turrets. These turrets offered improved ammunition handling and a faster rate of fire due to their semi-automatic breech action and {{it was thought that}} this was sufficient to preclude the fitting of the single gun amidships. The bridge structure was raised as earlier trials in Saintes had noted that the higher profile of the Mk VI turret obstructed <b>visibility</b> <b>forward.</b> The AA armament was increased in these ships as the weight saved by dispensing with the single 4.5-inch gun amidships meant that a third twin STAAG could be fitted together with five single 40/60 mm guns giving a total of eleven light AA guns.|$|R
40|$|In mid- 1991 NASA {{contracted}} with industry {{to study the}} high-speed civil transport (HSCT) flight deck challenges and assess the benefits, prior to initiating their High Speed Research Program (HSRP) Phase 2 efforts, then scheduled for FY- 93. The results of this nine-month effort are presented, {{and a number of}} the most significant findings for the specified advanced concepts are highlighted: (1) a no nose-droop configuration; (2) a far forward cockpit location; and (3) advanced crew monitoring and control of complex systems. The results indicate that the no nose-droop configuration is critically dependent upon the design and development of a safe, reliable, and certifiable Synthetic Vision System (SVS). The droop-nose configuration would cause significant weight, performance, and cost penalties. The far forward cockpit location, with the conventional side-by-side seating provides little economic advantage; however, a configuration with a tandem seating arrangement provides a substantial increase in either additional payload (i. e., passengers) or potential downsizing of the vehicle with resulting increases in performance efficiencies and associated reductions in emissions. Without a droop nose, <b>forward</b> external <b>visibility</b> is negated and takeoff/landing guidance and control must rely {{on the use of the}} SVS. The technologies enabling such capabilities, which de facto provides for Category 3 all-weather operations on every flight independent of weather, represent a dramatic benefits multiplier in a 2005 global ATM network: both in terms of enhanced economic viability and environmental acceptability...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe aerosol extinction-to-backscatter {{ratio is}} an {{important}} parameter for inverting LIDAR signals in the LIDAR equation. It is a complicated function of the aerosol microphysical characteristics. In this paper, a method to retrieve the column-averaged aerosol extinction-to-backscatter ratio by constraining the aerosol optical depths (AOD) from a Micro-pulse LIDAR (MPL) by the AOD measurements from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is presented. Both measurements were taken on cloud free days between 1 May 2003 and 30 June 2004 over Hong Kong, a coastal city in south China. Simultaneous measurements of aerosol scattering coefficients with a <b>forward</b> scattering <b>visibility</b> sensor are compared with the LIDAR retrieval of aerosol extinction coefficients. The data are then analyzed to determine seasonal trends of the aetrosol extinction-to-backscatter ratio. In addition, {{the relationships between the}} extinction-to-backscatter ratio and wind conditions as well as other aerosol microphysical parameters are presented. The mean aerosol extinction-to-backscatter ratio for the whole period was found to be 29. 1 ± 5. 8 sr, with a minimum of 18 sr in July 2003 and a maximum of 44 sr in March 2004. The ratio is lower in summer because of the dominance of oceanic aerosols in association with the prevailing southwesterly monsoon. In contrast, relatively larger ratios are noted in spring and winter because of the increased impact of local and regional industrial pollutants associated with the northerly monsoon. The extended LIDAR measurements over Hong Kong provide not only a more accurate retrieval of aerosol extinction coefficient profiles, but also significant substantial information for air pollution and climate studies in the region...|$|R
500|$|Development of the second-generation LS 400 {{began after}} {{worldwide}} {{launch of the}} first generation under program code 250T. Given the first-generation model's successful reception and high level of customer satisfaction with its design, replicating the original LS 400's attributes with its successor was one of chief engineer Kazuo Okamoto's primary goals (he stated that [...] "a tradition cannot be founded if you reject the first generation"). Externally, the most significant change was an increase in wheelbase length of , resulting in more interior space and an additional [...] of rear-seat legroom. However, as the overall length remained the same, trunk capacity was slightly reduced. The more aerodynamic body (C'd 0.28) retained the general profile and contours of the original LS 400 and was the work of the Calty Design Research center in the U.S. Designers had evaluated 20 competing concepts, including several with a radically changed body, before selecting a winning entry in 1991 that included forms and contours similar to the original LS 400. Upon final approval in 1992, an evolutionary redesign was the ultimate result, with new design features consisting of sharper angles, curved body lines, and a beveled grille. More prominent side lines provided a reference point for parking maneuvers, and <b>forward</b> <b>visibility</b> was improved.

Results: Our observations suggest that {{the density of the}} neutral gas is in good agreement with hydrostatic models with a scale height of around 140 30 km. FWHM sizes of the X-ray sources decrease with energy suggesting the expansion (fanning out) of magnetic flux tubes in the chromosphere with height.
