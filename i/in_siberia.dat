5|$|Soviet rail {{transport}} became, after the Great Patriotic War, {{one of the}} most developed in the world, surpassing most of its First World counterparts. The Soviet railway system was growing in size, at a rate of 639km a year from 1965 to 1980, while the growth of {{rail transport}} in First World countries was either decreasing or stagnating. This steady growth in rail transport {{can be explained by the}} country's need to extract its natural resources, most of which were located close to, or <b>in</b> <b>Siberia.</b> While some problems with the railways had been reported by the Soviet press, the Soviet Union could boast of controlling {{one of the most}} electrified railway systems at the time. During much of the country's later lifespan, trains usually carried coal, oil, construction material (mostly stone, cement and sand) and timber. Oil and oil products were one of the key reasons for building railway infrastructure <b>in</b> <b>Siberia</b> in the first place.|$|E
5|$|The Russian system {{differed}} from the British and American systems in its relationship with indigenous peoples. Using the same method they had used <b>in</b> <b>Siberia,</b> the Russians employed or enserfed Aleut and Alutiiq people, the latter being a subgroup of the Yupik Eskimo people. The Aleut and Alutiiq people were expert sea otter hunters, noted for their use of kayaks and baidarkas. Russian ships were mainly used for transporting and assisting native hunting parties. This {{differed from}} the British and American system, where the natives hunted sea otters and prepared the furs on their own, and were essentially independent agents of the fur trade. The Russians did not trade freely with the native Alaskans; rather, they imposed a fur tribute known as yasak. The yasak system, which was widely used <b>in</b> <b>Siberia,</b> essentially enslaved the natives. In 1788, it was banned in Russian America, only {{to be replaced by}} compulsory labor.|$|E

5|$|Russian {{maritime}} fur {{trading in}} the northern Pacific began after the exploration voyages of Vitus Bering and Aleksei Chirikov in 1741 and 1742. Their voyages demonstrated that Asia and North America were not connected but that sea voyages were feasible, and that the region was rich in furs. Private fur traders, mostly promyshlenniki, launched fur trading expeditions from Kamchatka, at first focusing on nearby islands such as the Commander Islands. Unlike fur trading ventures <b>in</b> <b>Siberia,</b> these maritime expeditions required more capital than most promyshlenniki could obtain. Merchants from cities such as Irkutsk, Tobolsk, and others in European Russia, became the principal investors.|$|E
