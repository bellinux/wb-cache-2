5|$|When Kukunoor was {{thinking}} of a character full of disguises, he first {{came up with an}} old man. When the thought of a scene with the three major characters dancing in the dunes came up, he realized that an older character could not realistically dance in the desert. He immediately felt that Shreyas Talpade, whom he knew of knowing mimicry, could be used for bahuroopiya. Kukunoor, who worked previously with Girish Karnad, said that he was the strength for the film and added that he found him a <b>good</b> <b>actor</b> and a good human being.|$|E

Milhouse wants the male lead role of Rick because of his love for Lisa, but he is challenged by a new boy, Jack Deforest, who dresses, acts and speaks like Humphrey Bogart. Milhouse enlists the bullies to beat up Jack, but Jack wins the fight. Principal Skinner sees this violence and declares that Milhouse will play Rick instead of Jack; Lisa is angered as she {{does not believe that}} he is a <b>good</b> <b>actor.</b> Marge tells Lisa {{that it is important to}} encourage people who are not skilled by telling them that they are, using the example of Homer. The production is a success, but at the end it is revealed that Jack was disguised as Milhouse; he and Lisa leave hand-in-hand.|$|E
5|$|Theophilus {{first tried}} to work with Highmore and asked to run the {{operations}} of the theatre. However, he was turned down, which provoked him to stir the actors into a rebellion. Many of the actors were upset about the management changes and theatre's operations. Highmore did not have experience in theatre, refused to listen to actors' ideas, and cut their salaries in half. Theophilus was known as a successful manager and a <b>good</b> <b>actor.</b> The rebellious actors' plan was to take over the lease and then deny the use of the building to the shareholders, who did not own the complex that they set their stage in. The actors would then use their control over the building to negotiate renting of the patent so they could control how the theatre was run.|$|E

25|$|Mickey Curtis said, {{also in a}} Criterion Collection interview, that he did {{not think}} he was a <b>good</b> <b>actor,</b> but Ichikawa said he just needed to act naturally. Ichikawa had heard that Curtis was very thin, so he decided to use him, as the {{characters}} in the story have eaten very little. Ichikawa specifically told each actor how he wanted them to react, and would not rehearse. Ichikawa expressed that the narrator (Tamura) could not be a cannibal because then he would have crossed the ultimate low. Ichikawa consulted with his wife, Natto Wada, and they decided against having him eat human flesh. As a result, Tamura never eats any in the film because his teeth are falling out.|$|E
25|$|Her last serious {{love affair}} {{was with the}} Dutch-born actor Lou Tellegen, 37 years her junior, who became her co-star during her second American {{farewell}} tour (and eighth American tour) in 1910. He was a very handsome actor who {{had served as a}} model for sculpture Eternal Springtime by Rodin. He had little acting experience, but Bernhardt signed him as a leading man just before she departed on the tour, assigned him a compartment in her private railway car, and took him as her escort to all events, functions, and parties. He was not a particularly <b>good</b> <b>actor,</b> and had a strong Dutch accent, but he was successful in roles, such as Hippolyte in Phedre, where he could take off his shirt. At the end of the American tour they had a dispute and he remained in the United States while she returned to France. At first, he had a successful career in the United States, and married film actress Geraldine Farrar, but when they split up his career plummeted. He committed suicide in 1934.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the injury}} to her leg, she {{continued}} to go on tour every summer, when her own theater in Paris was closed. In June 1908, she made a 20-day tour of Britain and Ireland, performing in 16 different cities. In 1908–1909, she toured Russia and Poland. Her second American farewell tour (her eighth tour in America) began in late 1910. She took along a new leading man, the Dutch-born Lou Tellegen, a very handsome actor who {{had served as a}} model for the sculpture Eternal Springtime by Auguste Rodin, and who became her co-star for the next two years, as well as her escort to all events, functions, and parties. He was not a particularly <b>good</b> <b>actor,</b> and had a strong Dutch accent, but he was successful in roles such as Hippolyte in Phedre, where he could take off his shirt and show off his physique. In New York, she created yet another scandal when she appeared in the role of Judas Iscariot in Judas by the American playwright John Wesley De Kay. It was performed in New York's Globe Theater for only one night in December 1910 before it was banned by local authorities. It was also banned in Boston and Philadelphia. The tour took her to from Boston to Jacksonville, through Mississippi, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania, to Canada and Minnesota, usually one new city and one performance every day.|$|E

Stephen Garrett of Time Out said 'Why do <b>good</b> <b>actors</b> {{pop up in}} bad movies? More perplexingly, {{why do so many}} <b>good</b> <b>actors</b> end up in the same bad movie?', while Desson Thomas of The Washington Post wrote 'Even though director-adaptor Mary McGuckian expended much creative energy trying to pump original spirit into the characters, she never brings any of them to life'.|$|R

500|$|Working with {{a budget}} of $200,000, Dassin could not afford top stars for the film. To carry the lead role, Dassin {{selected}} Jean Servais, an actor whose career had slumped due to alcoholism. For Italian gangster Mario Ferrati, Dassin cast Robert Manuel after seeing him perform a comic role {{as a member of}} Comédie-Française. After a suggestion made by the wife of the film's producer, Dassin cast Carl Möhner as Jo the Swede. Dassin would use Möhner again in his next film He Who Must Die. Dassin himself played the role of the Italian safecracker César the Milanese. Dassin explained {{in an interview that he}} [...] "had cast a very <b>good</b> <b>actor</b> in Italy, whose name escapes me, but he never got the contract!...So I had to put on the mustache and do the part myself".|$|E
40|$|In a {{qualitative}} interview study, 20 Hong Kong Chinese informants {{were asked to}} report stories about colleagues who were either ‘good soldiers’ or ‘good actors’. In stories about good soldiers, informants attributed their colleagues 2 ̆ 7 organizational citizenship behaviour (OCB) primarily to prosocial or pro-organizational motives. Informants 2 ̆ 7 stories about <b>good</b> <b>actors</b> broke down into three major subcategories of citizenship-related impression management: OCB attributed primarily to impression management motives; alleged pseudo-OCB concomitant with minimal compliance; and alleged pseudo-OCB concomitant with counterproductive behaviour. When distinguishing good soldiers from <b>good</b> <b>actors,</b> informants adopted two criteria for attribution: wilful behavioural inconsistency, i. e. low generality of behaviour across contexts; and alleged false pretence, i. e. discrepancy between claims or allusions and actual deeds. Our findings partially supported a prior hypothesis from attribution theory, that consistency was a criterion for attribution, but indicated that consensus, i. e. correspondence between the focal colleague 2 ̆ 7 s behaviour and other employees 2 ̆ 7 behaviour, failed to differentiate good soldiers from <b>good</b> <b>actors.</b> Informants generally regarded OCB as socially desirable only when it was attributed primarily to prosocial/pro-organizational motives...|$|R

[...] He proceeded to recommend her to several directors and was thus cast in more roles, although she was relatively unknown outside her hometown in China at this time. Nonetheless, Tang starred in a TV series, Policewoman Swallow (2004) and a brief university drama, Che Guevara (2004). After working with a more diverse group of actresses, she also appeared in TV dramas Leaving Seafront Street (2005), East Meets West (2005) and Born in the 60s (2006).|$|R
500|$|David Duchovny {{initially}} suggested {{having a}} Walter Skinner-centric episode {{as a way}} to give himself a break, although ultimately he still ended up having a large part in the episode. Duchovny felt that Skinner was a good character who was not utilized to his full extent on the show. Duchovny's idea, which was written in collaboration with writer Howard Gordon, also surrounded the conceit that what Mulder and Skinner do comes with a tremendous price. Skinner's popularity amongst fans had risen with his increased role in the episodes [...] "The Blessing Way" [...] and [...] "Paper Clip" [...] and these episodes helped re-establish the ground rules regarding where Skinner stood in regards to the X-Files. Writer Vince Gilligan noted that Skinner was originally intended to be a bad guy, but because Mitch Pileggi was such a <b>good</b> <b>actor</b> the writers decided to not take his character in that direction.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{opinion was}} split about Lazenby; {{he has been}} {{considered}} {{to have been the}} worst Bond, and has variously been described as [...] "laconic and humourless", [...] "a little stiff" [...] and [...] "annoying and smug". Derek Malcolm of The Guardian was dismissive of Lazenby's performance, saying that he [...] "is not a <b>good</b> <b>actor</b> and though I never thought Sean Connery was all that stylish either, there are moments when one yearns for a little of his louche panache". The New York Times critic AH Weiler also weighed in against Lazenby, saying that [...] "Lazenby, if not a spurious Bond, is merely a casual, pleasant, satisfactory replacement". Pauline Kael called Lazenby [...] "quite a dull fellow" [...] in her otherwise positive review in The New Yorker. However, Peter R. Hunt, director of On Her Majesty's Secret Service, stated that Lazenby should have undertaken more films in the role, saying [...] "he would have made a very credible Bond and been very good indeed".|$|E

Both plays ran for 81 performances from December 1905, {{and then went on}} tour. Barrymore continued drinking and lacked discipline, which affected his performances. Ethel was angry with her brother and had the producers fire him from the show, but re-hire him the following day, to teach him a lesson. After a tour of the US and Australia with Collier in On the Quiet and The Dictator, Barrymore joined his sister in the 1907 comedy His Excellency the Governor at the Empire Theatre. He received mixed reviews for his performances, and The Wichita Daily Eagle commented that [...] "Barrymore seems to imitate John Drew too much ever to be a <b>good</b> <b>actor.</b> Why doesn't young Barrymore imitate a real actor if he must copy someone." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of reviews were critical {{of either the}} film, Lazenby, or both, {{while most of the}} contemporary reviews in the British press referred to George Lazenby at some point as [...] "The Big Fry", a reference to his previous acting in [...] Fry's Chocolate [...] advertisements. Derek Malcolm of The Guardian was dismissive of Lazenby's performance, saying that he [...] "is not a <b>good</b> <b>actor</b> and though I never thought Sean Connery was all that stylish either, there are moments when one yearns for a little of his louche panache." [...] For all the criticism of Lazenby, however, Malcolm says that the film was [...] "quite a jolly frolic in the familiar money-spinning fashion". Tom Milne, writing in The Observer was even more scathing, saying that [...] "I... fervently trust (OHMSS) will be the last of the James Bond films. All the pleasing oddities and eccentricities and gadgets of the earlier films have somehow been lost, leaving a routine trail through which the new James Bond strides without noticeable signs of animation." ...|$|E
500|$|Sellers's last {{film was}} The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu, a comedic re-imagining of the eponymous {{adventure}} novels by Sax Rohmer; Sellers played both police inspector Nayland Smith and Fu Manchu, alongside Helen Mirren and David Tomlinson. The {{production of the}} film was troublesome before filming started, with two directors—Richard Quine and John Avildsen—fired before the script had been completed. Sellers also expressed dissatisfaction with his own portrayal of Manchu with his ill-health often causing delays. Arguments between Sellers and director Piers Haggard led to Haggard's firing at Sellers's instigation and Sellers took over direction, using his long-time friend David Lodge to direct some sequences. Tom Shales of The Washington Post described the film as [...] "an indefensibly inept comedy", adding that [...] "it is hard to name another <b>good</b> <b>actor</b> who ever made so many bad movies as Sellers, a comedian of great gifts but ferociously faulty judgment.

He also starred as Adrien opposite Nicholas Tennant in the UK premiére of Members Only at the Trafalgar Studios.

He enjoyed working on it, telling What's on Stage: [...] "Nick is a really <b>good</b> <b>actor</b> and really good to work with in that you can have completely frank discussions about tiny issues and it's totally ego-free. We're all just discussing the point and not playing games with each other. It does make the working practice easier. If there's only two of you in a play, you are equally responsible – there's nobody else to blame if it goes wrong. So its a greater risk and there's no hiding". At the end of the year, he appeared opposite Richard Wilson in Whipping it Up, a play about whips in a fictional David Cameron government. To research his role, he watched more Commons debates.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reaction}} {{towards the}} character was generally mixed. In a DVD {{review of the}} first series, Michael Mackenzie of Home Cinema thought Macfadyen {{was not a very}} <b>good</b> <b>actor</b> and believed [...] "he seems to be in some sort of contest with Keanu Reeves to see how long he can maintain the same lifeless facial expression," [...] but thought the character himself, particularly his personal life, mostly worked well for the most part as it continues [...] "as a standard soap opera." [...] In review of the second series, Dennis Landmann of MovieFreak praised the [...] "drama and intensity that builds around his character," [...] noting Tom's somewhat [...] "haunted soul" [...] and the last five minutes of the last episode [...] "were so powerful they affected how I felt {{for the next couple of}} days; I kept thinking about the character and the tragic events that happened to him." [...] In the third series, Mackenzie praised the episode where Tom tries to clear his name, but thought his exit was [...] "not particularly satisfying."

Borgnine felt he could not say no to the offer because his grandchildren were fans of the show. In the final scene of the episode, Borgnine plays a guitar and sings campfire songs with the children. Borgnine was a guitar player in real life, so he brought his own guitar with him to the recording studio. Borgnine apologized because he felt that he was not being able to sing very well, but Nancy Cartwright, who provides the voice of Bart, thought his voice [...] "added to the authenticity of his character". The Simpsonss creator Matt Groening thought the recording sessions with Borgnine were [...] "so much fun". Hank Azaria, who provides the voice of Apu, commented that Borgnine [...] "had no idea what the hell he was doing.
