40|$|Maser {{polarization}} observations {{can reveal}} unique {{information on the}} magnetic field strength and structure for {{a large number of}} very different astronomical objects. As the different masers for which polarization is measured, such as silicon-monoxide, water, <b>hydroxil</b> and methanol, probe different physical conditions, the masers can even be used to determine for example the relation between magnetic field and density. In particular, maser polarization observations have improved our understanding of the magnetic field strength in, among others, the envelopes around evolved stars, Planetary Nebulae (PNe), massive star forming regions, supernova remnants and megamaser galaxies. This review presents an overview of maser polarization observations and magnetic field determinations of the last several years and discusses some of the theoretical considerations needed for a proper maser polarization analysis...|$|E

A skin friction equation for the turbulent flow of Carreau-Yasuda fluids will be derived assuming a logarithmic behavior of the turbulent mean velocity for the near wall flow out of the viscous sub layer. An alternative near wall characteristic length scale which {{takes into account the}} effects of the relaxation time will be introduced. The characteristic length will be obtained through the analysis of viscous region near the wall. The results compared with experimental data obtained with Tylose (methyl <b>hydroxil</b> cellulose) solutions showing good agreement. The relations between scales integral and dissipative obtained for length, time, velocity, kinetic energy, and vorticity will be derived for this type of fluid.

40|$|Hydroxyapatite is a {{very well}} known ceramic {{biomaterial}} for its great similarity with the mineral {{part of the human}} bone. To increment its bioactivity, calcium, phosphate and <b>hydroxils</b> can be substituted with several species. In the present work, F-substituted hydroxyapatites nanopowders have been synthesized by a simple co-precipitation method and XRD/Rietveld refinement characterization has been performed to understand the influence of the F addition on structural properties such as lattice parameters, crystal size, phase composition, and crystallinity degree. An original ion-exchange chromatography characterization set-up has been developed to assess the real content of fluoride in the samples. Codoped Sr-F apatites have been synthesized and their structural characterization has been performed as described before. A simple method to fluorinate calcium phosphates powders in aqueous solution has been developed. Beta-TCP is found to be converted in F-rich hydroxhyapatite at pH= 7. 5...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate ASTER images for the discrimination of faciological variations in the Serra Branca granite massif in the Tin Province of the Goiás, which comprises several granitoid bodies with metasomatically altered facies mineralized with cassiterite. Classification of the multispectral images using Spectral Angle Mapping (SAM) techniques enhanced previously mapped areas of biotite-granite and metassomatically altered materials. However, due to the presence of the vegetation cover, detection of diagnostic minerals (e. g., muscovite) based on <b>hydroxil</b> absorption features was restricted to a small number of pixels. Results showed that under the savanna tropical environment of the study area, ASTER data were more efficacious for the characterization of rock-soil-vegetation associations than for the discrimination of the spectrally diagnostic mineralogical assemblage derived from the metassomatic activity in the study area.

40|$|AbstractThe thermotropic and {{structural}} effects of {{low molecular weight}} poly(malic acid) (PMLA) on fully hydrated multilamellar dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) –water systems were investigated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and freeze-fracture transmission electron microscopy (FFTEM). Systems of 20 wt% DPPC concentration and 1 and 5 wt% PMLA to lipid ratios were studied. The PMLA derivatives changed the thermal behavior of DPPC significantly and caused a drastic loss in correlation between lamellae in the three characteristic thermotropic states (i. e., in the gel, rippled gel and liquid crystalline phases). In the presence of PBS or NaCl, the perturbation was more moderate. The structural behavior on the atomic level was revealed by FTIR spectroscopy. The molecular interactions between DPPC and PMLA were simulated via modeling its measured infrared spectra, and their peculiar spectral features were interpreted. Through this interpretation, the poly(malic acid) is inferred to attach to the headgroups of the phospholipids through hydrogen bonds between the free <b>hydroxil</b> groups of PMLA and the phosphodiester groups of DPPC...|$|E
40|$|Lignin is {{the most}} {{abundant}} aromatic renewable resource in the world. In wood lignin acts as the glue-molecule for cellulose and it forms 15 - 30 % of the wood material. In the {{pulp and paper industry}} lignin is a by-product in the scale of 50 million tons every year worldwide. Biorefinery concepts add around 20 million tons to this figure. However, only 2 % of total lignin is used as renewable feedstock for example as aggregates or dispersants. The majority is incinerated in the pulp factories to power reactor systems. The aim of this work is to promote the material utilization of lignin and to achieve a new high-value building block for adhesive synthesis. Lignin is a three dimensional irregular macromolecule which consist of 4 -hydroxyphenylpropanoid units with functional groups like <b>hydroxil,</b> methoxy, carbonyl and carboxyl. In order to get an optimized polyol precursor. Not till then it is possible to synthesize waterbourne polyurethane dispersions from this lignin polyol in a typical acetone process. These were characterized by DSC (diffraction scanning calorimetry), SEC (size exclusion chromatography), Zeta potential and light diffraction measurements. The adhesive properties are determined by tensile tests...|$|E
40|$|Cellulose acetate {{is one of}} {{cellulose}} derived from substitution of <b>hydroxil</b> groups (-OH) {{of cellulose}} by acyl groups. The last research resulted cellulose acetate due to acidic catalyst (H 2 SO 4) use and open reactor. Therefore the aims of this research are to get cellulose acetate membrane from biocellulose tuna de coco (BNC) using alkaline catalyst (piridin) and inert reactor, also to characterize membrane to test membrane capability to permeate Mg 2 + ion as well. Cellulose acetate make from biocellulose nata de coco (BNC) was acetylized by acetate acid anhydride and alkaline catalyst (piridin) as well as inert reactor. The cellulose acetate was analyzed by FT 1 R spectroscopy. Membrane characteritations such as permeability, selectivity, and maximum pore size were analyzed with microfiltration instruments, the membrane thickness by micrometer, while the solubility was determined by soaking the membrane in acetone, water and n-heksane. Cellulose acetate membrane then was applied to permeat Mg 2 + ion in feed solution with different concentration. Then Mg 2 + ion concentration in both feed and permeat ion solution were analyzed with AAS method. FTIR Spectra showed carbonyl (C= 0) ester absorption at 1. 751, 2 cm-I and (C- 0) ester absorption at 1. 238, 2 cm - 1 and 1. 164 cm 1. Therefore it was conclude the product was cellulose acetate. Membrane characterization showed, that membrane permeability, membrane selectivity, maximum pore size and thickness membrane were {{in the range of}} 6, 25 - 889, 28 Lm- 2 atm-ijam- 1, 22, 08 - 94, 61 () / 0, 1, 85 - 19, 1 gm, and 1, 51. 10 - 2 - 5, 55. 10 - 2 gm, respectively. The membrane was spuring by dissolve in water. Finally at a constan pressure, the percentage of membrane to permeate Mg 2 + ion decrease when Mgt ion concentration increased. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{thermally}} activated alcali {{ion drift}} during anodic bonding of silicon and borosilicat glasses has been quantitatively characterized {{by means of}} in-situ and ex-situ ERDA-investigations (ERDA: Elastic-Recoil-Detection-Analysis) and activation energies, drift rates and depletion layer thicknesses have been determined. The saturation of the depletion layer thickness is {{in the order of}} few #mu#m. For the first time the drift of hydrogen and oxygen in the near surface layer of TEMPAX-glass was observed. As a source of hydrogen and oxygen the surface leached glass layer can be considered where the dehydrated water exists as H"+- and HO" [...] ions. As a conclusion the transport of oxygen during anodic bonding was explained by the drift of the weakly or non-bounded <b>hydroxil</b> groups. The oxide growth at the glass-silicon-interface in dependence on the drift time can be approximated by a reciprocal logarithmic equation which describes quite well the oxidation at low temperatures and the electrolytical anodic oxidation of metals. Finally, the results indicate an electric field assisted oxide growth supporting the assumption of an anodic oxidation during the silicon-glass-bonding process. The results from investigations of thermally induced stress and relaxation effects in silicon-glass-compounds clarify that the bow of silicon-TEMPAX sandwiches can be adjusted even after anodic bonding. It is possible to reach bows which are smaller or have opposite signs compared to as-bonded wafers. This procedure can be physically explained by structural relaxation effects below the transformation temperature leading to a shrinkage of the glass and therefore to a change of the bow of the wafer compound.
