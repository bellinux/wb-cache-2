25|$|The ethical {{principle}} of confidentiality requires that information shared by a client with a therapist {{in the course}} of treatment is not shared with others. This principle bolsters the therapeutic alliance, as it promotes an environment of trust. There are important exceptions to confidentiality, namely where it conflicts with the clinician's <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>warn</b> or duty to protect. This includes instances of suicidal behavior or homicidal plans, child abuse, elder abuse and dependent adult abuse.|$|E
500|$|If a {{statement}} {{has been made}} by a person after being arrested, it is only admissible if the court is satisfied that a caution along the following lines was administered: [...] "It is my <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>warn</b> {{you that you are}} not obliged to say anything or to answer any question, but anything you say, whether in answer to a question or not, may be given in evidence." [...] However, if a person makes {{a statement}} before there is time to administer a caution, the statement remains admissible if the caution is then administered as soon as possible.|$|E
500|$|Prior to 1957, {{visitors}} to a property were classified in different ways, and this classification determined {{the duty of}} care an owner or tenant had to them. These were [...] "contractors" [...] such as hotel guests (the highest level of duty; a duty {{to ensure that the}} premises were fit {{for the purposes of the}} contract), [...] "invitees", such as a customer in a shop (owed a less onerous duty; a duty to take reasonable care to prevent damage from an unusual danger), [...] "licensees", such as a friend invited to a party (a less onerous duty; a <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>warn</b> of any concealed danger or trap of which the occupier knew) and [...] "uninvited persons" [...] such as trespassers (who were owed no duty of care, except to refrain from deliberately or recklessly causing them harm).|$|E

500|$|The duty {{itself is}} laid out in Section 1(1), and is a duty on the people covered by the act [...] "to see that the work which he takes on is done in a workmanlike or, {{as the case may}} be, {{professional}} manner, with proper materials and so that as regards that work the dwelling will be fit for habitation when completed". This is a three-part test, all parts of which must be fulfilled; if, for example, a house is badly designed but well-built, the architect will be held responsible even though the house is habitable. Those owing a duty can be released from their obligations if they are acting according to the claimant's instructions, under Section 1(2). If they act completely in accordance with the instructions, the duty of care is fulfilled even though the house may not be properly constructed. However, if the claimant instructs the builder to construct a poorly designed and unstable building, the builder has a <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>warn</b> the claimant. Section 2 of the Act excludes [...] "approved scheme" [...] constructions, such as those run by the National House Building Council.|$|E
500|$|Sun {{dogs were}} {{apparently}} well known during the Middle Ages, {{as they are}} mentioned in the Old Farmer's Almanac (Bondepraktikan) which states that the phenomenon forecasts strong winds, and also rain if the sun dogs are more pale than red. According to the passage in the Vasa Chronicle, however, both Petri and {{the master of the}} mint Anders Hansson were sincerely troubled by the appearance of these sun dogs. [...] Petri interpreted the signs over Stockholm as a warning from God and had the Vädersolstavlan painting produced and hung in front of his congregation. [...] Notwithstanding this devotion, he was far from certain on how to interpret these signs and in a sermon delivered in late summer 1535, he explained {{there are two kinds of}} omens: one produced by the Devil to allure mankind away from God, and another produced by God to attract mankind away from the Devil — one being hopelessly difficult to tell from the other. He therefore saw it as his <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>warn</b> both his congregation, mostly composed of German burghers united by their conspiracy against the king, and the king himself.|$|E
2500|$|Customary {{international}} law {{is an important}} source of international environmental law. [...] These are the norms and rules that countries follow as a matter of custom and they are so prevalent that they bind all states in the world. [...] When a principle becomes customary law is not clear cut and many arguments are put forward by states not wishing to be bound. [...] Examples of customary {{international law}} relevant to the environment include the <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>warn</b> other states promptly about icons of an environmental nature and environmental damages to which another state or states may be exposed, and Principle 21 of the Stockholm Declaration ('good neighbourliness' or sic utere).|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{importance}} of genomic information for care of individual patients {{and for the}} development of knowledge about treatment efficacy is becoming increasingly apparent. This information is probabilistic and involves the use of large data sets to increase the likelihood of detecting low frequency events. Duties and rights of patients with respect to this information have been much discussed, including informed consent to the use of individual information, privacy and confidentiality, rights to know or not to know, and individual ownership of information about themselves. But this is only one side of the information equation. On {{the other side of the}} equation are duties of information holders: malpractice and <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> <b>warn,</b> responsibilities of data stewardship, intellectual property and ownership, reciprocity, and justice. This article argues that if we take <b>duties</b> of patients <b>to</b> share information seriously, we must also consider duties on the part of information holders about how they protect and use information...|$|R

2500|$|In {{addition}} to funerals, Phelps and his followers—mostly his own immediate family members—picketed gay pride gatherings, high-profile political events, university commencement ceremonies, live performances of The Laramie Project, and functions sponsored by mainstream Christian groups {{with which he}} had no affiliation, arguing it was their sacred <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>warn</b> others of God's anger. [...] He continued doing so {{in the face of}} numerous legal challenges—some of which reached the U.S. Supreme Court—and near-universal opposition and contempt from other religious groups and the general public. Laws enacted at both the federal and state levels for the specific purpose of curtailing his disruptive activities were limited in their effectiveness due to the Constitutional protections afforded to Phelps under the First Amendment.|$|E
2500|$|Fissures {{within the}} creationist community, which {{had always been}} present, {{continued}} to deepen as fundamentalists received advanced training in the sciences. Geochemist J. Laurence Kulp {{had gone to the}} evangelical school Wheaton College for his undergraduate degree and was a Plymouth Brother. He obtained a PhD from Princeton before taking a faculty position at Columbia. He felt it was his <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>warn</b> fellow Christians in the evangelical scientific organization the American Scientific Affiliation (ASA) of the problems with Price's claims. Kulp wrote a review of Price's work, in which he stated that [...] "major propositions of the theory are contradicted by established physical and chemical laws" [...] in 1950. This caused substantial consternation among his fellow members of the American Scientific Affiliation (ASA), an affiliation of Christians who are also scientists, causing many to claim that Kulp had been contaminated with [...] "the orthodox geological viewpoint" [...] and this was responsible for his faith in the Bible being badly shaken. Kulp's influence, however, continues today within the American Scientific Affiliation, which continues to support old earth creationism.|$|E
2500|$|The company’s {{second book}} was Molokai: An Island in Time by {{photographer}} Richard Cooke III {{that came out}} in 1985. The publishing company relocated to Oregon in 1986 where it was incorporated, and by 1988 Bob Goodman had left the company that had failed to turn a profit after putting out 12 titles. Beyond Words settled on Cohn’s [...] farm near Hillsboro. Both of the first two books were printed by Oregon printer Dynagraphics, Inc., with printing costs exceeding $500,000 for the books that were to retail for $2,000 each. Beyond Words had an exclusive distribution with Waldenbooks for the first two titles, but the deal later fell through. The company was left deeply in debt after these two books, with founder Black taking a job to help pay off the debt. In October 1988, a lawsuit between the printer Dynagraphics and U. S. National Bank concerned Beyond Words’ ability to pay its bill to Dynagraphics for the printing. Dynagraphics won the lawsuit for $321,000 when the jury decided that the bank had a <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>warn</b> Dynagraphics that co-owner Cohn lacked the funds to pay for the printing of the two books that were part of their Earthsong Project.|$|E

5000|$|The AGRs {{were based}} on both coasts at Newport, Rhode Island (later Davisville, Rhode Island) and Treasure Island, California near San Francisco, eight on the East Coast and eight on the West Coast.

Their primary <b>duty</b> was <b>to</b> <b>warn</b> of a surprise Soviet bomber attack. The AGRs were augmented by twelve radar picket destroyer escorts of the [...] and es, known as DERs, and Lockheed WV-2 Warning Star.

50|$|Justice Raymond E.

A <b>duty</b> of care <b>to</b> <b>warn</b> about the dangerous condition of an area is owed to invitees and licensees under these distinctions, but not to trespassers. The majority considered these classifications to be an unhelpful shortcut when determining negligence, and that a general duty of care should be owed to all visitors to land. The summary judgment for the defendant was reversed because the defendant should have warned the plaintiff of the broken handle.|$|R

40|$|The High Court's {{judgment}} in Rogers v Whitaker (1992) 175 CLR 479 has belatedly recognised as persuasive {{the values and}} attitudes of particular patients in what constitutes for them a significant treatment risk. The importance now attached to these subjective patient factors was shown in the High Court's determination that physicians now have a <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> disclose and <b>warn</b> regarding material risks specific to the particular patient. It is our belief that the Rogers v Whitaker emphasis on the requirements for disclosure underscores much of the misinterpretation of consent as a single event or action {{rather than as an}} ever-present sequela of a process which informs decision-making. What is required is a shift in focus from disclosure to understanding and from unilateral information-transfer to the integrated process of shared and informed decision-making...|$|R
