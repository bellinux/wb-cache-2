500|$|The {{edition of}} October 1, 1990 of People {{included}} {{an interview with}} then-First Lady of the United States Barbara Bush. The article included the following passage: [...] "She loves America's Funniest Home Videos but remains baffled after sampling The Simpsons. [...] "It was the dumbest thing I had ever seen," [...] she says, [...] "but it's a family thing, and I guess it's clean." [...] The writers decided to respond by privately sending a polite letter on September 28 to Bush where they posed as Marge Simpson. On October 9, Bush sent a reply: [...] "Dear Marge, How kind of you to write. I'm glad you spoke your mind ... I foolishly didn't know you had one. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>looking</b> {{at a picture of}} you... depicted on a plastic cup... with your blue hair filled with pink birds peeking out all over. Evidently, you and your charming family— Lisa, Homer, Bart and Maggie— are camping out. It's a nice family scene. Clearly you are setting a good example {{for the rest of the}} country. Please forgive a loose tongue." ...|$|E
500|$|Still, Balzac {{believed}} that keeping her letters was dangerous and, {{in a moment}} of characteristic impulse, threw them into the fire. He described it to her as [...] "the saddest and most frightful day of my life... <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>looking</b> at the ashes as I write to you, and I tremble seeing how little space fifteen years takes up." [...] On 5 September 1847 he left Paris to join {{her for the first time}} in Wierzchownia. They spent several happy months together, but financial obligations required his presence in France. The Revolution of 1848 began one week after his return. Back in Wierzchownia, Hańska lost 80,000 francs due to a granary fire, and her time was consumed with three lawsuits. These complications, and Balzac's constant debt, meant that their finances were unstable, and she hesitated anew at the idea of marriage. In any case, a wedding would be impossible without approval from the Tsar, which he did not grant until spring of 1850. On 2 July 1849 Russian authorities responding to Balzac's request in December 1847 to marry Hańska stated that he could do so, but that Hańska could not keep her land.|$|E

Mincham notes that the final aria corresponds to the first in similarity of the scoring with the obbligato instrument, key, and triple time. The final aria is faster, marked [...] "vivace".

2500|$|Collier's {{views on}} {{religion}} and ethics are interesting for their comparison with the views of Thomas and Julian Huxley, both of whom gave Romanes lectures on that subject.

My religion is really negative. [...] can be attained by other means which are less conducive to strife and which put less strain on upon the reasoning faculties." [...] On secular morality: [...] "My standard is frankly utilitarian. As far as morality is intuitive, I think it may be reduced to an inherent impulse of kindliness towards our fellow citizens." [...] His views on ethics, then, were very close to the agnosticism of T.H. Huxley and the humanism of Julian Huxley.|$|E

This way it makes it easy for me to create the atmosphere and the rhythm suitable for the individual dancefloor. Kind of like an open kitchen in a restaurant – it’s an open kitchen in a club bringing the food to the people instantly – as soon as it’s produced it’s already on the dancefloor. What I’m looking for in 2015 is sound reproduction in the clubs being taken a lot more seriously than in the past." ...|$|E
