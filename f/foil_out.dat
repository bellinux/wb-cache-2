50|$|At equilibrium, {{the force}} from the foil and the sail {{will always be}} balanced, so capsize should be impossible, but in {{practice}} {{that is not the}} case. Since the foil's force is relative to the hull's movement through the water, and the sail's force is relative to the wind moving past the sail, sudden changes in wind speed or direction can unbalance the foil and cause heeling. In addition, a foil on the windward side presents an unstable situation, since any lifting of the <b>foil</b> <b>out</b> of the water, by mechanisms such as heeling or wave action, will result in reduced downwards force, potentially leading to capsize. A lee foil provides more stability, as loss of lift will force the foil back into the water.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn {{important}} factor for cost reduction of solar electricity is {{the reduction of}} silicon material quantity used for making a solar cell. It {{is well known in}} the PV industry that kerf losses associated with wafering are a limiting factor in the efforts to reduce material usage and some techniques have been developed to address this issue. The kerfless wafering technique described in this paper provides both things: a thin silicon layer foil while avoiding the sawing step. This technique consists of three steps: (i) dispensing a stress inducing layer on the silicon surface of a slab; (ii) thermal processing to activate the stress and detach a thin silicon layer of silicon; (iii) a chemical cleaning to obtain a flat thin foil of silicon. This technique was used with an epoxy stress inducing layer to obtain thin silicon foils, demonstrating {{for the first time the}} capability to obtain several <b>foils</b> <b>out</b> of the same substrate and using only room temperature cooling step, unlike other authors who used dipping in liquid nitrogen.
