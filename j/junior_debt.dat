40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} jump-diffusion model, in closed form, to price {{corporate}} debt securities, senior and junior, {{with the same}} maturity and violation of the absolute priority rule. We take the structural approach that the firm's asset value follows a jump-diffusion process in a stochastic interest rate economy. Default occurs only if the firm value at the maturity of the corporate debts {{is less than the}} sum of the prespecified face values. Unlike previous models in the structural approach, our model is consistent with the current term structures of credit spreads for both senior and <b>junior</b> <b>debts.</b> In particular, it captures realistic short maturity credit spreads observed in the market. The key idea is to allow the jump intensity to be a time-dependent function. As an application, valuation of credit spread options is presented. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{seniority}} of debt, which {{determines the}} order in which a bankrupt institution repays its debts, is an important and sometimes contentious feature of financial crises, yet its impact on system-wide stability is not well understood. We capture seniority of debt in a multiplex network, a graph of nodes connected by multiple types of edges. Here, an edge between banks denotes a debt contract of a certain level of seniority. Next we study cascading default. There exist multiple kinds of bankruptcy, indexed by the highest level of seniority at which a bank cannot repay all its debts. Self-interested banks would prefer that all their loans be made at the most senior level. However, mixing debts of different seniority levels makes the system more stable, in that it shrinks the set of network densities for which bankruptcies spread widely. We compute the optimal ratio of senior to <b>junior</b> <b>debts,</b> which we call the optimal seniority ratio, for two uncorrelated Erdos-Renyi networks. If institutions erode their buffer against insolvency, then this optimal seniority ratio rises; in other words, if default thresholds fall, then more loans should be senior. We generalize the analytical results to arbitrarily many levels of seniority and to heavy-tailed degree distributions. Comment: 16 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

50|$|The {{short-term}} securities that a SIV issues often contain two tiers of liabilities, junior and senior, with a leverage ratio ranging from 10 to 15. The senior debt is invariably rated AAA/Aaa/AAA and A-1+/P-1/F1 (usually by two rating agencies). The <b>junior</b> <b>debt</b> {{may or may}} not be rated, but when rated it is usually in the BBB area. There may be a mezzanine tranche rated A. The senior debt is a pari passu combination of medium-term notes (MTN) and commercial paper (CP). The <b>junior</b> <b>debt</b> traditionally comprises puttable, rolling 10-year bonds, but shorter maturities and bullet notes became more common.|$|E
50|$|The issuing company forms a Delaware trust (a Connecticut {{trust is}} also common) and holds 100% {{of the common}} stock of the trust. The trust then issues {{preferred}} stock to investors.

In exchange, the company issues <b>junior</b> subordinated <b>debt</b> to the trust with essentially the same terms as the trust's preferred stock. All steps except {{the formation of the}} trust occur simultaneously. If the issuing company is a bank holding company, it will also usually guarantee the interest and maturity payments on the trust preferred stock.|$|R

40|$|Economic policy {{reform that}} creates {{opportunities}} for new productive activities often shifts wealth from {{one set of}} agents toward another, creating reason for political pressure against the reform. The author explores how government financial guarantees secure the political support of the reform's"losers. "Governnment guarantees have two effects: 1) they will probably lead to a bailout of some firms'obligations to debtholders. This bailout must be financed by taxes on the cash flows from old and new projects, and tax collection involves a resource cost; 2) {{the existence of the}} guarantees distorts entrepreneurs'investment incentives by creating an incentive to invest in overly risky projects and not to invest in safe new projects. The author demonstrates that government guarantees on existing debt, combined with the use of <b>junior</b> secured <b>debt</b> to finance new projects, would mitigate the problem of underinvestment in safe projects and overinvestment in risky projects. The potentially positive role of government financial guarantees after economic reform does not imply that prudential banking standards fail to apply during a period of economic reform. If anything, prudential standards are more important during such a period. But it does imply that a financial bailout may be a lagging indicator of a successful policy to offer financial guarantees to potential losers, so they will support reform.

40|$|European {{leaders and}} the European Commission are {{to be commended for}} {{starting}} a dialogue on the issue of burden-sharing with the private sector during banking and sovereign debt crises. Current proposals for dealing with bank and sovereign debt problems appear to assume that we can get through the next few years without debt write-downs or a further crisis, so the role of new resolution procedures is to deal with some future crises that will not happen for a number of years. This approach is based on wishful thinking. A future transition to a world in which newly-issued bank and sovereign bonds are treated as <b>junior</b> to previouslyissued <b>debt</b> would most likely produce a bigger crisis than the one seen last year. The European Union needs to accept the seriousness of current problems and also that dealing successfully with these problems may require writing down existing debt...|$|R
50|$|In finance, {{seniority}} {{refers to}} the order of repayment {{in the event of a}} sale or bankruptcy of the issuer. Seniority can refer to either debt or preferred stock. Senior debt must be repaid before subordinated (or <b>junior)</b> <b>debt</b> is repaid. Each security, either debt or equity, that a company issues has a specific seniority or ranking. Bonds that have the same seniority in a company's capital structure are described as being pari passu. Preferred stock is senior to common stock in a sale when preferred shareholders must receive back their preference, typically their original investment amount, before the common shareholders receive anything.|$|E
50|$|The {{result of}} having {{excessive}} debt {{is that any}} earnings generated by new investment projects are partially appropriated by existing debt holders. A firm facing debt overhang cannot issue new <b>junior</b> <b>debt</b> because default is likely. Moreover, more debt will make the problems of debt overhang worse not better. In addition, the firm's shareholders {{do not want to}} issue new stock because this forces shareholders to bear some of the losses that would have been borne by junior creditors. Thus, the firm refuses to fund projects with a positive NPV. This problem was first discussed by Myers (1977).|$|E
5000|$|Although a deed {{of trust}} usually {{states that the}} {{borrower}} is making an [...] "irrevocable" [...] transfer to the trustee, it is common in many jurisdictions for borrowers to obtain second and third mortgages or trust deeds that make similar transfers to additional trustees (that is, of a property they already conveyed to the trustee on their first deed of trust). As with mortgages, deeds of trust {{are subject to the}} rule [...] "first in time, first in right," [...] meaning that the beneficiary of the first recorded deed of trust may foreclose and wipe out all junior deeds of trust recorded later in time. If this happens, the <b>junior</b> <b>debt</b> still exists, but may become unsecured. If the debtor has sufficient senior secured claims upon his assets, lacks equity, or is otherwise insolvent, the junior liens may be wiped out completely in bankruptcy.|$|E
5000|$|Alternately, {{a capital}} note is {{a bond with}} a very long {{maturity}} horizon, reaching several decades (sometimes as much as 50 or 100 years). Unlike equity securities, these capital notes do mature at some point; therefore, they form part of the company's liabilities and not part of equity. However, since their maturity is {{so far in the}} future, they are treated as equity for practical purposes; the company keeps the money raised through them inside its balance sheet for a very long time. Banks and other financial institutions issue these bonds to satisfy regulatory demands regarding capital requirements, specifically under the Basel Accords. In the Basel [...] "tiers" [...] system, capital notes are treated as close to equity, as both reinforce the bank's [...] "capital". Additionally, bank capital notes are usually not collateralized and are contractually subordinated, forming a <b>junior</b> class of <b>debt.</b> Similar terms might be found in redeemable preferred shares.|$|R
40|$|Corporate {{reorganization}} under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code {{is built}} on {{the foundation of the}} absolute priority rule, which requires that senior creditors be paid in full before any value can be distributed to junior creditors. The standard law and economics understanding is that absolute priority follows inevitably from the 2 ̆ 2 creditors 2 ̆ 7 bargain 2 ̆ 2 model. That model tells us that the optimal system of reorganization must respect nonbankruptcy contract rights while maximizing the expected value of assets in bankruptcy. The conventional wisdom is that absolute priority fits this bill as the singular way of protecting creditors 2 ̆ 7 nonbankruptcy contract rights. But what if this conventional wisdom is incorrect? A closer look at the structure of corporate debt suggests that it is. <b>Junior</b> creditors issue <b>debt</b> supported by the residual value of the debtor firm. The repayment of that debt is contingent on the future value of the firm: the junior creditors receive any future value that exceeds the face value of the senior debt. It is well recognized that this right is the equivalent of a call option on the firm 2 ̆ 7 s assets. And yet Chapter 11 destroys the value of that call option by collapsing all future possibilities to present-day value. Thus, absolute priority eliminates the nonbankruptcy contract rights of junior creditors and creates new rights in going-concern value for senior creditors. This Article examines the potential of an alternative priority mechanism that protects both the junior creditors 2 ̆ 7 call-option value and the senior creditors 2 ̆ 7 nonbankruptcy contract rights. This mechanism-which I call Option-Preservation Priority-is shown to protect the nonbankruptcy contract rights of all creditors and maximize the expected value of assets in bankruptcy...|$|R
50|$|In May 2010 the two economists Jakob von Weizsäcker and Jacques Delpla {{published}} an article proposing a mix of traditional national bonds (red bonds) and jointly issued eurobonds (blue bonds) to prevent debt crises in weaker countries, {{while at the same}} time enforcing fiscal sustainability. According to the proposal EU member states should pool up to 60 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) of their national debt under joint and several liability as senior sovereign debt (blue tranche), thereby reducing the borrowing cost for that part of the debt. Any national debt beyond a country's blue bond allocation (red tranche) should be issued as national and <b>junior</b> <b>debt</b> with sound procedures for an orderly default, thus increasing the marginal cost of public borrowing and helping to enhance fiscal discipline. Participating countries must also establish an Independent Stability Council voted on by member states parliaments to propose annually an allocation for the blue bond and to safeguard fiscal responsibility.|$|E
50|$|The first {{authors to}} {{consider}} structural models for financial systems where each firm could own debt {{of any other}} firm were Eisenberg and Noe in 2001. In their model, no equity could be cross-owned, and debt had to be of one seniority level, only. In 2002, Suzuki published a model in which equity could be cross-owned as well. His model was developed independently of Eisenberg and Noe's. Elsinger's publication of 2009 {{was the first in}} which debt could be of different seniorities, hence allowing to model, for instance, senior and <b>junior</b> <b>debt,</b> while correctly accounting for the order of priority. His model allowed equity cross-ownership, too. With Fischer (2014), the first model which also allowed derivatives was introduced. The fact that Elsinger was unaware of Suzuki's publications, Fischer was unaware of Elsinger's, and the fact that other authors re-discovered parts of Suzuki's and Elsinger's results shows thatthe research in this field is still somewhat unconsolidated.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Using {{a sample}} of European {{commercial}} banks over the period 1993 - 2006, we show that market discipline significantly and positively affects banks ' capital buffer. By distinguishing junior from senior debt holders, we find that both types of investors exert a pressure on banks to hold more capital but that the pressure exerted by <b>junior</b> <b>debt</b> holders is higher. Furthermore, <b>junior</b> <b>debt</b> holders exert a pressure on banks whatever {{the importance of their}} non-traditional activities. By contrast, we find that senior debt holders exert a pressure only on banks that are heavily involved in non-traditional activities that are badly taken into account in the current bank capital regulation framework.
