Studies in rodents have shown that the conversion of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) to DHEA-sulfate is involved in learning and the memory process. METHODS: The effects of a range of plasticizers and related compounds commonly encountered in the environment were evaluated kinetically against human DHEA sulfotransferase (SULT 2 A 1) and by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) against several enzymes involved in the synthesis of the sulfotransferase cofactor adenosine 3 ´-phosphate 5 ´-phosphosulfate (PAPS). RESULTS: We found that several of the chemicals acted as competitive inhibitors of SULT 2 A 1 (K i for 4 -tert-octylphenol is 2. 8 µM).

40|$|Recently, {{several authors}} {{described}} measurements of liquid viscosities higher than 100 mPa · s, using the vibrating wire technique in the forced oscillation mode of operation. The {{use of a}} vibrating wire instrument to measure increasingly higher viscosities poses experimental difficulties due to the consequent decrease of the quality factor of the resonance.

Human biological monitoring data on DINP and DIDP are scrutinised to assess the suitability of these metabolites as biomarkers of exposure. Results from studies carried out in animals and humans indicate that phthalates are metabolised rapidly and do not bioaccmulate.

We found by RT-PCR that the following NRs were expressed: ERα, ERβ, PPARα, PPARβ, PPARγ, RXR. Plasticizers were chosen based on their computational affinity for these receptors. NPs were exposed for 24 - 48 hours to endogenous and synthetic estrogens (17 -β-estradiol and ethinyl estradiol) and to the following plasticizers: Bisphenol A, Diisononyl phthalate, <b>Diisodecyl</b> <b>phthalate,</b> Diethileneglicol benzoate. Both estrogens were able to increase cell proliferation by about 30 % at 24 hrs. Bisphenol-A (10 nM) had an estrogen-like behavior in enhancing cell number, but its action was still significant at 48 hrs. At 200 nM concentration, all plasticizers determined an early increase in proliferation, however only DiDP and DGB were able to sustain this positive modulation for 48 hrs. Ongoing studies in our lab will determine the cellular pathways activated by these EDCs in NPs, in order to earn greater insight into how these molecules may influence and perturb the neurogenic process...|$|E
40|$|Evidence that endocrine-disrupting {{chemicals}} (EDCs) may target metabolic disturbances, beyond {{interference with}} {{the functions of the}} endocrine systems has recently accumulated. Among EDCs, phthalate plasticizers like the <b>diisodecyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (DiDP) are commonly found contaminants of aquatic environments and have been suggested to function as obesogens by activating peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs), a subset of nuclear receptors (NRs) that act as metabolic sensors, playing pivotal roles in lipid homeostasis. However, {{little is known about the}} modulation of PPAR signaling pathways by DiDP in ﬁsh. In this study, we have ﬁrst investigated the ligand binding eﬃciency of DiDP to the ligand binding domains of PPARs and retinoid-X-receptor-α (RXRα) proteins in ﬁsh using a molecular docking approach. Furthermore, in silico predictions were integrated by in vitro experiments to show possible dose-relationship eﬀects of DiDP on PPAR:RXR-dependent gene expression pathways using sea bream hepatocytes. We observed that DiDP shows high binding eﬃciency with piscine PPARs demonstrating a greater preference for RXRα. Our studies also demonstrated the coordinate increased expression of PPARs and RXRα, as well as their downstream target genes in vitro. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed the strength of relationship between transcription of most genes involved in fatty acid metabolism and PPAR mRNA levels. In particular, fatty acid binding protein (FABP) was highly correlated to all PPARs. The results of this study suggest that DiDP can be considered an environmental stressor that activates PPAR:RXR signaling to promote long-term changes in lipid homeostasis leading to potential deleterious physiological consequences in teleost ﬁsh...|$|E
40|$|The {{urban water}} system is {{believed}} to be an important sink for the nonpoint-source pollutants nonylphenols and phthalates. The presence of nonylphenols (NPs), nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEOs), and eight phthalates was analyzed in urban stormwater and sediment from three catchment areas in Sweden. Emission loads for these substances were then calculated for a specific urban catchment area. In addition, substance distribution in road runoff passing through a sedimentation facility was modeled using a modified QWASI-model for chemical fate. High concentrations of DEHP, DIDP and DINP (≤ 48, 66 and 200 µg/g dw, respectively) as well as nonylphenol mono- and di-ethoxylate (6. 6 and 20 µg/g dw, respectively) were found in the sediment. Aqueous concentrations of the pollutants varied considerably; branched NP was detected in concentrations up to 1. 2 µg/L, whereas di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), <b>diisodecyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (DIDP), and diisononyl phthalate (DINP) were the most frequently detected phthalates in concentrations up to 5. 0, 17 and 85 µg/L, respectively. The fate modeling demonstrated that predicted substance levels in water agreed well with measured levels, whereas the modeled sediment levels were underestimated. Calculation of catchment area emission factors from an urban highway environment revealed that as much as 2. 1 kg of total phthalates and 200 g of NP and NPEOs may be emitted per hectare and year. The results indicate that all monitored phthalates, branched NPs and lower NPEOs are present in Swedish urban water systems. The long-chain phthalates DIDP and DINP are believed to occur at higher concentrations than other phthalates because of their higher environmental persistence and their increasing use in Sweden...|$|E
40|$|High molecular-weight {{phthalate}}s, such as {{diisononyl phthalate}} (DINP), and <b>diisodecyl</b> <b>phthalate</b> (DIDP), {{are widely used}} as plasticizers in the manufacturing of polymers and consumer products. Human biological monitoring studies have employed the metabolites of DINP and DIDP as biomarkers to assess human exposure. In this review, we summarize and analyze publicly available scientific data on chemistry, metabolism, and excretion kinetics, of DINP and DIDP, to identify specific and sensitive metabolites. Human biological monitoring data on DINP and DIDP are scrutinised to assess the suitability of these metabolites as biomarkers of exposure. Results from studies carried out in animals and humans indicate that phthalates are metabolised rapidly and do not bioaccmulate. During Phase-I metabolism, ester hydrolysis of DINP and DIDP leads {{to the formation of}} hydrolytic monoesters. These primary metabolites undergo further oxidation reactions to produce secondary metabolites. Hence, the levels of secondary metabolites of DINP and DIDP in urine are found to be always higher than the primary metabolites. Results from human biological monitoring {{studies have shown that the}} secondary metabolites of DINP and DIDP in urine were detected in almost all tested samples, while the primary metabolites were detected in only about 10 % of the samples. This indicates that the secondary metabolites are very sensitive biomarkers of DINP/DIDP exposure while primary metabolites are not. The NHANES data indicate that the median concentrations of MCIOP and MCINP (secondary metabolites of DINP and DIDP, resp.) at a population level are about 5. 1 [*]μg/L and 2. 7 [*]μg/L, respectively. Moreover, the available biological monitoring data suggest that infants/children are exposed to higher levels of phthalates than adults...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Environmental {{epidemiology}} and biomonitoring studies typically rely on biological samples to assay {{the concentration of}} non-persistent exposure biomarkers. Between-participant variations in sampling conditions of these biological samples constitute a potential source of exposure misclassification. Few studies attempted to correct biomarker levels for this error. We aimed to assess the influence of sampling conditions on concentrations of urinary biomarkers of select phenols and phthalates, two widely-produced families of chemicals, and to standardize biomarker concentrations on sampling conditions. Methods Urine samples were collected between 2002 and 2006 among 287 pregnant women from Eden and Pélagie cohorts, from which phthalates and phenols metabolites levels were assayed. We applied a 2 -step standardization method based on regression residuals. First, the influence of sampling conditions (including sampling hour, duration of storage before freezing) and of creatinine levels on biomarker concentrations were characterized using adjusted linear regression models. In the second step, the model estimates were used to remove the variability in biomarker concentrations due to sampling conditions and to standardize concentrations as if all samples had been collected under the same conditions (e. g., same hour of urine collection). Results Sampling hour was associated with concentrations of several exposure biomarkers. After standardization for sampling conditions, median concentrations differed by ‒ 38 [*]% for 2, 5 -dichlorophenol to + 80 [*]% for a metabolite of <b>diisodecyl</b> <b>phthalate.</b> However, at the individual level, standardized biomarker levels were strongly correlated (correlation coefficients above 0. 80) with unstandardized measures. Conclusions Sampling conditions, such as sampling hour, should be systematically collected in biomarker-based studies, in particular when the biomarker half-life is short. The 2 -step standardization method based on regression residuals that we proposed in order to limit the impact of heterogeneity in sampling conditions could be further tested in studies describing levels of biomarkers or their influence on health. </p...|$|E
