Regular route traffic from Helsinki to Stockholm, Tallinn, and St. Petersburg began as far back as 1837. Over 300 cruise ships and 360,000 cruise passengers visit Helsinki annually. There are international cruise ship docks in South Harbour, Katajanokka, West Harbour, and Hernesaari. Helsinki is the second busiest passenger port in Europe with approximately 11 million passengers in 2013. Ferry connections to Tallinn, Mariehamn, and Stockholm are serviced by various companies. Finnlines passenger-freight ferries to Gdynia, Poland; Travemünde, Germany; and Rostock, Germany are also available.

Within the city there was the same ceaseless activity. Here groups of men were unloading the canal boats which had arrived from the river. There porters were transporting bales of merchandise or sacks of grain from a warehouse to a pier, or from one landing to another The occasional parading of the king's guards, or the arrival and <b>departure</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> of war to land or to take away bodies of armed men, were occurrences that sometimes intervened to interrupt, or as perhaps the people then would have said, to adorn this scene of useful industry; and now and then, for a brief period, these peaceful vocations would be wholly suspended and set aside by a revolt or by a civil war, waged by rival brothers against each other, or instigated by the conflicting claims of a mother and son. These interruptions, however, were comparatively few, and, in ordinary cases, not of long continuance. It was for the interest of all branches of the royal line to do as little injury as possible to the commercial and agricultural operations of the realm. In fact, it was on the prosperity of those operations that the revenues depended. The rulers were well aware of this, and so, however implacably two rival princes may have hated one another, and however desperately each party may have struggled to destroy all active combatants whom they should find in arms against them, they were both under every possible inducement to spare the private property and the lives of the peaceful population. This population, in fact, engaged thus in profitable industry, constituted, with the avails of their labors, the very estate for which the combatants were contending.|$|E

40|$|The {{shipping}} {{industry is}} reliant on port authorities for the facilitation of safe entry and <b>departure</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> at the ports. This role {{can not be}} fulfilled without the assistance of harbour tugs which are run by the marine operations section of the Transnet National Ports Authority. The tugs have {{to be safe and}} efficient in the process of pulling and pushing ships around the harbour. Harbour tugs are expensive to acquire and to maintain. The marine operations business has to make appropriate choices of tug propulsion design in order to realise the benefits of the tugs acquired by the ports authority. This can be achieved by analysing the current tugs that the operations are using, which will then serve as valuable information when the time for asset replacement is due. The researcher chose to use the two tug propulsion designs currently used by the Port Elizabeth harbour tugs as a basis for this analysis. The analysis links the three factors of maintenance management, equipment efficiency and equipment safety, to the minimisation of operational costs as perceived by the tug personnel, the pilots and the marine managers. This study seeks to verify the link between these factors and the perceived minimisation of operational costs. Available literature was reviewed and data was collected using a suitably designed questionnaire for this research. This research paper has led to recommendations that should inform the tug acquisition decisions and raise the awareness of the marine employees to relate the factors set out above to minimise operational cost...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: American Creole cattle presumably {{descend from}} animals {{imported}} from the Iberian Peninsula {{during the period of}} colonization and settlement, through different migration routes, and may have also suffered the influence of cattle directly imported from Africa. The introduction of European cattle, which began in the 18 th century, and later of Zebu from India, has threatened the survival of Creole populations, some of which have nearly disappeared or were admixed with exotic breeds. Assessment of the genetic status of Creole cattle is essential for the establishment of conservation programs of these historical resources. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We sampled 27 Creole populations, 39 Iberian, 9 European and 6 Zebu breeds. We used microsatellite markers to assess the origins of Creole cattle, and to investigate the influence of different breeds on their genetic make-up. The major ancestral contributions are from breeds of southern Spain and Portugal, in agreement with the historical ports of <b>departure</b> <b>of</b> <b>ships</b> sailing towards the Western Hemisphere. This Iberian contribution to Creoles may also include some African influence, given the influential role that African cattle have had in the development of Iberian breeds, but the possibility of a direct influence on Creoles of African cattle imported to America can not be discarded. In addition to the Iberian influence, the admixture with other European breeds was minor. The Creoles from tropical areas, especially those from the Caribbean, show clear signs of admixture with Zebu. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Nearly five centuries since cattle were first brought to the Americas, Creoles still show a strong and predominant signature of their Iberian ancestors. Creole breeds differ widely from each other, both in genetic structure and influences from other breeds. Efforts are needed to avoid their extinction or further genetic erosion, which would compromise centuries of selective adaptation {{to a wide range of}} environmental conditions...|$|E
