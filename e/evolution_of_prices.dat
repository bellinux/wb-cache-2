50|$|In the 1980s {{asset market}} {{experiments}} pioneered by Prof. Vernon Smith (2002 Economics Nobel Laureate) and collaborators provided a new tool to study microeconomics and finance. In particular these posed {{a challenge to}} classical economics by showing that participants when participants traded (with real money) an asset with a well defined value the price would soar well above the fundamental value that {{is defined by the}} experimenters. Repetition of this experiment under various conditions showed the robustness of the phenomenon. By designing new experiments, Profs. Caginalp, Smith and David Porter largely resolved this paradox through the framework of the asset flow equations. In particular, the bubble size (and more generally, the asset price) was highly correlated by the excess cash in the system, and momentum was also shown to be a factor 19. In classical economics there would be just one quantity, namely the share price that has units of dollars per share. The experiments showed that this is distinct from the fundamental value per share. The liquidity, L, introduced by Caginalp and collaborators, is a third quantity that also has these units 20. The temporal <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> involves a complex relationship among these three variables, together with quantities reflecting the motivations of the traders that may involve price trend and other factors. Other studies have shown quantitatively that motivations in the experimental traders are similar to those in world markets.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to provide an optimizing model of wage and price setting consistent with U. S. data.

In this part I seek to determine whether a standard specification of consumption/leisure preferences is consistent with the data, and to what extent nominal or real rigidities in the wage setting process improve the fit withthedata. Then I combine the evolution of wages predicted by this model with the <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>prices</b> predicted by staggered-price models to provide a model of the joint determination of prices and wages, given the evolution of real quantities.
