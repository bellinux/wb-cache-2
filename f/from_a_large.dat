5|$|Adults have {{forewings}} {{that are}} yellowish brown {{in color and}} have a dark spot located {{in the center of}} their body. The moths have a wingspan ranging from 32 to 45mm, and live over thirty days in optimal conditions. However, the life span ranges from five to fifteen days on average. They are nocturnal and hide in vegetation during the day. Adult moths collect nectar or other plant exudates <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> number of plants, and live for 12 to 16 days. Females can lay up to 2,500 eggs in their lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Beagle {{required}} {{large numbers}} of chronometers because some would inevitably break down on long voyages and the chronometers were essential for {{the mission of the}} ship. Further, the rates of all chronometers vary with time. Although this can be allowed for by interpolating between the regular rate checks, {{there is no guarantee that}} the changes are linear, and often they are not. Averaging the readings <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> number of chronometers, especially if they are of a variety of types, will tend to cancel out such errors.|$|E
5|$|Because it isn't {{as close}} to its star as its sister planets Kepler-11b and Kepler-11c, the Kepler team {{suggests}} that its light density may come <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> hydrogen and helium atmosphere {{that has not been}} blown away by the stellar wind.|$|E

5|$|Dactyl {{may have}} {{originated}} {{at the same}} time as Ida, from the disruption of the Koronis parent body. However, it may have formed more recently, perhaps as ejecta <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> impact on Ida. It is extremely unlikely that it was captured by Ida. Dactyl may have suffered a major impact around 100 million years ago, which reduced its size.|$|E
5|$|For {{several days}} Frusciante and Kiedis {{worked on the}} song, and it {{became one of the}} few tracks written and {{completed}} prior to the band moving into The Mansion where they recorded the album.

5|$|In 1960, Democrats {{nominated}} {{former governor}} Keen Johnson, then {{an executive with}} Reynolds Metals, to oppose Cooper's re-election bid.

Kennedy as a reaction against Kennedy's Catholicism in the 1960 presidential election.

5|$|Teeth {{from what}} is now {{documented}} as a Tyrannosaurus rex were found in 1874 by Arthur Lakes near Golden, Colorado.

5|$|Wage growth {{beginning}} in 1950 pushed prices up. The inflation rate increased faster, and soon real wages fell. High inflation prompted a stabilization plan that included tighter monetary policy, {{a cut in}} public expenditures, and increases in taxes and utility prices. Increasing economic wariness as the 1950s progressed {{became one of the}} leading causes for Perón's downfall in the Revolución Libertadora of 1955, as the working classes saw their quality of life diminished, thus stripping Perón <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> part of his popular support.|$|E
5|$|A {{partial eclipse}} {{occurs when the}} Sun and Moon are not exactly {{in line with the}} Earth and the Moon only {{partially}} obscures the Sun. This phenomenon can usually be seen <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> part of the Earth outside of the track of an annular or total eclipse. However, some eclipses can only be seen as a partial eclipse, because the umbra passes above the Earth's polar regions and never intersects the Earth's surface. Partial eclipses are virtually unnoticeable in terms of the sun's brightness, as it takes well over 90% coverage to notice any darkening at all. Even at 99%, it would be no darker than civil twilight. Of course, partial eclipses (and partial stages of other eclipses) can be observed if one is viewing the sun through a darkening filter (which should always be used for safety).|$|E

5|$|Aarhus is the {{principal}} centre for education in the Jutland region. It draws students <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> area, especially from the western and southern parts of the peninsula. The relatively large influx of young people and students creates a natural base for cultural activities. Aarhus has the greatest concentration of students in Denmark, fully 12% of citizens attending short, medium or long courses of study. In addition to around 25 institutions of higher education, several research forums have evolved {{to assist in the}} transfer of expertise from education to business. The city is home to more than 52,000 students.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{is home to}} {{the oldest}} {{building}} on the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, the Gotchen Creek Guard Station just south of the A. G. Aiken Lava Bed. Built in 1909, it served as the administrative headquarters of the Mount Adams District until 1916. It was built along a major grazing trail to allow for easy monitoring of the thousands of sheep grazed on the lower slopes. Later, in the 1940s, as the amount of grazing decreased, the station housed the Forest Guards responsible for the area. In 2008, it was wrapped in protective foil as a precautionary method to shield it <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> wildfire, the Cold Springs Fire, although the fire did not come near enough to burn it. Wildfires in 2012 (Cascade Creek Fire) and 2015 (Cougar Creek Fire) also required this precaution, and neither of them came close enough either.|$|E
5|$|At {{daylight}} 4th Parachute Brigade {{started moving}} east towards the division at Oosterbeek, where the KOSB, {{moving through the}} night, had already arrived. Only the parachute battalions and brigade troops remained outside of the village. The order of march was 10 Para followed by brigade troops then 156 Para bringing up the rear. Virtually surrounded, the brigade fought a running hand-to-hand battle with German infantry supported by armour as they attempted to break through. During the fighting commanding officer Lieutenant-Colonel Des Voeux and the second in command of 156 Para were killed in action. Another high ranking casualty was the commanding officer of 10 Para Lieutenant-Colonel Ken Smyth, who was wounded and became a prisoner of war. With 156 Para leading, {{the remnants of the}} brigade carried out a bayonet charge and cleared the Germans <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> hollow which provided some shelter for the exhausted troops. Pinned down all day and with their numbers dwindling, at 17:00 Brigadier Hackett led a charge towards the divisions position, only the Brigadier and 150 men made it.|$|E

5|$|At this point, NY75 turns northeastward, {{overlapping}} with US62 into {{the nearby town}} of Hamburg along Gowanda State Road. Development along the highway quickly rises in density <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> farm and a pocket of homes {{at the start of the}} concurrency to a series of residential streets across the town line that make up the hamlet of Water Valley. The influx of homes brings US62 and NY75 across the main channel of Eighteenmile Creek and into the village of Hamburg, where the highway changes names to Pierce Avenue. The two routes remain concurrent for three blocks to an intersection with Lake Avenue, where Pierce Avenue becomes Main Street. While US62 continues east into Hamburg's central business district on Main Street, NY75 follows Lake Street northward along the mostly residential western edge of the village.|$|E
5|$|Bite force {{estimates}} for Deinonychus were first produced in 2005, based on reconstructed jaw musculature. This {{study concluded that}} Deinonychus likely had a maximum bite force only 15% that of the modern American alligator. A 2010 study by Paul Gignac and colleagues attempted to estimate the bite force based directly on newly discovered Deinonychus tooth puncture marks in the bones of a Tenontosaurus. These puncture marks came <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> individual, and provided the first evidence that large Deinonychus could bite through bone. Using the tooth marks, Gignac's team were able to determine that the bite force of Deinonychus {{was significantly higher than}} earlier studies had estimated by biomechanical studies alone. They found the bite force of Deinonychus to be between 4,100 and 8,200 newtons, greater than living carnivorous mammals including the hyena, and equivalent to a similarly sized alligator.|$|E
5|$|D'Eyncourt, who had {{departed}} Brazil in October {{immediately after the}} contract was signed, returned in March 1911 to display the various design options available to the Brazilian Navy. Armstrong evidently thought the second faction would prevail, so he also took with him everything needed to close a deal on Bacellar's design. By mid-March, Armstrong's contacts in Brazil reported that Leão had convinced the recently elected President Hermes Rodrigues da Fonseca to cancel the design with twelve 14-inch guns {{in favor of a}} smaller ship. The credit may not have laid with Leão alone, though; da Fonseca was already dealing with multiple issues. Most importantly, he {{had to deal with the}} fallout <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> naval revolt in November 1910 (the Revolt of the Lash), which had seen three of the new vessels just purchased by the navy, along with one older coast-defense ship, mutiny against the use of corporal punishment in the navy.|$|E
