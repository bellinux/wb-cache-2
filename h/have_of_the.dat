5|$|Ray {{gathered}} an inexperienced crew, {{although both}} his cameraman Subrata Mitra and art director Bansi Chandragupta {{went on to}} achieve great acclaim. The cast consisted of mostly amateur actors. He started shooting in late 1952 with his personal savings and hoped to raise more money once he had some passages shot, but did not succeed on his terms. As a result, Ray shot Pather Panchali over three years, an unusually long period, based on when he or his production manager Anil Chowdhury could raise additional funds. He refused funding from sources who wanted a change in script or supervision over production. He also ignored advice from the government to incorporate a happy ending, but he did receive funding {{that allowed him to}} complete the film. Ray showed an early film passage to the American director John Huston, who was in India scouting locations for The Man Who Would Be King. The passage was of the vision which Apu and his sister <b>have</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> train running through the countryside, the only sequence which Ray had yet filmed due to his small budget. Huston notified Monroe Wheeler at the New York Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) that a major talent was on the horizon.|$|E

And so again at the very end, just before the dissolution, the silence of Bishop Longland, and the king's choice of the priory for the solemn announcement of his divorce from Catherine of Aragon, constitute an indirect evidence in favour of the house. On the whole the priory of Dunstable shows a very good record {{in the matter of}} discipline and order, with only a few lapses.|$|E

500|$|The episode employs what {{literary}} theorist Mikhail Bakhtin {{calls the}} carnivalesque. As Ethan Thompson explains in his article, [...] "Good Demo, Bad Taste: South Park as Carnivalesque Satire", the style {{consists of four}} crucial elements: humor, bodily excess, linguistic games that challenge official discourse, and the inversion of social structures. Cartman's body—his obesity and his inability to control his farting—is supposed to exemplify the grotesque. The boys swear throughout the episode, using words and phrases such as [...] "fat ass" [...] and [...] "dildo", challenging the boundaries of appropriate language. Finally, the social structure of the town is inverted, as the episode focuses on {{the knowledge that the}} four boys <b>have</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aliens as opposed to the ignorant and incompetent adults.

500|$|The South Park {{football}} team plays a rival team from Middle Park, Colorado. Like South Park itself, Middle Park is an actual basin in the Rocky Mountains of north-central Colorado.

He also switched the emphasis of the play away from the love-friendship dichotomy and instead focused {{on the issues of}} fidelity, with the last line of the play altered to, [...] "Lovers must be faithful to be bless'd." [...] This necessitated rewriting Valentine as a near flawless protagonist who represents such faithfulness, and Proteus as a traditional villain, who doesn't care for such notions. The two are not presented as old friends, but simply as acquaintances. Thurio was also rewritten as a harmless, but lovable fool, not unlike Launce and Speed.
