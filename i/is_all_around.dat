5|$|Angelica tasks Chuckie {{to pick a}} {{dandelion}} {{to decorate}} her sculpture. He is unable to obtain it after being chased by a bee and Stu's malfunctioning Mother's Day invention, which is a vacuum-like machine that destroys {{a majority of the}} lawn. After Chuckie breaks her macaroni head, Angelina orders him to stay in the closet along with Tommy, Phil, and Lil. While the babies console Chuckie, he realizes that his dad meets all the requirements of a good mother. They open Chaz's box, finding a spade, a journal of pressed flowers, and a photograph of Chuckie's mother. Meanwhile, Stu's invention continues to vacuum up mud before finally exploding inside the house. Didi is disappointed that Minka did not like the spa, but Minka says she only wanted to spend time with her daughter for Mother's Day. Chuckie gives Chaz the picture of his mother as a Mother's Day present. Chaz decides to talk to Chuckie about his mother, telling him that his mother died of a terminal illness shortly after his birth. He explains that she wrote the diary while she was in the hospital, and reads a poem aloud that she wrote for Chuckie. The mother narrates the poem during a flashback to when she played with Chuckie in the backyard. As they play in the backyard, the episode ends with Chuckie telling his friends that his mother <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>around</b> in him in nature.|$|E
25|$|Many fields {{around the}} village reflect England's history. The field known as 'the Leys' (opposite Milton House in Rectory Lane) shows clear signs of 18th-century pre-enclosure and pre-British Agricultural Revolution farming in strips {{although}} this is slowly disappearing with recent farming. The mediaeval open field system was enclosed in Milton in 1779 together with that of Collingtree. The soil is predominantly sandy {{as one might expect}} since the area is the bed of an ancient river. Evidence of sand and clay extraction <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>around,</b> reflecting 19th- and 20th-century industrial and urban expansion. For example, the small industrial estate in Gayton Road is on an old clay quarry; the playing and football fields in Collingtree Road are on the sites of sand quarries - in the latter case mostly filled with clay spoil from the 1950s construction of the M1. The field between Towcester Road and the A43 Milton by-pass, which opened in May 1991, {{to the west of the}} village was also the site of a sand quarry in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E

500|$|The lyrics {{begin with}} a promise of {{protection}} and caretaking: [...] "You'll be given love / You'll {{be taken care of}} / You'll have to trust it". The song moves towards a more reproachful tone as Björk sings, [...] "You just ain't receiving / Your phone is off the hook / Your doors are shut", tempered by the recognition that you have to [...] "twist your head around you" [...] because [...] "love <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>around</b> you". This is musically effected by Björk's vocals as she sings the lyric [...] "All is full of love" [...] in counterpoint with herself.|$|E

A few Saturdays ago I visited the Biblical Gibeon, and saw the remarkable ancient pool there (I'll take you to see it when you come). It's this pool that's mentioned in II Samuel in connection with Abner ben Ner and Joab ben Zeruiah, who 'met together by the pool of Gibeon' and let 'the young men arise and play before them.'
