Nuclear propulsion, through which high thrust and efficiency can be achieved, is a promising option for decreasing the cost and logistics of such a mission. Work on nuclear thermal engines goes {{back to the days of}} the NERVA program. Currently, nuclear thermal propulsion is under development again in various forms to provide a superior propulsion system for deep space exploration. The authors have been working to develop a concept nuclear thermal engine that uses a <b>grooved</b> <b>ring</b> fuel element as an alternative to the traditional hexagonal rod design. The authors are also studying the use of carbide fuels. The concept was developed in order to increase surface area and heat transfer to the propellant. The use of carbides would also raise the temperature limitations of the reactor. It is hoped that this could lead to a higher thrust to weight nuclear thermal engine. This paper describes the modeling of neutronics, heat transfer, and fluid dynamics of this alternative nuclear fuel element geometry. Fabrication experiments of grooved rings from carbide refractory metals are also presented along with material characterization and interactions with a hot hydrogen environment...|$|E

40|$|In the past, {{fuel rods}} {{have been used}} in nuclear {{propulsion}} applications. A new fuel element concept that reduces weight and increases efficiency uses a stack of grooved discs. Each fuel element is a flat disc with a hole on the interior and grooves across the top. Many <b>grooved</b> <b>ring</b> fuel elements for use in nuclear thermal propulsion systems have been modeled, and a single flow channel for each design has been analyzed. For increased efficiency, a fuel element with a higher surface-area-to-volume ratio is ideal. When grooves are shallower, i. e., they have a lower surface area, the results show that the exit temperature is higher. By coupling the physics of turbulence with those of heat transfer, the effects on the cooler gas flowing through the grooves of the thermally excited solid can be predicted. Parametric studies were done to show how a pressure drop across the axial length of the channels will affect the exit temperatures of the gas. Geometric optimization was done to show the behaviors that result from the manipulation of various parameters. Temperature profiles of the solid and gas showed that more structural optimization is needed to produce the desired results.

40|$|Performance {{characterization}} {{was undertaken}} for an {{air augmented rocket}} mixing duct with annular cavity configurations intended to produce thrust augmentation. Three mixing duct geometries and a fully annular cavity at the exit of the nozzle were tested to enable thrust comparisons. The rocket engine used liquid ethanol and gaseous oxygen, and was instrumented with sensors to output total thrust, mixing duct thrust, combustion chamber pressure, and propellant differential pressures across Venturi flow measurement tubes. The rocket engine was tested to thrust maximum, with three different mixing ducts, three major combustion pressure sets, and a nozzle exit plane annular cavity (a <b>grooved</b> <b>ring).</b> The combustion pressures tested were,, and allowing for a nozzle pressure ratio range of relative to ambient pressure. The mixture ratio was fuel rich throughout all tests. The engine operated very consistently throughout all the tests performed; however, pressure losses in the feed system prevented higher combustion pressures from being tested. Three mixing ducts of the same outer diameter were tested. The short and diverging ducts were the same length and the long duct was long. The short and long ducts created positive mixing duct thrust and the diverging duct created negative mixing duct thrust. The long duct case did show better performance than the no duct case when the total thrust was divided by combustion pressure and nozzle throat area. The long duct always created several times more mixing duct thrust than either the short or diverging ducts, {{but none of the}} mixing ducts created positive overall thrust augmentation in the over expanded cases tested. The mixing duct thrusts ranged between and. As the combustion pressures were increased, getting closer the nozzle’s optimal expansion, the mixing duct thrusts started converging indicating a difference between nozzle operation at over expanded and under expanded. The annular cavity had a noticeable effect on the thrust of the engine and the appearance of the plume. The total thrust of the system was decreased by a maximum of and the plume was more sharply defined when the annular cavity was attached. Better mixing between the primary (engine exhaust) flow and the secondary (ambient air) flow was promoted by the annular cavity because it increased the shear layer’s turbulence and the increased turbulence reduced thrust. The greater mixing also allowed for secondary combustion which made the plumes more sharply defined. The annular cavity was also seen to enhance the mixing duct thrusts for all three mixing ducts...|$|E
40|$|A <b>ring</b> <b>groove</b> {{arrangement}} is proposed to suppress unstable flow or surge in a centrifugal blower. The <b>ring</b> <b>groove</b> arrangement connects the upstream position of impeller inlet and the inducer throat tip through a bypass. The recirculation flow {{was formed by}} the pressure {{difference between the two}} positions, and the recirculation flow rate was changed by increasing the <b>ring</b> <b>groove</b> widths. The inlet recirculation results in a decrease in the flow rate of unstable flow inception, and an up to 8 % improvement in stall limit was obtained by the <b>ring</b> <b>groove</b> arrangement at a small expense of the delivery pressure drop. The improvement of stall limit in the present experiment seems to be mainly due to decrease in flow incidence based on the inlet recirculation flow.
