40|$|The author uses {{a spatial}} econometric {{framework}} {{to examine the}} determinants of teacher salaries in the United States, including union activity in the teachers’ own and in neighboring districts, teacher salaries in nearby districts, and other school district characteristics such as size and student-teacher ratios.

Results also confirm that salaries for experienced and beginning teachers are positively affected by the salaries of teachers in nearby districts.

5000|$|The commissaires {{originated}} in Paris as the 48 commissaires enquêteurs-examinateurs of the Grand Châtelet.Long before 1667, they {{had served as}} all-purpose agents of the Châtelet in the various quarters of Paris. But by choice and economic compulsion, they had increasingly forsaken their role of watchdogs of public security and had become somewhat discredited fee-grabbers, mainly concerned with such matters as imposing seals on {{the property of the}} deceased, taking legal inventories, serving summonses, and imposing a wide variety offines on which they collected a lucrative percentage.The first Lieutenant General of Police of Paris, Gabriel Nicolas de la Reynie, tried to reform the commissaires, persuading the king to <b>increase</b> <b>salaries</b> and retirement benefits and restore honors formerly attached to the office in the hopes of weaning them off the corrupting system of fees, but it was [...] "a losing battle. In 1699 the old fee system wasrestored in the manner long demanded by the commissaires."Whatever the shortcomings of the forty-eight commissaires, they remained the backbone of public order in Paris. Several kinds of armed, uniformed patrolmen theoretically circulated around the streets of Paris ... but in time of trouble the commissaire's house (practically all seventeenth-century officials did their work from their residences) loomed as large as Gibraltar. Ordinarily, a criminal case began with someone knocking {{on the door of the}} nearest commissaire and lodging a complaint against a fellow citizen. The commissaire's address was well known to residents of his quartier, and he was supposed to be available day and night to hear grievances and settle disputes. ... Each commissaire was assigned several sergents or huissiers to assist him in carrying out his civil duties — the only duties most commissaires really cared about, since they carried the most lucrative fees.In the mid-eighteenth century, the commissaires [...] "generally enjoyed the confidence of the people." [...] Each of them was based in a particular area of the city and thus knew and was known to the local citizens; they were generally [...] "well educated, usually with legal training, and their job was not only to keep order but also to protect public health and safety... The commissaires also played an important role as local notables. They convened meetings of inhabitants to elect people to look after the streetlights. They responded to public complaints about antisocial behavior..." [...] They [...] "returned to their owners goods that had been pawned at usurious rates of interest" [...] and witnessed statements and complaints. [...] "All of these matters gave the commissaire a very particular relationship with the public. He was, in a sense, at their service." ...|$|E
5000|$|As liberal leaders Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang {{guided the}} country through {{economic}} reforms, conservative leaders pushed back with a Campaign against [...] "Spiritual Pollution" [...] in 1983. Paramount leader Deng Xiaoping sided with the reformers and ended that campaign. By 1986, newspaper editorials began calling for political reform and university students organized democracy salons. Liberal physicist Fang Lizhi toured campuses, advocating democratic reforms and the independence of universities from the government. In December 1986, student protests in Hefei spread to Beijing, where students marched around campuses in the university district northwest of the city, calling for direct election of political representatives, {{freedom of the press}} and release of political prisoners. On January 1 and 2, 1987, several hundred students attempted to march on Tiananmen Square in defiance of orders of the city government. The protests attracted little public attention but party conservatives reacted with fury at Hu Yaobang for his [...] "weak" [...] response to [...] "bourgeois liberalism". Hu Yaobang was forced to resign on January 17 and Fang Lizhi was expelled from the Communist Party. Zhao Ziyang succeeded Hu as Party General Secretary and Li Peng became Premier.When Hu Yaobang died suddenly on April 15, 1989, university students laid wreaths at the Monument to the People's Heroes and organized sit-ins outside the Great Hall of the People and Zhongnanhai. They demanded the Party rescind past criticism of Hu, renounce the campaigns against spiritual pollution and bourgeois liberalism, disclose the assets of the family members of party officials, lift orders against public assembly, permit freedom of the press, and <b>increase</b> <b>salaries</b> for university graduates. On the night of April 21, 100,000 students marched into Tiananmen Square to attend Hu's funeral, which was held inside the Great Hall of the People the following day. Officials inside the Hall did not meet with students in the Square, who began to boycott classes. Workers formed an independent union and joined the protests. On April 23, as Zhao Ziyang was departing for a trip to North Korea, he told Li Peng to restore normalcy, avoid worsening tensions with students and refrain from using force, except against those who commit offenses against life and property.On April 24, {{at a meeting of the}} politburo chaired by Li Peng, Beijing Party Secretary Li Ximing and Mayor Chen Xitong said the student demonstrations were manipulated by plotters seeking to overthrow the party-state and had to be halted. The following day, Deng Xiaoping, after hearing reports from Premier Li Peng and President Yang Shangkun, called the demonstrations a [...] "disturbance" [...] that was to be halted through coercive measures. Deng's characterization was published in the People's Daily editorial of April 26. The students felt maligned by the editorial and 100,000 from more than 40 universities marched to the city center, past Tiananmen Square to the Lama Temple, breaking through police blockades along the way.|$|E
