50|$|Some {{quarries}} used primitive {{top hammer}} machines {{that carried the}} jack hammer on a mast - the slenderness of the <b>drill</b> <b>rods</b> working with a relatively large diameter drill bit caused bore holes to deviate which sometimes meant that a bore hole might finish dangerously close to its neighbour or indeed {{be closer to the}} face of the quarry than had been intended.

Moreover, the rotary sealing device with high pressure is designed to achieve the axial and rotation movement simultaneously as well as good sealing effect under high-pressure water jet.

Since the tunnel dropped slightly from north to south, water had to be collected from the northern section and laboriously pumped by hand out of the tunnel.|$|E
50|$|Most {{drill holes}} deviate {{slightly}} from their planned trajectory. This {{is because of}} the torque of the turning bit working against the cutting face, because of the flexibility of the steel rods and especially the screw joints, because of reaction to foliation and structure within the rock, and because of refraction as the bit moves into different rock layers of varying resistance. Additionally, inclined holes will tend to deviate upwards because the <b>drill</b> <b>rods</b> will lie against the bottom of the bore, causing the drill bit to be slightly inclined from true. It is because of deviation that drill holes must be surveyed if deviation will impact the usefulness of the information returned. Sometimes the surface location can be offset laterally {{to take advantage of the}} expected deviation tendency, so the bottom of the hole will end up near the desired location. Oil well drilling commonly uses a process of controlled deviation called directional drilling (e.g., when several wells are drilled from one surface location).|$|E
5000|$|Also {{known as}} {{ballistic}} well drilling and sometimes called [...] "spudders", these rigs raise and drop a drill string {{with a heavy}} carbide tipped drilling bit that chisels through the rock by finely pulverizing the subsurface materials. The drill string is composed of the upper <b>drill</b> <b>rods,</b> a set of [...] "jars" [...] (inter-locking [...] "sliders" [...] that help transmit additional energy to the drill bit and assist in removing the bit if it is stuck) and the drill bit. During the drilling process, the drill string is periodically removed from the borehole and a bailer is lowered to collect the drill cuttings (rock fragments, soil, etc.). The bailer is a bucket-like tool with a trapdoor in the base. If the borehole is dry, water is added so that the drill cuttings will flow into the bailer. When lifted, the trapdoor closes and the cuttings are then raised and removed. Since the drill string must be raised and lowered to advance the boring, the casing (larger diameter outer piping) is typically used to hold back upper soil materials and stabilize the borehole.|$|E

The diamonds used to make diamond core bits are a variety of sizes, fine to microfine industrial grade diamonds, and the ratio of diamonds to metal used in the matrix affects the performance of the bits cutting ability in different types of rock formations [...] The diamonds are set within a matrix of varying hardness, from brass to high-grade steel. Matrix hardness, diamond size and dosing can be varied according to the rock which must be cut. The bits made with hard steel with a low diamond count are ideal for softer highly fractured rock while others made of softer steels and high diamond ratio are good for coring in hard solid rock. Holes within the bit allow water to be delivered to the cutting face. This provides three essential functions — lubrication, cooling, and removal of drill cuttings from the hole.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to follow up {{blasting}} at the development work of drifts by measuring the distance from a fixed point to the faces before and after scaling and then analyzes the data. LKAB Malmberget needs to follow up the blasting to improve and make the development of drifts more effective. The goals of the project have been to investigate if {{the length of the}} <b>drill</b> <b>rods,</b> drilling plan or the placement of faces affects the need for scaling. The work has involved a literature review of tunneling and its processes, a five-week field study at the development of drifts in LKAB Malmberget where the collection of data was done, analysis, comparing and finally documenting in report form. Development {{is the first step in}} the extraction of ore. Development involves the building of new fields and transport routes in the mine where the ore can be mined and transported. There are two types of drifts in the ore bodies, main gallery and cross cut. It is in the cross cuts the large-scale sub-level caving takes place, which LKAB is known for. At the development work, LKAB Malmberget is using the conventional cycle of blasting which includes drilling, charging, blasting, ventilation, excavation, scaling and reinforcement. At the drilling of the drifts there are three drilling rigs with two different lengths of the <b>drill</b> <b>rods,</b> 16 and 18 feet. In the western field, a rig with 18 foot rod is used and the eastern field has two rigs with both 16 and 18 foot. There are also two different types of drilling plans with different numbers of holes. The drilling plan with 76 holes is used on the western field and the drilling plan on the eastern field has fewer holes. The results of the project show that the need for scaling is greatest when using the 18 foot <b>drill</b> <b>rods,</b> which can be caused by abnormalities of the drill holes or a failed blasting where the rock was not thrown out in the drift. Since the drill holes are longer when using 18 foot <b>drill</b> <b>rods</b> there are also possible that air pockets are formed during the charging in the explosives which can result in an uneven and weak detonation. Further the results show that the need of scaling increases when the face is placed in ore which may be caused by the density. The ore has a higher density than waste rock which makes it harder to blast in ore. The difference in distance before and after scaling is more even for faces placed in ore, which may its base in the formation of a slice of ore closest to the face which is released more even then waste rock does under the scaling process. The drilling plan has no significant effect on the needed scaling because there is only a few holes difference in the drilling plans on the eastern and western field which otherwise is equal. If the dimensions of the profile may vary, there can be an effect on the need for scaling. Validerat; 20110928 (anonymous...|$|E

Drilling and planetary soil/rock sample acquisition provides information about history of past events, minerals and chemical composition of the soil/rock of the planetary body, available resources for future manned missions and the mechanical behavior of the planetary soil/rock. Several types of drilling devices have been proposed for lunar, Mars, and planetary subsurface exploration. However, these devices have limitations (e. g. heavy equipment and need for large axial force) {{that need to be}} addressed in order to be feasible for extraterrestrial bodies’ exploration. A special type of ultrasonic percussive drill have been proposed by Honeybee Spacecraft Mechanisms Corporation and NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to address the limitations of current drilling devices. In this study, the mechanical system of the ultrasonic percussive drill and its interaction with the supporting medium is studied. The percussive mechanism consists of an ultrasonic horn, a free mass, and the <b>drill</b> <b>rod.</b> Special attention is given to the impact between the free mass and the <b>drill</b> <b>rod,</b> including the effects of structural damping, the supporting medium of the rod, plastic deformation in the contact area, and repeated impacts of the free mass on the <b>drill</b> <b>rod.</b> A general methodology to analyze the impact of the free mass on the <b>drill</b> <b>rod,</b> analogous to the longitudinal impact of a mass on a rod, is developed. The methodology involves uncoupling the nonlinear problem by determining the response of each body independently under the contact force to find the local indentation, then using Hertz force-indentation relation to find the contact force. This method is applied using mode superposition method and finite element technique for various support conditions of the rod (e. g. rigid, elastic, free, viscoelastic). Additionally, a model to account for <b>drill</b> <b>rod</b> penetration into the supporting medium due to impact of the free mass is also presented. It was found that for an undamped rod, the support condition of the rod does not affect the contact force if the contact ends before the arrival of the reflected wave to the point of contact. It was also observed that the contact force due to impact, for a given support condition, increases with increasing damping of the rod. Moreover, a modified Hertz equation is introduced to include plastic deformation on the rod due to impact of the free mass. The study was performed for identical repetitive impacts and it was found that the largest plastic deformation occurs in the first impact, with additional plastic deformation decreasing with the increasing number of impacts. The dynamic response of the overall percussive drill was investigated with a finite element model, including the interaction of the free mass with the ultrasonic horn and the <b>drill</b> <b>rod.</b> A numerical example indicated that the dynamic response of the ultrasonic drill is directly affected by the supporting medium.

To modify air reverse circulation drilling technology according to the conditions of a specific glacier, original cutter drill bits and air processing devices (air-cooled aftercoolers, air receivers, coalescing filters, desiccant dryers) should be used.
