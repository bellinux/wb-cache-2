500|$|Feige {{stated that}} Steve Rogers would be paired with other {{characters}} from The Avengers like Black Widow and Nick Fury, because unlike Tony Stark and Thor, who {{could return to}} their own supporting casts, Rogers had nowhere else to go, [...] "and it just made sense {{that he was the}} one that stayed with what remains of the Avengers at the end of the film." [...] The writers considered including Hawkeye, but [...] "he didn't have enough to do and suddenly it seemed like we were giving him short shrift", leading all of his parts to be fulfilled by Black Widow, and Joe Russo added that Jeremy Renner's schedule could not be worked out for him to appear. As to why the Red Skull from The First Avenger did not appear in The Winter Soldier, Joe Russo explained, [...] "I know we have a guy in a computer, but the tone we were chasing was sort of that conspiracy thriller. And we wanted to try and ground the movie as much as we could. And Red Skull, he's a fantastical character and didn't necessarily fit for Cap 2 and especially because it was about the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D. Certainly Hydra exists and that's his legacy, but there's something <b>interesting</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> fact that his legacy outlived the skull. And they're still dealing with the demons of it, but not necessarily him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Less {{impressed}} was GameSpot's Ron Dulin, {{who scored}} the game 6 out of 10, calling it [...] "an interesting mood piece, built upon some very detailed graphic work and an interesting premise – but {{somewhere along the}} production line, someone forgot to include a game." [...] He was critical of the random nature of the game, especially the multiple endings; [...] "To justify the number of wildly different endings, the designers have tried to keep some elements of the story very vague {{for the bulk of}} the story. But even with these safeguards, there are always a number of confusing contradictions and loose ends no matter how the story winds up." [...] He concluded, [...] "most of what's <b>interesting</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> game is exactly what was <b>interesting</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> film, and not much was done to extend the concepts or explore them any further. Fans of the film will undoubtedly overlook the game's flaws and enjoy living the life of the Blade Runner, even if it only lasts a few hours. But those who are awaiting the next generation of adventure games are advised to keep waiting." ...|$|E

According to Brian Dunning, [...] "because this service requires a security clearance, their newsletter is protected as well. There is nothing especially <b>interesting</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> actual article; it's just a dramatized retelling of the same information in Col.

2500|$|The San Francisco Chronicles Peter Hartlaub {{felt the}} remake {{departed}} from the traditional template used by more recent remakes—"include twice as many kills, [...] boring young actors from TV shows, rewrite the script so you lose everything <b>interesting</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> original, [...] make up an excuse to add cell phones"—which ultimately made it far more effective. Hartlaub cited the script, which he felt devoted as much time to character development as [...] "carnage", and the [...] "good acting", particularly Tony Goldwyn, as reasons why this remake succeeds. Kyle Smith, of the New York Post, agreed that the film succeeded where other remakes had failed. For Smith, it was {{the replacement of the}} [...] "quick-cutting, loud noises and camera tricks" [...] clichés with [...] "long takes, genuinely disturbing violence and stretches with no dialogue to pin you to the story", which made this film more effective. Smith also commended Dillahunt's acting, as well as Iliadis's [...] "casual, matter-of-fact approach that multiplies the horror to an almost unbearable level". In contrast, USA Today's Claudia Puig stated that director Dennis Iliadis failed at trying to keep the film from becoming another [...] "torture porn". Puig felt that the killing scenes were too drawn out, noting the technique was down to heighten the effect, but actually comes across more as [...] "repugnant and fetishized violence". She also noted that the parents seemed to find enjoyment in exacting their revenge, even when their daughter lay dying in the next room. Joe Neumaier of the New York Daily News was in agreement with Puig when he referred to the film as [...] "stomach-churningly anti-human" [...] because of its violence, and questioned why Goldwyn and Potter even signed on to the film. Neumaier suggests that the film's violence fails to create the sense of [...] "theatricality of the Saw or Hostel films", or even provide audiences with [...] "the unkillable-monster nostalgia of [...] Friday the 13th re-do". Neumaier also states that the 2009 film lacks the reasoning to exist that Craven's 1972 original had, which was to push the [...] "boundaries of cinema's new permissiveness".|$|E

60|$|In {{the chamber}} where the mate lay, {{there were seven}} beds, all of them {{occupied}} by persons who had met with accidents. In {{the centre of the}} room was a stationary pine table, about the length of a man, intended, I suppose, to stretch patients upon for necessary operations. The furniture of the beds was plain and homely. I thought that the faces of the patients all looked remarkably intelligent, though they were evidently men of the lower classes. Suffering had educated them morally and intellectually. They gazed curiously at Mr. Wilding and me, but nobody said a word. In the bed next to the mate lay a little boy with a broken thigh. The surgeon observed that children generally did well with accidents; and this boy certainly looked very bright and cheerful. There was nothing particularly <b>interesting</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> mate.|$|E
