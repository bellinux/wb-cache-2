25|$|Venture capital (VC) {{is a type}} {{of private}} equity, a form of {{financing}} that is provided by <b>firms</b> <b>or</b> funds to small, early-stage, emerging firms that are deemed to have high growth potential, or which have demonstrated high growth (in terms of number of employees, annual revenue, or both). Venture capital <b>firms</b> <b>or</b> funds invest in these early-stage companies in exchange for equity, or an ownership stake, in the companies they invest in. Venture capitalists take on the risk of financing risky start-ups in the hopes that some of the firms they support will become successful. The start-ups are usually based on an innovative technology or business model and they are usually from the high technology industries, such as information technology (IT), clean technology or biotechnology.|$|E

25|$|In this theory, {{sovereign}} {{government is}} not financially constrained {{in its ability to}} spend; it is argued that the government can afford to buy anything that is for sale in currency that it issues (there may be political constraints, like a debt ceiling law).

25|$|A {{secondary}} buyout {{is a form}} of {{leveraged buyout}} where both the buyer and the seller are private equity <b>firms</b> <b>or</b> financial sponsors (i.e., a leveraged buyout of a company that was acquired through a leveraged buyout). A secondary buyout will often provide a clean break for the selling private equity firms and its limited partner investors. Historically, given that secondary buyouts were perceived as distressed sales by both seller and buyer, limited partner investors considered them unattractive and largely avoided them.|$|E
25|$|Discrete choice models {{theoretically}} or empirically model choices made {{by people}} among a finite set of alternatives. The models {{have been used to}} examine, e.g., the choice of which car to buy, where to go to college, which mode of transport (car, bus, rail) to take to work among numerous other applications. Discrete choice models are also used to examine choices by organizations, such as <b>firms</b> <b>or</b> government agencies. In the discussion below, the decision-making unit is assumed to be a person, though the concepts are applicable more generally. Daniel McFadden won the Nobel prize in 2000 for his pioneering work in developing the theoretical basis for discrete choice.|$|E

25|$|An {{article was}} {{published}} by the Expresso dated 2004 which listed the most desirable graduates of universities and polytechnics by Portuguese companies {{in the fields of}} engineering, structural engineering, marketing, management, economics and finance. This non-scientific report used a survey made by some human resources recruiting firms, which means that the population surveyed comprised only the candidates who were seeking a job through those recruiting firms, and excluded the highly qualified candidates who were recruited directly by the companies, by other important recruiting <b>firms,</b> <b>or</b> were recruited by headhunters before graduation. Additionally, some graduates are recruited from local higher learning institutions through partnerships with local companies or other institutions, bypassing full and open competition.|$|E
25|$|At {{an annual}} food safety {{exhibition}} in Tokyo held on 26 to 28 October 2011, machines were shown that could measure radiation: on conveyor belts {{food and other}} objects could be proofed by a radiation sensor, and the outcome could be read within 12 seconds. In this way {{a large number of}} objects could be checked in a very short time. Despite the huge price: 56,000 dollars, farmers, beef processors and restaurant chains showed great interest. Smaller devices to check food for radioactivity were shown, testing food placed in beakers. These could be used by smaller <b>firms</b> <b>or</b> even in households. The lowest cost of these small machines was still around 9,000 dollars.|$|E
25|$|A 1997 report {{prepared}} by Oxfam America and the Washington Office on Latin America, Myths And Facts About The U.S. Embargo On Medicine And Medical Supplies, {{concluded that the}} embargo forced Cuba to use more of its limited resources on medical imports, both because equipment and drugs from foreign subsidiaries of U.S. <b>firms</b> <b>or</b> from non-U.S.sources tend to be higher priced and because shipping costs are greater. The Democracy Act of 1992 further exacerbated the problems in Cuba's medical system. It prohibited foreign subsidiaries of U.S. corporations from selling to Cuba, thus further limiting Cuba's access to medicine and equipment, and raising prices. In addition, the act forbids ships that dock in Cuban ports from docking in U.S. ports for six months. This drastically restricts shipping, and increases shipping costs some 30%.|$|E

This means that there exist some cases where using only the monetary compensation {{turns out to be}} more efficient rather than using the promotion chance as an incentive for the employees.

25|$|Local {{community}} displacement : Gift {{shops and}} cafés which cater {{for the needs}} of tourists are often more profitable than shops selling everyday goods for local people (such as butchers or bakers). In some villages where tourist shops are in the majority and there are few shops catering for the local people, the local community may feel pushed out by the tourists. Houses are often very expensive in tourist villages as there is demand for them as second homes or holiday homes by holiday cottage <b>firms</b> <b>or</b> well-off people who live elsewhere, or who move to a local home from which they commute to work, making them unaffordable for local people. This is a particular problem in areas within easy commuting distance of large cities, such as the Peak District, the Lake District, the Yorkshire Dales, and the New Forest and South Downs.|$|E
25|$|Gwalior is {{surrounded}} by 3 Industrial areas – Sitholi, Banmore and Malanpur. All three of these sectors are on NH 75, NH-3 and NH 92 respectively, with Malanpur being the largest. The city used to have big manufacturing industries, such as Gwalior Grasim and J.C. MILLS of Birlanagar, but now this sector is left with only one major factory – J.B.Mangharam Ltd. But the other 3 sectors have many industries. The important ones are from dairy, chemical, manufacturing, textiles, and other industries. Handicraft and small industries are also found like Gwalior potteries. Gwalior {{is also an important}} historical and tourism sector of the country. Therefore, the tourism sector also puts an effect into the city's economy. Gwalior is part of NCR. The Gwalior Trade Fair is an annual trade fair showcasing the economy of Gwalior. There are some manufacturing set-ups of some companies like UFlex (Flex Industries Ltd), SRF, Ranbaxy Laboratories, Cadbury, J. K. Tyres, Surya Bulbs, SiyaRam and Railway spring factory Sitholi.' Most of the Local population is involved with trading <b>firms</b> <b>or</b> are self-employed. Many run OMEs and SMEs with Gwalior and Agra as the local market.
