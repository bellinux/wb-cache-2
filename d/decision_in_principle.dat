40|$|Background: an anticipatory {{decision}} document records a person's wishes regarding {{medical treatment}} {{at a time}} when they have capacity to make choices, to be enacted when this capacity is lost. In England and Wales an advance decision to refuse treatment (ADRT, or advance decision), a legally binding document, is currently rarely used. A disparity is suggested to exist between physicians' support for anticipatory <b>decisions</b> <b>in</b> <b>principle</b> and their lack of impact on decision-making in practice. Objective: to elicit geriatricians' views on advance decisions and their use in decision-making in England. Design: a qualitative approach was taken. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 10 geriatricians. An inductive approach was used for data analysis. Results: geriatricians held positive views on anticipatory <b>decisions</b> <b>in</b> <b>principle.</b> <b>In</b> practice, they reported being highly likely to follow a <b>decision</b> which was <b>in</b> line with their clinical view. They would also favour an ADRT which was prescriptive in terms of the situation and treatment to which it applied. However, geriatricians expressed concerns in relation to patient understanding of the role and limits of these documents. Participants expressed discomfort in following an ADRT which, in their professional opinion, did not represent the patient's best interests, despite it being a legally binding document. A conflict between doctors' beneficence and patients' autonomy was apparent, with geriatricians differing in their views on how ADRTs should fit into medical decision-making; particularly how far anticipatory decisions can represent ongoing patient autonomy. Conclusion: despite their status in law, an ADRT which conflicts with a geriatrician's clinical opinion may not be implemented, in breach of the Mental Capacity Act. To avoid this, they must be seated within wider advance care planning. © The Author 2011. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the British Geriatrics Society...|$|R

40|$|A visual {{interactive}} {{decision support}} framework designed {{to aid the}} decision-maker, typically top management, in selecting the most appropriate technology and design when planning a flexible manufacturing system (FMS) is described. The framework {{can be used in}} the preinvestment stage of the planning process, after the <b>decision</b> <b>in</b> <b>principle</b> has been made to build an FMS. First, both qualitative and quantitative criteria are used to narrow the set of alternative system configurations under consideration down to a small number of most attractive candidates. After this prescreening phase, a multiobjective programming model is formulated for each remaining configuration, allowing the manager to explore and evaluate {{the costs and benefits of}} various different scenarios for each configuration separately by experimenting with different levels of batch sizes and production volumes. The system uses visual interaction with the decision-maker, graphically displaying the relevant trade-offs between such relevant performance criteria as investment and production costs, manufacturing flexibility, production volume and investment risk, for each scenario. Additional criteria, when relevant, can also be included. The ease of use and interpretation and the flexibility make the proposed system a powerful analytical tool in the initial FMS design process. The insights gained from experimenting with the different scenarios form the basis of understanding the anticipated impact of techno-economic factors on the performance of the FMS configuration, and provide valuable information for the implementation stage of building the FMS.

But to complete the analogy it will also be necessary to answer the question of why do we want to go there. The legislative mandate to use Xmsy as the target stock in single species management has pushed that question aside. Given the non-comparability of the benefits from the use of the outputs of multiple stocks, it will be necessary to go beyond the concept of the maximization of sustainable biomass yield as a measure of benefits in order to design an EBFM system that will allow for the answer to the expanded set of question in an internally consistent manner.

40|$|Abstract. Classifier {{decision}} fusion {{has been}} shown to act in a manner analogous to the back-projection of Radon transformations when individual classifier feature sets are non or partially overlapping. It is possible, via this analogy, to demonstrate that standard linear classifier fusion introduces a morphological bias into the decision space due to the implicit angular undersampling of the feature selection process. In standard image-based (eg medical) tomography, removal of this bias involves a filtration process, and an analogous n-dimensional processes can be shown to exist for decision fusion using Högbom deconvolution. Countering the biasing process implicit in linear fusion, however, is the fact that back projection of Radon transformation (being additive) should act to reduce variance within the composite <b>decision</b> space. <b>In</b> <b>principle,</b> this additive variance-reduction should still apply to tomographicallyfiltered back-projection, unless the filtration process contravenes. We therefore argue that when feature selection is carried-out independently for each classifier (as in e. g. multi-modal problems) unfiltered <b>decision</b> fusion, while <b>in</b> general being variance-decreasing, is typically also bias-increasing. By employing a shot noise model, we seek to quantify how far filtration acts to rectify this problem, such that feature selection can be made both bias and variance reducing within an ensemble fusion context. ...|$|R
