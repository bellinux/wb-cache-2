25|$|The sandals {{retained}} substantially {{their original}} form until the tenth century. Then straps {{were replaced by}} three or five tongues reaching to the ankle, extensions of the upper leather upon {{the point of the}} foot, and these were fastened at ankle by means of a string. In the twelfth century these tongues were gradually shortened; in the thirteenth century, the sandal was a regular shoe with a slit above the foot or on the side to make the putting-on easier. In the sixteenth century there was a return to the earlier form of the sandal; instead of a <b>high</b> <b>shoe</b> it now became once more a low foot-covering, like a slipper, a form which it has retained until the present time. The material of which the pontifical sandals are made was, until the thirteenth century, exclusively leather, at times covered with silk. Since the later Middle Ages, {{the upper part of the}} sandals has been made, not of leather, but of silk, velvet, etc. It is not until about 1400, with the exception of entirely isolated earlier examples, that a cross is to be found upon the sandals. The fork-shaped decoration, frequently found on pontifical shoes, especially on those of the thirteenth century, was not a cross, but merely an ornament.|$|E

After then, we want to monitori the impact of walking in these shoes on the trajectory of pelvis motion. Methods Objectification method was 3 D record of human gait (= kinematic analysis), which was performed using the Qualisys Track Manager. In our thesis we used the method of comparison. The aim of the study is the comparison of parameters measured in different types of <b>shoes</b> (<b>high</b> heeled <b>shoes,</b> <b>high</b> heeled less <b>shoes</b> with barefoot gait) and the influence on pelvis motion in the sagittal plane. Measurements were carried out in the gym at the Faculty of Physical Education and Sport at ten probands. Results Pelvis tilt to retroversion was more significant when walking on heel less <b>shoes</b> compared with <b>high</b> heel <b>shoes</b> and barefooted walking, also an angle of the trunk and pelvis were most significantly diminished when walking on heel less shoes compared to barefooted walking and <b>high</b> heel <b>shoes.</b> Objectively, a larger deflection of pelvis trajectory while walking on <b>high</b> heel <b>shoes</b> was not confirmed compared to walking on heel less [...] ...|$|R

50|$|Not {{all high}} slim heels merit the {{description}} stiletto. The extremely slender original Italian-style stiletto {{heels of the}} late 1950s and very early 1960s {{were no more than}} 5 mm in diameter for much of their length, although the heel sometimes flared out a little at the top-piece (tip). After their demise in the mid-late 1960s, such slender heels were difficult to find until recently due to changes in the way heels were mass-produced. A real stiletto heel has a stem of solid steel or alloy. The more usual method of mass-producing <b>high</b> <b>shoe</b> heels, i.e. moulded plastic with an internal metal tube for reinforcement, does not achieve the true stiletto shape.|$|E

In addition to Coriano (which {{at that time}} was only a fortified village), the supplies also included Montecolombo, Montescudo and Croce.Insufficient documents on the construction of the castle, but {{can be traced back to}} 1300, and the first renovations to 1144 (when Sigismondo Malatesta took care of the work in other rocks of Rimini). The first description we have is from 1504 and, in this case, the administrator Malipiero: [...] "Castle 8 miles away from Arimino, circundato by a wall switch 7 Cumulative <b>high</b> <b>shoe,</b> and coridor top 5 foot, turn 194 passes.

After the war, in parallel to the abandonment of the population that moved to the coast, the castle was left in an advanced state of decay.After a few urban interventions inappropriate in recent decades has taken place for rehabilitation and restoration of the fortress under the auspices of the Superintendency and the Fine Arts, the building making a positive recovery.

40|$|The goal on this {{investigation}} {{was to develop a}} detachable <b>high</b> heel <b>shoe</b> construction that could enter the current high heel market. The impact of <b>high</b> heel <b>shoes</b> on women's fashion is enormous but there are associated issues of comfort and health with these shoes. This work aims to maintain the appealing aspects of a <b>high</b> heel <b>shoe</b> while adding a concealed mechanism to enable the heel to be easily removed to convert the shoe into a flat at the discretion of the user. The current solutions and products in the nearly 7 billion dollar a year women's shoe market are minimal. The prior arts of detachable heels fail to develop a simple comprehensive detachable high heel that can enter the market. A feasible and complete design that takes into account arch stiffness, heel removal, styling, and manufacturability is the goal of this work. This investigation deconstructed <b>high</b> heel <b>shoes</b> to learn and leverage the current <b>high</b> heel <b>shoe</b> infrastructure as a basis for adapting the shoe into a detachable <b>high</b> heel <b>shoe</b> construction. Three prototypes of the detachable <b>high</b> heel <b>shoe</b> were developed with a shoe assembly that consisted of a modified insole and a detachable heel that consisted of a dovetailed aluminum shank fastened to a high heel. (cont.) The prototypes were able to display the ability for the detachable high heel to maintain high heel stability, styling that is consistent with the industry, ease of use, a flat shoe and other critical functional requirements identified in the work. The construction was consistent with the current industry high heel infrastructure. The development of the detachable high heel construction displays the feasibility of such a product in a market where none exist. The detachable high heel construction needs further refinement and optimization to complete a design that is ready to enter this exciting market. by Alfredo Louis Morales. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|Foot {{health is}} very {{important}} for women. Previous studies have demonstrated that the wearing of <b>high</b> heeled <b>shoes</b> could create <b>high</b> forefoot pressure and cause many foot problems. Metatarsal pads are often used in plantar pressure relief. Therefore, the effects of several different metatarsal pads for <b>high</b> heeled <b>shoes</b> are investigated in this study. There are three tested materials, including bio-gel, polyurethane and EVA. Forefoot pressure, heel pressure, and comfort level are recorded and analyzed. The results show that the insertions of all types of metatarsal pads reduce forefoot peak pressure and increase heel peak pressure during walking. Polyurethane is the most efficient material, which relieves the forefoot peak pressure by 35. 54 % compared to circumstances without the padding. In addition, the subjective comfort level is significantly improved when the bio-gel pad is applied.
