5|$|The {{origin of}} the Sardinian ichnusae {{subspecies}} is uncertain, as it is absent from Pleistocene deposits <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>current</b> homeland. It is possible it originated during the Neolithic following its introduction to the island by humans. It is likely then that Sardinian fox populations stem from repeated introductions of animals from different localities in the Mediterranean. This latter theory may explain the subspecies' phenotypic diversity.|$|E
5|$|Artillery and {{long-range}} {{machine gun}} fire continued to riddle the wrecks and the combined crews {{were ordered to}} evacuate as the officers set the scuttling charges which would sink the blockships <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>current,</b> useless locations. As men scrambled {{down the side of}} the cruisers into Coastal Motor Boats which would relay them to the Offshore Squadron, destroyers moved closer to Ostend to cover the retreat and the monitors continued their heavy fire. Godsal was the last to leave, picked up by launch ML276 commanded by Lieutenant Rowley Bourke. With the main assault a complete failure, the blockading forces returned to Dover and Dunkirk to assess the disaster.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the atoms}} {{that make up}} the Earth and its {{inhabitants}} were present <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>current</b> form in the nebula that collapsed out of a molecular cloud to form the Solar System. The rest are the result of radioactive decay, and their relative proportion can be used to determine the age of the Earth through radiometric dating. Most of the helium in the crust of the Earth (about 99% of the helium from gas wells, as shown by its lower abundance of helium-3) is a product of alpha decay.|$|E
5|$|Proposed in {{the form}} of an interstate compact, the {{agreement}} would go into effect among the participating states in the compact only after they collectively represent an absolute majority of votes (currently at least 270) in the Electoral College. In the next presidential election after adoption by the requisite number of states, the participating states would award all of their electoral votes to presidential electors associated with the candidate who wins the overall popular vote in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. As a result, the winner of the national popular vote would always win the presidency by always securing a majority of votes in the Electoral College. Until the compact's conditions are met, all states award electoral votes <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>current</b> manner.|$|E

5|$|When the {{terrestrial}} planets were forming, they remained {{immersed in a}} disk of gas and dust. The gas was partially supported by pressure and so did not orbit the Sun as rapidly as the planets. The resulting drag and, more importantly, gravitational interactions with the surrounding material caused a transfer of angular momentum, {{and as a result}} the planets gradually migrated to new orbits. Models show that density and temperature variations in the disk governed this rate of migration, but the net trend was for the inner planets to migrate inward as the disk dissipated, leaving the planets <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>current</b> orbits.|$|E
5|$|By {{executive}} order, Bevin required {{all state}} agencies to reduce spending <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>current</b> budgets by 4.5 percent. House Speaker Greg Stumbo argued that Bevin {{did not have}} the authority to order such reductions without legislative approval, but Senate President Robert Stivers defended Bevin's action, saying it amounted to simply not spending money that was previously allocated. Bevin later compromised with the state's public college and university presidents to reduce the cuts to 2 percent, but Attorney General Andy Beshear sued to stop the cuts entirely. On May 18, 2016, a Franklin Circuit Court judge ruled Bevin did have the authority to make the cuts. The Kentucky Supreme Court accepted the case on appeal, granting Beshear's request to bypass the Kentucky Court of Appeals for expediency. A hearing before the Supreme Court occurred on August 18. On September 21, 2016, the Supreme Court issued a 5–2 decision reversing the Franklin Circuit Court ruling and agreeing with Beshear that Bevin {{did not have the}} authority to make mid-year budget cuts without the approval of the General Assembly.|$|E

5|$|In autumn 1940, {{high-ranking}} German officials {{drafted a}} memorandum {{on the dangers}} of an invasion of the Soviet Union. They said Ukraine, Belorussia and the Baltic States would end up as only a further economic burden for Germany. It was argued that the Soviets <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>current</b> bureaucratic form were harmless and that the occupation would not benefit Germany. Hitler disagreed with economists about the risks and told his right-hand man Hermann Göring, the chief of the Luftwaffe, that he would no longer listen to misgivings about the economic dangers of a war with Russia. It is speculated that this was passed on to General Georg Thomas, who had produced reports that predicted a net economic drain for Germany {{in the event of an}} invasion of the Soviet Union unless its economy was captured intact and the Caucasus oilfields seized in the first blow, and he consequently revised his future report to fit Hitler's wishes. The Red Army's ineptitude in the Winter War against Finland in 1939–40 convinced Hitler of a quick victory within a few months. Neither Hitler nor the General Staff anticipated a long campaign lasting into the winter, and therefore adequate preparations, such as the distribution of warm clothing and winterization of vehicles and lubricants, were not made.|$|E
5|$|Heading into Bound for Glory IV, TNA {{created a}} {{company-wide}} narrative {{that led to}} an on-screen rivalry between professional wrestling veterans, who played the villains, and the younger talent of the company, who played the heroic characters. Several matches and storylines {{that led to the}} event were connected to this narrative, such as the storyline surrounding the TNA World Heavyweight Championship and the bout pitting Kurt Angle against Jeff Jarrett. This narrative started at TNA's Victory Road PPV event on July13, where Samoa Joe defended the TNA World Heavyweight Championship against Booker T. During the match, Joe relentlessly assaulted Booker T to the point that referees nor security could stop him. This led to Sting interfering in the contest trying to calm Joe down. Joe refused to listen and continued his assault, causing Sting to hit Joe in the stomach with a baseball in order for Joe to stop, resulting in a no contest. Sting did not state a reason as to why he hit Joe in the weeks after the event. At TNA's Hard Justice PPV event on August10, A.J. Styles fought Angle in a Last Man Standing match, which he won after injuring Angle's neck in the contest. After the bout, Styles attacked Angle's injured neck, making the injury more severe in the storyline until Sting attacked Styles to prevent the assault from continuing. On the August14 episode of TNA's television program TNA Impact!, Sting explained that both Joe and Styles had been disrespectful and violent <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>current</b> rivalries and matches. He stated that his actions were to end that type of behavior between the younger wrestlers and the veteran wrestlers.|$|E
