Barre filled the key positions {{in the army and}} security forces with members of three Darood clans closely related to his own reer: the Marehan, Dulbahantes, and Ogaadeens. Adam says that '..As early as 1976, when Colonel Omar Mohamed Farah was asked to train and command a tank brigade stationed in Mogadishu, he <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>out</b> of about 540 soldiers, at least 500 were from the Marehan clan.

Compagnon wrote in 1992: [...] "Colonels and generals were part of the president's personal patronage network; they had to remain loyal to him and his relatives, whether they had command or were temporarily in the cabinet." [...] As a result, by 1990 many Somalis looked upon the armed forces as Siad Barre's personal army. This perception eventually destroyed the military's reputation as a national institution. The critical posts of commander of the 2nd Tank Brigade and 2nd Artillery Brigade in Mogadishu were both held by Marehan officers, as were the posts of commander of the three reserve brigades in Hargeisa in the north.|$|E
