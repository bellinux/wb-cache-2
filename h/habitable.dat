5|$|A 2006 {{study by}} Milan Ćirković and colleagues {{extended}} {{the notion of}} a time-dependent galactic <b>habitable</b> zone, analyzing various catastrophic events as well as the underlying secular evolution of galactic dynamics. The paper considers that the number of <b>habitable</b> planets may fluctuate wildly with time due to the unpredictable timing of catastrophic events, thereby creating a punctuated equilibrium in which <b>habitable</b> planets are more likely at some times than at others. Based on the results of Monte Carlo simulations on a toy model of the Milky Way, the team found that the number of <b>habitable</b> planets is likely to increase with time, though not in a perfectly linear pattern.|$|E
5|$|Although 47 Ursae Majoris b {{is outside}} its star's <b>habitable</b> zone, its {{gravitational}} influence would disrupt {{the orbit of}} planets in the outer part of the <b>habitable</b> zone. In addition, it may have disrupted the formation of terrestrial planets and reduced the delivery of water to any inner planets in the system. Therefore, planets located in the <b>habitable</b> zone of 47 Ursae Majoris {{are likely to be}} small and dry.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 876 c lies at {{the inner}} edge of the system's <b>habitable</b> zone. While the {{prospects}} for life on gas giants are unknown, {{it might be possible}} for a large moon of the planet to provide a <b>habitable</b> environment. Unfortunately tidal interactions between a hypothetical moon, the planet, and the star could destroy moons massive enough to be <b>habitable</b> over the lifetime of the system. In addition it is unclear whether such moons could form in the first place.|$|E
5|$|In <b>Habitable</b> Planets for Man, a 1964 RAND Corporation {{study by}} space {{scientist}} Stephen H. Dole, {{the probability of}} a <b>habitable</b> planet being in orbit around Epsilon Eridani were estimated at 3.3%. Among the known nearby stars, it was listed with the 14 stars that were thought most likely to have a <b>habitable</b> planet.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} theorized that light {{reflections}} and infrared emissions from 47 UMa b, along with tidal influence, could warm any moons {{in orbit around}} it to be <b>habitable,</b> despite the planet being outside the normally accepted <b>habitable</b> zone.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of a}} galactic <b>habitable</b> zone {{was further}} {{developed}} in 2001 in a paper by Ward and Brownlee, in collaboration with Guillermo Gonzalez of the University of Washington. In that paper, Gonzalez, Brownlee, and Ward stated that regions near the galactic halo would lack the heavier elements required to produce <b>habitable</b> terrestrial planets, thus creating an outward limit {{to the size of}} the galactic <b>habitable</b> zone. Being too close to the galactic center, however, would expose an otherwise <b>habitable</b> planet to numerous supernovae and other energetic cosmic events, as well as excessive cometary impacts caused by perturbations of the host star's Oort cloud. Therefore, the authors established an inner boundary for the galactic <b>habitable</b> zone, located just outside the galactic bulge.|$|E
5|$|A galactic bar {{also has}} the {{potential}} to affect the size of the galactic <b>habitable</b> zone. Galactic bars are thought to grow over time, eventually reaching the corotation radius of the galaxy and perturbing the orbits of the stars located there. High-metallicity stars like our Sun, for example, located at an intermediate location between the low-metallicity galactic halo and the high-radiation galactic center, may be scattered throughout the galaxy, affecting the definition of the galactic <b>habitable</b> zone. It has been suggested that for this reason, it may be impossible to properly define a galactic <b>habitable</b> zone.|$|E
5|$|A. The Oriental Pearl Tower {{is not a}} <b>habitable</b> building, but is {{included}} in this list for comparative purposes. Per a ruling by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, freestanding observation towers are {{not considered to be}} buildings, as they are not fully <b>habitable</b> structures.|$|E
5|$|Around {{one in five}} Sun-like {{stars is}} thought to have an Earth-sized planet in its <b>habitable</b> zone.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{luminosity}} measurement, the circumstellar <b>habitable</b> zone (CHZ) {{is believed}} to be located between 0.116 and 0.227AU.|$|E
5|$|C. The Space Needle {{is not a}} <b>habitable</b> building, but is {{included}} in this list for comparative purposes.

5|$|Conditions on Titan {{could become}} far more <b>habitable</b> {{in the far}} future. Five billion years from now, as the Sun becomes a red giant, its surface {{temperature}} could rise enough for Titan to support liquid water on its surface, making it <b>habitable.</b> As the Sun's ultraviolet output decreases, the haze in Titan's upper atmosphere will be depleted, lessening the anti-greenhouse effect {{on the surface and}} enabling the greenhouse created by atmospheric methane to play a far greater role. These conditions together could create a <b>habitable</b> environment, and could persist for several hundred million years. This is proposed to have been sufficient time for simple life to spawn on Earth, though the presence of ammonia on Titan would cause chemical reactions to proceed more slowly.|$|E
5|$|Even on a <b>habitable</b> {{planet with}} enough radioisotopes to heat its interior, various {{prebiotic}} molecules are required {{in order to}} produce life; therefore, the distribution of these molecules in the galaxy is important in determining the galactic <b>habitable</b> zone. A 2008 study by Samantha Blair and colleagues attempted to determine {{the outer edge of the}} galactic <b>habitable</b> zone by means of analyzing formaldehyde and carbon monoxide emissions from various giant molecular clouds scattered throughout the Milky Way; however, the data is neither conclusive nor complete.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 876 b {{currently}} {{lies beyond}} {{the outer edge}} of the <b>habitable</b> zone but because Gliese 876 is a slowly evolving main-sequence red dwarf its <b>habitable</b> zone is very slowly moving outwards and will continue to do so for trillions of years. Therefore, Gliese 876 b will, in trillions of years time, lie inside Gliese 876's <b>habitable</b> zone, as defined by the ability of an Earth-mass planet to retain liquid water at its surface, and remain there for at least 4.6 billion years. While the prospects for life on a gas giant are unknown, large moons may be able to support a <b>habitable</b> environment. Models of tidal interactions between a hypothetical moon, the planet and the star suggest that large moons should be able to survive in orbit around Gliese 876 b for the lifetime of the system. On the other hand, it is unclear whether such moons could form in the first place. However, the large mass of the gas giant may make it more likely for larger moons to form.|$|E
5|$|Newly {{discovered}} planets, particularly {{ones that}} are potentially <b>habitable,</b> have enabled SETI and METI programs to refocus projects for communication with extraterrestrial intelligence. In 2009 A Message From Earth (AMFE) was sent toward the Gliese 581 planetary system, which contains two potentially <b>habitable</b> planets, the confirmed Gliese 581d and the more <b>habitable</b> but unconfirmed Gliese 581g. In the SETILive project, which began in 2012, human volunteers analyze data from the Allen Telescope Array to search for possible alien signals that computers might miss because of terrestrial radio interference. The data for the study is obtained by observing Kepler target stars with the radio telescope.|$|E
5|$|The orbital radius {{at which}} the stellar flux from Epsilon Eridani matches the solar constant—where the {{emission}} matches the Sun's output at the orbital distance of the Earth—is 0.61 astronomical units (AU). That is within the maximum <b>habitable</b> zone of a conjectured Earth-like planet orbiting Epsilon Eridani, which currently stretches from about 0.5 to 1.0AU. As Epsilon Eridani ages {{over a period of}} 20billion years, the net luminosity will increase, causing this zone to slowly expand outward to about 0.6–1.4AU. The presence of a large planet with a highly elliptical orbit in proximity to Epsilon Eridani's <b>habitable</b> zone reduces the likelihood of a terrestrial planet having a stable orbit within the <b>habitable</b> zone.|$|E

5|$|An {{assessment}} of {{the potential impact of}} climate change on this species found that its range is unlikely to contract and may actually grow, depending on how effectively it migrates into newly <b>habitable</b> areas.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{have started}} to {{discover}} extrasolar Earth analogs – planets that lie in the <b>habitable</b> zone of space surrounding a star, and therefore could possibly host {{life as we know}} it.|$|E
5|$|B. The Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument {{is not a}} <b>habitable</b> building; the {{structure}} is included in this list for comparative purposes, but as {{it is not a}} high-rise it is not given a ranking.|$|E
5|$|If finally verified, Gliese 581d would {{constitute}} the first planet identified {{to be located}} in a stellar <b>habitable</b> zone outside of the Solar System, based on studies of 2007.|$|E
5|$|Simulations {{suggest that}} the inner part of the <b>habitable</b> zone of 47 Ursae Majoris could host a {{terrestrial}} planet in a stable orbit, though the outer regions of the <b>habitable</b> zone would be disrupted by the gravitational influence of the planet 47 UMa b. However, {{the presence of a}} giant planet within 2.5 AU of the star may have disrupted planet formation in the inner system, and reduced the amount of water delivered to inner planets during accretion. This may mean any terrestrial planets orbiting in the <b>habitable</b> zone of 47 Ursae Majoris are likely to be small and dry. , there have been two METI messages sent to 47 Ursae Majoris. Both were transmitted from Eurasia's largest radar — 70-meter (230-foot) Eupatoria Planetary Radar. The first message, the Teen Age Message, was sent on September 3, 2001, and it will arrive at 47 Ursae Majoris in July 2047. The second message, Cosmic Call 2, was sent on July 6, 2003, and it will arrive at 47 Ursae Majoris in May 2049.|$|E
5|$|Since HD 28185 b orbits in its star's <b>habitable</b> zone, {{some have}} speculated on the {{possibility}} of life on worlds in the HD 28185 system. While it is unknown whether gas giants can support life, simulations of tidal interactions suggest that HD 28185 b could harbor Earth-mass satellites in orbit around it for many billions of years. Such moons, if they exist, may be able to provide a <b>habitable</b> environment, though it is unclear whether such satellites would form in the first place. Additionally, a small planet in one of the gas giant's Trojan points could survive in a <b>habitable</b> orbit for long periods. The high mass of HD 28185 b, of over six Jupiter masses, actually makes either of these scenarios more likely than if the planet was about Jupiter's mass or less.|$|E
5|$|The Lineweaver {{team also}} {{analyzed}} {{the evolution of}} the galactic <b>habitable</b> zone with respect to time, finding, for example, that stars close to the galactic bulge had to form within a time window of about two billion years in order to have <b>habitable</b> planets. Before that window, galactic-bulge stars would be prevented from having life-sustaining planets from frequent supernova events. After the supernova threat had subsided, though, the increasing metallicity of the galactic core would eventually mean that stars there would have a high number of giant planets, with the potential to destabilize star systems and radically alter the orbit of any planet located in a star's circumstellar <b>habitable</b> zone. Simulations conducted in 2005 at the University of Washington, however, show that even in the presence of hot Jupiters, terrestrial planets may remain stable over long timescales.|$|E

5|$|The {{chemistry}} of life {{may have begun}} shortly after the Big Bang, 13.8 billion years ago, during a <b>habitable</b> epoch when the Universe was only 10–17 million years old.|$|E

5|$|About 73 {{percent of}} Japan is forested, mountainous and {{unsuitable}} for agricultural, industrial or residential use. As a result, the <b>habitable</b> zones, mainly located in coastal areas, have extremely high population densities. Japan {{is one of}} the most densely populated countries in the world.|$|E
5|$|Cassini has {{provided}} {{strong evidence that}} Enceladus has an ocean with an energy source, nutrients and organic molecules, making Enceladus {{one of the best}} places for the study of potentially <b>habitable</b> environments for extraterrestrial life. By contrast, the water thought to be on Jupiter's moon Europa is located under a much thicker layer of ice.|$|E
5|$|Following the drilling, a hole {{opens up}} in the object's {{interior}} wall. Inside, Quatermass and the others find the remains of insect-like aliens resembling giant three-legged locusts, with stubby antennae on their heads giving the impression of horns. As Quatermass and Roney examine the remains, they theorise the aliens {{may have come from}} a planet <b>habitable</b> five million years ago– Mars.|$|E
5|$|HD 28185 b takes 1.04 {{years to}} orbit its parent star. Unlike most known long-period planets, {{the orbit of}} HD 28185 b has a low eccentricity, {{comparable}} to that of Mars in the Solar System. The orbit lies entirely within its star's <b>habitable</b> zone.|$|E
5|$|On December 19, 2012, {{evidence}} was presented that suggest {{a system of}} five planets orbiting Tau Ceti. The planets' estimated minimum masses are between two and six times the mass of Earth and their orbital periods range from 14 to 640 days. One of them, tentatively named Tau Ceti e, appears to orbit about half as far from Tau Ceti as Earth does from the Sun. With Tau Ceti's luminosity of 52% that of the Sun and {{a distance from the}} star of 0.552 AU, the planet would receive 1.71 times as much stellar radiation as Earth does, slightly less than Venus with 1.91 times Earth's. Nevertheless, some research places it within the star's <b>habitable</b> zone. The Planetary Habitability Laboratory has estimated that Tau Ceti f, which would receive 28.5% as much starlight as Earth, would be narrowly within the <b>habitable</b> zone of the star as well.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} basic {{requirements}} for the existence of life around a star is the ability of that star to produce a terrestrial planet of sufficient mass to sustain it. Various elements, such as iron, magnesium, titanium, carbon, oxygen, silicon, and others, are required to produce <b>habitable</b> planets, and the concentration and ratios of these vary throughout the galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Ordinary {{supernova}} explosions {{can have}} the same effects as GRBs on Earth's atmosphere if they are close enough. Locally, supernovas are much more frequent events than GRBs, with a possibility of occurring closer to Earth. In the field of astrobiology, the rate and distribution of supernovas are used to define {{what is known as}} the Galactic <b>Habitable</b> Zone.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent studies {{saw more}} {{fundamental}} {{revision of the}} old concept of the galactic <b>habitable</b> zone as an annulus. In 2008, a study by Nikos Prantzos revealed that, while {{the probability of a}} planet escaping sterilization by supernova was highest at a distance of about 10 kpc from the galactic center, the sheer density of stars in the inner galaxy meant that the highest number of <b>habitable</b> planets could be found there. The research was corroborated in a 2011 paper by Michael Gowanlock, who calculated the frequency of supernova-surviving planets as a function of their distance from the galactic center, their height above the galactic plane, and their age, ultimately discovering that about 0.3% of stars in the galaxy could today support complex life, or 1.2% if one does not consider the tidal locking of red dwarf planets as precluding the development of complex life.|$|E
