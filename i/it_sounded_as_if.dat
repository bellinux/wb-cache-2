25|$|Ström {{headed off}} towards Åby to inform {{them of the}} {{accident}} and met Mr. Andersson, a track walker. From a nearby house, Andersson called Åby and notified them of the accident. Track walker Eriksson arrived from his house east of the accident site. His wife had lowered the boom barrier at the railway crossing and was standing {{and waiting for the}} train when she thought <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the train had stopped, so Eriksson quickly went {{to the site of the}} derailment. Once he saw that the telegraph poles were aslant, he knew that something serious had occurred. Upon seeing that the train had derailed, he hurried to Getå Halt to notify Krokek Station what had occurred.|$|E
25|$|Many {{accounts}} {{state that}} both men fired in near perfect unison. Some stated <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> one shot had been fired. “One witness said {{it looked as}} if the guns were spitting fire at the same time.” Then, a number of shots followed, ranging between five and nine according to different testimonies. As reports tell of a total of five entry wounds in the two men, the minimum number of shots fired had to be five. The exchange occurred rapidly. Reid received a bullet to one leg. Reid fired two more rounds, one grazing Smith’s left arm and the other striking his left thigh above the knee and exiting the other side. Chambering his Winchester, Smith sent a bullet into Reid’s lower abdomen and groin. Reid fell face down upon the planking, severely wounded. It is not known if Smith remained standing or also had fallen.|$|E
500|$|Nelson and {{the band}} {{encountered}} problems in producing {{some aspects of the}} song. According to Champion, [...] "...it was really difficult to record, because it worked at about five or six different tempos. It was a tough choice of choosing which tempo to play, because sometimes it sounded too rushed, and sometimes <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it was dragging..." [...] The band was trying to get the right tempo, according to Nelson, [...] "because a beat either side of the tempo we picked didn't have the same groove". To improve the song, they recorded this part live and Buckland overdubbed his guitar. They recorded it two or three times until Nelson {{and the band}} were happy at the output. The backing vocals were recorded in the control room of Quadrangle.|$|E

500|$|... "So Appalled" [...] {{received}} mostly favorable {{reviews from}} contemporary critics. [...] David Browne of Time {{wrote that he}} felt that the track was [...] "built on rumbling tanks of pianos and strings" [...] and that <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> West was [...] "marching into the apocalypse." [...] David Amidon of PopMatters compared the production to West's album Late Registration which found West [...] "inviting his friend Jon Brion to impart slices of film scoring to the odds and ends of his tracks". He commented that much like every song on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, the song [...] "contains an underscore as ambitious as the beats upfront", concluding that tracks [...] "Hell of a Life" [...] and [...] "So Appalled" [...] alone [...] "carry enough auditory sugar to make listening to this album on any regular sort of listening device almost a fool's errand." ...|$|E
500|$|The two {{original}} songs sung by New Directions {{were rated}} from excellent to abysmal. Benigno gave each song a [...] "B+"; {{he called the}} duet, [...] "Pretending", [...] "lovely". The nicest thing Kubicek wrote {{of it was that}} <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the lyrics had been [...] "written by a lovesick teenage boy", and he called [...] "Light Up the World" [...] a [...] "trainwreck". Berk was even harsher: [...] "When the show has carte blanche access to every amazing song in the history of popular music, there's something terribly humiliating about watching the kids sing this shit tune as their finale, and do so with such desperate conviction." [...] Gonzalez gave [...] "Light Up the World" [...] a [...] "B+", but said it sounded a [...] "bit too much" [...] like [...] "Loser Like Me", and while Benigno thought it had a better melody than [...] "Loser" [...] and also made [...] "much better use of the Gleeks as a whole", he criticized the chorus for its similarity to [...] "Let It Rock" [...] by Kevin Rudolf. Semigran said it was an [...] "uplifting, if not rather lackluster pop song", yet Hankinson called it his favorite number in the episode.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the crew}} was alarmed by the thunder-like sound of the waves {{slamming}} against her flat bottom. Reed and Vogak wrote that at times <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the ship had hit a hard rock. Around 10 a.m. {{of the next day}} the hull cracked, the space between inner and outer bottoms was flooded, and Vogak rushed his ship to a safe anchorage in Ferrol. The divers discovered a five-meter-long dent and numerous cracks in the fore segment of the hull which were ultimately blamed on waves. Popov concurred and admitted his failure [...] "to foresee the effects of shallow draft". He wrote that the damage had dual mechanism: first, when the flat pontoon pitched above the waves, gravity subjected it to an enormous stress, bending the whole structure down. Next, as it plummeted down, the flat bottom hit water head-on, rupturing the rivets and tearing off the crossbeams. Reed noted that the radial framing pattern chosen by the designers resulted in a strong center section and inadequately weak extremities, and that any experienced shipbuilder should have discovered this weakness in advance.|$|E

6000|$|... "'Chick-a-dee-dee, ma'am, chick-a-dee-dee!'" [...] {{answered}} the {{bird in the}} same cheerful tone. And <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he said, 'I shall be cared for. I'm not afraid.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, do {{call him}} in and make him dance!" [...] cried the girls, all {{chirping}} at once, till <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> a flock of sparrows had taken possession of the shed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not entirely, if it please your honour," [...] said Joceline; [...] "but <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{you were}} preaching a sermon, {{and has a}} marvellous twang of {{doctrine}} with it." ...|$|R
50|$|Siegel's Paradox {{is a way}} of {{investing}} in foreign investments to make money. The technique works (mathematically), but it is called a paradox because <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> should not. Fischer Black credits the idea to Jeremy Siegel.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm not--if {{it means}} what <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>it</b> did," [...] Jacob replied. [...] "I am asked here because I am very rich {{and because the}} Marquis is {{interested}} in money-making schemes. Do you like being a nursery governess?" ...|$|R
60|$|At {{the same}} moment the {{children}} fired, the Indians in hiding discharged their weapons, detonations being echoed and reëchoed from mountain to mountain, until <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> a severe engagement was in progress.|$|E
6000|$|<b>It</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he {{were asking}} if he had caught cold or hurt his foot, and Strether for a minute but smoked and smoked. [...] "I {{want to see her}} again. I must see her." ...|$|E
60|$|Again {{and again}} the {{question}} was asked, and the answer became fainter and fainter, although <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it was a distant cry in response to Rujub's shout rather than spoken in an ordinary voice.|$|E
50|$|The musicians {{included}} the Everlys on guitars, Floyd Cramer on piano, Floyd Chance on bass and Buddy Harman on drums. The distinctive drum sound {{was achieved by}} recording the drums with a tape loop, making <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> there were two drummers.|$|R
5000|$|... "By {{fostering}} {{better life}} decisions and stronger relationship skills, marriage programs can increase child well-being and adult happiness and reduce child poverty and welfare dependence.

6000|$|... "That's splendid!" [...] {{she exclaimed}} {{and he could}} not doubt the {{approval}} in her voice. <b>It</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she meant to applaud him as well as show her satisfaction with the consequences of his exploit.|$|E
60|$|Then Mr. Tod rushed upon Tommy Brock, and Tommy Brock {{grappled with}} Mr. Tod amongst the broken crockery, {{and there was}} a terrific battle all over the kitchen.

60|$|Hardly had Peter {{curled up}} for that nap {{when he heard a}} voice. <b>It</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it came from a long way off, but he knew just where it came from. It came from the doorway of that old house. He knew, too, whose voice it was. It was Jimmy Skunk's voice.|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't {{listen to}} such talk, daddy; for <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{you were out}} of your head again, as when we were alone that night. You'll perk up after we're at Antelope Spring, an' show the people there what you can do." ...|$|R

50|$|During the 1981 Major League Baseball strike, Giants radio {{flagship}} KNBR rebroadcast Game 7, electronically re-editing NBC Radio announcer George Kell's description to make <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> McCovey's ninth-inning liner {{had gotten}} past Richardson, with Alou and Mays scoring {{to win the}} game and Series for San Francisco.|$|R
60|$|How {{long this}} fearful stillness lasted I do not know, but the prince {{gradually}} {{felt his heart}} turning to ice, his hair stood up like bristles, and a cold chill was creeping down his spine, when at last--oh, ecstasy!--a faint noise broke on his straining ears, and this life of shadows suddenly became real. <b>It</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> a troop of horses were ploughing their way over a moor.|$|E
60|$|Her exclamation {{of welcome}} {{reassured}} me. <b>It</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I {{had been the}} very man she wanted to see. My curiosity was awakened. She drew me in, and the faithful Anna, the elderly German maid, closed the door, but did not go away afterwards. She remained near it as if in readiness to let me out presently. It appeared that Miss Haldin {{had been on the}} point of going out to find me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't look so high, Peter; don't look so high," [...] {{said the}} voice with a chuckle. This time <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it came {{right out of the}} trunk of the tree. Peter stared at the trunk and then {{suddenly}} laughed right out. Just a few feet above the ground was a good sized hole in the tree, and poking his head out of it was a funny little fellow with big eyes and a hooked beak.|$|E
50|$|Another time, Haney {{had what}} seemed to be an entire company {{in the back of his}} truck. One person comes out to speak to him.

50|$|John {{was famous}} for his nose whistle, a {{whistling}} sound he would make, both on purpose and involuntarily, through his nose.
