40|$|Apart from mathematics, {{covering}} {{techniques have}} long been known as a powerful tool in different areas of science, especially in those fields dealing with representation and analysis of large structural objects. In such a context, {{one of the key}} properties of graph covers is that all the information about a (usually) large covering graph can be encoded by means of voltages assigned to directed edges of a (relatively) small base graph. In addition, the study of structural properties of covering graphs often reduces to the study of voltage distribution on the base graph. Combinatorial techniques developed for this purpose are based on the concept <b>of</b> <b>lifting</b> automorphism along covering projections. The aim of this Thesis is twofold. Firstly, to develop adequate algorithms for solving certain natural problems regarding lifting automorphisms. And secondly, to provide an appropriate software package for practical usage. An efficient algorithm for testing whether a given automorphism lifts along a covering projection, given in terms of voltages, is presented. Further, algorithms for analysing the structure <b>of</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>groups</b> along combinatorially given regular covering projection are developed: an algorithm for finding a presentation <b>of</b> the <b>lifted</b> <b>group,</b> an algorithm for testing whether the lifted group is a split extension, and algorithm for testing whether the lifted group is a sectional split extension. All algorithms avoid explicit constructions of the covering graph as well as <b>of</b> the <b>lifted</b> <b>group,</b> since such constructions are time and space consuming in general. In addition, methods for generating those covering projections along which a given <b>group</b> <b>of</b> automorphisms <b>lifts,</b> are presented. In particular, a method for finding regular covering projections along which a given <b>group</b> <b>of</b> automorphisms <b>lifts</b> as a sectional split extension, is given. ...|$|R

The projection ℘N is vertex-transitive (edge-transitive) if some vertex-transitive (edge-transitive) subgroup <b>of</b> the automorphism <b>group</b> <b>of</b> X <b>lifts</b> along ℘N, and semisymmetric if it is edge- but not vertex-transitive. The projection ℘N is minimal semisymmetric if it cannot be written as a composition ℘N=℘℘M of two (nontrivial) regular covering projections, where ℘M is semisymmetric. Malnič et al. [Semisymmetric elementary abelian covers of the Möbius–Kantor graph, Discrete Math. 307 (2007) 2156 – 2175] determined all pairwise nonisomorphic minimal semisymmetric elementary abelian regular covering projections of the Möbius–Kantor graph, the Generalized Petersen graph GP(8, 3), by explicitly giving the corresponding voltage rules generating the covering projections. It was remarked {{at the end of}} the above paper that the covering graphs arising from these covering projections need not themselves be semisymmetric (a graph with regular valency is said to be semisymmetric if its automorphism group is edge- but not vertex-transitive).

This effect is typically thought to be a consequence of the lifter's expectation that the large object will outweigh the small object, because objects of the same type typically get heavier as they get larger. Here, we show that this perceptual effect can occur across object category, where there are no strong expectations about the correspondence between size and mass. One <b>group</b> <b>of</b> participants <b>lifted</b> same-colored large and small cubes with the same mass as one another, while another group lifted differently-colored large and small cubes with the same mass as one another. The group who lifted the same-colored cubes experienced a robust SWI and initially lifted the large object with more force than the small object. By contrast, the group who lifted the different-colored objects did so with equal initial forces on the first trial, but experienced just as strong an illusion as those who lifted the same-colored objects. These results demonstrate that color cues can selectively influence the application of fingertip force rates while not impacting at all upon the lifter's perception of object weight, highlighting a stark dissociation in how prior information affects perception and action...|$|R
