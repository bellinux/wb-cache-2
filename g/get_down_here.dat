500|$|The {{sessions}} for Ringo {{coincided with a}} spirit of reconciliation among the four ex-Beatles. This was partly due to Starr, Lennon and Harrison's decision to sever their business ties with Allen Klein, whose control of Apple had been the cause of bitter division between them and McCartney. Klaus Voormann, {{a friend of the}} Beatles since their early years in Hamburg, also cites a willingness on the part of all the album's contributors to help Starr fully establish himself as a solo artist. With Richard Perry as his producer, Starr recorded the rhythm track for [...] "I'm the Greatest" [...] at Sunset Sound Recorders in Los Angeles on 13 March 1973. Lennon played on the session, as did Harrison, who was in Los Angeles for meetings relating to two upcoming Beatles compilations, 1962–1966 and 1967–1970, and to produce a new album by Ravi Shankar. Hearing that Starr and Lennon were working together, Harrison phoned the studio and asked Perry if he could attend. Lennon welcomed Harrison's participation, saying: [...] "Hell yes... Tell him to <b>get</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> right away and help me finish [...] this bridge." ...|$|E
2500|$|James was the DJ for WWDC, a {{radio station}} in Washington, DC. Eventually he decided to pursue Albert's {{suggestion}} to him and asked the station's promotion director to get British Overseas Airways Corporation to ship in a copy of [...] "I Want to Hold Your Hand" [...] from Britain. Albert related what happened next: [...] "Carroll James called me up the day he got the record and said 'If you can <b>get</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> by 5 o'clock, we'll let you introduce it.'" [...] Albert managed {{to get to the}} station in time, and introduced the record with: [...] "Ladies and gentlemen, {{for the first time on}} the air in the United States, here are the Beatles singing 'I Want to Hold Your Hand.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Uncommonly early,’ {{observed}} Watkins Tottle, {{with an air}} of triumphant self-denial. ‘I shall {{hardly be}} able to <b>get</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> by that hour.’ (This was intended for a joke.) ...|$|E

6000|$|She {{glanced at}} her sister, but Mrs. Devine resolutely shook her head. [...] "I have seen quite {{as much of the}} cañon as I have any wish to do," [...] she said. [...] "Besides, it was not exactly an easy matter <b>getting</b> <b>down</b> <b>here,</b> and I expect it will be {{considerably}} worse getting up. You can go with Mr. Brooke, my dear." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said he, {{punching}} his pole down to {{the bottom}} of the brook; [...] "yes, it isn't deep. The old General will <b>get</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> very well, I think." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pretty place, this, Miss Lalonde, isn't it?" [...] he remarked. [...] "It's a {{real nice}} change for {{business}} men like Mr. Chetwode and myself to <b>get</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> {{for an hour or}} two's quiet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{the reason}} I wanted to <b>get</b> you <b>down</b> <b>here,</b> Austen," [...] he cried; [...] "that's what I've been telling {{the old man}} all along--perhaps he'll believe you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{said that}} to <b>get</b> Pat <b>down</b> <b>here</b> I promised him that we--you and I--would spend {{a week in the}} woods with him this winter. Is that {{perfectly}} clear?" [...] Hal spoke slowly and with emphasis.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Then pray, Budden, {{write to}} your cousin at once,’ replied Mrs. Budden. ‘Who knows, {{if we could}} only <b>get</b> him <b>down</b> <b>here,</b> but he might take a fancy to our Alexander, and leave him his property?—Alick, my dear, take your legs off the rail of the chair!’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'You will <b>get</b> <b>down</b> <b>here,</b> Mr. Melas,' said my companion. 'I {{am sorry}} to leave you so far from your house, {{but there is no}} alternative. Any attempt upon your part to follow the {{carriage}} can only end in injury to yourself.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Redpoll laughed {{harder than}} ever. [...] "Yes," [...] said he, [...] "it is. I am afraid {{you would be}} a very old and very gray Rabbit by the time you got there. I guess the next thing is for you to make the {{acquaintance}} of some of us who <b>get</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> once in awhile." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Father," [...] said Rose, {{whose name}} seemed remarkably {{appropriate}} at that moment, [...] "I {{should like to}} <b>get</b> <b>down</b> <b>here,</b> and walk {{the rest of the}} way. By the time I arrive, you'll have had a little talk with poor Jeff and auntie. Besides, there is a pretty cave that I used to gather shells in when I was last here. I would like so much to pay it a visit in passing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So it {{has seemed}} to me, Chippewa. The Injins must {{be there in a}} strong force, and we shall find it no easy matter to get through them. How do you propose to do it?" [...] "Go by in night. No udder way. When can't see, can't see. Dere plenty of rush dere; dat good t'ing, and, p'raps, dat help us. Rush good cover for canoe.

6000|$|... 'Ah, well! that is nothing--nobody minds old Jack. I shall {{let them}} all {{know you were}} as safe as a Turk's wife in a harem, and maybe old Crabbe will hear reason if we <b>get</b> him <b>down</b> <b>here</b> alone, without a viper at each ear, as he had last time.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Sewell, {{rising to}} follow his friend to the door, [...] "I will come to see Barker, and try to talk with him. He's a very {{complicated}} problem. I supposed that I had merely his material prosperity to provide for, after <b>getting</b> him <b>down</b> <b>here,</b> but if I have to reconcile him to the constitution of society!----" ...|$|R
60|$|And {{now they}} began to descend towards the plain, but they met with more {{difficulty}} here than they expected; for, as I observed that the way for some miles went with an ascent towards the farthest part of the hill; that continued ascent had, by degrees, brought them to a very great, and in some places, impassable descent; so that, however my guide found his way down, when I was through, {{it was not easy}} for them to do it, who were so many in number, and encumbered with mules and horses, and with their baggage, so that they knew not what to do; and, if they had not known that our ships were gone away, there had been some odds but, like the Israelites of old, they would have murmured against their leader, and have all gone back to Egypt. In a word, they were at their wits' end, and knew not what course to take for two or three days, trying and essaying to <b>get</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> and there, and then frightened with precipices and rocks, and climbing up to get back again. The whole of the matter was, that they had missed a narrow way, where they should have turned off to the south-east, the marks which our men had made before having not been so regular and exact just there, as {{in other parts of the}} way, or some other turning being so very like the same, that they took one for the other; and thus, going straight forward too far before they turned, they came to an opening indeed, and saw the plain country under them, as they had done before, but the descent was not so practicable.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ain't he a dear little man?" [...] said Captain Jim gloatingly. [...] "I do love {{to watch}} a little child asleep, Mistress Blythe. It's the most {{beautiful}} sight in the world, I reckon. Joe does love to <b>get</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> for a night, because I have him sleep with me. At home he has to sleep {{with the other two}} boys, and he doesn't like it. Why can't I sleep with father, Uncle Jim?" [...] says he. 'Everybody in the Bible slept with their fathers.' As for the questions he asks, the minister himself couldn't answer them. They fair swamp me. 'Uncle Jim, if I wasn't ME who'd I be?' and, 'Uncle Jim, what would happen if God died?' He fired them two off at me tonight, afore he went to sleep. As for his imagination, it sails away from everything. He makes up the most remarkable yarns--and then his mother shuts him up in the closet for telling stories. And he sits down and makes up another one, and has it ready to relate to her when she lets him out. He had one for me when he come down tonight. 'Uncle Jim,' says he, solemn as a tombstone, 'I had a 'venture in the Glen today.' 'Yes, what was it?' says I, expecting something quite startling, but nowise prepared for what I really got. 'I met a wolf in the street,' says he, 'a 'normous wolf with a big, red mouf and AWFUL long teeth, Uncle Jim.' 'I didn't know there was any wolves up at the Glen,' says I. 'Oh, he comed there from far, far away,' says Joe, 'and I fought he was going to eat me up, Uncle Jim.' 'Were you scared?' says I. 'No, 'cause I had a big gun,' says Joe, 'and I shot the wolf dead, Uncle Jim,--solid dead--and then he went up to heaven and bit God,' says he. Well, I was fair staggered, Mistress Blythe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You pack up that {{precious}} bag {{of tricks}} of yours," [...] I should have said to him (it would have been rude, but that is how I should have felt), [...] "and get outside with it. I'm not taking anything in your line to-day. I don't require any supernatural aid to get me into trouble. All the worry I want I can <b>get</b> <b>down</b> <b>here,</b> so it's no good your calling. You take that little joke of yours,--I don't know what it is, but I know enough not to want to know,--and run it off on some other idiot. I'm not priggish. I {{have no objection to}} an innocent game of 'catch-questions' in the ordinary way, and when I get a turn myself. But if I've got to pay every time, and the stakes are to be my earthly happiness plus my future existence--why, I don't play. There was the case of Midas; a nice, shabby trick you fellows played off upon him! making pretence you did not understand him, twisting round the poor old fellow's words, just for all the world as though you were a pack of Old Bailey lawyers, trying to trip up a witness; I'm ashamed of the lot of you, and I tell you so--coming down here, fooling poor unsuspecting mortals with your nonsense, as though we had not enough to harry us as it was. Then there was that other case of the poor old peasant couple to whom you promised three wishes, the whole thing ending in a black pudding. And they never got even that. You thought that funny, I suppose. That was your fairy humour! A pity, I say, you have not, all of you, something better to do with your time. As I said before, you take that celestial 'Joe Miller' of yours and work it off on somebody else. I have read my fairy lore, and I have read my mythology, and I don't want any of your blessings. And what's more, I'm not going to have them. When I want blessings I will put up with the usual sort we are accustomed to down here. You know the ones I mean, the disguised brand--the blessings that no human being would think were blessings, if he were not told; the blessings that don't look like blessings, that don't feel like blessings; that, as a matter of fact, are not blessings, practically speaking; the blessings that other people think are blessings for us and that we don't. They've got their drawbacks, but they are better than yours, at any rate, and they are sooner over. I don't want your blessings at any price. If you leave one here I shall simply throw it out after you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Oh, Edie!' cried Ernest, {{stopping}} a moment, and {{gazing at the}} little light airy figure. 'I only wish you could know the difference. Coming from Dunbude to Calcombe is like coming from darkness into light. Up there one meets with nobody but essentially vulgar-minded selfish people--people whose whole life is passed in thinking and talking about nothing but dogs, and horses, and partridges, and salmon; racing, and hunting, and billiards, and wines; amusements, amusements, amusements, all of them coarse {{and most of them}} cruel, all day long. Their talk is just like the talk of grooms and gamekeepers in a public-house parlour, only a little improved by better English and more money. Will So-and-so win the Derby? What a splendid run we had with the West Somerset on Wednesday! Were you in at the death of that big fox at Coulson's Corner? Ought the new vintages of Madeira to be bottled direct or sent round the Cape like the old ones? Capital burlesque at the Gaiety, but very slow at the Lyceum. Who will go to the Duchess of Dorsetshire's dance on the twentieth:--and so forth for ever. Their own petty round of selfish pleasures from week's end to week's end--no thought of anybody else, no thought of the world at large, no thought even of any higher interest in their own personalities. Their politics are just a selfish calculation of their own prospects--land, Church, capital, privilege. Their religion (when they have any) is just a selfish regard for their own personal future welfare. From the time I went to Dunbude to this day, I've never heard a single word about any higher thought of any sort--I don't mean only about the troubles or the aspirations of other people, but even about books, about science, about art, about natural beauty. They {{live in a world of}} amusing oneself and of amusing oneself in vulgar fashions--as a born clown would do if he came suddenly into a large fortune. The women are just as bad as the men, only in a different way--not always even that; for most of them think only of the Four-in-hand Club and the pigeon-shooting at Hurlingham--things to sicken one. Now, I've known selfish people before, but not selfish people utterly without any tincture of culture. I come away from Dunbude, and come down here to Calcombe: and the difference in the atmosphere makes one's very breath come and go freer. And I look at you, Edie, and think of you beside Lady Hilda Tregellis, and I laugh in my heart at the difference that artificial rules have made between you. I wish you knew how immeasurably her superior you are in every way. The fact is, it's a comfort to escape from Dunbude for a while and <b>get</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> to feel oneself once more, in the only true sense of the word, in a little good society.' ...|$|E

5000|$|Haggard {{had already}} {{recorded}} several sides for Tally, a record label formed by cousins Lewis Tally and Fuzzy Owen, {{when he was}} approached by producer Ken Nelson to jump to Capitol. Initially Haggard refused, opting to remain loyal to Owen and Tally, but Tally Records {{did not have the}} resources to break Haggard, who was creating quite a buzz in California. In Daniel Cooper's essay for the 1994 retrospective Down Every Road, Nelson remembers, [...] "So I called Fuzzy, and I said, 'Hey, come on, <b>get</b> <b>down</b> <b>here</b> and let's settle this thing. Because you're not gonna sell records. You don't have the facilities, you don't have the promotion department, you don't have anything.' So he came down, and we signed Merle, and I bought all of his masters. And that's how Merle came on the label." [...] The deal meant Capitol obtained nearly two albums worth of material, including the recordings Haggard had made with Bonnie Owens. Fuzzy Owen became Haggard's manager and co-producer with Nelson at Capitol.|$|E
