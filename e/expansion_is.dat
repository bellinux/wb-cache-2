5|$|Over time, the Universe and its {{contents}} have evolved; for example, the relative population of quasars and galaxies has changed and space itself has expanded. Due to this expansion, scientists on Earth can observe the light from a galaxy 30 billion light years away even though that light has traveled for only 13 billion years; the very space between them has expanded. This <b>expansion</b> <b>is</b> consistent with the observation that the light from distant galaxies has been redshifted; the photons emitted have been stretched to longer wavelengths and lower frequency during their journey. Analyses of Type Ia supernovae indicate that the spatial <b>expansion</b> <b>is</b> accelerating.|$|E
5|$|About {{four stages}} of {{glaciation}} {{have been recognized}} in the area during the Pleistocene, although the glacial history is poorly known. Monte Burney was glaciated during the last glacial maximum. During the early Holocene, glaciers retreated quickly then slowed down during the Antarctic Cold Reversal. A slight <b>expansion</b> <b>is</b> noted during the Little Ice Age.|$|E
5|$|In November 2014, the Czech {{air force}} {{commander}} General Libor Štefánik proposed leasing a further six Gripens due to Russia's deteriorating {{relationship with the}} West. According to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Defence, this proposal is just a personal vision {{of the air force}} commander. The fleet <b>expansion</b> <b>is</b> not on the agenda for years to come. More recently, the air force decided to upgrade its fleet to the MS20 configuration.|$|E

5|$|Large {{particle}} accelerators can replicate {{the conditions that}} prevailed after the early moments of the universe, resulting in confirmation and refinement {{of the details of}} the Big Bang model. However, these accelerators can only probe so far into high energy regimes. Consequently, the state of the universe in the earliest instants of the Big Bang <b>expansion</b> <b>is</b> still poorly understood and an area of open investigation and speculation.|$|E
5|$|That {{space is}} {{undergoing}} metric <b>expansion</b> <b>is</b> shown by direct observational {{evidence of the}} Cosmological principle and the Copernican principle, which together with Hubble's law have no other explanation. Astronomical redshifts are extremely isotropic and homogeneous, supporting the Cosmological principle that the universe looks the same in all directions, along with much other evidence. If the redshifts {{were the result of}} an explosion from a center distant from us, they would not be so similar in different directions.|$|E
5|$|The {{reserve is}} {{important}} for some scarce breeding species, such as pied avocets on the islands, and western marsh harriers, Eurasian bitterns and bearded reedlings in the reeds, and is also a major migration stopoff and wintering site. There are also several nationally or locally scarce invertebrates and plants specialised for this coastal habitat.

5|$|Due to the coyote's {{wide range}} and {{abundance}} throughout North America, it {{is listed as}} least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The coyote's pre-Columbian range {{was limited to the}} Southwest and Plains regions of the United States and Canada, and northern and central Mexico. By the 19th century, the species expanded north and east, expanding further after 1900, coinciding with land conversion and the extirpation of wolves. By this time, its range encompassed all of the United States and Mexico, southward into Central America, and northward into most of Canada and Alaska. This <b>expansion</b> <b>is</b> ongoing, and the species now occupies the majority of areas between 8°N (Panama) and 70°N (northern Alaska).|$|E
5|$|Expansion {{sets are}} {{currently}} released in a two-set block, {{starting with a}} large set and ending with a smaller one three months later. Prior to 2016, expansion sets were released in a three-set block (again, beginning with a larger set followed by two smaller sets). These sets consist almost exclusively of newly designed cards. Contrasting with the wide-ranging Core Set, each <b>expansion</b> <b>is</b> focused around a subset of mechanics and ties into a set storyline. Expansions also dedicate several cards {{to a handful of}} particular, often newly introduced, game mechanics.|$|E
5|$|However, some <b>expansion</b> <b>is</b> planned. In {{order to}} compete with Air Iceland, which {{operates}} service from Reykjavik Airport to Nuuk, Narsarsuaq, Ilulissat and {{the east coast of}} Greenland and now controls about 15% the market in Greenland-bound travel, Air Greenland may open a nonstop route between Nuuk and Keflavík International Airport in Iceland. Also, owing to improved technology and higher commodity prices, the Maarmorilik mines were due to reopen in November 2010 with zinc and iron ore reserves projected to last 50 years. As in the 1970s, the mine's supply flights to the mine will be operated by Air Greenland, using Bell helicopters (212s) based out of the Uummannaq Heliport.|$|E

5|$|In 2017, NATO officially {{recognized}} three aspiring members: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, and Macedonia. Macedonia {{has been}} prevented from joining the alliance by Greece, one {{effect of the}} Macedonian naming dispute. Future <b>expansion</b> <b>is</b> currently a topic of debate in several countries outside the alliance, and countries like Sweden, Finland, and Serbia have open political debate {{on the topic of}} membership, while in countries like Ukraine, support and opposition to membership is tied to ethnic and nationalist ideologies. The incorporation of countries formerly in the Eastern Bloc has been a cause of increased tension between NATO countries and Russia.|$|E
5|$|Lithium's {{coefficient}} of thermal <b>expansion</b> <b>is</b> {{twice that of}} aluminium and almost four times that of iron. Lithium is superconductive below 400 μK at standard pressure and at higher temperatures (more than 9 K) at very high pressures (>20 GPa). At temperatures below 70 K, lithium, like sodium, undergoes diffusionless phase change transformations. At 4.2 K it has a rhombohedral crystal system (with a nine-layer repeat spacing); at higher temperatures it transforms to face-centered cubic and then body-centered cubic. At liquid-helium temperatures (4 K) the rhombohedral structure is prevalent. Multiple allotropic forms have been identified for lithium at high pressures.|$|E
5|$|The Waterloo Wind Farm is a 111 MW {{wind farm}} which was {{completed}} in 2010 at an estimated cost of $300 million. Thirty-seven Vestas V90 3 MW turbines stretch over the 18km wind farm site and are connected through a 33 kilovolt (kV) internal reticulation network to the wind farm substation. The wind farm is approximately 30 kilometres south-east of the township of Clare and 100km north of Adelaide. A Stage 2 expansion was approved to add up to an additional 6 turbines to the existing farm and increase its total generating capacity to over 130 MW. <b>Expansion</b> <b>is</b> expected to commence in 2016.|$|E

The starting point is the town of Far Harbor. The Island, where many unique creatures reside, is blanketed by radioactive fog. Because the creatures that live inside the fog are unwilling to go anywhere without it, the town uses devices called fog condensers to turn the fog into liquid {{in order to protect}} its inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|The stadium was {{designed}} to be capable of supporting future seating expansion to 80,000. The 30,000 seats would be added above the second deck of the stadium {{from the end of the}} press boxes across to the northwest end of the venue, wrapping around the remainder of the horseshoe. The auxiliary video display currently adjacent to the easternmost section of the media areas would likely be relocated to atop the new third deck. The University of Minnesota could add all 30,000 seats in a single addition or in increments of 10,000 seats, meeting demand as it is needed (although the duplicated costs of such a plan make it unlikely). If <b>expansion</b> <b>is</b> ever undertaken, it can be completed in about 9 months so that there would be minimal interruption of a football season.|$|E

The largest park in the city, Assiniboine Park, houses the Assiniboine Park Zoo and the Leo Mol Sculpture Garden. Other large city parks include Kildonan Park and St. Vital Park. The major commercial areas in the city are Polo Park, Kildonan Crossing, South St. Vital, Garden City (West Kildonan), Pembina Strip, Kenaston Smart Centre, Osborne Village, and the Corydon strip. The main cultural and nightlife areas are the Exchange District, The Forks, Osborne Village and Corydon Village (both in Fort Rouge), Sargent and Ellice Avenues (West End) and Old St. Boniface. Osborne Village is Winnipeg's most densely populated neighbourhood, as well {{as one of the most}} densely populated neighbourhoods in Western Canada.|$|E
5|$|Given the {{difficulty}} of finding exact solutions, Einstein's field equations are also solved frequently by numerical integration on a computer, or by considering small perturbations of exact solutions. In the field of numerical relativity, powerful computers are employed to simulate the geometry of spacetime and to solve Einstein's equations for interesting situations such as two colliding black holes. In principle, such methods may be applied to any system, given sufficient computer resources, and may address fundamental questions such as naked singularities. Approximate solutions may also be found by perturbation theories such as linearized gravity and its generalization, the post-Newtonian expansion, {{both of which were}} developed by Einstein. The latter provides a systematic approach to solving for the geometry of a spacetime that contains a distribution of matter that moves slowly compared with the speed of light. The expansion involves a series of terms; the first terms represent Newtonian gravity, whereas the later terms represent ever smaller corrections to Newton's theory due to general relativity. An extension of this <b>expansion</b> <b>is</b> the parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism, which allows quantitative comparisons between the predictions of general relativity and alternative theories.|$|E
