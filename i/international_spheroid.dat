5000|$|The {{geographical}} mile is a unit {{of length}} determined by 1 minute of arc along the Earth's equator. For the 1924 <b>International</b> <b>Spheroid</b> this equalled 1855.4 metres. [...] Any greater precision depends more on choice of standard than on more careful measurement: {{the length of the}} equator in the World Geodetic System WGS-84 is [...] which makes the geographical mile 1855.3248 m, while the International Astronomical Union standard IAU-2000 takes the equator to be [...] making the geographical mile 1855.3257 m, almost a millimetre longer. In any standard, the length of a degree of longitude at the equator is thus exactly 60 geographical miles.|$|E
5000|$|Stecchini makes {{claims that}} {{imply that the}} Egyptian {{measures}} of length, originating from at least the 3rd millennium BC, were directly derived from the circumference of the earth with an amazing accuracy. According to [...] "Secrets of the Great Pyramid" [...] (p. 346 [...] ), his claim is that the Egyptian measurement was equal to 40,075,000 meters, which compared to the <b>International</b> <b>Spheroid</b> of 40,076,596 meters gives an error of 0.004%. No consideration seems {{to be made to}} the question of, on purely technical and procedural grounds, how the early Egyptians, in defining their cubit, could have achieved a degree of accuracy that to our current knowledge can only be achieved with very sophisticated equipment and techniques.|$|E

40|$|<b>International</b> audienceSmall plasma <b>spheroids</b> are {{evidenced}} {{and analyzed}} {{in front of}} the electrodes of a capacitively-coupled radio-frequency discharge in which dust particles are growing. These regions are characterized by a spherical shape, a slightly enhanced luminosity and are related to instabilities induced by the presence of dust particles. Several types of behaviors are identified and particularly their chaotic appearance or disappearance and their rotational motion along the electrode periphery. Correlations with the unstable behavior of the global plasma glow are performed. These analyses are obtained thanks to high-speed imaging which is the only diagnostics able to evidence these plasma spheroids...|$|R
40|$|<b>International</b> audienceMulticellular tumour <b>spheroids</b> (MCTSs) are {{extensively}} used as in-vitro system {{models for}} investigating the avascular growth phase of solid tumours. In this work, we propose a continuous growth model of heterogeneous MCTSs within a porous material, {{taking into account}} a diffusing nutrient from the surrounding material directing both the proliferation rate and the mobility of tumour cells. At the time scale of interest, the MCTS behaves as an incompressible viscous fluid expanding inside a porous medium. The cell motion and proliferation rate are modelled using a non-convective chemotactic mass flux, driving the cell expansion {{in the direction of}} the external nutrients' source. At the early stages, the growth dynamics is derived by solving the quasi-stationary problem, obtaining an initial exponential growth followed by an almost linear regime, in accordance with experimental observations. We also perform a linear-stability analysis of the quasi-static solution in order to investigate the morphological stability of the radially symmetric growth pattern. We show that mechano-biological cues, as well as geometric effects related to the size of the MCTS subdomains with respect to the diffusion length of the nutrient, can drive a morphological transition to fingered structures, thus triggering the formation of complex shapes that might promote tumour invasiveness. The results also point out the formation of a retrograde flow in the MCTS close to the regions where protrusions form, that could describe the initial dynamics of metastasis detachment from the in-vivo tumour mass. In conclusion, the results of the proposed model demonstrate that the integration of mathematical tools in biological research could be crucial for better understanding the tumour's ability to invade its host environment...|$|R
