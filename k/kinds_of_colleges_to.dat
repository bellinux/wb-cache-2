40|$|In this paper, I {{propose a}} few ways, by using GIS tools, to improve public {{outreach}} by Dog River Clearwater Revival. With {{the use of}} the internet and the easy access to web page and programs like Google Earth, a plain satellite image might not get the interest of the public anymore. You do not need <b>to</b> have any <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>college</b> background <b>to</b> be able to use those software and get the image you want. As watershed pollution largely depends on public awareness, I tried {{to find a way to}} make Dog River Watershed more interesting to the public. I created an overview map of the watershed and I also created a 3 D Flythrough of Halls Mill Creek, which is a tributary of Dog River. After creating the 3 D flythrough, I uploaded it to youtube. com, so the public can access it easily. I used ArcGIS to make the basic maps and ArcScene to create the 3 D flythrough of Halls Mill Creek. These maps can be used to show the public a more interesting approach to the Dog River Watershed...|$|R
40|$|A {{longitudinal}} file {{was developed}} containing statistics on almost all {{colleges and universities}} in the country and was used to compute 61 indicators of institutional viability. Particular colleges were identified as being in distress based on a combination of objective measures: closure, default on a federal loan, extreme enrollment declines, extreme reduction in faculty salaries, and extreme de-clines in current fund revenues and balances. These <b>colleges</b> were used <b>to</b> validate the indicators as being related to distress, sepa-rately by type <b>of</b> <b>college.</b> The validated indicators for each type <b>of</b> <b>college</b> were then used to construct a summary index of viability, which was found <b>to</b> classify accurately <b>colleges</b> that are viable or in distress. Distributions of the summary measure are displayed for various <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>colleges</b> (e. g., traditionally black colleges, women's colleges, 2 -year vocational <b>colleges).</b> Twelve <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>colleges</b> were found <b>to</b> frequently receive low scores on the summary measure.

40|$|Abstract. College {{culture is}} the {{combination}} <b>of</b> <b>college</b> and culture with rich connotation and extension. There is an internal relation between college culture and development of economic society. A comprehensive understanding <b>of</b> the <b>college’s</b> role in the culture and a clear definitude <b>of</b> the <b>college</b> culture’s function in economic and social construction have a great significance {{for the establishment of}} an innovative country and a harmonious socialist society. To promote the cultural construction <b>of</b> <b>Colleges,</b> we must first clear the cultural connotation <b>of</b> <b>college</b> culture, that is, clear what <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>college</b> culture is really needed by society, and then build the long-term mechanism for the construction <b>of</b> <b>college</b> culture. With the development of economic globalization and higher education from elite education <b>to</b> mass education, <b>colleges</b> gradually change from the edge of social life to the center of social life, which has caused the most important revolution since a college organization was built. How to balance the relationship between social utilitarian goals and college cultural mission, how to clear the role <b>of</b> <b>college</b> cultural construction in the college reform and development, how to play the leading role <b>of</b> <b>college</b> culture <b>to</b> social culture, and how <b>to</b> promote personalized <b>college</b> cultural construction with Chinese characteristics is an important issue placed before college researchers and managemen...|$|R
