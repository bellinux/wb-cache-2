These {{included}} {{those of}} the Maria Monk, the allegation of cells under his own Oratory on Hagley Road, Birmingham and those of Giacinto Achilli. Newman emphasises the importance of responding to Achilli: For how, Brothers of the Oratory, can we possibly believe a man like this , in what <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>about</b> persons and facts, and conversations, and events, when he is of the stamp of Maria Monk, of Jeffreys, and of Teodore, and of others who have had their hour, and then been dropped by the indignation or the shame of mankind.|$|E
500|$|Robert Thickett {{reviewed}} {{the book in}} August 2013 for the Mortgage Strategy website. He opined that Occupy felt [...] "nostalgic", largely because the Occupy movement itself [...] "has largely run out of steam." [...] Nevertheless, he thought much of what Chomsky had to say was [...] "practical" [...] {{and that it was}} [...] "difficult to refute much of what <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>about</b> the way Western society is set up." ...|$|E

"Being Green" [...] is [...] {{the first}} non-original {{composition}} Morrison had included on any album for Warner Bros. {{so far and}} was [...] taken from the popular American children's TV show, Sesame Street, which he must have watched with his young daughter, Shana. [...] <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>about</b> his interpretation of the song, [...] "That was just a statement that you don't have to be flamboyant. If somebody doesn't like you just because you're a certain thing, then maybe they're seeing the wrong thing." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{reliability}} of Herodotus is sometimes criticized when writing about Egypt. Alan B. Lloyd argues that, {{as a historical}} document, the writings of Herodotus are seriously defective, {{and that he was}} working from [...] "inadequate sources". Nielsen writes: [...] "Though we cannot entirely rule out the possibility of Herodotus having been in Egypt, it must be said that his narrative bears little witness to it." [...] German historian Detlev Fehling questions whether Herodotus ever traveled up the Nile River, and considers doubtful almost everything that <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>about</b> Egypt and Ethiopia. Fehling states that [...] "there is not the slightest bit of history behind the whole story" [...] about the claim of Herodotus that Pharaoh Sesostris campaigned in Europe, and that he left a colony in Colchia.|$|E
2500|$|Metcalf’s {{experience}} in libraries {{began when he}} was thirteen years old, when he worked for at the Oberlin College library. His brother-in-law, Azariah Root, was the librarian. [...] Here, he was taught how to organize the shelves and process new orders that came to the library. [...] Despite being promised pay at five cents an hour, Metcalf was never paid for his efforts. [...] <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>about</b> this oversight, “I’m inclined to believe that absent-mindedness on my employer’s part, rather than poor work on mine, was why I was never paid…but I never ventured to complain.” [...] Regardless of why he wasn’t paid, Metcalf greatly enjoyed {{what he did and}} he knew he had found his life’s work in librarianship.|$|E
2500|$|This {{coincided with}} a [...] {{determined}} effort by the British Raj to discredit the movement {{with the assistance of}} mullahs and ulema allied with the British. The British Governor, Cunningham, instructed the big khans to meet each mullah on individual basis and tell him to serve the 'cause of Islam' for which he would be duly paid. The Mullahs were told that in case of good progress they would also be considered for government pension. A Cunningham policy note of 23 September 1942 reads: 'Continuously preach the danger to Muslims of connivance with the revolutionary Hindu body. Most tribesmen seem to respond to this', while in another paper <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>about</b> the period 1939–43: 'Our propaganda {{since the beginning of the}} war had been most successful. It had played throughout on the Islamic theme.|$|E

2500|$|Within {{the last}} three decades, a number of theologians have put forward other [...] "new perspectives" [...] on Paul's {{doctrine}} of justification, and even more specifically on what <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>about</b> justification by faith. According to Simon Gathercole, [...] "Justification by faith" [...] means God accepts Gentiles in addition to Jews, since both believe in God. Paul writes {{in his letter to}} the Romans, [...] "For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from observing the law. Is God the God of Jews only? [...] Is he not the God of Gentiles too? Yes, of Gentiles too, since there is only one God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith". Faith is the central component of Paul's doctrine of justification — meaning that Gentiles don't need to become Israelites when they convert to Christianity, because God is not just the God of one nation, but Gentile and Jew alike.|$|E
2500|$|Bush was {{initially}} {{opposed to a}} potential presidential bid for her son Jeb Bush, believing that other families should have a try at the presidency and that [...] "we've had enough Bushes." [...] However, she reversed her position and appeared in a campaign ad for him. Beginning in February 2016, she was reported to begin campaigning for him in New Hampshire, an early voting state. Jeb Bush joked that {{a town hall meeting}} attended by his mother featured a larger gathering than town halls prior to her involvement. Concerning her son, she believes Jeb is nearly too well-mannered, but also is confident that he is [...] "decent and honest, and everything we need in a president." [...] Bush weighed in on Jeb's rival for the nomination, Donald Trump, by her own admission not understanding how women [...] "can vote for someone who said what he said about Megyn Kelly". She also indicated that she had tired of Trump {{over the course of the}} campaign and due to her gender, she was [...] "not crazy about what <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>about</b> women." [...] During the CBS Republican debate in February 2016, Jeb defended his mother by saying she [...] "is the strongest woman I know", to which Trump replied that Barbara Bush [...] "should be running." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prior to obtaining {{his record}} deal, Mika sent demos to many record {{companies}} in Britain, but was never signed. One record label in particular claimed that Mika {{had a good}} voice, but insisted he write more conventional songs like Robbie Williams {{in order to become}} more commercial. Mika rejected this advice. [...] The song [...] "Grace Kelly" [...] was inspired by these problems. In 2006 Mika signed with Island Records and began recording his debut album. His musical influences are based in classical music. Before Mika released his debut album he promised the media that [...] "It was a magical world that you could live in. A parallel universe for people that is illusory and enchanting and amazing." [...] Some songs on the album are sexually ambiguous, prompting some questioning regarding Mika's sexuality. On this, Mika comments that he has no taboos about what he can use to tell a story or what stories he can actually tell. He believes that sexualizing music is great, but politically sexualizing music and making the artist's sexuality the defining point of someone's music is [...] "boring". <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>about</b> his own sexuality: [...] "...laying myself out on the table to almost a tabloid level and kind of sharing my entire personal life, I'm really not into that." [...] The songs on the album have different subjects. [...] "Grace Kelly", as stated before, is about the struggle of getting a record deal. Mika stated that the song is a very important song on the album mostly because:"...it's a flagpole for the record in terms of lyrical content and the whole pop vision I wanted to get across." [...] The cover for the album and booklet was designed by Mika's sister, Yasmine, who works under the pen name DaWack, Richard Hogg and Mika himself. In March 2007 the album was released in the United States. Before its release there was much publicity about the album, mainly due to its success in Europe. Mika commented on the hype by saying: [...] "I think I'm lucky. Hype can be good and hype can be bad. The good thing that's happening to me is that the hype is about the project, it's about the music ... I'm not the son of anyone famous, I haven't really slept with anyone particularly well known ... it's really just about music, and that's something I think is very healthy." ...|$|E
