5|$|Hitler {{lived with}} his half-niece, Geli Raubal, in an {{apartment}} at Prinzregentenplatz 16 in Munich from 1929 until her death. On 18 September 1931 Raubal {{was found dead in}} the apartment with a gunshot wound, an apparent suicide with Hitler's pistol. Hitler was in Nuremberg at the time. The relationship—likely the most intense of his life—had been <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> Hitler began seeing more of Braun after Raubal's suicide.|$|E

5|$|In Tokyo, after Kaoru learns about Yukishiro Enishi's {{plans to}} kill {{everyone}} connected to Kenshin she teaches Yahiko the ougi of the Kamiya Kasshin. Enishi {{says that his}} {{goal is not to}} kill Kenshin, but to make him suffer by killing the person most important to him: Kaoru. He kidnaps her, leaving a replica of her dead body. Convinced that he again failed to save the one who was most <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> Kenshin flees to the Fallen Village and falls into a catatonic depression. When he learns that Kaoru is alive, he and the group rescue her from Enishi. They marry and have a son, Himura Kenji.|$|E

5|$|On August 6, 1787, the {{convention}} received a tentative draft {{written by a}} Committee of Detail chaired by South Carolina's John Rutledge; Randolph had represented Virginia. The draft was acceptable to Mason {{as a basis for}} discussion, containing such points <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> as the requirement that money bills originate in the House and not be amendable in the Senate. Nevertheless, Mason felt the upper house was too powerful, as it had the powers to make treaties, appoint Supreme Court justices, and adjudicate territorial disputes between the states. The draft lacked provision for a council of revision, something Mason and others considered a serious lack.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he learned}} his {{repertoire}} {{by listening to}} elders perform traditional pieces, Rakoto Frah often performed personalized variations and interpreted the traditional airs in original ways. The themes addressed in his songs ranged from serious to light-hearted and could touch on social concerns, behavior and the description of places. Rakoto Frah used both traditional flutes and those he crafted himself using diverse locally available materials. These included flutes crafted from sections of metal ski poles, PVC pipes and plastic curtain rods. He was never known to be without a flute and was widely respected for his musical virtuosity and his kindness alike. Rakoto Frah described music {{the most important element}} of life, even more <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> than his own family. Over the course of his career, the artist produced more than 800pieces of instrumental and vocal music.|$|E
5|$|The 1980 {{election}} saw the Republicans capture {{not just}} the presidency but control of the Senate as well, and Kennedy was in the minority party {{for the first time}} in his career. Kennedy did not dwell upon his presidential loss, but instead reaffirmed his public commitment to American liberalism. He chose to become the ranking member of the Labor and Public Welfare Committee rather than of the Judiciary Committee, which he would later say was one of the most important decisions of his career. Kennedy became a committed champion of women's issues and of gay rights, and established relationships with select Republican senators to block Reagan's actions and preserve and improve the Voting Rights Act, funding for AIDS treatment, and equal funding for women's sports under Title IX. To combat being in the minority, he worked long hours and devised a series of hearings-like public forums to which he could invite experts and discuss topics <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> Kennedy could not hope to stop all of Reagan's reshapings of government, but was often nearly the sole effective Democrat battling him.|$|E

5|$|As Belle {{is walking}} down the road, she runs into The Evil Queen (Lana Parrilla), who asks her if she is running from someone. Belle admits the man she is leaving is {{overcome}} by evil yet she loves him. The Evil Queen offers the solution: true love's kiss will break the curse. Belle returns to Rumpelstiltskin's castle and the Dark one asks why {{she came back to}} him. She replies that she wasn't going to return but something changed her mind. After a moment of silence between the two, they both share true love's kiss, the magic starts to turn him back into an ordinary man, but becomes furious and shakes off the magic, accusing Belle of conspiring with The Evil Queen. Rumpelstiltskin yells in a rage that no one will love him, and The Evil Queen will never take away his power. He throws Belle in his dungeon and smashes every cup against the wall but he cannot bring himself to destroy the chipped one. Once he has cooled off, he tells Belle to leave because his powers are more <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> than she is. Belle admonishes him for not believing she can love him. She warns him that he will regret his actions when all he has is an empty heart and a chipped cup.|$|E
5|$|In 1623, while near Gdańsk (Danzig), he {{witnessed}} the arrogant attitude of Gustavus Adolphus, whose navy took opportunity of its sea superiority to demand concessions from Gdańsk (the Commonwealth had no navy). In 1624 king Sigismund {{decided that the}} time had come for Władysław to travel, like many of his peers, to Western Europe. For security reasons, Władysław traveled under a fake name, Snopkowski (from Polish Snopek, meaning , as seen in the Vasa's coat of arms). In his voyage (1624–1625) he was accompanied by Albrycht Stanisław Radziwiłł and other, less notable courtiers. First, he travelled to Wrocław (Breslau), then Munich, where he met Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria. In Brussels he met Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain; in Antwerp, Rubens. Near Breda he met Ambrosio Spinola. It was during his stay with Spinola that he was impressed by Western military techniques; this was later reflected when he became king, as military matters were always <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> While not a military genius, and surpassed by his contemporary, Commonwealth hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski, Władysław was known as a fairly skillful commander on his own. In Rome he was welcomed by Pope Urban VIII, who congratulated him on his fighting against the Ottomans. During his stay in Florence he was impressed by opera, and decided to bring this form of art to the Commonwealth, where it was previously unknown. In Genoa and Venice he was impressed by the local shipyards, and in Pisa {{he witnessed}} a specially organized mock naval battle, experiences that resulted in his later attempt to create the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Navy.|$|E
5|$|On 10 March 1936, {{the pianist}} John Tobin gave a {{performance}} of Pars prima from Opus clavicembalisticum. This performance was highly inadequate, as it lasted {{twice as long as}} it should have. Sorabji left before it finished, and later denied having attended it. He gave his last public performance of his music on 16 December 1936 in Glasgow, when he premiered his Piano Toccata No. 2, and afterwards withdrew from the concert platform {{for the rest of his}} life. He later banned unauthorised performances of his music, but it remains unclear when he did so; Paul Rapoport has argued that it was probably in 1938 or 1939, but Sorabji's first announcement of it dates from 1944. Although the ban was not legally enforceable, Sorabji presented it so sharply and decisively that, for the most part, he achieved his aim. The shift in Sorabji's attitude to public performances of his music has generally been ascribed to Tobin's performance, but this explanation has also been described as simplistic. Apart from misleading reviews of his works by music critics, the deaths of people who were <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> (Busoni, Warlock, and Bernard van Dieren), the silence of Sibelius, the changes in Szymanowski's style, and the increasing prominence of Stravinsky and the late Schoenberg have all been put forward as catalysts for his decision to isolate himself from the world of music. The financial implications of his father's death have also been cited as an important factor.|$|E

25|$|Some {{classical}} rabbinical sources {{argue that}} Joseph identified himself for other reasons. In these sources, Benjamin swore an oath, on {{the memory of}} Joseph, that he was innocent of theft, and, when challenged about how believable the oath would be, explained that remembering Joseph was so <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> that he had named his sons in Joseph's honour. These sources go on to state that Benjamin's oath touched Joseph so deeply that Joseph was {{no longer able to}} pretend to be a stranger.|$|E
25|$|Philosophy {{proved to}} be unsatisfying, {{offering}} assurance {{about the use of}} reason but none about loving God, which to Luther was more important. Reason could not lead men to God, he felt, and he thereafter developed a love-hate relationship with Aristotle over the latter's emphasis on reason. For Luther, reason could be used to question men and institutions, but not God. Human beings could learn about God only through divine revelation, he believed, and Scripture therefore became increasingly <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
25|$|Music {{remained}} <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> however. Sutgof's {{daughter was}} also a pupil of Gerke, and Mussorgsky was allowed to attend lessons with her. His skills as a pianist made him much in demand by fellow-cadets; for them he would play dances interspersed with his own improvisations. In 1856 Mussorgsky – who had developed {{a strong interest in}} history and studied German philosophy – graduated from the Cadet School. Following family tradition he received a commission with the Preobrazhensky Regiment, the foremost regiment of the Russian Imperial Guard.|$|E
