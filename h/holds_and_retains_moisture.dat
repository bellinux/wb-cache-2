25|$|The Bangladeshi wickets {{receive a}} lot of rain fall in little time which {{reflects}} the soggy nature. The conditions vary from grounds like Sher-e-Bangla Cricket Stadium and Chittagong Divisional Stadium. The basic idea of producing wickets in Bangladesh is to avoid using grassroots when they are building up the layers of soil. The roots <b>hold</b> the water <b>and</b> <b>retain</b> <b>moisture</b> for an extended period. It helps bind the wicket better, making it a harder surface eventually. It also slows the process of wearing down.|$|R

50|$|If Chengal {{is used as}} a boat deck, it is {{extremely}} durable and requires very little maintenance. But it shrinks more than Teak and the deck will therefore develop more leaks and due to its hardness a Chengal deck will be relatively slippery, developing a marble like surface. Chengal decks should only be washed with salt water, and recaulked when needed. This cleans the deck, and prevents it from drying out and the wood from shrinking.

It is a rare component of the sparse vegetation community characteristic of the inland cliffs which rise above the rainforest of the terraces, and it has not been recorded from the other vegetation zones of the island.

5000|$|Inherent vice is [...] "the {{quality of}} a {{material}} or an object to self-destruct or to be unusually difficult to maintain". Paper, books, manuscripts, and ephemera are prime examples of this. Early paper was handmade from plant fibers such as flax, hemp, and cotton: it is generally durable and can last for centuries. However, in the mid-19th century, machine-made paper was introduced, and wood became the most common, least expensive ingredient, especially in newspapers. The presence of lignin in wood pulp paper causes acid to degrade the cellulose, which causes the paper to become unstable and discolored over time. In addition, paper has the natural ability to absorb <b>and</b> <b>retain</b> <b>moisture</b> from the atmosphere, making it prone {{to the growth of}} mold, fungi, and bacteria.|$|R

50|$|Teak is {{also used}} {{extensively}} in boat decks, as it is extremely durable and requires very little maintenance. The teak tends to wear in to the softer 'summer' growth bands first, forming a natural 'non-slip' surface. Any sanding is therefore only damaging. Use of modern cleaning compounds, oils or preservatives will shorten {{the life of the}} teak, as it contains natural teak-oil a very small distance below the white surface. Wooden boat experts will only wash the teak with salt water, and re-caulk when needed. This cleans the deck, and prevents it from drying out and the wood shrinking. The salt helps it absorb <b>and</b> <b>retain</b> <b>moisture,</b> <b>and</b> prevents any mildew and algal growth.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} {{moisture}} transport in porous medium of quartz sandstone. Capillary water and its movement {{is crucial for}} processes such as salt and frost weathering, growth of organisms and development of honeycombs and tafone. However, moisture transport is still not well described. I focused particularly on two new methods applied to sandstone investigation. In the laboratory I studied moisture transport in sandstone samples by means of repeated injection of uranine solution. I observed the evolution of evaporation front based on the changes in solution concentration indicated by difference in color of uranine solution. Additionally I investigated moisture content in the shallow subsurface of sandstone outcrops in the field using suction pressure and moisture content measurements by microtensiometers and TDR in three locations in the Bohemian Cretaceous Basin. Uranine {{proved to be an}} excellent tracer for visualization of the evaporation front geometry and its evolution in time. The results suggest that moisture transport is considerably affected by the presence of biofilms which are hydrophobic <b>and</b> <b>retain</b> <b>moisture</b> transport to surface. In addition, the values of suction pressure measured in honeycombs and a tafone are in agreement with the salt weathering model proposed by Huinink et al. (2004) ...|$|R
