5|$|Character {{movement}} is fully functional within the three-dimensional field map. Characters {{are able to}} perform special maneuvers using the environment by pressing the Triangle button. Traps {{with a variety of}} ill <b>effects</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> found throughout the arena. Characters' equipment can be customized, and they can gain EXP and gil from battles.|$|E
5|$|Chiral phases {{usually have}} a helical {{twisting}} of the molecules. If the pitch of this twist is {{on the order of}} the wavelength of visible light, then interesting optical interference <b>effects</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> observed. The chiral twisting that occurs in chiral LC phases also makes the system respond differently from right- and left-handed circularly polarized light. These materials can thus be used as polarization filters.|$|E

5|$|Many later {{attempts}} to draft constitutional forms of government trace their lineage back to Magna Carta. The British dominions, Australia and New Zealand, Canada (except Quebec), and formerly the Union of South Africa and Southern Rhodesia, reflected {{the influence of}} Magna Carta in their laws, and the Charter's <b>effects</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> seen in the laws of other states that evolved from the British Empire.|$|E
5|$|Halley has {{probably}} been in its current orbit for 16,000–200,000 years, {{although it is not}} possible to numerically integrate its orbit for more than a few tens of apparitions, and close approaches before 837 AD can only be verified from recorded observations. The non-gravitational <b>effects</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> crucial; as Halley approaches the Sun, it expels jets of sublimating gas from its surface, which knock it very slightly off its orbital path. These orbital changes cause delays in its perihelion of four days, average.|$|E
5|$|Patellar luxation, {{also known}} as luxating patella, is a {{hereditary}} disorder affecting the knees. It is where the kneecap slips off the groove on which it normally sits. The <b>effects</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> temporary with the dog running while holding its hind leg in the air before running on it again once the kneecap slipped back into place as if nothing has happened. Dogs can {{have a problem with}} both rear knees, and complications can include arthritis or torn knee ligaments. Severe cases can require surgery.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} {{literature}} on Parrondo's paradox, it was debated whether the word 'paradox' {{is an appropriate}} description given that the Parrondo <b>effect</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> understood in mathematical terms. The 'paradoxical' <b>effect</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> mathematically {{explained in terms of}} a convex linear combination.|$|R
25|$|The McGurk <b>effect</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{observed}} {{when the}} listener {{is also the}} speaker or articulator. While looking at oneself {{in the mirror and}} articulating visual stimuli while listening to another auditory stimulus, a strong McGurk <b>effect</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> observed. In the other condition, where the listener speaks auditory stimuli softly while watching another person articulate the conflicting visual gestures, a McGurk <b>effect</b> <b>can</b> still <b>be</b> seen, although it is weaker.|$|R

5|$|The {{main effects}} of {{tropical}} cyclones include heavy rain, strong wind, large storm surges at landfall, and tornadoes. The destruction from a tropical cyclone depends mainly on its intensity, its size, and its location. Tropical cyclones act to remove forest canopy as well as change the landscape near coastal areas, by moving and reshaping sand dunes and causing extensive erosion along the coast. Even well inland, heavy rainfall can lead to mudslides and landslides in mountainous areas. Their <b>effects</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> sensed over time by studying the concentration of the Oxygen-18 isotope within caves within the vicinity of cyclones' paths being very hazardous to people's life.|$|E
5|$|The {{wide range}} of psychoactive <b>effects</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{variously}} described as depressant, sedative-hypnotic, psychedelic, dissociative, and deliriant; paradoxical effects such as stimulation may occur however. Perceptual phenomena such as synesthesia, macropsia, and micropsia may occur. Some users report lucid dreaming {{under the influence of}} its hypnotic effects. Unlike Psilocybe cubensis, A.muscaria cannot be commercially cultivated, due to its mycorrhizal relationship with the roots of pine trees. However, following the outlawing of psilocybin mushrooms in the United Kingdom in 2006, the sale of the still legal A.muscaria began increasing.|$|E
5|$|Enemies, {{encountered}} in environments as icons, react differently {{depending on how}} they are approached and attacked: using the right attack or approaching them unawares grants the party an advantage in battle. If other groups of enemies are close by, they are also drawn into the initiated battle. For both player characters and enemies, battle skills and character performance can be affected by elemental attributes. Status ailments can also be inflicted by both the party and enemies. They are divided into physical ailments and magical ailments, which {{have a variety of}} negative effects: physical <b>effects</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> effects like slowing or poisoning a character, while magical ailments can cause units to turn on their allies or automatically recover a knocked-out party member. Items used on characters can restore TP or HP, or remove status ailments. Characters learn new skills during battles, along with Titles that affect aspects of characters.|$|E

5|$|Fishermen of the Canary Islands had {{to return}} to and remain in port for several days while {{weathering}} the storm, and this disruption was blamed for a 10–15% reduction of the islands' tuna catch. Tropical Storm Delta also had some further-reaching effects. The political opposition Popular Party challenged that the impact of Tropical Storm Delta proved the need for the island to prepare an emergency plan to deal with natural and man-made disasters. Only five of the island's many municipalities had an emergency plan, and there was no coordination across the entire island chain. Delta also served to highlight the islands' aging power grid, prompting the regional director general of industry and energy to consider building another power plant on the archipelago. The storm sparked a vigorous debate on the island about the effects of global climate change, how they will affect the islands, and how these <b>effects</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> avoided.|$|E
5|$|Humans evolved {{for life}} in Earth gravity, and {{exposure}} to weightlessness {{has been shown to}} have deleterious effects on the health of the human body. Initially, more than 50% of astronauts experience space motion sickness. This can cause nausea and vomiting, vertigo, headaches, lethargy, and overall malaise. The duration of space sickness varies, but it typically lasts for 1–3 days, after which the body adjusts to the new environment. Longer term exposure to weightlessness results in muscle atrophy and deterioration of the skeleton, or spaceflight osteopenia. These <b>effects</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> minimized through a regimen of exercise. Other effects include fluid redistribution, slowing of the cardiovascular system, decreased production of red blood cells, balance disorders, and a weakening of the immune system. Lesser symptoms include loss of body mass, nasal congestion, sleep disturbance, and puffiness of the face.|$|E
5|$|Morpholinos {{have become}} a {{standard}} knockdown tool in animal embryonic systems, which have {{a broader range of}} gene expression than adult cells and can be strongly affected by an off-target interaction. Following initial injections into frog or fish embryos at the single-cell or few-cell stages, Morpholino <b>effects</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> measured up to five days later, after most of the processes of organogenesis and differentiation are past, with observed phenotypes consistent with target-gene knockdown. Control oligos with irrelevant sequences usually produce no change in embryonic phenotype, evidence of the Morpholino oligo's sequence-specificity and lack of non-antisense effects. The dose required for a knockdown can be reduced by coinjection of several Morpholino oligos targeting the same mRNA, which is an effective strategy for reducing or eliminating dose-dependent off-target RNA interactions.|$|E
