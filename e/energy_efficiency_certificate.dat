40|$|End-use energy {{efficiency}} {{is a measure}} of the level of end-use energy services (eg heating, cooling, lighting or motive power) that can be delivered per unit of energy ‘consumed’. Energy services and hence efficiency can be difficult to define. Nevertheless, improvements in end-use {{energy efficiency}} will play a vital role in any effective and economically efficient response to climate change. Policy intervention is required because many energy efficiency benefits are market externalities, and because there are widespread market failures in end-use decision making – many energy users fail to undertake even cost-effective efficiency options. Unfortunately, there are many complexities and challenges for such policy making. In particular, the ability to improve energy efficiency, and the costs and benefits from doing so, are often spread between many players including infrastructure providers, equipment manufacturers, service providers and owners as well as the actual energy users. There is growing worldwide interest in market-based policy mechanisms. It is argued that they can offer a ‘one size fits all ’ approach with economic efficiency advantages over regulation. For example, <b>Energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>Certificate</b> Trading (EECT) combines certificates (typically representing one MWh of ‘energy savings ’ from increased efficiency) with market based trading between parties having ‘obligations ’ and other parties creating ‘energy savings’.

40|$|The Building Energy Efficiency Disclosure Bill (‘the Bill’) {{provides}} {{for the establishment of}} a new national scheme for the disclosure of commercial office building energy efficiency. Phasing in a national scheme for the disclosure of commercial building energy efficiency was agreed to by the Council of Australian Governments on 2 July 2009 under the National Strategy on Energy Efficiency. The parameters of an initial scheme for office buildings were subsequently agreed to by the Ministerial Council on Energy on 2 November 2009, including that the scheme be enacted through Commonwealth legislation. The scheme will require the disclosure of information about the energy efficiency of large commercial office buildings at the point of sale, lease and sublease. The information to be disclosed will be in the form of a building <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>certificate</b> (BEEC). A BEEC will have three components: an energy efficiency star rating for the office building; information about the energy efficiency of the office lighting; and generic guidance on how the energy efficiency of the office may be improved.

The applicable energy efficiency star rating must be disclosed in any advertisement for the sale, lease or sublease of an office. The scheme will provide the commercial office market with credible information about the relative energy efficiency of offices that are for sale, lease and sublease.

40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} commitments, {{often associated}} with tradable energy efficiency certificates, dubbed "white certificates", were recently implemented in the United Kingdom and Italy and will soon start in France. Energy suppliers have to fund a given quantity of energy efficiency measures, or to buy "white certificates" from other suppliers who exceed their target. We develop a partial equilibrium model to compare white certificates to other policy instruments for energy efficiency, i. e., taxes and standards. Our conclusions are: First, if white certificates are chosen, each supplier's target should be set {{as a percentage of}} the energy they sell during the commitment period rather than in absolute terms, e. g. based on past variables. Indeed the latter solution decreases sharply energy suppliers' profit since they cannot pass the cost of certificate generation on to consumers. Such a system thus risks generating a fierce opposition from these industries. Furthermore, setting individual targets independently of the evolution of market shares seems unfair. At last, this system risks creating a large rebound effect, i. e., a large increase in energy services consumption. Second, compared to taxes and standards, white certificates (with targets in percentage of energy sold) seem particularly interesting to reach a certain level of energy savings while limiting distributional effects, thus to limit oppositions to its implementation. Furthermore, they generate less rebound effect than standards and seem more able than taxes to mobilise a part of the no regret potential. However if targets are too weak there is a real risk that white certificates systems fund mostly business-as-usual energy efficiency activities, thus having little impact while delaying the implementation of other policy instruments.

40|$|Sustainability {{has been}} a major factor and {{determinant}} of commercial property design, construction, retro-fitting and landlord and tenant requirements over the last decade, supported by the introduction of rating tools such as NABERS and GreenStar and the recently mandated Building <b>Energy</b> <b>Efficiency</b> <b>Certificate</b> (BEEC). However, the movement to sustainable and energy efficient housing has not been established for the same period, and although mandatory building regulations have been in place for new residential housing construction since 2004, the requirement to improve the sustainability and energy efficiency of housing constructed prior to 2004 has not been mandatory. Residential dwelling energy efficiency and rating schemes introduced in Australia over the past decade have included rating schemes such as BASIX, NatHERS, First rate, ACTHERS, and Building Code of Australia and these have applied to new dwelling construction. At both National and State level the use of energy efficiency schemes for existing residential dwellings has been voluntary and despite significant cash incentives have not always been successful or achieved widespread take-up. In 2010, the Queensland Government regulated that all homes offered for sale, whether a new or existing dwellings require the seller to provide a ―sustainability declaration‖ that provides details of the sustainability measures associated with the dwelling being sold. The purpose of this declaration being to inform buyers and increase community awareness of home sustainability features. This paper uses an extensive review of real estate marketing material, together with a comprehensive survey of real estate agents to analyse the current market compliance, awareness and acceptance of existing green housing regulations and the importance that residential property owners and purchasers place on energy efficient and sustainable housing.

30|$|Energy {{management}} in energy-intensive {{industries such as}} foundries {{is a very important}} and actual topic. New standards were developed to help the organizations to implement an effective energy management system, the most widely applied is ISO 50001 : 2011 —Energy Management System. To correctly implement an energy management system, {{the first step is to}} conduct an energy audit that is a survey that examines the ways energy is currently used in the facility, also identifying some alternatives for reducing energy costs. Recently, new standards have been developed in this subject (the UNI CEI EN 16247 —Energy audits set and, in Italy, the UNI CEI TR 11428 —Diagnosi energetiche). The philosophy behind those standards is common: to pass from a “passive” vision (where the cost of energy is unavoidable and uncontrollable) to an “active” vision (where the cost of energy not only is under control, but moreover it is planned and can give an added value). Concerning the last point, in Italy an <b>Energy</b> <b>Efficiency</b> <b>Certificates</b> system is operating since 2004 : every energy saving intervention in industries or organizations produces the certificates (each is worth 1 toe) that can be sold in a dedicated market (at a variable economic value, actually it is nearly 110 EUR) to the parties bound to <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> interventions (typically electricity and natural gas distributors).|$|R
40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of Commercial Building Disclosure, buildings&# 039; physical performance is more than building grades {{and has become a}} highly relevant issue in building sales and leases activities and of property market participants.

Although {{the introduction}} of Commercial Building Disclosure {{has not been able to}} drive the existing office owners to fully or partially refurbish their buildings, it does not mean that the impact of Commercial Building Disclosure is not significant. The importance of Commercial Building Disclosure is that it will help to narrow the information inequality between office owners and tenants as a third - party energy certification system.

Two online surveys were conducted in February 2015 to examine the gaps in information and skills held by housing industry representatives to support increased sales and rentals of low carbon (‘energy efficient’) homes. The aim of the housing construction specialist survey was to identify the demand and knowledge held by the housing sector in energy efficient features, perspectives held by specialists regarding energy efficiency standards and rating systems, preferred information sources and gaps of information regarding housing energy efficiency, and related industry knowledge and training. Respondents’ demographic and socio-economic data were also collected. The online survey of real estate agents and property managers explored which features were perceived as important overall and which contributed to energy efficiency, whether – and how- the energy efficiency-related features were actively promoted during engagement with potential buyers and tenants, how information could be presented to maximise uptake, the perceived barriers to marketing energy efficiency housing features, the interest in ‘leading’ promotion of energy efficient housing, the existing knowledge of home energy rating tools and information systems, gaps in training to build familiarity with energy efficient housing. The survey of housing construction specialists received 492 responses, from across Australia - with the most responses from Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland.

This report {{presents the results}} from a national telephone survey of consumers about understanding what information, from what sources at what time, and in what form is required to drive market uptake of low carbon homes. In total, {{a random sample of}} 866 Australians was interviewed for this survey. Respondents represented all Australian states and territories in proportions comparable to the Australian Bureau of Statistics Census data (2011). Results indicate respondents have a strong interest in energy efficient (EE) homes and their associated lower running costs, and that such homes are regarded as a priority, possible to achieve and not a hassle. Promoting key EE features, namely ceiling insulation, natural light, EE lighting, EE heating systems, and EE air conditioning, would likely be well-received by prospective buyers and tenants. EE homes were seen as providing comfort if they were cool in summer and warm in winter, had natural light, had good airflow/ventilation and were quiet. Therefore, promoting these features could increase the association of comfort with EE homes. The environmental benefits of EE homes were highlighted as motivating a decision and likely to elicit a response to buy or lease a home, especially if they were seen as popularly supported. Respondents were willing to pay for specific energy efficiency information about their prospective home, with about one third of respondents willing to pay $ 100 or more for information, although, respondents placed more emphasis on information on upfront costs than longer term running costs. Respondents indicated their preferred timing for feature-specific information when buying or renting was in the building inspection report, at ‘open for inspection’ events, and in home sales/rental advertising. Their preferred channels of information were via friends and family, product brochures, browsing at hardware stores, and use of energy ratings tools...|$|E
40|$|In {{real estate}} markets where <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>certificates</b> are not mandatory, such as Santiago in Chile, {{incorporating}} solutions that {{respond to the}} growing demand for sustainability entails a natural tension between their acceptance as necessary measures {{and the way they}} are addressed by the market.

Their positioning was more evident in higher-value homes, where they were identified as consolidated attributes, while they are considered innovations {{at the lower end of}} the market. However, as evidence suggests, sustainability attributes decline in relative importance over time, ceasing to be considered marks of distinction. This suggests that this model should be reviewed from a public policy perspective, with the understanding that the current voluntary standards must compete with other attributes.

Then, Italy adopted two ministerial decrees: the ministerial decree of Environment Ministry (August 4, 2011), that integrates the Decree n. 20, and the ministerial decree of Ministry of Economic Development (September 5, 2011), that lays down the conditions and procedures for access to the support system of cogeneration: for each year in which the requirements of high efficiency cogeneration are met, the cogeneration units are entitled to <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>certificates</b> (White Certificates), whose number is proportional to the energy saving achieved. Therefore, from January 1, 2011 the legislative and incentive cogeneration context is radically changed and, consequently, new boundary conditions {{must be taken into account}} for feasibility studies and performance assessments of cogeneration plants. So, in this paper we want to evaluate the impact of this new legislative context on the competitiveness of the various cogeneration technologies.

40|$|The EU Directive 2004 / 8 /EC, {{concerning}} {{the promotion of}} cogeneration, established principles on how EU member states can support {{combined heat and power}} generation (CHP). Up to now, the implementation of these principles into national law has not been uniform, and has led to the adoption of different promotion schemes for CHP across the EU member states. In this paper, we first give an overview of the promotion schemes for CHP in various European countries. In a next step, we take two standard CHP technologies, combined-cycle gas turbines (CCGT-CHP) and engine-CHP, and apply exemplarily four selected support mechanisms used in the four largest European energy markets: feed-in tariffs in Germany; <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>certificates</b> in Italy; benefits through tax reduction in the UK; and purchase obligations for power from CHP generation in France. For contracting companies, it could be of interest to diversify their investment in new CHP facilities regionally over several countries in order to reduce country and regulatory risk. By applying Mean-Variance Portfolio (MVP) theory, we derive characteristic return-risk profiles of the selected CHP technologies in different countries. The results show that the returns on CHP investments differ significantly depending on the country, the support scheme, and the selected technology studied. While a regional diversification of investments in CCGT-CHP does not contribute to reducing portfolio risks, a diversification of investments in engine-CHP can decrease the risk exposure.

The strengths and limits of the Italian White Certificates mechanism will be examined, considering its i portance as a market-based tool in national energy policy.

40|$|White Certificate schemes are {{currently}} being implemented or proposed in {{a growing number of}} jurisdictions as a means to drive greater <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> uptake. After briefly discussing some of {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} such schemes, this paper outlines a proposed alternative approach [...] the use of Energy Sales Targets. This approach essentially involves the imposition of a cap on the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with annual energy sales and, in its simplest version, requires no tradeable certificates or permits. The proposed approach creates a clear measurable link between how compliance is enforced (the retailers' targets) and the desired outcomes of the scheme (measurable reductions in GHG emissions). This drives physical additionality of the scheme, including negation of any rebound effect within the covered sectors. It also avoids the need to define the activities eligible to create certificates, and likewise, no deeming, auditing, monitoring or verification would be required by government beyond ensuring retailer compliance [...] significantly reducing administration costs. There does not appear to be a clear precedent for this type of scheme anywhere in the world, and so this paper should be seen as a preliminary scoping of options that are deserving of more in-depth assessment. <b>Energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> White <b>Certificate</b> <b>Energy</b> sales targets...|$|R

40|$|The {{widespread}} {{adoption of}} {{combined heat and power}} generation is {{widely recognized as}} a strategic goal to achieve significant primary energy savings and lower carbon dioxide emissions. In this context, the purpose of this research is to evaluate the potential of cogeneration based on reciprocating gas engines for some Italian hospital buildings. Comparative analyses have been conducted based on the load profiles of two specific hospital facilities and through the study of the cogeneration system-user interaction. To this end, a specific methodology has been set up by coupling a specifically developed calculation algorithm to a genetic optimization algorithm, and a multi-objective approach has been adopted. The results from the optimization problem highlight a clear trade-off between total primary energy savings (TPES) and simple payback period (SPB). Optimized plant configurations and management strategies show TPES exceeding 18 % for the reference hospital facilities and multi–gas engine solutions along with a minimum SPB of approximately three years, thereby justifying the European regulation promoting cogeneration. However, designing a CHP plant for a specific energetic, legislative or market scenario does not guarantee good performance when these scenarios change. For this reason, the proposed methodology has been enhanced in order to focus on some innovative aspects. In particular, this study proposes an uncommon and effective approach to identify the most stable plant solutions through a multi-objective robust design optimization. In particular, the sensitivity of the expected results to possible difficulties in finding commercially available CHP gas engines with sizes reasonably close to the optimal numerical solutions has been estimated. The results indicate that the economic sensitivity is often higher than the energetic sensitivity for most of the optimal solutions, with standard deviation accounting up to 7 % of its mean value for the SPB, whereas that percentage is always under 3 % for the TPES. Furthermore, the research highlights how the expected results obtained through a deterministic definition of the input decision variables could be overestimated compared to the robust design approach. The proposed research also highlights how optimized CHP plants can be characterized by reasonable levels of energetic and economic sensitivity to changes in the following variable quantities: selling price of electricity, reference efficiency of the Italian thermoelectric generation and selling price of the <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> <b>certificates</b> recognized by the Italian legislation. Indeed, Pareto optimal solutions indicate that the standard deviation for the SPB is always less than 3. 5 % of its mean value, while this percentage is always under 7 % for the TPES...|$|R

Examples: change light bulbs, tune-up a heating boiler, replace pumps. <b>Energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> programme: A specific activity (e. g. targeted information, free energy audits, rebates for energy-efficient equipment, direct installation of efficient equipment [...] .) taken by energy companies and other market actors, and targeted to energy end-users or market agents (e. g., manufacturers or retailers of energy-consuming products). <b>Energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> programmes typically combine information, advice, training of technology providers, and possible a financial incentive to the customer. In contrast to <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> services, <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> programmes are activi-ties not directly {{paid for by the}} customer or market agent who directly benefits.

Using {{data from the}} German and Colombian Annual Surveys of Industries from 1998 to 2005, the analysis compares <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> performances in German and Colombian NEISs at two levels of aggregation and then applies several alternative models. The results show considerable variation in <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> performance in the NEISs of both countries. Comparing the results across models, {{it was found that}} in the German and Colombian NEISs, the measures of <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> are similar, indicating that an appropriate combination of technical efficiency and cost minimisation are necessary to improve <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency.</b> However, <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> based on cost minimisation is greater in both countries, demonstrating that energy prices in this sector are not the key variable for improving <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency.</b> This is due to the low share of energy costs, making it preferable to change other inputs rather than energy. A second-stage regression analysis reveals that in the German and Colombian NEISs, labour productivity and investments are fundamental to changes in <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Finally, the <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> measures of the DEA models show significant correlations with the traditional <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> measure, indicating that <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> as measured through DEA could be complementary to measures of energy intensity when analysing other key elements of <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> performance in the industrial sector. <b>Energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> - German non-energy intensive sectors - Colombian non-energy intensive sectors...|$|R

Sustainable development demands new strategies, solutions, and policy-making approaches. Numerous studies of <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> potential state that cost-effective <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> technologies in industry are not always implemented for various reasons, such as lack of information, procedural impediments, and routines not favoring <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Another reason for the efficiency gap is the existence of particular values, unsupportive of <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency,</b> in the dominant networks of a branch of trade. Analysis indicates that different sectors of rather closed communities have established their own tacit knowledge, perceived truths, and routines concerning <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> measures. Actors in different industrial sectors highlight different barriers to <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> and why cost-effective <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> measures are not being implemented. The identified barriers can be problematized {{in relation to the}} social context to understand their existence and how to resolve them.

We explore the total-factor <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> and change trends by applying data envelopment analysis (DEA) window, which is capable of measuring efficiency in cross-sectional and time-varying data. The empirical results indicate that Botswana, Mexico and Panama perform the best in terms of <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency,</b> whereas Kenya, Sri Lanka, Syria and the Philippines perform the worst during the entire research period. Seven countries show little change in <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency</b> over time. Eleven countries experienced continuous decreases in <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Among five countries witnessing continuous increase in total-factor <b>energy</b> <b>efficiency,</b> China experienced the most rapid rise.
