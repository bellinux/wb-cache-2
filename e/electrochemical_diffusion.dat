It is shown that {{up to a certain}} deposition time and corresponding film thickness the rate limiting step is oxygen diffusion through the substrate pores, giving a linear dependence of the film thickness on the deposition time. For longer deposition times, i. e. thicker films, a transition of the rate limiting step to bulk <b>electrochemical</b> <b>diffusion</b> in the film occurs, resulting in a parabolic dependence of the film thickness on the deposition time.

The new electrical circuit is derived from fundamental <b>electrochemical</b> and <b>diffusion</b> theory. It consists of a transmission line in combination with distributed Warburg elements. The validation {{of this study is}} divided into a theoretical validation and an experimental validation. In the theoretical validation the impedance response of the CCL generated from three different circuits reported in the literature was compared with the simulated data from the generic electrical circuit. In the experimental validation, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out in an H 2 /air PEFC through a three-electrode configuration in the measurement system and were compared with the simulated data from the generic circuit. The results show that the generic circuit is able to accurately reproduce the measured data of the CCL at different current densities and is able to represent the <b>electrochemical</b> and <b>diffusion</b> mechanisms of the CCL in the frequency domain. It is possible to generate a deeper understanding of how and where the chemical energy that is released from the redox reaction is being dissipated and retained within the real physical system...|$|R

Starting from different initial conditions, a single framework allows one to describe generalised corrosion, localised corrosion, reactive and passive surfaces, including occluded corrosion phenomena as well. Spontaneous spatial separation of anodic and cathodic zones is associated with bare metal and passivated metal on the surface. This separation is also related to local acidification of the solution. This spontaneous change {{is associated with a}} much faster corrosion rate. Material morphology is closely related to corrosion kinetics, which can be used for technological applications.

40|$|By {{means of}} {{electrochemical}} vapour deposition (EVD), {{it is possible}} to grow thin (0. 5 - 5 µm), dense zirconia/yttria layers on porous ceramic substrates. Kinetics of the EVD process, morphology and oxygen permeation properties of the grown layers are investigated. Very thin (~ 0. 5 µm) layers are grown at relatively low temperatures (700 - 800 °C). Water vapour as reactant enhances the surface reaction rate at the solid oxide/oxygen source reactant interface. A transition occurs from pore diffusion (above 1000 °C) to bulk <b>electrochemical</b> <b>diffusion</b> (below 900 °C) as rate-limiting step for layer growth. The zirconia/yttria solid solution is mainly deposited in the cubic phase; the layers grow in a typical columnar way and are polycrystalline.

40|$|This work delineates the {{mechanism}} by which directional nanowire growth occurs in the directed electrochemical nanowire assembly (DENA) technique for growing nanowires on micro-electrode arrays. Indium, polythiophene, and polypyrrole nanowires are the subjects of this study. This technique allows the user to specify the growth path {{without the use of}} a mechanical template. Nanowire growth from a user-selected electrode to within ± 3 μm of the straight line path to a second electrode lying within a ∼ 140 ◦ angular range and a ∼ 100 μm radius of the selected electrode is demonstrated. Theory for one-dimensional <b>electrochemical</b> <b>diffusion</b> in the inter-electrode region reveals that screening of the applied voltage is incomplete, allowing a long range voltage component to extend from the biased to the grounded electrode. Numerical analysis of two-dimensional multi-electrode arrays shows that a linear ridge of electric field maxima bridges the gap between selected electrodes but decays in all other directions. The presence of this anisotropic, long range voltage defines the wire growth path and suppresses the inherent tip splitting tendency of amorphous polymeric materials. This technology allows polythiophene and polypyrrole to be grown as wires rather than fractal aggregates or films, establishing DENA as an on-chip approach to both crystalline metallic and amorphous polymeric nanowire growth. 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{electrochemical}} {{behavior of}} the V() /V() and V() /V(Ш) redox couples has been studied at a graphite electrode by cyclic voltammetry in sulfuric acid solutions. The diffusion coefficient (D) and the rate constant (k) of V() /V() and V() /V(Ш) redox couples for varying state of charge (SOC) can be calculated by cyclic voltammetry. The values of Da(diffusion coefficient of anode) and ka(the rate constant of anode) are increased for V() /V() couple while decreased for V() /V(Ш) couple with increasing of SOC. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is employed to study mechanism of the two couples in sulfuric acid medium. Characteristic EIS plots with the capacitive semicircle in high frequency and the Warburg tail in low frequency are observed for the two couples, implying that both the <b>electrochemical</b> and <b>diffusion</b> process play important roles in V() /V() and V() /V(Ш) couples, the two electrode processes are controlled by both electron-transfer and mass-transfer...|$|R
40|$|Developmental {{aspects of}} taurocholate {{transport}} into ileal brush border membrane vesicles were studied in 2 -wk-old (suckling), 3 -wk-old (weanling), and 6 -wk-old (adolescent) rats. Taurocholate uptake (picomoles per milligram protein) into brush border membrane vesicles prepared from 2 -wk-old rats was similar under Na+ and K+ gradient conditions (outside greater than inside). By contrast, uptake in 3 - and 6 -wk-old rats was significantly enhanced at 20 s, and at 1, 2, and 5 min of incubation {{in the presence}} of a Na+ gradient when compared with a K+ gradient incubation (P less than 0. 05). Under isotope exchange conditions, a plot of active uptake velocity versus taurocholate concentration (0. 10 - 1. 0 mM) in 2 -wk-old rat membrane vesicles was linear and approached the horizontal axis, suggesting the absence of active transport. However, similar plots in 3 - and 6 -wk-old rats described a rectangular hyperbola, indicating a Na+-dependent, saturable cotransport system. Woolf-Augustinsson-Hofstee plots of the uptake velocity versus concentration data from 3 - and 6 -wk-old rat brush border membrane vesicles yielded Vmax values that were not significantly different, 844 and 884 pmol uptake/mg protein per 120 s, respectively. The respective Km values were 0. 59 and 0. 66 mM taurocholate. The induction of an <b>electrochemical</b> <b>diffusion</b> potential by incubating K+-loaded vesicles with valinomycin did not significantly enhance taurocholate uptake in 2 -, 3 -, or 6 -wk-old rat vesicle preparations. These data indicate that taurocholate transport into rat ileal brush border membrane vesicles is mediated by an electroneutral, sodium-coupled, cotransport system that is incompletely developed in the 2 -wk-old suckling rat but fully developed by the time of weaning at 3 wk of age...|$|E
40|$|Although pure {{electrochemical}} {{techniques can}} provide substantial knowledge about electrochemical reaction mechanisms, {{they lack the}} ability to provide direct molecular structure information about the species involved. This inability to extract molecular information can result in mechanistic ambiguity {{with respect to the}} identity of the reaction intermediates. This information can be obtained by coupling in situ spectroscopic methodologies with electrochemical techniques. This is known as spectroelectrochemistry. A particularly problematic area of study with spectroelectrochemical techniques is the analysis of the mass transport of species within the diffusion layer of the electrode. The visualization of the diffusion layer surrounding electrodes allows for the unambiguous determination of electrode processes. However, a high degree of spatial and temporal resolution is needed as the diffusion layer in a typical electrochemical reaction extends to a thickness of hundreds of microns in tens of seconds. While traditional infrared spectroelectrochemical techniques have been valuable for the study of electrochemical processes, they do not provide the spatial and/or the temporal resolution that is needed to examine the diffusion layers produced at electrodes. This thesis focuses on the development of an IR technique that couples synchrotron based IR radiation (SIR) with electrochemistry, allowing for the concentrations of species present within the diffusion layer of an electrode to be mapped during an electrochemical reaction. The reduction of ferricyanide and oxidation of hydroquinone (HQ) are used as test redox systems to study the ability of SIR to map <b>electrochemical</b> <b>diffusion</b> layers. The resulting diffusion coefficients of ferricyanide, ferrocyanide, hydroquinone and benzoquinone are extracted using the IR method developed here and compared to those determined independently by hydrodynamic linear sweep voltammetry (HLSV). The diffusion coefficients of all species as determined by SIR diffusion layer mapping will be shown to be consistent with the diffusion coefficients determined by HLSV. This validates the ability of SIR diffusion layer mapping to monitor electrochemically generated diffusion layers...|$|E

Even at 650 degrees C, the area-specific resistance was lower than 0. 5 cm(2). The microstructure of the cathode {{and the performance of}} this type of SOFC were not obviously affected by variations in the sintering temperature of the cathode.

Nanocrystalline specimens of pure nickel and of 80 %-Nickel 20 %-Iron were tested to determine the affect of intercrystalline volume on hydrogen breakthrough diffusion. Specimens of pure palladium were tested to determine the influence of entry surface roughness, cathodic charging current density, different cold working and texture conditions on hydrogen permeation. A series of permeation tests performed on nanocrystalline nickel were used to optimize the measurement conditions. Experiments performed on 80 / 20 Ni-Fe thin foils determined that the hydrogen breakthrough diffusion coefficient drops dramatically with increasing grain size in the range of 20 [...] 40 nanometers. Above 40 nanometers, the breakthrough diffusion coefficient reaches a steady-state level. This decrease in breakthrough diffusion coefficient is thought to be due to a decrease in intercrystalline volume. Tests performed on palladium showed that the hydrogen effective diffusion coefficient increased logarithmically with increasing cathodic charging current density. These experiments also demonstrated that the optimum charging current density for palladium is 0. 1 mA/cm 2. Other tests on palladium determined that the surface roughness, on the entry side of the specimens, had no influence on the effective diffusion coefficient, processing efficiency or hydrogen subsurface entry concentration.

40|$|Structural {{batteries}} are multifunctional {{materials that are}} expected to perform multiple roles, i. e. power generation and mechanical support. Properly realized, the concept can dramatically improve gravimetric properties by elimination of parasitic masses tolerated in conventional devices. However, the significant structural loads that such batteries would be expected to bear, given their multiple roles, would exceed those experienced by conventional batteries, and thus must be studied and understood in the context of device safety, lifetime and cost. Key sources of mechanical stresses were identified and quantified in this effort, including manufacturing-induced loads, thermal loads, kinetic loads and structural loads. It was found that stresses due to compression during electrode fabrication can be as large as 2000 MPa, thus having the potential to induce mechanical failure of constituent materials, while stresses induced by structural loads in an unmanned vehicle example studied, were less than 1 MPa. Thermal stresses were found in one embodiment, to exceed 100 MPa, largely due to mechanical confinement of batteries embedded for structural support. Supporting experiments were conceived in this work to study the effect of loads on electrochemical performance. A novel design of a structural battery was developed, to simultaneously conduct mechanical and <b>electrochemical</b> experiments. <b>Diffusion</b> coefficients were determined while various loadings were applied.

Statistically meaningful correlation was not observed for diffusion coefficients with respect to stresses, but forces applied to carbon fiber significantly varied during charging/discharging of batteries, and the magnitude of variance of force was strongly correlated with the number of charges. 	Molecular dynamics simulations, finally, were performed to examine findings from experiments. Diffusion coefficients of lithium ions were measured while graphite lattices were stressed.

Resistive heating was identified {{as the most important}} heat generation source. To probe the impact of the particle shape (equivalent radius and aspect ratio of an ellipsoidal particle) and the potential sweep rate on stress and heat generation, a surrogate-based analysis was also conducted. The systematic study showed that both intercalation-induced stress and time-averaged resistive heat generation rate increase with particle radius and potential sweep rate. Intercalation-induced stress increases first, then decreases as the aspect ratio of an ellipsoidal particle increases, whereas time-averaged resistive heat generation rate decreases as aspect ratio increases. This surrogate-based analysis suggests that ellipsoidal particles with larger aspect ratios are preferred over spherical particles, in improving battery performance when stress and heat generation are the only factors considered. © 2008 The Electrochemical Society...|$|R
40|$|Pattern {{formation}} {{during the}} oscillatory oxidation of H- 2 on Pt ring-electrodes {{in the presence}} of electrosorbing ions was studied under potentiostatic control for three different positions of the reference electrode (RE). The position of the RE crucially affects the degree of the global feedback which is imposed by the potentiostatic operation mode, and the three configurations selected corresponded to zero, maximum and intermediate global coupling. In the absence of global coupling, 'communication' among different positions occurs exclusively through migration coupling (the <b>electrochemical</b> counterpart to <b>diffusion</b> in reaction-diffusion systems). In this case, spatially inhomogeneous oscillations that were attributed to a spatial bifurcation of the homogeneous limit cycle were observed throughout. This implies that the system is Benjamin-Feir unstable. For the strongest global coupling adjustable, travelling pulses were found that emerged in a wave bifurcation with n = 1 from the homogeneous steady state. The pulses exhibited modulations in velocity and width that most likely resulted from the interaction between inhomogeneities of the catalytic surface and the nonlinear reaction dynamics. In the case of an intermediate global coupling strength, a diversity of spatio-temporal motions was observed. The dynamics ranged from pulses over target patterns and so-called asymmetric target patterns to mixed states where two or three of these states alternate. For some parameters these mixed states were in addition separated by bursts of the system to a nearly homogeneous unreactive state...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} {{comparative}} study of the <b>electrochemical</b> lithium <b>diffusion</b> properties within the olivine structure of LiMn 0. 5 Fe 0. 5 PO 4, LiFePO 4, and LiMnPO 4 materials prepared by the solvothermal pathway. The study includes careful analysis performed by potentiodynamic cycling with galvanostatic acceleration (PCGA), cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT), carried out in order to investigate {{the features of the}} Fe 3 +/Fe 2 + and Mn 3 +/Mn 2 + redox processes and the lithium ion transport within the olivine structure. The electrochemical investigation reveals a shift of the redox potential of Fe 3 +/Fe 2 + and Mn 3 +/Mn 2 + couples toward higher and lower values, respectively, in LiMn 0. 5 Fe 0. 5 PO 4 with respect to the bare materials. Interestingly, the study shows the dependence of the lithium diffusion coefficients on the state of charge of the materials {{as well as on the}} adopted technique. Accordingly, CV leads to lithium diffusion coefficients of the order of 10 − 12 cm 2 s− 1 for LiMnPO 4, 10 − 9 cm 2 s− 1 for LiFePO 4, and 10 − 11 cm 2 s− 1 for LiMn 0. 5 Fe 0. 5 PO 4. EIS mainly indicates lower values of lithium diffusion coefficients, i. e., 10 − 13 cm 2 s− 1 for LiMnPO 4, 10 − 12 cm 2 s− 1 for LiFePO 4, and 10 − 13 cm 2 s− 1 for LiMn 0. 5 Fe 0. 5 PO 4. GITT provides a wide range of Li+ diffusion coefficient, depending on the Li 1 −xMePO 4 stoichiometry, that is, 10 − 14 − 10 − 10 cm 2 s− 1 for LiMnPO 4 and LiFePO 4 and 10 − 13 − 10 − 10 cm 2 s− 1 for LiMn 0. 5 Fe 0. 5 PO 4. The wide diffusion coefficient window obtained by changing the state of charge and the adopted technique sheds light on the complex trend of the lithium diffusion in olivines and indicates that the technique may actually influence the materials evaluation...|$|R

In this study, an analysis of the current distribution and oxygen diffusion in the Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cell (PEFC) Cathode Catalyst Layer (CCL) has been carried out using Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. Cathode EIS measurements obtained through a three-electrode configuration in the measurement system are compared with simulated EIS data from a previously validated numerical model, which subsequently allows the diagnostics of spatio-temporal electrochemical performance of the PEFC cathode. The results show that low frequency EIS measurements commonly related to mass transport limitations are attributed to the low oxygen equilibrium concentration in the CCLeGas Diffusion Layer (GDL) interface and the low diffusivity of oxygen through the CCL. Once the <b>electrochemical</b> and <b>diffusion</b> mechanisms of the CCL are calculated from the EIS measurements, a further analysis of the current density and oxygen concentration distributions through the CCL thickness is carried out. The results show that high ionic resistance within the CCL electrolyte skews the current distribution towards the membrane interface. Therefore the same average current density has to be provided by few catalyst sites near the membrane. The increase in ionic resistance results in a poor catalyst utilization through the CCL thickness. The results also show that non-steady oxygen diffusion in the CCL allows equilibrium to be established between the equilibrium oxygen concentration supplied at the GDL boundary and the surface concentration of the oxygen within the CCL. Overall, the study newly demonstrates that the developed technique can be applied to estimate the factors that influence the nature of polarization curves and to reveal the effect of kinetic, ohmic and mass transport mechanisms on current distribution through the thickness of the CCL from experimental EIS measurements...|$|R
