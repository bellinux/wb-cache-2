5000|$|The Bootie {{featured}} a then-unique way to fold the handlebars and seat {{out of the}} way. This comprised a solid steel, two-part hinge fitted midway on the steerer and seat tubes.Each hinge was secured with a <b>hand</b> <b>nut</b> which, when loosened, allowed the upper part to be swung {{over the side of}} the frame. In the case of the steerer tube, loosening another <b>hand</b> <b>nut</b> allowed the handlebars to be rotated 90 degrees to fit snugly against the side of the bike.|$|E
50|$|This type {{is similar}} to a {{friction}} plate clutch. Over-torque will cause the plates to slip. A simple example is found in a fixed-spool fishing reel, where the slipping torque is set by means of a large <b>hand</b> <b>nut</b> in order that the reel will turn and allow more line to unwind before the line breaks under the pull of a fish.|$|E
50|$|A {{knurled nut}} is a nut with a knurled outside surface. This {{facilitates}} tightening by <b>hand</b> (thumb <b>nut)</b> or secures the nut in a substrate (insertion nut).|$|R
50|$|It is {{important}} to note that the actual <b>nut</b> <b>hand</b> may not be the same as the absolute nut hand; for example, if the board is 7♥ 2♣ K♠ K♥ 3♦ a player with K♣ K♦ has the absolute <b>nut</b> <b>hand.</b> However, any player with K-7 knows that he has the <b>nut</b> <b>hand</b> as it is impossible for another player to have two kings. The phrase may also refer to a hand in progress with cards yet to be dealt, as the player can be said to have the nuts at that time. For example if a player holds 7♠ 8♠ on a board of 5♣ 6♠ 9♥ he can be said to have the nuts, however if the next card comes 7♥ then 8-10 becomes the nuts. This makes some <b>nut</b> <b>hands</b> very vulnerable in nine-card games, such as Omaha hold 'em.|$|R

50|$|In poker, the <b>nut</b> <b>hand</b> is {{the strongest}} {{possible}} hand in a given situation. The second-nut hand or third-nut hand (and so on) may refer to {{the second and third}} best possible hands. The term applies mostly to community card poker games where the individual holding the strongest possible hand, with the given board of community cards, is capable of knowing that they have the <b>nut</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|R

50|$|In Texas hold 'em, if {{the board}} is 5♠ 6♠ A♣ 9♠ 5♥, a player holding 7♠ 8♠ has the <b>nut</b> <b>hand,</b> a 9-high {{straight}} flush of spades, and cannot lose. On the same board, the hand 5♣ 5♦ would be the second-nut hand, four of a kind fives; the third-nut hand would be any pair of the remaining three aces, making a full house, aces full of fives.|$|R

50|$|Under the {{circumstances}} of this example: Worm will bet his <b>nut</b> <b>hand</b> two times, for every one time he bluffs against Mike's hand (assuming Mike's hand would lose to the nuts and beat a bluff). This means that (if he called all three bets) Mike would win one time, and lose two times, and would break even against 2-to-1 pot odds. This also means that Worm's odds against bluffing is also 2-to-1 (since he will value bet twice, and bluff once).|$|R

50|$|The 15-40-hp is {{fitted with}} Humber-Perrott semi-servo front wheel brakes. The driver's foot pedal still works the {{transmission}} brake {{and now the}} front wheel brakes as well. A floating shoe gives the semi-servo effect and it relies to some extent on forward motion. Applying the brakes when backing the car receives only half the force. Front axle and stub axles are strengthened to accommodate the higher loads from braking, to the same end the springs are wider {{and there is a}} new cross tube linking the dumb irons (forward ends of the main longitudinal chassis members). Front brake adjustment is carried out by jacking up that end of the car and the <b>hand</b> operated <b>nuts</b> turned until equal pressure is provided to each wheel. The following year a compensating device is installed between the two sets of brakes.|$|R

Thorntons, the {{confectionery}} company once based in the town of Belper became major sponsors. At the ceremony, members of the <b>NUT</b> <b>handed</b> out leaflets condemning the public-private involvement.

5000|$|Pot-limit Omaha (shortened to PLO) {{is popular}} in Europe, online, and in high-stakes [...] "mixed games" [...] played in some American casinos.

Furthermore, because of the exponential growth of the pot size in pot-limit play, seeing one of these hands to the end can be very expensive and carry immense reverse implied odds.|$|R
5000|$|Their name {{refers to}} the wooden nuts worn at their knees, waists and wrists, which are made from the tops of bobbins. They are {{protective}} work gear for the hands and knees, essential in mining work involving crawling. The waist nut is a spare in case of breakage or loss of the others. These are tapped together like castanets as a percussive accompaniment to the dance, the <b>nuts</b> on the <b>hands</b> striking the <b>nuts</b> on the waist or knees in an intricate and dextrous rhythm. [...] They wear white turbans with blue plumes, dark jerseys and trews, a white baldric, red and white skirts, white hose and black clogs.|$|R
50|$|The {{luxuriant}} {{growth of}} palms {{is the most}} characteristic feature of the vegetation. Betel nut palm or supari (Areca catechu) plantations {{are more and more}} abundant towards the north and the west of the district and grows almost in forest. Coconut are grown abundantly throughout the district. Toddy palms or tal (Borassus flabellifer) and date palms or khejur are also very common. Date palm is a valuable tree. The juice is extracted and made into gurr, the leaves are made into mat. Tal wood is used for posts of houses and other building purposes, leaves are used for making handmade mats and large <b>hand</b> fans. Betel <b>nut</b> and coconut are good source of household income.|$|R
50|$|Although controversial, it {{has been}} claimed (since at least by Robert Burton in 1621) that she brought the {{distinctive}} protruding lower lip (prognathism) into the family, a particular physical characteristic of {{most members of the}} family for many generations until the 18th century. It can even be recognized in some of her distant descendants (though not as markedly) as King Alphonse XIII of Spain (1886-1941). However, already her husband's great-grandfather King Albert I or his uncle Duke Rudolf IV were presented in portraits with it, while Cymburgis' statue in the Innsbruck Hofkirche church does not show this feature. Tradition has it that she was also known for her exceptional strength, which, for example, she showed by driving nails into the wall with her bare <b>hands</b> and cracking <b>nuts</b> between her fingers. Strength also distinguished one of her descendants, Augustus II the Strong, who used to break horseshoes with his bare hands. Cymburgis outlived her husband and died on a pilgrimage to Mariazell while staying at Türnitz (in present-day Lower Austria). She is buried at Lilienfeld Abbey.|$|R
60|$|But Joe said it didn't {{matter and}} made her sit down by the fire. He was very nice with her. He told her all {{that went on in}} his office, repeating for her a smart answer which he had made to the manager. Maria did not {{understand}} why Joe laughed so much over the answer he had made but she said that the manager must have been a very overbearing person to deal with. Joe said he wasn't so bad when you knew how to take him, that he was a decent sort so long as you didn't rub him the wrong way. Mrs. Donnelly played the piano for the children and they danced and sang. Then the two next-door girls <b>handed</b> round the <b>nuts.</b> Nobody could find the nutcrackers and Joe was nearly getting cross over it and asked how did they expect Maria to crack nuts without a nutcracker. But Maria said she didn't like nuts and that they weren't to bother about her. Then Joe asked would she take a bottle of stout and Mrs. Donnelly said there was port wine too in the house if she would prefer that. Maria said she would rather they didn't ask her to take anything: but Joe insisted.|$|R
60|$|Turning now to {{the nearest}} allies of man, and {{therefore}} to the best representatives of our early progenitors, {{we find that the}} hands in the Quadrumana are constructed on the same general pattern as in us, but are far less perfectly adapted for diversified uses. Their hands do not serve so well as the feet of a dog for locomotion; as may be seen in those monkeys which walk on the outer margins of the palms, or on the backs of their bent fingers, as in the chimpanzee and orang.[200] Their hands, however, are admirably adapted for climbing trees. Monkeys seize thin branches or ropes, with the thumb {{on one side and the}} fingers and palm on the other side, in the same manner as we do. They can thus also carry rather large objects, such as the neck of a bottle, to their mouths. Baboons turn over stones and scratch up roots with their <b>hands.</b> They seize <b>nuts,</b> insects, or other small objects with the thumb in opposition to the fingers, and no doubt they thus extract eggs and the young from the nests of birds. American monkeys beat the wild oranges on the branches until the rind is cracked, and then tear it off with the fingers of the two hands. Other monkeys open mussel-shells with the two thumbs. With their fingers they pull out thorns and burrs, and hunt for each other’s parasites. In a state of nature they break open hard fruits with the aid of stones. They roll down stones or throw them at their enemies; nevertheless, they perform these various actions clumsily, and they are quite unable, as I have myself seen, to throw a stone with precision.|$|R
40|$|The {{institutions}} which support {{fair trade}} offer solutions capable of combining {{the benefits of}} international trade with socially, economically and environmentally sustainable enterprise. The case {{of the creation of}} the supply chain for the harvesting and sale of Brazil nuts and its evolution over time is an excellent example of a slow – yet dramatic – social and economic process which began about thirty years ago. Using Social-Economical System approach to the interpretation of social policies capable of using, managing and conserving the commons resources, the paper reveals that full compliance with the principles of cooperation throughout an entire supply chain has succeeded in providing benefits both in economic terms and with regard to the protection of the Amazon rain forest, a strategic natural resource. The supply chain evolved in three crucial phases. The first phase saw the emergence of a modern form of cooperative company – similar to the cooperative firms for the marketing of agricultural produce typical of Italy’s Emilia Region – which formed a network of local communities and individual gatherers. In the second phase, a second cooperative was formed, reinforcing the harvesting, transport and wholesale distribution chain, and finally, the entire supply chain found a market outlet through the action of the retail chains, which on the one <b>hand</b> added the <b>nuts</b> to their product range on a permanent basis, and on the other provided the final consumer with the necessary information about the exact nature of the process and product. Once the chain achieved a good level of operational stability, the reduction in risk for the various segments of the supply chain – especially the final segment, distribution – generated additional benefits for all the stakeholders (reduction in retail prices and an increase in the share of revenues reaching producers).

40|$|In {{this work}} were studied diverse {{physiological}} mechanisms, as the osmotic adjustment, photosynthesis, including gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, {{as well the}} oxidative responses in physic nuts submitted to different abiotic stresses as: salinity, drought and high temperature. The first experiment aimed to {{study the effects of}} increase of the NaCl concentrations (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 mM) in the ions accumulate (Na+, Cl- and K+) and some growth variables, as well evaluate the water state and the principals solutes (organic and inorganic) involved on the osmotic adjustment of physic nuts plants under this stressful condition. Physic nuts plants showed sensibility to salt stress, presenting a reduction by 50 % in dry matter from by 47 mM of NaCl concentration during 15 -d. This sensibility should be due the leaf Na+ and Cl- high accumulation, associated a strong reduction in the K+ concentration, induced by high Na+ content. On the other <b>hand,</b> physic <b>nuts</b> plants were able osmotic adjust to salinity due a severe decrease on the osmotic potential and increase of leaf water state, principally in the higher NaCl levels. Of the solutes studied, was observed that salt ions (Na+ and Cl-) contributed with the most of the osmotic adjustment, while that the K+ contribution was decreased strongly by NaCl. The glycinebetaine compared to proline was more important to the osmotic adjustment of physic nuts leaves, as in the absence as in presence of different NaCl levels in the nutrient solution. The second experiment evaluated the resistance of photosynthetic apparatus of physic nuts plants submitted to different time of exposure (7 -d and 14 -d of treatment and 3 -d of recovery) to salt stress (100 mM of NaCl). The changes caused on photochemistry activity and leaf gas exchange were evaluate by Na+ and Cl- accumulation and decrease of K+/Na+ ratio in the leaves. After 7 -d of treatment was observed a major action of osmotic effects. However, after 14 -d of treatment, the ionic effects caused by Na+ and Cl- excessive accumulation and by K+/Na+ ratio strong reduction in the leaves, caused permanent damages on the photosynthesis of physic nuts plants due as the stomatal limitations as non-stomatal ones. The third experiment aimed to study the comparative effects between the salt stress (50 mM of NaCl) and water stress (induced for PEG 6000), both with osmotic potential of â 0. 22 MPa on the photosynthesis, water relations and growth of physic nuts plants. The water stress effects induced for PEG in the leaf growth, electrolyte leakage and leaf gas exchange were more deleterious than by NaCl ones. In the both stresses was observed decrease in the leaf CO 2 assimilation due the stomatal and non-stomatal limitations. However, the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters did not affect. The fourth experiment aimed to evaluate the relative contribution of organic and inorganic solutes on the osmotic adjustment of leaves and roots physic nuts plants in different water restriction levels. Of the solutes studied, the K+ and soluble sugar were the most involved in the osmotic adjustment as in the leaves as in roots. Others solutes as, Na+, Cl-, total amino acids and glycibetaine, also presented a effective role in the reduction of osmotic potential in both organs. On the other hand, the leaf proline content, although has increased significantly, was not sufficient to promote an effective participation of this amino acid in the osmotic adjustment of physic nuts plants. The same experiment aimed to observe the isolated and combined effects of water stress and high temperature on the photosynthesis and evaluate the oxidative defenses system in physic nuts plants. The photosynthetic apparatus was more sensitive to water stress than heat ones, been that the combination of them caused deleterious effects yet large in this complex. Additionally, the oxidative damages also were more marked in the combined stress. In general, the data shown that physic nuts plants, although present ability to adjust osmotically to salinity and drought, have their photosynthetic apparatus very affected in this stressful conditions.
