By the way, scat is {{something}} {{that a lot of}} people don't understand, and they begin to believe that the first scat numbers was ever done, was done by one of my hometown boys, Louie Armstrong. But I must take the credit away, since I know better. The first man that ever did a scat number in history of this country was a man from Vicksburg, Mississippi, by the name of Joe Sims, an old comedian. And from that, Tony Jackson and myself, and several more grabbed it in New Orleans. And found <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> good for an introduction of a song.|$|E

He added, [...] "there were some really loving, caring moments between four people: a hotel room here and there – a really amazing closeness.

500|$|Terron R. Moore of Ology {{gave the}} episode a {{slightly}} more positive review, writing, [...] ""The Story Of Brenda Q", judging by only the title, {{could have been a}} Lifetime movie in the Seth MacFarlane fashion or anything else than a typical episode of the show, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> much a typical episode of the show." [...] He continued, [...] "it's pretty much an episode where someone on the Family Guy writing staff needed a new way to get out a bunch of pent-up misogyny and anger."

500|$|Actor Joshua Jackson {{believed}} the episode was important developmentally for the series, explaining it was [...] "creatively {{when the show}} really hit its stride in the first season." [...] Jackson continued, [...] "I think right around the midway point of [...] season the show decided what it wanted to be. From about the midway, point it got on a pretty good streak of episodes. I can’t remember the exact number, but the two-part episode where Dunham gets kidnapped.

500|$|The {{music on}} Slay Tracks was written entirely by Malkmus, and he stated his {{influences}} on the record included Chrome, Swell Maps, and The Fall. The songs on the EP drew comparisons {{to the likes of}} R.E.M., Pixies, and Sonic Youth by Stephen Thomas Erlewine and Heather Phares of AllMusic. Radio static and noise are prominently used on the EP, techniques which are characteristic of the lo-fi and noise pop genres that Pavement are frequently associated with. According to Malkmus, [...] "We decided to use static as the third instrument. .... <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> exciting to be so experimental." [...] Young played drums on [...] "Box Elder" [...] and [...] "Price Yeah!", and frequently improvised.

Kerslake prepared five treatments during July and August 1993, but no shoot arrangements were made {{and by the end}} of the month, the group decided to work with Dutch photographer and video director Anton Corbijn. Corbijn, who typically created his own ideas for videos, was initially unsure of directing the video since Cobain's treatment was so detailed. Corbijn said, [...] "But then I looked at it and I thought that actually <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> good.

[...] They were engaged at Chasen's restaurant in Los Angeles and were married on March 4, 1952, at the Little Brown Church in the Valley (North Hollywood, now Studio City) San Fernando Valley.

And the reason we pulled back – {{you know when you}} stop when you have two #1 records, it’s not really the greatest career move – but we did that because we love each other and we didn’t want to die in public. And I know for a fact in my heart that if we were to continue that I wouldn’t be on the phone right now talking to you. I wouldn’t have made it. I just wouldn’t have." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the months}} pre-dating Batmans release in June 1989, a popular culture {{phenomenon}} rose known as [...] "Batmania". Over $750 {{million worth of}} merchandise was sold. Cult filmmaker and comic book writer Kevin Smith remembered: [...] "That summer was huge. You couldn't turn around without seeing the Bat-Signal somewhere. People were cutting it into their fucking heads. It was just the summer of Batman {{and if you were}} a comic book fan <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> hot." [...] Hachette Book Group USA published a novelization, Batman written by Craig Shaw Gardner. It remained on the New York Times Best Seller list throughout June 1989. Burton admitted he was annoyed by the publicity. David Handelman of The New York Observer categorized Batman as a high concept film. He believed [...] "it is less movie than a corporate behemoth".|$|E

"She (May Stebbins) {{wrote down}} the numbers as the {{observer}} called them, but after some nights of recording a hundred readings just to get one magnitude, she said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> slow business.

[...] It happened that within two or three months, the Department of Physics gave an open house, and one of the exhibits was in (the) charge of a young instructor, F.C. Brown. He showed how, when he turned on a lamp to illuminate a selenium cell, a bell would ring, when the lamp was off, the bell would stop.

500|$|After {{completing}} the lead vocals, Swivel decided {{to rework the}} 1980s sound on the snares as they were originally very tight. He therefore added a gated reverb for the snap sound which was long and drawn‑out snap sound. He also subbed in an additional kick underneath to add some real oomph to the bottom. Owing to the work Swivel had accomplished during production, the final mix took only a few hours. He said: [...] "There {{were a lot of}} tracks, but I just enjoyed it, to be honest. I knew how I wanted it to sound, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>pretty</b> much the last song we cut; a lot of the mixing was nailed in the production as well, which helped. Dream did a great job producing this track." [...] The bar one guitar track of [...] "Schoolin' Life" [...] was entirely programmed. Similarly, the live drum section in the hook was actually done with programmed drums. Once the mixing was over, Swivel's impression were as follows: ...|$|E
