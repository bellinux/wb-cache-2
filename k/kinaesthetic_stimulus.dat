40|$|Normally, when {{we explore}} or {{manipulate}} objects {{more than one}} of our fingers will come into contact with and move over a surface. Movement of the object or our fingers may give rise to different motion at each finger yet we retain a sense of a single object. We have investigated this by examining how correlated motion across the fingers may help detection of a <b>kinaesthetic</b> <b>stimulus.</b> We have found lowered thresholds for detecting stimuli in the presence of positively correlated background movement compared to negatively or uncorrelated background movement. In future experiments we will investigate the effect of positive correlation by varying time differences between the movements at the fingers. 1...|$|E
40|$|Scholarship on {{instructive}} {{technologies in}} higher education has emphasized the use of high-tech facilitative technologies for long-term use, and low-tech props to illustrate single topics. This paper, on the contrary, discusses {{the use of a}} long-term, low-tech instructional technology: Llewelyn the Lynx was a soft animal used to assist with discussions in first year seminars. In-class questionnaires and anonymous online reviews on RateYour-Lecturer show Llewelyn was popular, facilitated equal contribution to discussion, and made seminars less intimidating and more enjoyable. Llewelyn may have functioned as a tactual or <b>kinaesthetic</b> <b>stimulus,</b> and an assistive technology for students with learning difficulties. His use {{does not seem to have}} infantilized most of the students although there was some disagreement here...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} ability of {{patients}} with cerebellar degeneration to perceive differences in <b>kinaesthetic</b> <b>stimuli</b> and compared it with that of normal subjects. All participants were tested for duration, amplitude and velocity sensation. In separate experiments, the responses of muscle spindle afferents and slowly adapting cutaneous mechanoreceptors to the <b>kinaesthetic</b> <b>stimuli</b> were recorded. The performance of patients with cerebellar degeneration was significantly worse than that of normal subjects on the tasks testing for duration and velocity perception. Although both spindle afferents and slowly adapting cutaneous mechanoreceptors were able to provide relevant sensory information during the kinaesthetic tasks, spindle afferents were superior in detecting velocity changes. These {{results suggest that the}} cerebellum may be involved in processing sensory signals that are involved in motor control as well as in conscious perception. Key words: kinaesthesia; cerebellum; muscle spindle; cutaneous mechanoreceptor; feedforwar...|$|R
40|$|The {{preliminary}} study {{described in this}} paper is about {{the assessment of the}} control parameters of a non-grounded haptic device giving <b>kinaesthetic</b> <b>stimuli</b> to indicate to the user a direction to follow to reach a target location. The haptic sensation is created by tilting one or more rotating flywheels along an axis, controlling the direction and the amount of tilt, the velocity of the tilt (during the pulse and the repositioning of the flywheel), the frequency of pulses. The current prototype has only one flywheel and is able to tilt along a single axis, thus indicating only “right” or “left” direction. The experiments performed with the prototype allowed us to define a set of requirements (torque produced, duration of the stimuli) for a more complex prototype (2 flywheels and 2 DOF) to be developed and tested as future work...|$|R
40|$|International audienceListening to an {{auditory}} scene {{enables us}} to recognize a lot of events without even having to see them. For instance, a friend can often be recognized simply from the sounds {{of his or her}} footsteps. Understanding the links between the acoustical properties of sounds and the properties of the action imagined from them is a challenge that may help to understand how our sensorimotor interaction with the surrounding world constrains our perception. In this article we’ll present results of recent works on the acoustic characterization of a particular category of biological movements, namely drawing movements. In fact, if we listen carefully to the friction sounds produced by someone drawing, a movement can be perceived through the dynamic behaviour of the sounds. How do we interpret this movement imagined from a friction sound? Is it for instance possible to recognize {{whether or not it is}} a human movement and can the drawn shapes be deduced from the dynamics of such sounds? These questions might not seem important at first sight. However, as opposed to visual or <b>kinaesthetic</b> <b>stimuli,</b> monophonic sounds have the remarkable ability to transmit dynamic information independently from any geometric or spatial cues. Hence, investigating the movements imagined by someone who is listening to such sounds gives a unique opportunity to relate the properties of percepts to possible sensorimotor constraints. Highlighting a relation between drawing movements and auditory perception might thus provide a new experimental framework to study how the sensorimotor contingencies (SMC) (O’Regan & Noë, 2001) shape our sensory processes and behaviours...|$|R
40|$|Aims of the Project The aim of {{the project}} has been to: (a) {{investigate}} the influence that systems of spatial representation exert upon the communication of aesthetic qualities arising specifically from direct experience of our physical environment; (b) to study the qualitative differences in perception of landscape space experienced through systems of visual representation used in contemporary visual art; and (c) to investigate the capacity of digitally augmented stereoscopy to visualise new models of landscape suitable to an art gallery setting. This research project examines the representation of space in stereoscopic imaging. It places the visual thesis {{in the context of}} the history and theory of the stereoscopic representation of space and the impact of changing notions of space on our perception of the landscape. Images of Mt Lyell form the central subject matter of the visual thesis and provide the foundation for observations regarding the success of the anaglyphic and mirror stereoscopic methodologies employed. The project concludes that the veracity of stereoscopy as a medium of simulation still challenges current Virtual Reality technologies in terms of the degree and quality of immersion achieved and congruity of visual and <b>kinaesthetic</b> <b>stimuli.</b> It also demonstrates that the stereoscopic image conveys aesthetic information about the quality of the space it presents. It concludes that the application of d igital processes to stereoscopic photography can result in new aesthetic modes for presenting and representing landscape as a comprehensive experience and that such presentations can be used to enquire into the manner in which the aura of a landscape space is established and maintained...|$|R
5000|$|The {{sense of}} touch, or tactile perception, is what allows organisms {{to feel the}} world around them. The {{environment}} acts as an external stimulus, and tactile perception is the act of passively exploring the world to simply sense it. To {{make sense of the}} stimuli, an organism will undergo active exploration, or haptic perception, by moving their hands or other areas with environment-skin contact. [...] This will give a sense of what is being perceived, and give information about size, shape, weight, temperature, and material. Tactile stimulation can be direct in the form of bodily contact, or indirect {{through the use of a}} tool or probe. Direct and indirect send different types messages to the brain, but both provide information regarding roughness, hardness, stickiness, and warmth. The use of a probe elicits a response based on the vibrations in the instrument rather than direct environmental information. [...] Tactual perception gives information regarding cutaneous stimuli (pressure, vibration, and temperature), <b>kinaesthetic</b> <b>stimuli</b> (limb movement), and proprioceptive stimuli (position of the body). [...] There are varying degrees of tactual sensitivity and thresholds, both between individuals and between different time periods in an individual's life. [...] It has been observed that individuals have differing levels of tactile sensitivity between each hand. This may be due to callouses forming on the skin of the most used hand, creating a buffer between the stimulus and the receptor. Alternately, the difference in sensitivity may be due to a difference in the cerebral functions or ability of the left and right hemisphere. [...] Tests have also shown that deaf children have a greater degree of tactile sensitivity than that of children with normal hearing ability, and that girls generally have a greater degree of sensitivity than that of boys.|$|R
