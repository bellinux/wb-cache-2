Lt. Breeze and for Spangler. At other times he is drinking Old Forester, a Kentucky bourbon: [...] "I hung up and fed myself a slug of Old Forester to brace my nerves for the interview. As I was inhaling it <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> steps tripping along the corridor."

2500|$|In {{addition}} to her musical skills, Callas had a particular gift for language {{and the use of}} language in music. In recitatives, she always knew which word to emphasize and which syllable in that word to bring out. Michael Scott notes, [...] "If we listen attentively, we note how her perfect legato enables her to suggest by musical means even the exclamation marks and commas of the text." [...] Technically, not only did she have the capacity to perform the most difficult florid music effortlessly, but also she had the ability to use each ornament as an expressive device rather than for mere fireworks. Soprano Martina Arroyo states, [...] "What interested me most was how she gave the runs and the cadenzas words. That always floored me. I always felt <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> saying something—it was never just singing notes. That alone is an art." [...] Walter Legge states that, ...|$|E
2500|$|Many famous {{international}} musicians have complimented her vocal prowess. Grammy-award winner Michel Legrand has praised Velasquez, saying, [...] "The {{first time}} <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> sing, I said to myself, 'what the hell? I {{owe it to}} the rest of the world to introduce this voice to them'. She is the voice with both the range and the heart - which is like none I've ever heard of in my entire career." [...] After singing A Piece of Sky with Velasquez, Legrand exclaimed, [...] "It's tough to sing that song after Barbra Streisand, I will tell you, but to sing with Regine is.. I'm in heaven. She sings so well, she has such an extraordinary technical and sensitive voice and talented expression." [...] When asked who was Brian McKnight's favorite Filipino singer, the 16-time Grammy nominated artist immediately answered Regine Velasquez, [...] "Regine is probably one of the greatest singers I have ever heard anywhere. She can hold her own next to anyone. I doubt that anybody would want to come behind her after she sings." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{recovery}} from her throat nodules, Cosima De Vito {{was unable to}} negotiate a suitable record deal and funded her own label, (CDV Records) with the financial help of her family. Her managers, Constantine Nellis and Ted Gardner, [...] "took on the singer after she was widely shunned by local record companies". For her independent album, Cosima, she flew to Los Angeles to have ten of its eleven tracks penned by Diane Warren (Celine Dion, Christina Aguilera, and Aerosmith) who commented [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> sing I was blown away ... Cosima is a younger, edgier Celine Dion". On 9 August 2004 Cosima's first single, the double A-sided, [...] "When the War Is Over" [...] / [...] "One Night Without You", was released. [...] "When the War Is Over" [...] is a cover of a Cold Chisel ballad and [...] "One Night Without Your" [...] was one of Warren's tracks. It debuted at No. 1 in the ARIA Singles Chart ahead of fellow Australian Idol Paulini's [...] "Angel Eyes" [...] and Australian singer-songwriter, Missy Higgins' [...] "Scar" [...] (both had reached No. 1 earlier). The single was certified platinum by ARIA for shipment of 70,000 units by December 2004. An alternate version of the song, with production similar to her live idol performance, was recorded before working with Diane Warren. This version was not released as the overall sound {{was different from the}} rest of the album and so a new version (which was later released as the single) was recorded. On 11 October 2004 her self-titled debut album, Cosima, was released. It debut at No. 2 on the ARIA Albums Chart and No. 1 on the Independent charts. While it was certified gold, for shipment of 35,000 units by ARIA, it quickly left the Top 50 after spending only a few weeks in the charts.|$|E

6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> answer, {{and then}} {{the sound of a}} scuffle that maddened me. Knife in hand, I crept slowly about, and put my fingers on a man's neck and side.

60|$|And as I rode off <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> giving {{directions}} in no mild tone to the coachman through Mr. Allen.|$|E

6000|$|... "Sometimes; and <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> of <b>her</b> {{from the}} Actons, {{who had an}} immense regard for her husband, who, they say, was a very {{superior}} man." ...|$|R
60|$|For {{the first}} time <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> voice, very slow and soft, almost languid, yet very {{pleasant}} to listen to.|$|E
60|$|Then {{she turned}} and passed away into {{the shadow of the}} trees; <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> graveclothes sweep upon the grass.|$|E

6000|$|... "And who WAS your dear mamma?" [...] said I: for Miss Crutty's {{respected}} parent {{had been}} long since dead, and <b>I</b> never <b>heard</b> <b>her</b> name mentioned in the family.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>her,</b> but I {{could say}} nothing. Her last words {{had killed the}} little hope that still lived in me.|$|E
