40|$|In {{order to}} connect the {{appearance}} of macrophages and giant cells in pulmonary tissue with the time of asphyxia the authors analyzed 50 asphyxiated <b>human</b> <b>lungs</b> paying their attention {{on the number of}} alveolar and interstitial macrophages and giant cells. They compared histological specimens of 25 asphixiated <b>humans</b> <b>lungs</b> following a slow asphyxia (30 min or more) with 25 histological specimens of asphyxiated <b>human</b> <b>lungs</b> following a rapid asphyxia (10 - 15 min). Alveolar and interstitial macrophages and giant cells per section, were considered and numbered. Controls were done on histological examination of traumatized lungs. In the pulmonary alveoli following on acute asphyxia there were 27. 7 +/- 4. 4 macrophages per section. Subjects dead after a slow asphyxiation showed 68. 2 +/- 7. 1 alveolar macrophages per section (p< 0. 001). Interstitial macrophages were also frequently present. No differences are detectable in the number of polynuclear giant cells between rapidly and slowly asphyxiated <b>human</b> <b>lungs.</b> The number of alveolar and interstitial macrophages per section can be considered as a further histological evidence of a slow asphyxia and can differentiate a slow asphyxia from an acute on...|$|R
25|$|The {{history of}} organ transplants began with several {{attempts}} that were unsuccessful due to transplant rejection.

25|$|Pneumocystis jirovecii was {{originally}} {{described as a}} rare cause of pneumonia in neonates.

The possibility of person-to-person transmission has recently gained credence, with supporting evidence coming from many different genotyping studies of Pneumocystis jirovecii isolates from <b>human</b> <b>lung</b> tissue. For example, in one outbreak of 12 cases among transplant patients in Leiden, it was suggested as likely, but not proven, that human-to-human spread may have occurred.|$|E
25|$|A {{large-scale}} attack using anthrax {{would require}} the creation of aerosol particles of 1.5 to 5µm: larger particles would not reach the lower respiratory tract, while smaller particles would be exhaled {{back out into the}} atmosphere. At this size, conductive powders tend to aggregate because of electrostatic charges, hindering dispersion. So the material must be treated to insulate and neutralize the charges. The weaponized agent must be resistant to degradation by rain and ultraviolet radiation from sunlight, while retaining the ability to efficiently infect the <b>human</b> <b>lung.</b> There are other technological difficulties as well, chiefly relating to storage of the weaponized agent.|$|E

25|$|A {{review of}} {{evidence}} regarding whether ambient air pollution exposure {{is a risk}} factor for cancer in 2007 found solid data to conclude that long-term exposure to PM2.5 (fine particulates) increases the overall risk of non-accidental mortality by 6% per a 10 microg/m3 increase. Exposure to PM2.5 was also associated with an increased risk of mortality from lung cancer (range: 15% to 21% per 10 microg/m3 increase) and total cardiovascular mortality (range: 12% to 14% per a 10 microg/m3 increase). The review further noted that living close to busy traffic appears to be associated with elevated risks of these three outcomes --- increase in lung cancer deaths, cardiovascular deaths, and overall non-accidental deaths. The reviewers also found suggestive evidence that exposure to PM2.5 is positively associated with mortality from coronary heart diseases and exposure to SO2 increases mortality from lung cancer, but the data was insufficient to provide solid conclusions. Another investigation showed that higher activity level increases deposition fraction of aerosol particles in <b>human</b> <b>lung</b> and recommended avoiding heavy activities like running in outdoor space at polluted areas.|$|E
25|$|Before {{techniques}} of molecular biology {{were used to}} localize indolethylamine N-methyltransferase (INMT), characterization and localization went on a par: samples of the biological material where INMT is hypothesized to be active are subject to enzyme assay. Those enzyme assays are performed either with a radiolabeled methyl donor like (14C-CH3)SAM to which known amounts of unlabeled substrates like tryptamine are added or with addition of a radiolabeled substrate like (14C)NMT to demonstrate in vivo formation. As qualitative determination of the radioactively tagged product of the enzymatic reaction is sufficient to characterize INMT existence and activity (or lack of), analytical methods used in INMT assays {{are not required to}} be as sensitive as those needed to directly detect and quantify the minute amounts of endogenously formed DMT (see DMT subsection below). The essentially qualitative method thin layer chromatography (TLC) was thus used in a vast majority of studies. Also, robust evidence that INMT can catalyze transmethylation of tryptamine into NMT and DMT could be provided with reverse isotope dilution analysis coupled to mass spectrometry for rabbit and <b>human</b> <b>lung</b> during the early 1970s.|$|E

25|$|An {{immediate}} {{obstacle to}} human activity under {{water is the}} fact that <b>human</b> <b>lungs</b> cannot naturally function in this environment. Unlike the gills of fish, <b>human</b> <b>lungs</b> are adapted to the exchange of gases at atmospheric pressure, not liquids. Aside from simply having insufficient musculature to rapidly move water {{in and out of the}} lungs, a more significant problem for all air-breathing animals, such as mammals and birds, is that water contains so little dissolved oxygen compared with atmospheric air. Air is around 21% O2; water typically is less than 0.001% dissolved oxygen.|$|R
40|$|Measurement of {{velocity}} in <b>human</b> <b>lungs</b> during breathing {{cycle is}} a challenging task for researchers, since the measuring location is accessible only with significant difficulties. A special measuring rig consisting of optically transparent replica of <b>human</b> <b>lungs,</b> breathing simulator, particle generator and Laser-Doppler anemometer {{was developed and}} used for investigation of the velocity in specific locations of lungs during simulated breathing cycle. Experiments were performed on two different replicas of <b>human</b> <b>lungs</b> in corresponding measuring points to facilitate {{the analysis of the}} influence of the geometry and its simplification on the flow. The analysis of velocity course and turbulence intensity revealed that special attention should be devoted to the modelling of vocal cords position during breathing, as the position of laryngeal jet created by vocal cords significantly influences velocity profiles in trachea. The shapes of velocity courses during expiration proved to be consistent for both replicas; however magnitudes of peak expiratory velocity differ between the corresponding measuring points in both the replicas...|$|R

One study found that after 24-hour exposure to 40 µM dauricine, there was more than 60% cell death in the aforementioned <b>human</b> <b>lung</b> cell lines. Moreover, CYP3A, a class of human recombinant P450 enzymes, have been found to activate dauricine in <b>human</b> <b>lung</b> cells, resulting in the formation of quinone methide metabolite whose role in lung cytotoxicity needs to be further studied.

40|$|ABSTRACT: It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by some studies of <b>human</b> and animal <b>lungs</b> that the products of pulmonary endocrine cells, particularly gastrin-releasing pep-tide, might {{play a role in}} fibrogenesis, but more recent detailed studies of fibro-tic <b>human</b> <b>lungs</b> have failed to confirm this. We have made a detailed quantitative examination of a series of fibrotic <b>human</b> <b>lungs</b> {{to see if we could}} determine whether there was any relationship between endocrine cells and fibrosis. Using immunocytochemistry, we investigated the morphology, content, distrib-ution and number of pulmonary endocrine cells in 15 pairs of fibrotic lungs from coal miners, and compared their features with those of equivalent cells in age-matched controls. Proliferation of endocrine cells was seen in the lungs of just two miners, in which it was focal and associated with acute bronchitis and bronchopneumonia. There was no difference between the miners and controls in the appearance (mostly soli-tary cells), content (predominantly gastrin-releasing peptide and calcitonin), dis-tribution (mainly in small bronchi and bronchioles), or number (4. 5 vs 4. 1 cells per 10, 000 epithelial cells, respectively) of endocrine cells. It seems unlikely that the substances secreted by these cells play any role in stimulating fibrosis in <b>human</b> <b>lungs,</b> but rather that they have a function in the inflammatory response to pulmonary injury...|$|R

40|$|Growing {{concern about}} {{knowledge}} of aerosol transport in <b>human</b> <b>lungs</b> {{is caused by}} great potential of use of inhaled pharmaceuticals. Second substantial motive for the research {{is an effort to}} minimize adverse effects of particular matter emitted by traffic and industry on human health. We created model geometry of <b>human</b> <b>lungs</b> to 7 th generation of branching. This model geometry was used for fabrication of two physical models. The first one is made from thin walled transparent silicone and it allows a measurement of velocity and size of aerosol particles by Phase Doppler Anemometry (PDA). The second one is fabricated by stereolithographic method and it is designed for aerosol deposition measurements. We provided a series of measurements of aerosol transport in the transparent model and we ascertained remarkable phenomena linked with lung flow. The results are presented in brief. To gather how this phenomena affects aerosol deposition in <b>human</b> <b>lungs</b> we used the second model and we developed a technique for deposition fraction and deposition efficiency assessment. The results confirmed that non-symmetric and complicated shape of human airways essentially affects transport and deposition of aerosol.
