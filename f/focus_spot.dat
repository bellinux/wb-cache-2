To ex-pand the film application, formation of oxygen {{deficiencies in the}} film {{was one of the}} useful meth-ods. Electrical resistance of the film can be decreased due to oxygen deficiencies formation. The lo-cal heating process in vacuum is a useful method to create the oxygen deficiencies in local area of the film. Electrical resistance might be locally decreased by local heating with a CW fiber laser. In our experiment, the films were irradiated with the laser in vacuum. Control of temperature on the film was very important for reducing the electrical resistance. Therefore, temperature monitoring of the laser <b>focusing</b> <b>spot</b> area on the film was performed. Temperature of the laser <b>focusing</b> <b>spot</b> area was increased as the laser intensity was increased. Then, the electrical resistance of the laser focus-ing spot area was decreased as the laser intensity was increased. Thus, electrical resistance of the la-ser <b>focusing</b> <b>spot</b> area was decreased as temperature of the laser <b>focusing</b> <b>spot</b> area was increased. These results indicated that electrical resistance of the laser <b>focusing</b> <b>spot</b> area was controlled by changing temperature on the laser <b>focusing</b> <b>spot</b> area...|$|R

Signal from random displacements of the <b>focus</b> <b>spot</b> around the optical axis within the constricted area is collected.

The pinhole produces Fresnel diffraction on the <b>focus</b> <b>spot.</b> The cone reflector provides directed reflectance onto the pinhole for random <b>focus</b> <b>spot</b> displacements due to beam wander.

The method is applied to free-space optical communications at a wavelength of 1. 55 [*]μm with an atmospheric chamber to provide optical propagation media. Based on calculations, the beam wander angles that can be received by the OSF are from 14. 0 ° to 28. 0 °.
