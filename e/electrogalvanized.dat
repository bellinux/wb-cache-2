40|$|The {{physical}} metallurgy and related process and product performance concepts for the zinc and zinc alloy {{hot dip coating}} of steel wire are briefly reviewed, and are illustrated with a detailed model of aluminum behavior in Galfan ® process technology. Applications to hot dip bath management practices are set forth. Background The coating of iron and steel with zinc to improve corrosion resistance has been practiced in various forms for 260 years, and a thorough description of the numerous wire-related technologies has been compiled in the handbook Ferrous Wire. 1 In general, the basic unalloyed zinc technologies may be grouped under the headings “hot dip galvanizing ” and “electrogalvanizing”. Hot dip practice involves the passage of wire through a molten zinc bath, whereas <b>electrogalvanizing</b> involves electroplating. The galvanized steel coating may involve no further processing. Alternatively, it may be redrawn, or otherwise reworked, chromated or oiled. It {{is important to note}} that the success of these technologies and the serviceability of the final product depend substantially on prior conditioning of the wire. Critical annealing, cleaning and fluxing (in the case of hot dip) processes precede the coating step. Moreover, hot dip coatings are optimized by the maintenance of small additions of aluminum in the zinc bath and by “wiping ” and quenching practices upon emergence from the bath. Modern, in depth presentations on zinc-based steel coating systems may be found in Zinc-Based Steel Coating Systems: Production and Performance. 2 The physical metallurgical basis of zinc-coated steel has been recently reviewed in detail by Marder. 3 It is practical and economical to apply a zinc alloy coating.

The objectives for this work are: 1) to study the effect of different ratios of ethanol/water on the hydrolysis time for a 1 % bis-sulfur silane solution at pH 6, by attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy. The different solutions studied correspond to different ratios of silane/ethanol/water by volume. The study was done following appearance of the siloxane and silanol groups and the disappearance of the ethoxysilane groups. 2) Also studied was the adhesion and corrosion behaviour of bis-sulfur silane (bis[3 -(bis[3 -(triethoxysilyl) propyl]disulfide, DS) in solutions of ethanol/water at pH 4 and 6 and γ-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (MPS) coatings obtained by a two-step process on galvanized steel samples. This coated surface was analysed by reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (FTIR-RA), scanning electron miscroscopy (SEM), and polarization curves. Results obtained at pH 6 were compared with the ones for pH 4. Single lap shear tests were used to contrast the behaviour of anaerobic adhesives on <b>electrogalvanized</b> steel silanized samples. It was observed that higher hydrolysis time was necessary to get good adhesion behaviour if the solution was prepared at pH 4, while at pH 6 the best behaviour was observed for short hydrolysis times...|$|E
