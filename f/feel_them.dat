500|$|In 1957 Francis Bacon based {{a series}} of {{paintings}} on reproductions of Van Gogh's The Painter on the Road to Tarascon, the original of which was destroyed during the Second World War. Bacon was inspired by an image he described as [...] "haunting", and regarded Van Gogh as an alienated outsider, a position which resonated with him. Bacon identified with Van Gogh's theories of art and quoted lines written to Theo: [...] "eal painters do not paint things as they are... hey paint them as they themselves <b>feel</b> <b>them</b> to be." ...|$|E

"As {{her film}} {{brought her to}} life, Santoshi Ma quickly {{became one of the}} most {{important}} and widely worshiped goddesses in India, taking her place in poster-art form in the altar rooms of millions of Hindu homes. [...] Yet it is hard to conceive that Santoshi Ma could have granted such instant satisfaction to so many people had she not been part of a larger and already well-integrated culture of the Goddess. Her new devotees could immediately recognize many of her characteristic moods and attributes, and <b>feel</b> <b>them</b> deeply, because she shared them with other goddesses long since familiar to them." ...|$|E
500|$|Once {{he had the}} sound, {{he rolled}} off the bottom to [...] "take the muddiness out". It was {{actually}} double reverbed; the gated reverb was only on the snares and the toms, {{and the rest of}} the kit as a whole had another plate reverb, which came off the Lexicon 960, for smoothing it out. Swivel said that it actually took him five minutes. According to him, the sound obtained was [...] "a little unorthodox" [...] and therefore, he tried to refine it. Beyoncé thought that it was better the way Swivel did it originally. Swivel commented, [...] "... and in all honesty, whatever works first is usually going to work best. You end up finding something you like about it, and that's where the emotional attachment to a sound comes into play." [...] Swivel often replaces or augments sounds with samples, trying to realise the producer's vision. Similarly in [...] "I Care", he added a couple of kicks underneath the original kick and pitched them down an octave, so that [...] " [...] could not hear them but could <b>feel</b> <b>them</b> on big speakers." [...] Swivel further said that it started with [...] "a dark, almost warehouse‑sounding" [...] kick, and he then added a little thump to it.|$|E

2500|$|Grant's {{article in}} the February 1885 issue of Century became {{the basis of his}} chapter on Shiloh in his memoirs, which were {{published}} in 1886, and influenced many later accounts of Wallace's actions {{on the first day of}} battle. Grant acknowledged in his memoirs: [...] "If the position of our front had not changed, the road which Wallace took would have been somewhat shorter to our right than the River road." [...] Wallace's account of the events appeared in his autobiography, which was published posthumously in 1906. Despite his later fame and fortune as the writer of Ben-Hur, Wallace continued to lament, [...] "Shiloh and its slanders! Will the world ever acquit me of them? If I were guilty I would not <b>feel</b> <b>them</b> as keenly." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lyman Brewer {{suggests}} that the first recorded account of ventricular fibrillation dates {{as far back as}} 1500 BC, and {{can be found in the}} Ebers papyrus of ancient Egypt. The extract recorded 3500 years ago may even date from as far back as 3500 BC. It states: [...] "When the heart is diseased, its work is imperfectly performed: the vessels proceeding from the heart become inactive, so that you cannot <b>feel</b> <b>them</b> … if the heart trembles, has little power and sinks, the disease is advanced and death is near." [...] A book authored by Jo Miles {{suggests that}} it may even go back farther. Tests done on frozen remains found in the Himalayas seemed fairly conclusive that the first known case of ventricular fibrillation dates back to at least 2500 BC.|$|E
2500|$|Ionesco, however, hated Sartre bitterly. Ionesco accused Sartre of {{supporting}} Communism but ignoring the atrocities committed by Communists; he wrote Rhinoceros as {{a criticism of}} blind conformity, whether it be to Nazism or Communism; {{at the end of}} the play, one man remains on Earth resisting transformation into a rhinoceros [...] Sartre criticized Rhinoceros by questioning: [...] "Why is there one man who resists? At least we could learn why, but no, we learn not even that. He resists because he is there". [...] Sartre's criticism highlights a primary difference between the Theatre of the Absurd and existentialism: the Theatre of the Absurd shows the failure of man without recommending a solution. In a 1966 interview, Claude Bonnefoy, comparing the Absurdists to Sartre and Camus, said to Ionesco, [...] "It seems to me that Beckett, Adamov and yourself started out less from philosophical reflections or a return to classical sources, than from first-hand experience and a desire to find a new theatrical expression that would enable you to render this experience in all its acuteness and also its immediacy. If Sartre and Camus thought out these themes, you expressed them in a far more vital contemporary fashion". Ionesco replied, [...] "I have the feeling that these writers – who are serious and important – were talking about absurdity and death, but that they never really lived these themes, that they did not <b>feel</b> <b>them</b> within themselves in an almost irrational, visceral way, that all this was not deeply inscribed in their language. With them it was still rhetoric, eloquence. With Adamov and Beckett it really is a very naked reality that is conveyed through the apparent dislocation of language".|$|E
