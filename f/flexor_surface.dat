5000|$|The horse has a {{sesamoid bone}} called the navicular bone, {{located within the}} hoof, that lies on the palmar aspect of the coffin joint between the second phalanx and third phalanx (coffin bone). The navicular bone in the horse is {{supported}} by the distal sesamoidean impar ligament and two collateral sesamoidean ligaments. The navicular bursa is located between the <b>flexor</b> <b>surface</b> of the navicular bone and the deep digital flexor tendon, which runs between the bursa and the distal phalanx. [...] The central tarsal bone in the hock of the horse is homologous and analogous to the navicular bone of the human foot, and thus the navicular bone in the horse is a different structure from the eponymously labeled bone in humans. The navicular region is an important structure in relation to lameness, particularly in the front feet, and is involved with a significant disease process called navicular disease or navicular syndrome. Recently much of the original literature concerning navicular disease has been called into question, particularly the significance of radiographic changes as a sole diagnostic criterion. Navicular syndrome may be responsible for as much as 1/3 of all cases of lameness in horses, but radiographic changes in the navicular bone do not always provide a definitive diagnosis. Newer imaging techniques have shown that damage to the soft tissues in the region may be significant contributors to lameness and that multiple causes may result in visible lameness.|$|E

The anatomic bases have been laid down about morphometry of the navicular bones and their variations according to limbs, after corrections have been made for morphologic type, gender, weight, size and age. All {{the dimensions of the}} navicular bone (except for the thickness) were larger in the fore limb. This phenomenon probably reflects an attempt to compensate for the greater forces exerted upon the fore limbs during exercise and at rest. Navicular bones {{collected from}} the four limbs of 61 sound horses were studied and the anatomic bases were described for histomorphometry of the fore and rear navicular bones. Fore navicular bones possess less cortical bone {{at the level of the}} articular surface, as well as at the level of the <b>flexor</b> <b>surface</b> and proximal border, but larger amounts of cancellous bone. Articular and <b>flexor</b> <b>surface</b> cortical bone show a larger porosity in the fore navicular bones and a larger amount of mineralized cartilage. The mineralized portion for distal impar- and collateral sesamoidean ligaments are also larger for the fore navicular bones.

40|$|Foot pain is an {{important}} cause of lameness in horses. When horses with foot pain have no detectable radiographic abnormalities, soft-tissue assessment remains a diagnostic challenge without magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Ultrasonography can provide an alternative to MR imaging when that modality is not available but the extent of changes that might be seen has not been characterized. We reviewed the ultrasonographic findings in 39 horses with lameness responding positively to anesthesia of the palmar digital nerves and without radiographically detectable osseous abnormalities. Thirty of the 39 horses had lesions affecting the deep digital flexor tendon (DDFT), 27 had abnormalities in the distal interphalangeal joint of which six had a visible abnormality in the collateral ligament. Ultrasonographic abnormalities were seen in the podotrochlear bursa in 22 horses and in the ligaments of the navicular bone in two horses.

40|$|Summary: A case of {{skeletal}} muscle tuberculosis with metastatic cold abscesses at unusual sites is reported. Tuberculous disease in muscle may assume three forms (Adam et al 1962). (1) Local exten-sion from a neighbouring focus. (2) Solitary metastatic tuberculous abscess or nodular tuber-culosis. (3) Tuberculous myositis. Tuberculosis of {{skeletal muscle}} {{is a very}} rare entity. There are infrequent reports in the lite-rature. Because of its rarity we report here {{a case of the}} tuberculosis of skeletal muscle with cold abscess at the unusual site. Case Report Female aged 18 years was admitted in this Hospital with the chief complaints of pain and swelling of the right wrist and left knee joints for five months, low grade fever and low backache for same duration. Past and family history was non contributory. On examination she was a thin built lady, pulse was 120 /min. regular good in volume. Blood pressure was 120 / 70 mm Hg.
