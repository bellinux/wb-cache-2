Now he knows the way he will express himself will be specifically through a house. At this stage he may sit down with his wife, or real estate agent, and clarifies exactly how he wants his house to be. This stage includes Chochma (Wisdom) of Aztilus which is when he creates the general picture of what he wants in the abstract, [...] "a warm home". Binah (Understanding) of Atzilus involves figuring out what are the components of such a home; everything he wants the house to be with all their details. In A"K he only knew what types of homes are apporpirate with what kind of person. Here he actually decides where he will <b>fit</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture.</b> Here he also decides what is practical based on how much money he has and what is available etc. Based on all of these things he comes up with the Zeir Anpin (Z"A-"the Small Face"-Emotions) of Atzilus: This stage is the picture of what things are good and what are bad. Here he sets up what things will bring him closer to his goal (his dream house) and what things will bring him further. He will have Chesed (a love) for things he will like. He will have Gevurah (a fear or hate) for things he will not like. He will have Tiferet (Beauty) for the compromises he makes (or the beauty that results) and Netzach (feeling of victory in spite of challenges) to want to go and get what he wants, and the Hod to not settle for something less than he wants. He will have a Yesod, which forms the compromise of how he will actually interact with everyone resulting from the interplay between his Netzach and Hod. This results in Malchut ("Kingdom" [...] or actualization), which is the stage at which he will talk to himself about what he likes and doesnt like. And he will talk about what he is actually going to do. Finally, all of the above will lead to his creation of his Malchus of Atzilus i.e. he will actually tell the real estate agent what he wants, what he will settle for and what he will not, what he likes hates etc. The desires are all set up now, but still the real building process of the house has not occurred.|$|E

40|$|Making {{multimedia}} assets on the {{one hand}} first-class objects on the Semantic Web, while keeping them on the other hand conforming to existing multimedia standards is a non-trivial task. Most proprietary media asset formats are binary, optimized for streaming or storage. However, the semantics carried by the media assets are not accessible directly. In addition, multimedia description standards lack the expressiveness to gain a semantic understanding of the media assets. There exists an array of requirements both regarding media assets, and the Semantic Web already. Based on a critical review of these requirements we investigate how ontology languages <b>fit</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture.</b> We finally analyse the usefulness of formal accounts to describe spatio-temporal aspects of multimedia assets in a practical context...|$|E
40|$|We {{study by}} the perturbative Functional Renormalization Group (FRG) the Random Field and Random Anisotropy O(N) models near $d= 4 $, the lower {{critical}} dimension of ferromagnetism. The long-distance physics is controlled by zero-temperature fixed points at which the renormalized effective action is nonanalytic. We obtain the beta functions at 2 -loop order, showing that despite the nonanalytic character of the renormalized effective action, the theory is perturbatively renormalizable at this order. The physical results obtained at 2 -loop level, most notably concerning the breakdown of dimensional reduction at the critical point and the stability of quasi-long range order in $d< 4 $, are shown to <b>fit</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> predicted by our recent non-perturbative FRG approach.

40|$|ABSTRACT This {{essay is}} an {{introduction}} to Time and Reality I, {{the first part of}} a special issue dedicated to the philosophy of time. Here I outline a number of new trends in philosophical theorizing about time, detailing how the various contributions <b>fit</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture.</b> I argue {{that there has been a}} potentially misleading tendency to separate the debate over the passage of time from the debate over the reality of tense. This has obscured a number of interesting philosophical questions. One of the aims of this volume is to bring these two issues together, where they belong. I argue that many contributions to it go in the right direction. The contributions to this volume also establish uncharted philosophical junctures between Metaphysics, Aesthetics, Morality, and the Philosophy of Mind...|$|E

40|$|In {{this note}} we revive a {{transformation}} that {{was introduced by}} H. S.

This transformation {{can be considered as}} an analog of the Szegő mapping but {{it is based on the}} Cayley transform, which relates the upper half-plane to the unit disc. For example, it will be shown that, when applying the Wall transformation, instead of OPRL, we get a sequence of orthogonal rational functions that satisfy three-term recurrence relation of the form (H-λ J) u= 0, where u is a semi-infinite vector, whose entries are the rational functions. Besides, J and H are Hermitian Jacobi matrices for which a version of the Denisov-Rakhmanov theorem holds true.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of many complex problems and complex dynamic systems {{suggests that there}} are dependencies between high complexity and properties of the underlying structures, as the existence of large grids, non-regularities and inhomogeneous structures and irregular flows of information. These observations indicate the existence of a unified criterion that defines structural elements of complex entities. We present the idea of such a criterion basing on concepts from computational and parametric complexity theory and analyse its impact in financial risk management. It is shown that selected real-world problems in risk managements are complex in the sense of NP-completeness. Here the criterion is used to analyse the structural reasons for the proved complexity. We show how selected risk management methods <b>fit</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>picture</b> of our complexity criterion and derive some implications for the future generation of risk management methods from the viewpoint of complexity. complexity, risk management, credit risk, operational risk, NP-hard, tree width, local structure, information flow...|$|E

40|$|This article {{addresses}} some of {{the issues}} arising from the continuing research and debate on open access (OA) publishing, primarily from the perspective of an academic in the field of humanities. As an academic, the author feels it is essential that scholars embrace the responsibility of being part of the process that reconsiders how to publish their research, and that they recognize they have a key role to play amongst a variety of stakeholders. The launch of the Open Library of Humanities (OLH) in early 2013 and its growing momentum as a scholarly-led movement over the last 12 months demonstrates that there is an increasing awareness amongst the academic community in the humanities of what is required to build a new kind of publishing model.
