Asked in 2007 how she feels when criticized from within the movement, she said: [...] "Somebody has to push the envelope. If you say something that someone already agrees with, then what's the point, and so we make some more conservative animal protection organizations uncomfortable; they don't want to be associated with us because it will be embarrassing for them, and I understand that. Our own members write to us sometimes and say, 'Oh why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>this?</b> I don't want anyone to know I'm a PETA member.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Butler was {{scheduled}} to have made his directorial debut in January 1979 with Adrift & Beyond, but it never came to fruition. Butler turned down Coppola's offer to direct the photography for Apocalypse Now (1979). Butler has worked in films during the 2000s, such as Frailty (2002) and Funny Money (2006). Bill Paxton, {{the director of the}} former film, said, [...] "I was excited when Bill Butler who was the cinematographer on such classic films as Jaws and The Conversation came aboard as my director of photography for Frailty. And I really picked his brain, always asking 'how <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> shot?' and 'how did you figure that out?'" [...] Bill Butler recounts his initial conversations with Paxton about the script: [...] "I liked the direction he wanted to take, and he inspired me to share his vision. It was a great collaboration." ...|$|E

60|$|Equal {{justice to}} the South, it is said, {{requires}} us to consent to the extension of slavery to new countries. That is to say, inasmuch as you do not object to my taking my hog to Nebraska, therefore I must not object to your taking your slave. Now, I admit that this is perfectly logical {{if there is no}} difference between hogs and negroes. But while you thus require me to deny the humanity of the negro, I wish to ask whether you of the South, yourselves, have ever been willing to do as much? It is kindly provided that of all those who come into the world only a small percentage are natural tyrants. That percentage is no larger in the slave States than in the free. The great majority South, as well as North, have human sympathies, of which they can no more divest themselves than they can of their sensibility to physical pain. These sympathies in the bosoms of the Southern people manifest, in many ways, their sense of the wrong of slavery, and their consciousness that, after all, there is humanity in the negro. If they deny this, let me address them a few plain questions. In 1820 you (the South) joined the North, almost unanimously, in declaring the African slave trade piracy, and in annexing to it the punishment of death. Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>this?</b> If you did not feel that it was wrong, why did you join in providing that men should be hung for it?
