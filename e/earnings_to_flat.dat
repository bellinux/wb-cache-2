40|$|Previous {{empirical}} research on informativeness of earnings {{has focused on}} stockholders, and has not examined earnings informativeness for stockholders and bondholders. Stockholders are residual claimants and bondholders are fixed claimants, the informativeness of earnings should differ for {{these two types of}} investors. When firm is financially strong, earnings changes should be of limited relevance to bondholders, but should be relevance to bondholders. In contrast, as the likelihood of financial distress increase, stockholder’s limited liability allows them to abandon the firm <b>to</b> bondholder and <b>earnings</b> change should be increasingly important to bondholders and less important <b>to</b> shareholders because <b>earnings</b> provide information on firm value. This suggest that the effect of <b>earnings</b> <b>to</b> stock return should decrease as the firm’s financial strength declines, while the effect of <b>earnings</b> <b>to</b> bond return should increase. In contrast, when firm’s financial condition is strong, the effect of <b>earnings</b> <b>to</b> stock return is higher than the effect of <b>earnings</b> <b>to</b> bond return. We refer to this as the liquidation option hypothesis. The objective {{of this study is to}} examine liquidation option hypothesis. We use bond rating as financial condition’s measurement. Consistent with our hypotheses, we find that the effect of unexpected <b>earnings</b> <b>to</b> stock return is significant when firm is financially strong but the effect of unexpected <b>earnings</b> <b>to</b> bond return is not significant. When financial distress increase, the effect of unexpected <b>earnings</b> <b>to</b> stock return is not significant but the effect of unexpected <b>earnings</b> <b>to</b> bond return is significan...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} role {{and the effect of}} the life cycle theory on {{explanation}} of dividend payout policy in Tehran Stock exchange listed companies over the period 2006 - 2011. For measuring the firm’s life cycle, two criteria namely retained <b>earnings</b> <b>to</b> equity ratio and retained <b>earnings</b> <b>to</b> assets ratio have been used as proxies of firm’s life cycle. The findings of this research show that only retained <b>earnings</b> <b>to</b> assets ratio has a meaningful and positive effect on dividend payout policy; In the companies that are growing, retained <b>earnings</b> <b>to</b> assets ratio is low; Whereas this ratio is high in the more mature companies and these firms have abundant retained earnings, hence they are good candidates to pay dividends. However, there was no meaningful relationship between another life cycle criteria namely retained <b>earnings</b> <b>to</b> equity ratio and dividend payout policy...|$|R

The main contribution of the paper is to extend the approach suggested by Chan and Chen (1991) to other trading strategies and accounting-based risk measures. Consistent with the hypothesis developed, the empirical results indicate that earnings-to-price ratios lose their ability to predict stock returns when a firm's financial and business risks are {{used to measure the}} risk of its stock. The results also indicate that these accounting-based risk measures can weaken but not totally negate the ability of the cash-flow <b>earnings</b> <b>to</b> stock price ratio to predict risk-adjusted stock returns.

40|$|Reported {{earnings}} play {{an important}} role in portraying a company's economic performance. Hence, managers have incentives <b>to</b> manage <b>earnings</b> in order <b>to</b> avoid losses and earnings decreases. It has been found that firms willingly manage their <b>earnings</b> in order <b>to</b> meet or exceed earnings targets. The purpose of this study is to examine whether managers manage <b>earnings</b> <b>to</b> avoid losses and earnings decreases. We investigate whether Malaysian managers engage in <b>earnings</b> management <b>to</b> avoid losses and decreases in earnings. In addition we examine differences in tendency to avoid losses and decreases in earnings across industries.

This evidence has implications for interpreting multiple regression models that relate abnormal returns <b>to</b> unexpected <b>earnings</b> and other information variables. 1. Introduction an...|$|R
