50|$|Theileria parva is {{a species}} of parasites, named in honour of Arnold Theiler, that causes <b>East</b> <b>Coast</b> <b>fever</b> (theileriosis) in cattle, a costly disease in Africa. The main vector for T. parva is the tick Rhipicephalus appendiculatus. Theiler found that <b>East</b> <b>Coast</b> <b>fever</b> {{was not the same}} as redwater, but caused by a {{different}} protozoan.|$|E

5000|$|The {{disease was}} once {{considered}} as [...] "benign" [...] in the literature, {{in comparison to}} <b>East</b> <b>Coast</b> <b>fever.</b> With the introduction of European breeds into the region, however, it could become of major economic incidence.|$|E
50|$|A form of <b>East</b> <b>Coast</b> <b>fever</b> called {{corridor}} {{disease is}} observed when the organism {{is transmitted from}} the African buffalo to cattle. Another form, called January disease, only occurs over the winter months in Zimbabwe due to the tick lifecycle.|$|E
50|$|<b>East</b> <b>Coast</b> <b>fever</b> (theileriosis) is {{a disease}} of cattle, sheep and goats caused by the {{protozoan}} parasite Theileria parva.

50|$|<b>East</b> <b>Coast</b> <b>fever</b> is {{probably}} the most important livestock diseases in Africa, causing an annual loss of 1.1 million cattle and $168 million in 1992. It is found in Sudan, South Africa, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, and Swaziland. The primary vector for T. parva is Rhipicephalus appendiculatus.|$|E
50|$|Many Rhipicephalus are of economic, medical, and {{veterinary}} importance {{because they}} are vectors of pathogens. They transmit the pathogens that cause the animal and human diseases <b>East</b> <b>Coast</b> <b>fever,</b> anaplasmosis, babesiosis, rickettsiosis, Boutonneuse fever, Lyme disease, Q fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, and they inject a neurotoxin in their bite that leads to tick-caused paralysis.|$|E
50|$|Theileria is a genus of parasites {{that belongs}} to the phylum Apicomplexa and {{is closely related to}} Plasmodium. Two Theileria species, T. annulata and T. parva, are {{important}} cattle parasites. T. annulata causes tropical theileriosis and T. parva causes <b>East</b> <b>Coast</b> <b>fever.</b> Theileria are transmitted by ticks.The genomes of T. orientalis Shintoku, Theileria equi WA, Theileria annulata Ankara and Theileria parva Muguga have been sequenced and published.|$|E

50|$|The 2011 West <b>Coast</b> <b>Fever</b> {{season was}} the fourth season that the West <b>Coast</b> <b>Fever</b> contested the ANZ Championship, and the fifteenth year of the franchise's {{competitive}} history.

The 2011 season saw little change in the team's struggling history in the ANZ Championship, finishing in ninth place.|$|R
50|$|Control of {{the disease}} also relies on tick control and the {{development}} of disease-resistant ticks. Control of ticks of domestic animals is a major concern in tropical countries with large livestock populations, especially in the endemic area of <b>East</b> <b>Coast</b> <b>fever.</b> Chemical pesticides (acaricides) are applied in dipping baths or spray races, and use of breeds of cattle with good ability to acquire immune resistance to the vector ticks are used to control the measure.|$|E
50|$|Theiler was {{the first}} Director of the Onderstepoort Veterinary Research Institute, outside Pretoria. This {{institute}} under his leadership carried out research on African horse sickness, sleeping sickness, malaria, <b>East</b> <b>Coast</b> <b>fever</b> (Theileria parva) and tick-borne diseases such as redwater, heartwater and biliary. The University of Pretoria Faculty of Veterinary Science was established there in 1920 which enabled veterinarians to train locally for the first time. Theiler became the first dean of this faculty.|$|E
50|$|Other {{than the}} buparvaquones, other {{chemotherapeutic}} options are the parvaquones, e.g. Clexon.

The ultimate factor that causes death is pulmonary edema.In May 2010, a vaccine to protect cattle against <b>East</b> <b>Coast</b> <b>fever</b> reportedly had been approved and registered by the governments of Kenya, Malawi and Tanzania. This consists of cryopreserved sporozoites from crushed ticks, but it is expensive and can cause disease.|$|E

50|$|Buparvaquone is a hydroxynaphthoquinone {{antiprotozoal}} drug {{related to}} parvaquone and atovaquone. It is a promising compound for the therapy and prophylaxis {{of all forms}} of theileriosis. Buparvaquone has been shown to have anti-leishmanial activity in vitro. It can be used to treat bovine <b>East</b> <b>Coast</b> <b>fever</b> protozoa in vitro, along with the only other substance known - Peganum harmala. It is the only really effective commercial therapeutic product against bovine theileriosis, where it has been used since the late 1980s.|$|E
50|$|In 1902 {{there was}} an {{outbreak}} of what was initially thought to be Redwater in the Transvaal. Arnold Theiler sent specimens of Blue tick (Boophilus decoloratus, now known as Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) decoloratus), known to be the usual vectors for Redwater, taken from infected cattle to Lounsbury in Cape Town. There, surprisingly, they caused no disease when introduced to healthy cattle, leading to the discovery that the disease was not Redwater, but a new protozoan parasite <b>East</b> <b>Coast</b> <b>fever</b> or Theileria parva transmitted by the tick Rhipicephalus appendiculatus.|$|E
50|$|By {{the age of}} 22 Stanley was {{the largest}} native trader in Eastern Mashonaland. He was a great traveller, opening up trade routes right across Africa, notably in Mozambique and Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) where he used his ox carts to supply the trading posts of the Great White Hunters. He {{explored}} the centre part of Mozambique for the Portuguese, returning only to find his business ruined through the new cattle disease <b>East</b> <b>Coast</b> <b>fever,</b> then known as African Coast fever. An outbreak of Rinderpest in the 1890s had previously killed 80 to 90 percent of all cattle in Southern Africa. Cecil Rhodes had now imported 1000 new cattle from Australia, which were landed at Beira in Mozambique and were allowed to mix with the local cattle, exposing them to this new disease. <b>East</b> <b>Coast</b> <b>Fever</b> broke {{out as soon as}} Rhodes's herd reached Umtali and rapidly infected numbers of local cattle, ultimately spreading throughout the whole country. (It wasn't until 1902 that it was determined that this new disease was spread by ticks from the imported cattle). The Rhodesian Chartered Company's government was bombarded with requests and petitions to destroy any and every other beast that came into contact with the dead cattle, to stamp out the plague at the start, but the government claimed it was just a bad outbreak of redwater fever that would soon subside.|$|E
