5|$|Set reports dated April 2012 {{recorded}} that scenes {{would be}} set on Hashima Island, an abandoned <b>island</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> coast of Nagasaki, Japan. In actuality, the scene was set on an unnamed <b>island</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> coast of Macau, though based on the real-life Hashima. Sam Mendes explained that the location was a hybrid of a set and computer-generated images. Production chose to include the Hashima model after Daniel Craig met with Swedish film-maker Thomas Nordanstad whilst shooting The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo in Stockholm. Nordanstad, who produced a short documentary on Hashima Island in 2002 entitled Hashima, recalled Craig taking extensive notes on the island {{at the time of}} the meeting, but was unaware of his interest in it until Skyfall was released.|$|E

He was captured in 1473 after conquering St Michael's Mount, an <b>island</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> southwest coast of England.

At the time, Honduras itself was a part of Spain's Kingdom of Guatemala, and Spanish settlements dominated the mainland of Central America. Claiborne optimistically called his new colony Rich Island, but Spanish power in the area was too strong and the colony was destroyed in 1642.|$|E

5|$|In southeastern Asia, the durian {{has been}} {{cultivated}} for centuries {{at the village}} level, probably since the late 18th century, and commercially since the mid-20th century.

These indicated that the location of the South Magnetic Pole was, as expected, within Victoria Land, but further north and further west than had previously been assumed. The party then sailed for home, crossing the Antarctic Circle on 28 February. On 1 April, news of their safe return was sent by telegram from Bluff, New Zealand.|$|E

5|$|The geology of Ireland is diverse. Different regions contain rocks {{belonging}} to different geologic periods, dating {{as far back}} almost 2 billion years. The oldest known Irish rock is about 1.7 billion years old and is found on Inishtrahull <b>Island</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> north coast of Inishowen and on the mainland at Annagh Head on the Mullet Peninsula. The newer formations are the drumlins and glacial valleys {{as a result of}} the last ice age, and the sinkholes and cave formations in the limestone regions of Clare.|$|E

5|$|Fossilized {{porbeagle}} remains {{are known}} from Late Miocene epoch (c. 7.2 Ma) deposits in Belgium and the Netherlands, Pliocene epoch (5.3–2.6 Ma) deposits in Belgium, Spain, and Chile, and Pleistocene epoch (2.6 Ma to 12,000 BP) deposits in the Netherlands. However, Lamna teeth that closely {{resemble those of}} the porbeagle {{have been found in}} the La Meseta Formation on Seymour <b>Island</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Antarctic Peninsula, which date to the middle to late Eocene epoch (50–34 Ma). There is much taxonomic confusion regarding Lamna in the fossil record due to the high degree of variability in adult tooth morphology within species.|$|E

5|$|Mackintosh {{returned}} to England in June 1909. On {{reporting to the}} P & O, he was informed that due to his impaired sight he was discharged. Without immediate prospects of employment, he agreed, early in 1910, to accompany Douglas Mawson (who {{had served as a}} geologist on the Nimrod Expedition and was later to lead the Australasian Antarctic Expedition) on a trip to Hungary, to survey a potential goldfield which Shackleton was hoping would form the basis of a lucrative business venture. Despite a promising report from Mawson, nothing came of this. Mackintosh later launched his own treasure-hunting expedition to Cocos <b>Island</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Panama Pacific coast, but again returned home empty-handed.|$|E
