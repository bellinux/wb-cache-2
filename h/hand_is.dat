5|$|Because of {{its heavy}} use and {{practice}} by magicians, sleight of <b>hand</b> <b>is</b> often confused as {{a branch of}} magic, but is in reality a separate genre of entertainment, as many artists practice sleight of hand without the slightest interest in magic.|$|E

5|$|A {{large number}} of {{spin-off}} video games have also been made for the Final Fantasy series. These spin-off games vary in their relation to the main series; the first, The Final Fantasy Legend games, were marketed as related in North America but {{were considered to be}} the first three games of the SaGa series in their native Japan, and later SaGa games released outside Japan bear no Final Fantasy branding. Dissidia Final Fantasy, on the other <b>hand,</b> <b>is</b> a fighting game using characters from the main series exclusively. Overall, more than 30 games have been released as spin-offs of the main Final Fantasy series, many within their own sub-series.|$|E
50|$|Non-standard poker <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> <b>hands</b> which <b>are</b> not {{recognized}} by official poker rules but {{are made by}} house rules. Non-standard hands usually appear in games using wild cards or bugs. Other terms for nonstandard <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> special <b>hands</b> or freak hands. Because the <b>hands</b> <b>are</b> defined by house rules, the composition and ranking of these <b>hands</b> <b>is</b> subject to variation. Any player participating in a game with non-standard <b>hands</b> should <b>be</b> sure to determine the exact {{rules of the game}} before play begins.|$|R

5|$|Although being mostly {{used for}} {{entertainment}} and comedy purposes, sleight of <b>hand</b> <b>is</b> also notoriously used to cheat at casinos and gambling facilities throughout the world. Common ways to professionally cheat at card games using {{sleight of hand}} include palming, switching, ditching, and stealing cards from the table. Such techniques involve extreme misdirection and years of practice. For these reasons, the term sleight of hand frequently carries negative associations of dishonesty and deceit at many gambling halls, and many magicians known {{around the world are}} publicly banned from casinos, such as British mentalist and close-up magician Derren Brown, who is banned from every casino in Britain.|$|E
5|$|Although quick {{draw and}} hip {{shooting}} {{was an important}} skill in the West, {{only a handful of}} historically known gunslingers were known to be fast, such as Luke Short, John Wesley Hardin, Wild Bill Hickok, Doc Holliday, and Billy the Kid. Shooting a pistol with one <b>hand</b> <b>is</b> normally associated with gunslingers, and is also a standard for them of the era to carry two guns and fire ambidextrously. Capt. Jonathan R. Davis carried two revolvers in his iconic gunfight, while Jesse James himself carried over half a dozen revolvers in many of his gunfights.|$|E
5|$|At the FBI safe house, {{a police}} car arrives with Modell. Modell enters the room that Linda is in and locks the door behind him. Mulder tells Scully {{the news of the}} therapist's death and urges her to keep Linda away from a phone. At the safe house, Skinner finds Linda's room door locked. He kicks the door down to find Modell and Linda, with Modell calmly saying that he has a gun. Without hesitation, Skinner shoots Modell when he sees a gun in Modell's hand, but once he is on the ground Skinner sees that his <b>hand</b> <b>is</b> curled into the shape of the gun.|$|E

5|$|Bupropion {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{prescribed}} antidepressants, and the available evidence indicates that it is effective in clinical depression — as effective as several other widely prescribed drugs, including fluoxetine (Prozac) and paroxetine (Paxil), although trends favoring the efficacy of escitalopram (Lexapro), sertraline (Zoloft) and venlafaxine (Effexor) over bupropion have been observed. Mirtazapine (Remeron), on the other <b>hand</b> <b>is</b> significantly more effective than bupropion. Bupropion has several features that distinguish it from other antidepressants: for instance, unlike the majority of antidepressants, it does not usually cause sexual dysfunction. Bupropion treatment also is not associated with the sleepiness or weight gain that may be produced by other antidepressants.|$|E
5|$|During his {{re-examination}} of Iguanodon, David Norman {{was able}} to show that this posture was unlikely, because the long tail was stiffened with ossified tendons. To get the tripodal pose, the tail would literally have to be broken. Putting the animal in a horizontal posture makes many aspects of the arms and pectoral girdle more understandable. For example, the <b>hand</b> <b>is</b> relatively immobile, with the three central fingers grouped together, bearing hoof-like phalanges, and able to hyperextend. This would have allowed them to bear weight. The wrist is also relatively immobile, and the arms and shoulder bones robust. These features all suggest that the animal spent time on all fours.|$|E
5|$|Harmonia is a Japanese post-apocalyptic visual novel {{developed}} by Key, {{a brand of}} VisualArt's. It was released on September 23, 2016 for Windows on Steam, and was available in English before its Japanese release on December 29, 2016. The story {{is set in a}} world where artificially intelligent, emotional androids called Phiroids were developed before a rapid decline in human civilization.

5|$|In major-thirds tuning, the {{chromatic}} scale is arranged on three consecutive strings in four consecutive frets. This four-fret arrangement facilitates the left-hand technique for classical (Spanish) guitar: For each hand position of four frets, the <b>hand</b> <b>is</b> stationary and the fingers move, each finger {{being responsible for}} one fret. Consequently, three hand-positions (covering frets 1–4, 5–8, and 9–12) partition the fingerboard of classical guitar, which has exactly 12 frets.|$|E
5|$|Montauran, on {{the other}} <b>hand,</b> <b>is</b> devoted wholly to the royalist cause, and chafes against the ignorant nobles {{supporting}} it.

He gives up the cause for Marie, but only {{as a result of}} an unclear series of events, the product of everyone's intertwined double-crossing.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the past}} century, batik making in Sri Lanka has become firmly established. The Sri Lankan batik {{industry}} is a small scale industry which can employ individual design talent and mainly deals with foreign customers for profit. It is now the most visible of the island's crafts with galleries and factories, large and small, having sprung up in many tourist areas. Rows of small stalls selling batiks can be found all along Hikkaduwa's Galle Road strip. Mahawewa, on the other <b>hand,</b> <b>is</b> famous for its batik factories.|$|E
5|$|Some pundits {{have argued}} that the top was not in fact Cobb's totem, {{rendering}} the discussion irrelevant. They say that the top was Mal's totem; Cobb's was his wedding ring, as he can be seen wearing it whenever he is in a dream and without it whenever he isn't. As he hands his passport to the immigration officer, his <b>hand</b> <b>is</b> shown with no ring; thus he was conclusively in reality when seeing his children. Furthermore, the children were portrayed by different actors, indicating they had aged.|$|E
5|$|Surnames that mention {{animals can}} also be toponymic, the names Horscroft, Horsfall, Horsley and Horstead for example all {{denoting}} people who came from these villages associated with horses.

5|$|The chapel on {{the upper}} floor became a store room in the early 1980s for pieces being sold off. The stained glass window of the chapel, with the Spencer crest, dates to 1588, and was brought to Althorp from Wormleigton. The organ on the other <b>hand</b> <b>is</b> far more recent, {{acquired}} from the parish of Meriden in the 1990s. A number of earlier occupants of Althorp, particularly George John and Frederick, were devout Christians and would preach in the chapel, and Robert, 6th Earl Spencer would hold a daily service here. It is still used for family christenings, and for services at Christmas, Easter and Harvest Thanksgiving.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of {{the entrance to the}} Duomo of Salò is copiously documented between 1506 and 1509. The design was by Cairano, most likely in collaboration with Antonio Mangiacavalli. Cairano's <b>hand</b> <b>is</b> evident in the figures of the Father, St. Peter and St. John the Baptist, leaving the Virgin to his collaborator, while the Angel of the Annunciation and two small busts in the spandrels appear to be a joint work. The architectural parts were accomplished by different stonemasons as recorded in the documents relating to the workshops, including Mangiacavalli's son. The portal was put in place by August 1508, and embellishments and other work ended at the beginning of 1509.|$|E
