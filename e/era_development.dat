50|$|Gelder {{had entered}} the {{architectural}} profession {{at the time of}} the Victorian <b>era</b> <b>development</b> of Hull. According to one source it was largely thanks to Gelder’s ability and energy that Hull was a city transformed - with old buildings removed, new wide streets introduced and attractive shops and public offices erected. Under Gelder’s supervision, Hull was being hailed as one of the country’s finest cities with the slums and disorder of the Victorian city giving way to broad, straight thoroughfares. During Gelder’s time the city centre was reconstructed and a new bridge, the Drypool Bridge, was built across the River Hull. In recognition of Gelder’s contributions, the new road built through the city centre to link with this bridge was named Alfred Gelder Street. In the 1930s Gelder was associated with the works to transform Queen’s Dock into Queen’s Gardens. One of Gelder and Kitchen’s specialisms was the design of flour mills and oilseed crushing mills at a time when Hull was a major European centre for the industry. One of the firm’s most famous clients for its revolutionary roller mill was Joseph Rank who, like Gelder, was a noted Methodist and Gelder also did architectural work for Joseph Rank’s son, the industrialist and film producer, J Arthur Rank. His devout attachment to Methodism caused Gelder to design numerous chapels, including the Brunswick Chapel on Holderness Road in 1890 and the Princes Avenue Chapel in 1904. As well as in Hull, there were commissions for chapels and flour mills, fromall over the country.|$|E

(It would not become standard equipment until 1926, on a Rickenbacker.)Between 1907 and 1912 in the United States, the high-wheel motor buggy (resembling the horse buggy of before 1900) was in its heyday, with over seventy-five makers including Holsman (Chicago), IHC (Chicago), and Sears (which sold via catalog); the high-wheeler would be killed by the Model T. In 1912, Hupp (in the United States, supplied by Hale & Irwin) and BSA (in the UK) pioneered the use of all-steel bodies, joined in 1914 by Dodge (who produced Model T bodies). While it would be another two decades before all-steel bodies would be standard, the change would mean improved supplies of superior-quality wood for furniture makers.|$|E
50|$|Since its {{inception}} the religion has had involvement in socio-economic development beginning by giving greater freedom to women, promulgating {{the promotion of}} female education as a priority concern, and that involvement was given practical expression by creating schools, agricultural coops, and clinics. The religion entered a new phase of activity when a message of the Universal House of Justice dated 20 October 1983 was released. Bahá'ís were urged to seek out ways, compatible with the Bahá'í teachings, {{in which they could}} become involved in the social and economic development of the communities in which they lived. Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognised Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. For the International Year of the Child Bangladesh Bahá'ís established tutorial schools in three villages. By 1987, the number of officially recognised development projects had increased to 1482. The Bahá'ís in Bangladesh work to promote their interests and contributions to Bangladesh. Even early on there were village level schools run by the local assembly in the Jessore area. In 1981 the second Bangladesh National Baha'i Women's Conference took place attracting Bahá'í women from Bangladesh, India, Iran, Malaysia and Italy. In 1995 three national newspapers published articles on a public meeting sponsored by the local spiritual assembly of Khulna to mark the founding of the United Nations. Tents {{on the grounds of the}} Bahá'í Center there were filled with 50 Bahá'ís and 200 guests who listened to speeches and then enjoyed the performance of songs written by Bahá'í youth on the theme of unity and amity among the nations and races of the earth. Some of the students of the New <b>Era</b> <b>Development</b> Institute, an educational NGO in India run by the Bahá'ís, have come from the Bangladesh Bahá'í community in 1997. In 1988 Bahá'í doctors setup free treatment camps. In addition to work in groups, some individuals have become well known for their contributions to Bangladesh society. Bahá'í Samarendra Nath Goswami, is well known in Bangladesh as Secretary General of the Bangladesh Minority Lawyers Association and senior advocate of Bangladesh Supreme Court and contributed to founding a law journal and two law schools. In 1994, he edited The Principles of Bahá'í Personal Law which was published by the Bangladesh Law Times. In the early 1990s, Baha'i law was included in the law curriculum of Dhaka University. Payam Akhavan, Bahá'í and a renowned human rights lawyer represented Sheikh Hasina (a once and again Prime Minister of Bangladesh).|$|E
