5|$|<b>Edgar</b> Quinet {{continued}} her {{service in the}} eastern Mediterranean {{after the end of}} the war in 1918. During the culmination of the Greco-Turkish War that immediately followed World War I, <b>Edgar</b> Quinet rescued 1,200 people from the Great Fire of Smyrna in 1922. In 1925, <b>Edgar</b> Quinet was converted into a training ship. The work lasted until 1927, and included the reduction of her armament to ten of her 194mm guns, the removal of two of her funnels, and a reconstruction of her bridge. Then-Captain François Darlan commanded the ship in 1928. In 1929, <b>Edgar</b> Quinet underwent an overhaul; during this modernization she was fitted with equipment to handle floatplanes for reconnaissance purposes. After returning to service, the ship was assigned as a training ship for cadets from the École Navale (Naval Academy). On 4 January 1930, <b>Edgar</b> Quinet ran aground off the coast of Algeria west of Oran and proved to be a total loss. She sank five days later.|$|E
5|$|In 1098, <b>Edgar</b> of Scotland {{signed a}} treaty with Magnus that settled {{much of the}} {{boundary}} between the Scots and Norwegian claims in the islands. <b>Edgar</b> formally acknowledged the existing situation by giving up his claims to the Hebrides and Kintyre.|$|E
5|$|Thored {{may be the}} Thored {{who appears}} {{for the first time}} in charter {{attestations}} during the reign of King <b>Edgar</b> (95975), his earliest possible appearance being in 964, witnessing a grant of land in Kent by King <b>Edgar</b> to St Peter's, Ghent. This is uncertain because the authenticity of this particular charter is unclear. A charter issued by <b>Edgar</b> in 966, granting land in Oxfordshire to a woman named Ælfgifu, has an illegible ealdorman witness signature beginning with Þ, which may be Thored.|$|E

5|$|After {{consultation}} with Canadian Pacific Railway officials, Lieutenant Governor <b>Edgar</b> Dewdney {{made the decision}} to move the capital to Regina, also in present-day Saskatchewan, in June 1882. The decision to move the capital was controversial with the public because <b>Edgar</b> Dewdney owned real estate in Regina. He was accused of having conflicted interests between his private affairs and the needs of the government.|$|E
5|$|After {{entering}} {{service in}} early and mid-1911, respectively, <b>Edgar</b> Quinet and Waldeck-Rousseau {{were assigned to}} the Mediterranean Fleet. In 1913, <b>Edgar</b> Quinet participated in an international naval demonstration that also included British, German, and Austro-Hungarian vessels off Albania. The demonstration was a protest of the Siege of Scutari during the First Balkan War; it succeeded in forcing the Serbian army to withdraw and allowing an international force to occupy the city.|$|E

5|$|Griffin's father, <b>Edgar</b> Griffin (born 1921, Brighton, East Sussex) was {{previously}} a long-standing Conservative Party member and from 1959 to 1965 a councillor for the Metropolitan Borough of St Marylebone. He {{also served as}} a councillor on Waveney District Council during the 1980s. Griffin's mother, Jean (née Thomas), whom <b>Edgar</b> married in 1950, was an unsuccessful BNP candidate for Enfield North in the 1997 general election, in Chingford & Woodford Green for the 2001 general election and for London in the 1999 European elections.|$|E
50|$|He was {{recruited}} by William Edgars' anti-Sheridan right-hand-man {{known only as}} Wade, {{to work for the}} mega-corporation <b>Edgars</b> Industries. Garibaldi gained some initial trust in the organization by smuggling several valuable items destined for Mars through Babylon 5 customs. It was then that he learned that Lise had married William <b>Edgars.</b> Garibaldi demanded a face-to-face meeting on Mars with <b>Edgars</b> himself, wanting to know what he was involved in. When President Clark began attacking civilian targets, Sheridan declared his intent to remove Clark by any means necessary. <b>Edgars</b> agreed to bring Garibaldi into the inner circle if he arranged Sheridan's capture. Knowing Sheridan's weaknesses, Garibaldi provided medical details that allowed Sheridan's fugitive father to be captured. He then contacted Sheridan to offer help in rescuing his father, provided that he came to Mars alone. Still having some trust in Garibaldi, Sheridan fell into the trap. With Sheridan captured, <b>Edgars</b> informed him of the plot to release a virus contagious to human telepaths only. Psi-Corps agents moved in swiftly.|$|R

5|$|His {{relationship}} with King <b>Edgar</b> is unclear, particularly given {{the uncertainty of}} Thored's paternity, Oslac being banished from England in 975, the year of Edgar's death. Richard Fletcher, who thought Thored {{was the son of}} Gunnar, argued that Thored's raid on Westmorland was caused by resentment derived from losing out on the ealdormanry to Oslac, and that <b>Edgar</b> thereafter confiscated various territories as punishment. The evidence for this is that Newbald, granted by <b>Edgar</b> to Gunnar circa 963, was bought by Archbishop Osketel from the king sometime before 971, implying that the king had seized the land.|$|E
5|$|In 1899 Madge met {{her future}} husband <b>Edgar</b> Syers, a figure skater and coach who was 18 years her senior. <b>Edgar</b> was an {{exponent}} of the international skating style, which was freer and less rigid than the traditional English style, and encouraged Madge to adopt this style. Madge and <b>Edgar</b> completed together in pairs skating events, and in 1900 finished second {{in one of the}} first international pairs events, staged in Berlin. They married in June of that year. The Syers co-authored The Book of Winter Sports in 1908.|$|E
