25|$|By May, Jennings had early {{versions}} of the new software running. These early versions specified the routing manually through a new ROUTE.BBS file that listed network hosts for each node. For instance, an operator might want to forward all mail to St. Louis through a single node, node 10. ROUTE.BBS would then include {{a list of all}} the known systems in that area, with instructions to <b>forward</b> <b>mail</b> to each of those nodes through node 10.

50|$|A smart host {{is a type}} of {{email message}} {{transfer}} agent that allows a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server to route email to an intermediate mailserver rather than directly to the recipient's server. This smart host often requires authentication from the sender to verify that the sender has privileges to have mail forwarded through the smart host. This is an important distinction from an open mail relay that will <b>forward</b> <b>mail</b> from the sender without authentication. Common authentication techniques include SMTP Authentication and POP before SMTP.|$|E

This additional computer hardware/software combination looks up decoded addresses in the National Change of Address database to see if the recipient has recently moved.
