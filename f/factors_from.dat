The samples are Cita Rasa, Kueku Yovita and Arzel. To find the priority <b>factor</b> <b>from</b> each marketing mix used Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. This research showed that the priority <b>factor</b> <b>from</b> product mix is the hygiene product (0, 1222). The priority <b>factor</b> <b>from</b> price mix is the value for money (0, 2025). The priority <b>factor</b> <b>from</b> promotion mix is positioning the local product (0, 1539). The priority <b>factor</b> <b>from</b> place mix is market location position (0, 1841). The internal and external environment is used in SWOT analysis matriks. The Cita Rasa marketing development strategics are giving incentive price for consumers, market expansion, keep and maintain quality, taste and locallity product, and decorate the layout on the attractive display. The Kueku Yovita marketing development strategics are increase the promotion and advertising, giving incentive price for consumer, market expansion, and decorate the layout on the attractive display.

25|$|Although {{there is}} {{evidence}} for either perspective of the integration/differentiation dichotomy, a significant body of evidence also exists for a combination of <b>factors</b> <b>from</b> either view.

25|$|When the GR binds to glucocorticoids, {{its primary}} {{mechanism}} of action is the regulation of gene transcription. The unbound receptor resides in the cytosol of the cell. After the receptor is bound to glucocorticoid, the receptor-glucorticoid complex can take either of two paths. The activated GR complex up-regulates the expression of anti-inflammatory proteins in the nucleus or represses the expression of pro-inflammatory proteins in the cytosol (by preventing the translocation of other transcription <b>factors</b> <b>from</b> the cytosol into the nucleus).|$|E
25|$|Muscle {{weakness}} and atrophy are inevitable consequences of α-MN lesions as well. Because muscle {{size and strength}} {{are related to the}} extent of their use, denervated muscles are prone to atrophy. A secondary cause of muscle atrophy is that denervated muscles are no longer supplied with trophic <b>factors</b> <b>from</b> the α-MNs that innervate them. Alpha motor neuron lesions also result in abnormal EMG potentials (e.g., fibrillation potentials) and fasciculations, the latter being spontaneous, involuntary muscle contractions.|$|E

25|$|The {{covering}} {{factor of}} the torus might {{play an important}} role. Some torus models predict how Seyfert 1s and Seyfert 2s can obtain different covering <b>factors</b> <b>from</b> a luminosity- and accretion rate- dependence of the torus covering factor, something supported by studies in the x-ray of AGN. The models also suggest an accretion-rate dependence of the broad-line region and provide a natural evolution from more active engines in Seyfert 1s to more “dead” Seyfert 2s and can explain the observed break-down of the unified model at low luminosities {{and the evolution of}} the broad-line region.|$|E
25|$|Because they {{innervate}} many muscles, some {{clusters of}} α-MNs receive {{high concentrations of}} neurotrophic factors and survive this stage of neuronal pruning. This {{is true of the}} α-MNs innervating the upper and lower limbs: these α-MNs form large cell columns that contribute to the cervical and lumbar enlargements of the spinal cord. In addition to receiving neurotrophic <b>factors</b> <b>from</b> muscles, α-MNs also secrete a number of trophic factors to support the muscle fibers they innervate. Reduced levels of trophic factors contributes to the muscle atrophy that follows an α-MN lesion.|$|E
