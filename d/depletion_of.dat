40|$|Dependences <b>of</b> the <b>depletion</b> widths in a radial {{core-shell}} {{p-n diode}} on the radius of metallurgical {{boundary of the}} p-n junction have been studied theoretically in detail. While the <b>depletion</b> width <b>of</b> the core increases with decreasing the radius, the <b>depletion</b> width <b>of</b> the shell, on the contrary, decreases. This is the consequence of cylindrical symmetry of the structure. And the total <b>depletion</b> width <b>of</b> the p-n junction can both increase and decrease depending on doping levels of the core and shell.

5|$|A {{supernova}} is a cataclysmic {{explosion of}} a star. Within the Milky Way galaxy, supernova explosions occur on average once every 40 years. During {{the history of}} the Earth, multiple such events have likely occurred within a distance of 100 light years. Explosions inside this distance can contaminate the planet with radioisotopes and possibly impact the biosphere. Gamma rays emitted by a supernova react with nitrogen in the atmosphere, producing nitrous oxides. These molecules cause a <b>depletion</b> <b>of</b> the ozone layer that protects the surface from ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. An increase in UV-B radiation of only 10–30% is sufficient to cause a significant impact to life; particularly to the phytoplankton that form the base of the oceanic food chain. A supernova explosion at a distance of 26light years will reduce the ozone column density by half. On average, a supernova explosion occurs within 32light years once every few hundred million years, resulting in a <b>depletion</b> <b>of</b> the ozone layer lasting several centuries. Over the next two billion years, there will be about 20 supernova explosions and one gamma ray burst that will {{have a significant impact on}} the planet's biosphere.|$|E
5|$|Boron carbide's {{structure}} is only approximately B4C, {{and it shows}} a clear <b>depletion</b> <b>of</b> carbon from this suggested stoichiometric ratio. This is due to its very complex structure. The substance can be seen with empirical formula B12C3 (i.e., with B12 dodecahedra being a motif), but with less carbon, as the suggested C3 units are replaced with C-B-C chains, and some smaller (B6) octahedra are present as well (see the boron carbide article for structural analysis). The repeating polymer plus semi-crystalline structure of boron carbide gives it great structural strength per weight. It is used in tank armor, bulletproof vests, and numerous other structural applications.|$|E

40|$|The abundances of V, Cr, and Mn {{inferred}} for the mantles of {{the earth}} and moon decrease in that order and are similar in both mantles (but distinct from those in the mantles of the Eucrite Parent Body and Shergottite Parent Body), suggesting a common origin for the mantles {{of the earth}} and the moon.

It was found that the earth and the moon <b>depletions</b> <b>of</b> V, Cr, and Mn are not correlated with metal/silicate partition coefficients; the V and Cr partitioned into S-rich metallic liquids under reducing conditions more strongly than Mn, consistent with the relative volatilities of these elements.

5|$|Lactate uptake by {{the liver}} is diminished with {{metformin}} administration because lactate is a substrate for hepatic gluconeogenesis, {{a process that}} metformin inhibits. In healthy individuals, this slight excess is cleared by other mechanisms (including uptake by unimpaired kidneys), and no significant elevation in blood levels of lactate occurs. Given impaired kidney function, clearance of metformin and lactate is reduced, increasing levels of both, and possibly causing lactic acid buildup. Because metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate, any condition that may precipitate lactic acidosis is a contraindication. Common causes include alcoholism (due to <b>depletion</b> <b>of</b> NAD+ stores), heart failure and respiratory disease (due to inadequate tissue oxygenation); {{the most common cause}} is kidney disease.|$|E

40|$|Autosomal {{recessive}} primary microcephaly (MCPH) is a neurodevelopmental disorder {{characterized by}} marked reduction in brain size and mental retardation.
