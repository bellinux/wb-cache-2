In particular, the ability of the models to facilitate interactions between short-term responses to ATT and long-term changes in attitudes is very limited.

Finally, most existing models do not have an extendible structure to cope with new aspects of traveller-ATT interactions and provide flexibility to users.

40|$|Urban {{transport}} provisions, {{planning and}} development in Metropolitan Lagos is not gender sensitive. Rather, it is more masculine than being feminist. Women, {{in the metropolitan area}} out rightly deny access to decent, comfortable and reliable intra-urban movement services. Because the existing system is largely unregulated, inadequate, rowdy and characteristically unconventional. For instance, standardization in urban transport vehicles designs and operations are virtually not considered important by the authorities. As a result, women are manhandled, as well as being victims of pick-pockets, muggers while transiting in the metropolitan. And in the alternative, women do attempt long walking hours, as well as patronizing the ubiquitous, reckless and ill-mannered commercial motocyclists (Okada riders) at their own peril. Notwithstanding, they are being relatively denied access to the larger urban economic benefits. This problem, however, persists due to the poor planning procedures in urban transport operations in the metropolitan, as well as inexistent of versatile and dynamic urban transport policy.

40|$|Investments {{in urban}} {{transport}} should deliver the maximum economic, {{social and environmental}} benefits; in times of constrained budgets, projects' economic viability is often the deciding factor. This paper discusses the {{current practices and challenges}} facing cities in assessing urban transport interventions. On this basis, it develops options for decision-makers to appraise small-scale, sustainable urban transport policy measures. The analysis of current appraisal practice shows that data requirements and complexity are cities’ main obstacles appraising projects and comparing potential alternatives. Additionally, there is often a risk that project appraisal enters the planning process too late to play any meaningful role. Conducting a Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) ex-ante is often only approved if the implementation of the measure in question is already likely. Often, a CBA is a means to access funds rather than a basis for decision-making. Project appraisal of small-scale and non-infrastructure-based measures is often simply too expensive. On the basis of these findings, the paper discusses the following alternatives to comprehensive CBAs: 1) learn from others, 2) use a simplified assessment method, 3) rely on norms and values. All of these options aim to cope with the trade-off between effort and certitude. In practice, some policy-makers may already apply {{one or more of these}} options, but this has not been documented in a systematic manner. A systematic documentation of such practices could be a major step forward for implementation of sustainable and <b>integrated</b> <b>urban</b> <b>transport</b> projects, as it would shed some light on the reasoning behind decisions, from which conclusions could be drawn on the likely follow-on effects thereof and also possible improvements to the process...|$|E

Thus, suitable approaches are required to tackle current transport problems of Brazilian megacities. In view of the World Cup 2014 and the Olympic Games 2016, the megacity Rio de Janeiro is undergoing significant changes which offers a unique opportunity to ease the current situation and achieve an <b>integrated</b> sustainable <b>urban</b> <b>transport</b> concept. Therefore, this Diploma thesis creates an overview on the current transport situation in large Brazilian cities, in particular for Rio de Janeiro; provides integrated and sustainable approaches to tackle transport problems of Rio de Janeiro; analyzes the transferability of infrastructure measures between Curitiba and Rio de Janeiro; and examines the impact of the upcoming sports events. First, a literature review focuses on the transport situation in Brazil and Rio de Janei ro and explains Curitiba's unique approaches. Second, an audio-based qualitative content analysis of seven expert interviews with stakeholders in urban- and transportation planning gives a concise insight into the current transport situation. Third, a synthesis of both the literature review and the output of the expert interviews provide recommendations for decision makers, researchers and international organizations. In order to initiate a sustainable development of the megacity Rio de Janeiro, urban- and transportation planning must be interconnected with each other, a transport association has to be created to design and manage a metropolitan public transport network, and it is imperative to reorganize the local bus system. Furthermore, non-motorized transportation modes should be promoted by designing streets based on sidewalk policies and building a bicycle network in regard to the local demands. In addition, Curitiba's most important lesson for Rio de Janeiro is the interconnection of high density areas with mobility corridors. However, the megacity {{will not be able to}} achieve an <b>integrated</b> sustainable <b>urban</b> <b>transport</b> concept by the sports events. In conclusion, future transport measures have to focus on the middle class, while ensuring a needs-oriented mobility for all social classes. Decision makers should concentrate on the three "I's" – Information, Integration and Inclusion – to enable real transport mode choices, facilitate sound and seamless travel, and attract more people towards ecomobile transportation modes.

40|$|In {{recent decades}} {{there has been}} growing {{recognition}} of the adverse effects that dispersed urban form has {{on the environment and}} wellbeing of urban residents. In response to growing urban populations and a global call for urban sustainability, spatial planning has shifted away from the case by case method of regulating urban development which facilitated sprawl, toward a long term strategic approach to planning future land use. Under this approach, a more sustainable vision of a city’s future layout is developed by local councils and implemented through a strategic spatial plan. However if strategic planning is to increase urban sustainability, it must address the most significant issue of sprawling cities; vehicle dependant <b>urban</b> <b>transport</b> systems, which result in high CO 2 emissions among other impacts. <b>Integrating</b> <b>transport</b> and <b>urban</b> form elements is argued to be a key approach to address these issues. Planning urban form to increase density, destination accessibility, and diversity, reduce distance to public transport, and design (coined as the 5 Ds of sustainable urban form by R Ewing, Bartholomew, Winkelman, Walters, and Chen (2007) all function to reduce travel demand and induce a shift to alternative modes of transport. This reduces vehicle kilometres travelled by people in urban areas and its associated impacts. If strategic spatial planning aims to increase urban sustainability then, it needs to <b>integrate</b> <b>transport</b> and <b>urban</b> form through incorporating and considering these five urban form elements. In 2014, Porirua City Council, carried out a strategic spatial planning exercise to envision a future housing development scenario in its northern periphery over the next 30 years.

While opportunities to support more sustainable transport modes were identified early on in the process, the planning process did not integrate transport into decisions about urban form in a way that maximised these. This was due to a range of factors including: the lack of transport related objectives; perceptions of increased density; funding issues; and resource capacity issues within the local council...|$|R
