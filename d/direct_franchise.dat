40|$|Market entry {{strategies}} of international franchising firms have been extensively researched. However, {{most of the}} studies focus on the cases of developed countries rather than developing countries. Since China adopted the open policy in 1978, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has grown rapidly and played an increasingly important role in contributing to the 9 percent of economic growth {{in the last two decades}} in China. Franchising, as an important entry method, has been adopted by many foreign investors to expand their business in China. Although the Chinese franchising market is still in its infancy, it creates tremendous opportunities for international franchisors. This thesis attempts to determine the factors associated with the international franchising firms' entry modes choices when these international franchisors enter the Chinese market and to find the relationships between these factors and decision of entry mode choice. To achieve these objectives, the positivist has been chosen as the philosophical stance for this research. Consisting with this research paradigm, a structured survey was undertaken as the main research method underlying quantitative research methodology. After a pilot study, 400 questionnaires were conducted by sampling international franchisors in China in the main research. Based on the five developed hypotheses, the determinants of franchising entry mode choice have been tested by using a logit model. The findings of this research reveal five important factors which dramatically influence international franchisors' entry mode choices in the Chinese markets. They are: culture and geographic distance, market operation experience, risk spreading, franchising system development stage and mature of the franchising system. Firstly, this study indicates that the less the cultural and geographic distance between the host and home country, the more likely the international franchising firms is to adopt <b>direct</b> <b>franchising</b> entry mode into Chinese market. Secondly, the richer experience the international franchisor, the more likely the firms is to adopt <b>direct</b> <b>franchising</b> entry mode into China. Thirdly, the higher the rate of the expansion of the franchising system, the more likely the firms is to adopt <b>direct</b> <b>franchising</b> entry mode in China. Fourthly, the more mature the international franchising system, the more likely the firms is to adopt <b>direct</b> <b>franchising</b> entry mode in China. Finally, the more consideration of risk spreading, the more likely the firms is to adopt <b>direct</b> <b>franchising</b> entry mode in China. This study offers a number of distinctive contributions from both academic and practical perspectives. Theoretically, this study has advanced the current literature of international franchising by examining cases in the emerging market of China and added more insights to the mainstream of franchising theories. Most importantly, it provides a guide to assist practitioners deciding their franchising entry modes effectively and offers valuable suggestions for policy makers in their foreign policy development regarding international franchisors' business operations in China. Significantly, this study provides timely information for academics and practitioners concerning the current status of international franchisors' business in the Chinese market...|$|R

40|$|Die vorliegende Masterarbeit hat die Auswirkungen der Prinzipal-Agent-Theorie, sowie der Transaktionskostentheorie auf die Wahl der Organisationsstruktur von internationalen Franchise-Unternehmen untersucht. Die empirische Untersuchung basiert auf den Daten von internationalen Franchise-Unternehmen, die ihren Hauptsitz in acht Ländern, i. e. in den USA und in Europa, haben. Die binäre logistische Regression wurde als Auswertungsinstrument gewählt. Es wurden die Effekte der Theorien auf die Wahl von direktem im Vergleich zu indirektem Franchising untersucht. Indirektes Franchising (i. e. Master Franchising) impliziert niedrige Kontrolle wobei direktes Franchising (i. e. Tochterunternehmen, Joint-Venture-Franchising, Einheits-Franchising und Mehreinheit-Franchising) hohe Kontrolle impliziert. Die empirischen Ergebnisse belegen nur die Hypothese in Bezug auf die Prinzipal-Agent-Theorie und liefern konträre Schlüsse für die Transaktionskostentheorie. Hohe Überwachungskosten auf Grund von Verhaltensunsicherheit erhöhen die Anwendung von indirektem Franchising. Die Hypothesen in Bezug auf die Transaktionskostentheorie konnten nicht belegt werden, weil die Ergebnisse konträr und zum Teil nicht signifikant waren. In this thesis, it was {{examined}} how Agency Theory and Transaction Cost Theory determine {{the choice of}} governance structure of international franchising firms. The empirical investigation was {{based on data from}} international franchising companies whose respective headquarters are located in eight countries, i. e. in the USA and in Europe. Binary logistic regression was used to obtain the empirical results. The different governance structure modes were summarized under <b>direct</b> <b>franchising</b> as opposed to indirect franchising. Indirect franchising (i. e. master franchising) is characterized by low control levels, whereas <b>direct</b> <b>franchising</b> (i. e. wholly-owned subsidiaries, joint-venture franchising, single-unit and multi-unit franchising) is characterized by higher control levels. The empirical results support only the hypothesis for Agency Theory and bring about contradictory findings for Transaction Cost Theory. In conclusion, high monitoring costs owing to behavioral uncertainty increase the use of indirect franchising. The hypotheses with regard to Transaction Cost Theory could not be supported as the results are contradictory and in part not significant. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{draws on}} UK data {{obtained}} from a useable sample of 673 'independent contractors' active {{in the field of}} <b>direct</b> sales <b>franchising.</b> This is a low-cost, low-entry barrier business opportunity, which, at any one time, facilitates 500, 000 individuals in the UK, mostly women, experiencing selfemployment without employees. Furthermore, whilst <b>direct</b> sales <b>franchises</b> claim to be the world's largest single provider of part-time, self-employment opportunities, most of the related trading is conducted in the informal economy and is not recorded in official self-employment statistics. The article presents a 2 x 2, product/service, home-based/external premises, franchise typology by way of background to the principal focus of the article, which is the direct sales segment of the typology. Additionally, this discussion is conducted {{against the backdrop of the}} UK's growth in the numbers of selfemployed without employees. In the case of direct selling, we are looking not only at micro-business activities devoid of employees, but also at a sector which operates largely on the basis of part-time economic activities and which manifests attrition rates of around 100 percent annually. Finally, a direct seller typology is presented involving three distinct types:'refugees', 'trade-offs' and 'opportunists'.
