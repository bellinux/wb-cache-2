5|$|Mimas is the {{smallest}} and least massive of the inner round moons, although its mass is sufficient to alter the orbit of Methone. It is noticeably ovoid-shaped, having been made shorter at the poles and longer at the equator (by about 20km) by the effects of Saturn's gravity. Mimas has a large impact crater one-third its diameter, Herschel, situated on <b>its</b> <b>leading</b> hemisphere. Mimas has no known past or present geologic activity, and its surface is dominated by impact craters. The only tectonic features known are a few arcuate and linear troughs, which probably formed when Mimas was shattered by the Herschel impact.|$|E

Norway is the Model S largest overseas market, with 11,763 new units registered through September 2016, followed by China with 5,524 units registered through September 2015. The Tesla Model S has been the world's top selling plug-in car {{for two years in}} a row, 2015 and 2016.

5|$|The Rhodesia Party {{remained}} in power until September 1933, when, despite narrowly topping the popular vote, it lost the month's election, winning only {{nine of the}} 30 seats compared to the Reform Party's 16. Although the Reform Party was left-wing in name, many of <b>its</b> <b>leading</b> members, including the new Prime Minister Dr Godfrey Huggins, were politically conservative; the more rightist members of the party merged with the Rhodesia Party in 1934 to form the United Party, and, with Huggins at the helm, roundly defeated the rump left wing of the Reform Party to begin 28 years of uninterrupted stewardship.|$|E

5|$|After the 4–0 series {{win over}} England, which was Bradman's {{farewell}} series, Morris became Australia's vice-captain and {{was expected to}} be <b>its</b> <b>leading</b> batsman. He started well, scoring two centuries during Australia's first series in the post-Bradman era, a tour to South Africa that saw Australia win the Test series 4–0. By the end of the South African tour, Morris had amassed nine Test centuries and his batting average was over 65, but thereafter his form declined. Australia increasingly fell on hard times as the core of Bradman's team aged and retired. Morris was overlooked for the captaincy and then briefly dropped as his cricketing prowess waned. His career ended after his first wife became terminally ill. Later in his life, Morris served as a trustee of the Sydney Cricket Ground for over twenty years.|$|E

5|$|For the season, {{he played}} in all 34 Bundesliga matches, {{starting}} 29, and recorded 13 goals and 11 assists. Bayern and Müller were back in Berlin the following week, to face Werder Bremen in {{the final of the}} DFB-Pokal. Müller started the match and Bayern won 4–0 to complete the domestic double. Müller scored four goals and made two assists during the competition, which made him <b>its</b> <b>leading</b> scorer for the season. Bayern's season ended in pursuit of a first treble, in the 2010 Champions League Final against Inter Milano at Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid. It was not to be, however, as they lost 2–0, with both goals coming from Diego Milito. Müller was in the starting line-up and had a key chance just after half-time, with Bayern 1–0 down, but his shot was saved by Júlio César. Müller felt particularly disappointed by this defeat, but he ended his first season as a first-team player with 52 matches played and 19 goals in all competitions.|$|E
5|$|From 1970 through 1998, the Orange Bowl Committee, {{organizers}} of the Orange Bowl, recognized two most valuable players. Following the 63rd Orange Bowl, Virginia Tech running back Ken Oxendine and Nebraska running back Damon Benning were awarded the honor. Oxendine carried the ball 20 times during the game {{for a total of}} 150 rushing yards—an average of 7.5 yards per carry. He also caught three passes for 60 yards, making him the game's leading receiver as well as <b>its</b> <b>leading</b> rusher. Benning, meanwhile, carried the ball 15 times for 96 yards and two touchdowns. He also caught one pass for two yards and returned one kickoff 23 yards.|$|E

The remains of Quang Trung and his queen were exhumed and desecrated, and his son, the last Tây Sơn monarch Quang Toản was bound to four elephants and torn apart. Gia Long repealed the changes enacted by Quang Trung and reverted to the prior Confucian orthodoxy. This included restoring the civil service to the forefront of decision making, ahead of the army, and reversed Quang Trung's education reforms, which put science before the study of Confucian literature.|$|E

5|$|In seventh- and eighth-century England, most monasteries were Benedictine, but in {{the ninth}} century {{learning}} and monasticism declined severely. Alfred the Great (871–899) deplored the decline and started to reverse it. The court of Æthelstan (924–939), the first king of the whole of England, was cosmopolitan, and future reformers such as Dunstan and Æthelwold learned from Continental exponents of Benedictine monasticism. The English movement became dominant under King Edgar (959–975), who supported the expulsion of secular clergy from monasteries and cathedral chapters, and their replacement by monks. The reformers had close relations with the crown, furthering its interests and depending on its support. The movement was confined {{to the south and}} midlands, as the crown was not strong enough in the north to confiscate property from local elites to establish Benedictine foundations in the area. The movement declined after the deaths of <b>its</b> <b>leading</b> exponents {{at the end of the}} tenth century.|$|E
5|$|In the 1969 season, after a {{slow start}} and despite diminished speed and acceleration, Sayers {{led the league in}} rushing once again with 1,032 yards. He {{averaged}} 4.4 yards per carry and was the only player to gain over 1,000 rushing yards that year. He moved into second place on the Bears' all-time rushing yards list, passing Bronko Nagurski. Sayers was recognized as the NFL's Comeback Player of the Year by United Press International. The Bears, long past the Halas glory years, finished in last place with a franchise-worst 1–13 record. In his fourth and final Pro Bowl appearance, Sayers was the West's leading rusher and <b>its</b> <b>leading</b> receiver. For the third time in as many Pro Bowl performances, he was named the back of the game.|$|E
5|$|Minton {{was pleased}} with Roosevelt's bill and quickly became <b>its</b> <b>leading</b> {{supporter}} in the Senate. The measure was placed in an omnibus bill designed to reform judicial salaries and districting, among many other measures. Republicans quickly discovered the court-packing provision and targeted the bill. Democrats had overwhelming super-majorities in Congress, and passage of the bill at first seemed assured. Minton's support of the bill helped him earn the position of Senate majority whip, allowing him to more effectively push for its passage. Minton delivered six radio addresses {{on behalf of his}} party in support of the bill, but public opinion could not be swayed in the Democrats' favor.|$|E

5|$|On 27 June 1978, {{three months}} after the revolution, Amin managed to outmaneuver the Parchamites at a Central Committee meeting. The meeting decided that the Khalqists had {{exclusive}} rights to formulate and decide policy, a policy which left the Parchamites impotent. Karmal was exiled, but was able to establish a network with the remaining Parchamites in government. A coup to overthrow Amin was planned for September. <b>Its</b> <b>leading</b> members in Afghanistan were Qadir, the defence minister, and Army Chief of Staff General Shahpur Ahmedzai. The coup was planned for 4 September, on the Festival of Eid, because soldiers and officers would be off duty. The conspiracy failed when the Afghan ambassador to India told the Afghan leadership about the plan. A purge was initiated, and Parchamite ambassadors were recalled; few returned, for example Karmal and Mohammad Najibullah both stayed in their assigned countries.|$|E
5|$|Tethys is {{the third}} largest of Saturn's inner moons. Its most {{prominent}} features are a large (400km diameter) impact crater named Odysseus on <b>its</b> <b>leading</b> hemisphere and a vast canyon system named Ithaca Chasma extending at least 270° around Tethys. The Ithaca Chasma is concentric with Odysseus, and these two features may be related. Tethys appears to have no current geological activity. A heavily cratered hilly terrain occupies {{the majority of its}} surface, while a smaller and smoother plains region lies on the hemisphere opposite to that of Odysseus. The plains contain fewer craters and are apparently younger. A sharp boundary separates them from the cratered terrain. There is also a system of extensional troughs radiating away from Odysseus. The density of Tethys (0.985g/cm3) is less than that of water, indicating that it is made mainly of water ice with {{only a small fraction of}} rock.|$|E
5|$|The Hananu Revolt (also {{known as}} the Aleppo Revolt or the Northern revolts) {{occurred}} in 1920–1921 in the western countryside of Aleppo and its purpose was to drive out French military forces from northern Syria.

The revolt was named after <b>its</b> <b>leading</b> commander, Ibrahim Hananu, and mainly consisted of four allied revolts in the areas of Jabal Harim, Jabal Qusayr, Jabal Zawiya and Jabal Sahyun. The rebels were led by rural leaders and mostly engaged in guerrilla attacks against French forces or the sabotage of key infrastructure.|$|E
