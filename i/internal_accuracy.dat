40|$|The Gaia {{satellite}} will {{survey the}} entire celestial sphere down to 20 th magnitude, obtaining astrometry, photometry, and low resolution spectrophotometry on one billion astronomical sources, plus radial velocities for {{over one hundred}} million stars. Its main objective {{is to take a}} census of the stellar content of our Galaxy, with the goal of revealing its formation and evolution. Gaia’s unique feature is the measurement of parallaxes and proper motions with hitherto unparalleled accuracy for many objects. As a survey, the physical properties of most of these objects are unknown. Here we describe the data analysis system put together by the Gaia consortium to classify these objects and to infer their astrophysical properties using the satellite’s data. This system covers single stars, (unresolved) binary stars, quasars, and galaxies, all covering a wide parameter space. Multiple methods are used for many types of stars, producing multiple results for the end user according to different models and assumptions.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an assessment of}} the geometric quality of four CBERS- 2 B HRC images. Accurate coordinates of ground control points were used for this purpose in three of the four images, which comprehends two different sites in Brazilian northwest region. Another image is from Brasília and had its geometric accuracy evaluated using coordinates obtained from a 1 : 25, 000 scale map. The evaluation was performed using a tool developed by the National Institute for Space Research (INPE) to allow visualization and quality evaluation of satellite images. This tool is called Marlin and will be distributed by INPE to the CBERS images users. The orthogonal transformation was used in verifying the image internal geometric quality and an affine transformation used to verifying the registration possibilities. The <b>internal</b> <b>accuracy</b> verified was around 200 m for the three images of the northwest region and 150 m for the Brasília image. If an affine transformation is used to refine the geometric correction process, <b>internal</b> <b>accuracy</b> improves to less than 20 m for the four images. The poor internal geometric quality verified by this assessment seems to be caused by a systematic behavior. The points standing in the images borders have higher residuals than those standing in the center. These results show that, although the nominal spatial resolution of the images is of 2. 5 m, the positional accuracy obtained after the application of an affine transformation is around 20 m, thus indicating that the images are applicable to a cartographic use in scales lower than 1 : 50. 000.

Milliarcsecond (mas) accurate radio positions of 106 sources north of - 2 deg declination {{are derived from}} Mark III Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations taken during ten experiments from 1990 January through 1990 October. The results presented supplement an ongoing project to define and maintain an all-sky radio/optical reference frame of 400 or more extragalactic sources with mas accurate radio and optical positions. Radio positions for 34 new sources are presented along with improved radio positions for 72 sources already in the reference frame catalog. An additional nine sources have been determined to be unsuitable reference frame objects. Radio observations of nine calibration sources tie the new positions to the existing catalogue. The radio positions of the new sources have formal mean errors of approximately 0. 7 mas in right ascension and approximately 1. 0 mas in declination. Sources for which we report improved radio positions now have formal mean errors of approximately 0. 5 mas in both coordinates, an improvement in some cases {{by as much as}} 75 %.

40|$|Using new {{narrowband}} color {{observations of}} early-type galaxies in clusters, we reconstruct the color-magnitude relation (CMR) {{with a higher}} degree of accuracy than previous work. We then use the spectroscopically determined ages and metallicities from three samples (Trager et al 2008, Thomas et al 2005, Gallazzi et al 2006), combined with multi-metallicity SED models, to compare predicted colors for galaxies with young ages (less than 8 Gyr) with the known CMR. We find that the CMR cannot by reproduced by the spectroscopically determined ages and metallicities in any of the samples despite the high <b>internal</b> <b>accuracies</b> to the spectroscopic indices. In contrast, using only the index to determine [Fe/H], and assuming a mean age of 12 Gyr for a galaxy's stellar population, we derive colors that exactly match not only the color zeropoint of the CMR but also its slope. We consider the source of young age estimates, the Hβ index, and examine the conflict between red continuum colors and large Hβ values in galaxy spectra. We conclude that our current understanding of stellar populations is insufficient to correctly interpret Hβ values and that the sum of our galaxy observations supports an old and monolithic scenario of galaxy formation. This result has a devastating impact on every study that has used the Hβ index to calculate galaxy age, as the use of the Hβ versus MgFe diagram will result in incorrectly deduced young ages.

40|$|A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) {{typically}} {{represents the}} height of the Earth's surface or terrain and is usually derived from photogrammetry, field survey and airborne technologies. There are a variety of applications that DEMs are ideally suited for, ranging from topographic mapping, 3 D terrain visualisation and orthorectification of photographs to solving real world problems such as viewshed analysis and flood modelling. The main aim of the research project was to undertake an assessment of Maltese DEMs and critically evaluate the factors that affect their accuracies and a number of subsequent objectives were created from this. One of the main areas of focus was to compare the height values of DEMs against highly accurate cm level survey data collected using Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) GPS. In addition, the impact of terrain slope, land cover, DEM resolution and interpolation algorithm were investigated to see if these factors had an impact on accuracy. The research was undertaken in Mellieha in the Northern part ofthe Island of Malta and suitable study zones were defined for data collection. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) were used to spatially model and analyse the terrain whilst Microsoft Excel and Access were used to manipulate and process the attribute data. A form of relative analysis was undertaken to assess the <b>internal</b> <b>accuracies</b> ofthe DEMs. The main finding was that the currency of the DEMs caused accuracies to decrease because in many areas the terrain had changed significantly. The interpolation methods produced some variable results due to the irregular distribution of points used in the generation of the DEMs. In addition, the research found that there was no single factor that completely influenced the accuracy of DEMs. There was a slight correlation between DEM resolution and slope in relation to accuracy although this was not particularly significant and there was some evidence that land cover had some influence...|$|R
