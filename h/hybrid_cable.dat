40|$|Abstract In {{the study}} of dynamic {{subsurface}} processes {{there is a need}} to monitor temperature and groundwater fluxes efficiently in both time and space. Distributed Temperature Sensing has recently become more accessible to researchers in Earth Sciences, and allows temperatures to be measured simultaneously, at small intervals, and over large distances along fibre optic cables. The capability of DTS in conjunction with heat injection to detect groundwater fluxes, is assessed in this thesis using a combination of numerical modelling, laboratory tests, and field trials at the Ploemeur research site in Brittany, France. In particular, three methodological approaches are developed: thermal dilution tests, point heating, and the <b>hybrid</b> <b>cable</b> method. A numerical model was developed to assess the sensitivity range of thermal dilution tests to groundwater flow. Thermal dilution tests undertaken at Ploemeur showed lithological contrasts, and allowed the apparent thermal conductivity to be estimated in-situ, but failed to detect previously identified transmissive fractures. The use of DTS to monitor in-well vertical flow is then investigated. This is first using a simple experiment deploying point heating (T-POT), which tracks a parcel of heated water vertically through the borehole. The method allowed for the relatively quick estimation of velocities in the well. The use of heated fibre optics is then trialled, and through a field test was shown to be sensitive to in-well vertical flow. However, the data suffered from a number of artefacts related to the cable installation. To address this, a <b>hybrid</b> <b>cable</b> system was deployed in a flume to determine the sensitivity relationship with flow angle and electrical power input. Additionally, a numerical model was developed, which suggested a lower limit for velocity estimation due to thermal buoyancy. With the emergence of Distributed Acoustic Sensing, fibre optics may become an increasingly practicable and complete solution for monitoring subsurface processes...|$|E
40|$|Stay cables on {{cable-stayed}} bridges {{are vulnerable}} to dynamic excitations due to their long flexible feature and low intrinsic damping. Connecting a vulnerable cable with the neighbouring ones through cross-ties to form a cable network {{is one of the}} commonly used field solutions. The current dissertation is dedicated to explore the in-plane dynamic behaviour of the conventional (cross-tie only) and hybrid (combined use of cross-ties and external dampers) cable networks used for controlling undesirable bridge stay cable vibrations. Their performances are evaluated based on the system in-plane stiffness, damping and the severity of local mode formation. A number of analytical models have been developed to analyze the in-plane modal response of conventional cable networks by gradually extending the model of a basic undamped two-cable network with a rigid cross-tie to include the cross-tie stiffness, the damping property of main cables and cross-tie, and more number of main cables and cross-tie lines into the formulation. A damping transfer phenomenon between cable network elements having different damping properties was observed. Two criteria, the degree of mode localization (DML) coefficient and the local mode cluster (LMC), were proposed to quantify the severity of local mode formation. Based on the proposed analytical models, key system parameters which dictate the dynamic behaviour of conventional cable networks were identified. A parametric study was conducted to explore their respective role in influencing the in-plane stiffness, the damping ratio and the local mode formation of cable networks. Analytical models of two-cable hybrid networks with different configurations have been developed to assess the system in-plane modal behaviour. A concept of “isoquant curve” was proposed to optimize the performance of a selected hybrid system mode. A state-of-the-art generalized approach was developed to derive analytical models of a more complex conventional or <b>hybrid</b> <b>cable</b> network from a relatively simple parent system. Results indicated that the existing universal damping estimation curve for a single isolated damped cable was no longer applicable once the cable became part of a hybrid system. Thus, approximate relation equations were developed to predict the optimum damper size and the maximum attainable fundamental modal damping ratio of a basic two-cable hybrid system. All the proposed analytical models were validated through independent numerical simulations using the commercial finite element software Abaqus 6. 10. Besides, an experimental study was conducted for two-cable conventional and hybrid networks to not only verify the validity of the corresponding analytical and numerical models, but also evaluate the impact of different assumptions made in the formulation of these models on the system modal response. The outcomes yielded from this study are expected to add valuable knowledge to comprehend the current understanding of the mechanics associated with the conventional and <b>hybrid</b> <b>cable</b> networks. The developed tools will greatly contribute to the bridge industry by assisting optimum design of conventional and <b>hybrid</b> <b>cable</b> networks, especially in the preliminary design stage. Besides, it is worthy pointing out that the current findings will also contribute to the knowledge of structural health monitoring, assessment and management of bridges, and the development of more sustainable civil infrastructures...|$|E

40|$|KICT (Korea Institute of Construction Technology) is {{conducting}} a project called “SUPER BRIDGE 200 —Development of Low Cost and Long Life <b>Hybrid</b> <b>Cable</b> Stayed Bridge”. This project aims to reduce the construction and main- tenance costs of long-span bridges by 20 % and double their lifetime through the exploitation of ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC). This paper presents the design and construction of the first pedestrian cable stayed bridge using UHPC developed by KICT. UHPC, compared to conventional concrete, has not only high compressive and tensile strengths but also high ductility. The UHPC developed at KICT is a steel fiber-reinforced cement compound presenting design compressive strength larger than 180 MPa and design tensile strength exceeding 10 MPa with water-to-binder ratio below 0. 24 and admixing of 2 volume percentage of steel fiber. To show the applicability of UHPC to structures, a pedestrian cable stayed bridge (Super Bridge I) exploiting {{the characteristics of the}} developed UHPC has been planned, designed and erected at KICT. The dimension of UHPC deck is 2. 7 m × 7 m as a precast segment with a typical thickness of deck of only 7 cm.

40|$|Action {{potential}} of a cardiac cell membrane and its conduction in the cardiac tissue provide a basis of the electrophysiological function of the heart through the cardiac excitation-contraction coupling mechanism. Towards a better and a quantitative understanding of electrophysiological mechanisms of the reentrant cardiac arrhythmias at cellular, tissue, and organ levels, mathematical models of cardiac cells, tissues, and the heart have been developed and analyzed by simulating conduction of action potentials {{in a variety of}} conditions. However it is inevitable for those models to become large scale in the number of dynamical variables, requiring immense amount of computational time for their dynamic simulations. In this study, an analog-digital hybrid circuit model of electrical excitation of a cardiac cell based on Luo-Rudy phase I (LR-I) model, a typical mathematical model of a cardiac cell was developed. Through its hardware implementation, real-time simulations of the cellular excitations as well as their propagation in a cardiac tissue model have been performed with the hybrid circuit model. This thesis is organized as follows. It is started with a general introduction in Chapter 1. The research background is discussed in Chapter 2, where physiology of the heart and the mechanism of electrical system which controls the cardiac contraction are elaborated. These are then followed by explaining the basis of knowledge on electrical potentials that exist across cell membranes and describing how they are modeled. Computational techniques of mathematical modeling and hardware-implemented circuits that have been developed over past few decades in understanding the dynamics of cells and excitationconduction are also reviewed especially in cardiac cell modeling. Chapter 3 is focusing on the work presented in a single cell model, where a design method of the analog-digital hybrid circuit cell is overviewed, followed by details of the analog-digital hybrid active circuit. The design method of current-voltage (I-V) relationships between ion currents and the membrane potential reproduced by analog and digital circuits is also explained. Furthermore, action {{potential of}} the hybrid circuit model is initiated by an external stimulus and the result is compared to the result of the LR-I model. Action potential generation of the hybrid circuit model in response to periodic current impulse trains with different interval (period) T are carried out and comparisons to the result from the LR-I model are presented. Classification of excitation response patterns on the parameter plane spanned by the period T and the intensity A of the impulse trains 1 in the hybrid model and LR-I model are analyzed, and the results between the two models are also compared. According to the simulations results, the action potential characteristics of the hybrid cell model and the LR-I cell model are comparable as the hybrid cell model generally well reproduces the I-V relationships of ion currents described in the LR-I model, as well as the action potential waveform, and the excitation dynamics in response to periodic current impulse trains with various intervals and intensity levels. In Chapter 4, the work on investigating the spatio-temporal dynamics and control of reentrant action potential conduction in active cable models is being reviewed. Manner and underlying mechanisms in the initiation of the reentrant action potential conduction in a one dimensional ring-topology-network of the hybrid active circuit cable model are constructed as a model of anatomical reentrant tachycardia. Dynamics of the hybrid active circuit cable model are then compared with those in the numerical simulation of the LR-I cable model. Resetting and annihilation of the reentrant wave under the influence of single and sequence of stimulations are investigated by using the <b>hybrid</b> <b>cable</b> model and comparisons to the result from the LR-I cable model are carried out. Resetting and annihilation of the reentrant wave are of crucial importance in clinical situations where the reentrant cardiac arrhythmias are often controlled and terminated by delivering electrical stimulations to the heart through catheters. Phase resetting curves (PRCs) of both models are presented to show the relationship between the phase reset of the reentry and the phase of single stimulation. According to the PRCs, sequential phase resetting by periodic stimulation that leads to annihilations of the reentry are predicted and illustrated with onedimensional discrete Poincare mappings. As the results in the simulations of the reentrant action potential conduction, quantitative correspondence between the <b>hybrid</b> <b>cable</b> model and the LR-I cable model was demonstrated using a one dimensional active cable as a model of the anatomical reentry in a cardiac tissue with various conditions. Those include (1) unidirectional block to initiate reentry, (2) phase resetting by single impulsive stimulations, (3) annihilations of the reentry by appropriately timed single stimulations, (4) phase resetting curves (PRCs) that can characterize the reentry dynamics in response to single stimulations at various timings, and (5) sequential phase resetting that leads to annihilation of the reentry as predicted by the one dimensional discrete Poincare mappings. Finally, general discussion and conclusions are being reviewed in Chapter 5. The overall results of the hybrid circuit model are satisfied with those of the LR-I model, corresponding to the subjects examined in the study. Therefore, by taking into account the satisfactory results and the real-time simulation capability of the hybrid model, these can be concluded that the hybrid model might be a useful tool for large scale simulations of cardiac tissue dynamics, as an alternative to numerical simulations, toward further understanding of the reentrant mechanisms. As a matter of fact, minimizing power consumption and physical size of the circuits need to put into consideration regarding to large-scale development of the hybrid model...|$|E

40|$|Prestressed {{suspension}} bridge {{is a type}} of structures which allows covering long spans due to rational use of structural materials. Prestressing of {{suspension bridge}} allows to minimize cinematic displacements and makes possible not to use cantlage. The stress distribution by the length of the main load carrying cable of suspension bridge is non-uniform. Equalization of stresses by the length of the cable open possibility to increase degree of material usage. The effects of stress equalization by the length of the cable can be achieved with the using of cable with variable by it length cross-section. The prestressed suspension bridge with main span equal to 200 m was considered as an object of investigation (Fig. 1). <b>Hybrid</b> composite <b>cable</b> on the base of steel and CFRP with variable by it length cross-section of steel component is considered as a main load-carrying structure of the prestressed suspension bridge. Using of CFRP component allows increasing specific strength of the cable and decrease total dead weight of load-carrying structure. The <b>hybrid</b> composite <b>cable</b> was divided into the section with the length equal to the distances between the suspensions. The considered prestressed suspension bridge was investigated by the FEM software ANSYS 12. Rational cross-section of steel components of <b>hybrid</b> composite <b>cable</b> was determined for each section. Influence of the effect of stress equalization by the length of the cable on the materials consumption and displacements of prestressed suspension bridge was investigated...|$|R
