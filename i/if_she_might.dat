Noriko is friendly with her father’s assistant, Hattori (Jun Usami), and Aunt Masa suggests that her brother ask Noriko <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> be interested in Hattori. When he does bring up the subject, however, Noriko laughs: Hattori has been engaged to another young woman for quite some time.|$|E
25|$|The title {{character}} of Babette was initially offered to Catherine Deneuve. Deneuve {{was interested in}} the part but was concerned because she had been criticized in her past attempts to depart from her usual sophisticated woman roles. While Deneuve deliberated for a day, Axel met with French actress Stéphane Audran. Axel remembered Audran from her roles in Claude Chabrol's films Violette Nozière (1978) and Poulet au vinaigre (1985). When Axel asked Chabrol (her former husband) about Audran's suitability, Chabol said Audran was the archetype of Babette. Axel gave the script to Audran, told her that Deneuve was contemplating the role, and asked her <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> be able to respond before the next day. Audran called two hours later and said she wanted the role. The following day, Deneuve declined and Audran was officially cast.|$|E
500|$|.....Bane {{managed to}} capture {{much of the}} ex-mayor's character: Her eyes are {{friendly}} and her hair as wild as ever. But Katz's signature grin is a little stiff, a little too aggressive. Leaning forward, she looks as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> take {{a bite out of}} the next passerby. Which by the way, seems appropriate when you look back on her days behind the mayoral desk. Maybe monochromatic bronze just isn't the right medium for a woman as colorful as ol' Vera. Where's the red blazer? Our suggestion: Get this lady some accessories! The right hat or scarf could make that brown pantsuit really work.|$|E

500|$|Patrick van der Eem, working {{undercover}} for De Vries, had befriended Van der Sloot, who {{was unaware}} {{that he was}} being taped when he said that Holloway had suffered some kind of seizure while having sex on the beach. After failing to revive her, Van der Sloot said that he summoned a friend named Daury. The two men neither phoned for medical help nor checked Natalee to determine <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> still be alive. [...] Then, according to Van der Sloot, Daury volunteered to load her on a boat, and he dumped Natalee's body into the sea. The prosecutor in Aruba determined the video was admissible, but the evidence was deemed [...] "insufficient" [...] to warrant Van der Sloot's, or anyone's, arrest. Although the taped confession appeared damning, Van der Sloot argued that he was lying to impress Van der Eem, who he believed was a drug dealer.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{nominated}} for a Golden Globe award for Best Original Song, but lost to U2's [...] "The Hands That Built America" [...] from Gangs of New York. At the 46th Grammy Awards, it was nominated in the categories of Best Dance Recording and Best Short Form Music Video, but lost both awards; the former to Kylie Minogue's [...] "Come into My World" [...] and the latter to Johnny Cash's [...] "Hurt". [...] "Die Another Day" [...] was also nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Original Song of 2002 while Madonna herself won the trophy of Worst Supporting Actress for her cameo in the film. In a MORI poll for the Channel 4 TV show James Bond's Greatest Hits, the song was voted the ninth best out of 22, but also came in as an [...] "overwhelming number one" [...] favorite among those under the age of 24. Rock music critic Neil McCormick from The Daily Telegraph named it the fifth best James Bond theme song, describing [...] "Die Another Day" [...] as an electro R workout which was [...] "expressively weird, brutally modern, satisfyingly original and evocative of the dark heart of Bond. Plus, Madonna actually looks as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> be a match for Bond in either bed or battlefield. Or both." [...] Rolling Stone listed it as the seventh best Bond song in the magazine's list of [...] "The top 10 James Bond Theme Songs".|$|E
500|$|Changeling {{begins with}} an abduction, but largely avoids framing the story as a family drama to {{concentrate}} on {{a portrait of a}} woman whose desire for independence is seen as a threat to male-dominated society. The film depicts 1920s Los Angeles as a city in which the judgment of men takes precedence; women are labeled [...] "hysterical and unreliable" [...] if they dare to question it. Film critic Prairie Miller said that in its portrayal of female courage the film was [...] "about as feminist as Hollywood can get", and that because of this it had been the subject of sexist disdain. She compared this with the sexism shown to the women in Changeling and those who vied for high political office in 2008. Miller surmised that attitudes to independent, career-minded women had not changed significantly in the intervening years: Collins defies male-generated cultural expectations that women are not suited for professional careers and are punished for it. Rather than [...] "an expression of feminist awareness", David Denby argues, the film—like Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby—is [...] "a case of awed respect for a woman who was strong and enduring". The portrait of a vulnerable woman whose mental state is manipulated by the authorities was likened to the treatment of Ingrid Bergman's character in Gaslight(1944), who also wondered <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> be insane; Eastwood cited photographs that show Collins smiling with the child she knows is not hers. Like many other women of the period who were deemed disruptive, Collins is forced into the secret custody of a mental institution. The film shows that psychiatry became a tool in the gender politics of the era, only a few years after women's suffrage in the United States was guaranteed by the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment. As women ceased to be second-class citizens and began to assert their independence, the male establishment used mental institutions in an effort to disempower them; in common with other unmanageable women, Collins is subjected to medical treatment designed to break her spirit and compel obedience, though some of the treatments, specifically the electroconvulsive therapy depicted in the film, did not exist ca. 1928-1930. The film quotes the testimony of the psychiatrist who treated Collins. Eastwood said the testimony evidenced how women were prejudged, and that the behavior of the police reflected how women were seen at the time. He quoted the words of the officer who sent Collins to the mental facility: Something is wrong with you. You're an independent woman. Clint Eastwood said, [...] "The period could not accept [...] ".|$|E

2500|$|Harris {{currently}} teaches and directs. Asked <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> {{one day be}} lured back {{to mainstream}} stage, film or television, Harris said in the 2002 interview: Well, if someone handed me something fantastic for 10 million dollars, I'd work again. But I haven't worked {{in a long time}} as an actor. I don't miss it. I think the only thing that drew me to acting in the first place was the group of people I was working with: Ed Asner, Paul Sills, Mike Nichols, Elaine May. And all I really wanted to do back then was rehearsal. I was in it for the process, and I really resented having {{to go out and do}} a performance for an audience, because the process stopped; it had to freeze and be the same every night. It wasn't as interesting." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Thomas Merton, Saint Lutgarde (d.1246), a Cistercian mystic of Aywieres, Belgium, {{was one of}} {{the great}} {{precursors}} of the devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. A contemporary of St. Francis, she [...] "... entered upon the mystical life with a vision of the pierced Heart of the Saviour, and had concluded her mystical espousals with the Incarnate Word by an exchange of hearts with Him." [...] Sources say that Christ came in a visitation to Lutgarde, offering her whatever gift of grace she should desire; she asked for a better grasp of Latin, that she might better understand the word of God and sing God's praise. Christ granted her request and Lutgarde’s mind was flooded with the riches of psalms, antiphons, readings, and responsories. However, a painful emptiness persisted. She returned to Christ, asking to return his gift, and wondering <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>might,</b> just possibly, exchange it for another. “And for what would you exchange it?” Christ asked. “Lord, said Lutgarde, I would exchange it for your Heart.” Christ then reached into Lutgarde and, removing her heart, replaced it with his own, at the same time hiding her heart within his breast.|$|E
2500|$|... "Beauty and the Beast" [...] {{was written}} by lyricist Howard Ashman and {{composer}} Alan Menken in 1990. Intending for the song to be [...] "the height of simplicity", the songwriters drew much of its influence from Broadway music. Due to Ashman's failing health, some of Beauty and the Beasts pre-production was relocated to a hotel in Fishkill, New York near Ashman's residence to accommodate the ailing lyricist. Out of all the songs he has written for Beauty and the Beast, Menken devoted the most time to the title song. The track was first recorded by British-American actress Angela Lansbury, who voices the character Mrs. Potts, an enchanted teapot. The songwriters first introduced [...] "Beauty and the Beast" [...] to Lansbury as a demo recording, which {{was accompanied by a}} note asking her <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> possibly be interested in singing it. Although a seasoned film and stage performer who had previously done her own singing for Disney in the musical film Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971), Lansbury, who was more accustomed to performing uptempo songs, was hesitant to record the ballad because of its unfamiliar rock style. Although she liked the song, Lansbury also worried that her aging singing voice was no longer strong enough to record [...] "Beauty and the Beast", and was especially concerned about having to sustain its longer notes. Lansbury suggested that the songwriters ask someone else to sing [...] "Beauty and the Beast", but they insisted that she simply [...] "sing the song the way [...] envisioned it." ...|$|E
