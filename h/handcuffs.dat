5|$|Kate is {{revealed}} to be the marshal's prisoner, wearing the <b>handcuffs</b> that Walt found in the jungle. As the turbulence hits, the marshal is knocked unconscious by a falling suitcase. Kate struggles to put on her oxygen mask due to the <b>handcuffs,</b> so she uncuffs herself using the marshal's keys and puts the marshal's oxygen mask on him before attaching her own, {{at which point the}} tail end of the plane suddenly breaks off and flies away.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{structure}} of raditional <b>handcuff</b> is of lower reliability. Also, {{it is difficult}} to realise the easy-keeping of <b>handcuff</b> keys for different <b>handcuff</b> with different key. In this paper, a new safe <b>handcuff</b> ring is innovative designed adoping transplanation method. The {{structure of}} the said new ring is the combination of gear rack with ratchet and magnetic snap. The modeling and analyse of the new <b>handcuff</b> ring is also studied. The new designed safe ring has many distictive advantages that the traditional one do not have, including convinient, reliability, simplicity and beauty...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHandcuffed {{designs are}} a {{particular}} case of block designs on graphs. A <b>handcuffed</b> design with parameters v, k, λ consists {{of a system of}} ordered k-subsets of a v-set, called <b>handcuffed</b> blocks. In a block {A 1, A 2,…, Ak} each element is assumed to be <b>handcuffed</b> to its neighbors and the block contains k − 1 <b>handcuffed</b> pairs (A 1, A 2), (A 2, A 1), …, (Ak− 1, Ak). These pairs are considered unordered. The collection of <b>handcuffed</b> blocks constitutes a <b>handcuffed</b> design if the following are satisfied: (1) each element of the v-set appears amongst the blocks the same number of times (and at most once in a block) and (2) each pair of distinct elements of the v-set are <b>handcuffed</b> in exactly λ of the blocks. If the total number of blocks is b and each element appears in r blocks the following conditions are necessary for the <b>handcuffed</b> design to exist. (1) λv (v − 1) = (k − 1) b. (2) rv = kb. In this paper it is shown that the necessary conditions are also sufficient...|$|R

5|$|In December 1976, Bukovsky was {{forcibly}} deported {{from the}} USSR and exchanged at Zürich airport by the Soviet {{government for the}} imprisoned {{general secretary of the}} Communist Party of Chile, Luis Corvalán. In his 1978 autobiography Bukovsky describes how he was brought to Switzerland in <b>handcuffs.</b> The widely publicised exchange increased public awareness in the West about Soviet dissidents.|$|E
5|$|When Monk and Sharona's flight lands at Newark Liberty International Airport, Monk stalls Stefan's {{connecting}} flight to Paris by wittingly {{saying that the}} captain of the Paris flight is drunk. This allows Disher and the construction crew to excavate and find the body. The Newark Police Department shows up, and Stefan and his mistress are led away in <b>handcuffs.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the meal, Starling {{tries to}} attack Lecter, but he overpowers her. She <b>handcuffs</b> his wrist to hers. Hearing the police closing in, Lecter threatens to sever her cuffed hand to escape. Lecter is later {{seen on a}} flight with his own boxed lunch, his arm in a sling. As he prepares to eat his meal, {{including}} what {{is assumed to be}} part of a cooked brain, a young boy seated next to him asks to try some of his food. Initially reluctant, Lecter then assents.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA <b>handcuffed</b> {{design with}} {{parameters}} ν, k, λ {{consists of a}} set of ordered k-subsets of a v-set, called <b>handcuffed</b> blocks; in a block (a 1, a 2, ak) each element is assumed to be “handcuffed” to its neighbors. A block, therefore, contains k − 1 <b>handcuffed</b> pairs, the pairs being considered unordered. Each element of the v-set appears in exactly r blocks, and each pair of distinct elements of the v-set is <b>handcuffed</b> in exactly A blocks of the design. These designs have been studied recently by Hung and Mendelsohn [1], who construct a number of families of such designs by recursive methods. In this paper we show how difference methods {{can be applied to the}} construction of <b>handcuffed</b> designs. The methods are powerful, and a number of families of designs are constructed. A main new result is the determination of necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of <b>handcuffed</b> designs for all parameter sets in which v is an odd prime power...|$|R

5|$|David Gilbertson, {{a former}} {{assistant}} inspector {{who had worked for}} the Home Office formulating policing policy, told The New York Times that the British police used to act with the sanction of the public, but that tactics had changed after a series of violent assaults on officers in the 1990s. Now dressing in military-style uniforms and equipped with anti-stab vests, extendable metal batons and clubs that turn into <b>handcuffs,</b> an entire generation of officers has come to regard the public as the enemy, the newspaper said.|$|E
5|$|Norrington escapes {{with the}} heart amid a battle with Jones's crew, and Jones summons the Kraken. Realizing Sparrow is the target, Elizabeth traps him aboard the Black Pearl as the crew {{abandons}} the ship, and kisses him while she <b>handcuffs</b> him to the mast. Then, the monster devours Sparrow and drags the ship and his soul to Davy Jones's Locker. The surviving crew seeks refuge with Tia Dalma who produces a captain she says can rescue Sparrow: it was her doing that brought Barbossa back to life.|$|E

It flies above the prison's walls as General Wheeler arrives. Colonel Winter is led away in <b>handcuffs.</b> The inmates build a new wall as memorial to their fallen comrades. Aguilar and Irwin's names are among those carved onto the castle's wall.|$|E
2500|$|Initially {{there was}} {{disagreement}} about whether Grant was <b>handcuffed</b> {{before he was}} shot. Court filings by the district attorney's office say that Grant's hands were {{behind his back and}} that he was [...] "restrained and unarmed" [...] but do not say he was <b>handcuffed.</b> Mehserle voiced his fear that Grant was [...] "going for his waistband." [...] The day after the shooting, BART spokesman Jim Allison said that Grant was not restrained when he was shot, and multiple witnesses testified that Grant refused to give up his hands for <b>handcuffing</b> prior to the shooting. [...] The family's claim against BART stated that Grant was <b>handcuffed</b> only after he was shot.|$|R

Before he can leave, Modell is {{surrounded}} and arrested by FBI agents led by Frank Burst (Vic Polizos). While being escorted away in a police car, he repeatedly talks about the color cerulean blue. Modell's talking seemingly causes the driver to not see an approaching big rig of that color, causing a collision. Modell escapes after the driver unlocks his <b>handcuffs</b> before dying.|$|E
5|$|United Nations Security {{officers}} are generally responsible for security within the UN Headquarters. They {{are equipped with}} weapons and <b>handcuffs</b> and may be mistaken for NYPD officers, due to similarity in uniforms. The NYPD's 17th Precinct patrols the area around and near the complex, but does not have jurisdiction inside the UN headquarters themselves since the headquarters are considered international property.|$|E

5|$|Bokhary's first {{brush with}} the police {{was in the early}} hours of 24 June 2001, when the manager of a bar in Central {{district}} of Hong Kong reported to police that she was causing a disturbance. When police officers arrived and attempted to arrest Bokhary, she hit one officer on the cheek; it took four officers at the scene to put her in <b>handcuffs.</b> Police also found a plastic bag with small amounts of cocaine on her person. She was found guilty of the assault and fined HK$9,000 (US$1,153). She was held not guilty of cocaine possession because of doubts over the evidence.|$|E
5|$|Burtt {{had visited}} Niagara Falls in 1987 {{and used his}} {{recordings}} from his trip for the sounds of wind. He ran around a hall with a canvas bag up to record the sandstorm though. For the scene where WALL-E runs from falling shopping carts, Burtt and his daughter went to a supermarket and placed a recorder in their cart. They crashed it around {{the parking lot and}} then let it tumble down a hill. To create Hal (WALL-E's pet cockroach)'s skittering, he recorded the clicking caused by taking apart and reassembling <b>handcuffs.</b>|$|E
5|$|Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents {{arrived at}} the airport after the plane landed. The {{aircraft}} was moved to a remote area so authorities could re-screen the plane, the passengers, and the baggage on board. A bomb-defusing robot was first used to board the plane, and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) interviewed all passengers. Another passenger from the flight was placed in <b>handcuffs</b> after a dog alerted officers to his carry-on luggage; he was searched, and released without charges. For several days following, federal officials denied that this second handcuffing had occurred, they later reversed this position, confirming that a second passenger had been handcuffed.|$|E
50|$|As soon as {{restraints}} go on, {{the officer}} has full liability.

5|$|In the {{original}} Final Fight, Poison and Roxy both utilized standing and acrobatic flip kicks {{to attack the}} player. As one of the fighters in Final Fight Revenge, her moveset was expanded heavily, and she was armed with a whip. The whip is used primarily in her Cat Claw and Thunder Whip attacks (which are comparable to Shoryuken/Shinryūken styled attacks, respectively), {{and can be used}} to steal a weapon from the opponent. Additionally, her <b>handcuffs</b> can be thrown as a horizontal projectile move to immobilize the opponent for a short time.|$|E
