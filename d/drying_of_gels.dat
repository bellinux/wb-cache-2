The effect of doping with Sb (V) on the structure and the morphology of the material was investigated by XRD, SEM and nitrogen sorption. Our materials showed reasonable specific surface areas (85 m²/g). The bimodal narrow pore size distribution, centered on around 25 and 45 nm after calcination at 600 °C, is particularly well adapted to the foreseen application. Sb doped aerogel exhibited an impressive improvement of electronic conductivity, reaching 0. 13 S/cm. This is representing a 4 orders of magnitude increase compared to pure SnO 2.

Pressure is applied evenly to the gel (either using suction, or by placing a stack of paper towels and a weight on top of the membrane and gel), to ensure good and even contact between gel and membrane. If transferring by suction, 20X SSC buffer is used to ensure a seal and prevent <b>drying</b> <b>of</b> the <b>gel.</b> Buffer transfer by capillary action from a region of high water potential to a region of low water potential (usually filter paper and paper tissues) is then used to move the DNA from the gel onto the membrane; ion exchange interactions bind the DNA to the membrane due to the negative charge of the DNA and positive charge of the membrane.|$|R
40|$|Relevance of {{the work}} was caused by absence {{information}} about complex research of regularities of Ta[2]O[5] formation by sol-gel method. Powders of tantal(V) oxide was obtained by sol-gel method from alcohol solution of tantal(V) chloride. In present work by IR spectroscopy, thermal analysis with mass spectrometry and X-ray diffraction the composition <b>of</b> sol and <b>dried</b> <b>gel</b> was determined. It was found that thermal destruction <b>of</b> <b>dried</b> <b>gel</b> at 600 °C leads to obtaining rhombic crystal phase [beta]- Ta[2]O[5]...|$|R
