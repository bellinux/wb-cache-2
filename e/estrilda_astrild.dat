40|$|Control of {{invasive}} {{birds in the}} Balearic Islands. The introduction of exotic invasive birds can lead to increased rarity and extinction of native birds, especially on islands. This paper reviews the situation in these islands, in particular for five which have adjusted to local conditions and are breeding: ringnecked parakeet Psittacula krameri and egyptian goose Alopochen aegyptiacus – with non expanding populations; and the monk parakeet Myiopsitta monachus, common myna Acridotheres tristis and common waxbill <b>Estrilda</b> <b>astrild</b> – all three naturalised and well established. The Balearic Species Protection Service is undertaking a campaign for the eradication of the common myna, and is well advanced with another to eradicate the common waxbill, whilst it is also taking action to control {{the population of the}} monk parakeet...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The common waxbill, <b>Estrilda</b> <b>astrild</b> (L., 1758) (Passeriformes: Estrildidae) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird {{native to}} Sub-Saharan Africa that has been introduced into several regions of the world. Results In the present paper, eight mite species (Acariformes) are reported from this host from Brazil, including three species new to science: Montesauria caravela n. sp., M. conquistador n. sp. (Proctophyllodidae), Trouessartia transatlantica n. sp., T. minuscula Gaud & Mouchet, 1958, T. estrildae Gaud & Mouchet, 1958 (Trouessartiidae), Onychalges pachyspathus Gaud, 1968 (Pyroglyphidae), Paddacoptes paddae (Fain, 1964) (Dermationidae) and Neocheyletiella megaphallos (Lawrence, 1959) (Cheyletidae). Comparative material from Africa was also studied. Conclusions These mites represent at least three morpho-ecological groups regarding their microhabitats occupied on the bird: (i) vane mites (Montesauria and Trouessartia on the large wing and tail feathers); (ii) down mites (Onychalges); and (iii) skin mites (Paddacoptes and Neocheyletiella). On one bird individual we found representatives of all eight mite species. Although the common waxbill {{was introduced to the}} Neotropical region almost two centuries ago, we demonstrate that it still retains its Old World acarofauna and has not yet acquired any representatives of typical Neotropical mite taxa...|$|E
40|$|Many birds acquire {{carotenoid}} pigments {{from the}} diet that they deposit into feathers and bare parts to develop extravagant sexual coloration. Although biologists have shown interest {{in both the}} mechanisms and function of these colorful displays, the carotenoids ingested and processed by these birds are poorly described. Here we document the carotenoid-pigment profile in the diet, blood and tissue of captive male and female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). Dietary carotenoids including: lutein; zeaxanthin; and b-cryptoxanthin were also present in the plasma, liver, adipose tissue and egg-yolk. These were accompanied in the blood and tissues by a fourth pigment, 29, 39 -anhydrolutein, that was absent from the diet. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} reported documentation of anhydrolutein in any avian species; among animals, it has been previously described only in human skin and serum and in fish liver. We also identified anhydrolutein in the plasma of two closely related estrildid finch species (<b>Estrilda</b> <b>astrild</b> and Sporaeginthus subflavus). Anhydrolutein was the major carotenoid found in zebra finch serum and liver, but did not exceed the concentration of lutein and zeaxanthin in adipose tissue or egg yolk. Whereas the percent composition of zeaxanthin and b-cryptoxanthin were similar between diet and plasma, lutein was comparatively less abundant in plasma than in the diet. Lutein also was proportionally deficient in plasma from birds that circulated a higher percentage of anhydrolutein. These results suggest that zebra finches metabolically derive anhydrolutein from dietary sources of lutein. The production site an...|$|E
40|$|The {{distributions}} of many species {{are not at}} equilibrium with their environment. This includes spreading non-native species and species undergoing range shifts in response to climate change. The habitat associations of these species may change during range expansion as less favourable climatic conditions at expanding range margins constrain species to use only the most favourable habitats, violating the species distribution model assumption of stationarity. Alternatively, changes in habitat associations could result from density-dependent habitat selection; at range margins, population densities are initially low so species can exhibit density-independent selection of the most favourable habitats, while in the range core, where population densities are higher, species spread into less favourable habitat. We investigate if the habitat preferences of the non-native common waxbill <b>Estrilda</b> <b>astrild</b> changed as they spread in three directions (north, east and south-east) in the Iberian Peninsula. There are different degrees of climatic suitability and colonization speed across range expansion axes, allowing us to separate the effects of climate from residence time. In contrast to previous studies we find a stronger effect of residence time than climate in influencing the prevalence of common waxbills. As well as a strong additive effect of residence time, there were some changes in habitat associations, which were consistent with density-dependent habitat selection. The combination of broader habitat associations and higher prevalence in areas that have been colonised for longer means that species distribution models constructed early in the invasion process are likely to underestimate species’ potential distribution...|$|E
40|$|The {{dominant}} criterion {{to determine}} when an introduced species is established relies on {{the maintenance of a}} self-sustaining population in the area of introduction, i. e. on the viability of the population from a demographic perspective. There is however a paucity of demographic studies on introduced species, and establishment success is thus generally determined by expert opinion without undertaking population viability analyses (PVAs). By means of an intensive five year capture-recapture monitoring program (involving > 12, 000 marked individuals) we studied the demography of five introduced passerine bird species in southern Spain which are established and have undergone a fast expansion over the last decades. We obtained useful estimates of demographic parameters (survival and reproduction) for one colonial species (Ploceus melanocephalus), confirming the long-term viability of its local population through PVAs. However, extremely low recapture rates prevented the estimation of survival parameters and population growth rates for widely distributed species with low local densities (Estrilda troglodytes and Amandava amandava) but also for highly abundant yet non-colonial species (<b>Estrilda</b> <b>astrild</b> and Euplectes afer). Therefore, determining the establishment success of introduced passerine species by demographic criteria alone may often be troublesome even when devoting much effort to field-work. Alternative quantitative methodologies such as the analysis of spatio-temporal species distributions complemented with expert opinion deserve thus their role in the assessment of establishment success of introduced species when estimates of demographic parameters are difficult to obtain, as is generally the case for non-colonial, highly mobile passerines...|$|E
40|$|Different {{approaches}} {{can be used}} {{to model}} the spread of invasive species. Here we demonstrate the use of survival regression, an approach that {{can be used to}} study a variety of events, not just death, to model the time to colonization. The advantage of survival regression to study colonisation of new areas is that information on those areas that have not been invaded by the end of a study can be included in the analysis, thus potentially increasing the accuracy of parameter estimation. We use proportional hazards regression (PHR; a type of survival regression) to model the spread of the common waxbill <b>Estrilda</b> <b>astrild</b> in Portugal. The species invaded Portugal in two peaks of invasion between 1964 and 1999. We built a PHR model with the information available up to the first invasion peak, then used this model to predict the pattern of invasion in the second peak. PHR had useful forecasting capabilities: areas that were actually colonised by 1999 had significantly higher hazards of colonization based on information from the first wave of invasion than areas that were not colonised. We then built a final model of expansion of the common waxbill that combined all available data up to 1999. Among climate variables, the most important predictor of colonization was temperature, followed by relative humidity. We used this model to estimate the invasion potential of the species under climate change scenarios, observing that an increase of 18 C in mean annual temperature increased the risk of a new invasion by 47 %. Our analyses suggest that survival regression may be a useful tool for studying the geographical spread of invasive species. However, PHR was conceived as a descriptive technique rather than as a predictive tool, and thus further research is needed to empirically test the predictive capabilities of PHR...|$|E
40|$|Non-native {{species can}} be major drivers of {{biodiversity}} loss and cause economic damage. Predicting the potential distribution of a non-native species, {{and understanding the}} environmental factors that limit this distribution, is useful for informing their potential management. This is often carried out using species distribution models (SDMs) that attempt to classify grid cells as suitable or unsuitable for a species based {{on a set of}} environmental covariates. A key assumption of SDMs is that a species is in equilibrium with its environment. Spreading non-native species often violate this assumption due to dispersal limitation. We present a simple method for dealing with this problem: dispersal weighting (DW). This uses the probability that a species can disperse to a grid cell to weight a SDM. We use simulations to compare the ability of DW and unweighted models at parameterising the true species-environment relationship (SER) of a simulated species, and to test their ability at predicting the future distribution of this species. We investigate how varying the degree of spatial autocorrelation in explanatory variables affects the performance of the methods. Dispersal weighting models outperformed unweighted models at parameterising the SER, and at predicting the future distribution of the species when dispersal probabilities were incorporated into the model predictions. Unweighted models had a stronger tendency than DW models to overestimate the magnitude of relationships with spatially autocorrelated explanatory variables, but underestimate the magnitude of relationships with randomly distributed variables. We then applied our method to a real case study, using it to model the distribution of the non-native common waxbill <b>Estrilda</b> <b>astrild</b> in the Iberian Peninsula as a function of climate and land-use variables. The relative performance of DW and unweighted models reflected the results of the simulation. We conclude that DW models perform better than unweighted models at modelling the true SER of non-native species, and recommend using DW whenever enough data exist to create a dispersal model. © 2012 The Authors.

40|$|Increasing {{numbers of}} species are being transported beyond their natural range {{boundaries}} by humans. These non-native species can have severe negative impacts on native biodiversity. In order to guide management {{of these species}} {{it is important to}} be able predict where non-native species will spread to, and what impact they will have. This thesis aims to improve our understanding in both these areas, using the expansion of non-native birds in the Iberian Peninsula as a study system. The number of non-native passerines in the Iberian Peninsula has increased in the late 20 th century, with the common waxbill <b>Estrilda</b> <b>astrild,</b> yellow-crowned bishop Euplectes afer, red avadavat Amandava amandava and black-headed weaver Ploceus melanocephalus all established as breeding species since 1960. Methods to (1) account for dispersal limitation when modelling the distribution of spreading non-native species and (2) evaluate the likely transferability of native trained species distribution models were developed. The consistency of the species-environment relationship during expansion in the non-native range was also examined. The ability of vacant niches to facilitate the spread of non-native species was tested, and a framework for detecting the early impacts of non-native species was developed. Species distribution models of the potential distribution of non-native species are improved by incorporating dispersal. Dispersal is an important constraint on the distribution of non-native species, and interacts with environmental suitability to alter the species-environment relationship between the range-margin and the range core, and over time. Despite accounting for dispersal limitation in their evaluation, the performance of native-trained species distribution models was poor when most environmental conditions that were analogous to the species native range were within the species niche. Non-native birds in the Iberian Peninsula utilised similar resources to native seed-eating birds, but small differences in resource utilisation allowed them to exploit rice fields, where resources were under-exploited by native species. Non-native birds could also interact with native reedbed nesting passerines, and indeed aggression between black-headed weavers and native Acrocephalus warblers has been recorded. However, we did not find evidence for competition between these species at current population densities of black-headed weavers. Further work on non-native species needs to extend the hybrid dispersal-species distribution models developed here, and also to conduct more assessments of the impacts of non-native species in the early stages of their invasion...|$|E
