Using this model, a flexible visual programming tool is designed {{not only to}} configure/control various common types of <b>brushing</b> <b>techniques</b> currently used in dynamic data visualization, but also to investigate new <b>brushing</b> <b>techniques...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Lives of {{adolescents}} {{is a very}} turbulent life, idealistic and highly sensitive to the symptoms in the environment. Teenagers are the most beautiful, and passionate. In a teenager's life is very fragile and very susceptible {{to the influence of}} social modernization, which is characterized by freedom, and began to leave the traditional oriental cultures. Promiscuity teen promiscuity modernization expressed by sex free, wild race culture, drinking, taking drugs and other harmful substances. With the title "Youth Smoking in the Age of Promiscuity Modernization As Art Creation Idea" aims to visualize the juvenile delinquency in the era of modernization in the form of distorted figures, and the benefits achieved to inform the public about the negative adolescent promiscuity can damage morale and life. Through the language of the various symbols esthetic, creator of the idea of combining ideas, and the preparation of elements to realize a work of art with a <b>dry</b> <b>brush</b> <b>technique</b> and the technique dusel, and coupled with a pencil and scratch conte wild. In the process of work using the methods of exploration stage, stages of improvisation, and stage of forming. Key words: Intercourse Free, Teens, Modernization, Ar...|$|E

40|$|International audienceUsing {{analytical}} and numerical self-consistent field (SCF) methods we analyze equilibrium structure of <b>dry</b> (solvent-free) <b>brush</b> of branched polymers in {{wide range of}} chain grafting densities. A detailed analysis is performed for starlike polymers end-tethered to planar surface by terminal monomer {{of one of their}} branches. At moderate grafting densities ensuring Gaussian elasticity of tethered stars the brush structure is described by strong stretching SS-SCF theory employing parabolic molecular potential. At high grafting densities an approximate analytical AA-SCF theory is used to describe stratification of <b>dry</b> <b>brush.</b> Analytical predictions are supplemented by results of numerical Scheutjens-Fleer SF-SCF model. Interpenetration between <b>dry</b> <b>brushes</b> is analyzed as a function of grafting density and degree of branching of tethered chains. Comparison of interpenetration and friction between <b>dry</b> <b>brushes</b> with varied chain architectures pointed at optimal lubrication by macrocycles tethered to the surface by branching point. It is demonstrated that shear stress in sliding brushes of starlike macromolecules sharply decreases at high grafting densities corresponding to almost full stretching of the longest elastic path in the polymers...|$|R
