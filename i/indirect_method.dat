5|$|In the {{indirect}} or French process, metallic zinc is melted in a graphite crucible and vaporized at temperatures above 907°C (typically around 1000°C). Zinc vapor reacts with the {{oxygen in the}} air to give ZnO, accompanied by a drop in its temperature and bright luminescence. Zinc oxide particles are transported into a cooling duct and collected in a bag house. This <b>indirect</b> <b>method</b> was popularized by LeClaire (France) in 1844 and therefore is commonly known as the French process. Its product normally consists of agglomerated zinc oxide particles with an average size of 0.1 to a few micrometers. By weight, most of the world's zinc oxide is manufactured via French process.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese had {{developed}} the position considerably, establishing a complex defensive network and, whereas {{up until that}} point they had usually withdrawn {{in the face of}} the advancing Australians, they decided to make a stand. Employing a 75mm gun, which was fired over open sights due to the closeness of the fighting, along with some 37mm guns and a number of machine guns of varying calibre, they fought fiercely. Halted by fire, the Australians called in fire support to overwhelm the Japanese with fire superiority, and resorting to employing the <b>indirect</b> <b>method</b> that would characterise their operations during this phase of the advance, and which was necessitated by the depleted state of their forces. Moving up a steep slope that was covered by kunai grass, one of the tanks broke down, nevertheless the Australian armour was able to deliver a significant bombardment which enabled the infantry to take the position early in the evening.|$|E

Subsequent histologically defined atlas maps {{can also be used to}} verify the target area. The direct method provides visualization and targeting of deep nuclei by applying stereotactic preoperative MRI, which unlike the <b>indirect</b> <b>method,</b> takes into account the anatomic variation of the nuclei’s size, position, and functional segregation amongst individuals.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has found that people are little better than chance at accurately judging if someone is lying or telling the truth. As such, recent studies have proposed alternative ways of judging veracity in order to increase accuracy. In the current study, researchers examined whether <b>indirect</b> <b>methods</b> of detecting lies led to more accurate judgements of veracity than direct methods. 40 participants viewed a number of video clips in which the speaker was either lying or being truthful. Participants were either directly asked to detect liars in the video clips or they were asked to identify individuals whose behaviour, mannerisms or speech patterns changed throughout the interview (<b>indirect</b> <b>methods).</b> It was presumed that participants using the <b>indirect</b> <b>methods</b> of lie detection would be significantly more accurate at judging veracity than those who were explicitly looking for liars. However, upon analysis of the research, although those in the <b>indirect</b> <b>methods</b> condition were more accurate, no statistically significant findings were found between the two conditions. Therefore, a different method of judging veracity is required in order to increase accuracy.

25|$|Breweries and biofuel plants employ {{two methods}} for {{measuring}} ethanol concentration. Infrared ethanol sensors measure the vibrational frequency of dissolved ethanol using the CH band at 2900cm−1. This method uses a relatively inexpensive solid state sensor that compares the CH band with a reference band {{to calculate the}} ethanol content. The calculation makes use of the Beer-Lambert law. Alternatively, by measuring {{the density of the}} starting material and the density of the product, using a hydrometer, the change in specific gravity during fermentation indicates the alcohol content.

25|$|While {{significantly}} {{resistant to}} heat and radiation, endospores can {{be destroyed by burning}} or by autoclaving at a temperature exceeding {{the boiling point}} of water, 100°C. Endospores are able to survive at 100°C for hours, although the longer the number of hours the fewer that will survive. An indirect way to destroy them is to place them in an environment that reactivates them to their vegetative state. They will germinate within a day or two with the right environmental conditions, and then the vegetative cells, not as hardy as endospores, can be straightforwardly destroyed. This <b>indirect</b> <b>method</b> is called Tyndallization. It was the usual method for a while in the late 19th century before the introduction of inexpensive autoclaves. Prolonged exposure to ionising radiation, such as x-rays and gamma rays, will also kill most endospores.|$|E

25|$|The {{presence}} of dorsal fins in ichthyosaurs has been controversial. Finely preserved specimens from the Holzmaden Lagerstätten in Germany {{found in the}} late nineteenth century revealed additional traces, usually preserved in black, of the outline of the entire body, including the first evidence of dorsal fins in ichthyosaurs. Unique conditions permitted the preservation of these outlines, which probably consist of bacterial mats, not the remains of the original tissues themselves. In 1987, David Martill argued that, given the <b>indirect</b> <b>method</b> of conservation by bacteria, it was unlikely that these outlines were reliably preserved in any fine detail. He concluded that no authentic dorsal fins had been discovered. After displaced skins flaps from the body would have initially been misinterpreted as fins, fossil preparators later came to expect such fins to be present, and would have identified any discolouration in the appropriate position as a dorsal fin or even have falsified such structures. The lack of a dorsal fin would also explain why ichthyosaurs, contrary to porpoises, retained hind flippers, as these were needed for stability. Other researchers noted that, while the outlines might have been sharpened and smoothed by preparators because fossil bacterial mats usually have indistinct edges, many of the preserved dorsal fins were probably authentic and at least somewhat close to the true body outline. At least one specimen, R158 (in the collections of the Paleontologiska Museet, Uppsala Universitet), shows the expected faded edges of a bacterial mat, so it has not been altered by preparators, yet still preserves a generally tuna-like body outline including a dorsal fin. In 1993, Martill admitted that at least some dorsal fin specimens are authentic.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>indirect</b> <b>method</b> {{estimates}} leeway {{by subtracting}} a sea current vector {{from the total}} displacement vector to estimate the leeway vector. This method was riddled with data collection errors from slippage errors on the drifting buoys to navigational errors in determining the buoys position.

Furthermore, winds were determined by anemometers readings, which tended to overestimate the wind speed at the 10-meter reference level.

The first leeway study that used the direct method was conducted by Suzuki and Sato (1977).

2500|$|Geodetic {{methods are}} an <b>indirect</b> <b>method</b> for the {{determination}} of mass balance of glacier. Maps of a glacier made at two different points in time can be compared and the difference in glacier thickness observed {{used to determine the}} mass balance over a span of years. This is best accomplished today using Differential Global Positioning System. Sometimes the earliest data for the glacier surface profiles is from images that are used to make topographical maps and digital elevation models. Aerial mapping or photogrammetry is now used to cover larger glaciers and icecaps such found in Antarctica and Greenland, however, because of the problems of establishing accurate ground control points in mountainous terrain, and correlating features in snow and where shading is common, elevation errors are typically not less than 10m (32ft). Laser altimetry provides a measurement of the elevation of a glacier along a specific path, e.g., the glacier centerline. The difference of two such measurements is the change in thickness, which provides mass balance over the time interval between the measurements. [...] Again a good method over a span of time but not for annual change detection. The value of geodetic programs is providing an independent check of traditional mass balance work, by comparing the cumulative changes over ten or more years.|$|E
