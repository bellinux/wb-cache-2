500|$|A fifth {{film with}} Hepburn came in 1948, Frank Capra's {{political}} drama State of the Union. Tracy played {{a presidential candidate}} in the movie, which was warmly received. He then appeared in Edward, My Son (1949) with Deborah Kerr. Tracy disliked the role, and told director George Cukor, [...] "It's rather disconcerting to me to find how easily <b>I</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> heel." [...] Upon its release, The New Yorker wrote of the [...] "hopeless miscasting of Mr. Tracy". The film became Tracy's biggest money-loser at MGM.|$|E

500|$|Chaitanya {{is seen as}} {{the father}} of a six-year-old in 1980s and a happy-go-lucky college student in 2013. He {{described}} the former role as a challenging one. He also said that both the roles would have multiple layers and added, [...] "The film as you all would know by now, is spread across three generations, and all the characters go back and forth in time. <b>I</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> happy-go-lucky college guy in the present era. It's a typically fun character and has nothing in common with my character from the flashback. So acting wise, it was a big challenge".

The only problem is, I don't know all the words. So if you know them, sing along." [...] After watching the performance online, Gaga posted his cover on her Twitter account along with the words [...] "Swoon! Nick Jonas singing The Edge of Glory. On my way to press conference in Taichung, listening to it. So dreamy! X." [...] British band Friendly Fires covered the song during BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge. Kevin O'Donnell of Spin praised their cover writing: [...] "Gaga's original showcases the pop star's gale force pipes, and Friendly Fires frontman Ed Macfarlane doesn't try to match that energy. Instead, they offer a lovely, cinematic take on the song: Macfarlane croons with the heart-on-sleeve sensitivity of an emo-boy over cascading synth melodies and a breezy funk pulse. Nice!" ...|$|E

He utilized a heat transfer technique learned from fellow artist Ann Beam, with his work on paper and Plexiglas. He also began working with photo emulsion and mixed media on paper and large scale canvas works. The works contained various juxtapositions of imagery from the spiritual, the natural, and political world, and incorporated his own poetic inscriptions and math equations. [...] "My works are like little puzzles, interesting little games. <b>I</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> game of dreaming ourselves as each other. In this {{we find out that}} we're all basically human....

He has often stated that the lack of musical Academy training was of course a disadvantage, but this was compensated by the advantage of being an actor who composes for fellow-actors and senses their need on the stage or on the screen: [...] "After all, if you had the right professors and they were good in a certain art (which was my case) they could teach you the rules of arts in a way to use them in another field of your muses. Because the rules of art are universal. For me there’s no difference if <b>I</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> character, compose music or write poetry for my songs, it’s all about telling stories, communication, sharing thoughts and emotions, about the ability to stretch and push the boundaries with visions of your own world".|$|E

Maggie's next romance is with character Jonathan Lavery, a relationship brought on by her hurt feelings, as well as feeling second best to Bianca's other best friend, Babe Carey (Maggie's cousin once removed). Maggie and Jonathan's romance was new territory for Hendrickson, as her character's sexual activity increased:Because <b>I</b> <b>play</b> <b>a</b> sexually confused character, I have not {{had to do a}} lot of sex scenes (giggles).
