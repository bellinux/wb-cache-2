40|$|Abstract: Owing to its alleged market neutrality, {{and more}} importantly, its {{exemption}} from World Trade Organization commitments, <b>decoupled</b> <b>income</b> <b>support</b> is {{an increasingly important}} component of farm policy in developed countries. This study empirically evaluates the United States ’ experience with direct payments using a partial equilibrium model of agricultural production and trade. Simulation {{results indicate that the}} extent to which direct payments affect production and trade depends on crop specific factors in addition to the degree of coupling. Policy makers and trade negotiators must consider the relative level of support made to and the unique market situation of agricultural products covered by <b>decoupled</b> <b>income</b> <b>support</b> policies...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} extent to which <b>decoupled</b> <b>income</b> <b>support</b> {{measures}} in agriculture can have production implications both at the extensive and intensive margins. We develop a theoretical framework that analyzes production responses of agricultural producers to apparently decoupled payments, by explicitly considering risk attitudes and uncertainty. We use farm-level data collected in Kansas to estimate the model. Technology and risk preference parameters are jointly estimated. Results show that though lump sum payments are not fully decoupled in the presence of risk and uncertainty, their effects on agricultural production are likely to be of a very small magnitude.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of the first SAM analysis of the agricultural sector in Italy. A SAM of the Italian economy has been properly modified in order to focus the analysis on agriculture. Two type of analysis have been carried out: (i) a multiplier analysis, and (ii) an assessment of the distributive impacts of different agricultural policies. This paper proposes also a new method for disaggregating the institutional sectors and production factors in order to analyze income distribution within the economy, with special emphasis on the agricultural sector. Main results are: (i) "fully" <b>decoupled</b> <b>income</b> <b>supporting</b> schemes (transfers to agricultural households) are the most equitable interventions and determine a perfect targeting of the distributive effect on the relevant institutional sectors; (ii) "partially" <b>decoupled</b> <b>income</b> <b>supporting</b> interventions, as the ones implemented under the current CAP, are more effective than others in indirectly (i. e., through multiplier effects) generating positive impacts on the income of agricultural households; (iii) agricultural price support interventions show less desirable effects in terms of their distributive impacts: they are less effective as agricultural income-increasing policies and their distributive impacts are biased against poorer households both in agricultural and non-agricultural sectors.

40|$|The {{shift of}} the farm {{subsidies}} toward programs classified as being <b>decoupled</b> <b>income</b> <b>supports</b> in the WTO’s URAA {{raises the question of}} their true impact on production and trade. In this study, we measured the acreage effects of the Canadian whole farm programs under uncertainty. Based on the theoretical discussions regarding the role of the insurance effect in acreage decisions, we extend the theoretical restrictions examined by Chavas and Holt (1990) which enables us to include this effect in our model specification. Hence, we modified the expected utility maximization framework (under the hypothesis that farmers are risk averse) developed by Chavas and Holt (1990) and derived three distinct effects: market effects, the wealth effect, and the insurance effect.

Simulation results show that the 2003 CAP reform will not only reduce average cost of production, but may also improve environmental conditions regarding soil, water, and greenhouse gases.

40|$|This thesis {{includes}} an introductory chapter and four individual papers. The papers are {{held together by}} concepts associated with price formation in real estate markets, differentiated goods and the local character of land and housing markets. The first two papers focus on the markets for land and agricultural property and the two succeeding studies on housing markets. The first study examines regional variations of Swedish agricultural land prices. The associated empirical model follows the form of earlier literature in testing the influence of expected returns from the current agricultural use of land {{and the potential for}} non-agricultural use on prices. The use of market transacted land and the inclusion of <b>decoupled</b> <b>income</b> <b>support</b> to farmers, among a set of agricultural and non-agricultural factors, distinguishes this study from earlier empirical work. The second paper relates to the first by its focus on <b>decoupled</b> <b>income</b> <b>support,</b> but here the analysis extends to the micro level and to the study of price formation in the market for agricultural property. The study applies a spatial multilevel model to study variations in price determinants across and within local and regional markets. The third paper is devoted to the analysis of housing prices and their relation to open landscape amenities. The spatial analysis employs two geographical databases containing single-family home sales and preserved open spaces. In order to address the local character of urban housing markets and intraurban heterogeneity in amenity valuations the study applies a geographically weighted regression approach. The last paper focuses on the market for second homes with a particular emphasis on urban-rural interrelations. The paper is motivated by a growing demand for natural amenities and by the awareness that urban areas are becoming increasingly attractive markets for second homes...|$|E

40|$|The European Union {{reformed}} farm {{policy in}} June 2003 towards the <b>decoupling</b> of farm <b>income</b> <b>support</b> instruments.

However, these studies assume that the previous reform, under Agenda 2000, already decoupled arable crop direct payments to a considerable extent, while beef premiums were linked more closely to production. Our main objective in this paper is to test the sensitivity of these results to this questionable modelling of Agenda 2000 direct payments, which neglects eligibility rules and land market imperfections. Our analysis reveals that the effects of the reform on both arable crop and beef production are always negative, however the Agenda 2000 direct payments are modelled. On the other hand, we show that, when the eligibility rules and land market imperfections are acknowledged, the production reducing effects may be much larger for arable crops than for beef.

Besides, the government launched a public stockholding measure to ensure food security. A review of previous studies highlights the fixed payment has no or at most minimal effects on production while the variable payment carries a fairly large effect on production.

Various quantitative studies that have determined the likely impact of the SFP within the EU and the study countries are reviewed. We present the results of a farm survey conducted in the study countries in which farmers' responses to a decoupling scenario similar to the SFP were sought. We found that little short-term change was proposed in the three, rather di erent, study countries with only 30 % of the farmers stating that they would alter their mix of farm activities. Furthermore, less than 30 % of all respondents in each country would idle any land under decoupling.

40|$|The authors {{report the}} results of a study of Mexican farm {{households}} using 1991 survey data and a smaller resurvey of some of the same households in 1993. One study goal was to empirically examine the relationship between assets and the output supply function. Using a production model focusing on capital as a productive input, they found that both the supply level and the responsiveness (elasticities) to changing input and output prices tend to depend on the farmer's net assets and on how productive assets are used. Regression analysis using data from the surveys shows that farmers who use productive assets such as machinery tend to be positively responsive to price changes, while those with no access to such assets are not. Another study goal was to monitor the condition of Mexican farmers in a rapidly changing policy environment. The 1991 survey data suggest that farmers with more limited use of capital inputs (low-CI) to grow principally corn and to grow fewer crops, on average, than the others. They aso had more problems getting credit and were less likely to use purchased inputs, such as seeds, fertilizer, and pesticides, or to use a tractor to prepare the soil. They tended to be less well-educated, and their land tended to be of lower quality. Results from the panel data showed conditions generally improving for the average farmer in the sample area between 1991 and 1993, during a period when agricultural reforms were implemented. Cropping patterns were more diversified, the average size of landholdings increased, the average farmer received more credit (in real terms), more farm households earned income from off-farm work, and more farmers used purchased inputs. Asset ownership and educational attainment also improved modestly. The very small low-CI group in this sample fared as well as, or better than, the other goroups. True, their level of educational achievement fell, and fewer of them had off-farm income than in 1991. But their use of credit, irrigation, machinery, and purchased inputs increased more than for other groups. The limited data are not proof of a causal link, {{but the fact that the}} goals are being met should at least ensure that adverse conditions are not undermining reform. Farmers that lacked access to productive assets did not respond as well to incentives or take advantage of the opportunities presented by reform and may need assistance, particularly to get access to credit markets. There may be a good argument for <b>decoupling</b> <b>income</b> <b>supports</b> from pricesupports for farmers, since income payments that are independent of the vagaries of production could provide a more stable signal of creditworthiness than price supports do. Possibly reorienting research and extension services more to the needs of low-CI producers could also improve the efficiency with which the sector ajdusts to new incentives. Hypotheses and tentative conclusions from this study will be explored further when more data are collected in 1995.

40|$|Our paper {{focuses on}} the key element of the 2003 CAP reform: on the single farm payment (SFP). The basic aim was to {{decouple}} direct payment from production decisions. Because of the widespread agricultural policy reforms (support producers with the least possible distortions) and of the on-going WTO negotiations, {{this is an issue}} attracting significant attention on behalf of agricultural economists. Different tools and different methodologies have been employed in the effort to better understand and rank policy measures in terms of their production and trade effects. Most of the literature classifies measures based on implementation criteria. Our paper assesses the decoupled nature of the single farm payment (SFP) based on WTO and OECD criteria. The EU argues that the payments do not distort trade and therefore should be placed in the WTO green box as a <b>decoupled</b> <b>income</b> <b>support.</b> Based on our analysis, this seems to be possible, as the SFP meets not only the current WTO (design based) criteria of decoupling, but can also be qualified as effective fully decoupled system using the OECD terminology.

40|$|EU trade negotiators {{have found}} it {{difficult}} to find support for EU proposals to strengthen international protection for geographical indications (GIs). Almost all other major food exporting countries are opposed to any change in WTO regulations of GIs. The European Union continues to call for a new GI policy because such a change would help EU agriculture make a desired transition away from reliance on commodity-based income supports. The European Union continues to move its farm policy away from supporting incomes with high guaranteed prices and the associated supply controls and export subsidies. In the future, incomes will be supported to a much greater degree by <b>decoupled</b> <b>income</b> <b>support</b> payments. There are many sound reasons for this policy shift, including greater consistency with the objectives of free trade agreements, greater ability to incorporate the agricultural sectors of new member countries, and, ultimately, a more competitive agricultural sector that is oriented to meeting consumer demands rather than reacting to government price signals. This last reason for moving to decoupled payments is a source of concern to some who are worried that a focus on efficiency could work against an EU policy objective of maintaining and enhancing populations in rural area...|$|E
40|$|A crucial {{element of}} the post- 2013 Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform is the ‘greening’ payment. ‘Greening’ is a {{compulsory}} {{part of the new}} direct payment scheme, accounting for 30 per cent of national ceilings. To qualify, farmers must undertake compulsory agricultural practices that are ‘beneficial for the climate and the environment’, comprising crop diversification, maintenance of existing permanent grassland and establishing an ecological focus area or putting in place ‘equivalent measures’. The payment had a controversial legislative passage, with several environmental groups questioning its pro-environmental effects and alleging that it was merely a clever way of disguising product support to European Union (EU) farmers, even before several of the provisions were watered down by the European Parliament. Despite these difficulties, throughout the process all parties assumed the ‘greening’ payment was compatible with the Green Box exemption in the Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) of the World Trade Organization (WTO), so that it would be exempt from the EU’s domestic support reduction commitments in that Agreement. Specifically, it was understood that the payment would be <b>decoupled</b> <b>income</b> <b>support</b> under paragraph 6 of Annex 2 to the AoA and as such the payment had ‘no, or at most minimal trade-distorting effects or effects on production’ under paragraph 1 of the same Annex (the so-called ‘fundamental requirement’) ...|$|E

40|$|The United States and Canada {{share the}} longest common border and largest {{bilateral}} trading {{relationship in the}} world. Recent trading agreements [...] CUSTA, NAFTA and WTO [...] have enhanced trade by encouraging elimination of many remaining trade barriers. However, one cause for concern {{about the effectiveness of}} these trade agreements has been the frequency of Canadian-U. S. trade disputes over bilateral wheat and barley trade arrangements and trade flows. To some extent, these disputes have arisen because of differences in and lack of harmonization between the domestic and trade policies implemented by the two countries, although other political factors have also clearly been important causes of these disagreements. Since 1986, many dimensions of the agricultural policies of both countries have undergone radical changes, perhaps especially with respect to small grains and oilseeds. Here we provide assessments of whether important aspects of the two countries' domestic and trade grains and oilseeds have converged toward harmonization since implementation of the Canada-U. S. Free Trade Agreement in 1989. It {{should also be noted that}} many of the changes in each countries' agricultural policies cannot be attributed to free trade agreements. Rather, they reflect government responses to budgetary pressures, commitments under international trade agreements, changes in the relative political importance of rural and urban voters, and other factors. Changes in General Levels of Support Producer Subsidy Equivalents are indicators of the proportion of total revenues from sales of a crop resulting from government subsidies and other <b>income</b> <b>support</b> policies such as tariffs. U. S. producer subsidy equivalents for wheat and other grains have declined substantially from their 1993 - 1995 average levels as a result of the <b>decoupling</b> of <b>income</b> <b>support</b> payments under the 1996 FAIR Act. Similarly, the average wheat, other grains and oilseeds producer subsidy equivalents reported for Canada over the same period overstate current producer subsidy equivalents because of the elimination of Canadian grain transportation subsidies in 1995. Thus, generally, levels of government support for wheat and small grains have fallen quite considerably both in the U. S. and in Canada, indicating some movement in the direction of policy harmonization for these commodities. Farm <b>Income</b> <b>Supports</b> Over the past twenty years, farm <b>income</b> <b>support</b> in Canada has been delivered throughseveral different programs. Increasing budgetary pressures and a greater focus on market orientation led to the elimination of the Gross Revenue Insurance Program and the western grain transportation subsidies by 1996. The only current direct <b>income</b> <b>support</b> program is the Net Income Stabilization Account (NISA), which provides modest subsidies on interest rates paid to farmers on moneys they themselves pay into an income stabilization account. In the United States during the 1980 s and early 1990 s, changes were made to the deficiency payment/loan rate farm <b>income</b> <b>support</b> programs for wheat and small grains that tended to reduce the size of government payments to wheat and barley producers. Then, in 1996, the FAIR Act changed the entire farm <b>income</b> <b>support</b> mechanism, largely <b>decoupling</b> direct government payments to producers of those crops from current production decisions. In summary, the distortionary effects of Canadian and U. S. <b>income</b> <b>support</b> programs for wheat and other grains have been substantially curtailed, especially over the past three years. Similarly, the distortionary effects of Canadian <b>income</b> <b>support</b> programs for oilseeds have also been reduced toward the relatively modest levels associated with the U. S. oilseeds program, which has changed relatively little over the past ten years. There has been convergence in this area of farm policy. Grain Marketing and Export Subsidy Programs To the extent that U. S. export subsidy programs have become subject to GATT disciplines and funding for the U. S. export enhancement program has been reduced, the U. S. has moved toward a less distortionary set of trade policies for grains and oilseeds. The removal of freight subsidies has also moved Canada's grains trade policy in a less distortionary direction. However, Canada's export marketing board policy for wheat and barley (operated through the Canadian Wheat Board) has not changed in recent years. With respect to export credit guarantees, both countries operate roughly comparable programs, although under the GSM- 103 program, the U. S. is able to offer somewhat longer term (3 - 7 year) lines of credit. These programs have been subject only to relatively modest changes over the past ten years. On balance, there has probably been less harmonization of U. S. and Canadian export policies than of the two countries' <b>income</b> <b>support</b> programs. Thus, export policies, particularly the existence of the U. S. export enhancement program and the marketing powers of the CWB, will continue to be part of bilateral trade issues. agricultural policy, harmonization and convergence, grains, oilseeds, International Relations/Trade, Q 1,...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the effect of the 2008 Farm Bill's average crop revenue {{election}} (ACRE) program on the risk-reducing effectiveness of crop insurance products. Design/methodology/approach – Three crop/region combinations are examined, representing regions with both high and low price-yield correlation regions. Actual production history (APH) and crop revenue coverage (CRC) insurance instruments are considered separately under the 2002 Farm Bill and under ACRE. Monte Carlo simulations, combined with the copula approach, are used to simulate net wealth distributions and to calculate the corresponding expected utilities. The outcomes are evaluated using certainty-equivalent wealth based on different risk premium assumptions. Findings – Crop insurance contracts appear to be more effective under the 2002 Farm Bill than under ACRE, especially for crops characterized by low yield-price correlation. CRC insurance is found to be more effective than APH insurance for all crop/region combinations considered. Research limitations/implications – The paper only considers a static framework and farm-level insurance contracts. Further research could investigate how ACRE affects <b>decoupled</b> <b>income</b> <b>support,</b> whether the results change if Supplemental Revenue Assistance is included, or how different the outcomes might be for multiple-crop farms. Practical implications – The results suggest that risk-reducing effectiveness decreases under ACRE and that no reasonable adjustment to APH base price can make APH competitive with CRC for any crop/regions considered. Originality/value – The risk-reducing effectiveness of the 2008 Farm Bill's ACRE program is analyzed, and as a methodological contribution the copula approach is used to model the multivariate distribution of yields and prices.

40|$|In recent years, risk {{analysis}} and risk management {{have come to}} the fore of agricultural research and driven policy discussions regarding European agriculture. Indeed, numerous changes in the agricultural production chain such as increased globalization and liberalization, climatic changes and a growing awareness for environmental and animal welfare have made several types of risk increasingly important. A good understanding of farmers’ risk behavior is essential {{in order to be able}} to predict sectorial responses to these changes in risk conditions and to anticipate the outcome of risk-related policies. Risk balancing behavior constitutes one potential unanticipated risk response as it involves making strategic financial risk adjustments in response to changes in business risk levels. European evidence on risk balancing behavior, however, was lacking to date leaving EU-policy makers partly in the dark with regards to the full impact of risk-altering policy measures of the CAP—i. e., the existing <b>decoupled</b> <b>income</b> <b>support</b> and future risk management instruments currently considered in CAP reform discussions. Another area that is gaining increased attention in European agricultural {{risk analysis}} is the importance of farm household risk exposure and management. Given that farmers have a broad range of family-related goals and values and that EU farm households increasingly earn a large part of their household income from non-agricultural sources, agricultural risk behavior could be better understood by also considering risk exposure and risk constraints at the household level. Therefore, the possibility of the simultaneous adoption and potential correlation between different on-farm and off-farm responses needs to be acknowledged when looking at risk balancing behavior. The central research objective of this PhD dissertation is therefore to examine risk balancing behavior in European agriculture and acknowledging the role of the farm household. Chapter 2 presents a literature review that frames risk balancing research in the agricultural finance and decision making under risk literature and theoretically describes risk balancing behavior and the associated behavioral assumptions. Chapter 3 presents the first European evidence on risk balancing behavior using the rich EU- 15 FADN dataset for the period 1995 – 2008. By means of a correlation relationship analysis and several fixed effects regressions, the results reject evidence of strong-form risk balancing (trade-offs between financial risk and business risk keeping total risk constant) but cannot reject weak-form risk balancing (trade-offs between financial risk and business risk with some observed changes in total risk). While previous empirical studies focused on one production typology within one country, the results in this chapter disclose inter-country and inter-typology differences in risk balancing behavior. Using the Flanders (Belgium) FADN dataset for the period 2005 – 2012 complemented with survey data from 2013, it is further found that the observed risk balancing behavior might be driven by the risk averse proportion of farm operators. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first study to empirically validate that risk aversion is a prerequisite for risk balancing behavior. Chapter 4 discusses farm-level risk balancing measurement issues in greater detail and provides a deeper insight into the risk balancing behavior observed in Chapter 3. Risk balancing, in fact, involves two distinct risk responses depending on the direction of the strategic financial adjustment. When a farmer lowers financial risk in response to an increase in business risk, risk balancing entails a risk management strategy. Conversely, risk balancing behavior also involves an unanticipated entrepreneurship strategy where a farmer increases financial risk in response to lowered business risk conditions. To the best of my knowledge, this dissertation is the first study to explicitly consider both strategies and to empirically validate the occurrence of either strategy. Making use of correlation coefficients in the same EU- 15 FADN dataset from Chapter 3, risk balancing is mostly observed as a risk coping strategy for farmers (42 %) and to a lesser extent as an unanticipated risk response (26 %). In the latter case, I observed rather low incidence figures for the paradoxical situation where the financial risk response is greater than the business risk decline (dubbed ‘the paradox of risk balancing’ in literature) : only for 47 % of the entrepreneurship risk balancers (12 % of all risk balancers). By means of a multinomial Probit model, I further find that the determinants of a farmer’s choice to adopt either of both risk balancing strategies had opposite effects. These results clearly put risk balancing into a broader perspective and contrast the focus that is put on entrepreneurship risk balancing in literature. Chapter 5 of this dissertation theoretically extends the original Gabriel and Baker (1980) risk balancing framework to the household level. The novel concept of farm household risk balancing is introduced by means of a theoretical framework in which the farm household sets a constraint on the total household level risk and balances farm level and off-farm level risk. By taking farm household income and not just farm income as the focal point of the behavioral assumptions, a much wider variety of behavioral responses are considered in reaction to changes in the economic and policy environment. Besides altering the level of financial risk, farm households could just as well (i) attract off-farm income, (ii) smooth consumption levels, (iii) make off-farm investments or (iv) maintain liquidity buffers in response to exogenous changes in the level of business risk. Extensive empirical evidence from literature leading up to the model is presented and the implications for EU policy are discussed. Chapter 6 presents empirical evidence on Chapter 5 ’s novel household risk balancing framework using two distinct empirical approaches. First, based on 2013 survey information that complements the Flemish 2005 – 2012 FADN dataset, a psychometric household risk balancing scale is constructed. The results suggest that the average Flemish farm household exhibits household risk balancing behavior based on four underlying factors: (i) making decisions by the family as a whole, (ii) cutting private consumption in response to setbacks in business performance, (iii) mixing personal and business bank accounts to cover expenses and (iv) the necessity of off-farm income. Second, a system of equations was econometrically estimated using the Swiss 2003 – 2012 FADN dataset analyzing a farm household’s joint decision of the level of debt, off-farm income and consumption. The evidence supports the notion that farm households make strategic farm and off-farm decisions in response to exogenous changes in expected business risk. Both approaches demonstrate that part of the behavioral risk response of farm households is ignored when focusing solely on the farm-level in the original risk balancing framework and thus illustrate the relevance of the extended household risk balancing framework from Chapter 5. In summary, the findings of this dissertation provide a broader picture of risk balancing behavior in European agriculture. As the results reject evidence of strong-form risk balancing but cannot reject weak-form risk balancing, the balancing effect might not be as strong as the theoretical risk balancing models put forward. The extent of the balancing effect is further found to differ between countries and typologies and risk aversion is empirically validated as a necessary prerequisite for risk balancing behavior. Focusing on the direction of the balancing behavior, it is mostly observed as a risk coping strategy (risk management risk balancing) for farmers and to a lesser extent as an unanticipated risk response (entrepreneurship risk balancing). Accordingly, rather low incidence figures for the ‘Paradox of risk balancing’ are observed, which contrasts the focus that is put on this unanticipated behavioral response in the risk balancing literature. By extending the original risk balancing framework to the household level, this dissertation considers a much wider variety of behavioral responses in reaction to risk changes in the economic and policy environment. The empirical results suggest the incidence of household risk balancing behavior in two case study regions (Flanders and Switzerland). nrpages: 164 status: publishe...|$|E
