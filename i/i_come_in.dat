25|$|The {{original}} title is Dark Angel; {{the film was}} planned to be released under the same title in the United States (which had the latest release) but was renamed by Triumph Releasing to <b>I</b> <b>Come</b> <b>in</b> Peace because of two other movies entitled The Dark Angel (from 1925 and 1935), according to executive producer Mark Damon (in a 1993 interview with UK magazine Impact), who preferred the {{original title}}.|$|E

500|$|Cox {{benefited from}} co-creating Confessions, {{as well as}} from the success of [...] "Burn". He had {{previously}} contributed to records for Alicia Keys, B2K, Mariah Carey and Destiny's Child, but he felt 2004 introduced him to another landscape in the music industry. His contribution to this song elevated him to fame, and garnered more attention for his past work. [...] "Burn" [...] earned him two Grammy nominations. Cox said, [...] "Everybody who does this for a living, dreams about being nominated. It's the ultimate accomplishment. I've always been the silent guy — <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>in,</b> do my job and head out. I like to leave all the glory and shine to others, but this is the validation that means the most to me. It also makes me want to work harder to get that same recognition again." ...|$|E
500|$|Cisneros {{explores the}} issue of place in {{relation}} not only to gender but also to class. As Saldívar has noted, [...] "Aside from the personal requirement of a gendered woman's space, Esperanza recognizes the collective requirements of the working poor and the homeless as well." [...] He refers to Esperanza's determination not to forget her working-class roots once she obtains her dream house, and to open her doors {{to those who are}} less fortunate. Esperanza says [...] "Passing bums will ask, Can <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>in?</b> I'll offer them the attic, ask them to stay, because I know how it is to be without a house." [...] According to Saldívar, this statement of Esperanza's alludes to [...] "the necessity for a decent living space" [...] that is fundamental to all people, despite the different oppressions they face.|$|E
500|$|In 1990, Lundgren {{starred in}} Craig R. Baxley's sci-fi thriller <b>I</b> <b>Come</b> <b>in</b> Peace (also known as Dark Angel) {{opposite}} Brian Benben, Betsy Brantley, Matthias Hues and Jay Bilas. Lundgren plays Jack Caine, a tough Houston cop with an inner sensitivity, {{who does not}} let the rules of police procedure prevent him pursuing his mission {{to wipe out the}} White Boys, a gang of white collar drug dealers who killed his partner while he was waylaid stopping a convenience store robbery. Lundgren said of his role, [...] "What attracted me to Dark Angel is that I get {{to do more than just}} action. There's some romance, some comedy, some drama. I actually have some clever dialogue in this one. I get to act. One author said [...] "Universe (1987) or Dark Angel (1990), demonstrates that nature and his [...] hairdresser have suited him perfectly to Nazi genetically engineered baddie roles." ...|$|E

500|$|Friendship 7 safely splashed down [...] {{southeast}} of Cape Canaveral after Glenn's 4-hour, 55-minute flight. He carried {{a note on}} the flight which read, [...] "I am a stranger. <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> peace. Take me to your leader {{and there will be a}} massive reward for you in eternity" [...] in several languages, in case he landed near southern Pacific Ocean islands. The original procedure called for Glenn to exit through the top hatch, but he was uncomfortably warm and decided that egress through the side hatch would be faster. During the flight, he endured 7.8 G's of acceleration and traveled [...] at about [...] The flight took Glenn to a maximum altitude (apogee) of about [...] and a minimum altitude of [...] (perigee) at a speed of about [...] The flight made Glenn the first American to orbit the Earth, the third American in space, and the fifth human in space. The mission, which Glenn called [...] "best day of his life", renewed U.S. confidence. His flight occurred while the U.S. and the Soviet Union were embroiled in the Cold War and competing in the Space Race.|$|E
500|$|Cherry {{offered the}} role of Bree Van de Kamp, a [...] "perfect homemaker" [...] {{reminiscent}} of The Stepford Wives, to Dana Delany three times. Delany rejected the role, as it was too similar to her character on Pasadena, but would later join the series in its fourth season as Katherine Mayfair. Marcia Cross was later cast as Bree. Roma Downey, Jeri Ryan, and Stacey Travis were also considered for the role, while Nicollette Sheridan auditioned for the part and was cast as neighborhood tramp Edie Britt instead. On her audition, Sheridan recalled, [...] "At {{the end of the}} reading, the director looked at me and said, 'No, no, I see you as Edie.' I said, 'Oh, I see, <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> a housewife and mother of two and leave the slut.'" [...] The Edie character was originally intended to be a small role, but it was expanded once Sheridan was cast. Felicity Huffman was cast as Lynette Scavo, a frustrated stay-at-home mother of four, after talking about her own experiences as a mother during her audition. Cherry called Huffman's casting [...] "very lucky," [...] commenting that [...] "within fifteen minutes she had the part." [...] Alex Kingston read for {{the role of}} Lynette, and has since alleged that she was denied the role for being too heavy. The role of series narrator Mary Alice Young was given to Sheryl Lee. Cross originally auditioned for the role before being cast as Bree instead. Jeanne Tripplehorn and Heather Locklear also auditioned for leading roles.|$|E
2500|$|In a 1976 Rolling Stone interview, Young {{gives an}} insight into working with the Vanda/Young team: After I {{recorded}} Pasadena our relationship just developed. [...] They play me their songs and say: [...] "See {{what you think of}} this." [...] Usually I like it, sometimes I don't. [...] Sometimes I pick out something they've written and say [...] "I want to do this", like I did with Things to do. (For the JPY album), we worked out some of the songs on the road. [...] Others are worked out in the studio and some, like Standing in the Rain are produced by the studio system. [...] Harry and George work it out and <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> later to do the vocal.|$|E

2500|$|Guitarist and vocalist Daniel Rossen, {{a friend}} of Bear's from jazz-camp, joined the band soon after. Rossen stated, [...] "For a long time, I only played my songs to close friends; and it just {{happened}} that I lived with Chris Taylor during my second year of college, so he heard them. He was my entrance into Grizzly Bear. He joined the band first, then {{after a while he}} suggested <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>in</b> with these songs. [...] When I joined, I did about two rehearsals with them, worked out one of my songs to put into the set, then a week later we were out on the road for a two-month tour. It was a real trial-by-fire thing. I was close with Chris and Chris , but I didn’t know Ed [...] at all; it was weird getting to know a stranger by spending all day in the same car." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rotten Tomatoes, {{a review}} aggregator, reports that 13% of 15 {{surveyed}} critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 3.6/10. [...] Contemporary reviews were generally negative. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times called it [...] "stale through and through, derived from countless cop-buddy formula thrillers, drenched in violence and devoid {{of so much}} as a whiff of real life." [...] Caryn James of The New York Times wrote, [...] "This story turns out to be much more mundane than its outrageously clever premise." [...] Dave Kehr of the Chicago Tribune wrote that the film's imaginative weapons and humor make it an entertaining crowd-pleaser but criticized its cynical violence and lack of moral consciousness. [...] Richard Harrington of The Washington Post compared it to Hardware and said its influences are more subtle, though it suffers from using too much humor. [...] Chris Hicks of the Deseret News wrote that the film [...] "isn't as bad as it has every right to be" [...] and [...] "provides some fun for fans of the genre". Lou Cedrone of The Baltimore Sun wrote, [...] "Apart from the gore, <b>I</b> <b>Come</b> <b>in</b> Peace is an amusing mixture of action, science-fiction and comedy." [...] Gary Thompson of the Philadelphia Daily News said that it is a better than usual rip-off of The Terminator with some original ideas. [...] Time Out London wrote, [...] "With an upbeat script and a healthy sense of humour, this is an unashamedly ridiculous affair with moderate ambitions and matching success." ...|$|E
