50|$|Lift {{irrigation}} schemes must accomplish two main tasks: first, to carry water {{by means of}} pumps from the water source to the main <b>delivery</b> <b>chamber,</b> which is situated at the top most point in the command area. Second. they must distribute this water {{to the field of}} the beneficiary farmers by means of a suitable and proper distribution.|$|E
50|$|Of {{these two}} issues, {{distribution}} {{is the most}} complex, for several reasons. First, whereas the system for collecting water at the main <b>delivery</b> <b>chamber</b> makes use of pumps, the distribution system is typically completely gravity-based, {{and have to be}} designed {{solely on the basis of}} the available hydraulic head. In addition, the area to be irrigated is scattered and has varying topography, and each farm is of a different size, so it can be a challenge to design a gravity-based system that allots each farmer a fair amount of water. Several mechanisms have been developed to meet these challenges.|$|E

40|$|Study objectives: The aim of {{our study}} was to {{determine}} the in vitro delivery of salbutamol from a pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) containing hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) propellant through various delivery devices to four models of a pediatric lung. Design: To determine the effect of electrostatic charge, delivery of salbutamol was initially assessed with a multistage liquid impinger (MSLI) through an inline nonchamber device (Baxter MDI Adapter) and a small (Aerochamber MV) and a large (Nebuhaler) inline chamber device. Following this, the delivery was assessed to four lung models appropriate for a child of 70 kg, 50 kg, 15 kg, and 4 kg, with the same three reduced static devices inserted directly into a pediatric ventilator circuit. Measurements and results: Reduction of electrostatic charge improved small particle <b>delivery</b> through holding <b>chambers</b> to the MSLI by 12 to 14 %. In the ventilator model, the mean delivery was between 1. 9 % and 5. 4 % for the nonchamber device, between 14. 3 % and 27. 2 % for the small holding chamber, and between 7. 2 % and 25. 7 % for the large holding <b>chamber.</b> <b>Delivery</b> was the least efficient in the 4 -kg model compared to the 70 -kg, 50 -kg, and 15 -kg models.

The water requirement for each block is determined, and pipe lines are designed for these blocks depending on the available head and required discharge. Field delivery chambers are then constructed on the distribution pipe lines, and valves are fitted to control {{the flow of the}} pipe lines, with flow from the main <b>delivery</b> <b>chamber</b> controlled by these valves. In this system, lines for lower fields have more discharge, because the force of gravity is greater, so water distribution can be unequal.|$|E

40|$|In {{the process}} of {{multiple}} injections, the influence of different injections makes the controlling of cycle fuel injection quantity more difficult. The high pressure common rail (HPCR) simulation model is established in AMESim environment.

40|$|Background and purpose: In {{lung cancer}} patients, the {{accuracy}} of dose calculation by radiotherapy treatment planning systems may be reduced {{by the presence of}} tissue inhomogeneities. Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) and Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) commonly include the use of small field segments which can exacerbate these issues. A multicentre dosimetry audit was undertaken to verify {{the accuracy of}} treatment delivery at participating centres. Materials and methods: An inhomogeneous phantom with regions of lung equivalent materials was used. The audit consisted of two parts: basic beam model tests and clinical trial plan measurements. An ArcCheck diode array was used to measure fluences from the treatment <b>delivery.</b> Ion <b>chamber</b> and film planar dose readings near the interface were acquired. Results: Nine centres were visited, with a total of eleven distinct combinations of planning and delivery system. Significant differences were found in ion chamber dose measurements in basic beam model tests between treatment planning system algorithms. For the clinical trial plan test, gamma analysis of the entry and exit dose fluence showed good agreement, with mean pass rates of 97. 2 % (95 % CI: 95. 3 – 99. 1) and 99. 0 % (95 % CI: 98. 3 – 99. 7) for tolerances of 3 %/ 2  mm and 3 %/ 3  mm respectively. No {{significant differences were found between}} treatment planning system algorithms, delivery techniques and linac manufacturers. Conclusion: This multi-centre dosimetry audit of complex IMRT/VMAT delivery provides confidence in the accuracy of modern planning and delivery systems in inhomogeneous tissues.

40|$|Abstract- High {{pressure}} {{common rail}} (HPCR) {{fuel injection system}} is the main development trend for fuel injection system of diesel engine. Precise controlling of injection pressure and multiple injections are the advantages and key features of the HPCR system. Affect of pilot injection quantity (PIQ) and pilot-main interval (PMI) on main injection quantity fluctuation (MIQF) has been investigated in this paper by evaluating performance coherence and stability of injection quantity of diesel engine. A numerical model of HPCR system has been development in AMESim environment. Predicting accuracy of the numerical model has been validated by comparing its results with experimental data. The {{results show that the}} pilot injection triggers pressure cyclical fluctuation in the electro-injection <b>delivery</b> <b>chamber</b> and gives rise to MIQF. Amplitude of MIQF decreases with increase of PMI and increase with increase of PIQ. Moreover, variation of PIQ has also influence on both the amplitude and the phase of MIQF. Influence of MIQ on amplitude of MIQF depends on how many pressure fluctuation cycles have been incorporated in the main injection...|$|E
40|$|Background：Atrial {{fibrillation}} (Af) after open {{heart surgery}} {{may result in}} hypotension, heart failure, embolic complication and prolongation in length of hospital stay. Several studies have investigated the efficacy of pharmacological prophylaxis in reducing the incidence of Af after cardiac surgery. The pericardial sac represents a natural physical barrier and provides a drug receptacle to restrict drug delivery to the heart. The overall objective {{of this study was}} to determine whether the pericardial sac could function as a <b>delivery</b> <b>chamber</b> for antiarrhythmic drugs. We investigated whether quinidine delivered into the pericardial sac exerted an effect on atrial and ventricular refractoriness, impulse generation, and conduction. Methods：All animals were anesthetized with α-chloralose. After a sternotomy, the pericardium was opened and cradled to produce a “container ” of approximately 30 ml. Experimental animals received quinidine, 3. 33 mg/ml, dissolved in Krebs-Henseleit solution instilled into their pericardial sacs for 30 minutes. Baseline and 5, 10 and 30 minutes postinstillation electrophysiologic studies were performed. Plasma quinidine levels were measured at each of the time intervals in three different sites i. e., right ventricle (RV), aortic root and femoral vein (FV). Results：Baseline systolic (SAP) and diastolic aortic pressure (DAP) were 148 ± 16. 8 mmHg, and 111 ± 23. 9 mmHg, respectively.

40|$|Fabry-Perot {{optical fibre}} sensors {{have been used}} {{extensively}} for measuring a variety of parameters such as strain, temperature, pressure and vibration. Conventional extrinsic fibre Fabry-Perot sensors are associated with problems such as calibration of the gauge length of each individual sensor, their relatively large size compared to the diameter of optical fibre and a manual manufacturing method that leads to poor reproducibility. Therefore, new designs and fabrication techniques for producing fibre Fabry-Perot sensors are required {{to address the problems}} of extrinsic fibre Fabry-Perot sensors. This thesis investigates hydrofluoric acid etching and F 2 -laser micro-machining of optical fibres to produce intrinsic Fabry-Perot cavities. Chemical etching of single mode fused silica fibres produced cavities across the core of the fibres due to preferential etching of the doped-region. Scanning electron microscope, interferometric surface profiler and CCD spectrometer studies showed that the optical quality of the etched cavities was adequate to produce Fabry-Perot interference. Controlled fusion splicing of etched fibres produced intrinsic Fabry-Perot cavities. These sensors were surface-mounted on composite coupons and their response to applied strain was studied using low coherence interferometry. These sensors showed linear and repeatable response with the strain measured by the electrical resistance strain gauges. To carry out F 2 -laser micro-machining of fused silica and sapphire substrates, a micro-machining station was designed and constructed. This involved the design of illumination optics for 157 nm laser beam delivery, the design and construction of beam <b>delivery</b> <b>chamber,</b> target alignment and monitoring systems. Ablation of fused silica and sapphire disks was carried out to determine ablation parameters suitable for micro-machining high aspect ratio microstructures that have adequate optical quality to produce Fabry-Perot interference. Cavities were micro-machined through the diameter of SMF 28 and SM 800 fibres at different energy densities. CCD interrogation of these intrinsic fibre cavities ablated at an energy density of 25 x 10 4 Jm - 2 produced Fabry-Perot interference fringes. The feasibility of micro-machining high aspect ratio cavities at the cleaved end-face of the fused silica fibres and through the diameter of sapphire fibres was demonstrated. A technique based on in-situ laser-induced fluorescence monitoring was developed to determine the alignment of optical fibres and ablation depth during ablation through the fibre diameter. Ablation of cavities through the diameter of fibre Bragg gratings showed that the heat-generated inside the cavity during ablation had no effect on the peak reflection and the integrity of core and cladding of the fibre. Finally, a pH-sensor, a chemical sensor based on multiple cavities ablated in multimode fibres and a feasible design for pressure sensor fabrication based on ablated cavity in a single mode fibre were demonstrated.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, a {{theoretical}} and computational investigation is {{conducted to examine}} {{the performance of a}} fuel injection system fitted with a constant pressure valve, used to power a high speed direct injection (DI) diesel engine. The delivery valve (conventional layout) in the fuel injection system of diesel engines is used to provide a residual pressure in the fuel pipeline for the next injection. However, this layout often results in secondary injections which have a serious effect on engine performance. This problem is more severe in the cases of maintaining high residual pressure values. The use of a secondary valve placed inside the delivery valve, called the constant pressure valve, eliminates this problem by relieving the fuel pipe from the high pressure fluctuations caused by the pressure waves reflected at the injector end and the <b>delivery</b> valve <b>chamber.</b> A relevant experimental investigation is conducted with such a fuel injection system on a high speed direct injection diesel engine, examining the effect of load and speed on the performance of the fuel injection system. The experimental results compare well with the theoretical results obtained from a comprehensive simulation model developed by the present authors. Also, results are presented using the simulation model for the same fuel injection system without being fitted with the constant pressure valve, revealing the occurrence of secondary injections at a high engine speed. The simulation model offers very useful information concerning the design of such a fuel injection system and may be used during the development procedure providing economy in time and {{a better understanding of the}} entire injection process...|$|R

It is dedicated for treating multiple brain metastases with radiosurgery on linear accelerators (linacs) using a single-setup isocenter with noncoplanar dynamic conformal arcs. This {{study is to}} validate the calculated absolute dose and dose distribution of ABMP. Three types of measurements were performed to validate the planning software: 1, dual micro ion chambers were used with an acrylic phantom to measure the absolute dose; 2, a 3 D cylindrical phantom with dual diode array {{was used to evaluate}} 2 D dose distribution and point dose for smaller targets; and 3, a 3 D pseudo-in vivo patient-specific phantom filled with polymer gels was used to evaluate the accuracy of 3 D dose distribution and radia-tion <b>delivery.</b> Micro <b>chamber</b> measurement of two targets (volumes of 1. 2 cc and 0. 9 cc, respectively) showed that the percentage differences of the absolute dose at both targets were less than 1 %. Averaged GI passing rate of five different plans measured with the diode array phantom was above 98 %, using criteria of 3 % dose difference, 1 mm distance to agreement (DTA), and 10 % low-dose threshold. 3 D gel phantom measurement results demonstrated a 3 D displacement of nine targets of 0. 7 ± 0. 4 mm (range 0. 2 ~ 1. 1 mm). The averaged two-dimensional (2 D) GI passing rate for several region of interests (ROI) on axial slices that encompass each one of the nine targets was above 98 % (5 % dose difference, 2 mm DTA, and 10 % low-dose threshold). Measured D 95, the minimum dose that covers 95 % of the target volume, of the nine targets was 0. 7 % less than the calculated D 95. Three different types of dosimetric verification methods were used and proved the dose calculation of the new automatic brain metastases planning (ABMP) software was clinical acceptable. The 3 D pseudo-in vivo patient-specific gel phantom test also served as an end-to-end test for validating not only the dose calculation, but the treatment delivery accuracy as well...|$|R
40|$|Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) is {{extensively}} {{used for}} cancer patients treatment in modern Radiotherapy Clinics. Patient-related Quality Control (QC) is {{essential part of}} IMRT clinical implementation, as fluencies of Intensity Modulated (IM) fields has to be independently verified prior to delivery of the IMRT plan to the patient. In most cases, combination or ionometric and film dosimetry is in use for patient-related QC. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate volume-averaging effect of different ionization chambers used for ionometric dosimetry of the IMRT fields. Examination of the response of three ionization chambers of different sensitive volumes was performed, using set of static and IM fields. Chambers were cross-calibrated in static field of size, sufficient to cover with homogeneous dose chamber with the largest sensitive volume. Dynamic IM fields with different dose gradients through chamber sensitive volume were designed. Fluencies of all IM test fields were verified by means of the film dosimetry. Measurements in the penumbra region of the static field were used to separate effects of dynamic dose <b>delivery</b> from the <b>chamber</b> averaging effect. Penumbra profile of the static field was acquired using all detectors under investigation. Differences in the chambers response larger than 8 % were found for measurements in high dose gradients both in penumbra of static field, and in gradient region of the dynamic IM field.

40|$|Abstract Background There {{have been}} many recent {{developments}} of in vitro cigarette smoke systems closely replicating in vivo exposures. The Borgwaldt RM 20 S smoking machine (RM 20 S) enables the serial dilution and delivery of cigarette smoke to exposure chambers for in vitro analyses. In this study we have demonstrated reliability and robustness testing of the RM 20 S in delivering smoke to in vitro cultures using an in-house designed whole smoke exposure chamber. Results The syringe precision and accuracy of smoke dose generated by the RM 20 S was assessed using a methane gas standard and resulted in a repeatability error of ≤ 9 %. Differential electrical mobility particle spectrometry (DMS) measured smoke particles generated from reference 3 R 4 F cigarettes at points along the RM 20 S. 53 % ± 5. 9 % of particles by mass reached the chamber, the remainder deposited in the syringe or connecting tubing and ~ 16 % deposited in the chamber. Spectrofluorometric quantification of particle deposition within chambers indicated {{a positive correlation between}} smoke concentration and particle deposition. In vitro air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures (H 292 lung epithelial cells), exposed to whole smoke (1 : 60 dilution (smoke:air, equivalent to ~ 5 μg/cm 2)) demonstrated uniform smoke <b>delivery</b> within the <b>chamber.</b> Conclusions These results suggest this smoke exposure system is a reliable and repeatable method of generating and exposing ALI in vitro cultures to cigarette smoke. This system will enable the evaluation of future tobacco products and individual components of cigarette smoke and may be used as an alternative in vitro tool for evaluating other aerosols and gaseous mixtures such as air pollutants, inhaled pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. </p...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: IAEA TRS‐ 398 {{provides}} {{recipes and}} formulas to compute ion recombination correction factors for continuous and pulsed broad proton beams. However, those formulas {{may not be}} optimal for pencil beam scanning modalities (PBS). This work aims at evaluating appropriately ion recombination correction for different ionization chamber types for PBS <b>delivery.</b> Methods: Ion <b>chamber</b> measurements were performed in a water phantom (BluePhantom 2, IBA Dosimetry GmbH) irradiated by a 10 × 10 cm 2 uniform field (2. 5 mm spot spacing, IBA PBS dedicated nozzle) for Extradin T 1, FC 65 ‐G, CC 01 and PPC 05 at different beam energies, beam current and polarizing voltages. The Boutillon formalism was used in order to separate the contributions from initial and general recombination. The recombination correction factor was computed using the two‐voltage method for continuous, pulsed, and pulsed‐scanned beams as well. Chamber‐dependent conditions such as depth and relative position to spot mapping were also evaluated. Results: The formulas for continuous beams in TRS‐ 398 lead to an underestimation of the correction factors (ks) of 0. 4 % compared to Boutillon analysis for EXTRADIN T 1. An overestimation of 0. 2 % is observed considering the beam as pulsed. For PPC 05 using the two‐voltage methods, (ks) difference of 0. 3 % is found compared to Boutillon's value. For FC 65 ‐G using the two‐voltage correction (ks) is 0. 4 % underestimated in continuous beam and can be 3 % overestimated using pulsed beam formula. (ks) values is computed for various depth positions, energies and beam currents. Plotting inverse ionizing charge versus inverse squared voltage shows that initial recombination is not negligible for Extradin T 1, FC 65 ‐G and PPC 05 at low residual range. Conclusion: We have determined recombination correction factors for 4 ion chambers using various practical and yet accurate methods in the specific case of PBS delivery. Significant differences in recombination correction factors can appear if recipes from IAEA TRS‐ 398 are applied blindly for proton PBS delivery...|$|R
40|$|Background: Prostate {{cancer is}} the most common male cancer in the Western world. The most {{substantial}} long term morbidity from this cancer is sexual dysfunction with consequent adverse changes in couple and intimate relationships. Research to date has not identified an effective way to improve sexual and psychosocial adjustment for both men with prostate cancer and their partners. As well, the efficacy and cost effectiveness of peer counselling as opposed to professional models of service delivery has not yet been empirically tested. This paper presents the design of a three arm randomised controlled trial (peer vs. nurse counselling vs. usual care) that will evaluate the efficacy of two couples-based sexuality interventions (ProsCan for Couples: Peer support vs. nurse counselling) on men's and women's sexual and psychosocial adjustment after surgical treatment for localised prostate cancer; in addition to cost-effectiveness. Methods/design: Seventy couples per condition (210 couples in total) will be recruited after diagnosis and before treatment through urology private practices and hospital outpatient clinics and randomised to (1) usual care; (2) eight sessions of peer-delivered telephone support with DVD education; and (3) eight sessions of oncology nurse-delivered telephone counselling with DVD education. Two intervention sessions will be delivered before surgery and six over the six months post-surgery. The intervention will utilise a cognitive behavioural approach along with couple relationship education focussed on relationship enhancement and helping the couple to conjointly manage the stresses of cancer diagnosis and treatment. Participants will be assessed at baseline (before surgery) and 3, 6 and 12 months post-surgery. Outcome measures include: Sexual adjustment; unmet sexuality supportive care needs; attitudes to sexual help seeking; psychological adjustment; benefit finding and quality of life. Discussion: The study will provide recommendations about the efficacy of peer support vs. nurse counselling to facilitate better sexual and couple adjustment after prostate cancer as well as recommendations on whether the interventions represent efficient health service <b>delivery.</b> 頲 008 <b>Chambers</b> et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.
