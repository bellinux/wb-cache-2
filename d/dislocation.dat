5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, Friedrich was rediscovered by the Norwegian art {{historian}} Andreas Aubert (1851–1913), whose writing initiated modern Friedrich scholarship, and by the Symbolist painters, who valued his visionary and allegorical landscapes. The Norwegian Symbolist Edvard Munch (1863–1944) would have seen Friedrich's work during a visit to Berlin in the 1880s. Munch's 1899 print The Lonely Ones echoes Friedrich's Rückenfigur (back figure), although in Munch's work the focus has shifted away from the broad landscape and toward the sense of <b>dislocation</b> between the two melancholy figures in the foreground.|$|E

The inaccurate AMNH mount inspired similar depictions in many films and paintings (such as Rudolph Zallinger's famous mural The Age of Reptiles in Yale University's Peabody Museum of Natural History) until the 1990s, when films such as Jurassic Park introduced a more accurate posture to the general public.|$|E

40|$|Whether a {{stressed}} material fractures by brittle cleavage or ductile rupture {{is determined}} by ist ability to onvert elastic strain energy to plastic deformation through the generation and motion of <b>dislocations.</b> Although {{it is known that}} pre-existing <b>dislocations</b> {{play a crucial role in}} crack tip plasticity, the involved mechanisms are unclear. Here it is demonstrated by atomistic simulations that individual pre-existing <b>dislocations</b> may lead to the generation of large numbers of <b>dislocations</b> at the crack tip. The newly generated <b>dislocations</b> are usually of different types. The processes involved are fundamentally different for stationary cracks and propagating cracks. Whereas local crack front reorientation plays an important role in propagating cracks, the multiplication mechanism at stationary cracks is connected with cross-slip in the highly inhomogeneous stress field of the crack. Analysis of the forces acting on the <b>dislocations</b> allows to determine which <b>dislocations</b> multiply and the slip systems they activate. These results provide the necessary physical link between pre-existing <b>dislocations</b> and the generation of <b>dislocations</b> at crack tips...|$|R
5|$|Voidites are {{octahedral}} nanometer-sized clusters {{present in}} many natural diamonds, as revealed by electron microscopy. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that annealing of type-IaB diamond at high temperatures and pressures (>2600 °C) results in break-up of the platelets and formation of <b>dislocation</b> loops and voidites, i.e. that voidites {{are a result}} of thermal degradation of platelets. Contrary to platelets, voidites do contain much nitrogen, in the molecular form.|$|E
25|$|The {{volumetric}} {{activation energy}} {{indicates that the}} rate of Harper–Dorn creep is controlled by vacancy diffusion to and from dislocations, resulting in climb-controlled <b>dislocation</b> motion. Unlike in other creep mechanisms, the <b>dislocation</b> density here is constant and independent of the applied stress. Moreover, the <b>dislocation</b> density must be low for Harper–Dorn creep to dominate. The density has been proposed to increase as dislocations move via cross-slip from one slip-plane to another, thereby increasing the <b>dislocation</b> length per unit volume. Cross-slip can also result in jogs {{along the length of the}} <b>dislocation,</b> which, if large enough, can act as single-ended <b>dislocation</b> sources.|$|E
25|$|For <b>dislocation</b> creep, Q = Q(self diffusion), m = 4–6, and b = 0. Therefore, <b>dislocation</b> creep has {{a strong}} {{dependence}} on the applied stress and the intrinsic activation energy, but no grain size dependence.|$|E

When a shoulder dislocates frequently, the condition is referred to as shoulder instability.

25|$|Harper–Dorn creep is a climb-controlled <b>dislocation</b> {{mechanism}} at low {{stresses that}} has been observed in aluminum, lead, and tin systems, in addition to nonmetal systems such as ceramics and ice. It is characterized by two principal phenomena: a linear relationship between the steady-state strain rate and applied stress at a constant temperature, and an independent relationship between the steady-state strain rate and grain size for a provided temperature and applied stress. The latter observation implies that Harper–Dorn creep is controlled by <b>dislocation</b> movement; namely, since creep can occur by vacancy diffusion (Nabarro–Herring creep, Coble creep), grain boundary sliding, and/or <b>dislocation</b> movement, and since the first two mechanisms are grain-size dependent, Harper–Dorn creep must therefore be dislocation-motion dependent.|$|E
