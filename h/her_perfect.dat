Bianka Panova became the first rhythmic gymnast to make a clean sweep of all five individual events at a World Championship by attaining full marks.

25|$|As {{preparation}} for the clay court season (and to ensure her eligibility for the 2016 Summer Olympics), Williams travelled to Brindisi, Italy, to face Italy's team for {{a place in the}} Fed Cup's World Group. Williams lost the decisive doubles match alongside Alison Riske to Sara Errani and Flavia Pennetta, and as a result the United States team were relegated to World Group II. It was Williams's first loss in the Fed Cup. However, she maintained <b>her</b> <b>perfect</b> record in singles by defeating Camila Giorgi and Errani. The week of April 20 marked Serena's 114th consecutive week ranked world No. 1, the third-longest run in WTA history, behind Steffi Graf's 186 weeks and Martina Navratilova's 156. Williams suffered her first defeat of the season in the semifinals of the Mutua Madrid Open to world No. 4 Petra Kvitová. This loss ended a 27-match winning streak for Williams as well as a 50-match winning streak at Premier Mandatory events, and also a 19-match winning streak at the particular event. Williams played one match at the 2015 Internazionali BNL d'Italia before withdrawing from the tournament with an elbow injury. By virtue of having defeated Victoria Azarenka in the third round of the French Open, Williams became the first woman in the Open Era to win 50 matches at all four of the Grand Slams. Williams then defeated Sloane Stephens to reach her 40th Grand Slam singles quarterfinal. Serena won her next match easily, but had to come back from a set down in the semifinals versus Timea Bacsinszky for the fourth time in five matches to reach the final. She would go on to defeat Lucie Šafářová from the Czech Republic in three sets to win her 3rd French Open and 20th Grand Slam singles title. The win made her only the third person in history to win each Grand Slam at least three times, joining Margaret Court and Steffi Graf. She's the first player to win three straight Grand Slams since she did it herself during the Serena Slam. She also became the first player to win the Australian-French Open double since Jennifer Capriati in 2001.|$|E

500|$|Author Rikky Rooksby {{wrote in}} his book The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna that Madonna's singing in the song [...] "deserved a {{commendation}} for bravery and {{was a sign that}} she was going to set herself challenges." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic, while reviewing Like a Virgin, wrote that the cover of the song was [...] "well worth hearing". Debbie Bull from Rolling Stone, meanwhile, opined that [...] "her torchy ballad 'Love Don't Live Here Anymore' is awful." [...] Larry Flick from Billboard complimented both the versions of the song, calling the first version [...] "a lush slice of symphonic pop", and the other an [...] "old-school, jeep-soul cruiser. Both arrangements perfectly suit her vocal, which is rife with emotional belts and theatrical gasps. [...] David Reitzas string-laden version will please those who never got enough of the previous single 'You'll See'. The bottom line is that this will likely be another smash for an artist whose stock as a credible musical entity deservedly rises with each release." [...] He also complimented the dance remixes of the song, saying that [...] "when combined, [...] keyboard lines add up to a very pastel, tea-dance ready twirler. His five mixes lean largely towards the middle of the club road." [...] Liz Smith, while reviewing the Something to Remember album in Newsday, felt that all of Madonna's vocal trainings that she received while shooting for the film Evita, had [...] "paid off, because the La M's second single sounds wonderful, and is a step up from the previous haunting 'You'll See'."
