40|$|AbstractWe used a {{mandible}} accelerometer to <b>document</b> <b>feeding</b> {{events in}} two free-ranging adult female Weddell seals in Atka Bay, Antarctica. Using spectral analysis, we isolated several {{patterns in the}} mandible acceleration data. The shorter, un-attenuated signals are thought to represent feeding. The longer, attenuating signals are thought to represent vocalizing activities. The depth data suggest that one seal dived under {{the base of the}} iceberg. During these dives we detected a unique type of feeding signal. These signals were characterized by patterns of low amplitude and irregular peaks. A second signal type, characterized by a larger amplitude, was observed 75 times at depths shallower than 60 m. The number of feeding signals per dive was higher for iceberg associated dives (> 60 m, 11. 3 signals/dive) than for dives to midwater depths (< 60 m, 0. 5 signals/dive). Our results support the hypothesis that underwater surface of icebergs serves as a habitat for marine fauna. We recorded the first vocalization related signals in seals using a mandible accelerometer. One seal spent significantly more time in shallow water and foraged less than the second seal. This seal also vocalized more often (135 events) than the second individual (29 events), possibly due to an emphasis on mating behavior...|$|E

40|$|Although dam removal {{has become}} an {{increasingly}} popular tool for river restoration, there is limited knowledge regarding the ecological effects of dam removal. The purpose of our study was to <b>document</b> <b>feeding</b> habits of coexisting brook charr, brown trout, and rainbow trout above and below a dam {{that is in the}} process of a staged removal. Modification of sediment transport caused by Stronach Dam since 1912 has affected stream channel configuration, fish habitat, and many other physical and biological processes. In order to document salmonine feeding habits above and below the dam, we selected zones to represent downstream conditions and areas of river upstream of the dam that encompassed the original reservoir and a stretch of river further upstream that was not hydraulically influenced by the dam. Because physical habitat largely governs aquatic community composition in streams, we expected these effects to be reflected in the fish and macroinvertebrate communities. In particular, we expected limited prey availability and salmonine feeding in the impacted upstream and downstream zones characterized by fine substrate composition and greater macroinvertebrate diversity and salmonine feeding opportunities in the non-impacted zone characterized by coarse substrate. We also expected mean percent wet stomach content weights to be higher downstream, as other studies have documented an increase in piscivory on blocked migratory prey species downstream of dams. Contrary to expectations, the downstream zone of the river contained the highest abundance of drifting invertebrate taxa and, although differences in habitat occurred among the zones, the diversity of driftin...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} addressed {{questions related}} to the selective advantages of regional endothermy and its independent evolution among several fish groups. The chapters integrate laboratory and field physiological measurements to provide a better understanding ofthe evolution of regional endothermy and its importance as an adaptation to the pelagic environment. Studies on the swimming energetics of the eastern Pacific bonito (Sarda chiliensis) revealed that the bonito had a similar cost of transport to that of similar sized yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) and that the bonito had a significantly lower standard metabolic rate than tuna. Thermal studies on live slender tuna, Allothunnus fallai, {{were the first to}} document both red muscle (RM) and eye and brain endothermy for this species and establish regional endothermy as a synapomorphy of the Tribe Thunnini. Additional findings for A. fallai revealed this species to possess a brain heater, a thermogenic organ composed of portions of all four of the rectus muscles. These findings demonstrate that the use of a heater tissue to elevate cranial temperatures has evolved independently in at least three fish groups. Movement studies on the mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus) used acoustic telemetry to record the in-vivo stomach temperatures and depth distribution off the coast of Southern California. This work showed that the tracked makos remained in the upper 12 m of the water column during up to 80 % of the track period and that larger makos dove to greater depths. Stomach temperature data were recorded for all tracked makos (including young of the year), and these data were used to <b>document</b> <b>feeding</b> events in five of the seven tracking sessions. A study on the muscle morphology of three thresher shark species (common thresher, Alopias vulpinus, pelagic thresher, A. pelagicus, and bigeye thresher, A. superciliosus) revealed interspecific differences in the RM transverse position and distribution along the body. The common thresher is the only alopiid to possess a RM arrangement {{similar to that of the}} endothermic lamnid sharks, suggesting that this species is likely the only thresher to be capable of RM endothermy...|$|E
40|$|Three {{threatened}} black cockatoos {{inhabit the}} Jarrah Eucalyptus marginata-Marri Corymbia calophylla forest of southwestern Australia: Baudin's Cockatoo Calyptorhynchus baudinii, Carnaby's Cockatoo C. latirostris, and the Forest Red-tailed Black Cockatoo C. banksii naso (FRTBC). Their local ecology {{in relation to}} anthropogenic disturbance is poorly known, hampering conservation management. This study investigated their ecology at the Newmont Boddington Gold (NBG) mine, 130 km southeast of Perth, Western Australia, along the eastern margin of the Jarrah-Marri forest. To improve the scientific basis for conserving black cockatoos and their habitat at NBG, I aimed to: (1) describe {{the ecology of the}} three species at NBG, particularly group size, site occupancy, habitat use, and food plant use (including seasonal and interannual changes); (2) examine the effectiveness of ground-based hollow surveys, postfelling inspections of hollows, and behavioural observations for assessing black cockatoo breeding habitat; (3) assess the successional stage of the rehabilitated mine pits and characterise variation in the structure and floristics of pits, in order to identify features that might influence the availability of food resources for black cockatoos; (4) <b>document</b> <b>feeding</b> activity by black cockatoos within rehabilitated mine pits and any associations with structural or floristic features; (5) trial artificial nest hollows to support breeding on-site and compensate for the loss of natural hollows; (6) review the use of artificial nest hollows for black cockatoos to assess their value for mitigating natural hollow loss; and (7) investigate black cockatoo use of natural and artificial water sources at NBG and assess the potential for black cockatoo interactions with residue disposal areas. All three black cockatoos used remnant forest habitat as well as human-modified habitats such as mine-site rehabilitation, water sumps, farm paddocks, and pine plantations. Carnaby’s Cockatoos used the broadest range of habitats and fed on at least ten plant species at NBG. FRTBC showed similar group sizes and occupancy across seasons, suggesting year-round residency. In contrast, group size and occupancy changed across seasons for Carnaby’s Cockatoos, indicating migrating flocks as well as some birds present year-round. Few Baudin’s Cockatoos were observed in spring and summer, but they were more abundant during autumn and winter, which is when flocks migrate northwards. Three methods – ground-based surveys, post-felling inspections, and behavioural observations of black cockatoos – were used to describe the availability of potentially suitable nesting hollows across three tree species (Jarrah, Marri, Wandoo E. wandoo) and to document probable nest sites. Eleven probable black cockatoo nest hollows were identified at NBG and surrounds (Carnaby’s Cockatoos: n = 7; FRTBC: n = 3; and unknown black cockatoo species: n = 1). Behavioural observations, using visual or acoustic cues followed by physical ‘tree-knocking’, were the most effective approach to identify probable nest hollows (n = 10 hollows). Ground-based surveys yielded only one probable nest hollow, while post-felling inspections identified none, despite large sample sizes and extensive field survey periods. Of the probable nest hollows, six were in Marri, four in Wandoo, and one in Jarrah. Ground-based surveys identified 149 potential hollow-bearing trees, of which 119 (80...|$|E

40|$|All {{breastfeeding}} infants {{lose some}} {{weight in the}} early days of life. Conventionally, 5 % to 7 % loss of birth weight has been accepted as the normal and expected amount of weight loss before infants begin to gain weight steadily. When infants lose more than 7 % of their birth weight, breastfeeding adequacy is sometimes questioned and formula supplementation is often given. Despite the fact that 5 % to 7 % is well known and commonly cited, little reliable evidence exists that supports use of this figure as a guide to practice. A systematic review of studies that focused on infant weight loss was conducted. The main objective was to determine the mean amount of weight loss for healthy, full-term exclusively breastfed infants after birth. One previous review and 9 primary studies published since 2008 were examined. The reported mean infant weight loss ranged widely among studies from 3. 79 % to 8. 6 %. The point at which most infants have lost the most amount of weight occurs 2 to 4 days after birth. Close examination of the studies, however, revealed significant methodological flaws in the research.

40|$|Maternal diets {{have been}} shown to affect fetal {{development}} and postnatal health. However, their effects on early preimplantation embryo remain less <b>documented.</b> <b>Feeding</b> rabbit females with hyperlipidic (8 %), hypercholesterolemic (0. 2 %) diet (HH diet) from 10 weeks of age resulted in intrauterine growth retardation of the progeny as soon as day 9 post fertilization. 1 We thus wondered whether early embryo was affected by this maternal diet. Therefore, we compared the transcriptome of embryos developed in HH-fed females with that of their control (C) counterparts at the stage just following the onset of embryonic genome activation (16 – 20 cell stage). Our transcriptome analyses evidenced the overexpression of ADIPOPHILIN in HH embryos. ADIPOPHILIN encodes for a protein involved in the early steps of lipid droplets formation from the endoplasmic reticulum. Its overexpression at embryonic genome activation stage was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR analyses. It seems to be transient as transcript quantification at the blastocyst stage did not detect significant differences between HH and C embryos. However, very interestingly, immuno- cytochemical analysis of ADIPOPHILIN localization at the blastocyst stage showed that ADIPOPHILIN colocalized with Nile Red-stained lipid droplets in the cytoplasm of trophoblast cells in HH embryos. Such lipid droplets accumulation was not found in control embryos. Later on, during gestation, HH conceptuses displayed similar lipid droplets in the labyrinthine zone of their placenta, whereas C conceptuses did not. Thus, our results evidenced that embryo gene expression may be sensitive to maternal diet as early as embryonic genome activation stage, and gene deregulation may be involved in early perturbation of extraembryonic tissues that persists during pregnancy...|$|R

Their local ecology {{in relation to}} anthropogenic disturbance is poorly known, hampering effective conservation management. Therefore we studied their group size, site occupancy patterns, habitat use, and food plants at a mine-site and its surrounds in the eastern forest over three years. FRTBC showed similar group sizes and occupancy across seasons, suggesting year-round residency and no marked seasonality in movements and grouping patterns. In contrast, Carnaby's Cockatoos were up to twice as abundant in spring and summer, indicating migrating or transient flocks and some year-round residents. Few Baudin's Cockatoos were present in summer, but their abundance increased at other times. All three cockatoos were observed in modified or humanmade habitats such as mine-site rehabilitation, farm paddocks, and pine plantations. Carnaby's Cockatoos used the broadest habitat range. We <b>documented</b> <b>feeding</b> on 16 plant species, with Carnaby's Cockatoos eating at least 10. Examination of feeding residues as well as observations of behaviour were essential to obtain a complete picture of feeding. Current mine-site rehabilitation protocols provide food for all three black cockatoos within a decade and should {{continue to do so}} long-term if Marri is maintained in the seed mix. However, because climate change scenarios predict declining rainfall over much of southwestern Australia, the plant species used to revegetate mine-sites and other landscapes may need to be reconsidered.
