5|$|The next {{batch of}} ballast motor cars were French-built gate stock cars, {{originally}} constructed in 1906, but converted {{in the early}} 1920s to run with the 1920 air-door stock. 20 motor cars were converted, but were replaced by more modern cars in 1930. Although 12 of the displaced cars were scrapped, six were kept as ballast motor cars, becoming numbers L24 to L29 in the service fleet. The final two were further converted to run as single cars on the Aldwych shuttle. During the Second World War they were used as pilot motor cars for refreshment trains on the Piccadilly line, which supplied food to people sleeping on the stations {{to escape from the}} bombing of the city. They returned to the Aldwych shuttle between 1946 and 1949, but were again used as pilot motor cars after that, transferring cars between the engineering works at Acton and various depots. They were both coupled to a <b>flat</b> <b>wagon</b> for a period, and were used to transfer stores from Acton Works to Northfields depot, and also took stores to Croxley Green and Queens Park depots on the Bakerloo line.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Flat</b> <b>wagons</b> (sometimes <b>flat</b> beds, flats or rail flats, US: flatcars), as {{classified}} by the International Union of Railways (UIC), are railway goods wagons {{that have a}} flat, usually full-length, deck (or 2 decks on car transporters) and little or no superstructure. By contrast, open wagons have high side and end walls and covered goods wagons have a fixed roof and sides. <b>Flat</b> <b>wagons</b> are often designed for the transportation of goods that are not weather-sensitive. Some <b>flat</b> <b>wagons</b> are able to be covered completely by tarpaulins or hoods and are therefore suitable for the transport of weather-sensitive goods. Unlike a [...] "goods wagon with opening roof", the loading area of a flat is entirely open and accessible once the cover is removed.|$|R
