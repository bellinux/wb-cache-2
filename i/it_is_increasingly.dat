5|$|Speaker's Corner became {{increasingly}} {{popular in the}} late 19th century. Visitors brought along placards, stepladders and soap boxes in order to stand out from others, while heckling of speakers was popular. Donald Soper, Baron Soper was a regular visitor throughout the 20th century, until just {{before his death in}} 1998. The rise of the Internet, particularly blogs, has diminished the importance of Speaker's Corner as a political platform, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>increasingly</b> seen as simply a tourist attraction.|$|E
5|$|Cats {{are ready}} to go to new homes at about 12 weeks of age, when they {{are ready to}} leave their mother. They can be surgically sterilized (spayed or castrated) as early as 7 weeks to limit {{unwanted}} reproduction. This surgery also prevents undesirable sex-related behavior, such as aggression, territory marking (spraying urine) in males and yowling (calling) in females. Traditionally, this surgery was performed at around six to nine months of age, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>increasingly</b> being performed prior to puberty, at about three to six months. In the US, about 80% of household cats are neutered.|$|E
5|$|South {{of where}} the Chile Rise intersects the Peru-Chile Trench, the trench disappears as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>increasingly</b> buried by sediments. However, {{subduction}} is still active {{as evidenced by the}} converging motion of the Antarctic Plate and the South America Plate and the volcanic activity. Only around 52° does the convergence change into strike-slip faulting at the Shackleton Fracture Zone. Subduction in that area commenced 17 million years ago, and the Antarctic slab has not sunk deep into the mantle. At shallow depth, magma generation is dominated by anatexis of the slab. The mantle ahead of the edge of the subducting slab may be dominated by a large slab window.|$|E

50|$|By {{the late}} 1630s, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>increasingly</b> common to find depictions of {{chocolate}} accouterments in still life paintings.|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>increasingly</b> {{realised}} by {{the professionals}} and academicians {{that the system}} of law teaching in India was thoroughly inadequate and unimaginative.|$|R
25|$|Kerosene {{is used as}} a diluent in the PUREX {{extraction}} process, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>increasingly</b> being {{supplanted by}} dodecane.|$|E
25|$|With {{the rise}} of single-page {{applications}} and JavaScript-heavy sites, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>increasingly</b> {{being used as a}} compile target for source-to-source compilers from both dynamic languages and static languages.|$|E
25|$|Hungarians do not {{commonly}} use second given {{names or}} what Americans call middle names, nor their corresponding initials. While <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>increasingly</b> frequent {{that they are}} given one, they tend to choose one they prefer to use.|$|E
5000|$|In the mid-1920s, posters {{had become}} a [...] "quintessential form of {{propaganda}}” in Likbez. Throughout the 1920s, though pro-literacy propaganda was still taking on its earlier forms, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>increasingly</b> contained in propaganda posters.|$|R
25|$|By mid February 2008 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>increasingly</b> {{clear that}} the {{outbreak}} had been successfully controlled and, on 28 February, the NSW Government declared victory against EI, lifting {{most of the remaining}} movement restrictions on horses.|$|R
50|$|Enflurane (2-chloro-1,1,2,-trifluoroethyl-difluoromethyl ether) is a {{halogenated}} ether. Developed by Ross Terrell in 1963, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{first used}} clinically in 1966. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>increasingly</b> used for inhalational anesthesia during the 1970s and 1980s but {{is no longer}} in common use.|$|R
25|$|Badolato near Soverato is a well-preserved medieval hilltop {{village with}} 13 churches. It was {{selected}} {{as one of the}} 1000 marvels of Italy to mark the anniversary of the unification of Italy. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>increasingly</b> popular with wealthy foreigners who have renovated the old houses.|$|E
25|$|Polystyrene is slow to {{biodegrade}} {{and is therefore}} a focus of controversy among environmentalists. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>increasingly</b> abundant {{as a form of}} litter in the outdoor environment, particularly along shores and waterways, especially in its foam form, and also in increasing quantities in the Pacific Ocean.|$|E
25|$|College hockey has a {{regional}} {{following in the}} northeastern and upper midwestern United States. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>increasingly</b> being used to develop players for the NHL and other professional leagues (the U.S. has junior leagues, the United States Hockey League and North American Hockey League, but they are more restricted to protect junior players' college eligibility). The Frozen Four is college hockey's national championship.|$|E
50|$|In the 16th {{century the}} Rocca was enlarged. From 1586 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>increasingly</b> {{used as a}} jail, which was active until 1865. After the 1702 earthquake, the edifice was {{partially}} rebuilt under design by Carlo Buratti.|$|R
50|$|The {{theory that}} Jamnia {{finalised}} the canon, first proposed by Heinrich Graetz in 1871, was popular {{for much of}} the 20th century. However, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>increasingly</b> questioned from the 1960s onward, and the theory has been largely discredited.|$|R
5000|$|In 1942 Juhl {{designed}} {{a house for}} himself, today known simply as Finn Juhl's House, and had it built with money inherited from his father. Over the years <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>increasingly</b> furnished with creations of his own design.|$|R
25|$|China {{has made}} {{impressive}} {{progress in the}} development and implementation of effective intervention strategies, especially since 2004. The country is currently in a transition stage in its HIV policy development. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>increasingly</b> adopting approaches that are based on scientific evidence and has encouraged the pilot testing of controversial methods of risk reduction (e.g., methadone maintenance treatment, needle exchange programmes, and the targeting of men who have sex with men and sex workers).|$|E
25|$|The public {{continue}} to externalize climate change to other people, places and times. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>increasingly</b> {{perceived as a}} major global issue with far-reaching consequences for future generations—45% say {{it is the most}} serious threat facing the World today and 53% believe it will impact significantly on future generations. However, the issue features less prominently nationally and locally, indeed only 9% believe climate change will have a significant impact upon them personally.|$|E
25|$|The {{two most}} common mtDNA tests are a {{sequence}} of HVR1 and HVR2 and a full sequence of the mitochondria. Some mtDNA tests may only analyze a partial range in these regions. Generally, testing only the HVRs has limited genealogical use so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>increasingly</b> popular and accessible {{to have a full}} sequence. The full sequence is still somewhat controversial because the coding region DNA may reveal medical information about the test-taker.|$|E
25|$|By early 1946, Curly's {{voice had}} {{become even more}} coarse than before, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>increasingly</b> {{difficult}} for him to remember even the simplest dialogue. He had lost a considerable amount of weight, and lines had creased his face.|$|R
50|$|The Garden Theatre {{presented}} {{a wide variety}} of dramas, musical comedies, and operas, both new plays and revivals, from 1890 to the approximately 1910, by which time <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>increasingly</b> used for extended, often lower-cost runs of plays first {{presented a}}t other theatres.|$|R
50|$|On {{the issue}} of remoteness, the judge's {{assessment}} was a good one, in that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>increasingly</b> likely as time passed that Economy Bag would want to squeeze Jackson's profit margins. To avoid further cost, that award (four years) would be restored.|$|R
25|$|It is {{used for}} {{motorcycle}} safety clothing, especially in the areas featuring padding such as shoulders and elbows. In fencing it {{is used in the}} protective jackets, breeches, plastrons and the bib of the masks. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>increasingly</b> being used in the peto, the padded covering which protects the picadors' horses in the bullring. Speedskaters also frequently wear an under-layer of Kevlar fabric to prevent potential wounds from skates {{in the event of a}} fall or collision.|$|E
25|$|It was {{formerly}} common in American English {{to use a}} diaeresis mark to indicate a hiatus: for example, coöperate, daïs, reëlect. The New Yorker and Technology Review magazines still use it for this purpose, even though <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>increasingly</b> rare in modern English. Nowadays the diaeresis is normally left out (cooperate), or a hyphen is used (co-operate) if the hiatus is between two morphemes in a compound word. It is, however, still common in monomorphemic loanwords such as naïve and Noël.|$|E
25|$|Like PET, SPECT {{also can}} be used to {{differentiate}} different kinds of disease processes which produce dementia, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>increasingly</b> used for this purpose. Neuro-PET has a disadvantage of requiring use of tracers with half-lives of at most 110 minutes, such as FDG. These must be made in a cyclotron, and are expensive or even unavailable if necessary transport times are prolonged more than a few half-lives. SPECT, however, is able to make use of tracers with much longer half-lives, such as technetium-99m, and as a result, is far more widely available.|$|E
50|$|At the Bangor Eisteddfod of 1874 Hen Wlad fy Nhadau gained further {{popularity}} when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> sung by Robert Rees ("Eos Morlais"), one of {{the leading}} Welsh soloists of his day. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>increasingly</b> sung at patriotic gatherings and gradually it developed into a national anthem.|$|R
50|$|The British {{were forced}} to tunnel into the {{buildings}} and, as Ceannt's numbers reduced, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>increasingly</b> involved in close quarter fighting. His unit saw intense fighting at times during the week, but surrendered when ordered {{to do so by}} his superior officer Patrick Pearse.|$|R

25|$|Terracaching.com {{seeks to}} provide {{high-quality}} caches made {{so by the}} difficulty of the hide or from the quality of the location. Membership is managed through a sponsorship system, and each cache is under continual peer review from other members. Terracaching.com embraces virtual caches alongside traditional or multi-stage caches and includes many locationless caches among the thousands of caches in its database. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>increasingly</b> attracting members who like the point system. In Europe, TerraCaching is supported by Terracaching.eu. This site is translated in different European languages, has an extended FAQ and extra supporting tools for TerraCaching. TerraCaching strongly discourages caches that are listed on other sites (so-called double-listing).|$|E
25|$|Because {{feathers}} {{are often}} associated with birds, feathered dinosaurs are often touted as the missing link between birds and dinosaurs. However, the multiple skeletal features also shared by the two groups represent the more important link for paleontologists. Furthermore, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>increasingly</b> clear {{that the relationship between}} birds and dinosaurs, and the evolution of flight, are more complex topics than previously realized. For example, while it was once believed that birds evolved from dinosaurs in one linear progression, some scientists, most notably Gregory S. Paul, conclude that dinosaurs such as the dromaeosaurs may have evolved from birds, losing the power of flight while keeping their feathers {{in a manner similar to}} the modern ostrich and other ratites.|$|E
25|$|The {{growth in}} {{usage of the}} Panama Canal {{over the past few}} years has been almost entirely driven by {{increased}} US imports from China passing through the canal en route to ports on the US East and Gulf coasts. But <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>increasingly</b> recognized in both the US and China that this imbalance in trade is unsustainable and will be reduced via some sort of adjustment in the coming years (although such an imbalance need not be made up by physically shipped goods, but could be made by other trade such as intellectual property as China upgrades its intellectual property protection laws). The ACP, however, presumes that trade will continue to grow for a generation as it has for the past several years.|$|E
50|$|In 1386, a {{conspiracy}} {{within the city}} council was uncovered. Background was the rivalry between {{the families of the}} Frispechers and the Fritzes. After this coup was thwarted the power of the council somewhat stabilized but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>increasingly</b> engrossed by the oligarchy of the guilds.|$|R
50|$|As {{railroads and}} steamships made European travel easier, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>increasingly</b> common for wealthy women {{to travel to}} Paris to shop for {{clothing}} and accessories.
