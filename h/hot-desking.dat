50|$|The Innovation Birmingham {{strategy}} {{is focused on}} a service offering for founders of new technology ventures, {{as well as more}} established tech businesses. The campus facilities include the Entrepreneurs for the Future (e4f) multi-occupancy start-up centre with <b>hot-desking</b> facilities and a wide range of flexible office units (115-4,000 sq ft) within the rest of Faraday Wharf. However, the campus is far from just bricks and mortar; the team actively nurtures an interactive and supportive community within the place. The Campus {{strategy is}} about encouraging people to visit, engage with the businesses based there, and attract new tenants to join the thriving tech community. By creating a wide range of valuable opportunities, the missing aspects of a successful business puzzle can be resolved, helping innovators and tech entrepreneurs gain invaluable exposure and to succeed.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide a sociological {{analysis}} of emergent sociospatial structures in a <b>hot-desking</b> office environment, where space is used exchangeably. It considers <b>hot-desking</b> as part of broader societal shifts in the ownership of space. This analysis is based on an ethnographically-oriented investigation, in which data collection methods used were participant-observation and interviewing. The analysis uses Lefebvre's conceptualisation of the social production of space and draws on the urban sociology literature...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} case for ‘cultural and {{creative}} design collectives’ in design education. Higher education taught design courses use a diversity of studio models ranging from the atelier format in which students have their own shared studio space, through to <b>hot-desking</b> and, increasingly, no-desking formats. Drawing on observation and experimentation with pedagogical and organizational formats and case studies in industrial design and architecture, the authors investigate whether peer group excellence is best achieved by encouraging and facilitating a cultural and creative collective among students, in which ownership, learning and definition of the course increasingly falls to the student group, leaving staff to act as catalysts and enablers, while offering students an objective critique. Through examples, the authors examine how this collective-peer approach in education impacts {{on the ability of}} graduate designers entering practice to work flexibly and in modes in which competition and collaboration can co-exist...|$|E
40|$|Communication {{issues are}} found {{to be one of the}} major prob-lems for {{software}} engineering teams. Trying to find a new approach to these problems, we studied the effect of different workspace arrangements on team’s communication. During our case study we observed that through affecting communi-cation behavior workspace indirectly affects the shared iden-tity of the team. We take the position that communication is the main process through which people reduce uncertainty related to their team, familiarize themselves with members of their team, as well as develop cognitive salience to other members of their team. They create an image of members of their team with which to relate themselves, and possi-bly categorize others as members of one’s team, i. e. ”We” or, in case of lack of communication as non-members, i. e. ”Them”. We found that assignation of workspaces affects the emergence of team identity through its effect on com-munication behavior but also that social categorization can negatively affect the communication behavior in <b>hot-desking</b> workspaces, further inhibiting the emergence of team identi-fication. Implications for practice as well as possibilities for further study are discussed. 1...|$|E
40|$|Daylight factor {{has long}} been the {{predominant}} metric to evaluate daylight performance. Recently, the profession has moved toward annual dynamic daylight metrics such as useful daylight illuminance and daylight autonomy, which are based on absolute values of time varying daylight illuminance for a period of full year. As opposed to static daylight metrics that only concentrate on individual sky conditions, such as the widely used daylight factor, these metrics provide a more comprehensive way to measure illuminance {{for a wide range of}} sun positions and sky conditions. Although there is a growing consensus assigning importance to dynamic daylight metrics, there is no common understanding of how to integrate the preference and behaviour of building occupants in assessing the applicability of these metrics. In fact, it is when these occupancy observations and quantitative measurements are taken together that the importance of daylight performance metrics is fully realized. This study seeks to investigate the extent to which the influence of daylight on behaviour can be predicted, and for this the behaviour investigated is seating preferences of occupants in open plan, <b>hot-desking</b> spaces in two university libraries in Sheffield: Western Bank Library and the Information Commons. The results suggest that the association between daylight and seat choice may not be strong, and that any effect is better associated with daylight factor than with useful daylight illuminance or daylight autonomy...|$|E
40|$|The ‘studio’ is {{typically}} {{viewed as being}} central {{to the role of}} educating architecture students because it facilitates learning during the design process, it encourages the integration of knowledge and skills, and it generates an environment where professional norms and standards are cultivated. The lineage of the ‘studio’ in architectural education extends back to the first ‘university’ courses in the 19 th century and before these aspects of the master/apprenticeship model, in the 17 th and 18 th centuries. A recent comprehensive study of Architectural Educators in Australasia (Ostwald & Williams 2008) revealed that definitions of the studio and associated practices were for the most part polarised. In Australia, the studio may physically range from a dedicated workspace –for groups of students to work and learn in – to a <b>hot-desking</b> arrangement, to a generic tutorial space. For some, the studio has ceased to include the physical workspace for students and become the approach to teaching design or the reference to the unit of study. Despite this difference of opinion, it is a common assumption that the studio is a familiar and well-understood concept amongst architectural educators. This paper will discuss the new context that the studio operates within and explore the issues and factors that have prompted such quandaries and for some, opportunities to expand the approaches used to teach design. The paper will also draw on, and make comparisons with, with studies from Europe and Northern America...|$|E
40|$|The {{context of}} this {{research}} focuses on the efficacy of design studio {{as a form of}} teaching and learning. The established model of project-based teaching makes simple parallels between studio and professional practice. However, through comparison of the discourses it is clear that they are of different character. The protocols of the tutorial tradition can act to position the tutor as a defender of the knowledge community rather than a discourse guide for the student. The question arises as to what constitutes the core knowledge that would enable better self-directed study. Rather than focus on key knowledge, there has been an attempt in other fields to agree and share ‘threshold concepts’ within disciplinary knowledge. Meyer and Land describe threshold concepts as representing “a transformed way of understanding, or interpreting or viewing something without which the learner cannot progress [1]. The tutor’s role should be to assist in transforming student’s understanding through the mastery of the ‘troublesome knowledge’ that threshold concepts may embody. Teaching and learning environments under such approaches have been described as ‘liminal’: holding the learner in an ‘in-between’ state new understanding may be difficult and involve identity shifts. Research on the consequence of pressures on facilities and studio space concur, and indicate that studio spaces can be much better used in assisting the path of learning [2]. Through an overview map of threshold concepts, the opportunities for blended learning in supporting student learning in the liminal space of the design studio become much clearer [3] Design studio needs to be recontextualised within the discourse of higher education scholarship, based on a clarified curriculum built from an understanding of what constitutes its threshold concepts. The studio needs to be reconsidered as a space quite unlike that of the practitioner, a liminal space. 1. 	Meyer, J. H. F. and R. Land, Threshold concepts and troublesome knowledge.

40|$|Activity-Based Working (ABW) is {{supported}} by work environments that combine <b>hot-desking</b> {{with a variety of}} workplaces, designed to support different types of activities. While the advantages of these work environments in terms of efficiency are undisputed, their effectiveness with respect to job performance and satisfaction is still doubtful, at least as a one-size-fits-all solution. So far research has produced ambiguous and sometimes contradictory findings, indicating that situational factors (e. g. interior design, organisational culture, implementation process) may play an important role. Such factors cannot explain however, why we see major differences between individual users. Hence, the purpose of this research is to analyse individual differences in psychological needs and their effects on behavioural patterns and workplace satisfaction. Since workplace satisfaction {{has been found to be}} related to job satisfaction and job performance, we consider it as an indicator for the effectiveness of an ABW environment. Repeated measurements were collected, using a mobile application. Participants reported their activities, the types of workplaces they used, and the degree of workplace satisfaction they experienced. They also filled out a questionnaire regarding (among others) their psychological characteristics: need for autonomy, need for structure, need for relatedness, need for privacy and need for competence. Data have been collected at four different organisations, resulting a total of 7457 measurements, reported by 214 participants. These data have been analysed using a logistic regression model. Data analysis is still in progress; complete results will be available at the USE conference. Preliminary findings indicate significant impact of several psychological needs on the use and appreciation of activity-based workplaces. As expected, people high in need for structure appear to switch less often between different types of workplaces, whereas people high in need for autonomy appear to switch more often. When activities that require a high level of concentration are carried out in open work environments, a high need for privacy seems to predict workplace dissatisfaction, whereas a high need for relatedness seems to predict less negative satisfaction ratings. Our preliminary findings clearly confirm the general idea that individual differences regarding psychological needs influence both behavioural patterns (choosing and switching between different types of workplaces) and workplace satisfaction. Further analysis of the dataset is needed to deepen and broaden the insights and to reveal the predictive value of these psychological needs regarding the use and appreciation of activity-based workplaces, also in comparison with other factors like activity type and job characteristics. The aforementioned insights are highly relevant for both researchers and practitioners. The selected set of psychological needs seems to provide a useful framework for future research focusing on individual differences within the broader context of changing work styles and work environments. Such research may contribute to the development of evidence-based workplace theories and concepts that take into account the variety of psychological needs that have to be fulfilled in order to achieve goals regarding job performance and satisfaction. At a more basic level, research that demonstrates the importance of individual (psychological) differences regarding workplace needs may increase awareness within organisations and among users, stimulating them to pay more attention to assessing, discussing and facilitating these differences...|$|E
