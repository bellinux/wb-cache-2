500|$|Fabulous Histories (later {{known as}} The Story of the Robins), Trimmer's most popular work, was first {{published}} in 1786, and remained in print until the beginning of the 20th century. It tells the story of two families, a robin family and a human family, who learn to live together congenially. Most importantly, the human children and the baby robins must learn to adopt virtue and to shun vice. For Trimmer, practising kindness to animals as a child would hopefully lead one to [...] "universal benevolence" [...] as an adult. According to Samuel Pickering, Jr., a scholar of 18th-century children's literature, [...] "in its depiction of 18th-century attitudes toward animals, Mrs. Trimmer’s Fabulous Histories was the most representative children’s book of the period". [...] The text expresses most of the themes that would come to dominate Trimmer's later works, such as her emphasis on retaining social hierarchies; as Tess Cosslett, a scholar of children's literature explains, [...] "the notion of hierarchy that underpins Fabulous Histories is relatively stable and fixed. Parents are above children in terms of authority, and humans above animals, in terms both of dominion and compassion: poor people should be fed before hungry animals… [...] the <b>hierarchical</b> <b>relation</b> of men and women is not so clearly enforced." [...] Moira Ferguson, a scholar of the 18th and 19th centuries, places these themes in a larger historical context, arguing that [...] "the fears of the author and her class about an industrial revolution in ascendance and its repercussions are evident. Hence, [...] text attacks cruelty to birds and animals while affirming British aggression abroad. [...] …The text subtly opts for conservative solutions: maintenance of order and established values, resignation and compliance from the poor at home, expatriation for foreigners who do not assimilate easily." [...] A second overarching theme in the text is rationality; Trimmer expresses the common fear of the power of fiction in her preface, explaining to her childish readers that her fable is not real and that animals cannot really speak. Like many social critics during the 18th century, Trimmer was concerned about fiction's potentially damaging impact on young readers. With the rise of the novel and its concomitant private reading, there was a great fear that young people and especially women would read racy and adventurous stories without the knowledge of their parents and, perhaps even more worrisome, interpret the books as they pleased. Trimmer therefore always referred to her text as Fabulous Histories and never as The Story of the Robins in order to emphasize its reality; moreover, she did not allow the book to be illustrated within her lifetime—pictures of talking birds would only have reinforced the paradox of the book (it was fiction parading as a history). Yarde has also speculated that most of the characters in the text are drawn from Trimmer's own acquaintances and family.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{quantify}} semantic inconsistency in UMLS concepts {{from the}} perspective of their <b>hierarchical</b> <b>relations</b> and to show through examples how semantically-inconsistent concepts can help reveal erroneous synonymy relations. Methods: Inconsistency is defined in reference to concepts from the UMLS Metathesaurus. Consistency is evaluated by comparing the semantic groups of the two concepts in each pair of hierarchically-related concepts. A limited number of inconsistent concepts was inspected manually. Results: 81, 512 concepts are inconsistent due to the differences in semantic groups between a concept and its parent. Four examples of wrong synonymy are presented. Conclusions: A vast majority of inconsistent <b>hierarchical</b> <b>relations</b> are not indicative of any errors. We discovered an interesting semantic pattern along hierarchies, which seems associated with wrong synonymy. Keywords: Unified medical language system, Semantic consistency...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION Biomedical terminologies {{are used}} {{as a source of}} {{knowledge}} in many applications. More specifically, the <b>hierarchical</b> <b>relations</b> represented in terminologies (parent/child, broader/narrower than) provide surrogate subsumption relations (isa, subclass of). Most terminologies are organized into hierarchies. In terms of data structure, single-inheritance hierarchies are trees and multiple-inheritance hierarchies are directed graphs. Such hierarchical structures can be traversed easily, making it possible for users to find paths among concepts and to compute transitive closures. By integrating more than 100 vocabularies into a unique semantic space, the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus creates a large graph with over one million nodes (concepts) and nearly 5 million <b>hierarchical</b> <b>relations.</b> Because it results from the integration of hierarchical structures representing partial ordering relations, the Metathesaurus graph is expected to be acyclic:...|$|R

However, relatively {{little is known}} about how these spatialized power relations are reproduced on a day-to-day basis. Drawing on a ten-month ethnographic study of a large government office in China, we find that hierarchical space is produced through three intertwined processes. It proliferates as employees actively seek out signs of hierarchy in the organization’s space; it becomes familiarized as employees fabricate and circulate fanciful narratives about their spatial environs; and it is ritualized by employees acting out <b>hierarchical</b> <b>relations</b> across the organization’s space. These processes resulted in a hardening of the <b>hierarchical</b> <b>relations</b> of power. The study extends the existing literature by showing how hierarchical organizational space is not just something that is imposed on employees; it is also imposed by the employees themselves...|$|R

In this study of the struggle to create the egalitarian workplace in five worker cooperatives in Buenos Aires, I will follow Irigaray’s argument that <b>hierarchical</b> <b>relations</b> will be continuously recreated if the patriarchal underpinnings of our symbolic structures which consign women always to the position of the lesser is not confronted. Workers and bosses come in two sexes: the individual without a sex does not exist, and to use the sexless individual as an analytical category simply obscures who has power and who does not. An absence of attention to sexual difference, which maintains that symbolically women are the same as men and experience the processes of organizing in exactly the same way, obscures rather than clarifies how we as women and men might organize in fully participatory, contiguous or non-hierarchical ways to get things done. Dismantling <b>hierarchical</b> <b>relations</b> between bosses and workers also means dismantling <b>hierarchical</b> <b>relations</b> between women and men: this study is an examination of what was accomplished in these five coops in terms of rethinking deference and rethinking difference...|$|R
