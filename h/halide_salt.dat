5000|$|Hexafluorophosphate salts {{are often}} {{included}} in organometallic syntheses {{to provide an}} inert and non-coordinating counterion. Tetrafluoroborate salts are a common alternative choice. One route to such compounds involves reactions with silver hexafluorophosphate with the <b>halide</b> <b>salt.</b> Precipitation of insoluble silver <b>halide</b> <b>salt</b> helps drive this reaction to completion. Since hexafluorophosphate salts are often insoluble in water but soluble in polar organic solvents, even the addition of ammonium hexafluorophosphate (NH4PF6) to aqueous solutions of many organic and inorganic salts gives solid precipitates of hexafluorophosphate salts. This method can have advantages over the silver hexafluorophosphate method in terms of expense and in systems where contamination with metal ions is strongly discouraged. As an example, the microwave synthesis of rhodicinium hexafluorophosphate involves the reaction of cyclopentadiene and rhodium(III) chloride hydrate in methanol. During the workup with methanolic ammonium hexafluorophosphate the product salt precipitates cleanly from the reaction mixture. [...] The overall conversion equation is ...|$|E

5000|$|Hexafluorophosphate organic salts {{that are}} soluble in organic {{solvents}} and ionic liquids are well known. The routes to such compounds {{are similar to}} those used for organometallic salts, such as anion exchange from the <b>halide</b> <b>salt</b> with silver hexafluorophosphate or use of ammonium hexafluorophosphate. Room temperature ionic liquids such as 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate (typically abbreviated as bmimPF6) have been prepared. The advantage of the anion exchange in favour of a non-coordinating anion is that the resulting ionic liquid has much higher thermally stability. The reason is that the possibility of decomposition of the imidazolium cation is decreased; 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride could decompose to N-methylimidazole and 1-chlorobutane or to N-butylimidazole and chloromethane. Such decompositions are not possible for bmimPF6 [...] However, thermal decompositions of hexafluorophosphate ionic liquids to generate hydrogen fluoride gas are known.|$|E
50|$|Typically, two {{catalysts}} {{are needed}} for this reaction: a zerovalent palladium complex and a <b>halide</b> <b>salt</b> of copper(I). Examples of such palladium catalysts include compounds in which palladium is ligated to phosphines (Pd(PPh3)4). A common derivative is Pd(PPh3)2Cl2, but bidentate ligand catalysts, such as Pd(dppe)Cl, Pd(dppp)Cl2, and Pd(dppf)Cl2 have also been used. The drawback to such catalysts {{is the need for}} high loadings of palladium (up to 5 mol %), along with a larger amount of a copper co-catalyst. PdII is often employed as a pre-catalyst since it exhibits greater stability than Pd0 {{over an extended period of}} time and can be stored under normal laboratory conditions for months. The Pd II catalyst is reduced to Pd0 in the reaction mixture by either an amine, a phosphine ligand, or a reactant, allowing the reaction to proceed. The oxidation of triphenylphosphine to triphenylphosphine oxide can also lead to the formation of Pd0 in situ when catalysts such as bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) chloride are used.|$|E
