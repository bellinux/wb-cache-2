25|$|An amateur {{radio station}} {{established}} in a permanent structure with equipment {{that is not}} intended for portable operation {{is referred to as}} a fixed station. This is {{the most common form of}} amateur radio station, and can be found in homes, schools, and some public buildings. A typical fixed station is equipped with a transceiver and one or more antennas. For voice communications, the station will be equipped with a microphone; for communications using the Morse code, a telegraph key is common; and for communications over digital modes such as RTTY and PSK31, a station will be equipped with a specialized interface to connect the transceiver to a computer sound card. While not a requirement for radiocommunications, most fixed amateur radio stations are equipped with one or more computers, which serve tasks ranging from logging of contacts with other stations to various levels of station hardware control. <b>Fixed</b> <b>stations</b> might also be equipped with amplifiers, antenna rotators, SWR meters, and other station accessories.|$|E
2500|$|These {{protocols}} gave {{rules for}} imperial progresses {{to and from}} certain churches at Constantinople and the imperial palace, with <b>fixed</b> <b>stations</b> and rules for ritual actions and acclamations from specified participants (the text of acclamations and processional troparia or kontakia, but also heirmoi are mentioned), among them also ministers, senate members, leaders of the [...] "Blues" [...] (Venetoi) and the [...] "Greens" [...] (Prasinoi)—chariot teams during the hippodrome's horse races. They had an important role during court ceremonies. The following chapters (84–95) are taken from a 6th-century manual by Peter the Patrician. They rather describe administrative ceremonies such as the appointment of certain functionaries (ch. 84,85), investitures of certain offices (86), the reception of ambassadors and the proclamation of the Western Emperor (87,88), the reception of Persian ambassadors (89,90), Anagorevseis of certain Emperors (91–96), the appointment of the senate's proedros (97). The [...] "palace order" [...] did not only prescribe the way of movements (symbolic or real) including on foot, mounted, by boat, but also the costumes of the celebrants and who has to perform certain acclamations. The emperor often {{plays the role of}} Christ and the imperial palace is chosen for religious rituals, so that the ceremonial book brings the sacred and the profane together. Book II seems to be less normative and was obviously not compiled from older sources like book I, which often mentioned outdated imperial offices and ceremonies, it rather describes particular ceremonies as they had been celebrated during particular imperial receptions during the Macedonian renaissance.|$|E

40|$|On cruise KH- 94 - 4 of the {{research}} vessel HAKUHO MARU, we measured aerosol concentrations over the western Pacific Ocean and the Southern Ocean. Aitken particle concentration was measured with a Pollak condensation nuclei counter. Size distribution for large and giant particles was measured with an optical particle counter. On this expedition, we observed at a nearly <b>fixed</b> <b>station</b> (64 - 65. 5 °S, 140 °E) twice, in December 1994 and January 1995,for a total of sixteen days. The concentrations of Aitken particles at the <b>fixed</b> <b>station</b> were somewhat higher than those measured around 10 °N latitude during this expedition and previous expeditions. These values were nearly equal to or lower than values obtained by other workers. Moreover, Aitken particle concentration at the <b>fixed</b> <b>station</b> sometimes showed a clear diurnal variation. This implies that they were produced by gas-to-particle conversion of organosulfur gases. For large and giant particles, we first confirmed the effect of wind force on the size distribution over the Southern Ocean.
