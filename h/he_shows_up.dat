Only in The Spy Who Loved Me, one of Kael's favourite Bond films, did she praise him describing him as self-effacing: [...] "Moore gets the chance to look scaredan emotion that suits him and makes him more likable".|$|E

500|$|Anne Bower {{writes about}} Jewish {{characters}} at mealtime {{as part of}} the broader movement she believes started in the 1960s where filmmakers started producing work that explored the [...] "Jewish self-definition." [...] She postulates that the dinner table becomes an arena where Jewish characters are often and most pointedly put into [...] "conflicts with their ethnic and sexual selves." [...] She describes the example of Greg sitting down for dinner with the Byrnes family and being asked to bless the food. In this scene, Greg attempts to recite a prayer by improvising and, in doing so, launches into a recital of the song [...] "Day by Day" [...] from Act I of Godspell. Bower notes this scene as [...] "particularly important for establishing the cultural distance" [...] between the Jewish Greg and the Christian Byrnes. She noted that the social gap is further widened next morning when Greg is the last person to arrive at the breakfast table; <b>he</b> <b>shows</b> <b>up</b> wearing pajamas while everyone else is fully clothed. Here Greg is shown eating a bagel, which Bower argues as being a clear signifier of Jewishness.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Brian K. Roberts and {{directed}} by Jim Reardon. Prior to writing the episode, Roberts had been an audio and visual editor on the show. Musician Ringo Starr made a guest appearance in the episode as himself. He was the first Beatle {{to appear on the}} show; both George Harrison and Paul McCartney would later guest star on the show in the season five episode [...] "Homer's Barbershop Quartet" [...] and the season seven episode [...] "Lisa the Vegetarian" [...] respectively. When the story of Marge having a crush on Starr was pitched out, Roberts took the opportunity to write Starr into the script because he had always wanted to meet a Beatle. He then sent the script to Starr, who was then in Southern France. Starr agreed to do the guest appearance after only reading two lines, and he told Roberts that {{he would be able to}} do it when he visited Los Angeles a few weeks later. The staff of the show was thrilled when Roberts revealed that Starr had agreed to do it, and they immediately decided to expand Starr's role in the script. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening said of the guest appearance: [...] "We were so excited that we got Ringo Starr coming in to do the show and we recorded him over at the Complex in West Los Angeles. We were given a list of rules about what we couldn't do to Ringo, such as 'Don't touch him', 'Don't approach him', and 'Don't ask for his autograph'. But of course when <b>he</b> <b>shows</b> <b>up</b> in this big limo, Brian brings out a big poster and asks him to sign it!" [...] Roberts explained that he had not received the memo with the rules so he showed up with a copy of the script cover and asked Starr to sign it. Groening asked Starr if he wanted to be animated the way he was in Yellow Submarine or the way he was in the cartoon series The Beatles. Starr chose Yellow Submarine because he did not like his appearance in the cartoon. In addition to Starr, the episode features a guest appearance by Jon Lovitz as Lombardo and the doughnut delivery man that delivers doughnuts to the nuclear power plant. Lombardo's physical appearance was based on an art teacher Reardon had in art school.|$|E

2500|$|Andrew Unterberger of {{the website}} PopDust wrote that Flo Rida was [...] "exactly" [...] what the {{original}} version of [...] "We Found Love" [...] was missing. He added, [...] "No Rihanna, you got it backwardsâ€”it's Flo Rida who needs to have other, more talented people on his songs in order {{to turn them into}} hits, not the other way around... At least this remix does feature a sizeable contribution from Flo, as <b>he</b> <b>shows</b> <b>up</b> on both the intro and over the song's primary instrumental hook with his trademark unintelligble yammering, though he gets in at least one reference to rocking a party 'like I'm Mick Jagger.'" [...] Matthew Perpetua of Rolling Stone praised the remix of the song, saying that [...] "once again, Flo Rida shows his true rapping skills over the beat of Rihanna's 'We Found Love'". Both Billboards Erika Ramirez and Spins Marc Hogan praised the remixed version calling it [...] "refreshing" [...] and [...] "interesting". However, Becky Bain of the website Idolator was more negative towards the remix. She noted, [...] "Being that Rihanna's 'We Found Love' has enough beats and synths to be its own remix, not to mention it couldn't possibly be even more popular on the Hot 100... we find it pointless to release {{a new version of the}} single with Flo Rida." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bill (Rick Green) is {{the star}} of the [...] "Adventures with Bill" [...] segment, in which he and at least one other {{character}} (usually Red) attempt to perform relatively simple tasks or try a sport or game in the clumsiest, most accident-prone way possible. (These segments are done in a silent home-movie format with a voiceover by Red.) Bill rarely actually speaks, and has only appeared on the main set of the show in the second season (still silently) and in the series' final episodeâ€”these are also the only times Bill is ever seen in colour (though <b>he</b> <b>shows</b> <b>up</b> in color {{at the end of the}} credits sequence for the first season, at least), since the [...] "Adventures" [...] segments are shown in black & white. [...] When something goes wrong, as it invariably does each episode, Bill can be heard as a muffled scream; these are anticipation of injury, not actual injury, such as Bill screaming as he falls off the ladder, not when he hits the ground. [...] In some segments, Bill can be heard speaking in gibberish, but the explanation for not hearing him clearly is usually that the camera they use for these segments has a weak microphone. Later in the show's history, the [...] "Adventures with Bill" [...] segment was expanded to include more characters and not necessarily Bill himself.|$|E
50|$|Moreno {{had surgery}} {{performed}} and rehabbed at Triple-A in 2002, but then <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> {{out of shape}} from the long layoff and was released. Soon after that he signed with the Mets, pitching for them from 2003 to 2004.|$|R

5000|$|Thomas {{was first}} {{introduced}} in the third book of the series, Grave Peril, where <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> at the ball hosted by Bianca, a vampire of the Red Court. His presence there, instead {{of the presence of}} his father, was an insult to Bianca planned by Thomas's father, Lord Raith. <b>He</b> <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> with Justine, his girlfriend, whom he had [...] "poached" [...] from Bianca. However, as Thomas is a vampire, he feeds on Justine, causing damage to her soul. He ends up betraying Harry to save Justine, but helps him and Michael later, after Justine is kidnapped by Bianca. He returns Michael's sword to him, and helps them journey through the Nevernever.|$|R
