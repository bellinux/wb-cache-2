40|$|The main {{scope of}} this {{dissertation}} has been to give {{a contribution to the}} evaluation of seismic performance of CFS structures and in particular of <b>diagonal</b> <b>strap</b> braced walls. To this end, two main objectives are pursued in this work: the study of the seismic behaviour of <b>diagonal</b> <b>strap</b> braced walls in terms of global response and the study of local behaviour of connections to understand their influence on the global seismic behaviour of walls. In the context of ReLUIS-DPC project, a wide experimental program was planned and carried out. It consists of full-scale experimental tests on walls to investigate the global behaviour and small-scale experimental tests on materials, simple mechanical joints and connections to investigate the influence of the local behaviour on the global seismic behaviour. The experimental tests have been performed at the Dist Laboratory (Department of Structures for Engineering and Architecture, Naples), of the University of Naples Federico II. The obtained results demonstrate a satisfactory experimental response in terms of stiffness, strength and deformation capacity, largely confirming the theoretical predictions. Since the final scope of the whole study, and in particular of the experimental campaign, is to provide appropriate design criteria for <b>diagonal</b> <b>strap</b> braced CFS structures to be introduced in Italian seismic code, considerations about design criteria were presented, {{on the basis of the}} design assumptions and the experimental test results, in comparison with the prescriptions of national and international seismic codes. The attention is focused on the behaviour factor, the diagonal brace verifications and the overstrength of fragile elements...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{differential}} {{model of the}} hysteretic behavior of unsheathed x-braced frames. The model includes all the relevant aspects (perfect or hardening plasticity of <b>diagonal</b> <b>straps</b> under tension, buckling of <b>diagonal</b> <b>straps</b> under compression). The frame is treated as a single-degree-of-freedom system, and the hysteretic model is written as a small system of ordinary differential equations. In spite of this simplified modelling approach, the proposed model captures the key features of hysteretic cycles of x-braced frames (extreme pinching and slackness) {{and can be used}} to obtain the q-factor for simplified seismic design based on the reduction of elastic spectra. The model also allows to couple several x-braced frames to obtain the response of more complex structures such as complete façades. In fact, the agreement with a more sophisticated approach, such as a finite element model of the frame, is excellent, but the computational cost is considerably lower. This point is illustrated by various numerical examples. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author’s final draft...|$|R

40|$|Occupant Restraint Systems (ORS) {{have been}} widely used in Public Service Vehicles (PSVs). A Wheelchair Tiedown and Occupant Restraint System (WTORS) has been {{developed}} to provide effective occupant protection for disabled people who are seated in wheelchairs. An international laboratory study had been conducted to produce a compliance test protocol that included specification of the sled deceleration versus time history and the crash pulse corridor. Currently effort at the international level is being focused through the International Standards Organisation (ISO) to produce standards for WTORS and transportable wheelchairs. Dynamic sled testing of WTORS was conducted in Middlesex University Road Safety Engineering Laboratory (MURSEL) to develop a test protocol in a WTORS System. This research has been concerned with the effects to which the occupant of a wheelchair secured by a WTORS is subjected in a frontal impact. Both occupant Forward Facing Frontal (FFF) and Rearward Facing Frontal (RFF) impact configurations have been considered. A Surrogate wheelchair with a tiedown restraint System, a Surrogate occupant restraint System, and an Anthropomorphic Test Dummy (ATD) were used to facilitate highly controlled tests. Production wheelchairs were also crash tested to validate the response of the Surrogate System. A 48 km/h- 20 g crash pulse falling within the ISO standard crash pulse corridor was specified. The Crash Victim Simulation (CVS), one of the computer modelling methods, and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) models were designed to study the dynamic response of a restrained wheelchair and its occupant in a crash environment. Two CVS computer packages: MADYMO®, DYNAMAN® and one of FEA programs: PAFEC were used in WTORS models to predict the occupant response during impacts and hence provide data to optimise future system design. A modelling protocol for WTORS was developed {{based on the results of}} ninety (90) sled tests of WTORS Surrogate system and forty (40) dynamic tests of production wheelchairs. To illustrate the potential of these models the results of simulations were validated by sled tests. A random effects Statistical method was used to quantify the results. The load-time histories were also traced to qualify the test and model results. A literature review highlighted twenty years of wheelchair crash research. The correlation between computer model and experimental results was made more accurately. The modelling technique of interconnection of FEA models into CVS program was also introduced. The velocity profile and the natural frequency of WTORS analysis were used to explain why the wheelchair and dummy experienced acceleration amplifications relative to the sled. The shoulder belt load at floor-mounted configuration was found to be higher than that at B pillar configuration. Energy principles were also applied to show why more compliant wheelchair tiedown Systems subjected restraints to a less severe crash environment. A decomposition of forces using the computer model showed why quasi-static analysis is insufficient in WTORS design. It is concluded that the B pillar anchorage of the occupant <b>diagonal</b> <b>strap</b> is superior to the floor-mounted configuration...|$|E

Two dominant failure modes are identified: (1) tilting and net section failure (T+NSF) and (2) tilting, bearing and pull out (T+B+PO). The analysis in terms of strength and ductility shows that T+NSF joints are suitable for seismic design, because the straps yield before the connections fail. T+B+PO joints, on the contrary, are not suited because the connection fails before the straps can yield. The influence of various design parameters (strap thickness, number and diameter of screws, steel grade) in the failure mode is studied, and design criteria to induce a T+NSF response are given.

40|$|Buildings {{composed}} of cold-formed steel (CFS) framing systems have become popular {{in many parts}} of the world. Light-gauge CFS frames can be built up from C-shaped sections and laterally braced with tension-only thin strap members. Recent research has raised many concerns about the lateral performance of these light wall systems in regions of high seismic activity. This paper focuses on the failure modes of different systems and on the main factors contributing to the ductile response of the CFS walls. The aim is to ensure that the <b>diagonal</b> <b>straps</b> yield and respond plastically with a significant drift, thereby preventing any risk of brittle failure such as connection failure or column buckling. Several superior connection details are then proposed, which provide a reliable lateral performance even in large lateral deformations by using perforated straps and/or bracket members in four corners of the wall. Performance of the proposed systems is evaluated by experimental tests on full-scale 2. 4 m x 2. 4 m and 1. 2 m x 2. 4 in specimens under a particular cyclic load regime. Method B of ASTM E 2126 - 05 standard was selected as lateral loading regime, which introduces a progressively increasing cyclic loading with two stabilized cycles at each displacement amplitude. In order to maximize the precision of the result, each specimen was connected to the testing rig by high strength bolt. The tests showed that all of the new proposed systems can provide reliable response with good ductility and maintain their lateral and vertical load-bearing abilities up to a relative lateral displacements of 3. 3 %, which was the limit of the testing rig...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{application}} of load path algorithms to define trajectories for placement of reinforcing fibres in membrane tension structures. Load paths can define how a structure performs its intended load carrying function transferring loads from a point of application {{to a point of}} reaction. In recent years, a novel method to compute these paths has emerged in the literature using finite element analysis yet common FEA packages do not have options to generate these paths. Therefore load path generation needs to be performed by integration of an external numerical computing environment (i. e. MATLAB or FORTRAN). In this thesis a method of visualizing of load paths in membrane structures has been achieved by overlaying of link and shell elements in the commercial finite element program ANSYS. The method is based on equilibrium of nodal forces and starts with consideration of trusses. Load flow is identified by removing elements from an over populated model using an evolutionary method. The design procedure is iterated for a number of loops by slowly deactivating inefficient elements by a scalar criterion in ANSYS programming language. The integrity of this design technique is verified by analyzing number of models (trusses and shells). The work is then extended to membrane structures. Static structural analysis using finite element geometric nonlinear analysis due to the large deflection is conducted for a rectangle membrane under uniform pressure. Shell and link elements in the model represent the main cloth and possible carbon fibre paths respectively. By introducing the procedure of elimination, two <b>diagonal</b> <b>straps</b> of link elements bridging the corners remained in the corner fixed structure. The final application of this research is cruising boat sails which are analyzed with the proposed nonlinear programming formulation. The results from this work are compared to the patterns in existing sails. Finally, this work concludes that defining load paths using overlaid link and shell elements for reinforcement of the structure can provide qualitative information on the trajectories followed by load in structures and it can predict trajectories for reinforcing carbon fibre paths. This thesis has focused on developing the numerical algorithms. A deeper investigation of manufacturing methods and collaboration with manufacturers of shade structures or yacht sails is recommended as future work...|$|R
