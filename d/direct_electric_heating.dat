The Ba content significantly increases on the surface layers of oxide cathodes down to several tens of nanometers in depth, after the cathode activation process. The lifetime of oxide cathodes can be evaluated with a stretched exponential function.

In order to adapt this wire to clinical use, {{it is necessary}} to bend as well as to control its super-elastic force, and so a <b>direct</b> <b>electric</b> resistance <b>heat</b> treatment (DERHT) method was developed. An electric current is passed directly through the wire, thus generating enough heat to make it possible to bend it as well as to impart a change in the super-elastic force of the wire.

Employing a sealed Pyrex glass vial and batch microwave conditions at 240 &# 176;C, the tetrazole is comparatively stable and complete decomposition to diphenylmethane requires more than 8 h. Similar kinetic data were obtained in conductively heated flow devices with either stainless steel or Hastelloy coils in the same temperature region.

50|$|Energy {{efficiencies}} {{of water}} heaters in residential use can vary greatly, particularly depending on manufacturer and model. However, electric heaters {{tend to be}} slightly more efficient (not counting power station losses) with recovery efficiency (how efficiently energy transfers to the water) reaching about 98%. Gas fired heaters have maximum recovery efficiencies of only about 82-94% (the remaining heat is lost with the flue gasses). Overall energy factors can be as low as 80% for electric and 50% for gas systems. Natural gas and propane tank water heaters with energy factors of 62% or greater, as well as electric tank water heaters with energy factors of 93% or greater, are considered high-efficiency units. Energy Star-qualified natural gas and propane tank water heaters (as of September 2010) have energy factors of 67% or higher, which is usually achieved using an intermittent pilot together with an automatic flue damper, baffle blowers, or power venting. <b>Direct</b> <b>electric</b> resistance tank water heaters {{are not included in}} the Energy Star program, however, the Energy Star program does include <b>electric</b> <b>heat</b> pump units with energy factors of 200% or higher. Tankless gas water heaters (as of 2015) must have an energy factor of 90% or higher for Energy Star qualification. Since electricity production in thermal plants has efficiency levels ranging from only 15% to slightly over 55% (combined cycle gas turbine), with around 40% typical for thermal power stations, <b>direct</b> resistance <b>electric</b> water <b>heating</b> may be the least energy efficient option. However, use of a heat pump can make electric water heaters much more energy efficient and lead to a decrease in carbon dioxide emissions, even more so if a low carbon source of electricity is used.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an empirical {{analysis of the}} supply-side constraints that impact household choices of space heating systems in French dwellings. Based on data from the 2006 National Housing Survey and the 2013 Household Survey, we estimate discrete choice models using socio-demographic, dwelling and spatial characteristics as determinants of choice. In order to capture the supply-side constraints, we perform a post-estimation clustering based on the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, which allows us to determine the groups of households that {{are most likely to}} choose each considered space heating system. The results suggest that for 2006, households living in individual houses preferred to heat space using an individual boiler, whereas those living in apartments opted for <b>direct</b> <b>electric</b> <b>heating.</b> In 2013 all households preferred <b>direct</b> <b>electric</b> <b>heating,</b> and wood heating became their second choice. The discrete choice models do not show a significant change in behavior from 2006 to 2013. The post-estimation clustering indicates that many households were strongly constrained by the conditions and characteristics of their living space in 2006. The mean probability of choosing <b>direct</b> <b>electric</b> <b>heating</b> or a boiler was more than 0. 8 for 21 % of households living in houses and for 36 % living in apartments. Thus, these households did not seem to have a choice. In 2013 the supply-side constraints were weaker. The highest mean probability (0. 755) is observed in the group opting for an individual boiler.

40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore technologySubsea {{pipelines}} {{are increasingly}} being required to operate at high temperature and pressure HT/HP. The pipeline installed on the seabed and left exposed have a potential to buckle, walk and change configuration under high temperature and pressure (HT/HP). This could lead to failure of the Pipeline if buckling and walking is not properly controlled or mitigated. The objective of the thesis work is to study and understand the influence of pipeline-soil interaction {{on the design of}} surface laid subsea pipeline susceptible to lateral buckling and pipeline walking. The main focus of the thesis work is on the use of snake-lay configuration as a mitigating measure under controlled buckling design and rock dumping if needed to limit feed-in into buckle and end expansions; the effect of thermal gradient on axial walking and the use of <b>direct</b> <b>electric</b> <b>heating</b> (DEH) to reduce rate of walking. The snake-lay configuration is achieved by installing deliberate horizontal lay imperfection to trigger a sufficient number of thermal buckles at a pre-determined location along the pipeline. The desire is to limit pipeline expansion at the connecting ends by using snake-lay design with intermittent rock dumping. The work includes performing non-linear finite element analysis (FEA) and modeling the soilpipeline interaction of as-laid pipeline using general finite (FE) element software ANSYS. The results are discussed against the relevant design criteria based on design codes DNV-OS-F 101, DNV-RP-F 110 and Subsea 7 Lateral Buckling Analysis Design Guideline. FE analyses were performed to study the lateral buckling of a 2 km VAS model with an initial out-of-straightness (OOS) under operating temperature and pressure. Consequently, the effect of thermal gradient of an asymmetric heating process in pipeline walking phenomenon is investigated. Based on FE analyses findings, the use of <b>direct</b> <b>electric</b> <b>heating</b> (DEH) system to reduce the rate of axial walking is proposed and explained.

40|$|Consumers do not in all {{circumstances}} tend {{to behave}} as the neoclassical economic theory would predict. In fact, consumers have often the tendency to overweight the initial investment cost of a technology versus the operating costs that accrue in the future. In this thesis, the hypothesis is tested by investigating Finnish households’ heating mode choices in their newly built detached houses. If the hypothesis holds true, the lower level income households choose the heating mode that entails lowest initial investment costs despite the predicted future energy price development. Similarly, households with high income levels would have greater probability to choose more expensive heating modes. <b>Direct</b> <b>electric</b> <b>heating</b> is the most economical solution by its purchase price for a detached household in Finland and ground heat pump {{one of the most}} expensive. However, when discounting the predicted future energy costs back to the investment period, the NPV of ground heat pump for a type consumer is lower the NPV of the <b>direct</b> <b>electric</b> <b>heating.</b> The net savings of ground heat pump over its lifetime owes to the energy efficiency of the technology. If the diffusion of an energy efficient technology is very low despite being competitive, researchers talk about energy paradox. The empirical approach of this thesis belongs to the discrete choice model family. Multinomial logistic and logistic regression models are applied to predict the probabilities of households to choose certain heating mode. The model is estimated by utilizing data from Finnish research company Rakennustutkimus Ltd. The data contains heating mode choices as well as socio-economic information of 1, 260 Finnish households that were building a detached house in 2008. The results of the empirical examination do not give unreserved support for the hypothesis between income level and heating mode choice. Strong correlation between the income level and certain heating modes can be however found indicating that lower income level households would prefer <b>direct</b> <b>electric</b> <b>heating</b> and higher income level households ground heat pump. It is not possible to draw clear political implications based on the findings of the study. The importance of the empirical part of the study is to provide indication for further, wider and more profound study that should be conducted by applying more accurate data...|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} is to derive some simple rules for an optimal {{management}} of <b>direct</b> <b>electric</b> <b>heating</b> in residential buildings. Optimal management should minimise the running cost of heating while maintaining comfort, in the case of control strategies involving intermittent heating. This study has been carried out with the help of numerical simulation in a graphical environment [1] in order to study the behaviour of a whole system, referred to as a simulator, which consists of the building zone, the heating system and the controller. We chose an optimisation function of a mathematical software [2] to determine the optimal value of the operating cost. The coupling between the simulator and the optimisation algorithm is done automatically during the simulation in order to determine the optimal management scenario. The relevance of the work lies in the coupling between the simulator and the optimisation algorithm. This coupling was made possible thanks to the structuring of the simulator following a modelling methodology and parametering rules developed by CSTB [3]. The methodology enabled an efficient modelling of the system to carry out the optimisation analysis automatically on a large number of cases. The analysis by "experiment plans " on the simulation results obtained allowed the definition of rules for the optimal management of <b>direct</b> <b>electric</b> <b>heating.</b> This paper mainly presents the modelling methodology implemented.

40|$|The article {{describes}} the implementation of storage heaters. The main of topic is the evaluation of payback period of heating systems which use storage heaters. These systems are compared to district heating systems, gas heating systems and <b>direct</b> <b>electric</b> <b>heating</b> systems. The cost of all systems is taken as for Kyiv, Ukraine. The analysis shows that at the current price level the implementation of storage heaters (storage electric heating) is the best option for residential dwellings which use district heating and for other consumers which use <b>direct</b> <b>electric</b> <b>heating.</b> It leads to the greatest reduction of operating costs and thus reducing payback periods. So only these cases are used to evaluate possible payback period. It is important {{to mention that the}} smallest reduction in operating costs for both types of consumers are both in the case of replacing gas heating systems with storage heaters. In order to determine the payback period, it is calculated energy consumption per 1 kW of installed capacity of a storage heater and unit cost per 1 kW of installed capacity. Both manufactured in Ukraine and abroad storage heaters are presented in this article and their costs per 1 kW of installed capacity are analysed and compared. The payback period is analysed both for conditions of a simple calculation and for options when the discount rate is taking into account. Thus, the discount rate E varied from 0 to 22 %. The calculations, made in this article, show that the cost of a storage heater varies considerably, and under simple calculation (E = 0 %) and the minimum cost of a storage heater payback period may be 3 [...] . 5 years, and with higher value of discount rate E and the use of a more expensive storage heater, the payback period can exceed payback period of 20 years. ?????? ????????? ????????? ?????????????????????????? ?????????????, ? ?????? ??????????? ?????? ?? ??????????? ?? ????????? ? ??????????????? ?????????? ?????? ?????????. ? ?????????? ???????????? ? ?????? ??????? ????????, ??? ? ?????? ????????? ???? ???????? ???????? ???????? ??? ??????? ???????????? ?????? ????? ?? ?????? ??????? ?????????????? ?????????, ? ??? ????????? - ?? ?????? ???????????? ?????????. ???? ??????????? ??? ??????????????? ??? ??? ??????? ???????? ???????, ??? ? ??? ??????? ??????? ?????? ???????????????...|$|E
40|$|In many {{historic}} buildings, conservation heating {{has been}} used to control the RH in winter. Heat pumps are much more energy efficient than <b>direct</b> <b>electric</b> <b>heating,</b> so this technology may be adapted for climate control. Dehumidification has not been regarded as appropriate for historic buildings due to poor regulation, but recent development in electronic hygrostats makes this technology an attractive alternative.

The most energy efficient control strategy is determined by the U-value of the building, the air exchange rate and the volume. For large buildings conservation heating with heat pump technology seems to be the most energy efficient, unless the thermal insulation is very poor. For small buildings dehumidification is more efficient unless the building is very leaky. The two strategies for climate control were tested in historic houses owned by the National Museum in Denmark and used for exhibition only in the summer season.
