500|$|Murray cod have {{soft skin}} and very fine scales that leave them {{vulnerable}} to infection from <b>exotic</b> <b>disease</b> organisms. The following <b>exotic</b> <b>disease</b> organisms all seriously affect wild Murray cod; {{all have been}} introduced by imports of exotic fish. Chilodenella is a single-celled, parasitic protozoa that infects the skin of Murray cod and has caused a number of serious kills of wild Murray cod. Saprolegnia is a fungus-like oomycete or [...] "water mould" [...] that frequently infects Murray cod eggs and the skin of Murray cod that have been roughly handled through poor catch and release technique. (It is essential that Murray cod intended for release only touch cool wet surfaces and are not put down on any hard, dry, rough or hot surfaces, e.g. boat gunwales, boat floors, dry grass, dry rocks, gravel banks, dry towels or mats, etc. Hands should also be wetted before touching them. They must not be hung vertically by the mouth or gill covers.) Wild Murray cod populations across their range suffer extremely severe infestations of Lernaea or [...] "anchor worm", a parasitic copepod vectored by introduced carp and that burrows into the skin of Murray cod. Lernaea puncture wounds are often secondarily infected by bacteria. Severe Lernaea infestations probably causes the death of many more adult Murray cod than commonly recognised. Ebner reports a young adult Murray cod seemingly killed by severe Lernaea infestation.|$|E

40|$|Corsica is a French island {{located in}} the western part of the Mediterranean Sea. Traditional {{husbandry}} practices (e. g. free-ranging grazing), widespread wildlife populations, biophysical conditions ("Hot-summer Mediterranean" climate, mountainous ecosystems) and trade activities make this island vulnerable to the risk of emerging diseases. Corsica Island could therefore be used as sentinel area for surveillance of <b>exotic</b> <b>diseases</b> in South-western Europe. Its endemism, endogenous domestic and wild species, should be strongly protected from <b>exotic</b> <b>diseases...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The 2002 – 2003 <b>Exotic</b> Newcastle <b>Disease</b> (END) {{outbreak}} in Southern California poultry pro-vided {{an opportunity to}} evaluate environmental air sampling as an efficient and cost-effective means of sampling flocks for detection of a circulating virus. <b>Exotic</b> Newcastle <b>Disease</b> virus was detected by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR from air samples collected using a wetted-wall cyclone-style air sampler placed within 2 m of birds in 2 commercial flocks suspected of being naturally exposed to END virus during the outbreak. <b>Exotic</b> Newcastle <b>Disease</b> virus was detected after 2 hours of air sampling the poultry-house environments of the 2 naturally infected flocks. Key words: Air sampler; environmental sampling; <b>Exotic</b> Newcastle <b>Disease</b> Virus; RT-PCR.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the third phase of this project was to {{consolidate}} and extend the work undertaken in the preceding phases to develop the capability of the Institute in Sliven to diagnose <b>exotic</b> <b>diseases</b> of livestock and to produce vaccines for their control.

Substantial progress was made in the production of vaccines and in developing the techniques and viral preparations used for diagnosing <b>exotic</b> <b>diseases,</b> and it was considered that the Institute had reached the stage when it {{could be used as a}} training centre for specialists from developing countries, and as a national reference centre for exotic animal diseasesStudies of epizootic diseases in neighbouring countries were undertaken and the results underlined the need to maintain a continuous surveillance on the spread of <b>exotic</b> <b>diseases,</b> to ensure that there is provision for rapid diagnosis of suspect samples, and to preserve stocks of vaccines for use if a serious disease outbreak should occur. In this respect, it was very important to ensure that the laboratory equipment be maintained in proper working conditionThe statement drew attention to the essential need for the Institute to have financial autonomy, based on direct grants from the Government and income from the diagnostic services, vaccines and other products supplied to the private sector and the national veterinary servic...|$|R
