25|$|The President, however, {{does not}} have the final say over certain decisions, as Parliament may {{override}} his veto with a resolution supported by not less than two-thirds of all the elected MPs. For instance, this mechanism applies if the President vetoes key civil service appointments or withholds assent to bills that are likely to draw on the nation's past reserves. A prerequisite for the exercise of the override mechanism <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> must have disagreed with the recommendation of the Council of Presidential Advisers, which he is required consult before exercising these powers. The override mechanism shows that the President's discretionary powers pose no obstacle to a government which continues to enjoy untrammelled power so long as it controls a clear two-thirds parliamentary majority. The weaker the Government is, the stronger the presidential check is; and the stronger the Government, the weaker the presidential blocking mechanism.|$|E

60|$|I {{will not}} {{describe}} {{in detail the}} present mode of election, as the doing so would be tedious and unnecessary. Two facts I wish, however, to make specially noticeable and clear. The first <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> of the United States is now chosen by universal suffrage; and the second is, that the Constitution expressly intended that the President should not be chosen by universal suffrage, but by a body of men who should enjoy the confidence and fairly represent {{the will of the}} people. The framers of the Constitution intended so to write the words that the people themselves should have no more immediate concern in the nomination of the President than in that of the Senate. They intended to provide that the election should be made in a manner which may be described as thoroughly conservative. Those words, however, have been inefficient for their purpose. They have not been violated. But the spirit has been violated, while the words have been held sacred; and the presidential elections are now conducted on the widest principles of universal suffrage. They are essentially democratic.|$|E

60|$|Some {{people seem}} to suppose that the fall of President Wilson was a denial of this almost despotic ideal in America. As {{a matter of fact}} it was the strongest {{possible}} assertion of it. The idea <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> shall take responsibility and risk; and responsibility means being blamed, and risk means the risk of being blamed. The theory is that things are done by the President; and if things go wrong, or are alleged to go wrong, it is the fault of the President. This does not invalidate, but rather ratifies the comparison with true monarchs such as the mediaeval monarchs. Constitutional princes are seldom deposed; but despots were often deposed. In the simpler races of sunnier lands, such as Turkey, they were commonly assassinated. Even in our own history a King often received the same respectful tribute to the responsibility and reality of his office. But King John was attacked because he was strong, not because he was weak. Richard the Second lost the crown because the crown was a trophy, not because it was a trifle. And President Wilson was deposed because he had used a power which is such, in its nature, that a man must use it at the risk of deposition. As a matter of fact, of course, it is easy to exaggerate Mr. Wilson's real unpopularity, and still more easy to exaggerate Mr. Wilson's real failure. There are a great many people in America who justify and applaud him; and what is yet more interesting, who justify him not on pacifist and idealistic, but on patriotic and even military grounds. It is especially insisted by some that his demonstration, which seemed futile as a threat against Mexico, was a very far-sighted preparation for the threat against Prussia. But in so far as the democracy did disagree with him, it was but the occasional and inevitable result of the theory by which the despot has to anticipate the democracy.|$|E

Their position <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> Robert Kocharyan had come into, and stayed in, power through rigged elections. The opposition called on voters to boycott the vote, to take part in civil disobedience and tried to use the Rose Revolution in Georgia as an example.

2500|$|<b>The</b> first <b>president</b> is {{expected}} to [...] "set the job description" [...] for future office holders {{as there is no}} clear idea of how the post would evolve.

However another opinion envisages a more pro-active <b>President</b> within <b>the</b> Union and speaking for it abroad. This post would hence be quickly fashioned into a de facto [...] "President of Europe" [...] and, unlike the first model, would be seen on the world stage as speaking for the EU.

Strangely Neath RFC was not recorded as being present, even though the meeting {{took place in the}} town.

One theory put forward <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>president,</b> John Llewellyn and secretary, Sam Clark of the South Wales Football Union were both Neath men. By attending this new union they would be destroying the SWFU and therefore their own influence in the game. These wounds would soon heal and Neath joined the newly formed WFU in the 1882-83 season and would eventually become pivotal in the union's development, monopolizing the secretaryship from 1896 to 1955.
