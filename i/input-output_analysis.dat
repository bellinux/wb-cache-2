500|$|In 1936, the Russian–born {{economist}} Wassily Leontief {{built his}} model of <b>input-output</b> <b>analysis</b> from the 'material balance' tables constructed by Soviet economists, which themselves followed earlier {{work by the}} physiocrats. [...] With his model, which described a system of production and demand processes, Leontief described how changes in demand in one economic sector would influence production in another. In practice, Leontief [...] estimated the coefficients of his simple models, to address economically interesting questions. [...] In production economics, [...] "Leontief technologies" [...] produce outputs using constant proportions of inputs, regardless {{of the price of}} inputs, reducing the value of Leontief models for understanding economies but allowing their parameters to be estimated relatively easily. In contrast, the von Neumann model of an expanding economy allows for choice of techniques, but the coefficients must be estimated for each technology.|$|E
2500|$|Applied Economics is the {{application}} of economic theory and econometrics in specific settings. As {{one of the two}} sets of fields of economics (the other set being the core), it is typically characterized by {{the application}} of the core, i.e. economic theory and econometrics, to address practical issues in a range of fields including [...] demographic economics, labour economics, business economics, industrial organization, agricultural economics, development economics, education economics, health economics, monetary economics, public economics, and economic history. The process often involves a reduction in the level of abstraction of this core theory. There are a variety of approaches including not only empirical estimation using econometrics, <b>input-output</b> <b>analysis</b> or simulations but also case studies, historical analogy and so-called common sense or the [...] "vernacular". [...] This range of approaches is indicative of what Roger Backhouse and Jeff Biddle argue is the ambiguous nature of the concept of applied economics. It is a concept with multiple meanings. Among broad methodological distinctions, one source places it in neither positive nor normative economics but the art of economics, glossed as [...] "what most economists do".|$|E

For example, the input of wood to a sawmill resulting in outputs from the sawmill may be a direct part of the forestry sector, although it utilizes inputs from other sectors such as energy and transportation. Naturally, other inputs (e.g. labor, water or chemicals) are also needed in these processes (Mattila et al. 2011).|$|R
