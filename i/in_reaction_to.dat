5|$|Characters of Shakespear's Plays is an 1817 book of {{criticism}} of Shakespeare's plays, written by early nineteenth century English essayist and literary critic William Hazlitt. Composed <b>in</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> the neoclassical approach to Shakespeare's plays typified by Samuel Johnson, it {{was among the first}} English-language studies of Shakespeare's plays to follow the manner of German critic August Wilhelm Schlegel, and, with the work of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, {{paved the way for the}} increased appreciation of Shakespeare's genius that was characteristic of later nineteenth-century criticism. It was also the first book to cover all of Shakespeare's plays, intended as a guide for the general reader.|$|E

40|$|Sex {{differences}} <b>in</b> <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> partner infidelity {{have often}} been studied by comparing emotional <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> scenarios of sexual versus emotional infidelity. Men, relative to women, tend to react with more distress to partner sexual infidelity than to emotional infidelity. Evolutionary theorists interpret this difference as evidence of sexually dimorphic selection pressures. In contrast, focusing only on the simple effects within each sex, social-cognitive theorists suggest {{that men and women}} do not differ <b>in</b> their <b>reactions</b> <b>to</b> partner infidelity. As evidenced by recent rival meta-analytic reports, these diverging perspectives remain largely unresolved and contentious. The present study was designed to take a new approach by measuring attitudes toward partner infidelity. Results were consistent with the evolutionary perspective: Men, to a significantly larger degree than women, evaluated partner sexual infidelity more negatively than emotional infidelity...|$|R
5|$|In 270, Zenobia {{launched}} an invasion which brought {{most of the}} Roman East under her sway and culminated with the annexation of Egypt. By mid-271 her realm extended from Ancyra, central Anatolia, to southern Egypt, although she remained nominally subordinate to Rome. However, <b>in</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> Roman emperor Aurelian's campaign in 272, Zenobia declared her son emperor and assumed the title of empress (declaring Palmyra's secession from Rome). The Romans were victorious after heavy fighting; the queen was besieged in her capital and captured by Aurelian, who exiled her to Rome where she spent the remainder of her life.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> left-wing and Basque separatist violence, the {{government}} passed a new anti-terrorist law on 26 August 1975. Sympathising with terrorists would now carry a penalty {{of up to}} 12 years imprisonment. The law re-established military tribunals, empowered to order executions of those they found guilty of terrorism against the state. It extended the time that suspects could be held for interrogation from 3 to 5 days, with an option of up to 19 days with judicial approval. In response, the European Parliament debated a motion proposed by the Confederation of the Socialist Parties of the European Community condemning the new law as an infringement {{of human rights and}} calling for the suspension of relations between the EEC and Spain.|$|E

Militant leader Mahasampo Raveloson was key {{in the creation of the}} party. Other founding members included Philibert Tsiranana (who became Madagascar's first president after independence), Albert Sylla (who became Minister of Foreign Affairs under Tsiranana, and whose son, Jacques Sylla, would go on to become Prime Minister of Madagascar under Marc Ravalomanana), and Pascale Velonjara, father-in-law of future president Didier Ratsiraka.|$|E

The UK Government also closed the international waters loophole via the Marine Broadcasting Offences Act of 1967, although Radio Caroline continued to broadcast (with some sizeable off-air periods between 1968 and 1972 and 1980–83) until 1990.|$|E

5|$|In some rhythm games, {{the screen}} {{displays}} an avatar who performs <b>in</b> <b>reaction</b> <b>to</b> the player's controller inputs. However, these graphical responses are {{usually in the}} background, and the avatar {{is more important to}} spectators than it is to the player. In single-player modes, the player's avatar competes against a computer-controlled opponent, while multiplayer modes allow two player-controlled avatars to compete head-to-head. The popularity of rhythm games has created a market for speciality input devices. These include controllers that emulate musical instruments, such as guitars, drums, or maracas. A dance mat, for use in dancing games, requires the player to step on pressure-sensitive pads. However, most rhythm games also support more conventional input devices, such as control pads.|$|E
