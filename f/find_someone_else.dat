25|$|This poem, {{traditionally}} placed at Amores 3.5, is considered spurious. The poet describes {{a dream to}} an interpreter, saying that he sees while escaping from the heat of noon a white heifer near a bull; when the heifer is pecked by a crow, it leaves the bull for a meadow with other bulls. The interpreter interprets the dream as a love allegory; the bull represents the poet, the heifer a girl, and the crow an old woman. The old woman spurs the girl to leave her lover and <b>find</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else.</b> The poem {{is known to have}} circulated independently and its lack of engagement with Tibullan or Propertian elegy argue in favor of its spuriousness; however, the poem does seem to be datable to the early empire.|$|E

The network {{contacted}} Rick Berman during the [...] of , and informed him that if he didn't develop a new Star Trek show then they would <b>find</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> who would. Berman had previously been an executive producer on Voyager, and other series dating back to The Next Generation.

The new series launched after the end of Voyager, but was set some 150 years before the events seen in The Original Series. The new series was originally called Enterprise, without the Star Trek prefix. UPN president Dean Valentine said that [...] "Paramount felt it was no longer necessary. Enterprise is synonymous with Star Trek". Berman's idea was to set it in an earlier time period, with limited technology such as the ship only being able to travel up to warp 5, as he felt that after three series being set in roughly the same time period it would be exciting for the fans.|$|E

When filling out a rental application he impulsively listed his occupation as [...] "doctor", fearing that the owner might check with Pan Am if he wrote [...] "pilot". After befriending a real doctor {{who lived in the}} same apartment complex, he agreed to act as a supervisor of resident interns as a favor until the local hospital could <b>find</b> <b>someone</b> <b>else</b> to take the job. The position was not difficult for Abagnale because supervisors did no real medical work.
