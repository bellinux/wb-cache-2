40|$|In this study, {{performed}} {{in the western part}} of the state of Paran&# 225;, Brazil, two self-fertile hybrid commercial rapeseed genotypes were evaluated for yield components and physiological quality using three pollination tests and spanning two sowing dates. The treatments consisted of combinations of two rapeseed genotypes (Hyola 61 and Hyola 433), three pollination tests (uncovered area, covered area without insects and covered area containing a single colony of Africanized Apis mellifera honeybees) and two sowing dates (May 25 th, 2011 and June 25 th, 2011). The presence of Africanized honeybees during flowering time increased the productivity of the rapeseed. Losses in the productivity of the hybrids caused by weather conditions unfavorable for rapeseed development were mitigated through cross-pollination performed by the Africanized honeybees. Weather conditions may limit the foraging activity of Africanized honeybees, causing decreased cross-pollination by potential pollinators, especially the Africanized A. mellifera honeybee. The rapeseed hybrids respond differently depending on the sowing date, and the short-cycle Hyola 433 hybrid is the most suitable <b>hybrid</b> <b>for</b> <b>sowing</b> under less favorable weather conditions...|$|R
40|$|Currently, swine {{building}} ventilation {{design is}} based on heat and moisture rates measured in the 1950 s and 1970 s. Advancements in genetics, nutrition and management practices to increase productivity and pork quality during this period likely have led to considerable changes in heat and moisture production rates of the animals and their housing systems. This study quantifies total heat production rate (THP), house-level moisture production rate (MP) and house-level sensible heat production rate (SHP) of a 4300 -sow breeding, gestation, and farrowing facility in Iowa for 17 consecutive months. THP was determined using indirect animal calorimetry, MP was determined from mass balance, and SHP was calculated as the difference between THP and latent heat production (LHP). A Mobile Air Emission Monitoring Unit (MAEMU) was installed to monitor the deep-pit breeding-early gestation barn (1800 head), the deep-pit late gestation barn (1800 head), and two shallow-pit (pull-plug) farrowing rooms (40 head per room). This paper reports on data collected from February 2012 through {{the completion of the}} study in June 2013. Preliminary results from the study show that THP averages 373 W/sow <b>for</b> <b>sows</b> in the breeding/early gestation stage, 376 W/sow <b>for</b> <b>sows</b> in the late gestation stage, and 1191 W/sow+litter <b>for</b> <b>sows</b> and litters in the lactation stage. The house-level MP averages 198 g/hr-sow <b>for</b> <b>sows</b> in the breeding/early gestation stage, 192 g/hr-sow <b>for</b> <b>sows</b> in the late gestation stage, 818 g/hr-sow <b>for</b> <b>sows</b> and litters in the lactation stage. Finally the house-level SHP averages 223 W/sow <b>for</b> <b>sows</b> in the breeding/early gestation stage, 230 W/sow <b>for</b> <b>sows</b> in the late gestation stage, and 572 W/sow <b>for</b> <b>sows</b> and litters in the lactation stage. Compared with the ASABE standards, values from the current study <b>for</b> gestation <b>sows</b> showed increases of 55 % in THP, 20 % in MP, and 58 % in SHP. Similarly, values <b>for</b> farrowing <b>sow</b> and litter showed increases of 85 % in THP, 64 % in MP, and 80 % in SHP relative to the ASABE standards...|$|R

The bachelor dissertation results in low share of areas of reproduction in comparision with the total area of arable soil in ecological agriculture. It is related to insufficient proposal of bioquality seeds in the Czech Republic, for example in comparison with neighbouring Austria.

40|$|Over the 2013 / 2014 {{growing season}} a Camelina growth trial was {{undertaken}} at Ashley Dene, Canterbury, New Zealand {{to determine the}} response to different sowing dates, sowing rates {{and the application of}} plant growth regulators. This was done to analyse how the crop grows and develops in New Zealand conditions and the effect that agronomic mangement has. There were three sowing dates spread out over the spring period and three different sowing rates 2, 4 and 6 kg ha⁻¹ of 'Calena' and a treatment of 1 L/ha Cycocel® plant growth regular was applied to half the subplots. Emergence, plant populations, plant characteristics, growth stages, biomass yields, seed yields, weed yields and oil content was measured. It was clear from emergence counts that there was significant seedling deaths <b>for</b> <b>sowing</b> date one and two with maximum survival being 31 % and 56 % respectively, compared to a minimum of 96 % <b>for</b> <b>sowing</b> date three and this was attributed to herbicide interaction with cold temperatures. Consequently seed yield was highest <b>for</b> <b>sowing</b> date 3 on 1211 kg ha⁻¹ compared to 883 kg ha⁻¹ and 577 kg ha⁻¹ <b>for</b> <b>sowing</b> date one and two. However despite the significant population decrease sowing date one and three had similar biomass yields. Sowing rate interactions however were consistent and seed yield, biomass and density all increased with increasing sowing rate. Plant growth regulators only effected plant height and were unnecessary as there was no lodging observed. This experiment proved that sowing date has more effect on biomass yield than sowing rate and lodging is not a significant issue in Camelina. It also proved how sensitive Camelina is to herbicide damage...|$|R

The lack {{of significance}} in the trend <b>for</b> the <b>sowing</b> date of wheat in DH probably is due to limited machinability in late summer/early fall caused by water-saturated soils [16].

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the paper is to {{presents}} two <b>sowing</b> machines <b>for</b> interval <b>sowing,</b> differing {{in the mode of}} operation. We were interested in adequacy of sowing at different working speeds of the pneumatic vacuum sowing machine OLT and the pneumatic pressure sowing machine Aeromat - Becker <b>for</b> <b>sowing</b> sugar beet. The goal of the paper is to find out the optimum working speed <b>for</b> the individual <b>sowing</b> machine. Design/methodology/approach: : In completely identical conditions at different speeds of sowing two sowing machines which are most widely used in Slovenia were tested. Findings: We measured and calculated the parameters such as working efficiency, depth of sowing, inter - row distance and distance between seeds in the sowing row. Research limitations/implications: <b>For</b> successful <b>sowing</b> it is necessary to know adequacy of the soil <b>for</b> <b>sowing,</b> technical properties of the sowing machine and biotechnical characteristics of the seed. Cultivation of sugar beet depends primarily on expert and technically correct <b>sowing.</b> <b>For</b> growth and normal development of plants the distance between seeds in the sowing row is the most important parameter. Practical implications: Expertly performed sowing and sowing machines are of great importance for cultivation of sugar beet. The tests were aimed at defining the most suitable <b>sowing</b> speed <b>for</b> both <b>sowing</b> machines on the basis of measured data. The principal aim of the paper is to establish whether the higher working speed influences the quality of sowing. It is very important for the producers to be well familiarized with all agro - technical measures because cultivation of sugar beet requires much money invested and work performed per unit of area. Originality/value: : The optimum sowing speed of the pneumatic vacuum machine OLT is 8 km/h and the optimum sowing speed of the pneumatic pressure sowing machine Aeromat - Becker is 10 km/h...|$|R
