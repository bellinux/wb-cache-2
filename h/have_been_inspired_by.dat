5|$|Arundel's {{body was}} {{initially}} interred at the Franciscan church in Hereford.

5|$|Caesar's and Guy's Towers are {{residential}} and may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>inspired</b> <b>by</b> French models (for example Bricquebec).

Caesar's Tower contained a grim basement dungeon; {{according to local}} legend dating back to at least 1644 it {{is also known as}} Poitiers Tower, either because prisoners from the Battle of Poitiers in 1356 may have been imprisoned there, or because the ransoms raised from the battle helped to pay for its construction. The gatehouse features murder holes, two drawbridges, a gate, and portcullises– gates made from wood or metal. The towers of the gatehouse were machicolated.|$|E
5|$|Happy Brothers, Their Poor Mother! (often {{referred}} to simply as Happy Brothers) is an 1887 oil painting by the Serbian artist Uroš Predić.

Predić painted the composition hoping it would persuade the villagers to change their ways. He was disappointed that it not only failed to decrease the incidence of drunkenness in Orlovat, but was well received by the villagers themselves, who were happy merely to have been depicted.|$|E

5|$|Peveril of the Peak (1823) by Sir Walter Scott is a {{historical}} novel set at Peveril Castle, Castleton {{during the reign of}} Charles II. William Wordsworth was a frequent visitor to Matlock; the Peak inspired several of his poems, including an 1830 sonnet to Chatsworth House.

Snowfield in George Eliot's first novel Adam Bede (1859) is believed to be based on Wirksworth, where her uncle managed a mill; Ellastone (as Hayslope) and Ashbourne (as Oakbourne) are also featured.|$|E
5|$|The architects in the Karnataka region seem to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>inspired</b> <b>by</b> {{architectural}} {{developments in}} northern India. This {{is evidenced by}} the fact that they incorporated decorative miniature towers (multi-aedicular towers depicting superstructures) of the Sekhari and Bhumija types, supported on pilasters, almost simultaneously with these developments in the temples in northern India. The miniature towers represented shrines, which in turn represented deities. Sculptural depictions of deities were generally discreet although not uncommon. Other northern ideas they incorporated were the pillar bodies that appeared as wall projections. Well-known constructions incorporating these features are found at the Kasivisvesvara Temple and the Nannesvara Temple, both at Lakkundi.|$|E
5|$|The design may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>inspired</b> <b>by</b> {{the death}} in 1792 of Hugh Munro, son of General Sir Hector Munro, who had {{commanded}} a division during Sir Eyre Coote's {{victory at the}} Battle of Porto Novo (Parangipettai) in 1781 when Hyder Ali, Tipu Sultan's father, was defeated {{with a loss of}} 10,000 men during the Second Anglo-Mysore War. Hugh Munro, a civilian visiting India, was attacked and killed by a tiger on 22 December 1792 while hunting with several companions on Saugor Island in the Bay of Bengal (still one of the last refuges of the Bengal tiger).|$|E
