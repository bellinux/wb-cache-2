5|$|Generally, both {{conversation}} and reading involve {{at least one}} of the four principles of context that are used <b>in</b> <b>word</b> learning and vocabulary development: physical context, prior knowledge, social context and semantic support.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to {{conversations and}} {{engaging}} in conversation with others help school-age children develop vocabulary. Fast mapping {{is the process of}} learning a new concept upon a single exposure and is used <b>in</b> <b>word</b> learning not only by infants and toddlers, but by preschool children and adults as well. This principle is very useful for word learning in conversational settings, as words tend not to be explained explicitly in conversation, but may be referred to frequently throughout the span of a conversation.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>word</b> learning, {{the mapping}} problem {{refers to the}} {{question}} of how infants attach the forms of language to the things that they experience in the world. There are infinite objects, concepts, and actions in the world that words could be mapped onto. Many theories have been proposed to account for the way in which the language learner successfully maps words onto the correct objects, concepts, and actions.|$|E

5|$|Ottawa {{is one of}} the Ojibwe dialects {{that has}} {{undergone}} the most language change, although it shares many features with other dialects. The most distinctive change is a pervasive pattern of vowel syncope that deletes short vowels in many words, resulting in significant changes in their pronunciation. This and other innovations in pronunciation, in addition to changes <b>in</b> <b>word</b> structure and vocabulary, differentiate Ottawa from other dialects of Ojibwe.|$|E
5|$|The cervix was {{documented}} in anatomical literature {{in at least}} the time of Hippocrates; cervical cancer was first described more than 2,000 years ago, with descriptions provided by both Hippocrates and Aretaeus. However, there was some variation <b>in</b> <b>word</b> sense among early writers, who used the term to refer to both the cervix and the internal uterine orifice. The first attested {{use of the word}} to refer to the cervix of the uterus was in 1702.|$|E
5|$|An infant's social {{environment}} relates {{to his or}} her later language development. Children's first words are closely linked to their early language experience. For children with typically developing language skills, there is a close match between maternal speech and their environment: up to 78% of maternal speech is matched to the object the child is focusing on. In children with delayed language development, only 50% of maternal speech is matched to the object the infant is focusing on. Infants are {{more likely to engage in}} joint attention when the parent talks about an object that the child is attending to as opposed to an object outside of the infant's attention. This increased level of joint attention aids in encouraging normal language development, including word comprehension and production. When joint attention is present, it plays an important role <b>in</b> <b>word</b> learning, a crucial aspect of language development.|$|E

5|$|Infants {{use words}} to {{communicate}} {{early in life}} and their communication skills develop as they grow older. Communication skills aid <b>in</b> <b>word</b> learning. Infants learn to take turns while communicating with adults. While preschoolers lack precise timing and rely on obvious speaker cues, older children are more precise in their timing and take fewer long pauses. Children get better at initiating and sustaining coherent conversations as they age. Toddlers and preschoolers use strategies such as repeating and recasting their partners' utterances to keep the conversation going. Older children add new relevant information to conversations. Connectives such as then, so, and because are more frequently used as children get older. When giving and responding to feedback, preschoolers are inconsistent, but around the age of six, children can mark corrections with phrases and head nods to indicate their continued attention. As children continue to age they provide more constructive interpretations back to listeners, which helps prompt conversations.|$|E
5|$|Thereafter, despite {{changing}} musical trends, Peerson's music {{showed significant}} roots in Renaissance polyphony. However, he was adept {{in the use}} of then-modern compositional procedures; this is evident in his often daring use of chromaticism, especially seen <b>in</b> <b>word</b> painting. Some of his finest music is contained in his set of 15 Latin motets, which was probably composed {{around the turn of the}} century. Existing only in a single copy, it originally consisted of five part-books but the Cantus book is lost. Richard Rastall, professor of historical musicology at the University of Leeds, spent 12 years reconstructing the missing part. The complete Latin motets have been published by Antico Edition, and a recording of their performance by Ex Cathedra entitled Peerson: Latin Motets was produced by Hyperion Records in 2005.|$|E

40|$|Abstract : This {{study is}} {{conducted}} {{to provide support}} for the prediction that familiarity of <b>words</b> <b>in</b> contexts affects the degree of hyper/hypo-articulation of vowels <b>in</b> these <b>words.</b> Results from the present analysis show that the repetition of <b>words</b> <b>in</b> a story causes hypoarticulation of vowels <b>in</b> these <b>words.</b> Among the eight types of vowels whose F 1 and F 2 values are measured, two types of vowels <b>in</b> <b>words</b> that come {{for the second time}} in a context show hypoarticulation to a much higher degree than those <b>in</b> <b>words</b> that come for the first time. One type of vowel <b>in</b> the <b>words</b> that come for the second time shows more partial hypoarticulation than that <b>in</b> the <b>words</b> that come for the first time. Three types of vowels show almost the same F 1 and F 2 values in both cases. A vowel space with four corner vowels <b>in</b> the <b>words</b> that come for the second time is smaller than that <b>in</b> <b>words</b> that come for the first time, which also indicates a tendency toward hypoarticulation for vowels <b>in</b> <b>words</b> repeated after their first introduction. 　　Keywords: formant, hypoarticulation, repetition, space, vowe...|$|R
