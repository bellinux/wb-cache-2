40|$|Chagas Disease impacts {{millions}} of people in South and Central America and yet it remains a mostly unheard of disease outside its area of influence. The Center of Disease Control refers to Chagas Disease as one of the primary “neglected” diseases of the world (CDC, 2013). This parasitic disease is spread primarily through the feces of blood sucking insects of the Triatominae subfamily, also known as “kissing bugs”. When the <b>insect</b> <b>drops</b> its feces, a vertebrate host can transfer the parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi), into the bloodstream, i. e. via the eyes, mouth, or open wounds, and become infected. In this honors thesis, a susceptible, infected and removed/resistant (SIR) model of disease transmission at the household level was developed. The model is replicated and parameterized with geospatial survey data for all households within a town. In addition, a logistic regression analysis was performed on all the household survey data collected in Guayabo and Chiquimula, Guatemala to identify parameters of importance (p 3 ̆c 0. 10) to infested houses (i. e. the presence of insects collected in a household and the presence of insect evidence within a household). Eventually the individual household models will be linked for the purpose of modeling the disease transmission between houses at the town scale. The latter will enable better insect and disease control mitigation strategies...|$|R

Stocked trout grew rapidly in the lake, and before other species began competing successfully with trout, anglers caught 10 lb rainbows regularly, and the average catch weighed more than 1 lb. However, in 1992 a non-native species, tui chub, was detected in the lake. These fish, illegally introduced to the lake, quickly multiplied and negatively affected the sport fishery.

When stretched to large extensional strains, beads-on-a-string type morphologies develop and remain frozen in place, presumably due to the combined effects of extensional strain stiffening and drying. More generally, we demonstrate how the rheological material functions of microscopic biopolymer samples in the sub-nanolitre range can be measured using an interferometry-based microrheometer for shear deformations and a capillary thinning microrheometer for extensional deformations. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Fisheries, 1969 Because stream {{fisheries}} are {{so closely}} associated with forested watersheds, {{it is necessary that}} the streams and forests be managed jointly under a system of multiple use.

It is {{the purpose of this paper}} to relate logging practices to fish management by ascertaining the effect of logging-road construction on the <b>drop</b> of <b>insects</b> into a stream. On the South Fork of Caspar Creek the insects falling into the stream were greatly increased after a logging road was built. A twofold increase in number and weight of insects occurred over the entire stream. In "Disturbed" areas, where the road paralleled the stream, <b>drop</b> <b>insects</b> increased three and one half times by number and one and one half times by weight over the "Insect-Control" area. In the "Highly Disturbed" areas, where the road crossed the stream, insect numbers increased by five and one half times and a threefold increase by weight over the "Insect-Control" area was noted. A more than proportionate amount of the increase occurred in those adult insects having aquatic immature stages. One such family, Chironomidae, had a greater occurrence after road construction than all insects combined before construction. This family showed the most significant change of the families studied...|$|R
40|$|The whitefly, Bemisia tabaci from Homoptera order, {{has been}} a problem in chili {{cultivation}} for years. Insecticides have been and will likely remain the best alternative {{that can be used to}} solve whitefly infestation problem. The study was conducted to determine the efficacy of several insecticides against whitefly on chili plant (Capsicum annuum) from 'Kulai' 0630 cultivation in Malaysia. All management procedures are conducted as usual to imitate commercial plantation. The insecticides used in this study are Imidacloprid (Confidor 200 SL) and Dinotefuran (Oshin 20 WP). The effectiveness of each insecticide used being evaluated in term of the number of pest present on the crop plant before and after the application of insecticide. This experiment is conducted by using randomized completely block design (RCBD) with 3 treatments and 4 blocks/replications for each treatment amounting to 12 plot altogether. Each plot will be provided with 10 experimental units. Therefore, the total numbers of experimental units are 120 plants. From each sampling, only five leaves are taken from the middle level randomly, and there will be 600 ample from 10 times sampling. Sampling are done on the day prior the treatment, the day after treatment, then on day 3, 7 and 14 after treatment. Treatment are done twice, on day 75 after sowing and day 90 after sowing. The treatments used untreated water as a control. The control plot shown a linear reduction in the whitefly population mean from 5. 5 to 2. 5 for the first treatment. In plot treated with Imidac 1 oprid, the population mean of <b>insect</b> pest <b>drop</b> from 6. 75 to 3 in the first day, and remain the same (1. 75) for the three consecutive data collection day. Plot treated with Dinotefuran show a reduction from 5. 75 before treatment to 3. 75 on the first day and continue to drop in the third day to only 1. 5. However from day 7 it start to rise back to 2. 25 and 2. 75 on the last day. In the second application, the mean number of insect pest also recorded to drop after treatment. In the control plot, <b>insect</b> population mean <b>drop</b> from 3 to 2. 5 after treatment, continue to drop to 2. 25 on the third day but rise up in the seventh day to 2. 75, and 3 on the last day. A nearly same pattern is observed plot treated with Dinotefuran, drop down from 2. 75 to 2 after treatment, and continue to drop to 1. 5 in the third day and rise up to 1. 75 on seventh day, thus remain the same till the end of the experiment. Imidac 10 prid had cause the insect population to decrease after treatment, from 2. 25 to 1. 25, however its number remain the same and only rise up again on the last day of the data collection to 1. 5. The result obtained from this experiment had proved that chemical treatment can be used to control the population of insect pest, Bemisia tabaci as there is a reduction in the population of insect pest in the treated plot. Imidac 10 prid showed that it is more significant than Dinotefuran in controlling the population number of whitefly on chilly crop, provided the application must not be continuous. It have to be alternated with other pesticides with different mode of action, or else the whitefly may built resistant toward Imidac 1 oprid. Dinotefuran in the other hand are able to control the pest population in long term, however, as chilly usually grown as annual crop, Dinotefuran are not affective enough to control the pest population in limited time interval...|$|R
40|$|Bryophytes {{have until}} now been absent from all {{hypotheses}} regarding {{the origin of}} insect pollination of seed plants. The discovery that both springtails and mites are able to transfer sperm in mosses {{makes it possible to}} suggest a ’Bryophyte precursor hypothesis of plant pollination’ stating that animal-mediated fertilization in mosses and insect pollination in seed plants is historically linked by homologous or analogous evolution of structures responsible for attraction and reward aimed at a pool of fertilization vectors originally co-evolved with bryophytes and subsequently co-opted by seed plants. The earliest point in time when animal-mediated fertilization of bryophytes, involving springtails and mites, could have arisen is Late Silurian/Early Devonian, ca 280 Myr before the evolutionary radiation of angiosperms. Soil-dwelling microarthropods and wingless insects are assumed to have been the primary vectors transporting sperm in ancient mosses and possibly other groups of bryophytes. These animals may later have secondarily expanded to transfer pollen in gymnosperms and angiosperms, similar to the frequent pollinator shifts observed among angiosperm groups. Several ancestral traits pointed out by recent studies of early angiosperms are in favour of this hypothesis, such as small size of flowers, small and non-sticky pollen, adaptations for growth in moist and shaded habitats close to running water, and weedy growth forms with rapid life-cycles in disturbed habitats. It is also possible to envisage a link from sexual attractants excreted by oogonia in charophyte algae and archegonia in bryophytes to guide sperm, via sugar released to attract <b>insects</b> in pollination <b>drop</b> mechanisms in gymnosperms to more advanced structures specialized for insect attraction such as nectaries and nectar discs in angiosperms...|$|R
40|$|Culicoides spp. (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) are {{the main}} vectors of Bluetongue and Schmallenberg virus disease, which are {{infectious}} diseases of ruminants. Recently, both viral diseases occurred {{for the first time}} in Germany and caused substantial suffering and large economic losses, primarily in sheep flocks. None of the currently available insecticides is registered to control infestations with Culicoides midges in ruminants. This study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of a pour on formulation of a deltamethrin preparation (Butox® 7. 5 mg/ml pour on, MSD Tiergesundheit Germany) against midges in sheep. In a double blind study, a two hectare pasture in Gross Kreutz (Brandenburg) was divided by electric fences into two parts. A double fence formed a 2 m wide corridor, ensuring that contact between the two sheep flocks was prevented. Each pasture housed a group (A, B) of 20 female Merino sheep with approximately 40 kg body weight. The treatment groups were treated with 10 ml Butox® 7. 5 mg/ml pour on during five consecutive days. For this purpose, the respective subgroup (A 1 -A 5, B 1 -B 5) of three sheep plus one spare sheep was separated from the main group for 24 hours in an extra fenced section of the pasture to prevent the carry-over contamination of the veterinary product to untreated sheep. The treatment area was equipped with a calf igloo to protect the treated sheep against rainfall and a potential washing out of the insecticide. Sheep of the control group received a similar treatment, but were not treated with Butox® 7. 5 mg/ml pour on. The midge catches were carried out on day 1, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35 after the initial treatment, each time within a time window of 2 hours before to 2 hours after sunset. For the midge collections, a subgroup of three sheep was led inside a crush pen which was located under a 3 x 3 m marquee (drop trap). All four side walls of the drop trap could be raised and fastened or quickly dropped. The sheep were kept in the drop trap for 15 minutes with the walls raised, followed by 20 minutes under the closed drop trap with the walls dropped. With the aid of an aspirator, all <b>insects</b> inside the <b>drop</b> trap were collected from the tent walls and the ceiling for 15 min. A single collection took about 1 hour in total, allowing four catches on one evening. Collections were not made on days with rainfall, temperatures below 10 °C or wind speed above 5 m/s. A calculation of the efficacy of the insecticide was made by comparing the total number of collected midges and the total number of collected engorged midges from the treatment and from the control group. During the field study of six weeks, a total of 19, 057 midges were caught on 22 catching days in both groups. 7, 026 midges were caught in the treatment group, with 103 engorged midges (1. 47 %). In the control group, 12, 034 midges were caught, including 757 engorged midges (6. 29 %). The midges belonged to the subspecies Avaritia Fox (86, 62 %) or Culicoides Latreille (13, 38 %). The catches on day 1 and 35 after the treatment showed no substantial differences between both groups. Significant differences regarding the number of engorged midges were observed from day 7 to day 28 between the treatment group and the control group. The total number of midges collected in the treated group on day 7, 21 and 28 after treatment was lower in comparison to the control group. The Butox® 7. 5 mg/ml treatment effectively reduced the number of engorged midges by 86. 39 %, and the total number of midges by 41. 47 % over the entire study period. These results show a high efficacy of Butox® 7. 5 mg/ml pour on against midges infesting sheep. The pour on treatment of sheep with Butox® 7. 5 mg/ml may be useful during outbreaks of animal diseases associated with midges. Additional safety measures should be implemented for an increased protection of the animals...|$|R
