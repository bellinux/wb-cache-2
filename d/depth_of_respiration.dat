The chief side effect of overdosage of ethamivan was muscular twitching. This did not prove to be a problem and was of some value in determining the amount of drug given. The nine patients survived.

Compressive forces of hydrostatic pressure combine with deep relaxation to enhance functioning of the lymphatic system and reduce swelling in cases of edema. For orthopedic impairments, combined effects of relaxation, warm water, and gentle movement decreases muscle spasm, provides pain relief, improves soft tissue mobility, and increases range of motion. The rhythmic rocking motions combined with repeated trunk rotation and elongation relaxes muscles and improves mobility.|$|E

40|$|Oceanic <b>depth</b> {{profiles}} <b>of</b> plankton <b>respiration</b> {{are described}} by a power function, R CO 2 = (R CO 2) 0 (z/z 0) b, similar to the vertical carbon flux profile. Furthermore, because both ocean processes are closely related, conceptually and mathematically, each can be calculated from the other. The exponent b, always negative, defines the maximum curvature of the respiration–depth profile and controls the carbon flux. When |b| is large, the carbon flux (F C) from the epipelagic ocean is low and the nutrient retention efficiency (NRE) is high, allowing these waters to maintain high productivity. The opposite occurs when |b| is small. This means that the attenuation <b>of</b> <b>respiration</b> in ocean water columns is critical in understanding and predicting both vertical F C {{as well as the}} capacity of epipelagic ecosystems to retain their nutrients. The ratio of seawater R CO 2 to incoming F C is the NRE, a new metric that represents nutrient regeneration in a seawater layer in reference to the nutrients introduced into that layer via F C. A <b>depth</b> profile <b>of</b> F C is the integral <b>of</b> water column <b>respiration.</b> This relationship facilitates calculating ocean sections of F C from water column respiration. In an F C section and in a NRE section across the Peruvian upwelling system we found an F C maximum and a NRE minimum extending down to 400 m, 50 km off the Peruvian coast over {{the upper part of the}} continental slope. Finally, considering the coupling between respiratory electron transport system activity and heterotrophic oxidative phosphorylation promoted the calculation of an ocean section of heterotrophic energy production (HEP).

Here I {{synthesize}} {{the results}} of several types of measurements <b>of</b> organic carbon <b>respiration</b> and calcium carbonate dissolution rates in pelagic seafloor sediments. Measurements of pore water oxygen demonstrate that most <b>of</b> the <b>respiration</b> takes place very near the sediment-water interface, with a scale <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> a few millimeters. The remainder <b>of</b> the oxic <b>respiration</b> occurs much deeper in the sediments, with a scale <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> several centimeters. All measures <b>of</b> <b>respiration</b> from locations as disparate as the tropical Pacific and Atlantic, and the subtropical North Atlantic agree that pelagic seafloor rates <b>of</b> oxic <b>respiration</b> <b>of</b> organic carbon are relatively independent <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> and location, {{with the exception of}} sediments beneath the Pacific eastern equatorial upwelling zone. Calcite dissolution in seafloor sediments requires forcing by respiration-produced CO₂, and rates are consistent with a first-order dependence on pore water undersaturation, solubility as determined by Mucci [1983] at atmospheric pressure, and locally variable mass-specific dissolution rate constants. Respiration-driven calcite dissolution fluxes predicted by this combination <b>of</b> <b>respiration</b> and dissolution rate expressions are significantly lower than many previous estimates. Comparison of dissolution fluxes in the oligotrophic open ocean measured by other researchers with benthic chamber incubation techniques with those predicted by this combination of rate expressions is, within stated uncertainties, in agreement in all but one case, questioning the need for complicated mechanisms such as surface buffering or authigenic precipitation to explain seafloor calcite diagenesis. Applying these kinetics to a simple one-dimensional, steady state model of the bulk calcite content and sediment accumulation rates of the sediment mixed layer yields results consistent with observations of the seafloor lysocline, the region of transition from high calcite to low-calcite sediments, on the Ceara Rise in the western tropical North Atlantic and the Ontong-Java Plateau in the western equatorial Pacific. Scenarios ignoring dissolution driven by respiration-produced CO₂ in pore waters and using the high-order dependence on undersaturation and very large dissolution rate constants implied by some earlier laboratory studies do not simulate these observations. While the scheme represented here does, in fact, imply a strong shift in the locus of carbonate dissolution toward the sediment water interface as bottomwater saturation decreases, as implied by the observations of Martin et al. [2000], no simple combination of sediment transport coefficients and reaction kinetics can reproduce the observation of increasing ¹⁴C age as dissolution progresses. These results emphasize the importance of accurate knowledge of the kinetics <b>of</b> <b>respiration</b> and dissolution to interpretation of either the present-day or paleolysocline...|$|R

They play a part in the variations of systolic and diastolic pressures, the relative importance of which depends on the degree of arhythmia present and on the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>respiration</b> which, in itself, causes the systolic and diastolic pressures to decrease during inspiration and increase during expiration. No degree of rate variation can be regarded as a type. The cases range from those in which respiration governs the change of pressures entirely through those where more or less complicated mixtures of heart rate and respiratory influences intermingle to those in which extreme cardiac variations alone determine the pressure changes. The emphatic insistence of Henderson and his collaborators that heart rate changes play a more important part than is commonly recognized in man is true in many cases. That, in certain cases, it is the only determining influence may also be admitted, but they are in the minority. The majority show the intervention of a respiratory influence which controls, at least, the variations of systolic pressure.

In this report, a model of the closed human cardiovascular loop is developed. This model, using one set of 88 equations, allows variations from normal resting conditions to exercise, {{as well as to the}} ultimate condition of a circulation following cardiac arrest. The principal purpose of the model is to evaluate the continuum of physiological conditions to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) effects within the circulation.

The model also demonstrates the limitations to cardiopulmonary resuscitation caused by external force applied to intrathoracic structures, with effective cardiac output being limited by collapse and sloshing.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{foundations}} upon which our present knowledge of the regulation of respiration is built {{is the fact that}} carbon dioxide is the physiological stimulus of the respiratory center. It has been shown beyond doubting that in mammals and reptiles, and also in birds (Stehlik, 1922), the raised CO 2 tension in the blood increases both the rate and <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>respiration.</b> There is no doubt that in all these cases it is the increase of the CO 2 con-tent of the blood and not the lack of oxygen which serves as the physiological stimulus to the respiratory center. Another physiologically interesting fact was described by Huxley in 1913, namely, that straightening the neck, or dorsi-flexion of the head upon the neck, produces apnea in the duck, and also, as it was later shown, in other diving birds. This cessation of respiration was shown to be a postural reflex, for extirpation of the labyrinths or section of the cervical roots prevents the production of apnea. These two facts may seem to be entirely unrelated, yet if one considers the stimulating effect of CO 2 on the respiratory center, it is hard to understand why this stimulation does not overcome the apnea-producing reflex. In many cases ducks can actually be killed by postural apneas of long duration (ten to twenty-five minutes). (Kopp#{ 225 }nyi and Kleitman, 1927.)

The soil <b>respiration</b> <b>of</b> C. korshinkii achieved their peak values in July or August. The maximum soil <b>respiration</b> <b>of</b> Salix psammophila was observed in August. Soil temperature could better explain seasonal changes <b>of</b> soil <b>respiration</b> <b>of</b> C. korshinkii, whereas soil water content could better explain seasonal changes <b>of</b> soil <b>respiration</b> <b>of</b> Salix psammophila. The relationship between soil respiration and soil temperature was better expressed by an exponential function under different site conditions. The Q 10 <b>of</b> soil <b>respiration</b> was larger in silt loam soil than in sandy soil. This showed that the soil <b>respiration</b> <b>of</b> silt loam soil was more sensitive to soil temperature...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was the study <b>of</b> <b>respiration</b> in ocean margin sediments and the {{assessments}} of tools needed for this purpose. The first study was on the biological pump and global respiration patterns in the deep ocean using an empirical model based on sediment oxygen consumption data. In this thesis the <b>depth</b> dependence <b>of</b> <b>respiration</b> patterns was modelled using a compiled data set of sediment oxygen consumption rates. We showed that the depth relationship {{can best be described}} by a double exponential model. By assuming a uniform flux laterally across the global ocean the <b>depth</b> attenuation <b>of</b> POC could be derived. The results from this study imply a more efficient biological pump. The second study was on the short-term fate of phytodetritus, investigated across the Pakistan margin of the Arabian Sea. Stations ranged in water depths from 140 to 1850 m, encompassing the oxygen minimum zone. Phytodetritus sedimentation events were simulated by adding 13 C-labelled algal material to surface sediments. The labelled carbon was subsequently traced into bacterial lipids as a proxy of bacterial biomass, foraminiferan and macrofaunal biomass as well as into dissolved organic and inorganic pools. The largest pool of processed carbon was found in dissolved inorganic carbon, attributed to respiration. Macrofaunal influence was most pronounced at {{the lower part of the}} oxygen minimum zone. The third study was on benthic respiration rates in the Gulf of Finland, Baltic Sea. Rates were based on in situ incubations using benthic chamber landers. Three contrasting stations with different sediment accumulation regimes were visited. The effect of changes in water masses on the benthic fluxes was investigated with a dynamic diagenetic model. Fluxes of dissolved inorganic carbon were highest at the station with accumulation bottom, intermediate at the station with transport bottom and lowest at the station with erosion sediments. The fourth study was primarily a theoretical investigation of how well a certain model parameter can be constrained based on a certain dataset. A model of bio-irrigation was used as a good example of this. The interpretation is based on fitting observed data with a model containing several parameters, where some parameters are a priori unknown. In this chapter, it was tested under what conditions the results obtained through this fitting are robust. The results from this study imply that using only the concentration change in the overlying water, it is not possible to constrain both the rate and the mechanism of bio-irrigation, thus, sampling the porewaters at the end of the incubation is a necessity. The fifth study was an an evaluation of the performance of an oxygen optode. The performance of the sensor was evaluated and compared with data obtained by other methods. The principal conclusion was that, owing to high accuracy, long-term stability (more than 20 months), lack of pressure hysteresis and limited cross-sensitivity, this method is overall more suitable for oxygen monitoring in the aquatic environment than other methods...|$|R
