5|$|Aspinall {{was born}} in Prestatyn, North Wales, after {{his mother had been}} {{evacuated}} from the family home in Liverpool because of the air-raids on Liverpool during the Second World War, while Aspinall's father was away at sea with the Royal Navy. Aspinall and his mother returned to Liverpool later in 1942 after the bombing had subsided. Aspinall later attended West Derby School, where he passed his 11-Plus exams. When he was twelve years old, Aspinall gained a place at the Liverpool Institute in Mount Street, and was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>class</b> as Paul McCartney for English and Art lessons.|$|E
5|$|At the time, Pratt & Whitney {{dominated}} the commercial market. GE needed an engine {{in this market}} class, and SNECMA had previous experience of working with them, collaborating on {{the production of the}} CF6-50 turbofan for the Airbus A300. Pratt & Whitney was considering upgrading their JT8D to compete <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>class</b> as the CFM56 as a sole venture, while Rolls-Royce dealt with financial issues that precluded them from starting new projects; this situation caused GE to gain the title of best partner for the program.|$|E
5|$|Lody {{was further}} memorialised in 1937 when the newly {{launched}} destroyer Z10 was christened Hans Lody.

The ship served throughout the Second World War in the Baltic and North Sea theatres, survived the war and was captured by the British in 1945. After a few years in Royal Navy service she was scrapped in Sunderland in 1949.|$|E

5|$|Several {{locomotives}} {{have been}} given the name Great Western. The first was an Iron Duke class broad-gauge locomotive built in 1846, the first locomotive entirely constructed at the company's Swindon locomotive works. This was withdrawn in 1870, but in 1888 a newly built locomotive <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>class</b> was given the same name; this was withdrawn four years later when the broad gauge was taken out of use. A standard-gauge 3031 class locomotive, number 3012, was then given the name. The last GWR locomotive to carry the name was Castle class number 7007, which continued to carry it in British Railways days.|$|E
5|$|The Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions {{encouraged}} its 800,000 {{members to}} not fly with Braathens {{due to the}} introduction of a segregated classes. SAS did not follow the same policy, and offered its discounted customers to travel <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>class</b> as Braathens', including complimentary service. After introduction, the concept increased the work load on handing employees, who needed to check the passengers' tickets to ensure they sat in the right class. There were also complaints from Best-passengers who felt that they were receiving worse service after the scheme was introduced.|$|E

He {{was one of the}} founders of the American Whig Society, along with Brackenridge, Madison, Samuel Stanhope Smith, Bedford, Freneau, John Beatty, John Henry of Maryland, and William Bradford. McKnight studied medicine and surgery privately with eminent Philadelphia surgeon William Shippen, but left before he completed his studies and entered the Continental Army in 1775.|$|E

40|$|Closed {{hyperbolic}} manifolds {{are proven}} to minimize volume over all Alexandrov spaces with curvature bounded below by - 1 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> bilipschitz <b>class.</b> As a corollary compact convex cores with totally geodesic boundary are proven to minimize volume over all hyperbolic manifolds <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> bilipschitz <b>class.</b> Also, closed hyperbolic manifolds minimize volume over all hyperbolic cone manifolds <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> bilipschitz <b>class</b> with cone angles not greater than 2 pi. The proof uses techniques developed by Besson-Courtois-Gallot. In 3 dimensions, this result provides a partial {{solution to a}} conjecture in Kleinian groups concerning acylindrical manifolds.

5|$|Evolve {{features}} {{a total of}} 20 different human characters split into four classes, each class containing 5 characters. Each class has different skills and abilities, and players are required to cooperate {{with each other in}} a match. Players unlock new characters as they progress through the game, e.g. the fourth Assault character will be unlocked if the player has upgraded the previous three Assault characters. The Hunters class features first-person gameplay. The ammunition of their weapons is automatically refilled when not in use, and iron sights are used in- game. Evolve does not allow multiple players to play as the same class in a match. Gameplay variations are also present within the characters <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>class.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} the test {{is to ensure that}} the right to equal {{protection}} is upheld by guarding against three forms of arbitrariness. First, individuals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>class</b> must share common features and should not be classified arbitrarily. Secondly, the treatment of persons falling within the same class must not be arbitrary. Lastly, the basis of classification must not be arbitrary but should bear a reasonable relationship to the object of the executive action. The stages of the rational nexus test directly address these forms of arbitrariness. As such, a law that satisfies all the stages of the test will be found to be valid and constitutional.|$|E
5|$|While in college, West {{hoped to}} play both {{baseball}} and football. However, spring practice for football interfered with West's {{ability to be}} on the baseball team as well. He concentrated on football and umpired high school baseball games on the side. In his three seasons at Elon, West was the starting quarterback and the team won three conference championships. He was named Most Valuable Player (MVP) on the 1973 team that lost the Division I National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics title game to Abilene Christian; the Abilene Christian team was led by future professional football players Clint Longley and Wilbert Montgomery. West left Elon holding three passing records that were not broken for 20 years, and was inducted into the Elon Sports Hall of Fame in 1986, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>class</b> as former North Carolina State women's basketball coach Kay Yow.|$|E

5|$|During {{the design}} process, the A318 {{encountered}} several problems. The {{first one was}} the decline in demand for new aircraft following the September 11 attacks. Another was the new Pratt & Whitney turbofan engines, which burned more fuel than expected; by the time CFM International (CFM) had a more efficient engine ready for market, many A318 customers had already backed out, including Air China and British Airways. America West Airlines, which had selected the Pratt & Whitney engines, amended its A318 orders, opting instead for A319 or A320 aircraft. Trans World Airlines cancelled a significant order for fifty A318s after being acquired by American Airlines, which did not operate any A320 family aircraft at the time (although neither did TWA when the order was originally placed). While Airbus was hoping to market the A318 as a regional jet alternative, laws in both the U.S. and Europe have kept it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>class</b> as larger aircraft for calculating charges such as landing fees, limiting the type's market potential.|$|E

His parents separated after Audrey discovered Bill had had an affair that started while he was stationed in the army during World War II. He began attending Hounslow College and stayed there through his early teenage years. He was influenced by Elvis Presley by hearing his records at home and at the local youth club. He switched to go to Acton County Grammar School (now Acton High School) to take his O Levels, where he was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>class</b> as Pete Townshend, but became distracted from studies after leaving the local cinema having watched a Presley film, deciding {{that he wanted to be}} a rock'n'roll singer.
