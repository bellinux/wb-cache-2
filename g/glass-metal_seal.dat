40|$|The {{test results}} of 320 units of a laser {{initiated}} microdetonator are summarized. The commercially fabricated units used a lead styphnate/lead azide/HMX (1 mg/ 13. 5 mg) explosive train design {{contained in a}} miniature aluminum can that was capped with a <b>glass-metal</b> <b>seal</b> window. The test parameters were the laser energy, temperature, laser pulse duration, laser wavelength and nuclear radiation (5, 000, 000 rad of 1 MeV gamma rays). The performance parameters were the laser energy for ignition and the actuation response time...|$|E
40|$|The {{test results}} of 320 {{units of the}} laser {{initiated}} microdetonator are summarized. The commercially fabricated units used a lead styphnate/lead azide/HMX (1 mg/ 17. 5 mg/ 13. 5 mg) explosive train design contained in a miniature aluminum can and completed with a <b>glass-metal</b> <b>seal</b> window. The test parameters were {{the high and low}} laser energy, high and low temperature, laser pulse duration, laser wavelength and nuclear radiation (5 x 10 to the 6 th rads of 1 MeV gamma ray). The performance parameters were the laser energy for ignition and the actuation response time. Included also is a description of the development of a flexible, continuously advanced train of explosive devices by using the units, miniature optics and fiber optics...|$|E
50|$|Like platinum, gold {{does not}} form oxides that could assist in bonding. Glass-gold bonds are {{therefore}} metallic {{in color and}} weak. Gold tends {{to be used for}} <b>glass-metal</b> <b>seals</b> only rarely. Special compositions of soda-lime glasses that match the thermal expansion of gold, containing tungsten trioxide and oxides of lanthanum, aluminum and zirconium, exist.|$|R
50|$|Indium {{and some}} of its alloys {{can be used as a}} solder capable of wetting glass, ceramics, and metals and joining them together. Indium has low melting point and is very soft; the {{softness}} allows it to deform plastically and absorb the stresses from thermal expansion mismatches. Due to its very low vapor pressure, indium finds use in <b>glass-metal</b> <b>seals</b> used in vacuum technology.|$|R
50|$|During encapsulation, {{bonding wires}} can be severed, shorted, or touch the chip die, usually at the edge. Dies can crack due to {{mechanical}} overstress or thermal shock; defects introduced during processing, like scribing, can develop into fractures. Lead frames may contain excessive material or burrs, causing shorts. Ionic contaminants like alkali metals and halogens can migrate from the packaging materials to the semiconductor dies, causing corrosion or parameter deterioration. <b>Glass-metal</b> <b>seals</b> commonly fail by forming radial cracks that originate at the pin-glass interface and permeate outwards; other causes include a weak oxide layer {{on the interface}} and poor formation of a glass meniscus around the pin.|$|R
40|$|The Isothermal Dendritic Growth Experiment (IDGE) {{has been}} {{designed}} to provide microgravity data on dendritic growth for a critical test of theory. This paper updates progress on constructing a crystal growth chamber suitable for space flight. The IDGE chamber is constructed from glass and stainless steel and is hermetically sealed by electron beam welds and <b>glass-metal</b> <b>seals.</b> Initial tests of the chambers sample's melting point plateau show that the new chamber design is capable of preserving the 99. 9995 percent purity of succinonitrile. Dendrite growth can be initiated {{in the center of the}} IDGE chamber by means of thermo-electric coolers and a capillary injector tube (stinger). The new IDGE chamber is ready for fully integrated tests with the prototype IDGE engineering hardware at NASA's Lewis Research Center...|$|R
50|$|Kovar, an iron-nickel-cobalt alloy, has low thermal {{expansion}} similar to high-borosilicate glass and is frequently used for <b>glass-metal</b> <b>seals</b> especially for the application in x-ray tubes or glass lasers. It can bond to glass via the intermediate oxide layer of nickel(II) oxide and cobalt(II) oxide; the proportion of iron oxide is low due to its reduction with cobalt. The bond strength is highly dependent on the oxide layer thickness and character. The presence of cobalt makes the oxide layer easier to melt and dissolve in the molten glass. A grey, grey-blue or grey-brown color indicates a good seal. A metallic color indicates lack of oxide, while black color indicates overly oxidized metal, in both cases leading to a weak joint.|$|R
