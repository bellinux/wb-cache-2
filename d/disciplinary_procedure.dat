25|$|The primary {{implied term}} of an {{employment}} contract {{that may be}} broken is mutual trust and confidence. In Johnson v Unisys Ltd the House of Lords held by 4 to 1 that damages for breach of mutual trust and confidence {{at the point of}} dismissal should not exceed the statutory limit on unfair dismissal claims, because otherwise the statutory limits would be undermined. This limit was £74,200 in 2013, though the median award was merely £4,560. This meant a computer worker who developed a psychiatric illness following a wrongful dismissal procedure could not claim his total economic losses, which would have amounted to £400,000 in damages. However, if the breach occurs while the employment relationship subsists, that limit is inapplicable. So in Eastwood v Magnox Electric plc, a school teacher who also suffered psychiatric injury, but as a result of harassment and victimisation while he still worked, could claim for a full measure of damages for the breach of mutual trust and confidence. In any event the limit is merely implied and depends on construction of the contract, so that it may be opted out of by express words providing for a higher sum, for example, by expressly providing for a <b>disciplinary</b> <b>procedure.</b> A notable absence of an implied term at common law historically (i.e. before the development of mutual trust and confidence) was that an employer would have to give any good reasons for a dismissal. This was recommended to be changed in the Donovan Report 1968, and it launched the present system of unfair dismissal.|$|E

2500|$|The {{process that}} ended with Sousa Mendes’ {{discharge}} from his consular career began with two visas: [...] the first issued on November 28, 1939 to Professor Arnold Wiznitzer, an Austrian historian who had been stripped of his nationality by the Nuremberg Laws, and the second on March 1, 1940 to the Spanish Republican Eduardo Neira Laporte, an anti-Franco activist living in France. Sousa Mendes was reprimanded and warned in writing that [...] "any new transgression or violation on this issue will be considered disobedience and will entail a <b>disciplinary</b> <b>procedure</b> where {{it will not be}} possible to overlook that you have repeatedly committed acts which have entailed warnings and reprimands." ...|$|E
2500|$|Schmidt's remarks {{threw the}} House into an uproar and earned her the sobriquet [...] "Mean Jean". Many Democrats {{saw it as}} an unwarranted attack against Murtha, a 38-year Marine Corps veteran. After she said [...] "cowards cut and run, Marines never do," [...] angry Democrats nearly drowned out her words. Victor F. Snyder, a former Marine, of Arkansas demanded that Schmidt's remarks be [...] "taken down." [...] Under this <b>disciplinary</b> <b>procedure,</b> the House clerk would have re-read Schmidt's words and the {{presiding}} officer (at the time, Michael K. Simpson of Idaho) would have ruled whether they were parliamentary. [...] Had they been ruled unparliamentary, Schmidt {{would not have been}} able to speak for the rest of the day without permission.|$|E
2500|$|The {{requirements}} of notice and any <b>disciplinary</b> <b>procedure</b> {{do not apply}} if the employee {{was the one to}} have repudiated the contract, either expressly, or by conduct. As in the general law of contract, if an employee's conduct is so seriously bad that it manifests to the reasonable person an intention to not be bound, then the employer may dismiss the employee without notice. But if the employer is not justified in making a summary dismissal, the employee has a claim under ERA 1996 section 13 for a shortfall in wages. The same principle, that a serious breach of contract gives the other side the option to terminate, also works in favour of employees. In Wilson v Racher a gardener was bullied by his employer, the heir of Tolethorpe Hall, and gave him a rude telling off for not picking up some string on the lawn. Mr Wilson, the gardener, told Mr Racher [...] "get stuffed, go and shit yourself". The Court of Appeal held that the employer's attitude meant this breakdown in trust and confidence was the employer's own doing, and because the law no longer saw employment as a [...] "Czar-serf" [...] relationship, Mr Wilson was in the right and was wrongfully dismissed. The remedy for breach of contract, following a long tradition that specific performance should not result in draconian consequences or binding hostile parties to continue working together, is typically monetary compensation to put the claimant in the same position as if the contract had been properly performed. However, in Edwards v Chesterfield Royal Hospital, the Supreme Court held that an injunction is available to restrain breach of contract for the employer's failure to follow a doctor's contractual <b>disciplinary</b> <b>procedure.</b> This indicated that specific performance should always in principle be available, particularly in large organisations where people can be shifted to avoid personality conflicts.|$|E

2500|$|Wrongful {{dismissal}} {{refers to}} a termination of employment which contravenes a contract's terms, whether expressly agreed or implied by the courts. This depends on construction of the contract, read {{in the context of}} the statutory charter of rights for employees in the ERA 1996. In the old common law cases, the only term implied by the courts regarding termination was that employers had to give reasonable notice, and what was [...] "reasonable" [...] essentially depended on the professional status of the employee. In Creen v Wright, Lord Coleridge CJ held that a master mariner was entitled to a month's notice, though lower class workers could probably expect much less, [...] "respectable" [...] employees could expect more, and the period between wage payments would be a guide. Now the ERA 1996 section 86 prescribes that an employee should receive one week's notice before dismissal after one month's work, two weeks' notice after two years' work, and so forth up to twelve weeks for twelve years. The employer can give pay in lieu of notice, so long as the weeks' wages for the notice are paid in full. Often, contracts of employment contain express terms regarding a proper <b>disciplinary</b> <b>procedure</b> to be followed if someone is to be dismissed for disputes at work. Dismissals will usually be regarded as both wrongful and unfair if a procedure for dismissal is not followed. If a contractual <b>disciplinary</b> <b>procedure</b> is not followed, the employee may claim damages for the time it would have taken and the potential that she would still be employed. In Societe Generale, London Branch v Geys, the Supreme Court affirmed that a wrongful repudiation of a contract by the employer would not automatically terminate the agreement, because to do so would be to reward the wrongdoer. Only if an employee accepts the purported termination will the contract end. Until then the employer is liable for paying wages, and other terms of the contract, such as dismissal procedures, will survive.|$|E

40|$|This paper critiques {{the public}} {{interest}} proclamations of accounting professions with particular reference {{to the role of}} <b>disciplinary</b> <b>procedures</b> in protecting these interests. It is argued that professions' widely declared concerns for {{the public interest}}, often conceptualized as encompassing a commitment to public accountability and transparency, are frequently used as a convenient mechanism for avoiding criticism and maintaining the power and privilege of delegated self-regulation. This argument is developed by examining the role played by <b>disciplinary</b> <b>procedures,</b> in particular the reporting of their results, in creating a perception that the profession acts in the public interest. The critique is supported with data derived from an investigation of the <b>disciplinary</b> <b>procedures</b> of one accounting body, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland (ICAI). The results of this examination indicate that the ICAI process appears deficient in terms of its accountability and transparency and further that there is little fairness or equity in terms of the penalties applied to members for offences committed. This tends to support prior research which suggests that <b>disciplinary</b> <b>procedures</b> (and the ethical codes they purportedly enforce) fulfil a 'profession protection' as opposed to a 'society protection' role aimed at insulating the profession from inspection and assessment from outside parties. Implications for the accounting profession and for future research are discussed. ...|$|R
