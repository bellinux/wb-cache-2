5|$|A 1942 piece, The Old Checkered House, 1862 was {{appraised}} at the Memphis 2004 Antiques Roadshow. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> {{common as}} her winter landscapes. Originally purchased in the 1940s for under $10, {{the piece was}} assigned an insurance value of $60,000 by the appraiser, Alan Fausel.|$|E
5|$|Although {{this process}} {{successfully}} integrated {{the vast majority}} of princely states into India, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> successful for a few, notably the former princely states of Jammu and Kashmir, Tripura and Manipur, where active secessionist movements exist.|$|E

5|$|A Baptist {{church was}} {{organized}} at Monte Ne under {{the sponsorship of}} the Benton County Baptist Association {{as a result of}} a series of revival meetings conducted there. The Monte Ne Baptist Church is still active. For a time in the summer of 1946, the Rogers Intermediate Girl Scouts held a camp at the Hotel Frances (old Hotel Monte Ne). Although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> active as it once was, the old filling station and store in downtown Monte Ne continued to serve the local population.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as these}} molecules, {{emission}} from heavy atoms such as iron, magnesium and silicon was detected, with abundances {{consistent with what}} would {{be found in a}} cometary nucleus. Although a substantial amount of water was detected spectroscopically, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> much as predicted beforehand, meaning that either the water layer thought to exist below the clouds was thinner than predicted, or that the cometary fragments did not penetrate deeply enough.|$|E
5|$|Despite The Big Room being {{critically}} acclaimed, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> commercially {{successful as}} their first album, which Verdens Gang {{attributed to a}} lacklustre promotion campaign by Atlantic Records. Half way through their tour with Jewel in mid July, M2M were removed as the opening act by Atlantic who cited disappointing sales of The Big Room, which at that time had sold around 100,000 units in America. Shocked and disappointed by the decision, M2M returned to Norway, and ceased performing together. Raven was immediately offered a solo record contract from Atlantic, though she later withdrew from the offer.|$|E

5|$|Early {{reports on}} the {{centrifugal}} method indicated that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> efficient as predicted. Urey suggested that a more efficient but technically more complicated countercurrent system be used instead of the previous flow-through method. By November 1941, technical obstacles seemed formidable enough for the process to be abandoned. Countercurrent centrifuges were developed after the war, and today are the favored method in many countries.|$|E
5|$|Flooding {{returned}} {{in the winter}} of early 1890, when the river first rose very quickly and then fell very quickly. Portland's main street was completely submerged, communication over the Cascades was cut off, and many rail lines were forced to shut down. In 1894, another major flood occurred on the Willamette, and although it too caused huge damage, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> large as that of 1861.|$|E
5|$|However, on 15 March 2016, American comedian Jim Breuer (a {{friend of}} Johnson) {{revealed}} on his podcast that Johnson {{had received a}} second opinion on his hearing and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> bad as initially thought. Nonetheless, Breuer mentioned that Johnson {{told him that he}} was essentially fired from AC/DC and that he hadn't heard from the band since the announcement of the tour being postponed, adding that Angus Young wants to continue the band for at least another ten years and do at least one more studio album and world tour. Breuer later clarified his comments on Facebook that did not end speculation on Johnson's future with the band.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, the National Centre for Popular Music, {{a museum}} {{dedicated}} {{to the subject of}} popular music, was opened in the city. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> successful as was hoped, however, and later evolved to become a live music venue; then in February 2005, the unusual steel-covered building became the students' union for Sheffield Hallam University. Live music venues in the city include the Harley Hotel, Leadmill, West Street Live, the Boardwalk, Dove & Rainbow, The Casbah, The Cremorne, Corporation, New Barrack Tavern, The Broadfield Hotel, Redstone bar and nightclub, the City Hall, the University of Sheffield Students' Union, the Studio Theatre at the Crucible Theatre, the O2 Academy Sheffield and The Grapes.|$|E
5|$|On 31 July 1879, {{the last}} day of their {{agreement}} with Carte, the directors of the Comedy Opera Company attempted to repossess the Pinafore set by force during a performance, causing a celebrated fracas. Carte's stagehands managed to ward off their backstage attackers and protect the scenery and props. The Comedy Opera Company opened a rival production of H.M.S. Pinafore in London, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> popular as the D'Oyly Carte production and soon closed. Legal action over the ownership of the rights ended in victory for Carte, Gilbert and Sullivan. From 1 August 1879, the new company, later called the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, became the sole authorised producer of the works of Gilbert and Sullivan.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} in Hong Kong in 1992 to generally positive audience reception, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> commercially successful as Woo's previous action films, such as A Better Tomorrow and The Killer. Reception from western critics was much more positive; many critics and film scholars have come to proclaim its action scenes as among the best ever filmed. In 2007, a video game sequel titled Stranglehold was released, {{which is in the}} process of being made into a film.|$|E

5|$|The {{first draft}} {{and part of}} the editing process was {{completed}} before Fleming's death and the manuscript had passed through the hands of his copy editor, William Plomer, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> polished as other Bond stories. Much of the detail contained in the previous novels was missing, as this was often added by Fleming in the second draft. Publishers Jonathan Cape passed the manuscript to Kingsley Amis for his thoughts and advice on the story, although his suggestions were not subsequently used.|$|E
5|$|When in January 1793 a Prussian corps entered Greater Poland, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> a Commonwealth ally, {{but instead}} to {{guarantee}} Prussia's share of spoils in the Second Partition of Poland. Prussian forces were acting {{in support of}} the Prussian-Russian treaty on the partition has been that month. Subsequently, Prussian forces assisted Russians in several key battles of the Kościuszko Uprising, such as in the defeat of Tadeusz Kościuszko's forces at the battle of Szczekociny. By 1795, Commonwealth would cease to exist, with Prussia acquiring Gdańsk, Toruń and other territories it desired (see Prussian partition).|$|E
5|$|Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) is {{a measure}} of how active a {{hurricane}} season is. It is calculated by squaring the windspeed of a cyclone with at least tropical storm-force winds every six hours, summing the results, and dividing that total by 104. This explains why Hurricane Guillermo has a higher ACE than Linda. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> strong as that storm, but because it was above tropical storm force for a longer time, it reached a higher ACE level. As a tropical cyclone does not have gale-force winds until it becomes a tropical storm, tropical depressions are not included in these tables. For all storms, ACE is given to three significant figures. The ACE in the east Pacific proper (140°W to North America) is given; the ACE in the central Pacific (the international dateline to 140°W) is given in brackets.|$|E

5|$|An {{average of}} 23.2 million viewers in the United Kingdom watched the event, with an {{estimated}} 750 million worldwide. Critics were generally positive, but noted that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> good as the opening ceremony. Some of the foreign reviews questioned whether everyone would have understood the nods to British film and television. George Michael was roundly criticised for his song choice while Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell and Russell Brand were criticised for not demonstrating the Olympic ethos in their past behaviour. Some performers were initially reluctant to appear, and other high-profile acts turned down invitations to perform at the ceremony. NBC in the United States and Prime TV in New Zealand were criticised by viewers for their broadcasts of the ceremony. There was also a concert in Hyde Park to close the Olympics, featuring Blur, New Order, and The Specials.|$|E
5|$|Commercially, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> {{successful}} as her previous records in Japan. It debuted at number five on the Oricon Albums Chart and sold 39,295 units, making it Hamasaki's lowest first week sales {{in her career}} {{at the time and}} was her first album to miss the top three position. Its low first week sales were attributed to the lack of promotion of the album and stiff competition by other artists at the time, as described by Japanese publications. It dropped to number 16 the following week, her first album not to stay inside the top ten for at least two weeks, with sales of 6,122 units. The following week, it slipped to number 31 with 2,922 units sold, and fell outside the top 50 the following week. It sold 53,406 units by the end of 2014, and was ranked number 98 on Oricon's Annual Chart. Despite its much lower success, it became her 47th record to chart within the top ten on the Oricon Albums Chart; Hamasaki became the second artist in Japanese music history to achieve this after Yumi Matsutoya. Elsewhere, the album reached number 75 and 16 on the South Korean Gaon Albums Chart and Gaon International Chart.|$|E
5|$|During their 15-day {{rest periods}} the company's men congregated around the Belgian-owned Elizabeth Hotel, in {{the centre of}} the city at the corner of Causeway and Manica Road. Many of them became seriously disaffected when they first {{received}} their salary from the Rhodesian Army. Having apparently been misled about wages of up to R$1,000 per month (₣7,000) by the French recruiters, they were surprised to find that their basic monthly pay was actually R$245 (₣1,800), the same as a regular Rhodesian soldier. Moreover, some were upset that they had been paid in Rhodesian dollars, which because of the country's international isolation could not easily be exchanged for foreign currencies. Although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> much as they had been expecting, one disenchanted veteran of the unit afterwards admitted that the tax-exempt R$245 wage, which came with a $10 special-unit supplement, was still more than enough money for them to live comfortably in Salisbury during their time off.|$|E
