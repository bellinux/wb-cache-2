It has however resurfaced in recent debates over the jury trial right in patent cases. In the 1995 case of In re Lockwood, the Federal Circuit used it to distinguish <b>invalidity</b> <b>proceedings</b> from inequitable conduct proceedings, arguing that the proceedings under section 10 of the Patent Act of 1793 were more similar to proceedings of the inequitable conduct kind, and therefore the jury-trial right did not extend to modern <b>invalidity</b> <b>proceedings.</b>|$|E
