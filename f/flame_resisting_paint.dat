40|$|A nitrogen-diluted {{hydrogen}} flame {{is modeled}} numerically {{in a plane}} two-dimensional counterflow configuration using a constant density, one-step reaction model and an optically thin radiation model. The 1 D steady-state flame response shows duel extinction limits, namely the low Damkhöler number (high stretch rate) blow-off extinction limit and the high Damkhöler number (low stretch rate) radiative extinction limit. For high-stretch radiative flames there exist cellular flame structures close to and beyond the 1 D blow-off extinction limit, thereby indicating the ability of <b>flame</b> to <b>resist</b> quenching by stretch. High-stretch flame {{results indicate that the}} 2 D bifurcation from the one-dimensional flame response curve, previously reported for the adiabatic flames, exists for flames with radiative heat loss as well. Close to the 1 D radiative extinction limit the 1 D low-stretch radiative flame exhibits oscillatory response, indicating that oscillatory instability in diffusion flames can be triggered by radiative heat loss. The flame oscillation eventually leads to flame extinction at a stretch rate higher than the corresponding steady-state 1 D radiative extinction limit, thereby demonstrating the ability of the low-stretch <b>flames</b> to <b>resist</b> quenching by radiative loss. Towards the low-stretch radiative extinction limit a similar bifurcation of the two-dimensional flame branch from the one-dimensional flame response curve is obtained. The dependences of the structure and transition of the two-dimensional cellular flames on the initial profile were studied on the bifurcated 2 D branches obtained near the high-stretch and the low-stretch extinction limits. The results suggest that the 2 D bifurcations can exist even without the flame having an edge, though the transition of the flame on the bifurcated 2 D branches is different when an initial flame edge is present...|$|R

Often, hair would be encased within a glass or woven with metallic threads, {{paired with a}} metal setting to be worn as mourning jewelry, a memento of a friend or loved one. Hairwork, an art still practiced today by the Victorian Hairwork Society, was a popular needlework method, often resulting in 2-dimensional mourning wreaths and graveyard scenes, worked in hair on a fabric ground.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{flammability}} limits {{in the presence}} of flame interaction, and the existence of negative flame speeds are discussed. Downstream interaction between two counterflow premixed flames of different stoichiometries are experimentally studied. Various flame configurations are observed and quantified; these include the binary system of two lean or rich flames, the triplet system of a lean and a rich flame separated by a diffusion flame, and single diffusion flames with some degree of premixedness. Extinction limits are determined for methane/air and butane/air mixtures over the entire range of mixture concentrations. The results show that the extent of flame interaction depends on the separation distance between the flames which are functions of the mixtures' concentrations, the stretch rate, and the effective Lewis numbers (Le). In particular, in a positively-stretched flow field Le 1 (1) mixtures tend to interact strongly (weakly), while the converse holds for flames in a negatively-stretched flow. Also established was the existence of negative flames whose propagation velocity is in the same general direction as that of the bulk convective flow, being supported by diffusion alone. Their existence demonstrates the tendency of <b>flames</b> to <b>resist</b> extinction, and further emphasizes the possibility of very lean or rich mixtures to undergo combustion...|$|R
40|$|Paintings {{and insects}} {{might seem like}} odd companions. In this paper I {{describe}} how a series of paintings I made depicting insects creates associations between mimesis and mimicry in order to flag a sort of protective self-referentiality – one where <b>painting</b> <b>resists</b> its proverbial ‘end’ and insects are presented as vital new orders. Drawing upon art historical references, such as Surrealism and the modernist grid, I argue that playing on these references and the compositional effects of camouflage enlivens our regard for the sensuous worlds of both insects and painting. I conclude by exploring how paintings of insects are powerful metaphors for imagining new non-hierarchal relationships between humans and non-humans...|$|R
40|$|Floppiness {{proceeds}} {{from one of}} the most valuable properties of paint -­&# 8208; its solubility. The liquid condition of <b>paint</b> <b>resists</b> describing stabilised forms and allows for unexpected permutations, acknowledgement of which opens up new possibilities for authorship. It can soften, dissolve, or extend the boundaries of a form so that its precise shape and location in space becomes ambiguous. The resulting category of image I have termed Floppy Realism, to describe a representative act where forms or objects become slippery and difficult to grasp. Such a position is central to my practice. This essay maps the topography of Floppy Realism, taking the work of Giorgio Morandi and Mark Rothko as fluid points parenthesising this malleability. I establish a common condition borne by artists who do not describe form and space as singular and exclusive, but bound together as matter in mutual exchange. This essay and my accompanying studio practice will document these exchanges...|$|R
50|$|Merritt painted her best-known work, Love Locked Out, {{in memory}} of her late husband, who died in 1877 just three months after their wedding. She had hoped to have the image done in bronze as a monument, but could not afford it. Merritt {{initially}} <b>resisted</b> allowing the <b>painting</b> to be copied despite innumerable” requests, because she feared the subject would be misinterpreted: “I feared people liked it {{as a symbol of}} forbidden love,” she wrote in her memoir, “while my Love was waiting for the door of death to open and the reunion of the lonely pair”. Though Merritt was already a recognized working artist, she had intended to end her professional career after her wedding, but she returned to painting after his death. Ironically, though she was American, Love Locked Out was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1890 and became the first painting by a woman artist acquired for the British national collection through the Chantrey Bequest.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{addition}} of exhaust gas to a combustor may cause liftoff of a diffusion flame due to several possible mechanisms. Understanding the relative influence of these mechanisms is {{of importance for}} the further development of exhaust gas recirculation combustion technology. The authors present a numerical study {{on the effects of}} CO 2, N 2 (two of primary exhaust gas components) and Ar addition on the liftoff of a laminar CH 4 /air diffusion flame. A gradual switch-off approach was used to identify the relative importance of the different mechanisms. A detailed reaction scheme and complex thermal and transport properties were employed. The simulation results were validated by comparing the calculated and previously measured critical ratios of the 3 additives for liftoff. The results show that the numerical simulation successfully reproduced the previously measured critical ratios of liftoff for all 3 studied additives. Detailed analysis of the numerical results suggests that the {{addition of}} N 2 affects flame liftoff due to the sole effect of dilution. On the other hand, the addition of CO 2 causes flame liftoff due to the dilution, thermal and chemical effects, with the dilution effect being the most significant one, followed by the thermal and chemical effects. All 3 effects tend to reduce combustion intensity and cause flame liftoff, leading to the smaller critical ratio of CO 2 than that of N 2. The radiation and transport property effects are negligible for CO 2 addition. Ar addition affects flame liftoff due to dilution, thermal, and transport property effects. However, whereas the dilution effect tends to reduce combustion intensity and cause flame liftoff, the thermal and transport property effects tend to increase combustion intensity and <b>resist</b> <b>flame</b> liftoff for Ar addition, which results in the greater critical ratio of Ar than that of N 2. Therefore, for the 3 studied additives in this paper, CO 2 has the minimum critical ratio, whereas Ar has the maximum for liftoff...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} and numerical study of turbulent fire suppression is presented. For this work, a novel and canonical facility has been developed, featuring a buoyant, turbulent, methane or propane-fueled diffusion flame suppressed via either nitrogen dilution of the oxidizer or {{application of a}} fine water mist. Flames are stabilized on a slot burner surrounded by a co-flowing oxidizer, which allows controlled delivery of either suppressant to achieve a range of conditions from complete combustion through partial and total flame quenching. A minimal supply of pure oxygen is optionally applied along the burner to provide a strengthened <b>flame</b> base that <b>resists</b> liftoff extinction and permits the study of substantially weakened turbulent flames. The carefully designed facility features well-characterized inlet and boundary conditions that are especially amenable to numerical simulation. Non-intrusive diagnostics provide detailed measurements of suppression behavior, yielding insight into the governing suppression processes, and aiding the development and validation of advanced suppression models. Diagnostics include oxidizer composition analysis to determine suppression potential, flame imaging to quantify visible flame structure, luminous and radiative emissions measurements to assess sooting propensity and heat losses, and species-based calorimetry to evaluate global heat release and combustion efficiency. The studied flames experience notable suppression effects, including transition in color from bright yellow to dim blue, expansion in flame height and structural intermittency, and reduction in radiative heat emissions. Still, measurements indicate that the combustion efficiency remains close to unity, and only near the extinction limit do the flames experience an abrupt transition from nearly complete combustion to total extinguishment. Measurements are compared with large eddy simulation results obtained using the Fire Dynamics Simulator, an open-source computational fluid dynamics software package. Comparisons of {{experimental and}} simulated results are {{used to evaluate the}} performance of available models in predicting fire suppression. Simulations in the present configuration highlight the issue of spurious reignition that is permitted by the classical eddy-dissipation concept for modeling turbulent combustion. To address this issue, simple treatments to prevent spurious reignition are developed and implemented. Simulations incorporating these treatments are shown to produce excellent agreement with the experimentally measured data, including the global combustion efficiency...|$|R
40|$|The {{historical}} {{trade in}} Indian textiles to Thailand can be well documented {{from the beginning}} of the seventeenth century. Archaeological as well as textual sources allow our understanding of this trade to the region to be pushed back to the late thirteenth century, when Indian textiles had already assumed a high status at the court of Angkor. In the course of the Ayudhyan period the control of this trade appears to have been secured by the Thai king and nobility. The earliest European accounts of trade with Thailand refer to the central role the king assumed, as both the dispenser of trading privileges (such as monopolies in specific commodities extended to the Dutch East Indies Company, the VOQ, and, through his agents, as the major benefactor from domestic trade. Members of the royal household and nobility appear to have been the recipients of high quality Indian <b>painted</b> <b>resist</b> and mordant-dyed cotton cloths (saudagiri), which served as lower garments (pha nung) and as curtaining. As early as 1514 Tome Pires observed that certain designs were produced on the Coromandel Coast 2 ̆ 2 in the fashion of Siam 2 ̆ 2 and could not be successfully sold elsewhere. Such cloths also formed part of diplomatic exchanges, as when twenty-nine rolls of Indian cloth were presented to a member of a Persian embassy to the court of King Phra Narai in 1685. Indian Thai market textiles were clearly much prized, being worthy gifts to loyal members of the nobility and visiting ambassadors. The imported textile trade in Thailand was closely controlled by the king and his factors, and the specificity of designs underscores that these cloths were produced expressly for this market. However, commercial control of goods entering the country does not imply that these cloths were produced to 2 ̆ 7 royal command. 2 ̆ 2 The role of the Thai court in determining designs, and the sources for the samples or pattern books undoubtedly sent to the Indian manufacturers, were also explored in this paper...|$|R
