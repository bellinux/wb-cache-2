One of the main objectives of the single market programme (1985) was the opening of national markets {{in order to create a}} <b>European</b> <b>financial</b> <b>area</b> with the free provision of financial services. Its implementation started in 1993 with the application of the second banking directive. 1 In this context, monetary union is often seen as the accomplishment of the process of European financial integration.

50|$|Run by Eurofidai, the BEDOFIH project aims {{to create}} a {{high-frequency}} <b>European</b> <b>financial</b> database, allowing for the precise analysis of the increasingly dynamic workings of <b>European</b> <b>financial</b> markets. Current research on <b>European</b> <b>financial</b> markets is held back {{by a lack of}} available data. The BEDOFIH project will allow researchers to exploit high-frequency European data histories and thus work towards constructing more reliable financial models and new forms of financial regulation. In light of the implications of this research, the Financial Markets Authority (Autorité des Marchés Financiers) and the Directorate General of the Treasury (Direction Générale du Trésor) in France have supported the project.|$|R
