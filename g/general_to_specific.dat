The industrial revolution changed advertising from informative flyers marking the availability of goods in 17th and 18th century Europe, whose audience were those within physical propinquity, to multimillion-dollar campaigns that attempted to instantly connect and persuade peoples from across the world.

During this period, not only did the immensity of the advertising industry drastically change, but so did its marketing strategies as it began to incorporate images and specify an audience.

5000|$|He {{wrote a book}} on {{language}} structure and the logic of descriptions, Inferential Semantics, published in 1978. [...] The work analyzes sentences and longer passages into mathematical lattices (the kind in Lattice Theory, not crystal lattices) which are in fact semantic networks, each node {{of which is a}} concept in one or more structured conceptual dimensions (which are also lattice structures); this places a description in a resulting abstract lattice of possible descriptions, ordered from <b>general</b> <b>to</b> <b>specific.</b> This structure can be used in artificial intelligence and machine translation. He factors some of the dimensions (like a quantifier lattice, a case lattice, et al.) into sub-lattices (to divide-and-conquer into semantic [...] "factors" [...] or [...] "dimensions").|$|E
50|$|Animism is {{the belief}} that inanimate objects are capable of actions and have lifelike qualities. An example could be a child believing that the {{sidewalk}} was mad and made them fall down, or that the stars twinkle in the sky because they are happy. Artificialism refers to the belief that environmental characteristics can be attributed to human actions or interventions. For example, a child might say that it is windy outside because someone is blowing very hard, or the clouds are white because someone painted them that color. Finally, precausal thinking is categorized by transductive reasoning. Transductive reasoning is when a child fails to understand the true relationships between cause and effect. Unlike deductive or inductive reasoning (<b>general</b> <b>to</b> <b>specific,</b> or specific to general), transductive reasoning refers to when a child reasons from specific to specific, drawing a relationship between two separate events that are otherwise unrelated. For example, if a child hears the dog bark and then a balloon popped, the child would conclude that because the dog barked, the balloon popped.|$|E
