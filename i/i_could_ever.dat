5|$|From {{the very}} beginning, {{from the first}} moment I may almost say, of my {{acquaintance}} with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form that the groundwork of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike. And I had not known you a month before I felt {{that you were the}} last man in the world whom <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> be prevailed on to marry.|$|E
500|$|In the Spring of 2017, Green Ronin Publishing {{announced}} The World of Lazarus, {{a campaign}} setting in their Modern AGE role-playing game. Although initially planned for a November 2017 release, {{it was later}} delayed until January 2018 to allow more time for development. Rucka said role playing games had {{an important part of}} his development as a writer, and that having one of his ideas turned into one [...] "might just possibly be the greatest compliment <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> receive." ...|$|E
500|$|PedroII {{regarded}} {{the death of}} his son as [...] "the most fatal blow that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> receive, and certainly I would not have survived were it not that I still have a wife and two children". The Emperor wrote to his brother-in-law Dom FernandoII, King-consort of Portugal: [...] "By the time you receive this, you will certainly have learnt of the grievous loss I have undergone... God who has made me pass though so hard a testing, will in his mercy give me grounds to console my sorrows." [...] PedroII had already lost another son, Dom Afonso, almost three years earlier. He revealed his inner turmoil in a sonnet: [...] "Twice already I have suffered death, for the father dies who sees his son is dead." [...] Except for brief inspection visits, the Emperor avoided Santa Cruz thereafter.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{directed}} their commentaries of {{the music}} video towards Ferreira's increasingly risqué public persona, shifting from the more innocent image with which she launched her career. A writer from MuuMuse provided a favorable review, comparing it to the visuals for [...] "Criminal" [...] by Fiona Apple and summarizing that [...] "Sky Ferreira is cooler than anything you and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> be." [...] Becky Bain from Idolator stated that the appearance of Toby the Tarantula was [...] "somehow nowhere near as disconcerting as the image of Sky, looking washed out with platinum hair against a white background, crazily painting her face with a tube of red lipstick." [...] Michael Cragg of The Guardian felt that Ferreira's friendship with the controversial Richardson showcased a [...] "shift away from the pop princess {{she felt she was}} being moulded into", and commented that the spider was [...] "not for the faint-hearted".|$|E
500|$|Iron Man and Iron Man 2 {{director}} Jon Favreau said in December 2010 that {{he would}} not direct Iron Man 3, opting to direct Magic Kingdom instead. He remained an executive producer of director Joss Whedon's crossover film The Avengers and also served as an executive producer of Iron Man 3. Also in 2010, Downey reached out to Shane Black, who directed him in 2005's Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, to write and direct the film. In February 2011, Black entered final negotiations to join the project, and in March it was announced that Drew Pearce, who Marvel had originally hired for a Runaways script, would work with Black on the script. Downey said, [...] "Bringing in Shane Black to write and direct Iron Man 3 to me is basically the only transition from Favreau to a 'next thing' that Favreau and the audience and Marvel and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> actually sign off on." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I Will Be" [...] is a {{piano and}} guitar led song, which lasts for a {{duration}} of 3 minutes, 58 seconds. The song was composed {{in the key}} of G major using common time and a slow groove at 72beats per minute. Lewis's vocal range spans two octaves, from the low note of B3 to the high note of B5, on the song. The song opens with the lyrics [...] "There's nothing I could say to you, nothing <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> do to make you {{see what you mean}} to me." [...] Chad Grischow for IGN described the song's piano led instrumental to be [...] "overblown", but noted that Lewis has enough [...] "vocal strength to prevent her from being overshadowed by the drowningly lush sound." [...] Eric R. Danton wrote on his review of Spirit for the Hartford Courant daily that [...] "I Will Be" [...] begins with a [...] "spare piano introduction" [...] that [...] "blossoms into an arrangement buoyed by strings and then drums and guitar". Danton described Lewis's vocals as [...] "delicate" [...] and that [...] "take flight on the chorus".|$|E

500|$|In 1962 he {{appeared}} in Wendy Toye's comedy film We Joined the Navy before teaming up again with Peter Sellers in Only Two Can Play, Sidney Gilliat's film of the novel That Uncertain Feeling by Kingsley Amis; Powell noted with pleasure [...] "the armour of his gravity pierced by polite bewilderment". She compared Le Mesurier with the well-known American straight-face comedian, John McGiver. After appearing in another Sellers film in 1962—Waltz of the Toreadors—Le Mesurier joined him in the 1963 comedy The Wrong Arm of the Law. Powell again reviewed the pair's film, commenting that [...] "I thought I knew by now every shade in the acting of John Le Mesurier (not that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> get tired of any of them); but there seems a new shade here". In the same year {{he appeared}} in a third Sellers film, The Pink Panther, as a defence lawyer, {{and in the second}} Tony Hancock vehicle, The Punch and Judy Man. Le Mesurier played Sandman in the latter film; Powell wrote that the role [...] "allowed a gentler and subtler character than usual". He also appeared in a series of advertisements for Homepride flour in 1964, providing the voice-over for the animated character Fred the Flourgrader; he continued as the voice until 1983.|$|E
500|$|Debbage comments, [...] "One {{strength}} of Bradley Joseph {{as an artist}} has been his keen ability to write inspiring music with appropriately titled songs that express that thought non-verbally". [...] Joseph explained to Janus that, [...] "Through instrumental music, I'm allowed {{to come up with}} musical ideas that allow the listener to create their own impression of my song. If you add lyrics about a girl in the song, the listener doesn't have a choice of what the song is about, it's told to them. My musical writings allow me to express anything. [...] It's easier for me to tell a story of something I've encountered this way than to verbalize it. [...] And my feelings are explored more in my compositions compared to what <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> say in a few sentences." [...] He believes that [...] "music allows a person to express their deepest thoughts, thoughts that cannot be expressed with just words." [...] He also believes that the spiritual aspect of creating is to [...] "find something deep within yourself that can only be created by you"..."Your spiritual self cannot be copied and that's why it's so significant in life and music", he says. [...] Parsons goes on to say, [...] "The influence of years of touring with Yanni is apparent in the richness of Joseph's sound, but his musical voice is his own." [...] Yanni once said, [...] "Bradley, your extreme sensitivity is your greatest gift". Joseph later realized what Yanni meant was that he needed that as a composer, that it was a crucial component [...] "to be sensitive to what you see {{and to be able to}} apply that to music".|$|E
2500|$|The New Zealand Herald {{compared}} {{his retirement}} {{to those of}} Michael Jordan and Björn Borg on 15 February 2006. Cairns also {{left the door open}} for a comeback, but said [...] "I don't think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> be tempted back".|$|E
60|$|It {{never entered}} {{my mind that}} anyone <b>I</b> knew <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> by any chance meet an author, or even hear one lecture--although {{it was said that}} they did {{sometimes}} come west on altruistic educational journeys and that they sometimes reached our county town.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was very}} {{glad to see you}} as bad as myself, sir," [...] said Mrs. Frederick Langford. [...] "I was very much ashamed of being so foolish, but then, you know, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hardly <b>ever</b> read through that scene without crying." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dolly, Dolly," [...] the agonized mother cried, flinging herself {{upon her}} child's mercy, as it were; [...] "Don't {{be hard on}} me; don't be hard on me!

2500|$|In September of that year, {{the band}} {{announced}} their split. [...] "I have loved {{my time with}} Kula Shaker and have experienced more than <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> have imagined", Mills commented.

Soon after he {{accepted}} a diplomatic posting to Ethiopia, where he served as Poland's consul general until September 1939, when Germany invaded Poland. Skarbek later said of Giżycki: [...] "He was my Svengali {{for so many years}} that he would never believe that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> leave him for good." ...|$|E
2500|$|In My Game Your Game Campese remembered that, [...] "...that loss in New Zealand {{also had}} a {{positive}} effect. We {{made a lot of}} mistakes and the All Blacks managed only a narrow win. I knew that day that we'd beat New Zealand whenever we came across them at the World Cup. It was the first time <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> recall looking ahead and thinking we'd beat those guys." ...|$|E
5000|$|DeForge {{works as}} a {{designer}} for Cartoon Network's Adventure Time.

On {{the subject of}} his time with the England team, Sidebottom said [...] "If I look back on my international career I have achieved more than <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> have dreamed. I have had a truly fantastic period of my life with England. Winning the Twenty20 World Cup in the West Indies, my Test debut at Lords, a Test hat-trick against New Zealand, plus a Man of the Series award, {{are just a few of}} the highlights." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band did not tour {{in support}} of the album. Hollis explained, [...] "There is no way that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> play again {{a lot of the stuff}} I played on this album because I just wouldn't know how to. So, to play it live, to take a part that was done in spontaneity, to write it down and then get someone to play it, would lose the whole point, lose the whole purity of what it was in the first place." [...] The band would never tour again.|$|E
2500|$|On {{announcing his}} {{retirement}} from swimming on 10 February 2015, Cowdrey stated: [...] "I have been {{fortunate to have}} achieved more than <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> have dreamed of, and more than I set out to achieve, and more importantly I have enjoyed every minute of my time on the Australian swim team." [...] Glenn Tasker, President of the Australian Paralympic Committee said that: [...] "It has been an absolute privilege to watch Matthew develop from the quiet 15-year-old kid who competed at his first Paralympics in 2004, {{into one of the}} greats of Australian Paralympic sport. He has become an outstanding ambassador for the Paralympic movement, a leader of the Paralympic swim team and our most successful athlete ever." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Like!" [...] she gasped. [...] "I don't {{believe that}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>ever</b> {{imagined}} anything like it. Do {{you know that}} I have a big bathroom of my own, with a marble floor, and a sitting-room so beautiful that I am afraid almost to look into it.

2500|$|Five {{months after}} the fire, Great White started a benefit tour, saying a prayer at the {{beginning}} of each concert for the friends and families affected by the incident and giving a portion of the proceeds to the Station Family Fund. In 2003, and again in 2005, the band stated they had not performed the song [...] "Desert Moon" [...] since the tragedy. [...] "I don't think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> sing that song again," [...] said lead vocalist and founder Jack Russell, while guitarist Mark Kendall stated [...] "We haven't played that song. Things that bring back memories of that night we try to stay away from. And that song reminds us of that night. We haven't played it since then and probably never will." [...] By 2009, the band had resumed performing the song.|$|E

She later wrote in her autobiography The Million Dollar Mermaid that [...] "he was smart, handsome, dependable...and dull. I respected his intelligence, and his dedication to a future career in medicine. He loved me, or so he said, and even asked me to marry him." [...] They were married in the San Francisco suburb of Los Altos on June 27, 1940. On their split she said [...] "I found, much to my relief, that all I needed for my emotional and personal security was my own resolve and determination. I didn't need a marriage and a ring. I had come to realize all too quickly that Leonard Kovner {{was not a man}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> really love." [...] They divorced on September 12, 1944.|$|E
2500|$|Shantel VanSanten portrays Quinn James, Haley's free {{spirited}} older sister. Fans were unreceptive to {{the character}} at first, but eventually warmed to her. [...] "It's funny. I feel that. I struggle because I take it personally. Obviously, it is a personal thing. Quinn is a character that the writers and myself have developed", said VanSanten. [...] "And {{there was no way}} that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>ever</b> change the way that we started last season where I came into the picture all of a sudden, crying all the time. It was a really emotional thing and it wasn't something that we could really explore a whole lot of. So, I think it was a hard place for people to accept as I came in. I wasn't bubbly and happy. You know?" [...] Quinn is introduced in season 7 when she moves back to Tree Hill after her marriage breaks down.|$|E
