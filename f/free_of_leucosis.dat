40|$|The {{concentration}} of the transmitting agent <b>of</b> <b>leucosis</b> in fowls, as determined by titration, is approximately {{the same in the}} suspensions of blood cells and in cell-free plasma; the smallest amount <b>of</b> plasma producing <b>leucosis</b> was 0. 000001 cc. and of cell suspension 0. 00001 cc. This observation excludes the possibility that transmission <b>of</b> <b>leucosis</b> by plasma is due to the presence of a small number of leucemic cells in the plasma. The success of inoculations with plasma (20 to 28 per cent of fowls) is, within wide limits, independent of the amount injected (10 – 1 to 10 – 6 cc.). The percentage of successful inoculations with varying quantities of plasma is lower than with corresponding amounts of suspensions of cells (33 to 71 per cent). When plasma containing the transmitting agent is injected in decreasing amounts the incubation period <b>of</b> the <b>leucosis</b> is conspicuously lengthened. With decreasing amounts of a suspension of leucemic cells the incubation period is not so frequently nor so greatly prolonged...|$|R

40|$|Myeloid leucosis and erythroleucosis can be {{transmitted}} from one bird to others by emulsions of infiltrated organs, whole blood cells, and plasma. Inoculation is more often successful with blood cells or with whole blood than with plasma or with emulsions of organs infiltrated as the result <b>of</b> <b>leucosis.</b> Inoculation with material from a bird with myeloid or with erythroleucosis produces both myeloid and erythroleucosis, and in many instances mixed forms with characters of both. Evidence is wanting that lymphoid leucosis {{is caused by the}} agent that transmits myeloid and erythroleucosis. The occurrence <b>of</b> lymphoid <b>leucosis</b> among the birds inoculated with material from myeloid or erythroleucosis may be explained as spontaneous disease. Injury to cellular structure by treatment with distilled water or by repeated freezing and thawing does not destroy the agent that transmits the disease. Berkefeld filtrates have failed to transmit regularly myeloid or erythroleucosis.

40|$|AbstractNovel immune {{photoluminescent}} biosensor, {{based on}} TiO 2 nanoparticles, for retroviral leucosis detection has been developed. The photoluminescence spectra were excited by {{solid state laser}} with wavelength 355 nm and measured {{in the range of}} 370 - 800 nm. Original photoluminescence spectrum of TiO 2 nanoparticles showed wide maximum at 515 nm. The biosensitive layer was formed by immobilization <b>of</b> retroviral <b>leucosis</b> antigens on the surface of TiO 2 nanoparticles. Immobilization of antigens on TiO 2 surface led to UV-shift of photoluminescence spectrum and increase of PL intensity. The response to different concentrations <b>of</b> retroviral <b>leucosis</b> antibodies has been measured. The decrease of spectrum intensity and IR-shift were observed after antibodies adsorption on biosensor surface. The experimental dependences of maximum shift and intensity changes versus antibodies concentration were obtained...|$|R
40|$|The agent {{transmitting}} leucosis readily passed {{all types}} of silicious filters. Filtration is particularly successful when the plasma is freed from particles and substances that would otherwise obstruct the pores of the filter. Filtration through fine filters seems to be facilitated by preceding filtration through coarse filters. A comparison of the periods <b>of</b> incubation <b>of</b> <b>leucosis</b> produced by unfiltered plasma and plasma passed through silicious filters shows {{that as a result}} of filtration, the incubation periods are somewhat prolonged. This suggests a slight or moderate decrease in the concentration of the transmitting agent in the plasma caused by filtration. Filtration tests through collodion membranes indicate that the agent transmitting leucosis is much smaller than the virus of bovine pleuropneumonia (250 mµ) and that it approximates the size of bacteriophage...|$|R

40|$|Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is {{a member}} of the Delta retro virus genus (family Retroviridae) and can cause {{persistent}} lymphocytosis and lymphosarcoma in cattle that is described as enzootic bovine leucosis (EBL). This disease causes significant economic losses associated with the costs of control and eradication programs. Control programs <b>of</b> <b>leucosis</b> are based on the screening of cows by serological methods and removing the infected cows. The aim of this study was to evaluate the seroprevalence of bovine leukemia virus in cattle in Khuzestan province. Serum samples from 527 cattle were randomly collected in Ahvaz, Baghmalek, Shooshtar, Gotvand, Shadegan, Hendijan, Behbahan, Ramhormoz and Susangerd cities and were examined by ELISA assay. Seroperevalence rate of bovine leukemia virus was 6. 64 % (95 % CI: 4. 51 - 8. 77). Statistical analysis indicated no significant association between infection and age or breed. Relative frequency of infection was higher in female cows than males, but this difference was not significant and odds of infection in female cows than males were 2. 6 (95 % CI: 0. 35 - 19. 59). Prevalence rate of infection between industrial (15 %) and nonindustrial (3. 4 %) husbandry was significantly different (...|$|R

40|$|AS YET {{there is}} no {{critical}} evidence • * * • to show definitely that the agent <b>of</b> avian <b>leucosis</b> {{is or is not}} transmitted through the egg. There has, however, been accumulated considerable circumstantial evidence to support both possibilities, especially the former concept. This is not unexpected, because positive data {{are more likely to be}} published than are negative data. I t is obvious that for a complete understanding of the avian leu-cosis complex more information as to the possibility of egg-borne transmission of the etiological agent must be provided. In order for the disease to develop, two conditions must be satisfied. The infective agent must be present and the host must be genetically susceptible. Natural (ge-netic) resistance is a relative factor and its normal expression can be overridden by an excess of the agent or exposure. Such happenings'occur regularly and are re-sponsible for variations in incidence of the disease within a flock during different years, as well as in inoculation experi-ments wherein the natural barriers to in-fection are bypassed. Experiments or tests to control tjie disease by breeding usually provide adequate proof of the in-fluence of natural resistance to the dis-ease, but in some of these tests the appar-ent improvement in genetic resistance may actually be more the result of a re-duced exposure. I t is imperative that these relationships be considered in the interpretation of various reports concern-ing transmission <b>of</b> avian <b>leucosis</b> through the egg.
