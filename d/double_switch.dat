5|$|The New York Mets {{concluded}} {{the regular season}} {{with a record of}} 100–60 while the Dodgers had a 94–67 record. The Mets had won ten of the eleven head-to-head regular season contests and were the favorite in the series. On October 4, 1988, Hershiser posted eight scoreless innings in Game 1 of the 1988 NL Championship Series (bringing his unofficial total of consecutive scoreless innings to 67) before surrendering runs in the 9th inning. In both the third and sixth inning the Mets got two runners on base only to have the third out recorded on infield grounders to Hershiser. In the ninth inning, Gregg Jefferies led off with a single on a sinker down the middle and reached second base on a ground out in a hit and run play with Keith Hernandez. Jefferies, a rookie, recorded his third hit in four at bats in his first ever appearance against Hershiser. With Jefferies on second, Darryl Strawberry posted an RBI double on a pitch he described as up in the strike zone. Strawberry had fouled off four fastballs before getting what Lasorda called a hanging curveball. After Hershiser gave up a run in the ninth inning 100 pitches into his performance, pitching coach Perranoski removed him from the game by signaling for a <b>double</b> <b>switch</b> before getting to the mound to talk to Hershiser. The Dodgers' bullpen had led the league in saves that year. Howell had recorded 18 consecutive scoreless innings in relief. Howell's scoreless streak was longer in calendar days, his last runs allowed occurring on August 11. It had been 35 days since anyone had scored a run against Hershiser. Controversially, Mets pitcher David Cone attributed Hershiser's success to luck after the Mets rallied to score against him in the ninth inning. The Mets went on to add two more runs on Gary Carter's shallow fly ball that center fielder John Shelby could not secure until it first hit the ground. The ball bounced out of his glove as he lunged for the catch, yielding the tying and winning runs. Despite the results, Hershiser's scoreless inning streak in the regular season was still intact at 59 consecutive innings, as the runs scored against him on October 4 were in the postseason.|$|E
25|$|The Mets made a <b>double</b> <b>switch</b> {{in the top}} of the ninth, with Mazzilli taking Strawberry's spot {{in right}} field while Rick Aguilera came in to face Jim Rice, Evans and Rich Gedman. After {{striking}} out Rice, Aguilera saw shortstop Kevin Elster misplay the ball at shortstop and allow Evans to reach base. He escaped trouble when Gedman grounded to Backman, who turned a double play with Elster and Hernandez to keep the game tied.|$|E
25|$|The Bulldogs' last {{pay-per-view}} was the 1988 Survivor Series. They wrestled in a twenty-man (10 team) tag team elimination match {{notable for}} Mr. Fuji turning against his Tag Team Champions Demolition (Ax and Smash) and joining their rival The Powers of Pain (The Barbarian and The Warlord) in a <b>double</b> <b>switch</b> with Demolition turning {{face and the}} Powers of Pain turning heel. The Powers of Pain won the match by eliminating the heel team Los Conquistadores, thus giving their team (which included The Bulldogs who had earlier been eliminated when Smash pinned Dynamite) the victory.|$|E

25|$|The batting {{order in}} {{baseball}} must be declared {{before the game}} begins, and can only be changed if a substitution occurs. Batting out of turn is a rule violation resulting in a penalty. When a manager makes a substitution, the new player must occupy the same place in the batting order as the old one. To allow more complicated changes in batting order, managers may use the <b>double</b> <b>switch,</b> substituting for two players simultaneously. This is typically used to replace the pitcher but put the new pitcher in {{a spot in the}} batting order that will not come up to bat soon, previously occupied by another fielder (pitchers are almost uniformly poor hitters much like most specialist bowlers are poor batsmen). However, the rule remains that no individual player can ever change his position in the batting order within the same game.|$|E
25|$|In both sports, {{strategy}} {{varies with}} the game situation. In baseball, pitcher, batter and fielders all play far differently in the late innings of a close game (e.g., waiting for walks, trying for stolen bases or the squeeze play to score a decisive run) than they do early, or when one team has already scored many more runs than the other (where batters will be likely to swing at many more pitches and try for extra-base hits and even home runs). The number, speed, and position of baserunners, which have no equivalent in cricket, all dramatically change the strategies used by pitcher and batter. A runner on first base must decide how large a lead {{to take off the}} base—the larger the lead, the greater the chance of advancing on a stolen base or batted ball, but also the greater the risk of being picked off by the pitcher. In leagues which do not allow designated hitters, strategic thinking also enters into substitutions. For example, in the <b>double</b> <b>switch,</b> the substitution of a relief pitcher is combined with the substitution of a pinch hitter who takes the pitcher's spot in the batting order so that the new pitcher will come to bat later (as almost all pitchers are poor hitters much like most specialist bowlers are poor batsmen). Since players may not return to the game after being substituted for, a manager cannot take lightly the decision when and if to substitute a better-fielding but worse-hitting player if his team is ahead.|$|E
500|$|Two years later, in May 2016, game {{developer}} Tyler Hogle {{was finding}} himself bored between jobs. He had previously worked on ports for two other Digital Pictures games, <b>Double</b> <b>Switch</b> (1993) and Quarterback Attack (1995). A friend suggested that Hogle recreate Night Trap and post it online anonymously {{to see what}} interest it gathered. Inspired by the idea, Hogle worked quickly {{and was able to}} recreate all of disc one to play on a smart phone within three days. He posted a short video of his work online, and some gaming websites published stories on the video and contacted Tom Zito to ask if he was involved. Hogle got into contact with Zito, and the two began working towards a full release. The original source code and 1987 master footage is lost. Riley, however, possessed a copy of the timed master footage and provided it to Hogle. Because the footage was already timed, it was easier for Hogle to develop, however he had to replay the original game multiple times to learn what actions triggered which scenes.|$|E

50|$|<b>Double</b> <b>switching,</b> <b>double</b> cutting, or double {{breaking}} is {{the practice}} of using a multipole switch to close or open both {{the positive and negative}} sides of a DC electrical circuit, or both the hot and neutral sides of an AC circuit. This technique is used to prevent shock hazard in electric devices connected with unpolarised AC power plugs and sockets. <b>Double</b> <b>switching</b> is a crucial safety engineering practice in railway signalling, wherein it is used to ensure that a single false feed of current to a relay is unlikely to cause a wrong side failure. It is an example of using redundancy to increase safety and reduce the likelihood of failure, analogous to <b>double</b> insulation. <b>Double</b> <b>switching</b> increases the cost and complexity of systems in which it is employed, for example by extra relay contacts and extra relays, so the technique is applied selectively where it can provide a cost-effective safety improvement.|$|R

500|$|After the injury, Milwaukee's {{general manager}} Harry Dalton said that Bates [...] "is {{expected}} to join [...] by game time [...] ", adding [...] "he won't {{be in the}} starting lineup, but he could play if necessary". Bates made his MLB debut on August 17 {{as a part of}} a <b>double</b> <b>switch</b> against the Boston Red Sox: when Dan Plesac replaced Tony Fossas as the pitcher, Bates entered the game for Gus Polidor. Wade Boggs hit a ground ball to Bates, but he committed an error that allowed Boggs to reach and Dwight Evans to advance to third base. No runs were scored in the inning and the Brewers won, 8–4. Bates made his first career start two days later, and his first MLB hit came on August 20 when he reached base on an infield single. Bates then stole second base, and scored on a single by Robin Yount. While he was running out a base hit on August 22, Bates slipped on wet grass and suffered a separated right shoulder. The Brewers placed him on the 15-day DL; as a replacement, Milwaukee acquired Ed Romero from the Atlanta Braves. Bates returned to the team for three more games in September before the end of the season. Over seven MLB games, he batted [...]214 with three hits, three runs, and two steals.|$|E
500|$|On May 9, Rentería {{was called}} up to the Marlins {{following}} an injury to shortstop Kurt Abbott. His first game came on May 10, in a 4–2 win over the Colorado Rockies, {{when he entered the}} game in the ninth inning as part of a <b>double</b> <b>switch.</b> He did not have any at bats in that game, though, and he was just a backup infielder when he first came up because Alex Arias had replaced Abbott as the everyday shortstop. However, Rentería replaced Arias as the starting shortstop on May 19 against the Chicago Cubs. He got his first hit (a single) in his first at bat (against Steve Trachsel) in a 3–2 Marlins victory. He got four hits in a game {{for the first time on}} June 10 in a 5–2 win over the Montreal Expos. His first home run came the next day, off Ugueth Urbina of the Expos, in a 3–2 loss. Rentería did so well as a shortstop that the Marlins moved Abbott over to second base when he came off the disabled list. On June 23, Rentería strained a hamstring on a groundout in the sixth inning of a 5–3 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates. He was placed on the disabled list the next day, but he remained the starting shortstop when he returned on July 11. From July 25 to August 16 he had a 22-game hitting streak, which was the longest for a rookie since Jerome Walton of the Chicago Cubs had a thirty-game streak in [...] Rentería finished the season with a [...]309 batting average, 68 runs scored, and sixteen stolen bases in 106 games. He was second behind Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Todd Hollandsworth in National League (NL) Rookie of the Year Award balloting.|$|E
2500|$|Needing baserunners to stay alive, Carter {{provided}} a spark by lining a single into left field. Aguilera's spot was up next {{due to the}} <b>double</b> <b>switch</b> and Mets manager Davey Johnson, running low on players, sent someone into the clubhouse to retrieve Kevin Mitchell to pinch hit. Mitchell {{had gone into the}} clubhouse after Hernandez recorded the second out, allegedly to book a flight home for later that night. Despite the rush, the rookie utility man came through with a single. Knight was the next batter and, after two pitches, he faced a count of no balls and two strikes. [...] The Red Sox were one strike away from the championship. [...] But on Schiraldi's third pitch, Knight singled, scoring Carter and advancing the speedy Mitchell to third.|$|E

50|$|While the <b>double</b> <b>switch</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the National League, the designated hitter (DH) rule has effectively eliminated the advantages of the <b>double</b> <b>switch</b> in the games using American League rules—so the <b>double</b> <b>switch</b> is rarely used in AL games. The designated hitter's role is to bat in the pitcher's spot in the lineup. Major League rules do not allow a multiple substitution involving a DH to alter the lineup position of the DH. Although uncommon, it is possible to forgo the DH privilege (e.g. if the DH becomes a position player, usually due to injury to another player), and then utilize the <b>double</b> <b>switch</b> later with that player. It can also be used by an AL team playing on the road during interleague play or the World Series, because MLB rules call for the rules of the home team to be used when teams from different leagues meet (so there is no DH when the NL team is the home team).|$|E

50|$|In baseball, the <b>double</b> <b>switch</b> {{is a type}} {{of player}} substitution, usually {{performed}} by a team while playing defense. The <b>double</b> <b>switch</b> is typically used to make a pitching substitution, while simultaneously placing the incoming pitcher in a more favorable spot in the batting order than was occupied by the outgoing pitcher. (On the assumption that the pitcher will be a poor hitter, the incoming pitcher will generally take the spot in the batting order of a position player who has recently been put out, so as to avoid the pitcher's making a plate appearance {{in the next couple of}} innings.) To perform a <b>double</b> <b>switch</b> (or any other substitution), the ball must be dead.|$|E
