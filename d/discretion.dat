5|$|When {{a public}} {{authority}} fetters its <b>discretion,</b> it {{can either be}} said to have failed to exercise its discretionary power or to have been subject to external influences. In the Singapore High Court decision Lines International Holding (S) Pte. Ltd. v. Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (1997), two distinct forms of fettering of <b>discretion</b> were recognized: fettering of <b>discretion</b> through rigid adherence to a policy, and fettering of <b>discretion</b> by an unlawful delegation of authority. These two forms of fettering of <b>discretion</b> have been said to represent two elements defining the concept of <b>discretion</b> in administrative law – the first form relates to freedom of choice, and second form the notion of one's personal <b>discretion.</b>|$|E
5|$|However, {{the judge}} noted that whether a {{discretionary}} power {{is subject to}} any precedent fact depends {{on the construction of}} the legislation creating the power, and that it is open to Parliament to express its intention in plain and unequivocal words to take a <b>discretion</b> conferred on a public authority out of the precedent fact category, thus excluding judicial review of the <b>discretion</b> even if the liberty of a person affected by the exercise of the <b>discretion</b> is implicated. On the facts of the case, the <b>discretion</b> conferred on the President and the Minister for Home Affairs by sections 8 and 10 of the Internal Security Act to detain without trial persons believed to threaten national security, to suspend detentions and to revoke such suspensions, was held to fall outside the precedent fact category. Consequently, the Court could not go beyond determining if the detention decisions violated administrative law rules relating to illegality, irrationality or procedural impropriety.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Appeal held {{further that}} as the <b>discretion</b> conferred by section 8 of the ISA {{involved}} national security, {{the issue of whether}} detention was necessary should be left solely to executive <b>discretion.</b> However, the Court referred to two United Kingdom decisions which stood for the principle that courts are not precluded from determining whether a decision is in fact based on grounds of national security. Therefore, the court could still determine whether the matters relied on by the executive in the exercise of <b>discretion</b> were indeed within the scope of section 8.|$|E

5|$|In Thio Li-ann's view, {{it appears}} that the High Court allowed the matter to be decided {{according}} to the subjective <b>discretion</b> of the Minister. The only explanation given for deregistration was that the Jehovah's Witnesses' refusal to perform national service was contrary to the public interest. The Court did not require the executive to elaborate on exactly how a failure to perform national service would be contrary to public interest. It accepted the executive's <b>discretion</b> to derogate a fundamental right without a close scrutiny of the executive's rationale and explanations.|$|E

5|$|In {{the case}} of ministerial <b>discretion,</b> it has been {{established}} in Carltona Ltd. v. Commissioner of Works (1943) that it is not unlawful for a civil servant to take a decision on behalf of the minister, even where a statute confers <b>discretion</b> on a minister. Parliament will expect only that the power is to be exercised by an appropriate official. However, the minister is ultimately responsible for decisions taken on his or her behalf. While there has been discussion in case law about whether a minister should be required to personally exercise <b>discretion</b> in decisions that affect a person's liberty, the courts have usually been reluctant to hold so. Such a requirement, however, has been made by way of statutes which require the minister to act personally.|$|E
5|$|In {{the seminal}} Court of Appeal {{decision}} Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), the respondents submitted that the President's <b>discretion</b> under section 8(1) was subjective, {{and so was}} not open to review by the courts. The appellants argued that the <b>discretion</b> was objective, and thus {{a court of law}} could review the grounds on which the <b>discretion</b> had been exercised. The Court held that an objective test applied to the subjectively worded powers in sections 8 and 10, and hence the exercise of these powers was normally challengeable on the GCHQ grounds of judicial review. In coming to this decision, it disapproved of a 1971 High Court decision, Lee Mau Seng v. Minister for Home Affairs, which had held to the contrary. While the Court's views regarding the applicability of an objective test were obiter, later Singapore decisions have confirmed this as the correct approach. It gave several reasons for its decision. First, the reasoning in cases supporting a subjective test was found to be questionable, and, secondly, such a test was inconsistent with Article 12(1) of the Constitution. Finally, the notion of a subjective or unfettered <b>discretion</b> was contrary {{to the rule of law}} and all powers had legal limits.|$|E

5|$|Setting up an {{exchange}} gives a state partial <b>discretion</b> on standards and prices of insurance.

5|$|The English {{common law}} {{position}} that a public body cannot fetter its <b>discretion</b> by abdicating its responsibility and powers to another was discussed and adopted in Lines International. The general rules that Justice Prakash enunciated {{in the case}} are that, first, a public body has the duty to exercise <b>discretion</b> by itself; it cannot abdicate this responsibility by taking orders from other bodies unless it is under a legal duty to do so. Therefore, a condition in its policy {{that appeared to be}} a direction by the PSA to itself to take orders from either the Gambling Suppression Branch ("GSB") of the Singapore Police Force or STPB to deny berths to cruise vessels was a fetter on PSA's exercise of <b>discretion</b> and was held to be invalid. However, the invalid condition alone did not mean that the PSA had in fact fettered its <b>discretion.</b> The High Court stated that while the PSA had agreed to take orders from the GSB and STPB {{on the basis of the}} invalid condition, whether it had in fact done so was another matter. On the evidence, the Court went on to find that the PSA had in fact made its own decision in the matter.|$|E
