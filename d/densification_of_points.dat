40|$|Several {{automatic}} methods {{exist for}} creating 3 D point clouds extracted from 2 D photos. In manycases, {{the result is}} a sparse point cloud, unevenly distributed over the scene. After determining the coordinates <b>of</b> the same <b>point</b> in two images of an object, the 3 D positionof that point can be calculated using knowledge of camera data and relative orientation. A model created from a unevenly distributed point clouds may loss detail and precision in thesparse areas. The aim of this thesis is to study methods for <b>densification</b> <b>of</b> <b>point</b> clouds. This thesis contains a literature study over different methods for extracting matched point pairs,and an implementation of Least Square Template Matching (LSTM) with a set of improvementtechniques. The implementation is evaluated on a set of different scenes of various difficulty. LSTM is implemented by working on a dense grid <b>of</b> <b>points</b> in an image and Wallis filtering isused to enhance contrast. The matched point correspondences are evaluated with parameters fromthe optimization in order to keep good matches and discard bad ones. The purpose is to find detailsclose to a plane in the images, or on plane-like surfaces. A set of extensions to LSTM is implemented in the aim of improving the quality of the matchedpoints. The seed points are improved by Transformed Normalized Cross Correlation (TNCC) andMultiple Seed Points (MSP) for the same template, and then tested to see if they converge to thesame result. Wallis filtering is used to increase the contrast in the image. The quality of the extractedpoints are evaluated with respect to correlation with other optimization parameters and comparisonof standard deviation in x- and y- direction. If a point is rejected, the option to try again with a largertemplate size exists, called Adaptive Template Size (ATS) ...|$|R
40|$|Because of its simple composition, vast {{availability}} in pure formand ease of processing, {{vitreous silica}} {{is often used}} as a model tostudy the physics of amorphous solids. Research in amorphous silica is also motivated by its ubiquity in modern technology, a prominent example being as bulk material in transmissive and diffractive optics for high-power laser applications such as inertial confinement fusion (ICF) 1, 2. In these applications,stability under high-fluence laser irradiation is a key requirement 3,with optical breakdown occurring when the fluence of the beam {{is higher than the}} laser-induced damage threshold (LIDT) of the material 3.

40|$|<b>Densification</b> <b>of</b> access <b>points</b> (APs) in {{wireless}} {{local area}} networks (WLANs) increases the interference and the contention domains of each AP due to multiple overlapped basic service sets (BSSs). Consequently, high interference from multiple co-channel BSS {{at the target}} AP impairs system performance. To improve system performance {{in the presence of}} multi-BSSs interference, we propose a decentralized AP selection scheme that takes interference at the candidate APs into account and selects AP that offers best signal-interference-plus noise ratio (SINR). In the proposed algorithm, the AP selection process is distributed at the user stations (STAs) and is based on the estimated SINR in the downlink. Estimating SINR in the downlink helps capture the effect of interference from neighboring BSSs or APs. Based on a simulated large-scale 802. 11 network, the proposed scheme outperforms the strongest signal first (SSF) AP selection scheme used in current 802. 11 standards as well as the mean probe delay (MPD) AP selection algorithm in [3]; it achieves 99 % and 43 % gains in aggregate throughput over SSF and MPD, respectively. While increasing STA densification, the proposed scheme is shown to increase aggregate network performance. Comment: 17 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

By this way, decision makers could understand the progress of a construction project better and, thus, make quicker and more accurate decisions. Moreover, to facilitate the automation of progress monitoring (Golparvar-Fard et al. 2011 b) when these models are overlaid on 4 D models or BIMs, the probability of observing expected as-built element increases and related errors of inaccuracy decrease because these models are denser. Thus, probability functions can detect discrepancies with high probability that is closer to reality.

30|$|Our {{findings}} show a strong potential for this technique {{to be applied}} {{in a variety of}} field settings. We anticipate further development of the uncertainty model in future research. Our goal is to expand the capability to densify the anchor points in areas that are more topographically complex and test by overfitting the surface how well the uncertainty model is performing in these locations. At present, it is not clear if the use <b>of</b> sparse <b>points</b> (for example, techniques that rely on interpolation from topographic maps) under sample the topographic surface and therefore, do not accurately represent the surface or the spatially variable uncertainty in the measurement of topographic change. We intend to expand the capabilities of the model by conducting further software simulations that analyze and visualize topographic change over time using the varied <b>densification</b> <b>of</b> anchor <b>points.</b> The advances in the uncertainty model will then be further evaluated using real-world data from a variety of sources. For example, ALS data {{can be used in a}} fashion to simulate different types of data by varying the data density, data noise, etc. to examine known differences in the data and the capability to measures these data perturbations using the refine uncertainty model. Once these items have been worked out our intent is to apply the uncertainty model to the real-world topographic and environmental changes within various environmental settings that include more topographically complex areas like mountainous environments versus less topographic complex locales such as barrier islands.|$|R
40|$|Calculation and {{measurement}} of performance parameters of public lighting are {{performed in a}} grid <b>of</b> <b>points</b> defined by the CIE publication 140 [1] and European standard EN 13201 - 3. [2] Calculation grid defined in these documents was created {{at a time of}} less powerful computers and less precise measuring technology. Distance between two adjacent calculating points may be even 3 m, depending on the geometry of the road. This arrangement is too sparse {{in view of the fact}} that presently used computers can cope with much more denser grids in a shorter operation time and the measurement can be performed by luminance analyzers with more accuracy as well. Between the results of the calculation with different grid densities <b>of</b> calculation <b>points</b> there can be significant differences. This fact can be influenced by new optical systems and some LED luminaires which, as it was found out by measurements, may contain various local extremes in the LIDC. When calculating the performance parameters of public lighting with given grid density these extremes may fall between calculation points and thus they are not included in the calculation. The solution is to propose a new density <b>of</b> calculation <b>points</b> which would be designed with respect to current possibilities of computer and measuring technology.

These sites have to be reconstructed in terms of environment (seabed) and content (artifacts) by performing bathymetric and photogrammetric surveys on the real site and matching points between geolocalized pictures. The base idea behind using Mixed Reality techniques is to offer archaeologists and general public new insights on the reconstructed archaeological sites allowing archaeologists to study directly from within the virtual site and allowing the general public to immersively explore a realistic reconstruction of the sites. Both activities are based on the same VR engine but drastically differ in the way they present information. General public activities emphasize the visually and auditory realistic aspect of the reconstruction while archaeologists activities emphasize functional aspects focused on the cargo study rather than realism which leads to the development of two parallel VR demonstrators. This paper will focus on several key points developed for the reconstruction process as well as both VR demonstrators (archaeological and general public) issues. The first developed key <b>point</b> concerns the <b>densification</b> <b>of</b> seabed <b>points</b> obtained through photogrammetry in order to obtain high quality terrain reproduction.
