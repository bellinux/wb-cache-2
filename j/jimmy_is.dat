5|$|The Gunmen cleverly trick Agent Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) into {{coming to}} Las Vegas using a {{text to speech}} program. Their friend Jimmy uses his special {{technique}} for gaining access to a secret meeting room where he believes he will learn about new assassination techniques employed by the government. However, <b>Jimmy</b> <b>is</b> discovered and injected with a mystery drug which forces him to kill himself. Meanwhile, Byers discovers that Susanne is alive and well, but has seemingly become a secretive government agent.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the other}} Gangers have regrouped, led by Ganger Cleaves. She realizes {{that she is}} {{suffering}} from the same terminal illness that the human Cleaves is suffering, and questions their need to kill their counterparts. The group is spurred on by Ganger Jennifer who insists the humans must die. As Ganger Cleaves orders her group to stay {{one step ahead of}} the humans, the Ganger Jennifer kills the real Jennifer, and then stages a fight with another Ganger Jennifer to fool Rory that she is the human version. Ganger Jennifer leads Rory to a console, claiming it will restore power when instead it disables the cooling system for the acid, making it dangerously unstable. She then convinces Rory to lead the human group into the acid storage chamber and traps them inside; crewman <b>Jimmy</b> <b>is</b> killed trying to stall the acid release.|$|E
5|$|Tensions run {{high among}} the band members, as Joey begins seducing Imelda, Natalie and Bernie, and Deco grows {{increasingly}} obnoxious and unruly. The band performs at another venue where, {{at the end}} of one song, Billy accidentally knocks over his hi-hat cymbals, leading to a heated argument between him and Deco. Billy leaves the band in fear of going to jail if he beats up Deco—much to Jimmy's frustration—and Mickah replaces him as the band's drummer. During the band's next performance at a roller disco, <b>Jimmy</b> <b>is</b> confronted by Duffy, who demands payment for the equipment he provided the band. Mickah intervenes and violently attacks Duffy, who is escorted out. Jimmy then goes on stage and introduces the band, which elicits boisterous cheers from the audience.|$|E

25|$|Another trope of operas is the deus ex machina, {{in which}} the protagonist is saved {{at the last minute}} by divine intervention. This is a useful {{technique}} to quickly wrap up a story and make a happy ending, and has been used in drama many times. In Mahagonny, though there are no supernatural occurrences for most of the opera, there is in fact a deus ex machina; God himself comes to Mahagonny right before <b>Jimmy</b> <b>is</b> executed. The typical opera would have God solving all the problems {{just in time for the}} end of the opera, but Mahagonnys god does not. He does not even acknowledge that <b>Jimmy</b> <b>is</b> tied up and ready to be killed, but at least tries to fix the moral problems in Mahagonny. He tries to convince them to give up their degraded way of life, but the residents all refuse the offer. God then tells them literally to go to hell, but the people are not even offended; they proclaim that they already are in hell so that is no punishment. After fixing nothing, God then lets Jimmy have his say. Jimmy realizes that money did not buy him happiness or freedom, and he has learned his lesson. However, God does not spare him even then, and <b>Jimmy</b> <b>is</b> executed off-stage.|$|E

60|$|Jackson wiped a spot {{of liquor}} from his white shirt and gave the boy a {{sympathetic}} glance. Jackson was thin, dark-skinned and grave, and {{although he did not}} talk much about himself, <b>Jimmy</b> understood he <b>was</b> rather an important gentleman in Carolina. Stannard had indicated something like this. Stannard and <b>Jimmy</b> <b>were</b> frankly English, but <b>Jimmy</b> <b>was</b> young and the other's hair was touched by white.|$|R
25|$|Jimmy Olsen {{locates the}} Red Hood, Jason Todd, and {{interviews}} {{him about the}} death of Duela Dent. Jason suggests that he interviews the Joker in Arkham Asylum. The Joker states that he never had a daughter, and alludes to a larger conspiracy. While calling Lois to inform her of his dead end, <b>Jimmy</b> <b>is</b> attacked by Killer Croc. To Jimmy's surprise, his body stretches, similar to Plastic Man and the Elongated Man, meaning Killer Croc cannot penetrate his skin.|$|E
25|$|John Henry Irons tests Jimmy's powers using metahuman biofeedback, but {{the display}} generates {{complicated}} {{images of the}} Source Wall and alternate Earths. On his way home, Jimmy meets two members of Cadmus, who offer their assistance, take him back to their HQ, and run tests on him. Jimmy's powers go haywire, and he runs off to keep himself from hurting anyone. He encounters the Newsboy Legion, who offer him shelter. Jimmy encounters Forager, who asks for help in stopping {{the killing of the}} New Gods. On Apokolips, Jimmy and Forager fight Parademons and are overpowered and taken prisoner. The Monitors decide that <b>Jimmy</b> <b>is</b> not meant to control his powers and that he is being manipulated. <b>Jimmy</b> <b>is</b> sent to the slave pits, where his overseers are ordered to torture him; Mister Miracle comes to his aid. Unable to discern the nature of Jimmy's powers with his Mother Box, Mister Miracle gambles by dropping Olsen into a fire pit. Jimmy survives by assuming a turtle-like form. Jimmy locates Forager, who then attacks him. Jimmy duplicates the powers of a Mother Box to restore Forager's sanity. When the two of them are confronted by Bernadeth, Jimmy manages to open a Boom Tube and returns to Earth with Forager, whereupon he kisses her.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{noticeable}} methods Brecht uses are the inscriptions {{at the beginning of}} most of the scenes. Before the majority of the scenes, there is a short summary of that scene recited to the audience. By being already aware of what will happen, the audience can then better concentrate on {{what is going on in}} the scene. Often, Brecht will also have seemingly bizarre events occur, seemingly just to keep the audience unable to guess what will happen next. For example, <b>Jimmy</b> <b>is</b> going crazy at having nothing to do, when all of a sudden a hurricane starts heading towards Mahagonny. The audience is forced to give up concentrating on how Jimmy feels and think about what the meaning of this sudden hurricane is.|$|E
50|$|M.F. Horn 4&5: Live at <b>Jimmy's</b> <b>is</b> the 6th {{big band}} album by Canadian jazz trumpeter Maynard Ferguson for Columbia Records.

50|$|<b>Jimmy</b> <b>was</b> sent to Laastekist, Pennsylvania to {{investigate}} the sightings of Punisher. While in Laastekist, <b>Jimmy</b> <b>was</b> disgusted when the other Cullen Family members shot and seemingly killed Payback and Lynn Michaels. Dean Swaybrick then arrived and killed the Cullen Family members present. Then Dean put the gun to Jimmy's head until Dean's fellow agents fled. This distraction gave Jimmy the opportunity to steal Dean's gun and shoot him. <b>Jimmy</b> <b>was</b> mortified after this and approached Dean's body. As Jimmy kneeled over Dean's corpse, he is {{shot in the back}} by Vigil's Blackwell and left for dead.|$|R

25|$|Donnie takes {{money from}} the Solomon & Solomon safe. As he drives away, he decides to return the money, but discovers he cannot get back in as his key broke off in the lock. While {{climbing}} a utility pole {{to get on the}} roof, he is seen by a passing Jim. Suddenly, frogs begin falling from the sky, with multiple consequences: as <b>Jimmy</b> <b>is</b> about to shoot himself, frogs fall through his skylight, causing him to shoot the TV which sets his house on fire; Rose crashes her car in front of Claudia's apartment, but makes it inside and reconciles with her daughter; Earl dies as Frank watches the frogs; Linda's ambulance crashes in front of the emergency room; and Donnie is knocked from the pole and smashes his teeth, then is dragged to safety by Jim.|$|E
25|$|In , {{where the}} Kents never found Clark, Lois is {{selected}} by Green Lantern {{to provide the}} Justice League with some positive media presentation after a recent propaganda campaign focuses {{on the idea that}} many modern metahumans are alien invaders. Tracking recent kidnapped heroes to a secret base, Lois is introduced to the Kents, who provide a safe house for various heroes after Lana Lang smuggled them out of the facility, and later discovers that the true mastermind behind the conspiracy is Jimmy Olsen, mutated into a Kryptonian through genetic experiments carried out based on DNA samples found in Kal-El's crashed and abandoned ship. <b>Jimmy</b> <b>is</b> finally defeated by Kal-El, who was here raised by an Amish couple until their deaths at Olsen's hands, with Lois writing about how Kal-El's time with the Kents helped him accept his abilities and grow into the Superman he should have been.|$|E
25|$|Tensely, {{people watch}} for the hurricane's arrival. The men sing a hymn-like admonition not to be afraid. Jim meditatively compares Nature's savagery to the far greater destructiveness of Man. Why do we build, he asks, {{if not for the}} {{pleasure}} of destroying? Since Man can outdo any hurricane, fear makes no sense. For the sake of human satisfaction, nothing should be forbidden: If you want another man's money, his house or his wife, knock him down and take it; do what you please. As Begbick and the men ponder Jimmy's philosophy, Fatty and Moses rush in with news: The hurricane has unexpectedly struck Pensacola, destroying Begbick’s enemies, the federal agents. Begbick and her cohorts take it as a sign that <b>Jimmy</b> <b>is</b> right; they join him, Jenny, and his three friends in singing a new, defiant song: If someone walks on, then it's me, and if someone gets walked on, then it's you. In the background, the men continue to chant their hymn as the hurricane draws nearer.|$|E

25|$|Jimmy {{travels to}} Apokolips {{and decides to}} confront Darkseid to {{determine}} his involvement with {{what is going on}} with his manifesting powers. Solomon tells him that he had been turned into a spirit collector by Darkseid, who plans to drain him of all his powers when the time comes. He is then sent back to Earth along with everyone else. <b>Jimmy</b> <b>is</b> later captured by Mary Marvel who intends to deliver him to Darkseid. Darkseid turns Jimmy's powers off and prepares to absorb them, but is attacked by Superman. As they battle, Mary Marvel fights and defeats Donna, Kyle, Forager, Black Canary, and Vixen. Darkseid reactivates Jimmy's power to cause him to emit kryptonite radiation to kill Superman. However, Ray Palmer sneaks inside Jimmy and destroys the circuitry that controls his powers before being overcome by its defenses. Jimmy transforms into a scaled giant and prepares to fight Darkseid. Darkseid fights Jimmy across Metropolis and is about to kill him when Ray Palmer emerges from Jimmy's head, having shut down the device inside Jimmy that was storing the essences of the New Gods. A Boom Tube then opens up and Orion, Darkseid's son, emerges. Orion clashes with Darkseid and kills him after ripping Darkseid's heart from his chest. Soon afterwards Jimmy returns home, where his relationship with Forager deteriorates.|$|E

The temptation of drugs, however, is too great; Jimmy forces Johnny to become {{increasingly}} erratic, and he eventually threatens Whatsername (and then himself) with a knife ("Know Your Enemy"). Whatsername attempts to talk about Johnny's behavior, while the Extraordinary Girl dresses Tunny's wounds and Will sits on the couch, once again alone ("21 Guns"). Johnny leaves a note for Whatsername, saying he has chosen Jimmy and drugs over her. Frightened and fed up, Whatsername tells Johnny that he is not the [...] "Jesus of Suburbia" [...] and reveals that St. <b>Jimmy</b> <b>is</b> nothing more than [...] "a figment of [...] father's rage and [...] mother's love" [...] ("Letterbomb"). She leaves him.|$|E

500|$|<b>Jimmy</b> <b>is</b> {{based on}} one of his cousins, who was rather {{feminine}} and {{spent most of his time}} playing with girls rather than with boys. Jonny and Plank are inspired by one of Antonucci's childhood friends, a loner who spent most of his time outside with his blanket. He stated that he believed it was important to add Plank, a board of wood, to the show, and that he [...] "thought it would be really cool to do the show with Plank taking on a character of his own" [...] and to cause Jonny to do things he would usually never do. Some wanted Plank to be able to talk, smile and blink as if he was alive, but Antonucci insisted that it should be treated as a piece of wood, brought to life by Jonny's imagination.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "The Rapture", Castiel enters Dean's {{dreams and}} {{arranges}} {{a meeting to}} tell him something important. However, when Sam and Dean go to meet him, they instead find Jimmy, Castiel's vessel, {{who claims to have}} little memory of his life as a vessel. Anna theorizes Castiel must have angered his superiors, prompting him to be taken back to Heaven. When <b>Jimmy</b> <b>is</b> shot {{at the end of the}} episode trying to save his family from demons, Castiel returns, taking Jimmy's daughter as his new vessel. After the demons are killed, a dying Jimmy begs Castiel to take him back as a host so his daughter will not have to go through what he did, and the angel acquiesces. Dean then asks him what he needed to tell him, but Castiel coldly replies his loyalty is to Heaven, not to mankind or to him.|$|E
500|$|American Idiot is {{a concept}} album that {{describes}} {{the story of a}} central character named Jesus of Suburbia, an anti-hero created by Billie Joe Armstrong. It is written {{from the perspective of a}} lower-middle-class suburban American teen, raised on a diet of [...] "soda pop and Ritalin." [...] Jesus of Suburbia hates his town and those close to him, so he leaves for the city. The second character introduced in the story is St. Jimmy, a [...] "swaggering punk rock freedom fighter par excellence." [...] Whatsername, [...] "a 'Mother Revolution' figure," [...] is introduced as a nemesis of St. Jimmy in the song [...] "She's a Rebel". The album's story is largely indeterminate, as the group was unsure of where to lead the plot's third quarter. In this sense, Armstrong decided to leave the ending up to the listeners' imagination. The two secondary characters exemplify the record's main theme—"rage versus love"—in that while St. <b>Jimmy</b> <b>is</b> driven by [...] "rebellion and self-destruction," [...] Whatsername is focused on [...] "following your beliefs and ethics." [...] Jesus of Suburbia eventually decides to follow the latter, resulting in the figurative suicide of St. Jimmy, which is revealed to be a facet of his personality. In the album's final song, Jesus of Suburbia loses his connection with Whatsername as well, to the point in which he can't even remember her name.|$|E
