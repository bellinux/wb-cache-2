40|$|Hayden White {{was born}} in Martin, Tennessee in 1928. During the Depression he moved {{with his family to}} Detroit in search of work, where his father became a union {{organizer}} in the automotive world. This urban scene of workers’ struggles to organize in the face of sometimes-violent corporate opposition was a watershed moment in informing White’s political consciousness. After a stint in the military, he used the GI Bill to go to Wayne State University. White went on to graduate school at the University of Michigan. Dr. White spent a full twenty-three years teaching at other institutions before 1978, when he found a fertile space for his interdisciplinary conception of scholarly work as the chair of the University of California Santa Cruz’s History of Consciousness program. In this oral history, White relates that history of consciousness gradually came to occupy a shifting territory that ranged from deep in the artistic side of the humanities well into the social sciences, and served as a haven for people interested in studying unconventional or cutting edge topics that weren’t at home in disciplinary graduate programs. The program actively recruited both gay students and students of color, seeking traditionally devalued perspectives, and ultimately, according to White, had a higher percentage of non-white students than any other humanities doctoral program anywhere. By late 80 s and early 90 s {{it was one of the}} most renowned humanities Ph. D. programs in the country, with an annual acceptance rate of five to six students for three to four hundred applicants. In a field where competing private schools and more well-funded public schools could offer big fellowships, histcon students had little to no fellowship money, but in spite of this <b>fiscal</b> <b>obstacle</b> the program built an international reputation, and had an unusually high rate of post-degree job placement for its students. In these interviews, White candidly charts the personalities and ideas and debates that gave shape and direction to this flagship humanities program, including those perspectives that changed the program—and him personally—in ways he hadn’t anticipated, like feminist studies and cultural studies. In these sessions White discusses not just histcon and UCSC, but illuminates their broader contexts, discussing at length the fiscally slashed state of the humanities, the changing academic scene and wider geopolitical issues. More personally, he reflects on his philosophies on teaching, which he terms “a nobler designation,” and discusses his own writing and the historiographical subject matter that has inspired so much of his work. These interviews provide a vehicle for White to track the relationship of metahistory (the subject of his landmark book of thesame name) to history, and explain his conception of moral relativism and different means of interacting with the past. ...|$|E

40|$|Within the European Union, {{there exists}} a {{fundamental}} tension between the fiscal sovereignty of its Member States, in particular {{in the field of}} direct taxation, and the requirements of the Internal Market, which aim at the abolition of any regulatory or <b>fiscal</b> <b>obstacles</b> to cross border movement of goods, persons, services and capital. While the impact of secondary European legislation and state aid control is still rather limited, the judicature of the European Court of Justice on the fundamental freedoms has established substantial constraints for national legislators which force Member States to provide equal treatment for purely domestic and cross-border situations. This has a major effect with respect to the taxation of corporate groups as the legislator is obliged to extend benefits for domestic groups to multinational enterprises. The article explains how this affects important elements of the international tax order like relief for intercompany dividends (credit or exemption), deductibility of expenditure related to foreign dividends, intra-group loss compensation, CFC legislation, thin capitalization and interest barriers/debt caps, transfer pricing and exit taxation...|$|R
50|$|In 2008, {{financial}} setbacks endangered the city's viability. The {{economic crisis}} severely affected tourism, which generates the most revenue, {{and that just}} {{at the time when}} the city had finalized a $18 million settlement over a property lawsuit. As the municipal budget was typically $14 million or less, city fathers had issued bonds with annual payments of approximately $1 million over 25 years. As a result of these combined <b>fiscal</b> <b>obstacles,</b> the threat of bankruptcy was very real. Dozens of meetings were held in order to decide where the budget should be cut and finally 75% of municipal employees were laid off and replaced with contract workers. Also, employee contributions toward retirement benefits were raised. However, the city council sought to regain the money paid in the settlement, believing that it should have been paid by the city's insurers. A lawsuit against the insurers was decided in 2013 and the insurer ordered to pay more than $13 million to the city; the costs of the lawsuit had been partially covered by the Association of Bay Area Governments.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} factors that {{influence}} the decision to apply R&D fiscal incentives in a sample of Spanish manufacturing firms. The observation that few innovative firms apply these incentives has motivated this analysis. We developed a model considering that behind the decision to use these fiscal incentives, firms carry out a cost-benefit evaluation. The data used come from the Encuesta sobre Estrategias Empresariales (ESEE) provided by the Ministry of Industry. The results show that firms evaluate positively the benefits from fiscal incentives, although there are some difficulties in applying them. The lack of information, the lack of some resources and the absence of results related to innovation activities are obstacles that may justify the scarce application of the tax incentives for R&D by the Spanish manufacturing firms.

40|$|The recent {{political}} {{developments in the}} Middle East have prompted increased scrutiny of the economies of the nations lying in this region. Over the past few months, the financial markets of Middle East and North Africa (MENA) {{have been affected by}} the speculations that existed before the war in Iraq as well as its subsequent repercussions. Factors such as lagging domestic, political reforms, government interference, and inflexible monetary and <b>fiscal</b> policies remain <b>obstacles</b> to privatization, globalization, and foreign investment in MENA economies. As the economies enter the post-war recovery phase, reform of financial markets seems necessary to accelerate economic growth.

5000|$|When the Grand Committee met on 11 October at {{the opening}} of the second phase, it was {{proposed}} by Sir Alexander McDowell that the [...] "Committee of Nine", composed of Redmond, Devlin, O'Donnell (Nationalists), Murphy, Russell (Independents), Barrie, Londonderry, McDowell (Ulster Unionists), and Midleton (Southern Unionists), should convene to negotiate, formulate and draft proposals for an agreed scheme for the government of Ireland. Also to discuss the Bishop's scheme, other sub-committees to deal with matters such as land purchase, police and electoral systems. Plunkett felt that Ulster Unionists were beginning to engage after the new sub-committee was formed to concentrate on the two major <b>obstacles,</b> <b>fiscal</b> policy and Ulster. McDowell was an expert negotiator and had the confidence of both the Ulster Unionist Council and was on good terms with Redmond. Unfortunately his sudden death ended his good work. But by the end of October, with the exception of fiscal powers, the sub-committee arrived at provisional agreement on nearly every vital point, with Redmond in the belief that a final agreement was in sight.|$|R

40|$|As far as {{the venture}} capital market is concerned, it is widely assumed that Europe lags way behind the United States. Recent papers have {{asserted}} that, in order to bridge this gap Europe should piggyback on US capital market institutions and their securities regulations. This paper critically examines these claims and suggests that European policymakers should focus on overcoming the institutional, legal, <b>fiscal,</b> and cultural <b>obstacles</b> that are understood to impose significant costs on start-up firms. A really underrated issue in the success formula of the US venture capital industry is the influence of legal forms {{on the quality of}} venture capital contracting. This paper analyzes the characteristics of European company structures, particularly the Dutch private company, and questions whether they are sufficiently flexible and responsive to solve the two-sided agency problems that characterize the relationship between the entrepreneur and the venture capitalists. This paper then argues that the introduction of an optimal organizational form for high-tech start-ups, based on US experiences, is crucial to Europe's attempt to emulate the successful US venture capital market. It is suggested that policymakers, with the support of interest groups, should undertake the task of developing a new limited liability vehicle. Indeed, a new organizational form, which is characterized by clarity and simplicity, may make high profile venture capitalists more willing to invest in new enterprises. The prospects for the introduction of a new vehicle depend on the regulatory competition and emulation, which together may eventually culminate in overcoming path dependent barriers to the European venture capital market. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{business}} world tends {{to establish a}} set of uniform norms for international trade. It works on forms of contracting that produce local and international benefits for commercialization (products, goods, and services); this has been understood by commerce and the law. Nonetheless, there are many <b>obstacles</b> (<b>fiscal,</b> taxes, legal protection of some contractual practices, and limiting clauses, among others) and it is sought for these to disappear, especially those that imply exaggerated protection of national commerce. The States seek mechanisms that help them regulate their relations among the different players and treaties are the main source from which emerge mandates that affect national and world economies, facilitating the creation of companies to explore new market places. It is thus that in the trade treaties or agreements, the objective is for trade to flow freely and for the nations to benefit from commercial exchange. In the private laws of the different nations, there are legal institutions that due to their national protection hinder their application at the international level, {{as is the case}} of the commercial agency, a controversial contract since its beginnings, recognizing that it has been an alternative for doing business in Colombia. This article critically analyzes the legal framework of the contract of commercial agency versus the integrationist objectives in free trade agreement (FTA) negotiations that tend to seek flexibility in this contractual form, according to the conditions imposed by the United States of modifying some contract benefits in the Colombian legislation. The aforementioned leads to ponder if with the modifications the Colombian State agreed to, {{within the framework of the}} Free Trade Agreement negotiations, the figure of this contract will continue being attractive, as a way of creating commercial representation companies in Colombi...|$|R
40|$|Product of {{workshop}} No. 5 at the 10 th MRM 2009 Monetary {{policy in the}} Middle East and North African (MENA) countries remains an understudied area; this book fills an important gap by examining monetary policy frameworks and monetary policy strategies in the region. Building on the editors’ earlier book, Monetary Policy and Central Banking in the Middle East and North Africa, which focused on central bank independence issues and on exchange rate regimes, this book emphasises monetary policy strategies. Part I contains {{an overview of the}} financial markets and institutions which condition the choice of monetary policy strategy in the countries of the region, followed by single-country studies on aspects of the monetary policy frameworks of Lebanon, Egypt, Jordan, the Palestinian Territory and Turkey. Part II includes analyses of the prospects for inflation targeting in Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia, of the monetary transmission mechanism in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, of the relative advantages of inflation targeting and exchange rate fixity with reference to Egypt, of the problem of fiscal dominance in Egypt, and of the inflationary implications of exchange rate fixity for Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The contributors are experts from universities inside and outside the MENA region, from central banks in the region and from outside institutions such as the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
