40|$|AbstractThe {{high heat}} flux {{areas on the}} {{vertical}} divertor targets in the ITER tokamak will consist of cuboid tungsten monoblocks bonded to copper cooling tubes. Three-dimensional ion orbit modelling {{is used to calculate}} the heating of tungsten monoblocks during ELMs at the inner vertical target, where the highest surface energy densities are expected. The presence of thin gaps between monoblocks results in exposed edges onto which the heat flux can be focused. ELM ions are focused by their gyromotion onto the magnetically shadowed, long toroidal edges of the monoblocks. The risk of monoblock <b>edge</b> <b>melting</b> is greater than the risk of full surface melting on the plasma-wetted zone. Alternative shaping solutions such as edge chamfering, filleting, and poloidal beveling do not show promise; the melt zone simply migrates to other locations on the monoblocks. Without ELM mitigation, there is a marginal risk of <b>edge</b> <b>melting</b> due to uncontrolled ELMs in the pre-nuclear phase of ITER operation, and an absolute certainty of it in the burning nuclear phase. To avoid <b>edge</b> <b>melting</b> altogether, the surface energy density would have to limited to less than 0. 15 MJ/m 2...|$|E

40|$|Ice-ocean heat {{exchange}} in polar leads was examined using a large-eddy simulation model coupled to a slab ice model. Simulations were performed using an idealized square domain {{for a range}} of lead sizes, surface wind stress (0. 05 – 0. 1 N/m²), and lead temperature/salinity profiles. Particular emphasis was placed on understanding the role of fresh water in leads and how stratification controls the heat budget and ice <b>edge</b> <b>melting</b> rate. With uniform initial conditions we found that solar heating was not strong enough to develop lead freshening via ice edge melting; even weak winds (0. 02 N/m²) generated circulations that maintained a well-mixed lead. In the weak wind case, adding a fresh water flux representative of surface melt runoff provided enough additional stratification so that the lead water became isolated {{from the rest of the}} simulated ocean boundary layer. However, stronger winds (0. 1 N/m²) prevented the fresh water layer from forming. Experiments initialized with temperature/salinity profiles similar to observed cases (fresh water layer capping the lead) demonstrated that lateral melting rates increase with expanding lead size, agreeing with simple heat balance calculations for a square lead without vertical mixing. However, with stronger winds, lateral melting rates decreased because of greater turbulent mixing of cold water from beneath the fresh layer. Inspection of the lead circulation indicated that the strongest melting occurred where the ice edge currents were the largest. Overall, melting fluxes for a 24 m² lead ranged from 200 to 400 W m², depending on the wind speed. Without the fresh layer, fluxes ranged from 50 to 60 W m², suggesting that fresh water stratification can have a dominate role in controlling ice <b>edge</b> <b>melting...</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{results of}} laser {{scribing}} experiments of CIGS thin films deposited on Mo-coated stainless steel sheets, using laser pulses with a wavelength of 1550 nm and a pulse duration of 6 ns, {{are presented in}} this study. It is shown that a removal of the CIGS from the Mo film is possible without <b>edge</b> <b>melting</b> of the CIGS or damaging of the Mo. The critical parameter for inducing the delamination lift-off process of the CIGS from the Mo was identified to be the scribing speed of the laser. In dependence on the laser parameters two different material removal processes were found. For a low pulse overlap the laser pulse penetrates the CIGS film and is absorbed in the interface between the CIGS and the Mo causing a lift-off process of the CIGS from the Mo back contact. For a high pulse overlap an ablation process starting from the top side of the CIGS film was found. The composition and morphology of the sample material after the laser patterning were analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and micro-Raman spectroscopy...|$|E

40|$|Cracking {{thresholds}} {{and crack}} patterns in tungsten targets after repetitive ITER-like edge localized mode (ELM) pulses {{have been studied}} in recent simulation experiments by laser irradiation. The tungsten specimens were tested under selected conditions to quantify the thermal shock response. A Nd:YAG laser capable of delivering up to 32 J of energy per pulse {{with a duration of}} 1 ms at the fundamental wavelength λ = 1064 nm has been used to irradiate ITER-grade tungsten samples with repetitive heat loads. The laser exposures were performed for targets at room temperature (RT) as well as for targets preheated to 400 °C to measure the effects of the ELM-like loading conditions on the formation and development of cracks. The magnitude of the heat loads was 0. 19, 0. 38, 0. 76 and 0. 90 MJ m− 2 (below the melting threshold) with a pulse duration of 1 ms. The tungsten surface was analysed after 100 and 1000 laser pulses to investigate the influence of material modification by plasma exposures on the cracking threshold. The observed damage threshold for ITER-grade W lies between 0. 38 and 0. 76 GW m− 2. Continued cycling up to 1000 pulses at RT results in enhanced erosion of crack edges and crack <b>edge</b> <b>melting.</b> At the base temperature of 400 °C, the formation of cracks is suppressed...|$|E
40|$|The key {{remaining}} physics design {{issue for}} the ITER tungsten (W) divertor {{is the question of}} monoblock (MB) front surface shaping in the high heat flux target areas of the actively cooled targets. Engineering tolerance specifications impose a challenging maximum radial step between toroidally adjacent MBs of 0. 3 mm. Assuming optical projection of the parallel heat loads, magnetic shadowing of these edges is required if quasi-steady state melting is to be avoided under certain conditions during burning plasma operation and transiently during edge localized mode (ELM) or disruption induced power loading. An experiment on JET in 2013 designed to investigate the consequences of transient W <b>edge</b> <b>melting</b> on ITER, found significant deficits in the edge power loads expected on the basis of simple geometric arguments, throwing doubt on the understanding of edge loading at glancing field line angles. As a result, a coordinated multi-experiment and simulation effort was initiated via the International Tokamak Physics Activity (ITPA) and through ITER contracts, aimed at improving the physics basis supporting a MB shaping decision {{from the point of view}} both of edge power loading and melt dynamics. This paper reports on the outcome of this activity, concluding first that the geometrical approximation for leading edge power loading on radially misaligned poloidal leading edges is indeed valid. On this basis, the behaviour of shaped and unshaped monoblock surfaces under stationary and transient loads, with and without melting, is compared in order to examine the consequences of melting, or power overload in context of the benefit, or not, of shaping. The paper concludes that MB top surface shaping is recommended to shadow poloidal gap edges in the high heat flux areas of the ITER divertor targets...|$|E
