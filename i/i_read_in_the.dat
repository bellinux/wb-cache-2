Later, when asked by the press about Watergate, she replied curtly, [...] "I know only what <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> newspapers." [...] In 1974, when a reporter asked [...] "Is the press {{the cause of the}} president's problems?", she shot back, [...] "What problems?" [...] Privately, she felt that the power of her husband's staff was increasing, and President Nixon was becoming more removed from what was occurring in the administration.|$|E

Guest actor Kevin Corrigan returned as recurring character Sam Weiss. The episode featured guest stars Jody Thompson and Paul Jarrett as the new characters Sara Downey and Warren Blake, respectively. Thompson called the part [...] "the kind of role that actors dream of". She described the episode, [...] "The material was so compelling and perfectly written {{it was a matter}} of not getting in the way of what the creators had created. I’m anxious about how it will come off. Truthfully, I’ve been torturing myself, wondering if I have somehow ruined the beauty of what <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> script".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1915, Rogers {{began to appear in}} Florenz Ziegfeld's Midnight Frolic. The variety revue began at midnight in the top-floor night club of Ziegfeld's New Amsterdam Theatre, and drew many influential—and regular—customers. By this time, Rogers had refined his act. His monologues on {{the news of the day}} {{followed}} a similar routine every night. He appeared on stage in his cowboy outfit, nonchalantly twirling his lasso, and said, [...] "Well, what shall I talk about? I ain't got anything funny to say. All I know is what <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> papers." [...] He would make jokes about what he had read in that day's newspapers. The line [...] "All I know is what <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> papers" [...] is often incorrectly described as Rogers's most famous punch line, when it was his opening line.|$|E

2500|$|As {{part of his}} {{analysis}} of the [...] "crowd", Kierkegaard accused newspapers of decay and decadence. Kierkegaard stated Christendom had [...] "lost its way" [...] by recognizing [...] "the crowd", as the many who are moved by newspaper stories, as the court of last resort in relation to [...] "the truth". Truth comes to a single individual, not all people at one and the same time. Just as truth comes to one individual at a time so does love. One doesn't love the crowd but does love their neighbor, who is a single individual. He says, [...] "never have <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Holy Scriptures this command: You shall love the crowd; even less: You shall, ethico-religiously, recognize in the crowd the court of last resort in relation to 'the truth.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Therefore, I beseeched the Lord {{to teach}} me His statutes. After my prayer as usual I opened my Bible with closed eyes and {{put my finger on}} the right place. For the first time I opened Revelation 1:3"Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand." [...] I asked the Lord: [...] "O Lord! What about until then?" [...] And again I opened the Bible, that time on 1 Timothy 1:15"This is a {{faithful}} saying, and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief." [...] And for the third time I tempted the Lord, saying: [...] "O Lord! I am not an Abraham nor a Jew, I'm a sinner, but involve me to understand Your Will." [...] And then I opened the Book of SirahJoshua 24:29-30, where <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new American Translation: [...] "Said to myself, I will water my plants, my flower bed I will drench; and suddenly this rivulet of mine became a river, then this stream of mine, a sea. Thus do I send my teaching forth shining like a dawn, to become known afar off. Thus do I pour out instruction like prophecy and bestow it on generations to come." ...|$|E
2500|$|Over {{one million}} Armenians {{died in the}} Armenian Genocide, which took place between the years of 1915 and 1917. Lemkin's {{interest}} in prosecuting the perpetrators was sparked when he first learned about the genocide during his studies at University of Lwów (from which he graduated in 1926). In his autobiography, Lemkin wrote {{that he had been}} influenced by the March 15, 1921 assassination of Talaat Pasha: “Then one day <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> newspapers that all Turkish war criminals were to be released... The Turkish criminals released from Malta dispersed all over the world. The most frightful among them was Talaat Pasha, the minister of the interior of Turkey, who was identified with the destruction of the Armenian people... One day he was stopped in the street by a young Armenian with the name Tehlirian. After identifying Talaat Pasha, Tehlirian shot him saying, ‘This is for my mother.’” This event became a topic of discussion for Lemkin during his studies on the topic of sovereignty at Lwów: “Sovereignty… ‘cannot be conceived as the right to kill millions of people." [...] The murder of Talaat Pasha and trial of Tehlirian prompted Lemkin’s future path. Lemkin wrote: [...] "At that moment, my worries about the murder of the innocent became more meaningful to me. I didn't know all the answers but I felt that a law against this type of racial or religious murder must be adopted by the world.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Regarding {{the idea}} of gaining a day, Verne said of its origin: [...] "I have {{a great number of}} {{scientific}} odds and ends in my head. It was thus that, when, one day in a Paris café, <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Siècle that a man could travel around the world in 80 days, it immediately struck me that I could profit by a difference of meridian and make my traveller gain or lose a day in his journey. There was a dénouement ready found. The story was not written until long after. I carry ideas about in my head for years – ten, or 15 years, sometimes – before giving them form." [...] In his April 1873 lecture, [...] "The Meridians and the Calendar", Verne responded to a question about where the change of day actually occurred, since the international date line had only become current in 1880 and the Greenwich prime meridian was not adopted internationally until 1884. Verne cited an 1872 article in Nature, and Edgar Allan Poe's short story [...] "Three Sundays in a Week" [...] (1841), which was also based on going around the world and the difference in a day linked to a marriage at the end. Verne even analysed Poe's story in his Edgar Poe and His Works (1864). Poe's story [...] "Three Sundays in a Week" [...] was clearly the inspiration for the lost day plot device.|$|E
