25|$|Brody's Jerusalemic {{association}} {{is not a}} sheer modern invention. The tradition ascribes this analogy to the emperor Joseph II, who visited Brody in 1774 and presumably said that Now, it is clear why I am designated to be Jerusalem king (one of the titles of Austrian emperors). Joseph's stay in Brody resulted in significant consequences. In 1778 he issues the decree that makes Brody a free town. This event quickly reflected on city development and life, marking a new era that lasted for 100 favourable years in all the respects. Yet in 1774 Joseph II freed Brody citizens from all the taxes under the condition of reconstruction of old houses and erecting of new ones. The market square got surrounded by new stone houses with undergrounds <b>for</b> <b>storage</b> <b>purposes.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Major {{renovation}} of the third station took place in 1910, which included the installation of a [...] "huge electric sign" [...] placed {{at the corner of}} Franklin and Fayette streets. The company spent several hundred dollars in order to widen the Fayette Street entrance [...] and add concrete steps. Additionally, three [...] "good sized" [...] private offices were converted into a large waiting room with new maple floors, decorations, steel ceilings and comfortable seating. A hole was cut through the back partition for a ticket window and plate glass windows were installed in the main waiting room and an [...] "electric light sign" [...] was placed in the corner. A lavatory for women was added just off the waiting room and the room formerly used for a waiting room in the back corner was converted <b>for</b> <b>storage</b> <b>purposes.</b> The third depot was demolished in 1936.|$|E
2500|$|Unit {{construction}} {{since its}} introduction has defined {{the development of}} the modern kitchen. Pre-manufactured modules, using mass manufacturing techniques developed during World War II, greatly brought down the cost of a kitchen. Units which are kept on the floor are called [...] "floor units", [...] "floor cabinets", or [...] "base cabinets" [...] on which a kitchen worktop – originally often formica and often now made of granite, marble, tile or wood – is placed. The units which are held on the wall <b>for</b> <b>storage</b> <b>purposes</b> are termed as [...] "wall units" [...] or [...] "wall cabinets". In small areas of kitchen in an apartment, even a [...] "tall storage unit" [...] is available for effective storage. In cheaper brands, all cabinets are kept a uniform color, normally white, with interchangeable doors and accessories chosen by the customer to give a varied look. In more expensive brands, the cabinets are produced matching the doors' colors and finishes, for an older more bespoke look.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{being the}} most {{advanced}} icebreaker in the world, Voima still looked aesthetically pleasing with her low, gently rounded hull and superstructure. Many of her features, such as the open bridge with covered bridge wings, could {{be traced back to}} the pre-war steam-powered icebreakers. She had two continuous decks and a long forecastle that contained most of the cabins and social areas for the crew of 58. Although Voima was built with two small cargo holds <b>for</b> <b>storage</b> <b>purposes,</b> most of the space under the main deck is occupied by the engine and propulsion motor rooms, making the icebreaker literally [...] "a ship loaded with power". She also has eight heeling tanks that can be used to free the icebreaker from compressive pack ice. Like the steam-powered icebreakers built before the war, she was also fitted with deck gun mounts. During the refit, the old superstructure was completely removed and replaced with an angular deckhouse slightly resembling those of Sisu and Urho. The crew, now accommodated in individual cabins high in the superstructure away from the noises generated by the icebreaking process, was reduced to 44 due to advancing automation. Later the crew has been further reduced to 21.|$|E

40|$|It is well known, {{that the}} {{electrical}} energy storage {{in the large}} scale is basically a difficult process. Such a process is connected with energy losses, as most frequently it is the conversion of electrical energy into another form, for example mechanical, {{and then back to}} the primal electrical form. Though, the SMES technology offers the energy storage in an unchanged form, which is advantageous primarily in the achieved efficiency. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) devices, commonly used in the medical facilities are based on the basis of superconducting magnet. After its rejection from operation, (basically caused only by its „software fustiness“ and not by functional faults), there is a possibility of using such devices <b>for</b> the energy <b>storage</b> <b>purposes.</b> Additionally, such a technology of storage is also ecological.
