5|$|The freeway {{was built}} in phases with the <b>frontage</b> roads {{constructed}} first followed by the main lanes. The overpasses for Wiseman Boulevard, Westover Hills Boulevard and Military Drive between I-410 and Loop1604 were completed over the main lanes of SH151 in 1987. In 1988, the I-410 overpasses over the SH151 <b>frontage</b> roads were completed, as was the interchange with US90 at the eastern terminus. Also completed in 1988 were the <b>frontage</b> road bridges over Leon and Slick Ranch Creek, which enabled traffic to travel the entire corridor from Loop1604 to US90 {{by way of the}} <b>frontage</b> roads. The main lane overpasses at FM1957 (Potranco Road) and Ingram Road were completed in 1997. The overpasses at Pinn Road and Enrique M. Barrera Parkway were completed in 1998, and completed at Callaghan Road in 2000. Construction of the freeway was completed in 2004.|$|E

Just shy of Mojave the freeway portion of Route14 ends, while the <b>frontage</b> road becomes a dirt path and eventually terminates. From this point, the canonical route of Sierra Highway joins State Route 14, passing through downtown Mojave.|$|E

5|$|A short {{distance}} past the city line, NY5 passes over the Union Ship Canal on {{a span of}} the elevated road known as the Father Baker Bridge. North of the waterway, the Skyway gains a <b>frontage</b> road named Fuhrmann Boulevard.

5|$|BL-80 {{continues}} {{to the east}} past Aria Boulevard, which to the north connects to I-80, and to the south leads to the historic Wendover Air Force Base, where the 509th Composite Group was stationed while it prepared to conduct atomic bomb attacks against Japan during 1944 and 1945. The highway briefly parallels the Shafter Subdivision of the Union Pacific Railroad's Central Corridor, which was formerly part of the Feather River Route of the Western Pacific Railroad. As the highway travels east towards a half trumpet interchange with I-80, the number of lanes drops from five to two. Traffic from BL-80 can access eastbound I-80 or turn off onto <b>Frontage</b> Road; however, to access westbound I-80, travelers must continue eastbound until the next exit and turn around.

5|$|Route 124 {{crosses the}} Passaic River and {{runs along the}} border of Millburn, Essex County {{to the north and}} Summit, Union County, coming to a large {{interchange}} with the Route 24 freeway and CR649 (John F. Kennedy Parkway). Here, the route becomes a <b>frontage</b> road for the Route 24 freeway that has two lanes in each direction. The road passes to the south of The Mall at Short Hills before running through the Canoe Brook Country Club. It heads southeast into wooded residential neighborhoods and intersects Union CR657, where the Route 124 <b>frontage</b> road has ramps to Route 24. A short distance later, the route passes an overpass to nowhere that crosses over Route 24 at Brantwood Drive which was closed and walled off. The Route 124 <b>frontage</b> road has since eliminated the intersection at Brantwood Drive. In 2013, City of Summit vacated the 50-foot public right of way of the old road section from Route 124 into the current Brantwood Drive. In a short distance, Route 124 intersects Essex CR608, at which point the route has an eastbound ramp to eastbound Route 24 and a westbound ramp from westbound Route 24. Past this intersection, the Route 124 <b>frontage</b> road along Route 24 ends and the route becomes a two-lane undivided road called South Service Road that closely parallels the north side of Route 24, passing under the Morristown Line. The route heads past businesses and forms the border of Millburn to the north and Springfield Township, Union County to the south, coming to an intersection with CR512 near an interchange with Route 24. There is a direct ramp from westbound Route 124 to Route 24 a short distance to the northwest of this intersection.|$|E
