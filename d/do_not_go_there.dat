50|$|In 1959 the International Labour Organisation (ILO) {{published}} a report stating {{that between the}} period of 1951-1956, a number of 650,000 Muslims from India relocated to West Pakistan. However, Visaria (1969) raised doubts about {{the authenticity of the}} claims about Indian Muslim migration to Pakistan, since the 1961 Census of Pakistan did not corroborate these figures. However, the 1961 Census of Pakistan did incorporate a statement suggesting {{that there had been a}} migration of 800,000 people from India to Pakistan throughout the previous decade. Of those who had left for Pakistan, most never came back. The Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru conveyed distress about the continued migration of Indian Muslims to West Pakistan:There has...since 1950 been a movement of some Muslims from India to Western Pakistan through the Jodhpur-Sindh via Khokhropar. Normallly, traffic between India and West Pakistan was controlled by the permit system. But these Muslims going via Khokhropar went without permits to West Pakistan. From January 1952 to the end of September, 53,209 Muslim emigrants went via Khokhropar....Most of these probably came from the U.P. In October 1952, up to the 14th, 6,808 went by this route. After that Pakistan became much stricter on allowing entry on the introduction of the passport system. From the 15th of October to the end of October, 1,247 went by this route. From the 1st November, 1,203 went via Khokhropar.Indian Muslim migration to West Pakistan continued unabated despite the cessation of the permit system between the two countries and the introduction of the passport system between the two countries. The Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru once again expressed concern at the continued migration of Indian Muslims to West Pakistan in a communication to one of his chief ministers (dated 1, December 1953):A fair number of Muslims cross over to Pakistan from India, via Rajasthan and Sindh daily. Why do these Muslims cross over to Pakistan at the rate of three to four thousand a month? This is worth enquiring into, because it is not to our credit that this should be so. Mostly they come from Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan or Delhi. It is evident that they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>there</b> unless there is some fear or pressure on them. Some may go in the hope of employment there. But most of them appear to feel that there is no great future for them in India. I have already drawn your attention to difficulties in the way of Government service. Another reason, I think, is the fear of Evacuee Property Laws EPL. I have always considered these laws both in India and Pakistan as most iniquitous. In trying to punish a few guilty persons, we punish or injure large numbers of perfectly innocent people...the pressure of the Evacuee Property Laws applies to almost all Muslims in certain areas of India. They cannot easily dispose of their property or carry on trade for fear that the long arm of this law might hold them down in its grip. It is this continuing fear that comes in the way of normal functioning and normal business and exercises a powerful pressure on large numbers of Muslims in India, especially in the North and the West.In 1952 the passport system was introduced for travel purposes between the two countries. This made it possible for Indian Muslims to legally move to Pakistan. Pakistan still required educated and skill workers to absorb into its economy at the time, due to relatively low levels of education in the regions which became part of Pakistan. As late as December 1971, the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi was authorized to issue documents to educationally qualified Indians to migrate to Pakistan. The legal route was taken by unemployed but educated Indian Muslims seeking better fortunes, however poorer Muslims from India continued to go illegally via the Rajasthan-Sindh border until the 1965 India-Pakistan war when that route was shut. After the conclusion of the 1965 war, most Muslims who wanted to go to Pakistan had to go there via the India-East Pakistani border. Once reaching Dhaka, most made their way to the final destination-Karachi. However, not all managed to reach West Pakistan from East Pakistan.|$|E

30|$|There is {{a strong}} {{positive}} relationship between the spatiotemporal distribution of people and the potential number of casualties. The distribution of the people varies from daytime to nighttime among different occupancy classes and temporal scenarios in a year. The variation is particularly remarkable for commercial buildings. In residential buildings at least two persons are present during daytime while other residents go to schools, colleges, or work places. Each of the scenarios shows a distinct population distribution throughout the year. The strike day and Ramadan day scenarios show a different distribution than the weekday scenario even if these scenarios cover the weekdays of the year. In a strike day, population distribution fluctuates more in educational institutions than in other occupancy classes. As a consequence more people are found in residential buildings during strikes. Distribution of people also decreases in mixed-use buildings, markets, banks, and other commercial buildings because people <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>there</b> during a strike except in an emergency. During Ramadan, the daytime population density increases mainly in the commercial buildings such as markets, shops (especially those dealing with clothing and fabrics), tailoring enterprises and so on). Ramadan decreases daytime customers in food shops, restaurants, and nonreligious recreational centers during daytime. The number of people also increases along the street in Ramadan due to the temporary markets that appear in the roadside footpath.

40|$|Although {{the risk}} of {{catching}} an infection {{as a result of}} a fish spa pedicure is likely to be very low, it cannot be completely excluded. However, there are certain things you can do to further reduce your risk of catching or spreading an infection when having one of these treatments. Choosing a salonUse your personal judgment: as with all beauty salons, if it looks unsanitary, <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>there</b> for your treatment. If you are very concerned about the cleanliness of a salon you visit, you can report this to your local Environmental Health department, who will be able to perform an inspection of the premises. When having a treatment, a trained member of staff should perform an inspection of your feet both beforehand, to check for any broken skin / infections, and afterwards, to check for signs of bleeding. They should also ask you to wash your feet with soap and water before putting them in the tank, to make sure that any products you have used that could be harmful to the fish are washed away, and to reduce {{the risk of}} spreading any infection. Ask your therapist what other procedures the salon has in place to minimise the risk of infection. The Health Protection Agency, England has produced a set of guidelines for salons which, if followed, will ensure any potential risk of infection is kept to an absolute minimum. Before having the treatment The HPA has identified a number of health conditions or prior treatments which may mean that you should not have a fish pedicure. These are:Leg waxing or shaving in last 24 hoursAny open cuts/wounds/abrasions/broken skin on the feet or lower legsInfection on the feet (including athlete 2 ̆ 7 s foot, verruca) Psoriasis, eczema or dermatitis affecting the feet or lower legsDiabetes (increased risk of infection) Infection with a blood borne virus such as Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C or HIVAny immune deficiency due to illness or medicationBleeding disorders or on anticoagulant medication (e. g. heparin or warfarinMore information and advice on fish spa pedicures and the full set of guidance can be found on the Health Protection website www. hpa. org. u...|$|E
40|$|Protecting hives against {{predators and}} thieves Cue: In any farming {{business}} there is risk. Crops {{may be at}} risk, for example, from drought, disease, pests or thieves. And for beekeepers, their bees, hives and honey are also at risk from several dangers. Termites, for example, can cause serious damage to hives, other insects such as red ants can attack bees, and some larger animals ? not to mention humans - may break the hives and steal the honey. Methods for protecting bees and hives will vary for different types of hive. For example, for hives that stand on the ground, putting {{the legs of the}} hive in containers filled with water can help to keep them free of termites. In Malawi, however, most beekeepers use traditional hives, which are hung in trees. Alex Banda, a Malawian bee expert, spoke to Excello Zidana about these traditional beehives can be protected against predators, including thieves. IN:		?In beekeeping {{we have a number of}} enemies ? OUT:		?to have a free hand on that. ? DUR?N:	 6 ? 19 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Alex Banda, a beekeeping expert from Malawi, was talking to Excello Zidana. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Banda	In beekeeping we have a number of enemies that can cause damage to either the hives themselves or the bees. For example, we have an animal which is known as a honey badger. This animal, which looks like a cat but is short and stout, black and white, this one can cause great damage to bee hives as well as the honey and the brood inside. We also have red ants. These, they cause damage to bees, they kill the bees actually if they go into the hive. Zidana	How do you protect the beekeeping itself from these animals and insects you have mentioned so far? Banda	Initially, the beekeeper has to look for a nice place where he can place his hives in the forest. Enemies like red ants, those are found in damp areas, so a beekeeper has to avoid such areas. And the way a hive is placed in the field, it has to be installed in such a way that it is away from trees. For example, the beekeeper selects a place where there are two poles or two free standing trees which should be five or four metres apart, and then the hive would be hung in between these two trees. Zidana		Using what? Banda	Using wire. From the ground to the bottom of the hive it has to be 1. 2 metres. Zidana		Not less than that? Banda	Not less than that, because the honey badger is 90 cm when it stands on its feet. Now should it be less than a metre it means when it stands on its feet it will be able to catch the hive and damage it, but if it is above that it will be unable to do that. Now because you have hung the hive in between the two trees it can also climb the tree and slide to the hive. Now we have what we call a honey badger protector which has to be put on top of the hive. Zidana		How does this thing look like? Banda	The honey badger protector is made of sticks. Three long ones and 12 up to 15 small ones, which will run across. And then you nail these together using 3 inch nails so that it is strong enough. When you put it on top there, it should be bigger than the cover so that when the honey badger goes on top there, it will just be dancing there without damaging the hive. But without the honey badger protector, even if you have hung the hive between the two trees it will still attack it. Zidana	You talked about red ants. How does this protect against red ants, the positioning? Banda	Firstly, the trees where the hive has been hung must be in a place which has been cleared. You clear the grass around the trees so that the ground is free of grass. On top of that, you add ashes to the base of the trees. Red ants do not like ashes, so they cannot climb the trees. In addition to the ashes at the base of the two trees, you also smear grease to the wires which you have used to hang the hive to the trees. You put about 5 cm length for the grease. Now when the ants come to the grease they will not go over that, but it has to be renewed now and then, because with time it gets dry. Once it gets dry it means the first ant that will go there will get caught and then the next will get caught, in the long run they will make a bridge which will allow the ants to be passing through even if you have put that grease. But once you renew it now and then, it deters ants to go the beehive. Zidana		Now how about monkeys, we are told that monkeys are good honey hunters? Banda	Monkeys, they are not bees? enemies actually. They just go to the hive because they look at the hive as something which they can play with. So they just go there, play, they just disturb the bees. Because when they are on top of the hive and the hive is swinging, it means inside there the combs which are warm can get broken. That is the only disadvantage. Zidana	Now we have thieves, they would like to go and get maybe honey and have some money out of nothing. How do farmers protect bee hives from thieves? Banda	Vandalism by man is a very tricky thing because you are dealing with somebody who is thinking. So the first thing what has to be done is for the beekeeper to be friendly with the communities around. He has to explain to the communities what he is doing there and even tell them that they are welcome to learn his art of what he is doing. And then if somebody has stolen the honey, the local leaders can call a meeting and talk about that thing. Also when introducing the beekeeping in an area, it is good that people are made aware, people are sensitised that they are also free to go and participate in the activity. Finally, the beekeeper himself must make his presence known in the area where he has got his beehives. He must be seen to be going there frequently, so that people know that the apiary belongs to Mr Phiri, Mr Banda, and in that way thieving will not be taking place. Because normally what happens is people just install beehives and they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>go</b> <b>there,</b> they do not do inspections and people think it does not belong to anybody, so they are free to have a free hand on that. End of track. How to make traditional beehives safe from predators such as honey badgers and red ants, and from thieves...|$|E
