5000|$|A <b>fork</b> <b>end,</b> [...] fork-end, or forkend is a slot in {{a bicycle}} frame or bicycle fork where the axle of a bicycle wheel is attached. A dropout {{is a type}} of <b>fork</b> <b>end</b> that allows the rear wheel to be removed without first derailing the chain.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{rear track}} fork ends have {{threaded}} devices ("chaintugs") {{to aid in}} setting the proper chain tension. These may be integral to the <b>fork</b> <b>end</b> or separate items. They work by holding the rear axle in an eye {{at the end of}} a threaded bolt. The bolt passes through a cap which fits over the open <b>fork</b> <b>end.</b> Tightening the bolts on each side causes the axle to be pulled backwards towards the open <b>fork</b> <b>end,</b> tensing the chain. Chaintugs can also solve the problem of [...] "axle creep" [...] on hard-ridden fixed-gear bicycles, especially those with hard chromed fork ends, which may not offer adequate grip for the serrated track nuts.|$|E
25|$|The rear {{triangle}} {{connects to}} the rear <b>fork</b> <b>ends,</b> where the rear wheel is attached. It consists of the seat tube and paired chain stays and seat stays. The chain stays run connecting the bottom bracket to the rear <b>fork</b> <b>ends.</b> The seat stays connect {{the top of the}} seat tube (often at or near the same point as the top tube) to the rear <b>fork</b> <b>ends.</b>|$|R
50|$|Track bicycle frames have track <b>fork</b> <b>ends,</b> {{on which}} the opening faces rearwards. Because {{they do not have}} dropouts, the chain must be derailed from the {{sprocket}} before the rear wheel can be removed from a typical track bike. Some single-speed bicycles intended for street or trail use are also equipped with track <b>fork</b> <b>ends</b> instead of dropouts.|$|R
60|$|The real {{object of}} these {{preliminary}} feats, however performed, is, probably, to inspire faith, which Dr. Charcot {{might have done}} by swallowing a cradle. The Indians explain that the barrel staves apparently swallowed are merely dematerialised by 'spirits,' leaving only the <b>forked</b> <b>end</b> {{sticking out of the}} conjurer's mouth. In fact, Hearne caught the conjurer in the act of making a separate <b>forked</b> <b>end.</b>|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the dangers}} {{inherent}} in slingshots is the high probability that the bands will fail. Most bands are made from latex, which degrades with time and use, causing the bands to eventually fail under load. [...] Failures at the pouch end are safest, as they result in the band rebounding away from the user. Failures at the <b>fork</b> <b>end,</b> however, send the band back towards the shooter's face, which can cause eye and facial injuries. [...] One method to minimize {{the chance of a}} <b>fork</b> <b>end</b> failure is to utilize a tapered band, thinner at the pouch end, and thicker and stronger at the <b>fork</b> <b>end.</b> [...] Designs that use loose parts at the fork are the most dangerous, as they can result in those parts being propelled back towards the shooter's face, such as the ball attachment used in the recalled Daisy [...] "Natural" [...] line of slingshots (see image). The band could slip out of the slot in which it rested, and the hard ball in the tube resulted in cases of blindness and broken teeth. Daisy models using plain tubular bands were not covered in the recall, because the elastic tubing does not cause severe injuries upon failure.|$|E
50|$|Some manufacturers, such as Cannondale and Strida, offer a fork with {{a single}} leg. Many of Cannondale's single bladed forks, called Lefty, are {{suspension}} forks, in either conventional or inverted configurations. These forks use linear needle roller bearings on octagonal races to transmit the steering torque to the wheel, while conventional two bladed suspension forks use tubular linear plain bearings. Use of a Lefty fork requires a special Lefty hub, which attaches to the <b>fork</b> <b>end</b> {{by means of a}} screw that presses the hub onto the axle that is fixed to the fork.|$|E
50|$|For the Rinne test, a {{vibrating}} {{tuning fork}} (typically 512 Hz) is placed initially on the mastoid process behind each ear until sound {{is no longer}} heard. The fork is then immediately placed just outside the ear with the patient asked to report when the sound caused by the vibration is no longer heard. A normal or positive Rinne test is when the sound heard outside the ear (air conduction or AC) is louder than the initial sound heard when the tuning <b>fork</b> <b>end</b> is placed against the skin {{on top of the}} mastoid process behind the ear (bone conduction or BC). Therefore, AC > BC; which is how it is reported clinically for a normal or positive Rinne result. In conductive hearing loss, bone conduction is better than air or BC > AC, a negative Rinne.|$|E

5000|$|Based on {{the earlier}} Kelly tool, the Halligan is a {{multipurpose}} tool for prying, twisting, punching, or striking. It {{consists of a}} claw (or fork), a blade (wedge or adze), and a tapered pick, which is especially useful in quickly breaching many types of locked doors. Either the adze end or <b>fork</b> <b>end</b> of the tool {{can be used to}} break through the latch of a swinging door by forcing the tool between the door and doorjamb and prying the two apart, striking it with a sledgehammer or a flat-head axe. The firefighter holding the Halligan can use a [...] "baseball bat swing" [...] to sink the pick into the door frame near the door handle and then force the door by applying pressure to the adze. Another option is to use the Halligan to pry the door off the top hinges. The pick and adze, only when properly used provide protectionto the arms, hands, and body of the holder during forcible entry operation. The Halligan can be used to knock down a wall in a house to get to another area. The halligan {{can be used to make}} a purchase point on a car hood to cut the battery. The point can be used to break glass on a car or building for access or ventilationThe pick can be placed into the shackle (or eye) of a padlock or hasp and twisted or pried to break it free. It can also be driven into a roof to provide a foothold for firefighters engaged in vertical ventilation. Using a K-tool and the adze end, a lock cylinder can easily be pulled. The <b>fork</b> <b>end</b> is routinely used to shut off gas meter valves. The Halligan can also be used for vehicle extrication among other things. The tool can be used to pry open the hood of a car when it is jammed from an accident. The Halligan can be used as a step to get up on a window that is at head level. The Halligan can be tied to a rope and act as an anchor in the window frame, for improvised bailout.|$|E
5000|$|A {{correctly}} secured {{quick release}} {{is unlikely to}} be ejected from the <b>fork</b> <b>end</b> in normal use where rim brakes are in use, although recently there has been some evidence, notably from James Annan, a British scientist working in Japan, suggesting that the moments in disc brake systems can cause quick-release front wheels to be ejected past the lawyer tabs. A small number of serious crashes have been attributed to this cause. This is controversial, and the fork manufacturers have not admitted a fault, although {{there is some evidence that}} they may accept the principle, and advice on checking quick release tension has been strengthened. [...] A complete solution to ejection risk would involve mounting the front disc brake caliper in front of the fork blade rather than behind, as the reaction force on the disc would then be into, rather than out of, the fork-end. However, this would involve major retooling by fork and brake manufacturers, though at least one manufacturer has placed the disc caliper mounts on the front of the right fork blade. This allows standard disc brakes to be used, and also makes it easier to mount mudguards.|$|E
40|$|The {{nature of}} failure in a Turn buckle is investigated. It {{was found that}} the {{fracture}} had occured at the rivet hole close to the <b>fork</b> <b>end.</b> Electron microscope study of the fracture surface showed that the <b>fork</b> <b>end</b> of the turn buckle had failed by a fatigue initiated fracture and that the fatigue could have originated due to excessive clearance in this region...|$|E

50|$|Bicycle forks {{usually have}} an offset, or rake (not to be {{confused}} with a different use of the word rake in the motorcycle world), that places the <b>fork</b> <b>ends</b> forward of the steering axis. This is achieved by curving the blades forward, angling straight blades forward, or by placing the <b>fork</b> <b>ends</b> forward of the centerline of the blades. The latter is used in suspension forks that must have straight blades in order for the suspension mechanism to work. Curved fork blades can also provide some shock absorption.|$|R

40|$|Glass {{beams and}} fins are {{frequently}} used in practice as stiffeners for roof and façade panels, and the mechanical interaction {{between them is}} often given by continuous silicone sealant joints. As a result, differing from traditional steel–concrete or timber–concrete sections, the so assembled systems behave as coupled laterally restrained (LR) assemblies with intermediate flexible joints, whose LTB structural contributions depend {{on a combination of}} multiple aspects. Since for design purposes a proper estimation of the theoretical LTB resistance of LR glass beams is a priority for a first assessment of the expected buckling response, {{as well as for the}} development of standardized design methods (e. g. design buckling curves, etc.), in this paper the strengthening effect of structural silicone joints on the LTB response of monolithic glass beams under constant bending moment is first investigated, based on analytical models derived from literature and extended finite element-numerical calculations. The validity and accuracy of existing closed-form solutions is verified for a wide set of geometrical and mechanical configurations of practical interest for structural glass applications. The effects of combined joint shear stiffnesses, beam slenderness and aspect ratios, load distributions and point of applications are emphasized both in terms of critical buckling moments and corresponding fundamental modal shapes. Correction coefficients are then also properly calibrated and proposed for a suitable calculation of the Euler’s critical buckling resistance of <b>fork</b> <b>end</b> restrained LR glass beams with shear flexible sealant joints and subjected to distributed loads or mid-span concentrated loads applied at both the top or bottom edges...|$|E
