50|$|At 9:45 a.m. {{the tunnel}} {{ventilation}} system was turned to full extract and full {{supply in the}} zone of the fire (zone S4). The supply of air through the duct under the roadway enabled firefighters to work without masks (by taking breaths from the air coming through the supply flues at curb level).The extract duct above the roadway captured some of the smoke and when the false ceiling {{at the site of}} the fire collapsed, a hole formed between the road tunnel and the <b>extract</b> <b>ventilation</b> duct: this hole dramatically improved the capture of smoke at the main fire site, though it reduced smoke capture at the second fire site to practically nothing.|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{ventilation}} is {{to guarantee}} a good indoor air quality, related to the energy consumed for heating and fan(s). Active or passive heat recovery systems seem {{to focus on the}} reduction of heating consumption at the expense of fan electricity consumption and maintenance. In this study, demandcontrolled mechanical <b>extract</b> <b>ventilation</b> systems of Renson (DCV 1 and DCV 2), based on natural supply in the habitable rooms and mechanical extraction in the wet rooms (or even the bedrooms), was analysed for one year by means of multi-zone Contam simulations on a reference detached house and compared with standard MEV and mechanical <b>extract</b> <b>ventilation</b> systems with heat recovery (MVHR). To this end, IAQ, total energy consumption, CO 2 emissions and total cost of the systems are determined. The results show that DCV systems with increased supply air flow rates or direct mechanical extract from bedrooms can significantly improve IAQ, while reducing total energy consumption compared to MEV. Applying DCV reduces primary heating energy consumption and yearly fan electricity consumption at most by 65 % to 50 % compared to MEV. Total operational energy costs and CO 2 emissions of DCV are similar when compared to MVHR. Total costs of DCV systems over 15 years are smaller when compared to MVHR due to lower investment and maintenance costs...|$|E

50|$|Typically, intake (fresh) air travels up {{the main}} gate, across the face, {{and then down}} the tail gate, known as 'U' type ventilation. Once past the face the air is no longer fresh air, but return air {{carrying}} away coal dust and mine gases such as methane, carbon dioxide, depending on the geology of the coal. Return air is <b>extracted</b> by <b>ventilation</b> fans mounted on the surface. Other ventilation methods can be used where intake air also passes the main gate and into a bleeder or back return road reducing gas emissions from the goaf onto the face, or intake air travels up the tail gate and across the face {{in the same direction}} as the face chain in a homotropal system.|$|R
40|$|Improved energy {{performance}} standards are resulting in better insulated and more airtight building. In such buildings ventilation {{can be provided}} by natural means alone or in conjunction with <b>extract</b> mechanical <b>ventilation</b> or with wholehouse mechanical ventilation with or without heat recovery. This paper reports on a study funded by the NHBC Foundation of the indoor environment of eight super-insulated homes with natural and decentralised ventilation systems {{in the south of}} the UK. The aim was to examine the effectiveness of such ventilation options. The buildings were monitored for one year in relation to temperature, relative humidity, CO 2, CO, NO 2, CH 2 O and TVOC. The building occupants’ feedback and IES building modelling triangulated the site data. The study showed natural and decentralised ventilation systems provided good air quality in the case study buildings and allowed users to create comfortable thermally differentiate environments in response to their preferences...|$|R
40|$|Decommissioning of the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant {{involves}} multiple problems. One {{of them is}} personnel {{radiation safety}} during the performance of dismantling activities. In this paper, modeling results of radiation doses during {{the dismantling of the}} pressurized tank from the emergency core cooling system (ECCS PT) of RBMK- 1500 reactor are presented. The radiological surveys indicate that the inner surface of the ECCS PT is contaminated with radioactive products of corrosion and sediments due to the radioactive water. The effective doses to the workers have been modeled for different strategies of ECCS PT dismantling. In order to select the optimal personnel radiation safety, the modeling has been performed by the means of computer code “VISIPLAN 3 D ALARA Planning tool” developed by SCK CEN (Belgium). The impacts of dismantling tools, shielding types, and <b>extract</b> <b>ventilation</b> flow rate on effective doses during the dismantling of ECCS PT have been analyzed. The total effective personnel doses have been obtained by summarizing the effective personnel doses from various sources of exposure, that is, direct radiation from radioactive equipment, internal radiation due to inhalation of radioactive aerosols, and direct radiation from radioactive aerosols arising during hot cutting in premises. The uncertainty of the collective doses is also presented in this paper...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} some of the most recent tests {{involving}} a number of studies in an unoccupied radon test house. The house has a suspended timber floor and naturally elevated indoor radon levels, peaking at times above 6000 Bqm 3. Various sensors monitor how different ventilation strategies affect indoor radon levels and the building environment Data from five different scenarios is presented. Initially the house was monitored as purchased with poor natural underfloor ventilation. This was followed by testing whole house pressurisation, improved natural undcrfloor ventilation, and two types of mechanical underfloor ventilation. The results from these and future studies may be used to make a more informed choice of remedy, based on a whole number of aspects, not only radon reduction as is frequently the case. DEFINITIONS To assist the reader it is necessary to explain some of the terms used in this paper. Airbrick a purpose built vent positioned in the external wall of an underfloor space to promote air movement Underfloor space: the space beneath a suspended floor. In the US this {{is often referred to as}} the crawl-space. In the UK such spaces are commonly inaccessible and poorly ventilated. Underfloor extract ventilation: mechanical <b>extract</b> <b>ventilation</b> of the underfloor space. Air is discharged to the outside. Underfloor supply ventilation: mechanical simply ventilation of outside air to the underflow space. Spillage: the flow of combustion gases into the room in which the combustion appliance is sited.

30|$|For {{secondary}} outcomes, as {{the heterogeneity}} of available data, this meta-analysis did not find a significant reduction of ICU LOS after IVIgGM administration. ICU stay is a heterogeneous variable per se. Numerous social factors complicated with medical resources control influent the length of ICU stay [40]. More reliable parameters like ventilation duration or free of ventilation days (VFDs) {{should be considered in}} clinical trials. With the available data <b>extracted</b> from literatures, <b>ventilations</b> days are significantly reduced in IVIgGM group patients, however, IVIgGM use did not increase VFDs (Additional file 6 : Figure S 3). Further research should evaluate this respiratory benefit.|$|R
30|$|Three {{factors can}} explain {{a change in}} EtCO 2 : {{pulmonary}} blood flow (usually equal to cardiac output), CO 2 metabolic production, and alveolar ventilation [21]. Naturally, if two of these factors are constant, {{the change in the}} third factor can explain the variation of EtCO 2. Two mechanisms can also explain EtCO 2 variation. First, a fluid challenge increases venous return and pulmonary blood flow; thus, a greater amount of CO 2 delivery to the lungs and removal by alveolar ventilation should be observed. Second, a fluid challenge recruits collapsed pulmonary blood capillaries and, therefore, reduces West zones 1 and 2 and increases zone 3 [22]. Consequently, the ventilation/perfusion ratio decreases and dead space is reduced enabling more CO 2 to be <b>extracted</b> by alveolar <b>ventilation.</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{links the}} anatomy of the {{peripheral}} olfactory organ in the bottom-dwelling round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) with behavioural responses to putative pheromones and conspecific extracts. The spatial organization of the nasal cavity was examined using impression material injection, immunocytochemistry, and transmission electron microscopy. The peripheral olfactory organ had a compact structure with an olfactory chamber that contained a single longitudinal lamella. Prominent dorsocaudal lachrymal and ethmoid accessory nasal sacs were situated ventrocaudal to the chamber. The location of the olfactory mucosa within the olfactory chamber is novel for teleost fish, as it extends dorsally beyond the ventral surface. Microvillar and ciliated olfactory sensory neurons were identified by transmission electron microscopy. Galphaolf-immunoreactive ciliated olfactory sensory neurons and Galpha 0 -immunoreactive microvillar olfactory sensory neurons were located throughout the olfactory epithelium. Galpha 0 -immunoreactive crypt cells were also found throughout the olfactory epithelium of some specimens. The effect of female conspecific urogenital <b>extracts</b> on <b>ventilation</b> was studied on male round gobies. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) Dept. of Biological Sciences.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experimental}} tests {{was carried out}} in two 1 / 15 reduced-scale tunnels to investigate ceiling temperature distribution and smoke diffusion in tunnel fires with natural ventilation. Based on experimental results and the one-dimensional theory, formulas to predict the temperature distribution and smoke diffusion extent were developed. As the smoke was <b>extracted</b> through natural <b>ventilation</b> shafts, the tunnel was conceptually divided into two zones or sections: the fire and non-fire sections. In both sections, the smoke temperature can be expressed using the temperature decay formula and reference temperature formula. The temperature decay is an exponential function. The reference temperature in the fire section can be developed from the definition of the dimensionless temperature and a constant value that is different for different tunnels. The reference temperature in the non-fire section represents the relationship between the dimensionless reference temperature in the non-fire section and a constant value that is different for different tunnels. The smoke diffusion area represents the relationship between the dimensionless length of the smoke layer and the temperature decay at the location of smoke.

40|$|Recent {{research}} has characterised emissions upon cooking {{a variety of}} foods in a commercial catering environment in terms of volume, particle size and composition. However, there has been limited focus on the deposition of solid grease in commercial kitchen ductwork, the sustainability of these systems and their implications on the heat recovery potential of kitchen <b>ventilation</b> <b>extract</b> air. This paper reviews the literature concerning grease, {{commonly referred to as}} Fat, Oils and Grease (FOG) abatement strategies and finds that many of these systems fall short of claimed performances. Furthermore these technologies often add to the energy cost of the operation and reduce the potential application of heat recovery in the ventilation ductwork. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop and evaluate a novel FOG removal system, with a focus on low environmental impact. The novel FOG removal system, utilises the biological activity of Bacillus subtilis and associated enzymes. The biological reagent is delivered via a misting system.

40|$|The Karavanke tunnel {{forms an}} {{important}} link between Slovenia and Austria. The almost 8 km long tunnel is operated with bi-directional traffic {{and does not}} have dedicated escape routes. Moreover, the ventilation in case of fire does not satisfy requirements of the EU Directive 2004 / 54 /EC that specifies the minimum requirements for tunnels in the trans-European road network. The paper present results of the research conducted regarding the possibility of upgrade the existing system {{in order to reach}} the required level of safety at lower costs possible. It is shown that with simple but novel adaptations of the ventilation system, a sizeable increase in the overall level of safety can be achieved. The methodology applied is a combination of a simple pipe model for tunnel ventilation and for detailed fluid dynamics analysis the CFD model is used. The existing ventilation system that in fire <b>ventilation</b> <b>extracts</b> smoke from a single duct is replaced with the smoke extraction from both ducts applying four axial fans. The analysis is focused on air/smoke flow through the vents and ducts and on pressure drops calculated over the length of the ventilation duct and its influence on the total flow. The change of the flow condition also has influence on ventilation fan operation point that is investigated in the paper as well...|$|R
