25|$|Historians have {{commented on}} her {{reluctance}} {{to write about}} slavery. Perhaps <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> had conflicting feelings about the institution. In the poem above, critics have said that she praises slavery because it brought her to Christianity. But, in another poem, she wrote that slavery was a cruel fate.|$|E
500|$|The {{death of}} Capt. William P. Halliday {{is a great}} loss to Cairo. [...] It will take {{the people of this}} city a long time to {{appreciate}} how much of a friend he was. [...] His resources were so great and his willingness to help was always to be relied upon. [...] Cairo has won a great reputation as a host, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> had a Capt. Halliday. [...] When there was any entertainment of distinguished guests to be planned, it was done on a magnificent scale because Capt. Halliday’s purse was drawn upon for such {{a large part of the}} bill. [...] In this way Cairo won fame as a hospitable city. [...] She was able to outdo her rivals who had no Capt. Hallidays. [...] Now Cairo will have to fall back on a plane with the others.|$|E
500|$|To the amazement of all {{the other}} boys, Kenny has a girlfriend: fifth grader Tammy Warner. Butters hears a rumor that Tammy is a slut because she gave another male student a [...] "B.J." [...] in a T.G.I. Friday's parking lot. Hoping to spare Kenny's feelings, Stan, Kyle, and Cartman decide to warn him. To their bewilderment, Kenny's {{reaction}} is excitement and happiness. Kenny invites Tammy to go with him to T.G.I. Friday's after school, at which point she confesses that the rumor about her is true. Not noticing his delight, she explains that the only reason she did <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> became aroused after watching the Jonas Brothers perform. Consequently, Kenny, hoping she will give him a [...] "B.J." [...] as well, takes Tammy to a Jonas Brothers concert at the Pepsi Center. His friends are disgusted by his intent; Cartman claims that [...] "the most bacteria-ridden place on the planet is the mouth of an American woman." ...|$|E
5000|$|Squerciati {{liked her}} character's [...] "energy and happiness" [...] and said, [...] "I'm hoping that she {{maintains}} {{some of that}} joy. I think part of <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>she's</b> green, but another part of <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>she's</b> a driven, joyful person. She knows what she wants." [...] Squerciati liked that Burgess was not the perfect officer and made mistakes, as she found it very relatable.|$|R

6000|$|... "The other tree answered, 'Yes, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> has {{no one to}} play with. Little Niebla by {{the river}} refused to play with her <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> not beautifully dressed.' ...|$|R
500|$|Regarding the {{controversial}} period of her career, Madonna said, [...] "I feel I've been misunderstood. I {{tried to make}} a statement about feeling good about yourself and exploring your sexuality, but people took it to mean that everyone should go out and have sex with everyone, and that I {{was going to be the}} leader of that. So I decided to leave it alone because that's what everyone ended up concentrating on. Sex is such a taboo subject and it's such a distraction that I'd rather not even offer it up." [...] During 1994, Madonna started recording her sixth studio album. She collaborated with R producers such as Dallas Austin, Dave [...] "Jam" [...] Hall, and Babyface, and also enlisting British producer Nellee Hooper to the project. It became one of the very few occasions where she collaborated with well-known producers, the first since Nile Rodgers on Like a Virgin (1984). When asked about the record, Madonna said she wanted people to concentrate on the musical aspects of it, and would like the songs to speak for themselves. She also commented that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> was not interested in giving many interviews and being on the cover of magazines. She described the album as [...] "a combination of pop, R, hip-hop and a Madonna record. It's very, very romantic". In an interview with The Face magazine, Madonna explained her inspirations behind Bedtime Stories as well as the reason for teaming up with R song producers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} Broadway {{production at}} the Eugene O'Neill Theatre was marred by problems even before it opened. Eve Arden in the lead role was seeking a return to Broadway after 40 years, but dropped out after the second preview. [...] This {{was said to be}} due to [...] "artistic differences"—but another source has suggested that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> could not remember her lines. [...] Her role was then filled by veteran star Holland Taylor. The complete cast was as follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|After Nina Gordon {{finished}} promoting Tonight and the Rest of My Life in late 2001, {{she took}} a break and began writing material for her second solo album. However, she didn't get into the studio again until late 2003. Reasons for this two-year delay are uncertain, but Gordon says <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> {{wanted to write a}} lot of great material. To tide fans over, Gordon released B-side material from Tonight on her website and a demo for a song called [...] "The Time Comes", which was featured in the independent movie, Stealing Innocence.|$|E

60|$|GEORGE. I {{do think}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> so loyal, and good and {{straight}} that I saw so clearly what a cad I was. I think I found {{courage to do}} the only possible thing in her frankness and honesty.|$|R
2500|$|... "It {{was in the}} perilous {{fires of}} the Carter {{administration}} that my ideology was forged," [...] she wrote. [...] "In the seventies, Carter taught me what I was against, {{and then in the}} eighties, Reagan taught me what I was for." [...] She also details why she {{went to work for the}} Internal Revenue Service. She says <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> wanted to change the tax code, [...] "from the inside out." [...] She also commented on her role as a Tea Party leader. [...] "I once said that the Tea Party represents 90 percent of Americans. I now realize that I misspoke," [...] she admitted. [...] "I should have said 100 percent, because I believe that nearly all Americans retain faith in the ordered liberty that the Constitution offers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Philip's husband, {{brother and}} family dispute {{much of what}} the police say and their interpretations of the {{documentary}} evidence. She was fired from Cabrini not because of alcoholism but because she had been a [...] "whistleblower" [...] who complained about racial and sexual bias (the hospital later told a reporter it had no evidence of any formal complaints by her). Lieberman says that while his wife frequented lesbian bars, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> did not want a repeat of the situation that had happened with her coworker. She never had sex with the women she went home with, he claims, and they would often merely listen to music, sleep or paint. One time, in fact, she came home covered with paint after going home with an artist. Her drinking was a temporary phase to ease her through the depression she was experiencing after being fired by Cabrini, and would stop once her life got back to normal, as he believed it was doing.|$|E
2500|$|After {{a series}} of legal {{proceedings}} the Federal District Court ordered the Little Rock School District to proceed with its integration plans when school opened on September 4, 1957. Governor Orval Faubus ordered the Arkansas National Guard to Little Rock Central High School on September 4, 1957, because {{he said he had}} evidence (although none was shown) that there was [...] "...imminent danger of tumult, riot and breach of peace and the doing of violence to persons and property." [...] The governor initially ordered to state duty the State Headquarters Detachment, the Base Detachment at Adams Field and any other units the Adjutant General felt necessary to [...] "accomplish the mission of maintaining or restoring law and order and to preserve the peace, health, safety and security of the citizens of Pulaski County, Arkansas." [...] On September 4, Elizabeth Eckford was the only student to enter the school due to lack of communication. It is commonly mistaken that she was taking this stand on her own but rather <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> was the only student who didn't have a phone so nobody could contact her to let her know the integration wasn't happening until the next day.|$|E
50|$|Tate also {{visits the}} house before the fights and has a {{discussion}} with Peña.

2500|$|Sue is {{initially}} presented as the glee club's [...] "arch-nemesis". Following the pilot episode, Lynch {{said she is}} [...] "pure evil and doesn't hide it", explaining that she was created {{as a product of}} Murphy, Brennan and Falchuk's [...] "inner mean girl". Lynch feels that Sue has the ability to be both [...] "horrible and really delightful at the same time", assessing that she continually speaks her mind as she enjoys appalling people with the things she says. She encapsulates Sue's world view as being about [...] "power and winning", stating that she will do anything to win. Sue's softer side manifests following the revelation that her sister has Down syndrome. She is depicted as kind and loving towards Jean, though Lynch stated that exploration of Sue's humanity would be limited. Sue is an atheist, but according to Murphy, does not want to be. He explained, [...] "She [...] saying to the world, 'Prove [...] wrong: If God is kindness and love, make me believe in God.'" [...] The second-season episode [...] "Grilled Cheesus" [...] focuses on the characters' differing approaches to religion. Sue lobbies against the performance of spiritual songs in school, engaging in a philosophical argument on the matter with school guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays), which Murphy describes as the scene he is [...] "most proud to have been involved with in [...] entire career." [...] On the fifth-season episode [...] "Puppet Master", the reason behind Sue's track suit outfit was revealed. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>she</b> felt that she never received the respect she deserved as a teacher and even the then Principal Figgins [...] "insulted" [...] her and said that she was a cheerleading coach so she needed to [...] "try some pants" [...] because she was wearing an office skirt and that she had long hair. She said that the moment she put the track suit on, [...] "the world bowed before her" [...] and that she [...] "had one made in every color".|$|E
