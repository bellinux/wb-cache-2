5|$|In 1848, {{acting on}} these {{feelings}} and perceptions, Stanton joined Mott, Mott's sister Martha Coffin Wright, Jane Hunt {{and a handful}} of other women in Seneca Falls. Together they organized the Seneca Falls Convention held in Seneca Falls on July 19 and 20. Over 300 people attended. Stanton drafted a Declaration of Sentiments, which she read at the convention. Modeled on the United States Declaration of Independence, Stanton's declaration proclaimed that men and women are created equal. She proposed, among other things, a then-controversial resolution demanding voting rights for women. The final resolutions, including female suffrage, were passed, <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>small</b> <b>measure,</b> because of the support of Frederick Douglass, who attended and informally spoke at the convention.|$|E
5|$|Goldfaden {{was both}} a {{theoretician}} and a practitioner of theater. That he was <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>small</b> <b>measure</b> a theoretician – for example, he was interested almost from the start in having set design seriously support the themes of his plays – relates to a key property of Yiddish theater {{at the time of}} its birth: in general, writes Bercovici, theory ran ahead of practice. Much of the Jewish community, Goldfaden included, were already familiar with contemporary theater in other languages. The initial itinerary of Goldfaden's company – Iaşi, Botoşani, Galaţi, Brăila, Bucharest – could as easily have been the itinerary of a Romanian-language troupe. Yiddish theater may have been seen from the outset as an expression of a Jewish national character, but the theatrical values of Goldfaden's company were in many ways those of a good Romanian theater of the time. Also, Yiddish was a German dialect which became a well-known language even among non-Jews in Moldavia (and Transylvania), an important language of commerce; the fact that one of the first to write about Yiddish theater was Romania's national poet, Mihai Eminescu, is testimony that interest in Yiddish theater went beyond the Jewish community.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} noted that the {{creative}} ideology of Nsukka Art School lays much emphasis on {{the exploration of the}} environment as potent creative sources of ideas, materials and forms, which has <b>in</b> <b>no</b> <b>small</b> <b>measures</b> contributed and also resulted in the appropriation of culture based art forms as viable creative resources. It is this exploration that permeates the various areas of art in the school. For instance, in the area of painting, the use of clay, other earth pigments and local pots for media, ground and supports are clearly the resultant effects and the gain of this restless search for down- to- earth materials for painting. Therefore, this paper sets to review the conventional paradigm and then underscore the paradigm shift to ascertain what gave rise to their usage, origin, as well as their advantages and disadvantages over the conventional ground, supports and media. Examples of works rendered in this manner will be used as visuals for easier comprehension. However, it has been found that the use of earth pigments and clay pots for supports, ground and media is aesthetically appealing, highly innovative and far cheaper to acquire than conventional painting materials...|$|R

Celticists {{associated with the}} college include Sir John Rhys, Sir John Morris-Jones, and Sir Thomas (T. H.)

Nigel Hitchin, the Savilian Professor of Geometry at Oxford since 1997, studied at the college, as did Edward Hinds (a physicist who won the Rumford Medal in 2008), Chris Rapley (director of the Science Museum), and the zoologists Edward Bagnall Poulton and James Brontë Gatenby.|$|E

They arrived at Hay on 7 September 1940 in four trains from Sydney and were interned in Camps 7 and 8 (located near the Hay showground) under the guard of the 16th Garrison Battalion of the Australian Army.|$|E
