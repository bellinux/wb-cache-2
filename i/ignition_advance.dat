And Clonal Selection Algorithm (CSA) as one kind of searching methods adopted group search strategy, exchanged information between antibodies and achieved global optimal solution search by simulating the high variation and cloning characteristics of B lymphocyte. A simulation model of the best <b>ignition</b> <b>advanced</b> angle of hydrogen-fueled engine based on CSA was constructed. The advantages of CSA and the features of BP neural network were all adopted in this model.

50|$|During engine {{operations}} the Ignition cassette continuously {{monitors the}} ion currents in the cylinders and sends {{a signal to}} the Trionic ECU, pin 44, in an event of knocking. The logic for this function rests solely in the ignition cassette and is adaptive {{to be able to handle}} disturbing fuel additives. The Trionic ECU is well aware which cylinder that has ignited and could hence cope with the information feed through one pin. The signal to pin 44 and ion current in the combustion chamber is related to each other, when this signal reaches a certain level the ECU interprets this as a knocking event and firstly lowering the <b>ignition</b> <b>advance</b> by 1,5° on this cylinder. If the knocking is repeated the <b>ignition</b> <b>advance</b> is lowered further 1,5 ° up to 12°. In case of the same lowering of the ignition timing advance in all cylinders the ECU adds a small amount of fuel to all cylinders. If knocking occurs when the MAP is over 140 kPa the knocking is regulated by switching both fuel injection matrix and <b>ignition</b> <b>advance</b> matrix. If this is not sufficient the charging pressure is lowered. This purpose of this procedure is to maintain good performance. If the signal between the ignition cassette and the ECU is lost, the charging pressure is lowered to basic charging pressure and the ignition timing advance is lowered 12° when it exist a risk of knocking due to engine load.|$|E
50|$|Lighter weights or heavier springs {{can be used}} {{to reduce}} the timing advance at lower engine RPM. Heavier weights or lighter springs {{can be used to}} advance the timing at lower engine RPM. Usually, {{at some point in the}} engine's RPM range, these weights contact their travel limits, and the amount of {{centrifugal}} <b>ignition</b> <b>advance</b> is then fixed above that rpm.|$|E
30|$|The {{results show}} that BMEP {{increased}} with <b>ignition</b> timing <b>advance.</b> This expected that BMEP decrease with closing ignition time to top dead center.

In this case we lose the ability to expend {{this portion of the}} gas and decreasing performance. If the <b>ignition</b> is too <b>advance,</b> much portion of gas will burn while the piston is still rising; the work that must be done to compress this gas will decrease the net work produced.

50|$|Due to the {{downward}} {{movement of the}} pistons and the restriction caused by the throttle valve, in a reciprocating spark ignition piston engine, a partial vacuum (lower than atmospheric pressure) exists in the intake manifold.

50|$|Performance {{gains are}} {{realized}} {{by adjusting the}} <b>ignition</b> timing <b>advance.</b> Different timing may result in better performance. However, to cope with advanced timing, one must run high-octane gasoline to avoid pre-ignition detonation or pinging.

30|$|The above figure {{shows that}} Indicated Mean Effective Pressure (IMEP) tends to {{increase}} with <b>ignition</b> timing <b>advance</b> between 21 and 41 ° BTDC. It {{is expected that}} IMEP should increase with timing angle advance to a point, and then drop off. Best performance will be achieved when the greatest portion of the combustion takes place near top dead center. If the ignition timing is not advanced enough, the piston will already be moving down when much of the combustion takes place. In this case we lose the ability to expand {{this portion of the}} gas through the full range, decreasing performance. If the ignition timing is too advanced, too much of the gas will burn while the piston is still rising. The work that must be done to compress this gas will decrease the net work produced. These competing effects cause there to be a maximum in the IMEP as a function of <b>ignition</b> timing <b>advance.</b>|$|R
50|$|Under ideal {{conditions}} the common {{internal combustion engine}} burns the fuel/air mixture in the cylinder in an orderly and controlled fashion. The combustion is started by the spark plug some 10 to 40 crankshaft degrees prior to top dead center (TDC), depending on many factors including engine speed and load. This <b>ignition</b> <b>advance</b> allows time for the combustion process to develop peak pressure at the ideal time for maximum recovery of work from the expanding gases.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} study the effect of hot EGR on {{combustion}} characteristic of hydrogen internal combustion engine (HICE), experimental study was taken on a 4 cylinder, 2. 0 L HICE. The speed was 3000 rpm, and the throttle was fully open, the load was adjusted through quality regulation. When the hydrogen flow ratio was 2. 79 kg /h, the <b>ignition</b> <b>advanced</b> angle was optimized as maximum brake torque (MBT) timing, then the EGR valve was opened, and EGR valve was adjusted to control the flow of exhaust gas that back into the intake manifold. The test results show that: as the EGR ratio changing from 0 (the EGR valve is fully closed) to 43. 8 %(the EGR valve is fully opened), the in-cylinder pressure is decreasing with the EGR ratio increasing; the coefficient of variation in indicated mean effective pressure (imepCOV) is not changing significantly at high load conditions, changing range is less than 1 %; CA 50 is postponed from 11. 8 o CAto 15. ...|$|R

50|$|As {{with all}} Packards to date, the Model G's engine was {{placed under the}} driver's bench and {{laterally}} mounted, the crank protruding out of the right side. As mentioned, it {{was derived from the}} single-cylinder variant for which Packard already had a good reputation. Construction consisted of two single-cylinder engines that were connected in a horizontal opposed position and worked on a common crank shaft. Blocks were cast iron with non-detachable cylinder heads. Cylinders had a bore and stroke of 6 x 6 1/2 in. (152.4 × 165.1 mm) each, resulting in a displacement of 184 c.i (3,015 cm³) per cylinder and huge 368 c.i. (6,030 cm³) for the whole engine. Packard used a Longuemar float-feed carburetor for each cylinder. <b>Ignition</b> <b>advance</b> was manual. Power rating (following then-actual practice) was 24 H.P.|$|E
50|$|The two sparks plugs on the 8V Alfa Twin Spark engines fire at {{the same}} time and are symmetrically placed around the {{vertical}} line passing through the intake and exhaust valve centers. The flame front travels less distance which allows less <b>ignition</b> <b>advance</b> to be used. Also, leaner mixtures can also be tolerated for better fuel economy. The 8V engine also has 8 identical spark plugs. There is no room for a centrally positioned spark plug due to 2-valve design which uses rather large 44 mm diameter inlet valve on the 2.0 engine. On the newer models using the 8V engine the system uses the popular wasted spark system as well. (as also used in Ford EDIS), combining one coil for 2 plugs on opposite phase sister cylinders like 1-4, 2-3 on 4 cylinder engine. (similar setup with 3 coils for 6 cylinders is used on Alfa V6 engines).|$|E
5000|$|Turbulence, as stated, {{has very}} {{important}} effect on knock. Engines with good turbulence tend to knock less than engines with poor turbulence. Turbulence occurs not only while {{the engine is}} inhaling but also when the mixture is compressed and burned. Many pistons are designed to use [...] "squish" [...] turbulence to violently mix the air and fuel together as they are ignited and burned, which reduces knock greatly by speeding up burning and cooling the unburnt mixture. One {{example of this is}} all modern side valve or flathead engines. A considerable portion of the head space is made to come in close proximity of the piston crown, making for much turbulence near TDC. In the early days of side valve heads this was not done and a much lower compression ratio had to be used for any given fuel. Also such engines were sensitive to <b>ignition</b> <b>advance</b> and had less power.|$|E
40|$|A new {{conceptual}} {{design of the}} laser fusion power plant FALCON-D (Fast <b>ignition</b> <b>Advanced</b> Laser fusion reactor CONcept with a Dry wall chamber) has been proposed. The fast ignition method can achieve the sufficient fusion gain for a commercial operation (~ 100) with about 10 times smaller fusion yield than the conventional central ignition method. FALCON-D makes full use of this property and aims at designing with a compact dry wall chamber (5 ~ 6 m radius). 1 -D/ 2 -D hydrodynamic simulations showed {{the possibility of the}} sufficient gain achievement with a 40 MJ target yield. The design feasibility of the compact dry wall chamber and solid breeder blanket system was shown through the thermomecanical analysis of the dry wall and neutronics analysis of the blanket system. A moderate electric output (~ 400 MWe) can be achieved with a high repetition (30 Hz) laser. This dry wall concept not only reduces some difficulties accompanied with a liquid wall but also enables a simple cask maintenance method for the replacement of the blanket system, which can shorten the maintenance time. The basic idea of the maintenance method for the final optics system has also been proposed. Some critical R&D issues required for this design are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{propagation}} rates (Uedge) of non-premixed <b>ignition</b> (<b>advancing)</b> fronts and extinction (retreating) edge-flames {{were measured}} {{as a function}} of global strain rate (σ), jet spacing (d), mixture strength, stoichiometric mixture fraction (Zst) and Lewis number (Le) using a counterflow slot-jet burner in which edge-flames propagated along its long dimension. Electrical heaters {{at both ends of the}} slot “anchored ” the flames, allowing conditions resulting in negative values of Uedge to be studied by triggering local extinction of anchored flames with an N 2 jet. Results are presented in terms of the effects of a dimensionless flame thickness (ε) related to σ and a dimensionless heat loss (κ) on a scaled Uedge. Propagation rates were markedly enhanced/retarded in mixtures with low/high Le. Propagation rates and extinction conditions were highly asymmetric with respect to Zst = 0. 5 despite the symmetry of flame location; mixtures with Zst greater/less than 0. 5 behaved like stronger/weaker mixtures, apparently due to the relative locations of the radical production zone and maximum temperature zone for varying Zst. Two extinction limits were identified, corresponding to a high-σ strain-induced limit that was strongly dependent on Le but nearly independent of κ and a low-σ heat loss induced limi...|$|R

5000|$|The fifth {{generation}} Celica {{was introduced}} in September 1989 for the 1990 model year. The Celica received new Super Round organic styling, upgraded wheels and tires, more powerful GT-Four (All-Trac Turbo in the US) with better cooling system, and for the Japanese market only, the four-wheel steering (4WS) models. Toyota engineers claimed that the round styling and lack of straight edges increased strength without adding weight. The styling was later copied by other manufacturers. Japanese market models were now S-R, Z-R, GT-R, Active Sports (first Toyota with Toyota Active Control Suspension), and GT-Four. The S-R and Z-R were powered by a 3S-FE engine, while the GT-R and Active Sports came with a 3S-GE.

5000|$|The {{original}} design weight was 1400 kg, however noise and safety concerns pushed this up to 1535 kg. It is popularly {{believed that the}} Bora is heavier than the Ghibli however the Ghibli weighs some 1650 kg, 115 kg more than the Bora. The reason for this misconception probably stems {{from the state of}} tune of their respective engines as well as the difference in the gearing of the two cars. The Ghiblis' 4.7 litre motor was tuned to give 335 bhp in SS form, whilst the 310 bhp Bora was tuned for a smoother power delivery but more initial <b>ignition</b> <b>advance</b> gave it more power lower in the rev range. Differences in the gearing are a little harder to understand, the Ghibli had the option of two final drives 3.31 or 3.54 both of these lower than the Boras' 4.11 in US form or 3.77 for the few rhd cars, also having a 2.97 first gear verses 2.86 in the Bora made the heavier but more powerful Ghibli accelerate at almost exactly the same rate as the Bora, initially. However as speed climbed the more highly geared Bora ( [...] 5th gear of [...]74 verses [...]90 in the Ghibli [...] ) would take the lead, top speeds were similar at 154 to 160 for the Ghibli verses 155 mph for US spec Boras' and up to 174 mph for rhd and European spec cars without smog controls. You can see why there is so much confusion over this issue as well as the top speeds of US spec verses European geared cars! The first Boras were delivered to customers in late 1971, and only minor production changes were gradually phased in thereafter. About early 1974, front lids became hinged at front instead of rear, pop-up headlights showed rounded inside corners, and a rectangular black air-exit grille was added across the hood (similar to Pantera). From 1973, as the 4.7-litre engine had not been homologated in North America, US Bora models had air-pump emissions-equipped 4930cc Super-Ghibli engines similar to those found in US-bound Ghiblis. Output was [...] at 6000 rpm, only [...] or less than the Euro-spec' derivative.|$|E
