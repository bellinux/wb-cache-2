500|$|A jazz fusion album, Song of Innocence {{combines}} jazz elements with impressionistic musical {{figures and}} hard rock guitar solos. Its music also incorporates funk, rock, theatre, and pop styles. Music journalists categorized the record as jazz-rock, baroque pop, and psychedelic R. John Murph of JazzTimes magazine said the music {{could be better}} characterized as art pop than jazz. Axelrod, who had produced bebop albums before working for Capitol, asserted that jazz {{played a crucial role}} in the music: [...] "For years, all I did was jazz. When <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>got</b> in the record business, I was so into jazz that I had never heard Elvis Presley. I still probably listen to jazz more than anything else." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of [...] "Beside the Dying Fire," [...] a large prison {{is seen in the}} background hovering over the survivors' temporary settlement. Bear McCreary composed a score for the sequence, which he thought would lay the groundworks for a future theme for the location. [...] "There’s something really powerful there that could become, sort of like a heartbeat-like theme for this location, which is kind of similar to what I had in mind when I read the comics years ago when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>got</b> there," [...] he asserted. [...] "I had been thinking about it, there’s so many great prison shows and movies and there are certain sounds you kind of associate with it, and I don’t want to do that. But, we’ll see. I mean it really depends on where they take the show. It’s a little early to think about it, but I’m definitely thinking about it anyway." ...|$|E
500|$|Kinsler was {{promoted}} two levels on June 12 to the Double-A Frisco RoughRiders. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>got</b> called up, {{there were a}} million things running through my head", he said. [...] "I was nervous, my hands were sweating. It was really exciting, but I didn't know what to expect. I was a little nervous that ... {{all of a sudden}} I wouldn't be able to hit." [...] In June he was named the Rangers' Minor League Player of the Month. Frisco manager Tim Ireland observed: I think he's succeeding because his swing is graceful and effortless. It's just a smooth swing, and he hits for power because he lets his swing work for him. Defensively, so far he's shown a real feel for shortstop. He's got good feet and soft hands, and he throws well enough.... He seems pretty legit to me. In July, the Rangers agreed to send Kinsler and prospect right-hander Erik Thompson to the Colorado Rockies for Larry Walker, but Walker vetoed the trade.|$|E

5000|$|When <b>I</b> <b>first</b> heard Really <b>Got</b> Me", I said, [...] "Shit, it doesn't {{matter what}} you do with this, it's a number one song". It could have been done in waltz time {{and it would have been}} a hit. - Shel Talmy, {{producer}} of [...] "You Really Got Me" ...|$|R

500|$|Andrew Orloff, the Creative Director and Visual Effects Supervisor of Zoic Studios, {{considered}} the creature {{one of the}} most challenging effects his company helped make for the season. He explained that this and other designed monsters are [...] "really super fantastical, they’re really out there, the anatomy and the biology of them is so wild and crazy, that it really takes a lot to make it look real in the scene and make it a part of the actors are reacting to these things – to get the audience to believe in it is kind of the biggest challenge we’ve faced on the show so far." [...] During filming, the cast and crew referred to the monster as a [...] "were-upine" [...] or [...] "porcuman". Lance Reddick commented on set, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>got</b> here tonight, I was expecting zombies to come up out of the ground. And the actual creature looks so bizarre, I mean it really looks like something I wouldn't want to be caught in the woods with." [...] The crew spent over a week collecting and placing the plane wreckage together. According to Set Dresser Russ Griffin, the set included approximately 15,000 pounds worth of plane parts.|$|E
500|$|The group {{recruited}} Oteil Burbridge of the Aquarium Rescue Unit {{to replace}} Woody on bass, and Jack Pearson on guitar. Concerns arose over the increasing loudness of Allman Brothers shows, which were largely centered on Betts. Pearson, struggling with tinnitus, left {{as a result}} following the 1999 Beacon run. Trucks phoned his nephew, Derek Trucks, to join the band for their thirtieth anniversary tour. Trucks was very young, at age 20, and younger {{than any of the}} original members when the band formed. [...] "It was an honor to be part of such a great institution from the start," [...] said Derek Trucks. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>got</b> the gig, I was just trying to maintain the spirit of the whole thing while hopefully bringing some fire to it, hoping to hold up my end while also expressing my own voice." [...] The Beacon run in 2000, captured on Peakin' at the Beacon, was ironically considered among the band's worst performances; an eight-show spring tour led to even more strained relations in the group. [...] "It had ceased to be a band—everything had to be based around what Dickey was playing," [...] said Allman. Anger boiled over within the group towards Betts, which led to all original members sending him a letter, informing him of their intentions to tour without him for the summer.|$|E
500|$|Mullen has {{admitted}} his bass drum technique {{is not one}} of his strengths and has used a floor tom to his left to create the effect he wants (since The Unforgettable Fire era), using it for accents or in songs such as [...] "With or Without You", [...] "In God's Country", [...] "One" [...] and Pride (In the Name of Love)". Speaking in 1995, he said, [...] "When it came to recording 'Pride' for The Unforgettable Fire album, Danny [...] was able to pick up from me that I had some interesting ideas but here was a slight lack of focus. My kick drum technique was then, as it is now, completely underdeveloped and I {{never got a chance to}} practice and learn like most people would. In the marching bands, I only used a snare and when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>got</b> a kit, I never learned how to properly use all the elements together. So I went and listened to a basic demo of 'Pride' and tried to play a beat just using the kick and snare. But I couldn't get the kick to do what I wanted, so I got a floor tom down and did what I'd done in the past, which was if I couldn't physically do what was necessary, I'd find another way around it. I couldn't do what most people would consider a normal beat for the song, so I chose alternatives." ...|$|E
5000|$|Jossa's first {{appearance}} was on 27 September 2010. Jossa {{said that when}} she <b>first</b> <b>got</b> the part of Lauren, she [...] "worried unnecessarily". Talking to PA, Jossa said that working with Joyner and Wood was not as scary as she thought. She commented: [...] "There was less pressure than I thought {{there was going to}} be. When <b>I</b> <b>first</b> started <b>I</b> <b>got</b> really scared and worked up, thinking everyone's going to hate me. They've been there four years and then I'm coming in to be their daughter - it was a bit surreal. And then two weeks later I felt completely comfortable, everyone was cracking jokes and I thought, 'Oh... I built it up a bit!'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What I {{mean is that}} I can go to bed, and sleep, and get up and eat my meals {{without missing}} {{the sound of the}} {{trumpets}} so much as <b>I</b> did at <b>first.</b> <b>I</b> remember hearing of people who lived in a mill, and couldn't sleep when the mill stopped. It was like that with me when our mill stopped at <b>first.</b> <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> myself so used to the excitement of it, that I could hardly live without it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I couldn't speak any French when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> was <b>got</b> on board, sir, but I {{picked up}} {{a great deal on}} the voyage out. Jacques speaks English very well. He was a {{prisoner}} in England for three years, and learned it there, and it was that which caused him to speak to me directly he had got me on board, for no one else understood me. So he set to work at once to help me in my French, so that I could get along. The captain was very kind too. He said that as I had been picked up in that way he should not treat me as a prisoner; but he expected me to make myself useful, and, of course, I did so. It was the only way of having a comfortable life." ...|$|R

2500|$|When <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>got</b> {{picked for}} South Australia, Ian said, [...] "You {{got to decide}} what sort of a player {{you want to be}} – whether you want to be an aggressive, attacking player, or more like a {{grafting}} sort of player." [...] I had to think about that and that I'm not really a free hitter of the ball, so the choice I made was I was going {{to be more of a}} grafter.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{exception}} of her formative years when she was crowned a beauty queen, Peniston was struggling with her last name, constantly. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>got</b> in this business, People were actually erupting in fits of laughter when I introduced myself, but I was comfortable with who I was, but that was an issue for the record company," [...] she disclosed in 2006. [...] "But see {{in this day and}} age where I'm at, it wouldn't be a problem for the record company, I'm going to make sure that it's not. But for somebody who's getting into the business, realize that you're a commodity, and if the record company's investing in you, make sure you that you invest in yourself. Look is important because people see the physical first," [...] she was advising up-comers in the 5 Magazine interview.|$|E
60|$|No post-chaise {{was to be}} had. With {{incredible}} difficulty <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>first</b> a gig, then a man {{to drive}} it; and, last, a pony to draw it. We hobbled away crazily from the inn door. I thought of Screw and the Bow Street runner approaching Crickgelly, {{from their point of}} the compass, perhaps at the full speed of a good post-chaise--I thought of that, and would have given all the money in my pocket for two hours' use of a fast road-hack.|$|R

A party of English was below, and some of our men having joined them, the heads were knocked out of two barrels of whiskey. The kids and bread-bags were procured, and all hands, without distinction of country, sat down to enjoy themselves. Some even began to sing, and, as for good-fellowship, it was just as marked, as it would have been in a jollification ashore.|$|R

2500|$|The {{character}} was eventually {{to make his}} return in September 2007, reintroduced by executive producer Diederick Santer {{as part of a}} storyline that saw Ian being stalked and terrorised by a mystery person, claiming to be his deceased ex-wife Cindy. After weeks of watching Ian tormented, viewers saw Ian lured {{to the top of a}} deserted block of flats, where Ian came face to face with his harasser, Steven. For several weeks, Ian was kept locked up in the derelict flat, while Steven returned to Albert Square to bond with his brother and sister, Peter and Lucy. Aaron Sidwell was cast in the role of Steven, making him the fourth actor to play him. It was Sidwell's first television role, and he has described it as [...] "a bit daunting...but everyone was really welcoming...the first few directors I worked with were fantastic...After we did rehearsal, after we did a take, they'd always give me feedback...I needed it." [...] He added, [...] "I have been so lucky. Not many people get the chance to work on such a huge show, and my entrance was pretty impressive. I still wake up and think: 'Oh my God, I'm in EastEnders.' It's brilliant." [...] Describing the motives behind Steven's actions, Sidwell said [...] " [...] was raised for 13 years thinking he was Ian's son...but he wasn't...He sees Ian as the cause of Cindy's death, because Cindy died in prison, and she went to prison because Ian put her there...so that's how he kind of sees that it's Ian's fault...very narrow-minded... Steven is..a messed up kid and when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>got</b> the part I was given a catchphrase that describes him as a person...'look at me'...he wants to be in the limelight 100%...he wants people to be thinking about him ...that's why he got angry with Ian because Ian wasn't thinking about him... he's the most important person in the world." ...|$|E

5000|$|In mid-1972 Redfern {{toured the}} US with his mentor, Liberace. He was {{described}} by Australian Women's Weeklys Dita Cobb as [...] "a lovely contrast to the local product of his age. Americans adore him. He is so fresh and funny and unassuming and downright young. Nothing seems to have gone to his head." [...] Redfern remembered his early US performances, [...] "lt was great... I was nervous at <b>first.</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> songs in the wrong order and the band was playing different music from what I was singing.

One, Julius Schwartz, while unimpressed with the art, offered Saladino regular {{work as a}} letterer. Though working in the office, ensconced between letterer Ira Schnapp and production artist Mort Drucker, Saladino was employed as a freelancer, earning $2 a page and generally earning $90 a week. He recalled in a 2007 interview, [...] "DC wanted a full-time letterer and by being present <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>first</b> choice of assignments.
