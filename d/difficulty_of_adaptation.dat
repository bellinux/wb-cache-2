40|$|The {{personality}} traits in 61 consecutive patients affected by secondary amenorrhea requesting help for menstrual disorders were evaluated. Patients were administrated the reduced {{form of the}} Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) and a semistructured interview. Clinical, instrumental and neuroendocrine examinations were done, including plasma estrogens, luteinizing hormone (LH) pulsatility study, thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) test. Nine patients were excluded because the endocrine evaluation did not show evidence of certain pathological changes. The remaining 52 patients were considered for this study and {{divided into two groups}} according to the presence (16 cases) or the absence (36 cases) of an acute life event temporally related to the onset of amenorrhea. MMPI profiles showed high levels in all scales of 'Neurotic area' and a reduction in the correction (K) and masculinity-femininity (Mf) scales in the group with a life event. With the neuroendocrine approach 87. 5 % of these patients showed hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with poor or absent LH pulsatility. The MMPI profile of these patients was similar to that described above with insecurity, anxiety conversion trait, hypochondria, depression, emotional lability and <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> <b>adaptation</b> to distress. This study indicated that in amenorrheic patients characterized by a life event concomitant to the onset of the menstrual disorder, a particular personality trait of the neurotic type could be demonstrated and may indicate an inadequate reaction to stress...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to analyze the effect of {{non-tariff}} measures, specifically the Sanitary and Phytosanitary - SPS and Technical Barriers to Trade - TBT, on brazilian exports of tobacco and if this effect remained in the periods following the issuance of notifications. For that a gravity model was estimated using a sample of 89 importer’s brazilian tobacco between 1997 to 2011. The method used in the estimation of equations was the model Poisson-Pseudo Maximum Likehood (PPML). The results show that the sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS) affect the international flow of trade in tobacco negatively. Furthermore, was verified that this effect persisted during the periods after the issuance notification, and exporting companies can take up to 2 years to adjust the requirements set. Among the objectives of SPS notifications, most are related to measures for the protection of human health and protection of the plant, which may explain the greater <b>difficulty</b> <b>of</b> <b>adaptation,</b> since they are requirements that require large investments. The technical measures (TBT) were not statically significant, confirming a non-tariff such notifications on international trade in tobacco. Although most of the notifications to tobacco are associated with technical measures, the results indicated that they have not configured as barriers to trade in tobacco. This may suggest that the requirements referred to them, which was mostly related to labeling and / or packaging, were attended by Brazil without difficulty. Thus, it becomes important to include questions concerning the regulation of these measures in the discussions and decision-making processes of companies exporting tobacco. In terms of government actions, it would be interesting to establishment or enhancement of policies to increase the informative character of health measures, particularly those involving issues related to human health and plant protection, in order to reduce the time that exporters use to conform to such requirements...|$|E

In the discontinuous-flux case, non-uniqueness of mathematically consistent admissibility criteria results in infinitely many different notions of solution. A way to describe all the resulting L 1 -contractive solvers within a unified approach was proposed in the work [Andreianov, Karlsen, Risebro, 2011]. We briefly recall the ideas and re-sults developed there for the model one-dimensional case with f(t, x; u) = f_l (u) 1 _{x 0 } and highlight the main hints needed to address the multi-dimensional situation with curved interfaces. Then we discuss two recent developments in the subject which permit {{to better understand the}} issue of admissibility of solutions in relation with specific modeling assumptions; they also bring useful numerical approximation strategies. A new characterization of limits of vanishing viscosity approxi-mation proposed in [Andreianov and Mitrovic, 2014] permits to encode admissibility in singular but intuitively appealing entropy inequalities. Transmission maps introduced in ([Andreianov andCan es, 2014]) have applications in modeling flows in strongly heterogeneous porous media and lead to a simple algorithm for numerical approximation of the associated solutions. Moreover, in order to embed all the aforementioned results into a natural framework, we put forward the concept of interface coupling conditions (ICC) which role is analogous to the role of boundary conditions for boundary-value problems.

This paper tries to shed light to these questions and to identify the main sources which drove economic growth in the three countries. Our evidence shows that differences in productivity levels, capital accumulation in human resources and technology, foreign direct investment and most of all export capacity are the main factors explaining differences in economic performance between these three countries.

40|$|Knowledge {{acquisition}} is a {{well known}} bottleneck activity {{in the development of}} knowledge-based systems. The model-driven approach to knowledge acquisition is to use a library of generic problem solving methods, where each one is specialized for a certain kind of application task, such as diagnosis or product configuration, that guides knowledge acquisition in that kind of application. The thesis describes three case-studies of using the model-driven approach to knowledge acquisition, in particular within the CommonKADS methodology, and contributions motivated by the results of those case-studies. An important difficulty in model-driven knowledge acquisition is that a generic problem solving method often has to be adapted to the features of the current application. A widely accepted proposal for dealing with this difficulty, and others, is to organize libraries as hierarchical collections of task decomposition methods, rather than as collections of complete problem solving methods. Although such libraries reduce the need for adaptations, the case-studies show that adaptation is still a major difficulty. Two complementary approaches for further reducing the <b>difficulties</b> <b>of</b> <b>adaptation</b> are pursued. To support adaptation, general guidelines are provided for the process of adapting a selected generic problem solving method to the features of the current application. The guidelines are tested in two of the case-studies.

The principles are evaluated by showing that most of the modifications that were necessary in one of the case-studies could have been prevented by applying thes [...] ...|$|R

Social support was provided through organizations that included Americans aided integration and the families resettled before as they provided significant support is directing resettlement. Banki’s (2004) and Jacobsen’s (2001) indicators of refugee integration were used to in order to determine to the extent to which this sample of Bosnian refugees are integrated into their host county...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} teachers’ attitudes regarding the development of socio-emotional skills of students in primary general schools and the implementation of programs concerning the development of these skills within the school context. Socio-emotional skills are of particular importance in children's lives, as they help to develop appropriate codes of behavior, which would allow them to survive in the contemporary demands of society. Students should be able to communicate in acceptable ways, both with their peers and with other members of their family and society. An important contributor to the development of socio-emotional skills is the teacher (Elias & Arnold, 2006). The contemporary teacher must be thoroughly informed about techniques and approaches that should be followed to develop and strengthen the cultivation of these skills to all students and particularly to those who experience <b>difficulties</b> <b>of</b> social <b>adaptation</b> and show disruptive behavioral disorders...|$|R
40|$|International {{audience}} One of {{the things}} that teachers at the university level have to learn by experience is how to adapt their lectures and classroom activities depending on their intended audience. For instance, it is understood that teaching mathematics to mathematicians is different than teaching them to pre-service elementary school teachers. However, how to carry out this adaptation or what exactly should be changed is not often discussed. On the basis of my personal experience in the matter, here we use the Atherton model for reflecting about my own practice trying to extract some conclusions about the <b>difficulties</b> <b>of</b> the above-mentioned <b>adaptation.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographyThe greater {{openness}} {{to the outside world}} exhibited today by rural, peasant and indigenous groups is particularly notable among the young people in those populations, whose behavioural patterns, referents and expectations differ from those of preceding generations. At the same time, living conditions in the farming sector have improved very little, and agricultural producers' self-images have worsened; both of these factors prompt young people to leave the sector. Today, only half the people born in rural areas in the 1960 s still live there. Not enough attention has been devoted to this situation, which leads, among other things, to the types of problems associated with lack <b>of</b> preparation and <b>difficulties</b> <b>of</b> <b>adaptation</b> on the part of migrants. In those areas from which emigration is the heaviest, the ageing of the population is quite marked; this hampers any attempt to pursue a dynamic form of development and in some cases even leads to the dismantling of existing infrastructure and services (and, hence, an even greater loss of population);. Those young people who do wish to remain in rural areas have not received sufficient attention either. In order to utilize the potential they represent, this segment of the population needs {{to be taken into account}} by policy makers and has to be provided with channels for active participation in production activities and community affairs -not so that they may attain what their parents achieved, but rather so that they may take a substantive leap forward in terms of both their income and quality of life. It is also necessary to eliminate the many market imperfections existing in the rural sector and to enable each individual agricultural unit to approach its optimal production frontier...|$|R
40|$|The article {{considers}} methodological {{and empirical}} aspects of cross-cultural communica-tions under {{the economic and}} cultural globalization that determined the free movement of labor migrants around the world though this process is accompanied by certain difficulties. The authors believe that even a theoretically prepared person that knows {{about the influence of}} cultural differences on the organizational management in different countries will experience a cultural shock when working abroad. The cultural shock is a discomfort, frustration and even depression caused by getting into an unfamiliar environment. At the applied level, the authors analyze the so-called ‘cross-cultural experiments’ - attempts of an individual (a working specialist of a certain nation) to test one’s strength, skills, and professional competencies in a foreign company. The authors’ sociological study of a cultural benchmarking type consisted of two stages. At the first stage, foreigners working in the capital of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) were inter-viewed; at the second stage, the Russians working abroad, mainly in the USA, were interviewed. The migra-tion flows from China have recently intensified in Yakutia, but the overwhelming majority of labor migrants are still from West and Central Asia, mainly from Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Armenia. The foreigners working in Yakutia and Russians working abroad experience same <b>difficulties</b> <b>of</b> <b>adaptation</b> in a new col-lective. Friends, relatives, members of the ethnic community, but not specially trained cross-cultural coaches and mentors, help them with adaptation. Such a personnel technology as selection, recruitment and headhunt-ing works reasonably well, while other HR technologies of cross-cultural management (motivation, feedback, etc.) are still lagging behind. The authors insist on introducing courses on cross-cultural adaptation in interna-tional groups both in Russia and abroad together with a system of the so-called ‘budding’...|$|R
