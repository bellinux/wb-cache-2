Here, we compared the utility of burrowing behavior with hypersensitivity to applied mechanical stimuli for pain assessment in rat models of chronic inflammatory and peripheral neuropathic pain. Briefly, groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats were habituated to the burrowing environment and trained over a 5 -day period. Rats that burrowed ≤ 450 g of gravel on any two days of the individual training phase were excluded from the study. The remaining rats received either a unilateral intraplantar injection of Freund’s complete adjuvant (FCA) or saline, or underwent unilateral chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve- or sham-surgery. Baseline burrowing behavior and evoked pain behaviors were assessed prior to model induction, and twice-weekly until study completion on day 14. For FCA- and CCI-rats, but not the corresponding groups of sham-rats, evoked mechanical hypersensitivity developed in a temporal manner in the ipsilateral hindpaws. Although burrowing behavior also decreased in a temporal manner for both FCA- and CCI-rats, there was considerable <b>inter-animal</b> <b>variability.</b> By contrast, mechanical hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia in the ipsilateral hindpaws of FCA- and CCI-rats respectively, exhibited minimal <b>inter-animal</b> <b>variability.</b> Our data collectively show that burrowing behavior is altered in rodent models of chronic inflammatory pain and peripheral neuropathic pain.

Large <b>inter-animal</b> in concentration <b>variability</b> of IVM in both matrices was observed.

The mean time in which IVM concentrations fell below the limit of detection for the whole ewe group was 22 and 23 days for plasma and milk, respectively. Time course of IVM concentration in milk was following the time course of IVM concentration in plasma, with an overall mean±S.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Transgenic mice expressing mutated amyloid {{precursor}} protein (APP) and presenilin (PS) - 1 or - 2 have been successfully used to model cerebral beta-amyloidosis, one of the characteristic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. However, the use of many transgenic lines is limited by premature death, low breeding efficiencies and late onset and high <b>inter-animal</b> <b>variability</b> of the pathology, creating a need for improved animal models. Here we describe the detailed characterization of a new homozygous double-transgenic mouse line that addresses most of these issues. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The transgenic mouse line (ARTE 10) was generated by co-integration of two transgenes carrying the K 670 N/M 671 L mutated amyloid {{precursor protein}} (APP(swe)) and the M 146 V mutated presenilin 1 (PS 1) both under control of a neuron-specific promoter. Mice, hemi- as well as homozygous for both transgenes, are viable and fertile with good breeding capabilities and a low rate of premature death. They develop robust AD-like cerebral beta-amyloid plaque pathology with glial inflammation, signs of neuritic dystrophy and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Using our novel image analysis algorithm for semi-automatic quantification of plaque burden, we demonstrate an early onset and progressive plaque deposition starting at 3 months of age in homozygous mice with low <b>inter-animal</b> <b>variability</b> and 100 %-penetrance of the phenotype. The plaques are readily detected in vivo by PiB, the standard human PET tracer for AD. In addition, ARTE 10 mice display early loss of synaptic markers and age-related cognitive deficits. By applying a gamma-secretase inhibitor we show a dose dependent reduction of soluble amyloid beta levels in the brain. CONCLUSIONS: ARTE 10 mice develop a cerebral beta-amyloidosis closely resembling the beta-amyloid-related aspects of human AD neuropathology. Unifying several advantages of previous transgenic models, this line particularly qualifies for the use in target validation and for evaluating potential diagnostic or therapeutic agents targeting the amyloid pathology of AD...|$|E

An accurate animal model {{of this disease}} is crucial for elucidation of the underlying natural history of the illness and also for testing experimental therapeutics. We established a new yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) mouse model of HD with the entire human HD gene containing 128 CAG repeats (YAC 128) which develops motor abnormalities and age-dependent brain atrophy including cortical and striatal atrophy associated with striatal neuronal loss. YAC 128 mice exhibit initial hyperactivity, followed by the onset of a motor deficit and finally hypokinesis. The motor deficit in the YAC 128 mice is highly correlated with striatal neuronal loss, providing a structural correlate for the behavioral changes.

A repetition using CX 3 CR 1 -GFP mice cohort showed similar results. Our histological findings suggest that there is no significant impact of acute delivery of PEG on the FBR in the long-term, and that temporary increase in the device footprint due to the coating of PEG also does not have a significant impact.

To further explore the mechanism of action of antidepressants, the effect of 21 -day drug treatment to rats on serotonin type 2 and beta-adrenergic receptors in fronto-parietal hemicortices was evaluated. Because the same brain was used to measure concomitant changes in both receptors, confounding effects due to <b>inter-animal</b> <b>variability</b> are reduced. The effect of a classical antidepressant drug, desmethylimipramine, was compared with two compounds which have more recently been used to treat depression, ie., adinazolam, a tirazolobenzodiazepine, and buspirone, a serotonin type 1 A partial agonist, both of which possesses combined anxiolytic and antidepressant effects.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Colorectal-cancer (CRC) {{research}} has greatly {{benefited from the}} availability of small animal tumor models. Spontaneous and chemically-induced CRC models are widely used yet limited in their resemblance to human disease and are often prolonged, not accurately repetitive, and associated with inflammatory side effects. In-situ murine or human tumor implantation in the gastrointestinal tract of mice is extremely challenging, and limited by <b>inter-animal</b> <b>variability</b> and procedure-related complications and mortality. As a result, in frequent studies CRC is implanted in distal sites, most commonly the subcutaneous region, an approach that is greatly limited {{by the absence of}} normal gastrointestinal tumor milieu and has substantial effects on tumor development. AIMS: In this study we aimed to develop a well-tolerated repetitive tool to study CRC in small animals by adapting the murine colonoscopy system to serve as a platform for colonic sub-mucosal orthotopic implantation of human and murine CRC tumor cells. RESULTS: We report the establishment of a novel small-animal CRC model that is minimally invasive, rapid, well-tolerated, highly reproducible, and confers precise control of tumor number, location and growth rate. Moreover, we show that this model uniquely allows the side-by-side induction of distinct genetically manipulated tumors, enabling the mechanistic study of tumor interaction and cross-talk within the native intestinal microenvironment.

A 16 S rRNA metagenomic approach and Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology were used to investigate the bacterial microbiome composition in the liquid fraction of the rumen content collected via stomach tubing. To investigate biodiversity, samples were taken from three groups of four lactating dairy cows given a supplement of either 50 g of potato protein (Ctrl group), or 50 g of lyophilized Saccharomyces cerevisiae (LY group) or 50 g of dried S. cerevisiae (DY group) in a potato protein support. Rumen samples were collected after 15 days of dietary treatments and milk production was similar between the three groups. Taxonomic distribution analysis revealed a prevalence of the Firmicutes phylum in all cows (79. 76 %) and a significantly (P< 0. 05) higher presence of the genus Bacillus in the DY group. Volatile fatty-acid concentration was not significantly different between groups, possibly because of relatively high <b>inter-animal</b> <b>variability</b> or limited effect of the treatments or both, and the correlation analysis with bacterial taxa showed significant associations, in particular between many Firmicutes genera and butyrate.

The overestimation of quantitative values due to contrast media, which never exceeded 10 % in our study, could be a source of <b>inter-animal</b> <b>variability,</b> previously demonstrated to be 15 % on average in mice-bearing tumors imaged twice on the same day, after injection and reinjection of 18 F-FDG [28], 18 F-FLT [29], or 18 F-labeled RGD [30]. Another implication of the use of contrast media is the possible interaction between intraperitoneal contrast media and chemotherapy, molecularly targeted therapies, or vehicle administered intraperitoneally the day of the PET examination. Although the peritoneum is known to allow fast absorption of fluids, further studies are required to investigate the delay required to reach full absorption of intraperitoneal contrast media, as well as potential renal toxicity of repeated intraperitoneal injections, having in mind that some antineoplastic treatments induce kidney damage. The morbidity that could arise from long-lasting agents and that relates to viscosity, volume, and iodine content will also be the topic of a future work.|$|E

Marked <b>inter-animal</b> <b>variability</b> in central nervous system (CNS) toxicity was identified following administration of a high dose of INH, which enabled characterization of CNS responders and CNS non-responders. High-resolution post-dose urinary (1) H NMR spectra were modeled both by their xenobiotic and endogenous metabolic information sets, enabling simultaneous identification of the differential metabolic fate of INH and its associated endogenous metabolic consequences in CNS responders and CNS non-responders. A characteristic xenobiotic metabolic profile was observed for CNS responders, which revealed higher urinary levels of pyruvate isonicotinylhydrazone and β-glucosyl isonicotinylhydrazide {{and lower levels of}} acetylisoniazid compared to CNS non-responders. This suggested that the capacity for acetylation of INH was lower in CNS responders, leading to increased metabolism via conjugation with pyruvate and glucose. In addition, the endogenous metabolic profile of CNS responders revealed higher urinary levels of lactate and glucose, in comparison to CNS non-responders. Pharmacometabonomic analysis of the pre-dose (1) H NMR urinary spectra identified a metabolic signature that correlated with the development of INH-induced adverse CNS effects and may represent a means of predicting adverse events and acetylation capacity when challenged with high dose INH. Given the widespread use of INH for the treatment of tuberculosis, this pharmacometabonomic screening approach may have translational potential for patient stratification to minimize adverse events...|$|E
40|$|Sub-cellular {{biomarkers}} {{provide a}} sensitive tool in environmental monitoring {{as they are}} able to detect environmental perturbations at an early stage before a whole animal, physiological or community response becomes manifested. A sub-cellular biomarker for the detection of estuarine sediment contamination by a in vitro staining method, employing the weak base, neutral red, was developed for use with the euryhaline endobenthic polychaete Nereis diversicolor, O. F. Müller. Coelomocytes extracted from the coelomic cavity of rag worms from different sites into a physiological saline were allowed to adhere to a microscope slide before administration of neutral red dye. As a result of its weak alkaline and cationic character the dye was readily taken up and retained by lysosomes. Observation of dye leakage from lysosomes to the cytosol has permitted the quantification of the degree of lysosomal membrane pathology caused by increased sequestration of pollutants or natural induced stress. The assay enabled the detection of site specific differences: Rag worms from Aveton Gifford had the lowest neutral red retention times as a result of low salinity at that site. Animals from the moderately contaminated site St. Johns Lake and the grossly heavy metal polluted site, Restronguet Creek had similar NRR times. Nereis from the secluded Erme estuary were in the healthiest state. In vitro exposures of coelomocytes to different copper concentrations did not reveal a dose response relationship, possibly because the concentrations used lay below a threshold level and because the <b>inter-animal</b> <b>variability</b> was very high...|$|E

As HCMV pp 65 elicits protective immune responses in infected humans and represents an important vaccination target, one RhCMV homologue of HCMV pp 65, pp 65 - 2 (Rh 112), was characterized and analysed {{for its ability to}} induce host immune responses. Similar to its HCMV counterpart, RhCMV pp 65 - 2 was expressed as a late gene, localized to the nucleus within pp 65 - 2 -expressing cells and was present within infectious virions. Longitudinal and cross-sectional studies of pp 65 - 2 immunity in naturally infected rhesus macaques; showed that humoral responses to pp 65 - 2 were elicited early during infection, but were not always sustained over time. In contrast, pp 65 - 2 -specific T-cell responses, examined by gamma interferon ELISPOT, were broadly detectable in all of the animals studied during primary infection and persisted {{in the vast majority of}} RhCMV-seropositive monkeys. Moreover, there was considerable <b>inter-animal</b> <b>variability</b> in the pattern of the immune responses to pp 65 - 2. Together, these results demonstrated that RhCMV pp 65 - 2 exhibited biological and immunological homology to HCMV pp 65. Thus, the rhesus macaque model of HCMV persistence and pathogenesis should be relevant for addressing pp 65 -based vaccine modalities...|$|E

CYN {{has been responsible}} for both livestock and human poisoning after oral exposure. This study investigated the toxicity of CYN to pregnant mice exposed during different segments of gestation. The course of recovery and individual responses to the toxin were evaluated. Adverse effects of CYN were monitored up to 7 weeks post-dosing by clinical examination, histopathology, biochemistry and gene expression. Exposure on gestational days (GD) 8 – 12 induced significantly more lethality than GD 13 – 17 exposure. Periorbital, gastrointestinal and distal tail hemorrhages were seen in both groups. Serum markers indicative of hepatic injury (alanine amino transferase, aspartate amino transferase and sorbitol dehydrogenase) were increased in both groups; markers of renal dysfunction (blood urea nitrogen and creatinine) were elevated in the GD 8 – 12 animals. Histopathology was observed in the liver (centrilobular necrosis) and kidney (interstitial inflammation) in groups exhibiting abnormal serum markers. The expression profiles of genes involved in ribosomal biogenesis, xenobiotic and lipid metabolism, inflammatory response and oxidative stress were altered 24 h after the final dose. One week after dosing, gross, histological and serum parameters had returned to normal, although increased liver/body weight ratio and one instance of gastrointestinal bleeding was found in the GD 13 – 17 group. Gene expression changes persisted up to 2 weeks post-dosing and returned to normal by 4 weeks. Responses of individual animals to CYN exposure indicated highly significant <b>inter-animal</b> <b>variability</b> within the treated groups...|$|E
40|$|Therapeutic {{resistance}} {{continues to}} be a persistent challenge in medical oncology. In clinical settings, resistance can occur at the beginning of treatment, or may be acquired after an initial clinical response to the therapy. Several mechanisms of drug resistance have been described in cancer, including alterations in the drug transport and metabolism process, mutations in drug-target, activation of bypass signaling pathways, inhibition of cell-death pathways, and induction of an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in response to cytotoxic or targeted therapies. In this study, I have investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying ZEB 1 -induced EMT and established a new computational framework that uses inter-animal heterogeneity to identify drivers responsible for variable phenotypic responses across different animals. EMT describes a cell-state switching process wherein epithelial cells lose their tight cell-cell junction contacts, and acquire the ability to migrate and invade the surrounding stroma to enter into blood circulation. Given the widespread role of EMT in drug resistance, it is imperative to identify therapeutic strategies to inhibit this transition. To identify druggable targets to block EMT progression, and therefore overcome EMT-mediated therapeutic resistance, I studied the effects of ZEB 1 expression on cellular signaling networks. By quantifying changes in tyrosine phosphorylation at different time points during ZEB 1 -induced EMT, I found that Src family kinases (SFKs) were activated within 24 hours of ZEB 1 expression. Inhibition of SFKs blocked not only ZEB 1 -induced EMT, but also EMT initiated by TGFp- and EGF signaling pathways in both breast and NSCLC cell-lines. SFK inhibition also prevented EGFR inhibitor-induced EMT and drug resistance in NSCLC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, SFK activation stabilized ZEBI by promoting ERK 1 / 2 -mediated phosphorylation on three serine residues, S 583, S 646, and S 679. Consequently, MEK inhibition phenocopied the effects of blocking SFK activity with regards to decreasing stability of ZEB 1 and inhibiting ZEB 1 -induced EMT. These results provide a new therapeutic application of SFK inhibitors as a potential anti-EMT therapy, to enhance the susceptibility of cancer cells to chemo- or targeted therapies. In the second part of this thesis, I have described a computational framework that leverages inter-animal heterogeneity to identify molecular mechanisms underlying variable phenotypic responses across different animals. Substantial <b>inter-animal</b> <b>variability</b> in phenotypes within the same treatment group, limits our ability to draw conclusions or gain meaningful insights about a biological process by simply averaging the data. To identify molecular drivers for heterogeneous phenotypic responses, I have established a method where each animal is considered as an individual entity whose phenotypic response is dependent on the state of its underlying signaling networks. As a proof of concept, I have used this method to successfully predict the resistance mechanisms of CDK 4 / 6 inhibitor, palbocilib in two GBM PDX and one MPNST PDX models. The GBM 6 model activated EGFR signaling upon treatment with palbociclib whereas the GBM 22 and MPNST 3 models activated SFKs and PDGFRa signaling in resistant tumors. Across all three PDX tumor models, treatment with combination therapies, consisting of palbociclib and an inhibitor targeting the activated bypass signaling pathway, substantially prolonged survival of mice. Thus, these results suggest that <b>inter-animal</b> <b>variability</b> {{can be used as a}} tool to predict drivers for a specific phenotypic response across different treatment conditions. by Vibhuti Agrawal.

40|$|Most {{experimental}} stroke {{research is}} carried out in rodents, but given differences between rodents and human, nonhuman primate (NHP) models may provide a valuable tool to study therapeutic interventions. The authors developed a surgical method for transient occlusion of the M 1 branch of middle cerebral artery (MCA) in the African green monkey to evaluate safety aspects of intravenous infusion of mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) derived from human bone marrow. The left Sylvian fissure was exposed by a small fronto-temporal craniotomy. The M 1 branch of the MCA was exposed by microsurgical dissection and clipped for 2 to 4 hours. Neurological examinations and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were carried out at regular post-operative course. hMSCs were infused 1 hour after reperfusion (clip release) in the 3 -hour occlusion model. During M 1 occlusion, two patterns of changes were observed in the lateral hemisphere surface. One pattern (Pattern 1) was darkening of venous blood, small vessel collapse, and blood pooling with no venous return in cortical veins. Animals with these three features had severe and lasting hemiplegia and MRI demonstrated extensive MCA territory infarction. Animals in the second pattern (Pattern 2) displayed darkening of venous blood, small vessel collapse, and reduced but incompletely occluded venous flow and the functional deficit was much less severe and MRI indicated smaller infarction areas in brain. The severe group (Pattern 1) likely had less extensive collateral circulation than the less severe group (Pattern 2) where venous pooling of blood was not observed. The hMSC infused animals showed a trend for greater functional improvement that {{was not statistically significant}} in the acute phase and no additive negative effects. These results indicate <b>inter-animal</b> <b>variability</b> of collateral circulation after complete M 1 occlusion and that hMSC infusion is safe in the developed NHP stroke model...|$|E
40|$|Lung {{cancer has}} the highest {{mortality}} rate of any tissue-specific cancer in both men and women. Research continues to investigate novel drugs and therapies to mitigate poor treatment efficacy, {{but the lack of}} a good descriptive lung cancer animal model for preclinical drug evaluation remains an obstacle. Here we describe the development of an orthotopic lung cancer animal model which utilizes the human sodium iodide symporter gene (hNIS; SLC 5 A 5) as an imaging reporter gene for the purpose of non-invasive, longitudinal tumor quantification. hNIS is a glycoprotein that naturally transports iodide (I-) into thyroid cells and has the ability to symport the radiotracer 99 mTc-pertechnetate (99 mTcO 4 -). A 549 lung adenocarcinoma cells were genetically modified with plasmid or lentiviral vectors to express hNIS. Modified cells were implanted into athymic nude mice to develop two tumor models: a subcutaneous and an orthotopic xenograft tumor model. Tumor progression was longitudinally imaged using SPECT/CT and quantified by SPECT voxel analysis. hNIS expression in lung tumors was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. Additionally, hematoxylin and eosin staining and visual inspection of pulmonary tumors was performed. We observed that lentiviral transduction provided enhanced and stable hNIS expression in A 549 cells. Furthermore, 99 mTcO 4 - uptake and accumulation was observed within lung tumors allowing for imaging and quantification of tumor mass at two-time points. This study illustrates the development of an orthotopic lung cancer model that can be longitudinally imaged throughout the experimental timeline thus avoiding <b>inter-animal</b> <b>variability</b> and leading to a reduction in total animal numbers. Furthermore, our orthotopic lung cancer animal model is clinically relevant and the genetic modification of cells for SPECT/CT imaging can be translated to other tissue-specific tumor animal models...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus) {{has been}} used {{extensively}} {{as a model of}} forebrain ischemia. Its unique susceptibility to ischemia was suggested to be due to an incomplete circle of Willis. The relative ease to which ischemia can be induced combined with highly reproducible delayed CA 1 cell death following a 5 -min occlusion made the model popular in neuroprotection studies. Presently, this assumption was tested that complete forebrain ischemia occurs in all gerbils because increased variability was noticed in neuronal injury and behavioral outcome using this model in the last several years. Here it is reported that gerbils obtained from Charles River, the largest supplier in North America, show a high incidence (22. 7 % with bilateral and 38. 6 % with unilateral anastomoses) of posterior communicating arteries compared to another supplier of gerbils (High Oak Farms, 2. 6 % with bilateral and 13. 2 % with unilateral anastomoses, P< 0. 0001). This increased incidence of complete or partial circle of Willis led to less severe CA 1 cell loss in Charles River gerbils (P< 0. 0001) compared to High Oak gerbils, with an unacceptably high level of <b>inter-animal</b> <b>variability.</b> Similarly, behavioral indices of CA 1 ischemic injury (increased locomotion, habituation deficits) were also significantly attenuated in the Charles River animals. High Oak gerbils also displayed increased histological and behavioral variability relative to the pattern obtained several years ago. Thus, the gerbil model of forebrain ischemia, at least using Charles River animals, no longer produces consistent injury and behavioral alterations. Investigators are urged to consider adopting other models in future neuroprotection studies or ensure that their gerbil population lacks communicating arteries.

To evaluate the different sources of variation in mRNA gene expression profiles, gene expression profiles were monitored using the Affymetrix RatTox U 34 arrays in cultured primary hepatocytes derived from six rats over a 26 hour period at 6 time points (0 h, 2 h, 5 h, 8 h, 14 h and 26 h) with two replicate arrays {{at each time point}} for each animal. In addition, the impact of sample size on the variability of differentially expressed gene lists and the consistency of biological responses were also investigated. Excellent intra-animal reproducibility was obtained at all time points with 0 out of 370 present probe sets across all time points showing significant difference between the 2 replicate arrays (3 -way ANOVA, p ≤ 0. 0001). However, large inter-animal biological variation in mRNA expression profiles was observed with 337 out of 370 present probe sets showing significant differences among 6 animals (3 -way ANOVA, p ≤ 0. 05). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) revealed that time effect (PC 1) in this data set accounted for 47. 4 % of total variance indicating the dynamics of transcriptomics. The second and third largest effects came from animal difference, which accounted for 16. 9 % (PC 2 and PC 3) of the total variance. The reproducibility of gene lists and their functional classification was declined considerably when the sample size was decreased. Overall, our results strongly support that there is significant <b>inter-animal</b> <b>variability</b> in the time-course gene expression profiles, which is a confounding factor that must be carefully evaluated to correctly interpret microarray gene expression studies. The consistency of the gene lists and their biological functional classification are also sensitive to sample size with the reproducibility decreasing considerably under small sample size...|$|E
40|$|Cytochrome P 450 enzymes (CYPs) are {{of great}} {{interest}} to pharmaceutical industry due to their major role in drug metabolism and drug-drug interactions in man. As CYPs also act on endogenous substrates and are regulated by nuclear receptors involved in biochemical pathways, their profiles are likely to affect endogenous metabolic profiles. The work in this thesis aimed to establish baseline rat liver CYP levels and assess relationships between CYP profiles and corresponding endogenous metabolic profiles, before introducing CYP inducers in subsequent projects to identify early biomarkers of CYP induction. An efficient and reproducible protocol was first developed and optimised for liver untargeted metabolic profiling by ultra performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). Comparison of technical and biological variation for this liver protocol then demonstrated that sample preparation and UPLC-MS variability was mostly small compared to <b>inter-animal</b> <b>variability.</b> Subsequently, an in vivo study was designed including 20 male and 20 female Wistar rats. Liver mRNA of 81 CYPs was quantified, of which 23 exhibited significant gender differences with a gender ratio > 2. Clear gender differences were also observed in serum, urine and liver UPLC-MS metabolic profiles, e. g for metabolites belonging to steroid, triglyceride and phospholipid families. Multivariate models constructed to investigate relationships between CYP and metabolic profiles mainly highlighted the latent variable “gender”. Separate investigations for each gender yielded good prediction of CYP mRNA profiles from male liver aqueous metabolic profiles and female urine metabolic profiles. For prediction of CYP activities, the best models were obtained from serum metabolic profiles. In conclusion, this work improved our knowledge of rat basal CYP and metabolic profiles, and provides a strong basis for subsequent studies on CYP inducers. Importantly, strategies developed for UPLC-MS sample preparation, study design and data pre-processing/analysis are now routinely employed in our laboratory and have applications in many metabolic profiling studies.
