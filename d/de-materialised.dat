50|$|Although India had {{a vibrant}} capital market {{which is more}} than a century old, the paper-based {{settlement}} of trades caused substantial problems such as bad delivery and delayed transfer of title. The enactment of Depositories Act in August 1996 paved the way for establishment of National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL), the first depository in India. It went on to establish infrastructure based on international standards that handles most of the securities held and settled in <b>de-materialised</b> form in the Indian capital markets.|$|E
5000|$|John {{additionally}} {{describes the}} presence of a soudarion, for the head, that was set apart. A soudarion is literally a sweat rag; more specifically it was a piece of cloth used to wipe away sweat, but in the context of dead bodies, most scholars believe it was used to keep the jaw closed. Tradition holds that the Sudarion was a turban, and that it later found its way to Oviedo in Spain, becoming the Sudarium of Oviedo. Although it may initially seem insignificant, the fact that the item for the head was set apart fundamentally affects Christology. If the head cloth remained in the same location as the remainder of the clothes, and if these remained where the body had been, it implies that Jesus' body was lifted through the clothing, or that Jesus' body <b>de-materialised</b> and re-materialised elsewhere, hence supporting more docetic interpretations. Conversely, it being set apart implies the opposite—that someone took the clothes off in an ordinary manner. Furthermore, the Greek text uses the word entetuligmenon, translated [...] "having been folded up", seeming to imply some intentional action had been taken on the soudarion. Some see this as a direct attack by the author of John on docetism, and the gnosticism that used the synoptic accounts to advocate it.|$|E
40|$|Transport {{has long}} been {{considered}} central to urban and regional development, and {{to the concept of}} economic growth in general. The establishment of trade routes is an essential prerequisite for the expansion of market ranges. And as settlements grow, an efficient internal organisation of infrastructures is key to facilitate the efficient movements of people and goods. Distance and density remain the two most fundamental concepts in urban development theory. But of course today’s cities and regions are vastly different from the places we used to live in as little as fifty years ago and consequently the relationship between transport infrastructures and economic development has been dramatically redefined over the last half century. As we have moved from Fordist to post-Fordist and post-industrial production and consumption structures, wealth creation as a whole has become an increasingly complex and <b>de-materialised</b> concept. Successful modern economies are less and less based on heavy production industries dependent on large-scale flow of material goods an...|$|E
50|$|The {{artist is}} {{concerned}} with the interaction of colour and can be situated in the tradition of colour field painting. She paints using highly diluted acrylic paints on wooden panels (panel paintings). These works consist of many paint layers that are glaze painted in a lengthy process with a broad brush. Since 1999, she also creates large format colour field compositions directly on interior walls. Her mural paintings focus in particular on the spatial effect of the colours thereby the colour fields create a deep dialogue with the architecture and <b>de-materialise</b> the space.|$|R
40|$|Theory as art practice“ is {{a two-part}} set of notes {{outlining}} {{the position that}} research in contemporary visual art practice is constituted as much by word by text as it is by image, as much by what {{can be said about}} it as by what one sees, and that what one sees is in any case already written. Or in other words, and simply put, {{there is no such thing}} as a pure image, as pure practice, as image which is not always already written or practice which is not always already theorised. Indeed more than this, to the extent that artworks can show something about theory that the theory in question is blind to. The word in the form of discourses on art and the writing that visual art is, are no less than conditions of possibility of seeing. Part I focuses on what is written in the visible. Part II addresses how words <b>de-materialise,</b> de-representationalise and de-figure the visible. The coda is text as image claiming a theoretical position, provoking artists to say otherwise, or to the contrary prove what is said there, either way in the form of visual artworks...|$|R
40|$|This paper examines, {{from the}} {{perspective}} of a critically engaged practioner within the context of contemporary fine art printmaking practice, the concept of a “digital matrix” and the consequent “paperless print”. It identifies that “digital printmaking” is a definition that can encompass both material and non-material manifestations of the fine art print when set against developments in presentation technologies and subsequent increased demands from the digital cultural consumer. The implications of de-materialisation and subsequent shifts of the print art object from the physical to temporal are considered in the light of the challenges they present. The inherent implications for the practioner and their perception of practice are examined in the light of the printmaker / artist now having access to new forms of expression which no longer rely on physicality. The paper further suggests that the adopted mechanisms of establishing and maintaining “authenticity” of the <b>de-materialised</b> print art object must be commensurate with the complexities of digital practice; collaboration, partnership, duplication, authenticity and interpretation, and are evolved from ethical considerations of conduct, and the spirit of “creative commons” which are perhaps more akin to musical and performance arts than traditional visual art.

40|$|Already in the mid- 1960 s, {{with the}} first {{warnings}} of juvenile arraignments, an open critique of the naive enthusiasm with which the former generation had absorbed the myth of technology and communication came to the fore. So that Archigram members themselves, in proposing a cardboard megastructure for the ARCHIGRAM VII special issue (‘everybody's got their own mega-structure, do it yourself’ they wrote), kept an ironic distance from the modernistic belief in the linear evolution of society (Fig. 1). Nevertheless, the dramatic decrease in the utopian mainstream that had characterised the ‘Year of Megastructures’, as Banham called it (1963), succeeded in producing an unrepeatable architectural gesture for the celebration of individual freedom and social equality. As {{one of the best-known}} contemporary icons, the Pompidou Centre was also responsible for turning the modernistic interest in functionality into the <b>de-materialised</b> aspects of urban fetishism. The hyper-objectification of its form and the consequent ‘transparency’ of its content led in fact to a new type of architectural fruition: that in which the ideological perception of the building exceeded the real possibilities suggested by its hyper-flexibility. Thus, the Pompidou also inaugurated a new era for the dogmatic myth of self-empowerment by means of self-learning (auto-didacticism) and mass jouissance...|$|E
40|$|The ‘Born Digital – New Materialities’ print {{portfolio}} {{is the result}} of a digitally mediated open call “exchange” survey, examining the notion of “printmaking 2. 0 ”. It is part of research examining the physical and temporal parameters of post-physical print making practice through the exploration and application of digital processes in making and cultural shifts in digital participation, being undertaken by the curator/researcher at Grays School of Art – Robert Gordon University. The research is founded on questions raised through the researcher’s professional activities, of printmaking practice and teaching activities in Contemporary Art Practice. Through this cumulative experience the researcher has become cogniscent of how the physical and temporal boundaries of the transferred image are being redefined by rapid developments in both the technical practice of digital process and more critically the shifts resulting from mass digital participation. With resulting questions concerning the very nature of digital printmaking in these terms and in respect to the physical & temporal boundaries of the digital print itself. The objective of this survey print exchange was to explore the practice of peer printmakers to detect markers of transition between traditional and new forms of printmaking. The survey also sought to examine notions of materiality set against these new concepts of electronic consumption for the printmaking 2. 0 object, where questions of allocation and signature have arisen within the electronic distribution of digitally mediated prints. Consequently questions of permanence, materiality, authenticity, authorisation and allocation set against a possible dialectic of physical and <b>de-materialised</b> practice were explored. In curating this exchange, social network platforms were used to coordinate, track and develop meaningful links with the artists. This portfolio represents a significant snapshot of the digitally mediated print works of 49 international print artists. Funding : The Estate of Mr & Mrs H. Thompso...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} is to {{understand}} how the influence of digital media has led to new ways of consuming and creating painting, enabling a new mode of representation. It is argued that a fundamental problem of contemporary art discourse is the exclusion of painting from most discussion of New Media, despite a multitude of shared conceptual and procedural approaches. The thesis first provides an overview of contemporary painting practice, presenting two dominant areas: ‘Provisional Painting’ and ‘Post-Internet Painting’. It is argued that both are insufficient to describe the complexities of painting in relation to the broader contemporary condition as influenced by digital media. The thesis then discusses fundamental aspects of digital technology, explaining how it has previously been used by artists. It is proposed that until recently the ‘digital translation’ was the dominant process in the utilisation of digital technology in painting, functioning to translate images between <b>de-materialised</b> and materialised form. It is also argued that artists are now engaging in a process termed the ‘digital transformation’; an action that moves beyond the digital translation as simply the intentioned alteration of image and object. The resulting alteration is termed the ‘visual artifact’. The ‘digital transaction’ is employed to describe the enacting of these processes between digital media and materialised forms, while ‘the Archive’ is used to describe the complete system of exchange through which these processes occur—incorporating the Internet and other forms of media. Five case studies of work undertaken during the research process demonstrate the process of creation and show how the aforementioned terms are applied. Finally, the thesis reflects on how this work demonstrates a new mode of painting—termed ‘New Representation’. The accompanying creative work presented for examination is a series of paintings presented at Chalk Horse Gallery in Sydney. Access is restricted to staff and students of the University of Sydney.
