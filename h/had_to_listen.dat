5|$|Martin oversaw {{post-production}} on The Beatles Anthology (which {{was originally}} entitled The Long and Winding Road) in 1994 and 1995, working again with Geoff Emerick. Martin {{decided to use}} an old 8-track analogue deck – which EMI learned an engineer still had – to mix the songs for the project, instead of a modern digital deck. He explained this {{by saying that the}} old deck created a completely different sound, which a new deck could not accurately reproduce. He also said he found the whole project a strange experience (and McCartney agreed), as they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> to themselves chatting in the studio, 25–30 years previously.|$|E
500|$|The {{post-production}} {{tasks were}} as challenging as the production itself. Sound editors <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> {{to the entire}} uncut tracks from the recorders taped to the actors' bodies {{in order to find}} the dialogue. Content proprietary to Disney, such as the lyrics to [...] "It's a Small World" [...] and footage from Soarin', was removed from the film to avoid copyright infringement. Composer Abel Korzeniowski contributed a light, airy score similar to those used in Hollywood's Golden Age.|$|E

I remember where I was when I heard it and called my manager, Ann, and I was like, 'Do not let anyone else have this song! It’s my song.' In talking to Chris and Josh about it, they , 'We said we're either writing a song for Carrie Underwood or this song {{is never going to}} see the light of day.' It made me feel so good that they were thinking of me when they wrote it." ...|$|E

500|$|Many reviewers {{appreciated}} the pointed [...] "I Don't Want to Know" [...] performance. Kubicek called it [...] "quite entertaining", Gonzalez felt the [...] "angry singing" [...] was [...] "hot" [...] {{and gave it}} an [...] "A−", the same grade as Benigno, who said the song had [...] "a bit more oomph than the original", though he added that Finn [...] "sings with the subtlety of an artillery barrage" [...] and he was happy with Quinn's [...] "strong foundation in the back". Futterman wrote that it was [...] "better than Quinn and Sam's 'Lucky, but Berk gave the song only two stars out of five, the same grade he gave to [...] "Go Your Own Way". Although both Kubicek and Gonzalez criticized Rachel's motivations in singing the song, the latter still gave it an [...] "A" [...] and noted [...] "if I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> to someone cover this song, it'd be her". Semigran called it [...] "one of Lea Michele's strongest outings all season", while Benigno said [...] "this {{is one of those}} rare times her balls-to-the-walls delivery works with the arrangement instead of distracting from it" [...] and gave it an [...] "A". Hankinson was [...] "particularly fond" [...] of the song, and added that it had [...] "great energy".|$|E

2500|$|Propertius himself says he {{was popular}} and even scandalous in his own day. [...] Horace, however, says {{that he would have}} to [...] "endure much" [...] and [...] "stop up his ears" [...] if he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> to [...] "Callimachus...to please the {{sensitive}} stock of poets"; Postgate and others see this as a veiled attack on Propertius, who considered himself the Roman heir to Callimachus. This judgement also seems to be upheld by Quintilian, who ranks the elegies of Tibullus higher and is somewhat dismissive of the poet, but Propertius' popularity is attested by the presence of his verses in the graffiti preserved at Pompeii.|$|E
2500|$|In his Peapatch Politics: The Earl Long Era in Louisiana Politics, Dodd {{noted with}} humor how Long became irritated with McCrory, {{who had been}} invited on Long's intraparty ticket [...] "to harass and, we hoped, defeat Uncle Earl's old {{political}} enemy, Dave Pearce. All McCrory could talk about was pesticides {{and how to get}} rid of different kinds of crop-killing bugs. His main topic and claim to fame, which dominated all of his speeches, whether he was in cotton country, forestry areas, or the city of New Orleans, was his eradicating the pink boll worms from Louisiana cotton fields.

[...] CCOP congregation leaders also <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> to the concerns of those in their networking contacts, the community, and the congregations. One of the main services of CCOP was conducting one-on-one's with individuals in the community, to recognize patterns' of residents' issues in the community. An example of this was CCOP's realization of drug dealings taking place in the city's vacant houses. These drug dealings were also often violent and dangerous. CCOP conducted more than 200 one-on-ones with citizens in the city of Camden. As a result of their findings, CCOP met with [...] institutions who were knowledgeable with regards to crime or housing from both the public and private sectors. It is approximated that about 20 of these meetings were held, with various attendees including the Camden police, local housing authority, and elected officials.|$|E

2500|$|Taking {{his seat}} in the House of Lords, Fitzwilliam {{attended}} almost every notable debate, signing nearly every protest which the opposition used but never made a speech during Lord North's premiership. He supported John Wilkes in his fight to keep the seat {{he was elected to}} and supported the American Colonies in their dispute with Britain. On 8 July 1776 he asked Lord Rockingham to arrange for a remonstrance to be sent to the King when war broke out in America, so the Americans would see [...] "that there is still in the country a body of men of the first rank and importance, who would still wish to govern them according to the old policy". George Selwyn MP recorded that on 6 March 1782 he had been confronted by Fitzwilliam at the Brooks's and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> to Fitzwilliam on the dire state of the nation: [...] "I do not know if he was in earnest, but I suppose that he was. He had worked himself up to commiserate the state of the country, nay, that of the king himself, [...] that I expected every instant that his heart would have burst". When Selwyn asked Fitzwilliam [...] "if there was a possibility of salvation in any position in which our affairs could be placed", Fitzwilliam [...] "asked me...with the utmost impetuosity, what objection I had to Lord Rock being sent for. You may be pretty sure, that if I had any, I should not have made it".|$|E
2500|$|In a {{response}} to some early negative reactions to the actress' performance, Jon Lachonis noted {{in a review of}} the first season's seventh episode that [...] "Anna Torv, whose chill portrayal of FBI agent and Pattern investigator Olivia Dunham has come under fire for being too wooden, seems to have reinvented her character to answer the critics. The good news is, Anna's new and more animated Olivia isn't really a departure so much as it is a character who seems to have had a catharsis. She is comfortable in her skin now, and the stillness is pulled back in favor of more humanity. Of course, it is helpful that she reunites with an old beau in this episode - if there is one thing Fringe is totally lacking it is sexual tension." [...] Executive producers Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman defended Torv's early Fringe work in a 2011 interview, explaining the character was designed to be [...] "bland, because of her conditioning as a child and everything she's been through. Now, one can argue that maybe that wasn't the best way for us to introduce the main character, but there was a purpose. So Anna <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> to all these people saying 'She's really doing nothing,' when really it was our issue. We didn't write anything for her because... well, now you know why. But at the time, people were like, 'Wow, this girl really is not much,' which is so not true. Anna was just so professional, and so great. She did it with excellence, and now she's really getting the chance to show people, 'Hey, I'm a really hard worker and a terrific actor.' We're so thankful that people can start to see her for who she really is. Midway through the second season, Sarah Stegall from SFScope believed Torv [...] "had the most progress and the most satisfying development" [...] of all the main actors, stating she [...] "is now carrying this role with grace and strength". Stegall partly attributed the growth of the actor and character to her recovery early in the second season, the introduction of a sister and niece, the removal of John Scott from her storyline, and the [...] "delicate, reserved flirtation" [...] with Peter.|$|E

(Anselma, a middle peasant woman in Jhagrapur). These quotes from women in Jhagrapur, a village in Bangladesh, illustrate {{the position of a}} large number of women with regard to land ownership and unequal power relations. Jenneke Arens investigated the complex relation between women’s land ownership and their position in the household, the family and society. She also analysed the role that women’s land ownership could play in their empowerment and in challenging and changing structural gender and class inequalities, in particular from the point of view of poor peasant women. This empirical study is a follow-up of the 1970 s village study Jhagrapur: Poor Peasant and Women in a Village in Bangladesh (Jenneke Arens & Jos van Beurden, 1977). It also covers changes in gender and class relations since 1975...|$|R
