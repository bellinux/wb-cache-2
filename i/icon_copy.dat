5|$|With {{support of}} the Kiev city authorities, architect-restorer Y. Lositskiy and others {{restored}} {{the western part of}} the stone walls. The belltower was restored next and became an observation platform. Instead of the original chiming clock, a new electronic one with hands and a set of chimes (a total of 40) was installed from which today the melodies of famous Ukrainian composers can be heard. The Cathedral was reconstructed last and decorated with a set of wooden baroque <b>icons,</b> <b>copies</b> of former mosaics and frescoes, and new works of art by Ukrainian artists.|$|R
50|$|The Chernigovsky skete in Sergiev Posad, Russia is {{a monastery}} {{standing}} unique in central Russia for hand-dug monk cells and prayer caves. Since 1990 {{it has been}} under restoration owing to state help and parishioner donations. After its blossom in the early 20th century {{as part of the}} Holy Trinity Sergius Lavra, the skete is regaining its status. Now about 10 monks live in the skit famous for its everyday unction sacrament with anointing. Pilgrims come here to bow to Elder Barnabas’ relics and 2 miracleous Chernigovskaya <b>icon</b> <b>copies.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Blachernitissa never rose to {{the height}} of veneration accorded by the Russian Orthodox Church to the Theotokos of Kazan or even to the Theotokos of the Iveron, an Athonite <b>icon</b> whose <b>copy</b> was {{commissioned}} by Patriarch Nikon. After Nikon's downfall and Alexis's death, the icon was neglected {{so much that it}} was not evacuated from the Kremlin during Napoleon's occupation and was put at risk during the Great Fire of 1812.|$|R
50|$|The four-part icon {{from church}} in the Orthodox Monastery of Virgin Mary's Birth in village Sogle, Čaška Municipality (near Veles, Macedonia) have {{decorative}} elements painted under influence of Cyrillic Molitvenik printed by Micalović. According to Dejan Medaković, renaissance decorative elements of this 16th-century <b>icon</b> are directly <b>copied</b> from Molitvenik printed by Micalović.|$|R
40|$|The article {{presents}} the complex scheme of palekh icon painting at the Higher school of folk arts (the Institute) including three systems: element-subject training (progressive studying of technical and technological features of Novgorod and Stroganov styles of <b>icon</b> painting by <b>copying</b> based on increasing complexity principle), complex training in copying, and individual creative education. The work describes in details {{the system of}} element-subject training in palekh icon painting at higher educational institutions and reveals the objective, problems, substance and forms. The training program “Copying works of icon painting” was considered since {{it is an important}} stage in students’ training in palekh <b>icon</b> painting by <b>copying</b> highly artistic training samples. The objectives of this program are adherence across all stages of image creation in icon painting, mastering technical skills, forming deep knowledge and professional skills in palekh icon painting in higher educational institution...|$|R
50|$|The Ministry ceased all {{support for}} the ICON in 1994, and Archives Ontario {{declined}} to take <b>ICON</b> hardware and <b>copies</b> of the <b>ICON</b> software, which were destroyed. This was controversial in its own right, as others maintained {{that it could be}} sent to other schools that lacked extensive Information Technology. Despite the development of the ICON program, equality among schools was not assured because each school community could afford different capital outlays depending on the parents' affluence.|$|R
5000|$|The Council of Ephesus decreed in 431 that Mary is the Theotokos {{because her}} son Jesus is both God and man: one divine person with two natures (divine and human) intimately and hypostatically united.Theotokos {{is also used}} as the term for an Eastern icon, or type of icon, of the Mother with Child (in the western {{tradition}} typically called a Madonna), as in [...] "the Theotokos of Vladimir" [...] both for the original 12th-century icon and for <b>icons</b> that are <b>copies</b> or imitate its composition.|$|R
50|$|Developers {{also use}} icon editors to make icons for {{specific}} program files. Assignment of an icon to a newly created program is usually done within the Integrated Development Environment {{used to develop}} that program. However, if one is creating an application in the Windows API {{he or she can}} simply add a line to the program's resource script before compilation. Many <b>icon</b> editors can <b>copy</b> a unique <b>icon</b> from a program file for editing. Only a few can assign an icon to a program file, a much more difficult task.|$|R
2500|$|There are {{far more}} {{varieties}} of icons of the Virgin Mary in Russian icon painting and religious use than of any other figure; Marian <b>icons</b> are commonly <b>copies</b> of images considered to be miraculous, {{of which there are}} hundreds: [...] "The icons of Mary were always deemed miraculous, those of her son rarely so". Icons of Mary most often depict her with the child Jesus in her arms; some, such as the [...] "Kaluga", [...] "Fiery-Faced" [...] "Gerondissa", [...] "Bogoliubovo", [...] "Vilna", [...] "Melter of Hard Hearts", [...] "Seven Swords", etc., along with icons that depict events in Mary's life before she gave birth to Jesus such as the Annunciation or Mary's own birth, omit the child.|$|R
50|$|The church {{dates to}} 1133. The present church was rebuilt in 1693-1714 at the {{commission}} of Pietro Barbarigo, and reconsecrated in 1721. It contains works by Antonio Vassilacchi (L'Aliense) (Resurrection), Domenico Cresti (il Passignano); Tintoretto, and Giulia Lama. The second altarpiece {{on the right is}} the Apotheosis of Saint Martial with Saints Peter and Paul. The Scuola del Santissimo Sacramento commissioned the altar (1691-1704) in the chancel attributed to Tommaso Rues. He also sculpted the elaborate marble main altar, depicting Christ Ruler of World with Saints and Angels is dedicated to the Blessed Virgin of the Graces. The <b>icon</b> is a <b>copy</b> of the original image supposedly sculpted in Rimini in 1286 by a shepherd named Rustico and miraculously brought to Venice.|$|R
50|$|In 1718 {{an icon of}} Madonna {{and child}} {{is said to have}} been {{discovered}} under the plaster of a wall in the adjacent sacristy building and the next year it was removed and installed above the main altar of Sts. Sergius and Bacchus at the order of Pope Clement XI (1700-21). The <b>icon</b> is a <b>copy</b> of an <b>icon</b> venerated at a Marian shrine in Zyrowice, a town now in Belarus, known as Our Lady of Zyrowice or Our Lady of the Pasture. That icon is said to have miraculously descended from the heavens in 1480 in the sight of a group of shepherds pasturing their animals. Sts. Sergius and Bacchus in Rome has thereafter also been called Madonna del Pascolo (Madonna of the Pasture).|$|R
25|$|Icon painting, in general, {{is not an}} {{opportunity}} for artistic expression, though each iconographer brings a vision to the piece. It is far more common for an <b>icon</b> to be <b>copied</b> from an older model, though with the recognition of a new saint in the church, a new icon must be created and approved. The personal and creative traditions of Catholic religious art were largely lacking in Orthodox iconography before the 17th century, when Russian iconography began to be strongly influenced by religious paintings and engravings from both Protestant and Roman Catholic Europe. Greek iconography also began {{to take on a}} strong western influence for a period and the difference between some Orthodox icons and western religious art began to vanish. More recently there has been a trend of returning to the more traditional and symbolic representations.|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} quarter century, {{a new form of}} iconic {{architecture}} has appeared throughout the world's major cities. Typically designed by globe-trotting "starchitects" or by a few large transnational architectural firms, these projects are almost always funded by the private sector in the service of private interests. Whereas in the past monumental architecture often had a strong public component, the urban ziggurats of today are emblems and conduits of capitalist globalization. In The Icon Project, Leslie Sklair focuses on ways in which capitalist globalization is produced and represented all over the world, especially in globalizing cities. Sklair traces how the iconic buildings of our era — elaborate shopping malls, spectacular museums, and vast urban megaprojects — constitute the triumphal "Icon Project" of contemporary global capitalism, promoting increasing inequality and hyperconsumerism. Two of the most significant strains of iconic architecture — unique icons recognized as works of art, designed by the likes of Gehry, Foster, Koolhaas, and Hadid, as well as successful, derivative <b>icons</b> that <b>copy</b> elements of the starchitects' work — speak to the centrality of hyperconsumerism within contemporary capitalism. Along with explaining how the architecture industry organizes the social production and marketing of iconic structures, he also shows how corporations increasingly dominate the built environment and promote the trend towards globalizing, consumerist cities. The Icon Project, Sklair argues, is a weapon in the struggle to solidify capitalist hegemony as well as reinforce transnational capitalist control of where we live, what we consume, and how we think...|$|R
50|$|Full {{copies of}} the Easter Proclamation are now treated as a revered Irish {{national}} <b>icon,</b> and a <b>copy</b> was sold at auction for €390,000 in December, 2004. A copy owned (and later signed as a memento) by Rising participant Seán T. O'Kelly was presented by him to the Irish parliament buildings, Leinster House, during his tenure as President of Ireland. It is currently on permanent display in the main foyer. Other copies are {{on display in the}} GPO (headquarters of the Rising and the place where the Proclamation was first read), the National Museum of Ireland, the Trinity College Library's Long Room and other museums worldwide. Facsimile copies are sold as souvenirs in Ireland, and {{copies of the}} text are often displayed in Irish schools and in Irish pubs throughout the world. The proclamation is read aloud by an Officer of the Irish Defence Forces outside the GPO during the Easter Rising commemorations on Easter Sunday of each year.|$|R
40|$|The six icons {{from the}} {{collection}} of Marian icons from the National Museum of History of Moldova represent the image of Our Lady of Hârbovăţ. Of these, three are large processional ones and the others are smaller, home icons. The techniques of their manufacture are different: from tempera and oil on wood and gilding with gold leaf to chasing the fish glue gesso and enamel paints. All these icons are Russian and Bessarabian and are dated {{from the end of the}} 19 th and early 20 th centuries. As is known, the appearance of the icon of Our Lady of Hârbovăţ in the monastery dates from the late 18 th century and is connected with the name of a Russian officer Nikolai Albaduev. Sources indicate that it was a family heirloom, handed down from generation to generation. In the monastery it proved to be a miracle-working <b>icon.</b> Multiple <b>copies</b> of it have spread in Bessarabia and beyond, and soon the image has become widely known as the icon of Our Lady of Hârbovăţ. On April 17, 1859 the Holy Synod has recognized its miraculous properties and approved the requests of Chisinau residents, allowing annually, from October 1 to April 17, with a procession to transfer the icon of Our Lady of Hârbovăţ from the monastery to Chişinău. This image is of the Hodegetria type. The image of the Virgin is presented till the knees; she holds the Child on her left hand and points at him with her right hand. The Savior blesses with his right hand, and in his left hand he holds a scroll. Their heads are inclined to each other. The distinctive elements of this type of Marian iconography are the outstretched more than usual right arm of the Savior, his light shirt with a belt, sad face of the Virgin and floral decoration of her garments. ...|$|R
