40|$|Block caving methods rely on {{gravity to}} break and {{transport}} {{large amounts of}} ore and waste. Despite the importance of gravity flow, there is debate within the literature about the influence that the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>draw,</b> particle size and particle size distribution has on the geometry of extraction and movement zones. This paper {{presents the results of}} an experimental programme conducted in the largest three-dimensional (3 D) physical model to investigate the mechanisms of flow of cohesionless materials when drawing from a single drawpoint. Experimental results showed that isolated draw zones are mainly influenced by mass drawn and <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>draw.</b> Particle size was found to have a slight effect on extraction zones and no significant effect on movement zone width. Particle size composition (wide or narrow distributions) and drawpoint width were found not to have a major role on drawzone geometry. Those conclusions were based on statistical analysis of experimental data to define the controlling parameters in isolated draw. Model theory principles were used to investigate within the physical modelling framework the possibility of directly scaling the geometry of the extraction zones, which indicated that flow zones could be scaled in cohesionless materials under a set of assumptions. A mechanistic model of isolated draw is also postulated from experimental data from observations of stresses and the IMZ 2 ̆ 7 s geometry. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, {{we study}} {{drawings}} of maximal outerplanar graphs that place vertices on integer coordinates. We {{introduce a new}} class of graphs, called umbrellas, and a new method of splitting maximal outerplanar graphs into systems of umbrellas. By doing so, we generate a new graph parameter, called the umbrella depth (ud), {{that can be used to}} approximate the optimal <b>height</b> <b>of</b> a <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> a maximal outerplanar graph. We show that for any maximal outerplanar graph G, we can create a flat visibility representation <b>of</b> G with <b>height</b> at most 2 ud(G) + 1. This drawing can be transformed into a straight-line <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> the same <b>height.</b> We then prove that the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> any <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> G is at least ud(G) + 1, which makes our result a 2 -approximation for the optimal height. The best previously known approximation algorithm gave a 4 -approximation. In addition, we provide an algorithm for finding the umbrella depth of G in linear time. Lastly, we compare the umbrella depth to other graph parameters such as the pathwidth and the rooted pathwidth, which have been used in the past for outerplanar graph drawing algorithms...|$|R

40|$|Abstrac: The {{deep drawing}} process {{is used in the}} modern {{industry}} extensively to produce specific parts with desirable shape. Material properties of the blank have a significant effect not only on the quality of formed part but also on the determination of process parameters. Earing is the well-known phenomena in this process that decreases the product yield. That is affected by material anisotropy and it is important to investigate the influence of material parameters on this material behavior. In this study, the deep <b>draw</b> ability <b>of</b> thin sheet of low carbon steel has been experimentally investigated. Based on deep drawing test, the earing phenomenon due to planar anisotropy in low carbon steel sheet was observed and the different <b>height</b> <b>of</b> cups at any direction with respect to rolling direction was measured {{in order to determine the}} r-value of sheet. Earing tendency during drawing is increased at higher planar anisotropy. By difference in <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>drawn</b> cup, the r-value was measured successfully. It was found that maximum cup height take place in 0 ° and 90 ° relation to rolling direction and in this area thickness of cup wall is less than other direction...|$|R

This paper {{considers}} ideal drawings of rooted trees with the objective of keeping the width of such drawings small. It is not known whether finding the minimum-possible width is NP-hard or polynomial. This paper gives a 2 -approximation for this problem, and a 2 Δ-approximation (for Δ-ary trees) where additionally the height is O(n). For trees with Δ≤ 3, the former algorithm finds ideal drawings with minimum-possible width. Comment: 16 pages. Re-organized, and removed overlap with 1506. 02096.

40|$|Friction aided {{deep drawing}} using a {{polyurethane}} ring as a pressure medium has been analyzed by the slab {{and the energy}} methods to understand the main features {{of the process and}} to find the optimum conditions to achieve successful <b>drawing.</b> The effect <b>of</b> an auxiliary metal punch on the stress distribution of the deformed blank and the increase in <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>drawn</b> cup is also discussed. From these studies, the reason why the unusual circumferential crack occurs at the flange of the deformed blank has been clarified, based on the radial stress distribution of the deformed blank. A process parameter, which denotes the <b>drawing</b> characteristics <b>of</b> the friction aided deep drawing, has been proposed. In addition, the drawing region diagram has been presented to facilitate the drawing pressure control with the progress <b>of</b> the <b>drawing</b> process. It is shown that the successful drawing region is narrow at the early stage <b>of</b> <b>drawing,</b> although it becomes wide as the drawing proceeds. Therefore, in the early stage <b>of</b> <b>drawing,</b> special care should be paid to the drawing pressure control to avoid the flange crack. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|There {{remains a}} {{debate within the}} {{literature}} and among practitioners of caving methods as to the effect on draw zone geometry for the concurrent <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> multiple drawpoints. Concurrent draw refers to an extraction schedule where a limited amount <b>of</b> material is <b>drawn</b> from each drawpoint {{before moving to the}} next drawpoint to draw the same amount. One hypothesis concludes that the flow geometries of a single drawpoint increase while another assumes no change from that <b>of</b> isolated <b>draw.</b> The largest 3 D physical model constructed using gravel as the model media has been used to further investigate interactive <b>draw</b> <b>of</b> extraction zones as part of an International Caving Study (ICS) and Mass Mining Technology Project supported by major international companies with interest in caving methods. All extraction zones were measured in 3 D. To date a maximum of 10 drawpoints have been modelled. Model results so far indicate no growth in the horizontal width of extraction zones using concurrent draw. Experiments conducted with multiple drawpoints that were spaced less than the width of isolated extraction zones showed that the combined horizontal area <b>of</b> <b>draw</b> appears to reduce with the increasing overlap of isolated extraction zones. The horizontal widths of extraction zones continued to increase within the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>draw</b> tested...|$|R
40|$|Contact-mode atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM) -based anodization patterning {{was performed}} on silicon (Si) substrates covered with a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) in order to investigate effects of relative humidity (RH), surface wetability of the SAM, and probe-tip material on widths and <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> <b>drawn</b> lines. Three types of SAMs, that is, methyl-terminated, ester-terminated, and carboxyl-terminated SAMs, were prepared on hydrogen-terminated Si substrates by a thermal activation method. These SAMs were covalently fixed on the Si substrates through Si–C bonds without an interfacial oxide layer between the SAM and Si. Rh-coated and boron-doped conductive diamond-coated AFM probe tips were used for patterning with a positive sample bias of 10  V. Consequently, the region scanned with the AFM probe became protruded due to degradation of the SAM and anodization of Si. When the Rh-coated Si tip was used, {{the width of the}} protruded line increased with increasing RH on each SAM sample. The linewidth on the most hydrophobic methyl-terminated SAM was narrowest, while that on the most hydrophilic carboxylic SAM was widest. However there was no distinct difference in the pattern width at the patterning under low RH of 10 %. In the case of patterning with the boron-doped conductive diamond-coated tip on the ester SAM, the width of the patterned line showed no clear increase with increasing RH. These pattern width changes were discussed in terms of the size of adsorbed water meniscus at the AFM-tip/sample junction as confirmed by force curve measurements; {{in the case of the}} boron-doped conductive diamond-coated tip which is rather more hydrophobic than the Rh-coated Si tip, the size of water meniscus hardly affected RH...|$|R
