In addition, readers’ negative <b>feelings</b> <b>in</b> library were found to result from libraries’ regulations/management, other readers, facilities, environment/space, library staff, collection, and information technology/software.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s Donen signed a non-exclusive, three-film deal with Columbia Pictures. His first film under this {{contract}} was Once More, with <b>Feeling!</b> <b>in</b> 1960. Adapted by Harry Kurnitz {{from his own}} stage play, the film was shot in Paris and starred Yul Brynner and Kay Kendall. Brynner plays a tyrannical orchestra conductor whose mistress (Kendall) grows tired of his tantrums and plots to marry him in order to quickly divorce him for his money. Kendall was terminally ill with leukemia during the shoot and died before its release. The film was not successful financially or critically.|$|E
5|$|The local {{symptoms}} of victims bitten by the many-banded krait are usually neither serious swelling nor pain; the victims merely feel slightly itchy and numb. Systemic symptoms occur, in general, one {{to six hours}} after being bitten by this snake. Symptoms may include bilateral ptosis, diplopia, discomfort in the chest, general ache, weak <b>feeling</b> <b>in</b> limbs, ataxia, glossolysis, loss of voice, dysphagia, tunnel vision, and difficulty breathing. In case of serious bite, suppression of breathing may occur, leading to death. Hyponatremia is also seen, but less commonly.|$|E
5|$|A congratulatory {{telegram}} to Kruger from Kaiser Wilhelm II on 3 January {{prompted a}} storm of anti-Boer and anti-German <b>feeling</b> <b>in</b> Britain, with Jameson becoming lionised as a result. Kruger shouted down talk {{of the death penalty}} for the imprisoned Jameson or a campaign of retribution against Johannesburg, challenging his more bellicose commandants to depose him if they disagreed, and accepted Robinson's proposed mediation with alacrity. After confiscating the weapons and munitions the Reform Committee had stockpiled, Kruger handed Jameson and his troops over to British custody and granted amnesty to all the Johannesburg conspirators except for 64 leading members, who were charged with high treason. The four main leaders—Lionel Phillips, John Hays Hammond, George Farrar and Frank Rhodes (brother of Cecil)—pleaded guilty in April 1896 and were sentenced to hang, but Kruger quickly had this commuted to fines of £25,000 each.|$|E

5|$|Banks and Rutherford {{suggested}} the band take an extended hiatus, hoping Collins would save his marriage {{and that the}} band could work with him in Vancouver. Banks recorded a solo album A Curious <b>Feeling</b> <b>in</b> Polar Studios, Stockholm with Genesis touring drummer Chester Thompson and singer Kim Beacon, while Rutherford also recorded his first solo album, Smallcreep's Day, at the same studio. In April 1979, Collins returned to the UK after the attempt to salvage his marriage failed. With time to spare before working on the next Genesis album, he gigged with Brand X, and began work on demo tracks for what became his first solo album Face Value {{at his home in}} Shalford, Surrey. As well as playing piano and synthesizers, he had recently picked up a Roland drum machine and become interested in the possibilities of electronic drums.|$|E
5|$|Concussion, {{also known}} as minor head trauma or mild {{traumatic}} brain injury (mTBI) {{is the most common}} type of traumatic brain injury. It is typically defined as a head injury with a temporary loss of brain function. Symptoms include a variety of physical, cognitive, and emotional symptoms, which may not be recognized if subtle. A variety of signs accompany concussion including headache, <b>feeling</b> <b>in</b> a fog, and emotional changeability. In general, the signs can be categorized into physical signs (such as loss of consciousness or amnesia), behavioral changes (such as irritability), cognitive impairment (such as slowed reaction times), and sleep disturbances. Fewer than 10% of sports-related concussions among children are associated with loss of consciousness.|$|E
5|$|During the First World War, Queen Mary instituted an {{austerity}} {{drive at}} the palace, where she rationed food, and visited wounded and dying servicemen in hospital, which caused her great emotional strain. After {{three years of}} war against Germany, and with anti-German <b>feeling</b> <b>in</b> Britain running high, the Russian Imperial Family, which had been deposed by a revolutionary government, was refused asylum, possibly {{in part because the}} Tsar's wife was German-born. News of the Tsar's abdication provided a boost to those in Britain who wished to replace their own monarchy with a republic. The war ended in 1918 with the defeat of Germany and the abdication and exile of the Kaiser.|$|E

40|$|The diagnosticity of <b>feelings</b> <b>in</b> {{judgment}} depends {{not only}} on their representativeness and relevance, but also on people’s trust <b>in</b> their <b>feelings</b> <b>in</b> general. Trust <b>in</b> <b>feelings</b> {{is the degree to}} which individuals believe that their feelings generally point toward the “right” direction in judgments and decisions. Six studies show that a higher trust <b>in</b> <b>feelings</b> (a) increases the reliance on feelings as a judgment criterion, (b) amplifies the influence of ad-induced <b>feelings</b> <b>in</b> persuasion, (c) magnifies the ratio bias in risky choice, and (d) increases the rejection of unfair offers in the ultimatum game. Further, (e) when feelings are highly relevant, they are relied upon regardless of the level of trust, whereas when feelings have low relevance, they are relied upon only if people trust them. Finally, (f) assessments of trust <b>in</b> <b>feelings</b> require significant processing resources. A refined model of feelings as information is advanced based on these findings...|$|R
5|$|In 1987, in Canada, Elizabeth {{publicly}} supported politically divisive constitutional amendments, prompting {{criticism from}} {{opponents of the}} proposed changes, including Pierre Trudeau. The same year, the elected Fijian government was deposed in a military coup. As monarch of Fiji, Elizabeth supported the attempts of the Governor-General, Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau, to assert executive power and negotiate a settlement. Coup leader Sitiveni Rabuka deposed Ganilau and declared Fiji a republic. By the start of 1991, republican <b>feeling</b> <b>in</b> Britain had risen because of press estimates of the Queen's private wealth – which were contradicted by the Palace – and reports of affairs and strained marriages among her extended family. The involvement of younger {{members of the royal}} family in the charity game show It's a Royal Knockout was ridiculed, and the Queen was the target of satire.|$|E
5|$|Invalided out {{of service}} in June 1941, Bradman spent months recuperating, unable even to shave himself or comb his hair due {{to the extent of}} the muscular pain he suffered. He resumed {{stockbroking}} during 1942. In his biography of Bradman, Charles Williams expounded the theory that the physical problems were psychosomatic, induced by stress and possibly depression; Bradman read the book's manuscript and did not disagree. Had any cricket been played at this time, he would not have been available. Although he found some relief in 1945 when referred to the Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders, Bradman permanently lost the <b>feeling</b> <b>in</b> the thumb and index finger of his (dominant) right hand.|$|E
5|$|Often {{categorized}} as a rationalist philosopher, Wollstonecraft demonstrates {{her commitment to}} and appreciation of <b>feeling</b> <b>in</b> Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. She argues that subjective experiences, such as the transcendent emotions prompted by the sublime and the beautiful, possess a value equal to the objective truths discovered through reason. In Wollstonecraft's earlier works, reason was paramount, because it allowed access to universal truths. In Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, however, reason serves {{as a tool for}} reflection, mediating between the sensual experiences of the world and an abstract notion of truth (not necessarily universal truth). Maturation is not only the acquisition of reason—the view Wollstonecraft had adopted in Original Stories from Real Life (1788)—but also an understanding of when and how to trust one's emotions.|$|E

5|$|A {{key element}} of the {{gameplay}} is its focus on guns over swords and magic. When deciding upon the game's basics, the team {{wanted to create a}} cinematic <b>feeling</b> <b>in</b> battles. If they had gone with a more traditional battle system, then it would have quickly lost its cinematic quality due to the prevalence of close combat. Likewise, they wanted the cinematic feel to persist throughout the whole game rather than restricted to cutscenes. A major challenge was {{to strike a balance between}} accessibility and difficulty when developing for a player base that might be made of up of both action game and RPG players. This resulted in the addition of strategy elements. Another wish was to create something new and fresh in the RPG market. When creating the gameplay style, the team looked at action movies such as The Matrix and Rebellion during their research. Despite its fast-paced action, the game relies heavily upon strategic, turn-based gameplay. During early development, the game was based on a real-time system and meant for only one character to be controlled by the player; the other two would have been handled by the game's artificial intelligence (AI). After some testing, they decided that this would create unwanted difficulties in gameplay such as characters dying off-screen without the player noticing or the AI not directing them properly.|$|E
5|$|Leeds {{finished}} {{just five}} points above the Second Division relegation {{zone in the}} 1960–61 season and Taylor resigned; his replacement, Don Revie, was promoted from the United first team, and initially he was not fond of Charlton. Revie played Charlton up front {{at the start of}} the 1961–62 season, but he soon moved him back to centre-half after he proved ineffective as a centre-forward. He soon became frustrated and difficult to manage, <b>feeling</b> <b>in</b> limbo playing for a club seemingly going nowhere whilst his younger brother was enjoying great success at Manchester United. Revie told Charlton that he was prepared to let him go in 1962, but never actually transfer listed him. Liverpool manager Bill Shankly failed to meet the £30,000 Leeds demanded for Charlton and though Manchester United manager Matt Busby was initially willing to pay the fee he eventually decided to instead try an untested youngster at centre-half. During these discussions Charlton refused to sign a new contract at Leeds, but felt frustrated by Busby's hesitance and so signed a new contract with Leeds whilst making a promise to Revie to be more professional in his approach.|$|E
5|$|Most {{party members}} were teachers, {{employees}} of the French colonial government or non-commissioned officers in the colonial army. The VNQDD campaigned mainly among these facets of societythere were few workers or peasants in its ranks. The party's popularity {{was based on a}} groundswell of anti-French <b>feeling</b> <b>in</b> northern Vietnam in the 1920s; many writers had assailed society for glorifying military actions against China, Champa, Siam and Cambodia, Vietnam's historical rivals, while neglecting to oppose French colonialism. The VNQDD admitted many female members, which was quite revolutionary for the time. It set about seeking alliances with other nationalist factions in Vietnam. In a meeting on July 4, 1928, the Central Committee appealed for unity among the Vietnamese revolutionary movements, sending delegates to meet with other organisations struggling for independence. The preliminary contacts did not yield any concrete alliances. The VNQDD also assailed the Vietnamese communists of Ho Chi Minh for betraying the leading nationalist of the timePhan Bội Châuto the French in return for a financial reward. Ho had done this to eliminate other nationalist rivals. The VNQDD would later be {{on the receiving end of}} another of Ho's manoeuvres.|$|E
