40|$|Abstract. Global to {{regional}} datasets from coarse spatial resolution satellite sensors are increasingly becoming available. Land cover and vegetation extent maps {{are among the}} terrestrial products derived from such data. Whilst they provide a previously unavailable synoptic view of global situations, accuracy assessment methodological issues are often ignored when creating these digital databases or producing statistics from such sources. This paper looks at how these issues are addressed {{in the framework of}} the <b>Joint</b> <b>Research</b> <b>Centre’s</b> TREES (Tropical Ecosystem Environment observation by Satellite) project, initiated to map and monitor the pan-tropical humid forest belt using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data. The paper shows that without accuracy assessment and a correction procedure, both the thematic legend and statistical data derived from coarse spatial maps can be misleading. 1...|$|R

The objective of SIGMEA is to set up a science-based framework, including strategies, methods and tools, for assessing the environmental and economic impact of genetically modified crops and for effectively managing their development within European cropping systems. JRC-IPTS is the lead body for a work package looking into the socioeconomic dimension of GM crops in Europe. Some of the results of this work package are summed up in this report which analyses the economic impact of the first GM crop introduced in European agriculture. JRC.

The peculiarity of SIMLAB, in contrast to previous versions of the package, is the possibility to run sequential sensitivity analysis, which allows updating the sensitivity measures at each run, or group of runs, of the model. The techniques can be accessed through the R environment as well as through a graphical user interface. The user can also add new techniques by simply adding the corresponding R code to the core layer. SIMLAB can be downloaded for free from the <b>Joint</b> <b>Research</b> <b>Centre’s</b> website. JRC.

Results of calorimetry measurements carried out, both inside and outside a well-controlled environment of a climatic chamber, on reference PuGa samples and well-characterised 241 Am samples are presented and discussed.
