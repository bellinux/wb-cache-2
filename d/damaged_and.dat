5|$|Overall, almost 36,000residences {{were damaged}} {{as a result}} of Catarina's onslaught; of those, 993 {{collapsed}} completely. The commercial sector fared slightly better, as only 2,274buildings were <b>damaged</b> <b>and</b> 472 collapsed. Finally, 397public buildings were <b>damaged</b> <b>and</b> three were destroyed. These account for 26% of the total buildings in the region, and property damage of $25.6million (2004 USD $ USD). Four-fifths of the damaged houses had some sort of roof failure or collapse. Most of the damage was blamed on the low quality of the construction; brick residences typically lacked plaster, beams, or columns, for example. The areas affected the most were those inhabited by low-income families, usually with annual family salaries of less than $400USD.|$|E

40|$|Lipid peroxidation <b>and</b> DNA <b>damage</b> were {{evaluated}} in liver slices incubated for 2 h at 37 degrees C with 1 mM-t-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH), 1 mM-BrCCl 3 or 50 microM-ferrous iron. t-BOOH induced {{the greatest amount}} of <b>damage</b> to DNA <b>and</b> increased the production of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS). Both phenomena depended on the incubation time. Ferrous iron induced both DNA <b>damage</b> <b>and</b> TBARS production, and BrCCl 3 did not induce significant DNA <b>damage</b> <b>and</b> was the weakest TBARS inducer. Butylated hydroxytoluene at 1 mM inhibited both DNA <b>damage</b> <b>and</b> TBARS production.

5|$|With Marengo <b>damaged</b> <b>and</b> Rainier {{actively}} {{hunting for}} his squadron, Linois {{withdrew from the}} Bay of Bengal and returned to Isle de France. Rainier knew that his chances of discovering Linois in the open Indian Ocean were insignificant, and instead decided to keep watch for him off his principal base at Port Napoleon. A squadron was detached to the port, but Linois's scouts discovered the blockade before he arrived {{and he was able}} to safely reach Grand Port instead on 31 October. Entering over the reefs that protected the anchorage, Marengos deeper keel scraped on the coral. The ship's hull was badly <b>damaged</b> <b>and</b> her rudder torn off, requiring extensive repairs.
