5|$|Controlled {{fermentation}} with microbes in brewing, wine making, baking, pickling and cultured {{dairy products}} such as yogurt and cheese, is used to modify ingredients to make foods with desirable properties. The principal microbes involved are yeasts, {{in the case of}} beer, wine, and ordinary bread; and bacteria, in the case of anaerobically fermented vegetables, dairy products, and sourdough bread. The cultures variously provide <b>flavour</b> <b>and</b> <b>aroma,</b> inhibit pathogens, increase digestibility and palatability, make bread rise, reduce cooking time, and create useful products including alcohol, organic acids, vitamins, amino acids, and carbon dioxide.|$|E
5|$|When collected, {{the skin}} of the cap is left intact, and dirt is brushed off the surface. Pores are left unless old and soft. Boletus aereus is {{especially}} suited for drying, a process which enhances its <b>flavour</b> <b>and</b> <b>aroma.</b> Like other boletes, the mushrooms can be dried by being sliced and strung separately on twine, then hung close to the ceiling of a kitchen. Alternatively, the mushrooms can be dried by cleaning with a brush (washing is not recommended), and then placed in a wicker basket or bamboo steamer on top of a boiler or hot water tank. Once dry, they are kept in an airtight jar. They are easily reconstituted by soaking in hot, but not boiling, water for about twenty minutes; the water is infused with the mushroom aroma and can be used as stock in subsequent cooking. When dried, a small amount of the mushroom can improve the taste of less flavoursome fungi-based dishes.|$|E
25|$|Oxidation {{can occur}} {{throughout}} the winemaking process, {{and even after}} the wine has been bottled. Anthocyanins, catechins, epicatechins and other phenols present in wine are those most easily oxidised, {{which leads to a}} loss of colour, <b>flavour</b> <b>and</b> <b>aroma</b> - sometimes referred to as flattening. In most cases compounds such as sulfur dioxide or erythorbic acid are added to wine by winemakers, which protect the wine from oxidation and also bind with some of the oxidation products to reduce their organoleptic effect. Apart from phenolic oxidation, the ethanol present within wine can also be oxidised into other compounds responsible for <b>flavour</b> <b>and</b> <b>aroma</b> taints.|$|E
50|$|The pods are {{relatively}} flavourless when first picked <b>and</b> the typical <b>flavours</b> <b>and</b> <b>aromas</b> arise during the curing process. The main active ingredients are vanillin, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde and vanillic acid.|$|R
50|$|Top-fermenting yeast {{typically}} ferments {{at higher}} temperatures 15 - 23 C, producing {{significant amounts of}} esters <b>and</b> other secondary <b>flavours</b> <b>and</b> <b>aromas,</b> often resembling those of apple, pear, pineapple, grass, hay, banana, plum or prune.|$|R
50|$|All arabica {{coffee in}} Indonesia is picked by hand, {{whether it is}} grown by smallholders or on {{medium-sized}} estates. After harvest, the coffee is processed {{in a variety of}} ways, each imparting its own <b>flavours</b> <b>and</b> <b>aromas</b> to the final product.|$|R
25|$|Cumin seed {{is used as}} a spice for its {{distinctive}} <b>flavour</b> <b>and</b> <b>aroma.</b> Cumin can be found in some cheeses, such as Leyden cheese, and in some traditional breads from France. Cumin can be an ingredient in chili powder (often Tex-Mex or Mexican-style), and is found in achiote blends, adobos, sofrito, garam masala, curry powder, and bahaarat. In South Asian cooking, it is often combined with coriander seeds in a powdered mixture called dhana jeera.|$|E
25|$|Geosmin is a {{compound}} {{with a very}} distinct earthy, musty, beetroot, even turnip <b>flavour</b> <b>and</b> <b>aroma</b> and has an extremely low sensory threshold of down to 10 parts per trillion. Its presence in wine is usually derived as metabolite from the growth of filamentous actinomycetes such as Streptomyces, and moulds such as Botrytis cinerea and Penicillium expansum, on grapes. Wines affected by but not attributed to geosmins are often thought to have earthy properties due to terroir. The geosmin fault occurs worldwide and {{has been found in}} recent vintages of red wines from Beaujolais, Bordeaux, Burgundy and the Loire in France. Geosmin is also thought to be a contributing factor in cork taint.|$|E
25|$|Pepper loses <b>flavour</b> <b>and</b> <b>aroma</b> through evaporation, so {{airtight}} storage helps {{preserve its}} spiciness longer. Pepper can also lose flavour {{when exposed to}} light, which can transform piperine into nearly tasteless isochavicine. Once ground, pepper's aromatics can evaporate quickly; most culinary sources recommend grinding whole peppercorns immediately before use for this reason. Handheld pepper mills or grinders, which mechanically grind or crush whole peppercorns, are used for this, sometimes instead of pepper shakers that dispense pre-ground pepper. Spice mills such as pepper mills were found in European kitchens {{as early as the}} 14th century, but the mortar and pestle used earlier for crushing pepper have remained a popular method for centuries as well.|$|E

50|$|A broth {{made with}} meat or meat bones creates a base with {{concentrated}} <b>flavours</b> <b>and</b> <b>aromas,</b> {{even without the}} addition of salt or herbs or spices. This is what {{is referred to as}} soup base. Stock pots are also used for cooking stews, porridge, boiled foods, steamed shellfish, and a vast variety of recipes.|$|R
50|$|Unlike other grape brandies, pisco is {{distilled}} only once. It is also distilled from wine, {{rather than}} grape pomace, {{and is not}} aged in barrels. It thus retains many of the fresh <b>flavours</b> <b>and</b> <b>aromas</b> that {{were found in the}} young wine, in the form of small and highly volatile molecules called aldehydes and esters.|$|R
500|$|The sweet wort {{collected}} from sparging {{is put into}} a kettle, or [...] "copper" [...] (so called because these vessels were traditionally made from copper), and boiled, usually for about one hour. During boiling, water in the wort evaporates, but the sugars and other components of the wort remain; this allows more efficient use of the starch sources in the beer. Boiling also destroys any remaining enzymes {{left over from the}} mashing stage. Hops are added during boiling as a source of bitterness, <b>flavour</b> <b>and</b> <b>aroma.</b> Hops may be added at more than one point during the boil. The longer the hops are boiled, the more bitterness they contribute, but the less hop <b>flavour</b> <b>and</b> <b>aroma</b> remains in the beer.|$|E
500|$|Top-fermented beers {{are most}} {{commonly}} produced with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a top-fermenting yeast which clumps and {{rises to the}} surface, typically between [...] At these temperatures, yeast produces significant amounts of esters and other secondary <b>flavour</b> <b>and</b> <b>aroma</b> products, {{and the result is}} often a beer with slightly [...] "fruity" [...] compounds resembling apple, pear, pineapple, banana, plum, or prune, among others.|$|E
2500|$|Sulfur {{is used as}} an {{additive}} {{throughout the}} winemaking process, primarily to stop oxidation as mentioned above but also as [...] antimicrobial agent. When managed properly in wine, its presence there is often undetected, however when used recklessly it can contribute to <b>flavour</b> <b>and</b> <b>aroma</b> taints which are very volatile and potent. Sulfur compounds typically have low sensory thresholds.|$|E
50|$|Despite this diversity, some unifying threads emerge. Varied uses {{of spices}} are an {{integral}} part of certain food preparations and are used to enhance the flavour of a dish <b>and</b> create unique <b>flavours</b> <b>and</b> <b>aromas.</b> Cuisine across India has also been influenced by various cultural groups that entered India throughout history, such as the Central Asians, Arabs, Mughals, and European colonists. Sweets are also very popular among Indians, particularly in Bengal where both Bengali Hindus and Bengali Muslims distribute sweets to mark joyous occasions.|$|R
50|$|The {{microclimate}} of both vineyards {{is influenced}} by the proximity of the sea (a few kilometers) and the cool breeze that is generated by promoting the development of <b>flavours</b> <b>and</b> <b>aromas</b> of fresh fruit and balanced acidity in white grapes, deep colour and ripe tannins and pleasant in reds. In Suarez the relative heigh of terrain reinforces the effect of wind, rapidly cooling the vines, citrus nuances giving white grapes and red fruits in reds. In Cuatro Piedras appears pear and apple notes on whites, and earthy and mineral in reds.|$|R
5000|$|Bourgueil: {{lying to}} the north of the Loire river, between Chinon and Saumur, the Bourgueil region is one of the largest {{wine-growing}} areas of Touraine. This is the Cabernet Franc country, the region straddles the Touraine and Anjou regions. Depending on the nature of the soil, two different kinds of wine grow alongside each other within the Bourgueil appellation area. Wines from fine gravel soils, must be drunk when very young, while wines from calcareous tuffeau soils develop their <b>flavours</b> <b>and</b> <b>aromas</b> a year later. Bourgueil wines age well for a very long time.|$|R
2500|$|Lightstruck {{wines are}} those that have had {{excessive}} exposure to ultraviolet light, particularly in the range 325 to 450nm. Very delicate wines, such as Champagnes, are generally worst affected, with the fault causing a wet cardboard or wet wool type <b>flavour</b> <b>and</b> <b>aroma.</b> Red wines rarely become lightstruck because of the phenolic compounds present within the wine that protect it. Lightstrike {{is thought to be}} caused by sulfur compounds such as dimethyl sulfide. In France lightstrike is known as [...] "goût de lumière", which translates to a taste of light. The fault explains why wines are generally bottled in coloured glass, which blocks the ultraviolet light, and why wine should be stored in dark environments.|$|E
2500|$|Geranium taint, as {{the name}} suggests, is a <b>flavour</b> <b>and</b> <b>aroma</b> taint in wine {{reminiscent}} of geranium leaves. The compound responsible is 2-ethoxyhexa-3,5-diene, which has a low sensory threshold concentration of 1ng/L. In wine it is formed during the metabolism of potassium sorbate by lactic acid bacteria. Potassium sorbate is sometimes added to wine as a preservative against yeast, however its use is generally {{kept to a minimum}} due to the possibility of the taint developing. The production of the taint begins with the conversion of sorbic acid to the alcohol sorbinol. The alcohol is then isomerised in the presence of acid to 3,5-hexadiene-2-ol, which is then esterified with ethanol to form 2-ethoxy-3,5-hexadiene. [...] Mannitol is usually produced in wines that undergo malolactic fermentation {{with a high level of}} residual sugars still present. Expert winemakers oftentimes add small amounts of sulfur dioxide during the crushing step to reduce early bacterial growth.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{at least}} the 11th century, and {{probably}} earlier, hops {{have been used in}} beer for their natural preservative qualities {{as well as for the}} pleasant bitterness, <b>flavour,</b> <b>and</b> <b>aroma</b> they impart. Since the method of inoculation and long fermentation time of lambic beers increases the risk of spoilage, lambic brewers use large amounts of hops for their antibacterial properties. Lambic in the early 19th century was a highly hopped beer, using 8–9 g/l of the locally grown Aalst or Poperinge varieties. Modern lambic brewers, however, try to avoid making the beer extremely hop forward and utilise aged, dry hops which have lost much of their bitterness, aroma and flavour. Consequently, lambics often have a strong, cheese-like, [...] "old hop" [...] aroma, in contrast to the resiny, herbal, earthy hop bitterness found in other styles. The favourite hop used for lambic in the nineteenth century was a variety called Coigneau which was cultivated in the Aalst-Asse area in Belgium.|$|E
50|$|Some recipes {{call for}} the spices to be blended with herbs, while others {{call for the}} spices to be ground with water, vinegar, or other liquids, to make a paste. In some recipes, {{ingredients}} including nuts, onions, or garlic may be added. Some recipes also call for small quantities of star anise, asafoetida, chili, stone flower (known as dagadphool), and kababchini (cubeb). The flavours may be carefully blended to achieve a balanced effect, or a single flavour may be emphasized. A masala may be toasted before use to release its <b>flavours</b> <b>and</b> <b>aromas.</b>|$|R

A Scotch whisky labelled as [...] "natural" [...] or [...] "non-chill-filtered" [...] {{has not been}} through a filtration process during bottling that removes compounds that some consumers see as desirable. Whisky is aged in various types of casks—and often in used sherry or port casks—during distinct portions of the maturation process, and will take on characteristics, <b>flavour</b> <b>and</b> <b>aromas</b> from such casks.
