5|$|Plantar {{fasciitis}} {{is usually}} diagnosed by a <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>provider</b> after consideration of a person's presenting history, risk factors, and clinical examination. Tenderness to palpation along the inner {{aspect of the}} heel bone on the {{sole of the foot}} may be elicited during the physical examination. The foot may have limited dorsiflexion due to tightness of the calf muscles or the Achilles tendon. Dorsiflexion of the foot may elicit the pain due to stretching of the plantar fascia with this motion. Diagnostic imaging studies are not usually needed to diagnose plantar fasciitis. However, in certain cases a physician may decide imaging studies (such as X-rays, diagnostic ultrasound or MRI) are warranted to rule out serious causes of foot pain.|$|E

5|$|Treatment of TB uses {{antibiotics}} to {{kill the}} bacteria. Effective TB treatment is difficult, due to the unusual structure and chemical composition of the mycobacterial cell wall, which hinders the entry of drugs and makes many antibiotics ineffective. The two antibiotics most commonly used are isoniazid and rifampicin, and treatments can be prolonged, taking several months. Latent TB treatment usually employs a single antibiotic, while active TB disease is best treated with combinations of several antibiotics {{to reduce the risk}} of the bacteria developing antibiotic resistance. People with latent infections are also treated to prevent them from progressing to active TB disease later in life. Directly observed therapy, i.e., having a <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>provider</b> watch the person take their medications, is recommended by the WHO in an effort to reduce the number of people not appropriately taking antibiotics. The evidence to support this practice over people simply taking their medications independently is of poor quality. There is no strong evidence indicating that directly observed therapy improves the number of people who were cured or the number of people who complete their medicine. Moderate quality evidence suggests that there is also no difference if people are observed at home versus at a clinic, or by a family member versus a health care worker. Methods to remind people of the importance of treatment and appointments may result in a small but important improvement.|$|E

40|$|Aims: This study {{examined}} the perspectives and experiences of patients, parents, and <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>providers</b> with shared medical appointments (SMAs) for children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Specifically studied were reasons to attend SMAs, perceived differences between SMAs and individual medical appointments, patient-valued <b>health</b> <b>care</b> aspects, and providers' performance. Methods: Fifty-two patients, 8 parents, and 36 <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>providers</b> participated. Perspectives on SMAs were assessed with questionnaires and an online focus group. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: <b>Health</b> <b>care</b> <b>providers</b> had work-related reasons to conduct SMAs. Patients and parents primarily valued {{the presence of other}} patients during SMAs. According to <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>providers</b> and patients, a higher or similar amount of information was discussed during SMAs as opposed to individual appointments, respectively. SMAs did contain more discussion about lifestyle. Most consultation aspects considered important by the patients were performed by their <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>providers.</b> Patient satisfaction with SMAs did tend to decrease after 3 months. Parents were somewhat more critical about SMAs. Conclusions: <b>Health</b> <b>care</b> <b>providers,</b> patients, and parents were generally positive about SMAs. Future studies should examine the impact of the presence of parents and different <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>providers</b> during SMAs, and that of differences in patient age, type of insulin treatment, and disease-related problems.

40|$|In 2006, the Netherlands {{commenced}} market based {{reforms in}} its <b>health</b> <b>care</b> system. The reforms included selective contracting of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>providers</b> by <b>health</b> insurers. This paper focuses on how health insurers may increase their market share {{on the health}} insurance market through selective contracting of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>providers.</b> Selective contracting is studied by eliciting the preferences of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> consumers for attributes of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> services that an insurer could negotiate on behalf of its clients with <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>providers.</b> Selective contracting may provide incentives for <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>providers</b> to deliver the quality that consumers need and demand. Selective contracting also enables health insurers to steer individual patients towards selected <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>providers.</b> We used a stated preference technique known as a discrete choice experiment to collect and analyze the data. Results indicate that consumers care about both costs and quality of care, with healthy consumers placing greater emphasis on costs and consumers with poorer health placing greater emphasis on quality of care. It is possible for an insurer to satisfy both of these criteria by selective contracting <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>providers</b> who consequently purchase <b>health</b> <b>care</b> that is both efficient and of good quality...|$|R

A total of 36 voluntary oncology <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>providers</b> completed the cultural competence assessment survey. Participants were asked of their cultural awareness/sensitivity, cultural behaviors, previous experiences of diversity trainings, and some demographics questions. Descriptive (e. g. mean, frequency distributions) and inferential (e. g. t-test, one-way analysis of variance) statistics were used to analyze the data. Findings of the study showed that the levels of cultural competence among oncology <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>providers</b> were low to moderate. Oncology <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>providers</b> who were social workers and registered nurses tended to report more frequent culturally competent behaviors, compared to other career types of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>providers.</b> The study also found that those who had specific previous diversity training tended to report higher levels of cultural competence compared to those who did not have those diversity trainings.

40|$|Aim: To {{describe}} {{factors that}} influence collaboration between GPs and mental health professionals. Method: A survey conducted amongst 2757 GPs regarding collaboration, barriers regarding collaboration and task performance. Multiple regression analysis (stepwise) was performed to see which factores influence collaboration. Results: 1336 questionnaires were returned and 1196 questionnaires were analysed. Less {{than half of the}} GPs were informed about different aspects of specialised mental <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>providers.</b> Only a quarter or less of the GPs consulted frequently with the different mental <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>providers</b> but a quarter or more had never consulted with them. GPs experienced more barriers with specialised mental <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>providers</b> than with primary mental <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>providers.</b> Long waiting lists and insufficient possibilities for conjoint treatment were the most important barriers. Collaboration was enhanced by the presence of a contact person and the appreciation of information given by mental <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>providers.</b> Barriers associated with collaboration had a negative influence. Conclusion: Collaboration can be improved. To do so, information about mental <b>health</b> <b>care</b> towards GPs has to be improved as well as consultation with different mental <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>providers.</b> (aut. ref. ...|$|R

Of the 202 <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>providers,</b> 52 % reported that they knew how to use a computer, 48 % had access to a computer and 36 % reported that they didn't have access to internet services. Providers who knew how to use a computer were more likely to have access to health information (OR = 43. 3, 95 % CI: 17. 3, 111. 6). Thirty six percent of the providers reported that they sought the information to update their knowledge about diseases and new health technologies. Sources of information most preferred included textbooks (34. 1 %), colleagues (28. 8 %) and mobile telephones (21. 1 %).
