5|$|The Final Frontier was {{expected}} {{to be one of the}} summer's biggest movies and a sure hit, despite its appearing in a market crowded with other sequels and blockbusters such as Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Ghostbusters II and Batman. Never before <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> sequels been released at the same time. Analysts expected The Final Frontier to make nearly $200million.|$|E
5|$|In 1887 a Congressional Act {{divided the}} Eastern District into the Northern and Eastern Divisions of the Eastern District. The courts of the Eastern Division {{continued}} {{to be held at}} the U.S. Custom House and Post Office in St. Louis, while the courts of the Northern Division were moved to the U.S. Post Office at Hannibal, Missouri, where they met until 1960. These two courts, along with the four courts of the Western District, made six courts for the state, and at the time no other state <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> separate federal courts. The district has since been further divided into the Eastern, Northern, and Southeast divisions.|$|E

5|$|The bishop's {{violent death}} itself was nothing {{exceptional}} and {{could well have}} happened. Many bishops were murdered during the turmoils of the 12th and 13th centuries, although most were not elevated to sainthood. Saxo Grammaticus said of the Battle of Fotevik in 1134 that never <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> bishops been killed at the same time. Notable bishops that died violently included the Archbishop of Uppsala in 1187, Bishop of Estonia in 1219 and Bishop of Linköping in 1220.|$|E
5|$|The area {{in which}} the Flanders family's beach house is located in is based on the Cape Cod peninsula. Many of the writers of The Simpsons spent time on Cape Cod so they decided to model the new {{locations}} on it. The animators looked at Cape Cod photographs to get inspiration for the episode, and one of the show's background designers, Lance Wilder, grew up in that area. The beach house is based on then-show runner Josh Weinstein's parents' house in New Hampshire, to which the writers had visited many times. They played several board games when they were there, which gave them the idea to have to the Simpson family play the Mystery Date board game in the episode. Silverman said that the episode was difficult to animate and direct because it <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> new and detailed backgrounds and completely different locations.|$|E
5|$|The team took a brief hiatus after Brands Hatch, {{returning}} for Imola {{once again}} {{but they were}} unable to repeat their previous performance, both cars crashing out. Lancia once again skipped Fuji in Japan, returning for the South African round at Kyalami where Patrese and Nannini led home a 1-2 finish. Although the LC2 earned its second win, none of the leading Porsche teams attended the event in protest of the countries Apartheid laws. Unable to challenge further for the Constructors or Drivers Championships, the team did not attend the final round of the year at Sandown Park in Melbourne, Australia. Although the cars were fast, over the year Autocourse concluded that the team had <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> different problems that poor preparation must be the cause.|$|E

25|$|Collegiate wrestling, {{like its}} {{international}} counterpart, freestyle wrestling, has its main origins in catch-as-catch-can wrestling. In both styles, {{the ultimate goal}} is to pin the opponent to the mat, which results in an immediate win. Collegiate and freestyle wrestling, unlike Greco-Roman, also both allow the use of the wrestler's or his opponent's legs in offense and defense. However, collegiate wrestling has <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> influences from the wide variety of folk wrestling styles brought into the country that it has become distinctly American.|$|E

25|$|In 1857 {{at the age}} of 18 Busch emigrated {{with three}} of his older {{brothers}} to St. Louis, Missouri which was a major destination for German immigrants in the nineteenth century. Because he <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> siblings, Adolphus did not expect to inherit much of his father's estate and had to make his own way. Since St. Louis was home to so many German immigrants, the market for beer was large. The city also had two natural resources essential for manufacturing and storing beer before refrigeration: the river provided an ample water supply; and the city had many caves that would keep beer cool.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} the {{production}} restart, the U.S. Navy is expected to fall short of its requirement for 94 destroyer or cruiser platforms capable of missile defense starting in FY 2025 and continuing past {{the end of the}} 30-year planning window. While this is a new requirement as of 2011, and the U.S. Navy has never <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> large missile-armed surface combatants, the relative success of the Aegis ballistic missile defense system has shifted this national security requirement onto the U.S. Navy. The shortfall will arise as older platforms that have been refitted to be missile-defense-capable (particularly the cruisers) are retired in bulk before new destroyers are planned to be built.|$|E
25|$|Never before <b>had</b> <b>so</b> <b>many</b> violent (F4 and F5) tornadoes been {{observed}} in a single tornado outbreak. There were seven F5 tornadoes and 23 F4 tornadoes.

A tornado that struck near Monticello, Indiana was an F4 and had a path length of , the longest path length of any tornado for this outbreak. Nineteen {{people were killed in}} this tornado. The first F5 tornado of the day struck the city of Xenia, Ohio, at 4:40pm EDT. It killed 34, injured 1,150, completely destroyed about one-fourth of the city, and caused serious damage in another fourth of the city.|$|E
