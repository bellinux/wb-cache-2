6000|$|There is {{no doubt}} our present address, all round, lacked a little the easiest grace--or at least Louisa's and mine did. I felt too much the appeal of her {{exhibition}} to notice closely the style of encounter of the young people. I couldn't {{get it out of}} my head, as I have sufficiently indicated, that Mrs. Pallant was playing a game, and I'm afraid she saw in my face that this suspicion had been the motive of my journey. I had come there to find her out. The knowledge of my purpose couldn't help her to make me very welcome, and that's why I speak of our meeting constrainedly. We observed none the less all the forms, and the admirable scene left us plenty to talk about. I made no reference before Linda to the retreat from Homburg. This young woman looked even prettier than she had done on the eve of that manoeuvre and gave no sign of an awkward consciousness. She again so struck me as a charming clever girl that I was freshly puzzled to know why we should get--or should have got--into a tangle about her. People had to want to complicate a situation to do it on so simple a pretext as that Linda was in every way beautiful. This was the clear fact: so why shouldn't the presumptions be in favour of every result of it? One of the effects of that cause, on the spot, was {{that at the end of}} a very short time Archie proposed to her to take a turn with him in his boat, which awaited us at the foot of the steps. She looked at her mother with a smiling [...] "May I, mamma?" [...] and Mrs. Pallant answered [...] "Certainly, darling, if you're not afraid." [...] At this--I scarcely knew why--I sought the relief of laughter: it must have affected me as comic that the girl's <b>general</b> <b>competence</b> should suffer the imputation of that particular flaw. She gave me a quick slightly sharp look as she turned away with my nephew; it appeared to challenge me a little--"Pray what's the matter with YOU?" [...] It was the first expression of the kind I had ever seen in her face. Mrs. Pallant's attention, on the other hand, rather strayed from me; after we had been left there together she sat silent, not heeding me, looking at the lake and mountains--at the snowy crests crowned with the flush of evening. She seemed not even to follow our young companions as they got into their boat and pushed off. For some minutes I respected her mood; I walked slowly up and down the terrace and lighted a cigar, as she had always permitted me to do at Homburg. I found in her, it was true, rather a new air of weariness; her fine cold well-bred face was pale; I noted in it new lines of fatigue, almost of age. At last I stopped in front of her and--since she looked so sad--asked if she had been having bad news.|$|E

As an indicator for the <b>general</b> <b>competences</b> I use an average value of firms’ statements on apprentices’ written and oral skills, mathematical skills, problem solving skills, and basic IT-skills. The firms could rate each on a scale from − 2 “very bad” up to + 2 “very good”. As main result I find a positive correlation between <b>general</b> <b>competences</b> and the share of skilled work in firms of both training motives. Investing firms therefore reduce unproductive times while production oriented firms reduce the share of unskilled work.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we show that}} industry-based student {{training}} {{is not limited to}} work experience; work integrated learning, internship or extended vacation work. It is also about bringing back the lost parts of technological education. We experience the unilateral focus on theoretical knowledge at the expense of skills and <b>general</b> <b>competences</b> as one important challenge in technological education. The lacking facilitation and training of practical skills and <b>general</b> <b>competences</b> in the curricula and programs are identified, but many institutions have failed to address the problem. Today’s curricula in many ways reduce technology to abstract concepts, calculations and models, and create a gap between the academic programs and the practical applications in the society. We explore two (Australia and Norway) initiatives on industry-based student training and discuss how these initiatives address and bridge the gap. We argue that these initiatives of industry-based student training contribute to bringing skills and <b>general</b> <b>competences</b> back into technological education, and that the effects are not limited to increased employability, but also include increased academic performance...|$|R

Therefore, the need existed to examine the <b>general</b> global <b>competence</b> of students enrolling in international dimension (ID) courses at Oklahoma State University. This investigation was a census study; the target population included all undergraduate students (N = 147) enrolled in three ID courses offered in the College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources (CASNR) during the fall semester of the 2010 – 2011 academic year. General knowledge instruments were used to gather pretest and posttest data to measure differences. Although students’ post-course scores were higher than pre-course scores, their overall performance was below 60 %. This difference in knowledge gain connoting <b>general</b> global <b>competence</b> was statistically significant (p <. 05), but the corresponding effect size was small, which signaled little practical significance. Whether ID courses are an efficacious way of achieving substantial change in students’ <b>general</b> global <b>competence</b> remains an open question.

Unfortunately, young traffic casualties remain overrepresented in traffic reports, with single-bicycle crashes as principal cause in children. This correlational, cross-sectional study focuses on the association between cycling skills and two intrinsic characteristics: <b>general</b> motor <b>competence</b> and body mass index (BMI). Therefore, <b>general</b> motor <b>competence,</b> BMI and practical cycling competence were measured in 9 -year-old children (n = 40). Significant correlations were found between cycling skills and <b>general</b> motor <b>competence</b> (r = 0. 434, p <= 0. 01), and between cycling skills and BMI (r = - 0. 400, p <= 0. 05). A multiple regression analysis revealed that children's general motor quotient and BMI together predicted 19 % of cycling skill score.

50|$|Spanish {{has left}} a deep imprint on the lexicon and grammar of Pichi. Code-mixing is an {{integral}} part of the linguistic system of Pichi. The pervasive influence of Spanish on Pichi is for one part, the consequence of language policy. Since colonial rule, Spanish has remained the sole medium of instruction at all levels of the educational system (cf. e.g. Lipski 1991: 35-36). There is a widespread competence in different registers of Spanish by Pichi speakers in Malabo (cf. Lipski 1985, 1992). In Malabo, The acquisition of Spanish begins in early childhood, even for many working-class Equatoguineans with little or no school education. Equally, the burgeoning oil economy of Equatorial Guinea has led to increased urbanisation, extending multi-ethnic social networks and the spread of Pichi as a native language. In such a socio-economic environment and amidst a high <b>general</b> <b>competence</b> in the official language Spanish, code-mixing between Pichi and Spanish, rather than being exceptional, is consciously and confidently articulated in daily life.|$|E

40|$|The {{value of}} drama {{activities}} in language classes {{has been demonstrated}} for several years. Researchers have laid the stress on the motivation of learners who can express their creative fiber freely. Drama and drama activities promote the development of <b>general</b> <b>competences</b> {{along the lines of}} the Common European Framework for language learning. They help learners to broaden their knowledge on the world, to strengthen or acquire new skills and know-how, to consolidate their existential competences as well as their ability to learn. They also promote the improvement of communicative language competences (in terms of linguistic skills, sociolinguistic abilities and pragmatic capacities). They are particularly relevant in the context of an action-oriented approach to language learning for students in Business English. Putting them into realistic situations through drama activities facilitates their learning of English. However, it cannot be denied that the differences of capacities among learners might hamper their acknowledgment of all the benefits of drama. The increase of IT tools with a pedagogical purpose multiplies the strategies to strengthen the competences above mentioned. Therefore the creation of avatars on online games like Second Life might be an alternative to improve the learners' competences. In this paper, we shall study the complementary nature of drama activities and online games in terms of <b>general</b> <b>competences.</b> We shall then analyze the extent to which they both improve the communicative language competences.
