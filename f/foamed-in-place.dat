50|$|Garage doors can be {{made out}} of many materials, but steel, aluminum, wood, copper, glass, and vinyl (polyethylene) {{are the most popular}} materials. Some {{manufacturers}} incorporate <b>foamed-in-place</b> polyurethane insulation within the monolithic panel and sectional garage doors.|$|E
40|$|The problem: To {{develop a}} <b>foamed-in-place</b> {{refractory}} material {{that would provide}} good thermal insulation, mechanical support, and vibration shielding for enclosed objects at temperatures up to 30000 F. The preparation of conventional foamed refractory materials required long curing times (as much as 48 hours) and high temperatures (at least 700 F), rendering such materials unusable for in-place potting of heat-sensitive components. The solution: A foamed ceramic material that has the requisite thermal insulation and strength, and also displays other properties that suggest {{a wide range of}} applications...|$|E
40|$|There is a {{great need}} to develop new polymer foam systems that combine the {{advantages}} of polyurethane foams (low cost, ease of processing, desirable physical properties) with nonflammability and thermal stability which polyurethanes lack. In this project we address this need by synthesizing novel polymer networks with a substantial content of nonflammable elements. Specifically most of the pendant hydrogens have been eliminated (or replaced with fluorine), and a substantial fraction of the carbon atoms are replaced with oxygen, phosphorus, and nitrogen. Other elements such as Ca, Mg, Al, Sb, V, and B are also incorporated in the polymer network to enhance nonflammability. The selected phosphorus compounds are in their highest oxidation state (+ 5) and the nitrogen {{is present in the}} form of five or six-member heterocyclic rings. Following these guidelines, several rigid, semi-rigid, and flexible, <b>foamed-in-place</b> foams with outstanding nonflammability and thermal stability have been developed...|$|E
40|$|APA â€“ The Engineered Wood Association {{worked with}} the Structural Insulated Panel Association (SIPA) and the wood {{structural}} panel industry {{in the development of}} minimum design properties for the wood structural panel skins. Minimums were also established for adhesives and foam density. Using these industry-developed minimum properties for panels, adhesives and foam density, APA ran a series of tests on SIPs manufactured to reflect these minimums with an expanded polystyrene foam core. Tests included shear, axial, transverse, and SIPS lintel testing and results are published in APA Report No. T 2006 P- 33 and formed the basis for a series of prescriptive use requirements for a code change proposal for the International Residential Code. At the request of Ainsworth Engineered, (USA) LLC, Cook, Minnesota a similar series of tests was conducted on SIPs manufactured with BASF <b>foamed-in-place</b> polyurethane insulation. This testing was conducted to determine the design values appropriate for the SIPs manufactured with the polyurethane foam. Preliminary testing was conducted on panels manufactured with urethane foam cores with a density of 2. 0 lb/cu ft. This testing is reported in APA Report T 2007 P- 40. Additional transverse load testing on panels manufactured at the Ainswort...|$|E
