40|$|There {{is little}} {{published}} research that examines the supervision experience of <b>field</b> attachment <b>supervisors</b> in Kenya. In this study, we identify the challenges encountered by <b>field</b> <b>supervisors</b> during student <b>field</b> attachments with community organizations. Fifteen organizations that had hosted third year {{students from the}} Department of Community Resource Management and Extension (CRM&E) at Kenyatta University during their practicum attachment were sampled using purposive and convenience sampling. Data was collected using face-to-face key informant interviews with <b>field</b> <b>supervisors</b> (n= 15). Data was analyzed using NVivo 10 software for qualitative analysis. Thematic analysis resulted {{in the identification of}} key themes related to clarity of learning objectives for students and the supervision challenges encountered by <b>field</b> <b>supervisors</b> during practicum. Key findings indicate that the supervisors largely lacked a clear understanding of practicum expectations and the academic preparation of students in the Community Resource Management and Extension program. The main supervision challenge is largely on orienting students to community based field work so as to enable them link theory to practice. These results can be helpful for any academic program to improve the field attachment experience of university students and the community organizations hosting the students.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} <b>field</b> <b>supervisors</b> 2 ̆ 7 multicultural competence and {{the inclusion of}} multicultural and diversity issues in field supervision within masters 2 ̆ 7 degree counselor training programs. Changing demographics in the United States have necessitated that counseling {{move away from the}} ethnocentric framework that has dominated the field. Consequently, professional organizations and academic institutions now include a multicultural component to training. However, much counselor training takes place with <b>supervisors</b> in the <b>field,</b> many of whom were trained prior to multicultural and diversity issues being included in academic programs. ^ This study was designed to begin to address the scarcity of theoretical knowledge and the lack of empirical scholarship relating to multicultural supervision, by assessing <b>field</b> <b>supervisors</b> 2 ̆ 7 multicultural competency. It is hoped that this research will assist academic institutions in providing support and training opportunities for <b>field</b> <b>supervisors.</b> The Multicultural Counseling Competencies (Sue, Bernier, Durran, Feinberg, Pedersen, Smith, 2 ̆ 6 Vasquez-Nuttal, 1982; Sue, Arredondo, 2 ̆ 6 McDavis, 1992) were used as the theoretical model for measuring multicultural competence. Specifically, the Multicultural Counseling Inventory (MCI) (Sodowsky, Taffe, Gutkin, 2 ̆ 6 Wise, 1994) was used to asses the multicultural competence of counseling students 2 ̆ 7 <b>field</b> <b>supervisors,</b> and a researcher designed survey, the Questionnaire for <b>Field</b> <b>Supervisors,</b> (QFS) (Durham, 1999) was used to assess the inclusion of multicultural and diversity issues in the process of supervision. Selected demographic variables, including supervisors 2 ̆ 7 gender (Carter, 1990), race/ethnicity (Holcomb-McCoy 2 ̆ 6 Myers, 1999; Ponterotto 2 ̆ 6 Casas, 1987), exposure to diverse populations (Pope-Davis 2 ̆ 6 Ottavi, 1994; Sodowsky et al., 1991), years since graduate training (Ponterotto 2 ̆ 6 Casas, 1987), and formal training in supervision (Durham, 1999) which have been previously associated with multicultural competence were correlated with the <b>field</b> <b>supervisors</b> 2 ̆ 7 multicultural competence and the inclusion of multicultural issues in supervision. ^ The study indicates that multicultural training, (e. g. formal course work, seminars, and workshops) increases supervisors 2 ̆ 7 multicultural competence as indicated by MCI Total, Awareness, and Knowledge scores. Also, the inclusion of multicultural issues within supervision is related to multicultural competence, again as measured by the MCI. And finally, being female and professional employment in a multiculturally diverse geographic area is correlated with the Multicultural Awareness, Knowledge and Skills MCI scores. ...|$|R

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Federal law does not mandate specific qualifications for individuals appointed as U. S. Marshals. However, Section 505 of the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 states that U. S. Marshals should possess certain minimum characteristics in order to serve. The suggested characteristics are (1) a minimum of 4 years of command-level law enforcement management duties, including personnel, budget, and accountable property issues, in a police department, sheriff's office, or federal law enforcement agency; (2) experience in coordinating with other law enforcement agencies, particularly {{at the state and}} local levels; (3) college-level academic experience; and (4) experience in or with county, state, and federal court systems or experience with protection of court personnel, jurors, and witnesses. In contrast to the appointment process for U. S. Marshals, the senior <b>field</b> <b>supervisors</b> of other federal law enforcement agencies with comparable duties and responsibilities are selected under competitive, merit-based promotion criteria outlined in Title 5 of the U. S. Code. These individuals are required to apply and compete for these positions and meet any identified minimum standards. Minimum qualifications used to select senior <b>field</b> <b>supervisors</b> at some of the federal law enforcement agencies vary, but all require prior supervisory law enforcement experience. In April 2003, we reported on the appointment and qualifications of U. S. Marshals at which time there were no statutory provisions on the suggested minimum characteristics of U. S. Marshals. We also reported that while the average length of overall law enforcement experience of U. S. Marshals was not significantly different than that of senior <b>field</b> <b>supervisors</b> at the three selected federal law enforcement agencies, the level of government (federal, state, local, or county level) from which the experience was obtained differed. With passage of the act, Congress requested that we address the following questions (1) To what extent do the U. S. Marshals possess the four suggested minimum characteristics included in Section 505 of the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 ? (2) To what extent are the U. S. Marshals' experience, education, race, and gender comparable to those of senior <b>field</b> <b>supervisors</b> in other federal law enforcement agencies?...|$|R

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2013. Includes bibliographical references. The special {{education}} teacher shortage prompted school districts to hire unlicensed teachers on the condition they earn their credentials on-the-job (in place). Although the benefits of traditional student teaching is well documented, {{little is known about}} how in place arrangements prepare individuals for teaching {{special education}}. Given that large numbers of unlicensed teacher candidates are hired to teach children with disabilities annually, it is important to investigate how the in place student teaching arrangement prepares individuals to teach children with disabilities. This qualitative study explored the perceptions of ethnically diverse, recently graduated traditional and in place candidates on how their student teaching arrangements prepared them to teach special education. Four research questions guided this study: (a) What are the perceptions of recently graduated in place/traditional {{special education teacher}} candidates on their student teaching experiences? (b) To what extent do teacher candidates believe student teaching experiences contributed to their success/challenges in the classroom? (c) Are there any significant differences in the perceptions of former traditional and in place candidates regarding their special education teacher preparation program? (d) What are the perceptions of experienced <b>field</b> <b>supervisors</b> regarding the traditional and in place student teaching experiences? Qualitative grounded theory methodology was used to analyze data and generate theory based on interviews with recently graduated teacher candidates and their university <b>field</b> <b>supervisors</b> from the Master of Education in Special Education Department at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Findings suggest the following: (a) traditional teacher candidates felt well prepared teach special education but unprepared for care coordination duties; (b) in place candidates reported feeling well prepared for both the teaching and care coordination responsibilities; and (c) <b>field</b> <b>supervisors</b> resoundingly supported traditional placements for all teacher candidates but also recognized the viability of in place teaching arrangements in preparing select candidates for special education...|$|R
