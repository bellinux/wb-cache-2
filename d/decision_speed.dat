40|$|The {{effects of}} age of {{acquisition}} (AoA) {{in the first}} (L 1) and second (L 2) languages of Spanish–English bilinguals were explored using a translation judgement task in which participants decided whether or not pairs of words in the two languages were translations of each other (i. e., had the same meaning). Experiment 1 found an effect of second language AoA on decision latencies which interacted significantly with first language AoA such that first language AoA only affected translation when the second language word in the pair was early acquired. It was hypothesised that slow processing of late acquired L 2 words could have masked the AoA effect of the first language in Experiment 1. Analysis of lexical <b>decision</b> <b>speeds</b> in Experiment 2 lent support to this hypothesis. Experiment 2 also found lexical <b>decision</b> <b>speeds</b> in Spanish (L 1) to be predicted by Spanish AoA and word frequency while lexical <b>decision</b> <b>speeds</b> in English (L 2) were predicted by English (not Spanish) AoA, English word frequency and word length.

50|$|Regulations {{governing}} the required thrust levels for transport aircraft are typically {{based upon the}} requirement that an aircraft {{be able to continue}} a takeoff if an engine fails after the takeoff <b>decision</b> <b>speed</b> is reached. Thus, with all engines operating, trijets must be able to produce at least 150% of the minimum thrust required to climb and quad-jets 133%. Conversely, since a twinjet will lose half of its total thrust if an engine fails, they are required to produce 200% of the minimum thrust required to climb when both engines are operating. Because of this, twinjets will typically have higher thrust-to-weight ratios than aircraft with three or more engines and are thus able to accelerate and climb faster.|$|E

40|$|There is {{considerable}} evidence (e. g., Pexman et al., 2008) that semantically rich words, which {{are associated with}} relatively more semantic information, are recognized faster across different lexical processing tasks. The present study extends this earlier work by providing the most comprehensive evaluation to date of semantic richness effects on visual word recognition performance. Specifically, using mixed effects analyses to control for the influence of correlated lexical variables, we considered the impact of number of features, number of senses, semantic neighborhood density, imageability, and body–object interaction across five visual word recognition tasks: standard lexical decision, go/no-go lexical <b>decision,</b> <b>speeded</b> pronunciation, progressive demasking, and semantic classification. Semantic richness effects could be reliably detected in all tasks of lexical processing, indicating that semantic representations, particularly their imaginal and featural aspects, play {{a fundamental role in}} visual word recognition.

40|$|Multimodal {{signals are}} common in nature and have {{recently}} attracted considerable attention. Despite this interest, their function is not well understood. We test the hypothesis that multimodal signals improve decision making in receivers by influencing the speed and the accuracy of their decisions. We trained bumble-bees (Bombus impatiens) to discriminate between artificial flowers that differed either in one modality, visual (specifically, shape) or olfactory, or in two modalities, visual plus olfactory. Bees trained on multimodal flowers learned the rewarding flowers faster than those trained on flowers that differed only in the visual modality and, in extinction trials, visited the previously rewarded flowers {{at a higher rate}} than bees trained on unimodal flowers. Overall, bees showed a speed–accuracy trade-off; bees that made slower decisions achieved higher accuracy levels. Foraging on multimodal flowers did not affect the slope of the speed–accuracy relationship, but resulted in a higher intercept, indicating that multimodal signals were associated with consistently higher accuracy across range of <b>decision</b> <b>speeds.</b> Our results suggest that bees make more effective decisions when flowers signal in more than one modality, and confirm the importance of studying signal components together rather than separately...|$|R

40|$|Rapid {{technological}} innovation, shortening {{product life}} cycles, and increasingly fierce competition place great pressure on top managers to execute rapid strategic change. A key question in strategic management though, is whether <b>decision</b> <b>speed</b> helps or harms {{the quality of}} top management team strategic decision-making? There {{is a shortage of}} theory and evidence concerning the consequences of <b>decision</b> <b>speed</b> across different environmental contexts, owing to prior research focusing solely on the effects of speed in dynamic environments.

We do so because environments are multidimensional, and an environment which is dynamic and hostile is very different to one which is dynamic and munificent. Analyzing dyadic data from multiple top managers on 117 strategic decisions, we demonstrate that <b>decision</b> <b>speed</b> has both positive and negative effects on decision quality according to different combinations of environmental hostility, munificence, and dynamism.

40|$|The {{purposes}} {{of the present study}} were to determine which aspects of processing speed are affected in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and which cognitive and motoric skills predict processing speed performance.

40|$|The {{survival}} of animals depends critically on prioritizing responses to motivationally salient stimuli. While {{it is generally}} believed that motivational salience increases <b>decision</b> <b>speed,</b> the quantitative relationship between motivational salience and <b>decision</b> <b>speed,</b> measured by reaction time (RT), remains unclear. Here we show that the neural correlate of motivational salience in the basal forebrain (BF), defined independently of RT, is coupled with faster and also more precise <b>decision</b> <b>speed.</b> In rats performing a reward-biased simple RT task, motivational salience was encoded by BF bursting response that occurred before RT. We found that faster RTs were tightly coupled with stronger BF motivational salience signals. Furthermore, the fraction of RT variability reflecting the contribution of intrinsic noise {{in the decision-making process}} was actively suppressed in faster RT distributions with stronger BF motivational salience signals. Artificially augmenting the BF motivational salience signal via electrical stimulation led to faster and more precise RTs and supports a causal relationship. Together, these results not only describe for the first time, to our knowledge, the quantitative relationship between motivational salience and faster <b>decision</b> <b>speed,</b> they also reveal the quantitative coupling relationship between motivational salience and more precise RT. Our results further establish the existence of an early and previously unrecognized step in the decision-making process that determines both the RT speed and variability of the entire decision-making process and suggest that this novel decision step is dictated largely by the BF motivational salience signal. Finally, our study raises the hypothesis that the dysregulation of <b>decision</b> <b>speed</b> in conditions such as depression, schizophrenia, and cognitive aging may result from the functional impairment of the motivational salience signal encoded by the poorly understood noncholinergic BF neurons...|$|E

We rigorously test the assumption that emphasizing <b>decision</b> <b>speed</b> versus decision accuracy selectively influences only decision thresholds. In data from a new brightness discrimination experiment we found that emphasizing <b>decision</b> <b>speed</b> over decision accuracy not only decreases the amount of evidence required for a decision but also decreases the quality of information being accumulated during the decision process.

40|$|Modelling {{network-centric warfare}} {{is likely to}} require a higher {{fidelity}} of representation of decisionmaking processes than previous military modelling tasks. This report surveys recent research on decision making and distils from this a proposed modelling framework. The military decision-making process is typically conceptualised as cyclic; the OODA (observe–orient–decide–act) loop being perhaps the best known example in military circles. Decisions can be classified by the particular parts of an elaborated decision-making loop involved, {{but it is more}} useful for modelling purposes to classify decisions by the cognitive resources involved, leading to the types ‘recognition primed decisions’, requiring few if any cognitive resources, and ‘analytical decisions’, which are heavily dependent on attention and working memory. Working from this view, we propose that it is sufficient to describe either type of decision making with just two characteristics: speed and soundness. Speed is defined in terms of the time taken to carry out certain parts of the decision-making loop. We argue that soundness—more precisely, relative soundness—must be judged by reference to the prevailing commander’s intent, a concept that is discussed in some detail. The model must also take into account what is known of how humans function as decision makers; this is surveyed and summarised.
