Number of jackals has grown quickly in coastal areas of Estonia. In 2016 jackals killed over 100 sheep in Estonia and during hunting season in winter 2016/2017 32 jackals were killed.

Although it was filmed during the first season, [...] "Unearthed" [...] aired during the following season on Monday, January 11, 2010, a departure from its normal timeslot on Thursdays. Actor Joshua Jackson explained the move in April 2009, [...] " [...] for boring reasons. They only had 22 airdates for our show this year, but they ordered 23 episodes, so we shot one <b>for</b> <b>next</b> <b>year,</b> which is just silly TV network stuff. It's not for any cool reason like we had something we needed in New York that we couldn't shoot elsewhere. It's just an accounting issue." [...] That same month, executive producer/showrunner Jeff Pinkner further commented on the episode chronology for the new season, [...] "It won't be the first episode, and it probably won't be the second, but it'll be somewhere in the first batch of episodes. It's a stand-alone, but it still honors the condition that we know it will fall into the world." ...|$|E

[...] Over the next two months, the band worked to complete the album with Arnold Lanni at Arnyard Studios in Toronto as well as Avatar Studios in New York City. Rumors had surfaced that, while in New York, Our Lady peace had dropped Lanni as producer to work with The Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan. These rumors were later debunked by Maida.

2500|$|In early autumn, they {{collected}} deadfall and prepared supplies of firewood; while winters were mild {{on the coast}} they could be brutal in the highlands. Farmers also had to break the hard crust that had formed over the summer on grain fields. To do this required three passes since the ard was wooden (metal shares were rare) and only scratched the uppermost subsoil without inverting it. A hoe and mallet were also used to break clumps of earth. The fallow land <b>for</b> <b>next</b> <b>year</b> was sown by hand.
