5|$|When {{thermoplastics}} are moulded, typically pelletised {{raw material}} is fed through a hopper into a heated barrel with a reciprocating screw. Upon {{entrance to the}} barrel, the temperature increases and the Van der Waals forces that resist relative flow of individual chains are weakened {{as a result of}} increased space between molecules at higher thermal energy states. This process reduces its viscosity, which enables the polymer to flow with the driving force of the injection unit. The screw delivers the raw material forward, mixes and homogenises the thermal and viscous distributions of the polymer, and reduces the required heating time by mechanically shearing the material and adding a significant amount of frictional heating to the polymer. The material feeds forward through a check valve and collects {{at the front of the}} screw into a volume known as a shot. A shot is the volume of material that is used to fill the mould cavity, compensate for shrinkage, and provide a cushion (approximately 10% of the total shot volume, which remains in the barrel and prevents the screw from bottoming out) to transfer pressure from the screw to the mould cavity. When enough material has gathered, the material is forced at high pressure and velocity into the part forming cavity. To prevent spikes in pressure, the process normally uses a transfer position corresponding to a 95–98% full cavity where the screw shifts from a constant velocity to a constant pressure control. Often injection times are well under 1 second. Once the screw reaches the transfer position the packing pressure is applied, which completes mould filling and compensates for thermal shrinkage, which is quite high for thermoplastics relative to many other materials. The packing pressure is applied until the gate (cavity entrance) solidifies. Due to its small size, the gate is normally the first place to solidify through its entire thickness. Once the gate solidifies, no more material can enter the cavity; accordingly, the screw reciprocates and acquires material for the next cycle while the material within the mould cools so that it can be ejected and be <b>dimensionally</b> <b>stable.</b> This cooling duration is dramatically reduced by the use of cooling lines circulating water or oil from an external temperature controller. Once the required temperature has been achieved, the mould opens and an array of pins, sleeves, strippers, etc. are driven forward to demould the article. Then, the mould closes and the process is repeated.|$|E

Although its wood is commonly knotty and twisted, straight-grained Osage orange timber makes very good bows. In Arkansas, {{in the early}} 19th century, a good Osage bow was worth a horse and a blanket. Additionally, a yellow-orange dye can be extracted from the wood, {{which can be used}} as a substitute for fustic and aniline dyes.

25|$|Sodium {{borosilicate}} glass, Pyrex: silica + boron trioxide (B2O3) + soda (Na2O) + alumina (Al2O3). Stands {{heat expansion}} {{much better than}} window glass. Used for chemical glassware, cooking glass, car head lamps, etc. Borosilicate glasses (e.g. Pyrex, Duran) have as main constituents silica and boron trioxide. They have fairly low coefficients of thermal expansion (7740 Pyrex CTE is 3.25/°C as compared to about 9/°C for a typical soda-lime glass), making them more <b>dimensionally</b> <b>stable.</b> The lower {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (CTE) also makes them less subject to stress caused by thermal expansion, thus less vulnerable to cracking from thermal shock. They are commonly used for reagent bottles, optical components and household cookware.|$|E
5000|$|A poor fit of {{the action}} to the stock is also a source of problems, and this problem is {{exacerbated}} by issues such as thermal expansion of metal parts during use, and swelling and contracting of wooden stocks with changes in humidity. These changes can affect accuracy either by allowing the action to shift under recoil, or by causing slight but accuracy-destroying bending of the barrel. By removing wood from areas of contact and, when needed, {{replacing it with a}} more stable substance that is precisely fitted, such as a fiberglass composite molded in place, a more stable, precise fit can be achieved. [...] Other materials, such as composites or laminated wood, can also provide a stronger, more <b>dimensionally</b> <b>stables</b> stock than traditional woods can.

500|$|Sustainability {{of such a}} tall {{building}} {{would include}} issues such as vertical transportation limitations, with elevators only {{being able to go}} so far, building sway, caused by wind, and supercolumn settling, which occurs because concrete tends to shrink as it hydrates and settles under load, whereas steel is <b>dimensionally</b> <b>stable,</b> thereby causing the floors to become unlevel. Additionally, a very large core size is required in very tall buildings to support the structure as well as to house the large number of elevators needed. The core size consumes a significant amount of the space on the lower and middle floors. One of the ways Jeddah Tower attempts to overcome these issues is with its smooth, sloped-exterior design, which, although more expensive to build, offers superior aerodynamic performance over [...] "stepped" [...] designs such as the Burj Khalifa, allowing it to have a more conservative core overall. This was determined by wind tunnel tests performed at Burj Khalifa. Jeddah Tower will also utilize copious stiffening materials to prevent the excessive sway that would otherwise make the occupants of upper floors nauseated on windy days, including very high strength concrete that will be up to several metres thick in certain parts of the core. This, along with the highly integrated steel frame and shear walls, is also intended to prevent catastrophic failure of the structure {{in the event of a}} terrorist attack. Traditionally, the space consumed by elevators was considered to make a building become increasingly less profitable past 80 floors or so. More recently, it has been the advent of truly mixed-use design such as Shanghai Tower and Burj Khalifa, as well as improved building technology, that have outdated this rule of thumb, which generally applied to single use buildings.|$|E

Our setup is an improvement of the existing facility at room temperature and allows to define CTEs at the temperature range from 100 K to 300 K.

A precision dilatometer consists of a main body and a flexible bag cell, in which a counter electrode is selected to be the zero-strain insertion electrode of lithium titanium oxide (LTO: Li[Li 1 / 3 Ti 5 / 3]O 4). Change in thickness of the cell consisting of a target electrode and an LTO electrode is measured in a sub-micron scale as a function of area-specific capacity stored or delivered electricity in mAh cm− 2, and the area-specific deformation in μm / (mAh cm− 2) is defined as a common measure to evaluate the deformation or swelling of the electrodes.

This study investigated the strength development and weathering properties of steam- and CO 2 -cured full size lightweight concrete blocks. Some freshly molded lightweight concrete blocks were taken from a block manufacture plant and cured in a CO 2 curing tank in lab. Steam-cured lightweight concrete blocks were randomly taken from the same plant. Several hundreds of concrete blocks after steam and CO 2 curing were stockpiled outside for winter exposure. The compressive strength of CO 2 -cured blocks was similar to that of steam-cured ones. It continued to increase when blocks were placed in a moist environment after steam and CO 2 curing. However, steam-cured blocks showed faster strength development rate than CO 2 -cured ones did, and they behaved the same during the outdoor winter exposure, CO 2 -cured blocks demonstrated lower drying shrinkage and water absorption than steam-cured ones after 180 days of outdoor winter exposure. This indicated that CO 2 -cured concrete blocks had better dimensional stability, but similar weathering properties to steam-cured ones. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|MDF of blowline glued pine pulp with {{different}} ram densites were tested on the physical-mechanical short-term properties {{as well as}} on the form stability and the creep behaviour. The results were evaluated regarding the influence of the raw density profile perpendicular to the panel surface. The creep behaviour has been tested with use- oriented loaf based on DIN 68874 1 as well as with strength of an applied bending strength better then the MDF panels with an even raw density profile. This results in the better creep behaviour of the panels with the distinctive raw density profile. Thie higher creepage of the mouldable MDF (even raw density profile) can be reduced by increasing the panel thickness. The strength-oriented loading of the MDF panels with 25 % of their breaking load, led to an disproportional high creepage with no practical relevance. The use-oriented load is advantage-ously related to the expectable working load in use. A direct comparison of the creep behaviour of all test specimen is applicable since all are applied with the same load. Regarding the level of lod is to be proposed: test load = safety factor x to be expected maximum working load, e. g. 5 x L 125 according to DIN 68874 - 1.
