40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{whether the}} ecosystem service of animal production from grasslands depends upon <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> identity, <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> diversity {{or if the}} resilience of production {{is a function of}} this diversity. Using the results of nine grazing experiments the paper shows that productivity is highly dependent on one leaf trait, leaf dry matter content, as well as rainfall. Animal (secondary) productivity is not dependent on <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> diversity, but the variability in productivity of grasslands is related to the functional diversity of leaf dry matter content. This and a range of independent studies have shown that functional diversity is reduced at high levels of grassland productivity, so it appears that there is a trade-off between productivity and the resilience of productivity in the face of environmental variation...|$|R

40|$|Predicting {{climate change}} impact on {{ecosystem}} structure and services {{is one of}} the most important challenges in ecology. Until now, plant species response to climate change has been described at the level of fixed <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> types, an approach limited by its inflexibility as there is much interspecific <b>functional</b> variation within <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> types. Considering a plant species as a set of functional traits greatly increases our possibilities for analysis of ecosystem functioning and carbon and nutrient fluxes associated therewith. Moreover, recently assembled large-scale databases hold comprehensive per-species data on <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> traits, allowing a detailed functional description of many plant communities on Earth. Here, we show that <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> traits can be used as predictors of vegetation response to climate warming, accounting in our test ecosystem (the species-rich alpine belt of Caucasus mountains, Russia) for 59 % of variability in the per-species abundance relation to temperature. In this mountain belt, traits that promote conservative leaf water economy (higher leaf mass per area, thicker leaves) and large investments in belowground reserves to support next year's shoot buds (root carbon content) were the best predictors of the species increase in abundance along with temperature increase. This finding demonstrates that <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> traits constitute a highly useful concept for forecasting changes in plant communities, and their associated ecosystem services, in response to climate change...|$|R
40|$|We {{experimentally}} {{separated the}} effects of two components of plant diversity—plant species richness and <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> group richness—on insect communities. Plant species richness and <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> group richness had contrasting effects on insect abundances, a result we attributed to three factors. First, lower insect abundances at higher <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> group richness were explained by a sampling effect, which {{was caused by the}} increasing likelihood that one low-quality group, C 4 grasses, would be present and reduce average insect abundances by 25 %. Second, plant biomass, which was positively related to <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> group richness, had a strong, positive effect on insect abundances. Third, a positive effect of plant species richness on insect abundances may have been caused by greater availability of alternate plant resources or greater vegetational structure. In addition, a greater diversity of insect species, whose individual abundances were often unaffected by changes in plant species richness, may have generated higher total community abundances. After controlling for the strong, positive influence of insect abundance on insect diversity through rarefaction, insect species richness increased as plant species richness and <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> group richness increased. Although these variables did not explain a high proportion of variation individually, plant species richness and <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> group richness had similar effects on insect diversity and opposing effects on insect abundances, and both factors may explain how the loss of plant diversity influences higher trophic levels...|$|R

40|$|A new {{evapotranspiration}} {{package for}} the U. S. Geological Survey's groundwater -flow model, MODFLOW, is documented. The Riparian Evapotranspiration Package (RIP-ET), provides flexibility in simulating riparian and wetland evapotranspiration (ET) not provided by the MODFLOW- 96 Evapotranspiration (EVT) Package, nor by the MODFLOW- 2000 Segmented Function Evapotranspiration (ETS 1) Package. This report describes how the package was conceptualized and provides input instructions, listings and explanations of the source code, and an example simulation. Traditional approaches to modeling ET processes assume a piecewise linear relationship between ET flux rate and hydraulic head. The Riparian ET Package replaces this traditional relationship with a segmented, nonlinear dimensionless curve that reflects the eco-physiology of riparian and wetland ecosystems. Evapotranspiration losses from these ecosystems are dependent not only on hydraulic head but on the plant types present. User-defined <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> groups (PFGs) are used to elucidate the interactive processes of plant ET with groundwater conditions. Five generalized <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> groups based on transpiration rates, plant rooting depth, and drought tolerance are presented: obligate wetland, shallow-rooted riparian, deep-rooted riparian, transitional riparian and bare ground/open water. <b>Plant</b> <b>functional</b> groups can be further divided into subgroups (PFSG) based on plant size and/or density. The Riparian ET Package allows for partial habitat coverage and mixtures of <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> subgroups {{to be present in}} a single model cell. This requires a determination of fractional coverage for each of the <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> subgroups present in a cell to simulate the mixture of coverage types and resulting ET. The fractional cover within a cell has three components: 1) fraction of active habitat, 2) fraction of <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> subgroup in a cell, and 3) fraction of plant canopy area. The Riparian ET package determines the ET rate for each <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> group in a cell, the total ET in the cell, and the total ET rate over the region of simulation...|$|R

40|$|The {{question}} {{addressed in}} this paper is whether plant traits and <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> types related to forage selection by grazers are also related to those expressing short-term community response after grazing. Vegetation of natural campos grassland in south Brazil was examined for species composition and locally described for seven morphological traits before and after a controlled grazing period by bovine cattle.

The results have shown that plant traits optimally defining plant types related to forage selection (PFef Ts) were the same traits optimally defining short-term community response to grazing (PFre Ts); also similar trends of plant morphological variation were observed among populations before and after grazing, based on the traits’ correlation structure. However, at the community level the correlation vanished, since similar communities described by the performances of PFef Ts were not as similar when described by PFre Ts. Hence, whether <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> types related to forage selection (effect types) are also related to community response to grazing may depend on the level of organization considered.

40|$|The global {{geographic}} {{distribution of}} biodiversity and biomes {{is determined by}} species-specific physiological tolerances to climatic constraints. Current models implement empirical bioclimatic relationships to predict present-day vegetation patterns and to forecast biodiversity changes and biome shifts under climatic change. In this paper, we consider <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> trade-offs and their interactions with climatic changes to forecast and explain biodiversity changes and biome shifts. The Jena Diversity model (JeDi) simulates plant survival according to essential <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> trade-offs, including eco-physiological processes such as water uptake, photosynthesis, allocation, reproduction and phenology. We apply JeDi to quantify biodiversity changes and biome shifts between present-day {{and a range of}} possible future climates from two scenarios (A 2 and B 1) and seven global climate models using metrics of <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> richness and functional identity. Our results show (i) a significant biodiversity loss in the tropics, (ii) an increase in biodiversity at mid and high latitudes, and (iii) a poleward shift of biomes. While these results are consistent with the findings of empirical approaches, we are able to explain them in terms of the <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> trade-offs involved in the allocation, metabolic and reproduction strategies of plants.

40|$|The rate {{at which}} a plant species is {{attacked}} by invertebrate herbivores has been hypothesized to depend on plant species richness, yet empirical evidence is scarce. Current theory predicts higher herbivore damage in monocultures than in species-rich mixtures. We quantified herbivore damage by insects and molluscs to plants in experimental plots established in 2002 from a species pool of 60 species of Central European Arrhenatherum grasslands. Plots differed in plant species richness (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 60 species), number of functional groups (1, 2, 3, 4), functional group and species composition. We estimated herbivore damage by insects and molluscs {{at the level of}} transplanted plant individuals ("phytometer" species Plantago lanceolata, Trifolium pratense, Rumex acetosa) and of the entire plant community during 2003 and 2004. In contrast to previous studies, our design allows specific predictions about the relative contributions of <b>functional</b> diversity, <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> identity, and species richness in relation to herbivory. Additionally, the phytometer approach is new to biodiversity-herbivory studies, allowing estimates of species-specific herbivory rates within the larger biodiversity-ecosystem functioning context. Herbivory in phytometers and experimental communities tended to increase with plant species richness and the number of <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> groups, but the effects were rarely significant. Herbivory in phytometers was in some cases positively correlated with community biomass or leaf area index. The most important factor influencing invertebrate herbivory was the presence of particular <b>plant</b> <b>functional</b> groups.
