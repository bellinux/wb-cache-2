Eventually IBM introduced a <b>dictating</b> <b>machine</b> using an erasable belt made of magnetic tape which enabled the user to correct dictation errors rather than marking errors on a paper tab. Dictaphone in turn added magnetic recording models while still selling the models recording on the Lexan belts. Machines based on magnetic tape recording were introduced in the late seventies, initially using the standard compact (or [...] "C") cassette, but soon, in dictation machines, using mini-cassettes or microcassettes instead.

30|$|Distributed layout {{has emerged}} as an {{alternative}} to conventional layouts. In a distributed layout, similar departments (machines) are distributed throughout the factory floor to increase access to these resources from different regions of the layout (Baykasoglu 2003). This type of layout minimizes material handling costs because it enables the identification of efficient routes for a large number of product mixes. The idea to disaggregate functional departments into individual machines and maximize distribution by placing them as far from each other as possible was first proposed by Montreuil and Venkatadri (1991). Urban and Russel (2000) proposed a model that does not require machines to be placed in a functional layout or in a cellular arrangement, but instead allows material flow requirements to <b>dictate</b> <b>machine</b> placement. Benjaafar and Sheikhzadeh (2000) explored layout configuration in stochastic environments and showed that there is a value in creating replicates of the same department and distributing them throughout the plant floor. Drolet (1989) investigated a distributed layout configuration where virtual cells are formed and temporarily devoted to job orders. The application of distributed layout in virtual cellular manufacturing systems was also illustrated in Baykasoglu (2003). Lahmer and Benjaafar (2005) presented a procedure for the design of distributed layouts in settings with multiple periods where product demand and product mix may vary from period to period. Using simulation, Krishnan et al. (2009) analyzed several performance parameters in distributed layouts under stochastic conditions.|$|R

50|$|This period {{also saw}} several other {{historic}} developments including {{the introduction of}} the first practical magnetic sound recording system, the magnetic wire recorder, which was {{based on the work of}} Danish inventor Valdemar Poulsen. Magnetic wire recorders were effective, but the sound quality was poor, so between the wars, they were primarily used for voice recording and marketed as business dictating machines. In 1924, a German engineer, Dr. Kurt Stille, developed the Poulsen wire recorder as a <b>dictating</b> <b>machine.</b> The following year, Ludwig Blattner began work that eventually produced the Blattnerphone, enhancing it to use steel tape instead of wire. The BBC started using Blattnerphones in 1930 to record radio programmes. In 1933, radio pioneer Guglielmo Marconi's company purchased the rights to the Blattnerphone, and newly developed Marconi-Stille recorders were installed in the BBC's Maida Vale Studios in March 1935. The tape used in Blattnerphones and Marconi-Stille recorders was the same material used to make razor blades, and not surprisingly the fearsome Marconi-Stille recorders were considered so dangerous that technicians had to operate them from another room for safety. Because of the high recording speeds required, they used enormous reels about one metre in diameter, and the thin tape frequently broke, sending jagged lengths of razor steel flying around the studio. The K1 Magnetophon was the first practical tape recorder, developed by AEG in Germany in 1935.|$|E

The bachelor thesis {{is presented as a}} monographic study so it describes only the issues relating to ČDPH. It is divided into two parts the theoretical and the research one. In the theoretical part I describe ČDPH in more detail as a healthcare facility, and mention its operation and medical care system. I also examine the personality of a social worker. In the broadest context possible I try to depict topics relating to the competences and position of social workers. The objective of the thesis is to define the competences and position of social workers in the medical care system in ČDPH. In order to fulfil the objective of the thesis, I set two research questions: 1. What are the competences and position of a social worker in the medical care system in ČDPH? 2. What is the position of a social worker in the medical care system in ČDPH? The research is divided into two parts. The first part is focused on interviews with two social workers concerning their competences in ČDPH, while {{the other part of the}} research is focused on interviews concerning the position of social workers. The interviews took place with the consent of both social workers and the director of the hospital. For the sake of better quality of data recording I used a <b>dictating</b> <b>machine,</b> and processed the collected data in electronic form afterwards. To interpret the results, I found table processing to be the most suitable method because of clear arrangement of the results. The research made it possible to answer both the research questions set beforehand. It has followed from the research that the competences of social workers in ČDPH include a broad complex of skills they should possess. They should be well versed in a number of branches of law, be aware of the basic rules of crisis intervention and have very good communication skills utilized especially in communication with patients. As far as the position of social workers in ČDPH is concerned, it has been ascertained that they find their position in ČDPH to be good and that they feel being full-fledged members of the multidisciplinary team of workers. They have freedom to decide to a certain degree but if a patient's situation requires so, the situation is discussed and solved by the team. Even the most complicated or crisis situations can always be jointly solved even based on a compromise. The bachelor thesis could be beneficial for both social workers as well as for me because of the realization of one's own current competences and possibilities of further improvement of some of them. The competences and position are specific to a certain degree with regard to the environment of the psychiatric hospital and its target group...|$|E

Specifically, by replacing the keyboard and mouse with a gesture and speech recognition system, we can develop more "natural" controls for numerous applications. In this paper we explore the use of speech and gesture modalities in a display control application.

A scheduling policy <b>dictates</b> whether the <b>machine</b> is idle or busy, and specifies the job class to serve in the latter case.

We develop index policies to decide which class to serve, including Whittle's "restless bandit" index, which possesses a certain asymptotic optimality. Several idleness policies, which are characterized by hedging points, are derived, and the best policy is obtained from a heavy traffic diffusion approximation.

40|$|In the min-max loop layout problem, {{machines}} {{are to be}} arranged around a loop of conveyor belt.

The goal is to find an ordering of the machines that minimises {{the maximum number of}} circuits required for the manufacture of any of the products. Since the problem is strongly NP-hard, the study of heuristic methods is of interest. This paper proposes iterated descent and tabu search algorithms, and a randomised insertion algorithm. Results of extensive computational tests show that all of our algorithms outperform a previously known algorithm that applies a greedy heuristic to the solution of a linear programming relaxation. The best quality solutions are obtained with iterated descent. This adds further evidence to the belief that iterated descent can produce high quality solutions to a variety of combinatorial optimisation problems. Moreover, unlike some other local search algorithms, iterated descent does not require much tuning in order to be competitive...|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} steps in {{manufacturing}} a screw: heading, thread rolling, and coating. Screws are normally made from wire, which is supplied in large coils, or round bar stock for larger screws. The wire or rod is then {{cut to the}} proper length {{for the type of}} screw being made; this workpiece is known as a blank. It is then cold headed, which is a cold working process. Heading produces the head of the screw. The shape of the die in the <b>machine</b> <b>dictates</b> what features are pressed into the screw head; for example a flat head screw uses a flat die. For more complicated shapes two heading processes are required to get all of the features into the screw head. This production method is used because heading has a very high production rate, and produces virtually no waste material. Slotted head screws require an extra step to cut the slot in the head; this is done on a slotting machine. These machines are essentially stripped down milling machines designed to process as many blanks as possible.|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to develop fundamentally new approaches for processing fibers into textile structures using MEMS technology. The specific objectives of our research are to: 1. Explore combining MEMS and small-scale robotic devices to automate the process of repairing broken warp yarns. 2.

Micro electro-mechanical systems or MEMS technology has gone from an interesting academic exercise to an integral part of many common products in several industries such as medical, automotive and ink jet industries. However, as with the most new technologies, the practical implementation of MEMS technology has taken a while to happen. We elected to demonstrate the capability of combining MEMS with small-scale robotic devices to automate one of the few tasks that still need the weaving machine operator intervention; repair of broken warp yarns.

40|$|Any {{interactive}} software program must interpret the users’ actions {{and come up}} with an appropriate response that is intelligable and meaningful to the user. In most situations, the options of the user are determined by the software and hardware and the actions that can be carried out are unambiguous. The machine knows what it should do when the user carries out an action. In most cases, the user knows {{what he has to do}} by relying on conventions which he may have learned by having had a look at the instruction manual, having them seen performed by somebody else, or which he learned by modifying a previously learned convention. Some, or most, of the times he just finds out by trial and error. In user-friendly interfaces, the user knows, without having to read extensive manuals, what is expected from him and how he can get the machine to do what he wants. An intelligent interface is so-called, because it does not assume the same kind of programming of the user by the machine, but the machine itself can figure out what the user wants and how he wants it without the user having to take all the trouble of telling it to the machine in the way the <b>machine</b> <b>dictates</b> but being able to do it in his own words.

40|$|Ideally pattern {{recognition}} machines provide constant output when the inputs are transformed under a group 6 of desired invariances. These invariances {{can be achieved}} by enhancing the training data to include examples of inputs transformed by elements of G, while leaving the corresponding targets unchanged. Alternatively the cost function for training can include a regularization term that penalizes changes in the output when the input is transformed under the group. This paper relates the two approaches, showing precisely the sense in which the regularized cost function approximates the result of adding transformed examples to the training data. We introduce the notion of a probability distribution over the group transformations, and use this to rewrite the cost function for the enhanced training data. Under certain conditions, the new cost function is equivalent to the sum of the original cost function plus a regularizer. For unbiased models, the regularizer reduces to the intuitively obvious choice-a term that penalizes changes in the output when the inputs are transformed under the group. For infinitesimal transformations, the coefficient of the regularization term reduces to the variance of the distortions introduced into the training data. This correspondence provides a simple bridge between the two approaches. 1 Approaches to Invariant Learning In machine learning one sometimes wants to incorporate invariances into the function learned. Our knowledge of the problem <b>dictates</b> that the <b>machine</b> outputs ought to remain constant when its inputs are transformed under a set of operations G. l In character recognition, for example, we want the outputs to be invariant under shifts and small rotations of the input image.

2500|$|In January 1981, MOS Technology, Inc., Commodore's {{integrated}} circuit design subsidiary, initiated {{a project to}} design the graphic and audio chips for a next generation video game console. Design work for the chips, named MOS Technology VIC-II (Video Integrated Circuit for graphics) and MOS Technology SID (Sound Interface Device for audio), was completed in November 1981. Commodore then began a game console project that would use the new chips—called the Ultimax or the Commodore MAX Machine, engineered by Yash Terakura from Commodore Japan. This project was eventually cancelled {{after just a few}} machines were manufactured for the Japanese market. At the same time, Robert [...] "Bob" [...] Russell (system programmer and architect on the VIC-20) and Robert [...] "Bob" [...] Yannes (engineer of the SID) were critical of the current product line-up at Commodore, which was a continuation of the Commodore PET line aimed at business users.

Although 64-Kbit dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) chips cost over [...] at the time, he knew that DRAM prices were falling, and would drop to an acceptable level before full production was reached. The team was able to quickly design the computer because, unlike most other home-computer companies, Commodore had its own semiconductor fab to produce test chips; because the fab was not running at full capacity, development costs were part of existing corporate overhead. The chips were complete by November, by which time Charpentier, Winterble, and Tramiel had decided to proceed with the new computer; the latter set a final deadline for the first weekend of January, to coincide with the 1982 Consumer Electronics Show (CES).|$|R
40|$|Peer-to-peer (P 2 P) {{networking}} {{is based}} on a distributed application architecture that covers a diverse set of network types. In pure P 2 P overlays, every node in the network acts as a "servent", they act as a server and a client simultaneously. Highlighting {{the fact that there is}} a lack of any centralised control, acting all nodes as equals. This networks have become very popular in the form of file-sharing networks. It {{is based on}} the idea of sharing any type of resources between all nodes. Peers are both suppliers and consumers of resources. As nodes arrive, the total capacity of the system also increases. In contrast, in a traditional client-server architecture, clients share only their demands with the system, but not their resources. In this case, as more clients join the system, fewer resources are available to serve each client. The decentralized nature of P 2 P networks also increases robustness because if a part of the system fails, it will not stop the entire system from working. As mentioned in there is a need to provide robust access control, data integrity, confidentiality and accountability services. In order to prevent other nodes from impersonating or creating an arbitrary amount of bogus nodes, all distributed systems must have a unique, undeniable and verifiable identifier for each node. The foundation of stable and verifiable identities is required to build nodes with secure parameters. The use of unsecure nodes may allow remote access to files on a victim's computer or even compromise the entire network, this is explained in. Finding suitable measures against the increasing variety of software-based attacks is a di cult task. In particular, pseudospoo ng attacks, in which malicious parties claim multiple identities and disrupt the operation of P 2 P networks. The Trusted Computing paradigm offers a very useful and powerful set of security features to improve on computer systems. The Trusted Computing Group (TCG) specifies the Trusted Platform Module (TPM), wich allows to provide cryptographically qualified and tamper-resilient statements on the software configuration of a machine. As described in, the use of protected cryptographic mechanisms alone is not suffi cient to convince remote machines or human users that a complex software service can actually be trusted. To enable a decision based on the statements made by a TPM and the associated trust levels, keys need to be vouched for. This requires a Public Key Infrastucture (PKI). Allowing a remote and indipendant party to decide on the trustworthiness of a host or a particular service. The TPM provides authenticity and allows unique identification of a platform, therefore creating a privacy problem. To circumvent this problem the TCG proposed a trusted third party, the Privacy Certification Authority (PrivacyCa). A particular incarnation of the PKI concept is the PrivacyCa, a trusted service capable of reporting its state to clients. It confirms that keys are protected by a specification-compliant TPM implementation and thus may be trusted under certain conditions, but without revealing the specific identity of the TPM and the user. In this work we provide a solution for creating unique, undeniable and verifiable identifiers for P 2 P networks by using the security features that the TPM o ers. We implement a protocol called Trusted Authentication protocol (TAP) o ering two possible solutions for authentication. One based on machines with TPM hardware enabled and a PrivacyCa that <b>dictates</b> if a <b>machine</b> can be trusted. The other solution is based on the authentication of machines using their own TPM without a PrivacyCa. The main goals of a secure P 2 P would be to identify and avoid malicious nodes, this is achieved by secure authentication of machines via TPM.

En este proyecto se demuestra como algunas propiedades de la especificación TCG (Trusted Computing Group) pueden ser utilizadas para mejorar la seguridad en redes P 2 P. Los pasos realizados para elaborar el proyecto han sido: – En primer lugar se ha llevado a cabo un estudio del estado del arte en el cual se han investigado las distintas soluciones que ofrece Trusted Computing y su aplicación en redes P 2 P. – Aprendizaje y uso de las herramientas TPM Tools, conjunto de programas y librerías. – A continuación se ha realizado el diseño del protocolo basado en una publicación del grupo IAIK SCOS el cual explica una solución de forma teórica. – También se ha llevado a cabo una familiarización inicial de los algoritmos criptográficos y mecanismos como cifrado simétrico y asimétrico, generación de número aleatorios de forma segura, funciones resumen (hash) y firmas digitales. Utilizando estos mecanismos, se ha diseñado un protocolo seguro utilizando distintos métodos del área de Trusted Computing. Un protocolo utiliza el concepto de PrivacyCA para autenticación y protección de la privacidad mientras que el otro protocolo se basa únicamente en la utilización del módulo TPM (Trusted Platform Module). Este último diseño es el que más encaja con la filosofía P 2 P dado que la ausencia de la entidad PrivacyCA deja a todos los nodos de la red como iguales. De esta forma todos los nodos trabajan de forma distribuida. Ingeniería en Informátic...|$|R
