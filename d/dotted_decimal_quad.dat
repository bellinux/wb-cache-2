50|$|Specifying an IP {{address in}} a base other than 10 may bypass some filters. The {{following}} URLs all access the same site, {{although not all}} browsers will recognize all forms: http://208.80.152.2 (<b>dotted</b> <b>decimal),</b> http://3494942722 (<b>decimal),</b> http://0320.0120.0230.02 (<b>dotted</b> octal), http://0xd0509802 (hexadecimal), and http://0xd0.0x50.0x98.0x2 (dotted hexadecimal).|$|R
25|$|Each router has an {{identifier}}, customarily {{written in}} the <b>dotted</b> <b>decimal</b> format (e.g., 1.2.3.4) of an IP address. This identifier must be established in every OSPF instance. If not explicitly configured, the highest logical IP address will be duplicated as the router identifier. However, since the router identifier is not an IP address, {{it does not have}} to be a part of any routable subnet in the network, and often isn't to avoid confusion.|$|R
50|$|No formal {{specification}} of this textual IP address representation exists. The first mention of this format in RFC documents was in RFC 780 for the Mail Transfer Protocol of May 1981, {{in which the}} IP address {{was supposed to be}} enclosed in brackets or represented as a 32bit decimal integer prefixed by a pound sign. A table in RFC 790 (Assigned Numbers) used the <b>dotted</b> <b>decimal</b> format, zero-padding each number to three digits.|$|R
5000|$|... {{accuracy}} - 8 Significand digits (7 if {{the value}} includes <b>decimal</b> <b>dot),</b> 2 exponent digits; ...|$|R
50|$|Colloquially, decimal {{numbers are}} formed by saying chut (จุด, <b>dot)</b> where the <b>decimal</b> {{separator}} is located. For example, 1.01 is nueng chut sun nueng (หนึ่งจุดศูนย์หนึ่ง).|$|R
5000|$|The {{multiplication}} sign {{is either}} a cross or a half-height dot, though the latter {{should not be used}} when the <b>dot</b> is the <b>decimal</b> separator.|$|R
50|$|CIDR is principally a bitwise, prefix-based {{standard}} for the representation of IP addresses and their routing properties. It facilitates routing by allowing blocks of addresses to be grouped into single routing table entries. These groups, commonly called CIDR blocks, share an initial sequence of bits in the binary representation of their IP addresses. IPv4 CIDR blocks are identified using a syntax {{similar to that of}} IPv4 addresses: a dotted-decimal address, followed by a slash, then a number from 0 to 32, i.e., a.b.c.d/n. The <b>dotted</b> <b>decimal</b> portion is the IPv4 address. The number following the slash is the prefix size, the number of shared initial bits, counting from the most-significant bit of the address. When emphasizing only the size of a network, the address portion of the notation is usually omitted. Thus, a /20 block is a CIDR block with an unspecified 20-bit prefix.|$|R
5000|$|I (І і), {{also known}} as the <b>dotted</b> I or <b>decimal</b> I, resembles the Latin letter I. Unlike Russian and Ukrainian, [...] "И" [...] is not used.|$|R
5000|$|In the Middle Ages, before printing, a bar ( [...] ¯ [...] ) {{over the}} units digit {{was used to}} {{separate}} the integral part of a number from its fractional part, e.g. 995 (meaning, 99.95 in decimal point format). This practice derived from the decimal system used in Indian mathematics and was popularized by the Persian mathematician Al-Khwarizmi, when Latin translation of {{his work on the}} Indian numerals introduced the decimal positional number system to the Western world. His Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing presented the first systematic solution of linear and quadratic equations in Arabic. A similar notation remains in common use as an underbar to superscript digits, especially for monetary values without a decimal mark, e.g. 9995. Later, a [...] "separatrix" [...] (a short, roughly vertical ink stroke) between the units and tenths position became the norm among Arab mathematicians, e.g. 99ˌ95. When this character was typeset, it was convenient to use the existing comma (99,95) or full stop (99.95) instead. The separatrix was also used in England as an L-shaped or vertical bar (...) before the popularization of the period and mid <b>dot</b> <b>decimal</b> points.|$|R
5000|$|Products can {{be written}} as ab, a b, a⋅b, or a×b. The sign for {{multiplying}} numbers is a cross (×) or a half-height dot (⋅). The cross should be used adjacent to numbers if a dot on the line is used as the decimal separator, to avoid confusion between a <b>decimal</b> <b>dot</b> and a multiplication dot.|$|R
50|$|If at {{any point}} the first digit is 8 or 9, these become 1 or 2, respectively. But {{if it is a}} 7 it should become 0, only if no other digits follow. Otherwise, it should simply be dropped. This is because that 7 would have become 0, and numbers with at least two digits before the <b>decimal</b> <b>dot</b> do not begin with 0, which is useless. According to this, our 7 becomes 0.|$|R
5000|$|To prove this, let [...] and [...] be {{any real}} number. Then [...] {{can have the}} tail end of its tridecimal {{representation}} modified to be either [...] or [...] depending on the sign of [...] (replacing the <b>decimal</b> <b>dot</b> with a [...] ), giving a new number [...] By introducing this modification sufficiently far along the tridecimal representation of , the new number [...] will still lie in the interval [...] and will satisfy [...]|$|R
5000|$|Where subsecond {{resolution}} is required, the seconds {{can be a}} decimal fraction; that is, the fractional part follows a <b>decimal</b> <b>dot</b> or comma, as in 01:23:45.678. The most commonly used separator symbol between hours, minutes and seconds is the colon, {{which is also the}} symbol used in ISO 8601. In the past, some European countries used the dot on the line as a separator, but most national standards on time notation have since then been changed to the international standard colon. In some contexts (including the U.S. military and some computer protocols), no separator is used and times are written as, for example, [...] "2359".|$|R
