One {{of the most commonly}} used methods of forage evaluation is to measure lignin content, with more heavily lignified materials being considered less digestible. Two measures of lignin, acid detergent lignin (ADL) and acetyl bromide lignin (ABL), were assessed with regard to their ability to predict forage digestibility. Big bluestem forage samples were collected from three ungrazed, annually burned pastures at 38, 58, and 97 days postburn. These times were selected to represent a broad range of forage quality.

30|$|Mango fruits {{are usually}} picked {{at the green}} {{maturity}} or <b>intermediate</b> <b>maturity</b> ripening stage to allow sufficient time for transport. Our results in Fig.  6 show a general trend of progressive increase in the sugar content during fruit ripening from the mature green stage to fully ripe stage. These {{results are consistent with}} reports published elsewhere (Medlicott and Thompson 1985; Vazquez-Salinas and Lakshminarayana 1985). However, high glucose content from green maturity/intermediate maturity stage to fully ripe stage is attributed to the transformation of starch into soluble sugars under the action of phosphorylase enzyme during ripening (Kansci et al. 2003). Ripening is known to induce physicochemical changes such as softening in fruits (Appiah et al. 2011). It is the sugars and organic acids which primarily contribute to the fruit taste, although in some fruits, the fruit taste can be attributed to phenolic and tanning contents (Prasanna et al. 2007). Further, low fructose concentrations at the fully ripe stage may be explained by the presence of invertase enzyme which increases in activity during ripening (Ramsey and Wang 1962). The green fruits are capable of photosynthesis, at least during the stages of ripening before the disappearance of chlorophyll (Mattoo et al. 1975). Fruits which accumulate assimilates prior to ripening can be harvested at the mature green stage and still attain acceptable flavor during ripening. This is important when considering the need for early harvest to optimize shelf life.|$|E

Since early-maturing cultivars generally show higher plant N concentration than late-maturing cultivars, it is hypothesized that [CO 2]-induced yield enhancement might be larger for early-maturing cultivars than late-maturing cultivars. To test this hypothesis, the effects of elevated [CO 2] on yield components, biomass, N uptake, and leaf photosynthesis of cultivars with different maturity groups were examined for 2 years using a free-air CO 2 enrichment (FACE). Elevated [CO 2] significantly increased grain yield and the magnitude significantly differed among the cultivars as detected by a significant [CO 2]×cultivar interaction. Two cultivars (one with early and one with late maturity) responded more strongly to elevated [CO 2] than those with <b>intermediate</b> <b>maturity,</b> resulting mainly from increases in spikelet density.

40|$|Este estudo avaliou estrutura de capital das companhias abertas brasileiras, no período de 2005 a 2012, verificando o papel das fontes de financiamento nas quais tais companhias se baseiam. Para tanto, a proporção das dívidas em três fontes distintas foram avaliadas: as instituições financeiras, o mercado de capitais e as fontes com taxas de juros subsidiadas, esta representando um fator institucional da economia brasileira. Foi utilizada uma amostra de noventa e cinco empresas dentre as cento e cinqüenta maiores empresas com ações negociadas na BM&FBOVESPA. Por meio de modelos com dados em painel, os resultados mostram que as fontes de financiamento exercem influência na formação da estrutura de capital das empresas via alavancagem e maturidade das dívidas. Em relação à alavancagem, empresas que tem maior proporção de seus recursos captados no mercado de capitais são mais alavancadas. O mesmo não acontece com as empresas que tem maior proporção de recursos subsidiados. Foram encontradas evidências de que as firmas com maior proporção de recursos no mercado de capitais são as maiores, menos rentáveis, com maior proporção de ativos tangíveis, menos arriscadas e com menores oportunidades de crescimento. Em relação à maturidade das dívidas, recursos de diferentes maturidades são captados em diferentes fontes: os recursos de menores maturidades são captados via instituições financeiras e os recursos de maiores maturidades são captados no mercado de capitais e nas fontes com taxas de juros subsidiadas (leia-se BNDES). Comparando-se os recursos do mercado de capitais com os recursos subsidiados, verificou-se que as companhias tem se utilizado do mercado de capitais para seus financiamentos de maior maturidade. Os recursos subsidiados tem sido utilizados para maturidades intermediárias. Os resultados podem ser justificados devido ao crescimento do mercado de capitais brasileiro nos últimos anos, a partir de 2009, dada a Instrução CVM Nº 476 / 09, apontando evidências de que as companhias estão alterando a forma como se utilizam das fontes de financiamento para compor sua estrutura de capital.

Therefore, the proportion of debt in three distinct sources were evaluated: financial institutions, capital markets and sources with subsidized interest rates, this representing an institutional factor of the Brazilian economy. A sample of ninety five companies, among the one hundred fifty largest companies listed on the BM&FBOVESPA, was used. Using models with panel data, {{the results show that}} the sources of financing exert influence on the capital structure of firms in two ways: via leverage and debt maturity. Regarding leverage, firms that have a higher proportion of their funds raised in the capital market are more leveraged. The same is not true for companies that have a higher proportion of subsidized resources. Were found evidence that firms with higher proportion of funds raised in the capital market are larger, less profitable, with higher proportion of tangible assets, less risky and lower growth opportunities. Regarding maturity of the debt, resources of different maturities are raised in different sources: resources of smaller maturities are raised through financial institutions and resources of larger maturities are raised in the capital markets and sources with subsidized interest rates (read BNDES). Comparing the features of the capital market with subsidized resources, {{it was found that the}} companies has used the capital market for their financing of longer maturity. Subsidized resources have been used for <b>intermediate</b> <b>maturities.</b> Results can be justified due to the growth of the Brazilian capital market in recent years, from 2009, given to Instruction CVM Nº 476 / 09, pointing out evidence that companies are changing the way they use the sources of financing to compose its capital structure...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} factor in shaping the T-cell receptor (TcR) repertoire during thymocyte development is the susceptibility of double-positive (CD 4 + CD 8 +) thymocytes to induction of apoptosis (negative selection) when the TcR is engaged by 'self'-antigens. Recent evidence has suggested that this susceptibility to apoptosis {{may be influenced by}} the expression of bcl- 2, a proto-oncogene known to increase the resistance to apoptosis in various cell systems. Using a semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique in conjunction with staged embryonic material and purified thymocyte subpopulations we have investigated patterns of bcl- 2 expression during normal T-cell development. Our results show that while bcl- 2 alpha gene expression is readily detectable in immature CD 3 -CD 4 -CD 8 - thymocytes and in mature single-positive TcRhi cells, it is drastically reduced in TcR negative double-positive (CD 3 - CD 4 + CD 8 +) cortical thymocytes of <b>intermediate</b> <b>maturity.</b> Careful mapping of bcl- 2 alpha re-expression in relation to the onset of TcR expression within the population of embryonic thymocytes indicates that bcl- 2 alpha is up-regulated as soon as TcR molecules are expressed on the surface of CD 4 + CD 8 + thymocytes. Therefore, thymocytes susceptible to apoptosis on TcR ligation express bcl- 2 alpha mRNA suggesting that changing levels of bcl- 2 expression are unlikely to be the only determinant regulating susceptibility to apoptosis in the thymus. The possible implications of these changes in bcl- 2 expression regarding other facets of thymocyte development will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|Sixty three potato clones (51 farmers’ and 12 {{varieties}}) from Eritrea, 18 and 12 varieties from Kenya and Rwanda, respectively {{were characterized}} using 12 highly polymorphic {{simple sequence repeat}} (SSR) markers. The {{study was designed to}} assess the genetic diversity and varietal distinctness among the different samples. In total, 91 alleles ranging between 2 (STM 1053) to 13 (STM 0031) alleles per marker were scored. All but 97. 8 SSR markers were highly polymorphic with an average PIC value of 0. 87 (0. 51 to 0. 98). All of the 51 farmers’ cultivars were clearly distinct from each other. Samples from Eritrea showed the highest genetic diversity as explained by the diversity index (h). The principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) revealed that the local farmers’ Eritrean samples are different from the Kenyan, Rwandese and even the imported varieties. Genetic distance analysis generated three clusters correlating with the PCoA findings. Cluster I consisted of 45 samples with 6 sub-clusters; Cluster II consisted of 29 samples with a majority (26) from Eritrea while cluster III consisted of 19 samples. Potato materials from Eritrea appeared to cluster separately from the other samples, which reflects a contribution from the Tuberosum germplasm prominent in temperate regions, unlike from the Andigenum germplasm for Kenyan and Rwandan potato materials. Most of the Eritrean samples in cluster I are farmers’ cultivars with <b>intermediate</b> <b>maturity,</b> good performance and better tuber quality characteristics. Cluster II contains mainly the imported variety from Eritrea characterized by late emergence and late maturity. The Kenyan and Rwandese were grouped mainly in Cluster III. In summary, the farmers’ cultivars are distinct from the Kenyan and Rwandese materials and represent more genetic diversity than the varieties imported into Eritrea. This finding is of interest to national breeding program to use the farmer’s materials as source of genetic variation for traits of interest. Peer Revie...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{estimate}} genetic parameters {{and evaluate the}} grain yield clones coffee Conilon three maturity groups by REML / BLUP. We studied 20 clones of coffee Conilon early ripening, maturation 20 intermediate and 20 late maturing for the characteristic grain yield. For each group, represented by different times of ripening of fruits installed an experiment was conducted in a randomized block design with four replications, plots with five plants spaced 3. 0 m X 1. 2 m with 2777 plantas/ha- 1 e evaluations {{were made in the}} years 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009, during harvest, conducted and ceded by the Institute Capixaba Research, Technical Assistance and Rural Extension (Incaper). The average heritability (0. 28, 0. 38) and the value of accuracy (0. 68, 0. 69) of clone selection were higher for the group of early and <b>intermediate</b> <b>maturity,</b> respectively. In the late group, the experimental accuracy was not satisfactory and therefore, a low accuracy in inference about the mean genotypic, reflecting the difficulty of selection. Clones 14 and 17 of the early group and 20, 14 and 17 of the intermediate group occupied the first places {{in the middle of the}} feature and productivity were also allocated in the same positions for MHVG (Genetic Stability of Values), PRVG (Adaptability of Genetic Values) and MHPRVG (Stability and Adaptability of Genetic Values), indicating a high yield, stability and adaptability to variations in four crops for these genotypes. The interaction clones x crops was significant for the three maturity groups, characterizing a complex type of interaction, which is problematic for the breeder due to inconsistency of the superiority of clones against variations of crops. The combined results showed superiority of the group over the intermediate early and late. ...|$|E
40|$|Thirty-three {{cases of}} European Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) were {{investigated}} by immunohistochemical methods using {{a panel of}} antibodies specific for the markers of the cell types proposed for its histogenesis in the literature: S- 100 protein for Schwann cells; lysozyme for histiocytes; alpha-actin, desmin and vimentin for pericytes and other mesenchyme-derived cells; factor VIIIR:Ag and Ulex europaeus agglutinin-I for endothelial cells. Antifibronectin antibodies were also used in order to investigate some functional activities of the proliferating cells. Immunohistochemical results showed that KS cells were diffusely positive for vimentin and alpha-actin and negative for all other cell markers. Furthermore, KS cells were constantly surrounded by fibronectin-positive material. Since the KS cells are diffusely positive for vimentin, they may be considered a monotypic proliferation of mesenchyme-derived cells which lack the markers of full endothelial cell differentiation; however, the occurrence of fibronectin-positive material around them suggests that these cells are actively proliferating endothelial cells and their diffuse positivity for alpha-actin suggests a possible differentiation to pericytic cells. In conclusion KS cells may be considered as mesenchymal cells which are at an <b>intermediate</b> stage of <b>maturity</b> or immaturity in vascular differentiation...|$|R
40|$|Fresh {{apricots}} (Prunus armeniaca L.) are in high demand, but {{are available}} for only a short period during the Spring {{and the beginning of}} the Summer. There is no information on the correct harvest maturity stage that should be chosen to ensure a long post-harvest life and high sensory quality. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of maturity stage at harvest on the sensory quality of ‘Palsteyn’ apricots after 14, 28, or 42 d in cold storage. Sourness, flavour, and acceptability showed major changes during cold storage. Ripe fruit (orange-yellow skin colour) showed the highest acceptability, as assessed by a “mini-consumer test” (i. e., an untrained panel; n = 36). Fruit harvested at an <b>intermediate</b> stage of <b>maturity</b> (light yellow skin colour) reached an average acceptability, while unripe fruit (greenish skin colour) were not acceptable. After 28 d of cold storage, fruits were still acceptable; but, after 42 d, fruits reached the “dislike” zone. On a principal component analysis, acceptability was shown to be positively associated with sweetness, flavour, juiciness, and aroma, and negatively associated with sourness. After 28 d and 42 d of cold storage, unripe fruit appeared to have low acceptability and quality attributes. ‘Palsteyn’ apricot harvested with an orangeyellow skin colour, as the least ripe fruits, showed that they could reach high sensory quality standards and were able to withstand long periods of cold storage...|$|R
40|$|The {{contribution}} of osmotic adjustment to grain yield in Sorghum bicolor (L.) subjected to water stress between anthesis and maturity was studied using six entries. Three of the entries (Goldrush, E 57, and DK 470) {{were selected for}} high osmotic adjustment {{and the other three}} (Texas 610 SR, Texas 671, and SC 219 - 9 - 19 - 1) for low osmotic adjustment, and divided into early, <b>intermediate</b> and late <b>maturity</b> groups. Entries were either well watered, or subjected to a 50 -day period of water shortage after anthesis following being well-watered prior to anthesis. Entries selected for high osmotic adjustment had mean values of osmotic adjustment {{at the end of the}} post-anthesis stress more than double those selected for low osmotic adjustment. The corresponding mean grain yield of entries with high osmotic adjustment were 24 % higher than that of entries with low osmotic adjustment. The higher yield was due to both more and larger grains, and it was associated with higher harvest index and distribution index. At best, the difference in dry matter at maturity could explain only a few per cent of the difference in grain yield between entries with low and high osmotic adjustment. Water stress prior to anthesis (previous paper) reduced yield more than a post-anthesis stress of the same intensity. However, osmotic adjustment was equally effective in minimizing the reduction in grain yields in both stages. The use of osmotic adjustment as a selection trait in programs to improve the yield of grain sorghum is briefly discussed...|$|R
