In November 1846, Isambard Kingdom Brunel's iron ship SS Great Britain ran aground on the sands of Dundrum Bay, Ireland. There was doubt as to whether she could be re-floated. Brunel advised that <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> rescue the ship then the man to do it was the naval engineer James Bremner. He was engaged and the Great Britain was re-floated on 27 August 1847 {{with the assistance of}} HMS Birkenhead.|$|E
25|$|Winyah {{was one of}} {{the best}} known {{landmarks}} of the vicinity of New Rochelle up until May 5, 1897, when the residence burned to the ground along with its many valuable contents. The mansion was purchased from Col. Richard Lathers by Col. C. H. Green, President of Columbia Construction and Navigation Company. He occupied it with his wife and four-year-old nephew, and three servants including a 'waitress', 'laundress' and cook. In the early morning hours the waitress awoke to the smell of smoke alerting the other occupants to flee the house. The cook ran into New Rochelle village to secure assistance. The Fire Department, with two engines, a horse cart, and a truck, responded, though the mansion was about one and a half miles from the center of town. When they arrived, however, their attempt to get water from a hydrant was unavailable due to pebbles stuck within it. Nearly 100 men came with fire apparatus, but without water they could do nothing to stop the flames. Green offered a reward <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> save two pictures from the gallery within the home however nothing could be saved and within two hours the entire structure was in ruins. The sixty-nine-foot tower in the front of the home collapsed into the center of the burning building and only two brick chimneys were left standing in the end.|$|E
500|$|More troubling was {{the lack}} of legal {{guidance}} on presidential succession: as Garfield lingered near death, no one was sure who, <b>if</b> <b>anyone,</b> <b>could</b> exercise presidential authority. Also, after Conkling's resignation, the Senate had adjourned without electing a president pro tempore, who would normally follow Arthur in the succession. [...] Arthur was reluctant to be seen acting as president while Garfield lived, and for the next two months there was a void of authority in the executive office, with Garfield too weak to carry out his duties, and Arthur reluctant to assume them. Through the summer, Arthur refused to travel to Washington and was at his Lexington Avenue home when, on the night of September19, he learned that Garfield had died. [...] Judge John R. Brady of the New York Supreme Court administered the oath of office in Arthur's home at 2:15a.m. on September20. Later that day he took a train to Long Branch to pay his respects to Garfield and to leave a card of sympathy for his wife, afterwards returning to New York City. On the 21st, he returned to Long Branch to take part in Garfield's funeral, and then joined the funeral train to Washington. [...] Before leaving New York, he ensured the presidential line of succession by preparing and mailing to the White House a proclamation calling for a Senate special session. This step ensured that the Senate had legal authority to convene immediately and choose a Senate president pro tempore, who would be able to assume the presidency if Arthur died. Once in Washington he destroyed the mailed proclamation and issued a formal call for a special session.|$|E

50|$|This was {{developed}} by Cher Ze Xiong, who died in May 2013 in Chicago. He allegedly developed the script in the 1950s while still in Laos. His script is distinct in that he uses left radicals, as in Chinese, to indicate {{the meaning of the}} words, with right radicals, or syllables, to indicate the pronunciation. In this way, it represents a fusion of Chinese and Pallava-based alphasyllabaries. It is not known <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> else <b>could</b> read the script.|$|R

2500|$|Hofmeyr's {{established}} {{reputation as}} an astute diplomat {{and the leader of}} the Cape Dutch Party made him a powerful delegate. <b>If</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> convince Kruger to change his plan, it was Hofmeyr. The moderates on all sides of the issue looked to Hofmeyr expectantly, but none as much as Schreiner. But Hofmeyr's mission, like every other such mission to induce Kruger to take a [...] "reasonable" [...] and equitable course, proved entirely fruitless. He returned to Cape Town disappointed, but not altogether surprised at the failure of his mission. Meanwhile, the Boer executive drafted a new proposal which prompted Schreiner to write a letter on 7 July to the South African News, in which while referring to his own government, he said: [...] "While anxious and continually active with good hope in the cause of securing reasonable modifications of the existing representative system of the South African Republic, this government is convinced that no ground whatever exists for active interference {{in the internal affairs of}} that republic".|$|E

But the wise secretary pursued a different course in seeking information from the American. Goodwin was a powerful friend to the new administration, and one who was not to be carelessly dealt with in respect to either his honesty or his courage. Even the private secretary of His Excellency hesitated to have this rubber prince and mahogany baron haled before him as a common citizen of Anchuria. So he sent Goodwin a flowery epistle, each word-petal dripping with honey, requesting the favour of an interview. Goodwin replied with an invitation to dinner at his own house.|$|R

2500|$|Because Fick had {{traveled}} much in his studies, {{he had the}} opportunity to meet some of 20th century's great American authors including William Faulkner whom he met in a coffee house favored by the literary set in New York City. Sometimes, to illustrate a point in the classroom, Fick would make references to one of these encounters. [...] When a student grew discouraged at the horrendous amounts of red ink expended on their term papers and essays, Fick would typically tell the student to persist in his or her efforts reminding the student that [...] "Knowledge maketh a bloody entrance," [...] or some other quip that typically went {{to the heart of the}} matter.

The assailant ordered her to get up, and, when she did, he told her to run. As she ran towards a ditch, the assailant told her not to go that way but to run up the road. She stated that while she was running, she heard Hollis groaning, and that the man {{continued}} to beat and stomp him. She was having trouble running in her high heels when the assailant ran after her. She saw an older car parked further up the street facing their vehicle. She quickly looked inside to see <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>could</b> help her, but after seeing no one, she began to run and was overtaken by the attacker. The man asked her why she was running. She told him he told her to run. Larey said, [...] "He called me a liar again and then I knew {{that he was going to}} kill me." [...] He knocked her down and assaulted her sexually. Larey stated he did not rape her but abused her terribly. Later reports indicated that the assailant sexually assaulted her with the barrel of his gun.|$|E

As a reference, Just-As-High quotes {{the second of the}} two stanzas in Grímnismál that mention the bridge (see above). Gangleri asks if fire burns over Bifröst.

You people at Bryant seem to know just what we fellows in the service need. There is nothing like a good package from friends at home to build up that morale that lowers helplessly, at times. My address, much to my sorrow, has not changed in many months, and I am eager to get on the move again. My contacts with other Bryant Alumni have slipped off, and at present writing, my only contacts are with Corporal George Tyler, someplace in southern California; Private Frank MacKendall, someplace in New Guinea; and Candidate Paul Filipowich at Barkley, Texas. I would appreciate it, <b>if</b> <b>anyone</b> at Bryant <b>could</b> furnish me with the address of Curtis Dickenman. The last time I heard from him, was in January at which time I saw him in Boston. I know that all Bryant Alumni who received such gifts as you have sent me in the past two years, appreciate them as much as I do, and I look forward with anxiety to more of the same.
