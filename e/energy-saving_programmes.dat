40|$|Nowadays, {{everyone}} {{talks about}} energy and energy use. The fact {{that almost all}} our actions require energy is becoming a threat not only to world resources but also to countries that need to assure energy for their population to use, either by producing it or buying it to other countries. Accordingly, studies that allow countries {{to know more about}} how people use energy mainly regarding how people choose appliances that consume energy, and how they use such appliances, are increasingly requested. So are the subsequent suggestions on policies, energy managing systems, and programs that shape behavior, which allow improving energy efficiency and reduce energy use. This chapter presents two studies developed {{in the last three years}} which aim to provide such knowledge and advices. Promotion 3 E regards a European project focused on increasing the knowledge about how different groups choose home appliances and how to use such knowledge to promote selling more energy efficient appliances. It was supported by the Intelligent Energy Europe â€“ IEE program. EcoIPSS refers to a project developed in Portugal aiming to know more on how people use home appliances and how to improve energy-saving behaviors, in private institutions of social solidarity (IPSS). It was supported by the Regulatory Authority of Energy Services in Portugal (ERSE) and promoted by EDP Comercial and developed by Quercus in partnership with Factor Social [...] Methodological steps and the most significant results will be provided for each study. Main conclusions will be reported including advices for policy making, research, and <b>energy-saving</b> <b>programmes...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{article is}} devoted to the problem of state {{management}} in the sphere of energy-conservation in the building sector. This problem is vital to ensure the energy and environmental security of each country. That is why the concept of the article seems to be very scientifically important. The article presents the results of scientific analysis of the creation incentives for the development of energy-efficient building. The existent management approaches and a role of program-target method of management in Russia have been analysed. Some new measures of energy-saving innovation implementation are presented. The disadvantages of current <b>energy-saving</b> <b>programme</b> have been revealed, and the concept of its improvement has been suggested...|$|R
40|$|The {{difference}} between the actual and predicted energy consumption for heating in housing {{is thought to be}} partly attributable to the use of HVAC systems. More reliable data on energy consumption could help in determining the actual energy performance of dwellings and in the search for the most adequate design for housing and home amenities. Further reductions on energy consumption might also be achieved if <b>energy-saving</b> policy <b>programmes</b> were geared to different household groups. The aim {{of this paper is to}} statistically determine Behavioural Patterns associated with the energy spent on heating and to identify household and building characteristics that could contribute to the development of energy-User Profiles. This study had two outcomes: it identified Behavioural Patterns to be used in energy calculations and it discerned User Profiles with different behaviours. Five underlying groups of behavioural variables were found, which were used to define the Behavioural Patterns and User Profiles. The groups showed statistically significant differences in the scores for most of the behavioural factors. This study established clear relationships between occupant behaviour and household characteristics. However, it seems difficult to establish relationships between energy consumption and Behavioural Patterns and household groups...|$|R
