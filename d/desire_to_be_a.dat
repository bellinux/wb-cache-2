La metamorfosis by Franz Kafka «in the false translation of Jorge Luis Borges» was a work that especially inspired him. He was excited {{with the idea of}} writing, not traditional literature, but a style similar to his grandfather's stories, in which «they inserted extraordinary events and anomalies as if they were simply an aspect of everyday life». His <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> writer grew.

It was announced in January 2011 that the actor has planned to not only star in, but direct himself in The Night Stalker, a film version of author Philip Carlo's book about the 1980s serial killer, Richard Ramirez. Co-screenwriter of the screenplay, Nicholas Constantine, was initially unconvinced that Franco would be right for the movie, until he learned of Franco's <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> director and later watched three of his short films, one of which featured a serial killer, ultimately confirming to the writer that the actor had a darker side.

5|$|While {{he had no}} <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> manager, Liddell, as a shareholder, {{had wanted}} to become a Liverpool director; however, his {{repeated}} applications to board elections were unsuccessful. He continued to play football for a magistrates' team until he decided to focus on tennis after breaking a cheek bone. In 1967, Liddell and other footballing personalities appeared in a charity match to generate funds for Bankfield House Community Centre. More than 10,000 people watched Liddell play opposite retired Hungarian international Ferenc Puskás at South Liverpool's Holly Park ground, raising £1,100 in the process.

30|$|Nevertheless, {{there are}} two {{situations}} in which the issue of separating the treatment-withdrawal decision from potential organ donation is not really relevant: (a) availability of a document (e.g., an organ donor card) in which the patient indicates his or her <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> organ donor (at present, this type of document seems applicable only {{in the event of}} brain death, but its relevance may <b>be</b> extended subsequently <b>to</b> Maastricht type III donation); (b) and spontaneous disclosure by the family, during or just after the family conference about treatment withdrawal, that the patient previously expressed <b>a</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> organ donor. However, under no circumstances does this form of consent detract from the duty to first inform patients about all organ retrieval modalities, including Maastricht type III.|$|R

25|$|Biglow and Main were {{concerned}} that the book would diminish sales of Crosby's Bells at Evening and Other Verses, which they had published in 1897 and which contained Lowry's biographical sketch of Crosby.
