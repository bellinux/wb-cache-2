During his voyage of discovery down the Mackenzie River to the Arctic Ocean in 1789, Sir Alexander Mackenzie noted in his journal {{that he had seen}} oil seeping from the river’s bank. R.G. McConnell of the Geological Survey of Canada confirmed these seepages in 1888. In 1914, British geologist Dr. T.O. Bosworth staked three claims near the spot. Imperial Oil acquired the claims and in 1918–1919 sent two geologists of its own, and they recommended drilling.|$|E

A story reel featuring a sample of Farley's recorded dialogue was leaked to the public in August 2015. DreamWorks then re-cast the voice role to Mike Myers, who insisted on a complete script rewrite, to leave no traces of Farley's version of Shrek.

[...] Jason Klein of Variety declared that DAR-Film Leaderboard was notably absent of Oscar-nominated films, but part of the gap was filled by Neerja. Sonali Kokra of The National praised the film: [...] "Neerja is a <b>great</b> <b>story</b> told well.

500|$|In July 2015, Greg Berlanti, {{creator and}} {{executive}} producer on both series, said: We've just been breaking into it {{over the last week}} or so actually ... so we're, really, excited about it. We've got a <b>great</b> <b>story</b> lined up for towards the end of the fall, early winter. This year our real hope is to make a crossover that's even bigger, and even more rewarding for the audience than the last years. The scripts for the [...] "Heroes Join Forces" [...] crossover were written in September 2015. Berlanti created the story for the event, and Kreisberg and Guggenheim helped to craft the story of The Flash and Arrow episodes, respectively. The teleplay for The Flash was written by showrunners Aaron and Todd Helbing; Arrows was written by Brian Ford Sullivan and Guggenheim.|$|E
500|$|Wyman and Pinkner saw Fringe as two shows, {{where they}} could provide a {{detailed}} mythology that was equally compelling in both universes. Eager to explore [...] "what-if" [...] moments, historical idiosyncrasies and other differences were inserted to help disambiguate the two worlds. Much of the season was designed around a doomsday device, as they believed its mysteriousness was [...] "a <b>great</b> <b>story</b> engine for us." [...] The nineteenth episode, [...] "Lysergic Acid Diethylamide", contained long sequences of animation {{in order to facilitate}} guest actor's Leonard Nimoy's retirement from acting. While the writers had attempted to continue the idea of the [...] "mythalone" [...] for both casual and devoted fans, Fringe mythology became more visible in the last episodes of the season. Equating the final three episodes to a chapter in a novel, the writers [...] "linked [...] in one continuous story arc." ...|$|E
500|$|Morris {{first came}} across {{the story of the}} Volsungs, [...] "the grandest tale that ever was told" [...] as he later called it, as a young man, when he read a summary of it in Benjamin Thorpe's Northern Mythology, which became a {{favourite}} book of his. In his The Earthly Paradise (1868–70) he included a versification of the story of Sigurd's daughter Aslaug, which he may have taken from Thorpe. In 1868 he began to learn Old Norse from the Icelandic scholar Eiríkr Magnússon, and embarked with him on a series of collaborative translations from the Icelandic classics. In 1870 they published Völsunga Saga: The Story of the Volsungs and Niblungs, with Certain Songs from the Elder Edda, claiming uncompromisingly in the preface that [...] "This is the <b>Great</b> <b>Story</b> of the North, which should be to all our race what the Tale of Troy was to the Greeks".|$|E

Before agreeing to do the Sweet Thursday project, the duo had considered other projects for their next work together, such as an adaptation of the film Saratoga Trunk. A proposal made by attorney David Merrick to adapt a series of works by Marcel Pagnol to which Merrick held the stage rights fell through when the duo were not willing to have Merrick be an associate producer; Merrick took the project elsewhere, and it was developed into the hit Fanny. Afterwards, Hammerstein stated, [...] "Why the hell did we give up Fanny? What on earth were we trying to prove?

500|$|The {{episode was}} both written and {{directed}} by Paul Lieberstein, who also plays the part of Toby Flenderson on the show. In the episode, Jim refers to a TripAdvisor page for Dwight's bed and breakfast. This can be found by searching for Schrute Farms. Jim and Pam ("JandP2") post a review, which can be seen on the actual reviews page. It reads: [...] "The architecture reminds one of a quaint Tuscan beet farm, and the natural aroma of the beets drifts into the bedrooms and makes you dream of simpler times. You will never want to leave your room. The informative lecture will satisfy all your beet curiosity, and the dawn goose walk will tug at your heart strings. Table making never seemed so possible. <b>Great</b> <b>story</b> to tell your friends. Plenty of parking! The staff’s attention to detail and devotion to cleanliness was limitless. From their enthusiastic welcome to the last wave good-bye, Schrute Farms delivers." ...|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the episodes}} {{involved}} the discovery {{and construction of}} a doomsday device, which Pinkner believed to be [...] "a good thing to design a season around" [...] because its mysteriousness was [...] "a <b>great</b> <b>story</b> engine for us." [...] While the writers tried to maintain {{the concept of the}} [...] "mythalone," [...] a storyline that was attractive to both casual and devoted Fringe fans, the series became more invested in its mythology {{towards the end of the}} third season. [...] "Lysergic Acid Diethylamide", the season's nineteenth episode, was the first of the series to contain sequences of animation. While previous guest actor Leonard Nimoy had retired, the writers still had storylines involving his character, William Bell. They were able to record his voice, and consequently worked with Zoic Studios to develop the episode. This unorthodox storytelling device was consistent with the nineteenth episodes of other seasons, including [...] "Brown Betty" [...] and [...] "Letters of Transit".|$|E

In 2008, a possible sequel was contemplated by the Wachowskis when Rain asked them why his character is so happy for Speed winning, and they replied it could be explained in the next film. Rain said he was hired for 3 years, while noting that doesn't guarantee a sequel will be released. Christina Ricci also considered it a possibility; she stated [...] "When we [...] were all leaving, we were like 'write the sequel!' 'We want to come back'. And they [...] were like, 'I know. I know.

500|$|On the PlayStation 2, Soul Reaver 2 {{respectively}} {{received an}} aggregate score of 80.71% and 80/100 from rating websites GameRankings and Metacritic. Various reviewers held its storytelling, visuals and sound in high regard, but described its gameplay as dull and unsatisfying. Doug Perry of IGN praised the game's dark atmosphere and intriguing story, {{but said that}} it can become tiresome and drag on. He thought the [...] "haughtiness" [...] and drama of the dialogue, particularly between Raziel and Kain, was often overdone, and noted that its gameplay was near identical to that of its predecessor but with less replay value. Perry enjoyed the new puzzles involving the elemental powers of the Reaver for being more complex and diverse than the block puzzles of Soul Reaver, and praised the combat system. He gave the game a score of 9.0, but in his later review for Defiance, he revised his opinion, saying this rating was [...] "way too high" [...] and [...] "that game told a <b>great</b> <b>story,</b> but just didn't deserve that score".|$|E

While he proposed no major changes to the operation of the agriculture department, Farmer emphasized teamwork as a means to improve the state's agricultural sector, cited the need to find new markets for Kentucky agricultural products, and expressed a desire to improve the public perception of the agriculture industry, saying [...] "Farmers have a <b>great</b> <b>story</b> to tell, and I will use any name recognition I have gained through my experience with UK basketball to help them tell it." [...] He also raised the possibility of engaging other former basketball players to promote the work of the agriculture department and indicated that he would lobby to have half of Kentucky's allocation of the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement directed to the state's Agriculture Development Board.|$|E
