500|$|Feynman {{nominally}} held {{an appointment}} at the University of Wisconsin–Madison {{as an assistant}} professor of physics, but was on unpaid leave during his involvement in the Manhattan project. In 1945, he received a letter from Dean Mark Ingraham of the College of Letters and Science requesting his return to the university to teach in the coming academic year. His appointment was not extended when he did not commit to returning. In a talk given there several years later, Feynman quipped, [...] "It's great to be back at the only university that ever <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> fire me." ...|$|E
500|$|Varietys Cynthia Littleton [...] "loved seeing Bernard in Grizzly Adams mode" [...] in {{the season}} five finale, while Ryan McGee from Zap2it {{compared}} Bernard's appearance to both Moses and the Gorton's Fisherman. McGee said [...] "It’s a gorgeous, gorgeous scene, even if it stands as a meta-criticism of the angst and turmoil of the show’s major characters". Alan Sepinwall from The Star-Ledger called it [...] "one of the best, most moving scenes of the finale". Noel Murray from The A.V. Club thought the scene was useful as it allowed the characters to leave the show, but also it caused him to question whether opting out was the right or wrong thing to do. The Huffington Post's Jay Glatfelter thought their decision not to participate [...] "all but solidified them as the 'Adam and Eve' [...] from the caves", although this was shown {{not to be the}} case in season six. Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune listed the pair amongst her favourite characters of the series, commenting [...] "Few things made [...] happier than seeing them comfortably ensconced in their retirement cabin with Walt's dog, Vincent. They <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> give up the whole island rat race, and their optimistic, straightforward attitudes and down-to-earth humor grounded Lost and gave us a window into normalcy, which, goodness knows, we needed sometimes".|$|E

60|$|Grace {{had great}} quickness, {{as well as}} her cousin, and though {{provoked}} at Eve's quiet hit, she <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> and <b>the</b> <b>good</b> nature to laugh.|$|R

6000|$|... "But your dog, {{who knows}} you're not well, and doesn't think me quite a fool, <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> call me. You heard him." ...|$|E
60|$|Armand was vexed that de Batz {{was sitting}} there. He {{felt he could}} have told this dainty little lady quite {{a good deal about}} England if only his pompous, fat friend would have <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> go away.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, she has <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> realise at {{last that}} I {{am the only}} person likely to keep Jimmy out of mischief. He is such a booby sometimes, and yet, somehow or other, you know, Josephine, I've never wanted to marry anybody else. I don't {{understand}} why, but there it is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, let him, if he likes," [...] said Susanna, impatiently. Marmaduke did {{not quite}} sympathize with her sudden recklessness. He hoped that Conolly would <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> to keep away.|$|R
6000|$|Toby {{could not}} give a very good account of his employer, but he <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> not to cast a damper on a party of {{pleasure}} by reciting his own troubles; so he said, evasively: ...|$|R

60|$|The carters {{were still}} English; partly because Lucie <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> see that, if she {{employed}} French labourers only, she would excite feelings of jealousy and dislike among her neighbours; {{and partly because}} she saw that, {{in the management of}} horses and cattle, the Englishmen were equal, if not superior, to her countrymen.|$|E
60|$|Dallas went to {{the junior}} study. There were Plunkett's books on the table, but of their owner no signs were to be seen. The Mutual Friend had <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> close the window after he had climbed through it, and Dallas did not suspect what had {{actually}} happened. He returned to Vaughan.|$|E
60|$|Chew it over as we might, neither Harvey nor I {{could make}} head nor {{tail of the}} matter. Both of us <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> {{realize that it was}} best to let {{sleeping}} dogs lie, and the less inquisitive we showed ourselves to be regarding Archie, the least likelihood there was we would bring suspicion upon ourselves.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Stiles {{shook his}} head. [...] "To {{tell you that}} would be to bring the French Consul into it," [...] he said, gently. [...] "I oughtn’t to <b>have</b> {{mentioned}} <b>the</b> subject at all. Burton <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> not to." ...|$|R
60|$|There is {{no reason}} why a pike should not be sick. Everything that has life is subject to illness, but it is very seldom that any fish <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> and <b>the</b> <b>good</b> fortune of <b>the</b> pike that I am going to tell you about.|$|R
50|$|In {{the five}} years since she left Winona, her hometown, Hilda Crane has been {{divorced}} twice and acquired quite a dubious reputation. She returns from New York to a scolding mother, who hopes Hilda will <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> to marry successful builder Russell Burns and finally settle down.|$|R
60|$|My mother {{saw that}} her apprehensions were laughed at, and she <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> be silent. The {{discussion}} did not the less proceed, until it was decided, after an hour more of weighing the pros and the cons, that I was {{to be sent to}} Nassau Hall, Newark, New Jersey, and was to move from that place with the college, whenever that event might happen.|$|E
6000|$|... "All {{of it and}} more. And look at the muddle {{you have}} made of things. Crystal has never got over that miserably aborted {{engagement}} of hers to de Marmont, and is no happier now with Maurice de St. Genis than {{she would have been}} with [...] . . . well! with anybody else who had <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> woo and win her in a straightforward, proper and selfish masculine way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-morning, madam," [...] said Holmes cheerily. [...] "My name is Sherlock Holmes. This is my {{intimate}} {{friend and}} associate, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I {{am glad to}} see that Mrs. Hudson has <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> light the fire. Pray draw up to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that you are shivering." ...|$|E
25|$|Louis XI <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> not {{to adopt}} René's claims in Italy. That {{was not so}} {{in the case of}} his son Charles VIII who not only {{undertook}} an expedition to Naples which gave no result but beforehand, abandoned several of his father's conquests; Artois, Franche-Comté and Roussillon, to his eventual competitors.|$|R
5000|$|From {{retrospective}} reviews, AllMovie {{stated that}} the film [...] "isn't afraid to play broad, {{and as a consequence}} it frequently feels more silly than suspenseful" [...] and that [...] "Margheriti <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> to keep <b>the</b> story moving forward at all times no matter what, and for all its faults it's an entertaining bit of European crime fare." ...|$|R
60|$|This lady {{knew all}} <b>the</b> Forsytes, and <b>having</b> been at June's 'at home,' {{was not at}} a loss to see with whom she had to deal. Her own marriage, poor thing, had not been successful, but <b>having</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> and ability to force her husband into {{pronounced}} error, she herself <b>had</b> passed through <b>the</b> necessary divorce proceedings without incurring censure.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I am {{glad you}} have <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> suggest it, Godfrey. I {{had thought of}} it myself, but I was afraid you would think it was spoiling your last {{holidays}} at home. I will see about it to-morrow. I cannot get away very well for another fortnight. If you have a dozen lessons before we go, you can practise while we are away; and mind, from to-day we will talk nothing but Russian when we are alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It may be so; but {{the wind}} has got round to nor-west, {{and has not been}} sighing these last twelve hours. Cape Bianco is not a hundred leagues from us, and, at the rate he was travelling, that gentleman with the speaking-trumpet may now be philosophizing over the {{fragments}} of his ship, unless he <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> haul off more to the westward than he was steering when last seen. His ship should have been christened the 'Scud,' instead of the 'Foam.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|It was a {{significant}} sign of his changed attitude towards his profession {{that he was not}} drawing Steve as a figure in an allegorical picture or as [...] "Apollo" [...] or [...] "The Toiler," [...] but simply as a well-developed young man who had <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> support his nether garments with Middleton's Undeniable Suspenders. The picture, when completed, would show Steve smirking down at the region of his waist-line and announcing with pride and satisfaction: [...] "They're Middleton's!" [...] Kirk was putting all he knew into the work, and his face, as he drew, was dark and gloomy.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{is of no}} use talking {{before the}} ladies,' said Mr. Underwood, getting up. 'That is, unless you <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> to join with me in telling Alda that she must give up this wild affair. <b>The</b> fellow <b>has</b> next to nothing of his own, and his uncle would see him at Jericho before he consented to a match like this!' ...|$|R
40|$|The {{workforce}} will, to some extent, {{consist of}} very able women who, <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> {{to realize that}} their working life {{is likely to be}} limited, wish to start working life after matriculation, not after spending four years in higher education. This I would argue is for <b>the</b> common <b>good.</b> Their profitable working life is extended for 4 years. (Flowers, 1963 p. 5...|$|R
60|$|And now, my friends, {{if any of}} you {{are tempted}} to follow Jacob's example, take warning betimes. You will be tempted. There are men among you--there are in every congregation--who are, like Jacob, sober, industrious, careful, prudent men, and fairly {{religious}} too; men who <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> to see that Solomon's proverbs are true, and that the way to wealth and prosperity is to fear God, and keep his commandments.|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{a couple}} of hours he was talking about poetry, and the whole harangue was one eloquent {{proclamation}} of the defects in his own mind. Tennyson wrote in verse because the schoolmasters had taught him that it was great to do so, and had thus, unfortunately, been turned from the true path for a man. Burns had, in like manner, been turned from his vocation. Shakespeare had not <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> see {{that it would have been}} better to write straight on in prose;--and such nonsense, which, though amusing enough at first, he ran to death after a while.|$|E
60|$|I dwell {{upon the}} good qualities and high {{character}} of the Lenape, because it was from their main body that numerous tribes came across the Delaware River, {{and became the first}} Jerseymen, or, if any one likes it better, Scheyichbians. They settled in many pleasant places, building wigwam villages, many of which have since grown into modern towns, and still bear their old Indian names. In fact, the modern Jerseyman has <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> preserve a great many of the names given to rivers, mountains, and villages by the first owners of the soil.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. White, reigning {{there in}} the summer, in her fine house and gardens, though {{handsome}} as ever, <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> <b>to</b> resign the palm of beauty, and be gratified with the admiration for one whom she accepted as a protegee and appendage, whose praise reflected upon herself. And Cliff House under the new regime was a power in Rockstone, with its garden-parties, drawing-room meetings on behalf of everything good and desirable, its general superintendence and promotion of all that could aid in {{the welfare of the}} place. There was general rejoicing when it was occupied.|$|E
60|$|The Secretary, {{working in}} the Dismal Swamp betimes next morning, was {{informed}} that a youth waited in the hall who gave the name of Sloppy. The footman who communicated this intelligence made a decent pause before uttering the name, to express that it was forced on his reluctance by the youth in question, and that if <b>the</b> youth <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> and <b>good</b> taste to inherit some other name it would <b>have</b> spared <b>the</b> feelings of him the bearer.|$|R
5000|$|An AfterEllen review {{discussed}} Jess {{and said}} [...] "I think it’s partly because she’s such an effective wolf in sheep’s clothing, whereas every other villain proudly owns their evil. But mostly it’s Georgia Chara’s performance, which combines tenderness and ruthlessness {{in a way}} I’ve never seen before. WAIT. Yes I have. Jess is like that bunny rabbit in Monty Python and the Holy Grail, that no one <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> {{to be afraid of}} because it looks so cute and sweet and innocent." ...|$|R
5000|$|Olin Downes praised a Salzburg {{performance}} of his Five Pieces for String Quartet in 1924: [...] These pieces attempted only to charm or entertain. They had spontaneous humor, sentiment, a fluent and admirable technic.sic <b>The</b> idiom <b>has</b> enough modern pepper in it to constantly stimulate the ear; but the music is not forced, {{any more than it}} is portentous. A young composer of talent disported himself in these pieces, and his audience was duly grateful. Not all composers, old or young, <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>sense</b> not to take themselves, now and again, too seriously.|$|R
