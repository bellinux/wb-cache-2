40|$|The main aim of {{this paper}} is to {{identify}} the consequences magnitude of providing <b>electronic</b> <b>starters,</b> also called Soft Starters, in AC electrical motors with largest powers and the economical appreciation of this measure. Through this, it aims not only to identify the technical and economic arguments for applying more decided the provision of <b>electronic</b> <b>starters,</b> but also the limits of its application, given the great diversity of receivers rated power. Thus, it is appreciated that there is no question of applying Soft Starters for the whole power range of asynchronous motors. In context of the proposed analysis, a summary of <b>electronic</b> <b>starters</b> issues is made which may be a guide of their choice and application, facilitating the specialists access in the technical manuals of the companies producing Soft Starters...|$|R

2500|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>starters</b> only {{attempt to}} start a lamp {{for a short time}} when power is {{initially}} applied, and do not repeatedly attempt to restrike a lamp that is dead and unable to sustain an arc; some automatically shut down a failed lamp. This eliminates the re-striking of a lamp and the continuous flickering of a failing lamp with a glow <b>starter.</b> <b>Electronic</b> <b>starters</b> are not subject to wear and do not need replacing periodically, although they may fail like any other electronic circuit. Manufacturers typically quote lives of 20 years, or as long as the light fitting. Starters are inexpensive, typically less than 50¢ for the short-lived glow type (depending upon lamp power), and perhaps ten times more for the electronic type [...]|$|R
50|$|The E.28/39 lacked {{features}} {{that would be}} considered key to an active combat fighter, such as the lack of radio sets. The original engine was started by an Austin Seven car engine, which was connected by a flexible drive; later on, this arrangement was replaced by an <b>electronic</b> <b>starter</b> system that used a ground booster battery instead. The cockpit, which was accessed by a sliding canopy lacked pressurisation or any form of climate control, such as heating systems. While pilots were intended to wear electrically-heated flight suits, {{the lack of an}} onboard generator and limited battery capacity, the latter being prioritised towards the automated sensors and recording devices that captured the results of each flight, this was not possible and pilots {{had to put up with}} the cold conditions throughout a given flight.|$|E
40|$|Being the workhorse, {{induction}} motors {{are serving}} the industry. Mostly {{we can see}} squirrel cage motors, but when it's come to the large industries, wound rotor induction motors are also there. Applications like Mills, Large Fans, Pumps, Blowers, Crushers and Overhead Cranes which require higher starting torques use wound rotor induction motors {{to have a higher}} starting torque at a lower starting current at the stator. Generally wound rotor induction motors require more maintenance than squirrel cage motors because of its rotor construction, slip ring assembly and the starting method used. Conventionally, wound rotor motors use an external resistor bank, which is connected to the rotor winding via slip rings, and external rotor resistance varies from a maximum value to zero as the rotor speed develops. Varying the external resistance can be achieved by several electromechanical methods. This is done in a stepwise manner with a motorized camshaft with electromechanical contact points or with a set of electrical power contactors and timers having a suitable time delay between adjacent steps. The traditional starter is highly mechanical and can cause lot of startup delays and is bulkier and requires frequent maintenance. To ensure right operation of rotor resistance control, the motor control circuit incorporates several additional measures and these are too prone to failures due to their own nature. Due to high heat dissipation in the resistors the number of consecutive startups during a short time period is also limited. The proposed power <b>electronic</b> <b>starter</b> is entirely a power electronic device, which is having a three-phase rectifier bridge and a programmable transistor chopper. Programmable transistor chopper ensures a gradual speed development at rotor and control the acceleration with the duty factor of the transistor. This could eliminate the major disadvantage of traditional starter, which is the dependability of rotor speed with the load torque by extending it to have a closed loop speed control. Thereby we can ensure the programmable torque-speed characteristics with this power <b>electronic</b> <b>starter.</b> This power electronic development will minimize the overall maintenance, and avoid current fluctuations completely during speed changes while demanding speed up or down at the rotor. This report discusses the proposal, simulations in prone to the construction, hardware design and practical implementation and testing of starter with a no load wound rotor motor. Latter part of the report shows the performances of new starter over the conventional starter and future developments possible...|$|E
40|$|Recently {{the world}} {{governing}} body of aquatic sport has approved {{the use of}} a new starting platform (Omega OSB 11), and it is currently being used at all international events. Due to the recent approval, swimmers are modifying their start techniques to be able to maximize performance from the new platform. This study investigated the effectiveness of the grab and track competitive swimming start techniques off of the Omega OSB 11 start block using a single-subject experimental design. A replica start block was constructed with an embedded force plate. Four subjects participated in this study; two males and two females. The protocol consisted of six starts; three of the track start technique, and three of the grab start technique. Using kinetic data collected from the force plate and signal from an <b>electronic</b> <b>starter,</b> the time to two-meters was predicted. A two-tailed paired t-test was used to determine if the track starts were significantly faster than the grab starts for each subject. Results show that all four subjects were faster to the two-meter mark using the track start technique than the grab start method. Our findings suggest that swimmers should consider using the track start over the grab start on the Omega OSB 11 platform...|$|E
2500|$|More {{recently}} introduced <b>electronic</b> <b>starters</b> {{use a different}} method to preheat the cathodes. They may be designed to be plug-in interchangeable with glow starters for use in standard fittings. They commonly use a purpose-designed semiconductor switch and [...] "soft start" [...] the lamp by preheating the cathodes before applying a controlled starting pulse which strikes the lamp first time without flickering; this dislodges a minimal amount of material from the cathodes during starting, giving longer lamp life than possible with the uncontrolled impulses to which the lamp is subjected in a switchstart. This is claimed to prolong lamp life {{by a factor of}} typically 3 to 4 times for a lamp frequently switched on as in domestic use, and to reduce the blackening of the ends of the lamp typical of fluorescent tubes. The circuit is typically complex, but the complexity is built into the IC. <b>Electronic</b> <b>starters</b> may be optimized for fast starting (typical start time of 0.3 seconds), or for most reliable starting even at low temperatures and with low supply voltages, with a startup time of 2–4 seconds. The faster-start units may produce audible noise during start-up.|$|R

40|$|Variable speed drives {{are growing}} and varying. Drives expanse depend on {{progress}} in {{different part of}} science like power system, microelectronic, control methods, and so on. Artificial intelligent contains hard computation and soft computation. Artificial intelligent has found high application in most nonlinear systems same as motors drive. Because artificial intelligent techniques can use as controller for any system without requirement to system mathematical model, {{it has been used}} in electrical drive control. With this manner, efficiency and reliability of drives increase and volume, weight and cost of them decrease. Due to the improved operating characteristics they give to the equipment control, <b>electronic</b> motor soft <b>starters</b> are increasingly widely applied. Escalators, pumps, elevators and conveyor belts all operate more effectively if they are soft started. However, it is not simply the ergonomics of an airport, process plant or shopping mall that are improved by soft starters. A major factor in the growth in popularity of soft starters is the reduced wear and tear that they place on motors and their associated drive systems. In turn, this reduces maintenance, conserves energy and plays a significant part in improving plant performance and operating costs...|$|R
5000|$|The {{process of}} {{recycling}} a vehicle is extremely complicated {{as there are}} many parts to be recycled and many hazardous materials to remove. Briefly, the process begins with incoming vehicles being inventoried for parts. The wheels and tires, battery and catalytic converter are removed. Fluids, such as engine coolant, oil, transmission fluid, air conditioning refrigerant, and gasoline, are drained and removed. Certain high value parts such as <b>electronic</b> modules, alternators, <b>starter</b> motors, infotainment systems - even complete engines or transmissions - may be removed if they are still serviceable and can be profitably sold on; either in [...] "as-is" [...] used condition or to a remanufacturer for restoration. Other hazardous materials such as mercury, and sodium azide (the propellant used in air bags) may also be removed. After all of the parts and products inside are removed, the remaining shell of the vehicle is sometimes subject to further processing, which includes removal of the air conditioner evaporator and heater core, and wiring harnesses. The remaining shell is then crushed flat, or cubed, to facilitate economical transportation in bulk to an industrial shredder or hammer mill, where the vehicles are further reduced to fist-sized chunks of metal. Glass, plastic and rubber are removed from the mix, and the metal is sold by multiple tons to steel mills for recycling.|$|R
