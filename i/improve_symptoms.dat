5|$|In adults {{short term}} use of nasal decongestants {{may have a}} small benefit. Antihistamines may <b>improve</b> <b>symptoms</b> in the first day or two; however, there is no longer-term benefit and they have adverse effects such as drowsiness. Other decongestants such as {{pseudoephedrine}} appear effective in adults. Ipratropium nasal spray may reduce the symptoms of a runny nose but has little effect on stuffiness. The safety and effectiveness of nasal decongestant use in children is unclear.|$|E
5|$|No {{treatments}} stop {{or reverse}} its progression, though some may temporarily <b>improve</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Affected people increasingly rely on others for assistance, often placing {{a burden on}} the caregiver; the pressures can include social, psychological, physical, and economic elements. Exercise programmes may be beneficial with respect to {{activities of daily living}} and can potentially improve outcomes. Treatment of behavioural problems or psychosis due to dementia with antipsychotics is common, but not usually recommended, as there is little benefit with an increased risk of early death.|$|E
5|$|Repetitive {{transcranial}} magnetic stimulation temporarily improves levodopa-induced dyskinesias. Its {{usefulness in}} PD is an open research topic, Several nutrients have been proposed as possible treatments; however {{there is no evidence}} that vitamins or food additives <b>improve</b> <b>symptoms.</b> There is no evidence to substantiate that acupuncture and practice of Qigong, or T'ai chi, have any effect on the course of the disease or symptoms. Fava beans and velvet beans are natural sources of levodopa and are eaten by many people with PD; their intake is not free of risks as life-threatening adverse reactions have been described, such as the neuroleptic malignant syndrome.|$|E
40|$|Topical {{intranasal}} steroid (INS) <b>improves</b> <b>symptom</b> {{scores in}} adults with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Nasal saline irrigation <b>improves</b> <b>symptoms</b> {{better than no}} treatment, but is not as effective as INS.

5|$|Both {{environmental}} factors and genetics {{are associated with}} alcoholism with about half the risk attributed to each. A person with a parent or sibling with alcoholism is {{three to four times}} more likely to be alcoholic themselves. Environmental factors include social, cultural, and behavioral influences. High stress levels, anxiety, as well as inexpensive easily accessible alcohol increases risk. People may continue to drink partly to prevent or <b>improve</b> <b>symptoms</b> of withdrawal. A low level of withdrawal may last for months following stopping. Medically, alcoholism is considered both a physical and mental illness. Both questionnaires and certain blood tests may detect people with possible alcoholism. Further information is then collected to confirm the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Topical {{and oral}} {{preparations}} of nicotinamide (the amide form of vitamin B3) {{have been suggested}} as alternative medical treatments. It is thought to improve acne due to its anti-inflammatory properties, {{and its ability to}} suppress sebum production, and promote wound healing. Topical and oral preparations of zinc have similarly been proposed as effective treatments for acne; evidence to support their use for this purpose is limited. The purported efficacy of zinc is attributed to its capacity to reduce inflammation and sebum production, and inhibit P. acnes. Antihistamines may <b>improve</b> <b>symptoms</b> among those already taking isotretinoin due to their anti-inflammatory properties and their ability to suppress sebum production.|$|E
25|$|Patients are {{followed}} closely after a treatment regimen has been completed. Frequently, other treatments {{are used to}} <b>improve</b> <b>symptoms</b> and maximize nutrition.|$|E

25|$|There is no {{cure for}} RA, but {{treatments}} can <b>improve</b> <b>symptoms</b> and slow {{the progress of the}} disease. Disease-modifying treatment has the best results when it is started early and aggressively.|$|E
25|$|Without treatment, anxiety {{disorders}} tend to remain. Treatment may include lifestyle changes, counselling, and medications. Counselling is typically with {{a type of}} cognitive behavioural therapy. Medications, such as antidepressants or beta blockers, may <b>improve</b> <b>symptoms.</b>|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{stress can}} {{aggravate}} allergic conditions. This has {{been attributed to}} a T helper 2 (TH2)-predominant response driven by suppression of interleukin 12 by both the autonomic nervous system and the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis.

In addition, no differences between different birth control pill preparations were found.|$|E
25|$|The {{evidence}} for antacids is weaker with a benefit of about 10% (NNT=13) while {{a combination of}} an antacid and alginic acid (such as Gaviscon) may <b>improve</b> <b>symptoms</b> 60% (NNT=4). Metoclopramide (a prokinetic) is not recommended either alone or {{in combination with other}} treatments due to concerns around adverse effects. The benefit of the prokinetic mosapride is modest.|$|E
25|$|In August 2011, Publix began {{offering}} Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor {{that is used}} to prevent, treat, or <b>improve</b> <b>symptoms</b> of high blood pressure, certain heart conditions, diabetes, and certain chronic kidney conditions, as another free prescription. Customers can get a 90-day supply of this prescription for free at any Publix Pharmacy, up to a maximum of 180 tablets. Lisinopril-HCTZ combination products are excluded.|$|E
50|$|Treatment {{depends on}} the type and {{severity}} of the condition. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and immunosuppressants are often used. Intravenous Immunoglobulin may also occasionally be used. While treatment usually <b>improves</b> <b>symptoms</b> they do not typically cure the disease.|$|R
30|$|Studies {{involving}} lipids {{reveal the}} potential use of NSAIDs [119] for <b>improving</b> <b>symptoms</b> associated with FECD.

50|$|MS {{patients}} treated with 4-AP exhibited {{a response rate}} of 29.5% to 80%. A long-term study (32 months) indicated that 80-90% of patients who initially responded to 4-AP exhibited long-term benefits. Although <b>improving</b> <b>symptoms,</b> 4-AP does not inhibit progression of MS.|$|R
25|$|Myasthenia gravis is {{generally}} treated with medications known as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as neostigmine and pyridostigmine. Immunosuppressants, such as prednisone or azathioprine, {{may also be}} used. The surgical removal of the thymus gland may <b>improve</b> <b>symptoms</b> in certain cases. Plasmapheresis and high dose intravenous immunoglobulin may be used during sudden flares of the condition. If the breathing muscles become significantly weak, mechanical ventilation may be required.|$|E
25|$|Endoscopic {{therapy with}} botulinum toxin, known also as Botox, {{can also be}} used to improve {{dysphagia}} which stabilizes unintentional weight loss, but the effect has limited effect on other symptoms, including pain, while also being a temporary treatment lasting a few weeks. Finally, pneumatic dilatation of the esophagus, which is an endoscopic technique where a high-pressure balloon is used to stretch the muscles of the LES, can be performed to <b>improve</b> <b>symptoms,</b> but again no clinical improvement is seen in regards to motility.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{cure for}} IBS. Treatment is carried out to <b>improve</b> <b>symptoms.</b> This may include dietary changes, medication, probiotics, and counseling. Dietary {{measures}} include increasing soluble fiber intake, a gluten free diet, or a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP). The medication loperamide {{may be used to}} help with diarrhea while laxatives may be used to help with constipation. Antidepressants may improve overall symptoms and pain. Patient education and a good doctor–patient relationship {{are an important part of}} care.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{cure for}} Parkinson's disease, with {{treatment}} directed at <b>improving</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Initial treatment is typically with the antiparkinson medication levodopa (L-DOPA), with dopamine agonists being used once levodopa becomes less effective. As the disease progresses and neurons continue to be lost, these medications become less effective {{while at the same}} time they produce a complication marked by involuntary writhing movements. Diet and some forms of rehabilitation have shown some effectiveness at <b>improving</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Surgery to place microelectrodes for deep brain stimulation has been used to reduce motor symptoms in severe cases where drugs are ineffective. Evidence for treatments for the non-movement-related symptoms of PD, such as sleep disturbances and emotional problems, is less strong.|$|R

25|$|Unless {{contraindicated}} or not tolerated, ACE inhibitor (ACE) {{therapy is}} recommended for all patients with systolic heart failure, irrespective of symptomatic severity or blood pressure. ACE inhibitors <b>improve</b> <b>symptoms,</b> decrease mortality and reduce ventricular hypertrophy. Angiotensin II receptor antagonist therapy (also referred to as AT1-antagonists or angiotensin receptor blockers), particularly using candesartan, is an acceptable alternative if the patient is unable to tolerate ACEI therapy. ACEIs and ARBs decrease afterload by antagonizing the vasopressor effect of angiotensin, thereby decreasing {{the amount of work}} the heart must perform. It is also believed that angiotensin directly affects cardiac remodeling, and blocking its activity can thereby slow the deterioration of cardiac function.|$|E
25|$|The United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) {{guide for}} the {{management}} of CFS states that while there is no cure, a number of methods might <b>improve</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Treatment strategies for sleep problems, pain, (depression, stress, and anxiety) dizziness and lightheadedness (Orthostatic Intolerance), and memory and concentration problems are enumerated. Other useful topics mentioned that patients and doctors might discuss include; carefully monitoring and managing activity to avoid worsening of symptoms, counseling to cope with the impact the illness may have on quality of life, proper nutrition and nutritional supplements that may support better health, complementary therapies that might help increase energy or decrease pain.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{foods and}} {{lifestyle}} {{are considered to}} promote gastroesophageal reflux, but most dietary interventions have little supporting evidence. Avoidance of specific foods and of eating before lying down should be recommended only to those {{in which they are}} associated with the symptoms. Foods that have been implicated include coffee, alcohol, chocolate, fatty foods, acidic foods, and spicy foods. Weight loss and elevating the head of the bed are generally useful. A wedge pillow that elevates the head may inhibit gastroesophageal reflux during sleep. Stopping smoking and not drinking alcohol do not appear to result in significant improvement in symptoms. Although moderate exercise may <b>improve</b> <b>symptoms</b> in people with GERD, vigorous exercise may worsen them.|$|E
