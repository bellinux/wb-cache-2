While <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> much {{to speak}} of a renaissance in traditional Norwegian architecture, more and more urban planning is affected by the need to preserve or restore these traditions. Examples include plans to renew the center of Oppdal and recent work at the Oslo neighborhood of Grünerløkka.|$|E

In this case, one can {{subdivide}} the complex shape into simpler, more elementary shapes, whose centers of mass are easy to find. If the total mass and center of mass can be determined for each area, then the center of mass of the whole is the weighted average of the centers. This method can even work for objects with holes, which can be accounted for as negative masses.|$|E
25|$|Violet is revived in the {{facility}} run by Garth, and {{she realizes that}} Six might not actually be dead. She storms the Archministry and reaches a laboratory just as Daxus {{is about to begin}} the dissection. In the ensuing fight, Daxus reveals that he uses enhancements he gained from an accidental exposure to the hemophage virus to aid in his rise to power. Violet kills Daxus and leaves with Six's body. Six later wakes up, having been immunized by the hemophage virus in Violet's tears. It is theorized that Six might, after all, be instrumental in formulating a cure for the hemophages, although <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> late for Violet (who is nearing the end of her 12 years).|$|E

25|$|Card users {{sometimes}} {{forget to}} touch in or touch out, {{are unable to}} find the yellow readers or <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> crowded to touch out. Such card users have either received penalty fares by revenue inspectors, been charged a maximum cash fare, or been prosecuted in courts which can issue high penalties. Card users are also penalised for touching {{in and out of}} the same station within a two-minute period. The system applies two penalty fares (one for touching in, and one for touching out) to passengers who touch in, wait more than twenty minutes for a train, but are unable to travel because there are no trains, baulk at the waiting, and touch out. This is because the system assumes that, after such a long delay, the passenger has traveled to another station where they have failed to touch out and failed to touch in, thus resulting in two penalty fares.|$|E
25|$|The sixth {{season begins}} {{a year after}} the {{conclusion}} of the fifth season, with Dean living a somewhat happy life with Lisa and Ben. When an emotionless Sam returns to Dean, he is forced to leave his new life behind and work with his resurrected grandfather Samuel to capture Alpha monsters for Crowley. The brothers are unable to get much help from Castiel since his time is occupied by a civil war raging in heaven against the archangel Raphael. Dean does not trust Samuel and his suspicions are confirmed when he finds Samuel working with demons to discover the location of Purgatory. Dean discovers that Sam's soul is still in the Cage, so he implores the Horseman Death to retrieve it. To ensure Sam does not remember his time in the Cage, as <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> much for him to handle, Death blocks that part of Sam's memory using a mental wall. The season's second half revolves around the so-called Mother of All, which ultimately leads to events which prove that Castiel is behind the circumstances of Sam's return, the hunt for the Alpha monsters, and the search for Purgatory and was working with Crowley the entire time. When the brothers try to stop Castiel, he brings Sam's memory of the Cage back and proceeds with his plan, absorbing all the souls from Purgatory and pronouncing himself God, having ascended beyond a mere angel.|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from critics, who praised the acting, particularly {{the performances of}} Bell and Wahlberg, while criticizing the gruesome nature of the story. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 36% of 117 critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 4.6 out of 10. The site's consensus was, [...] "Saw II is likely to please the gore-happy fans of the original, though <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> gruesome for those not familiar with first film's premise". Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, gives the film a score of 40 based on 28 reviews.|$|E

It stars Jennifer Lawrence, Javier Bardem, Michelle Pfeiffer, Domhnall Gleeson, Ed Harris and Kristen Wiig. The film sparked controversy upon release for its depiction of violence, and, though it received generally positive reviews, it polarized audiences, becoming one of few films to receive a [...] "F" [...] CinemaScore grade. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 69% based on 278 reviews, and an average rating of 6.8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, [...] "There's no denying that Mother! is the thought-provoking product of a singularly ambitious artistic vision, though <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> unwieldy for mainstream tastes." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Treehouse of Horror" [...] is {{the third}} episode of The Simpsons second season. It {{originally}} aired on the Fox network in the United States on October 25, 1990. The episode was inspired by 1950s horror comics, and begins with a disclaimer that <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> scary for children. It is the first Treehouse of Horror episode. These episodes do not obey the show's rule of realism and are not treated as canon. The opening disclaimer and a panning shot through a cemetery with humorous tombstones were features that were used sporadically in the Treehouse of Horror series and eventually dropped. This is also the first episode to have the music composed by Alf Clausen, taking over for Danny Elfman who also wrote the show's theme.|$|E
500|$|Several critics {{suggested}} that the piece {{may have been too}} sophisticated for its audience—or at least, the audience that greeted its first performance on Boxing Night. The Times wrote: [...] "The dialogue throughout is superior in ability and point to that with which ordinary burlesque and extravaganza have familiarized us; so much so, in fact, that it was a daring experiment to produce such a piece on such a night. It met, however, with an excellent reception, and on any other occasion than Boxing Night the numerous merits of the piece cannot fail to secure for it in the public estimation a high place among the novelties of the season." [...] Other reviews of the first night took up a similar theme: Sporting Life {{suggested that}} [...] "It may be that they looked for something less polished than Mr. Gilbert's verse, and went for something broader and coarser than that delightful author's humour. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>be,</b> <b>too,</b> that Thespis was a little—I only say, just a little—'over their heads'." [...] The Orchestra carried a similar sentiment: [...] "In fact, both music and idea were somewhat {{over the heads of the}} audience." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{retreat of}} Army Group North from the {{surroundings}} of Leningrad made the commanders of Finland realise that soon <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> late to start {{negotiations with the}} Soviet Union. On 31 January 1944, General Field Marshal Keitel {{sent a letter to}} the Finnish Commander-in-Chief Mannerheim, claiming that the retreat of Army Group North to the Panther Line constituted no danger whatsoever to Finland. Marshal Mannerheim did not share the optimism, expressing his concern that the road in Narva would be open not only to Estonia, but also to Finland. As the German condition worsened in the Narva front, President of Finland Juho Kusti Paasikivi was presented with Stalin's peace terms on 8 February. However, Finland resumed in the war. To separate Finland from Germany and make her defence hopeless, Stalin needed to conquer Estonia. Stalin hoped that a breakthrough at Narva would make Finland sign a peace treaty quickly. The perspective of an invasion to East Prussia through Estonia appealed even more to the Soviet Main Command, as it appeared bringing German resistance to a collapse. Stalin gave a short and clear order to the Leningrad Front on 14 February: ...|$|E
2500|$|The Washington Post {{journalist}} Carlos Lozada {{wrote in}} a review that on reading the book, it was [...] "striking to see the full argument unfold and realize that you don't {{have to be a}} zealot to imagine some version of it happening". He concluded: [...] "Lichtman's case for impeachment is plausible, certainly, but it is far stronger as an argument for why Americans never should have elected Trump in the first place. Yet we did. So it may not be too soon for this book, after all. <b>It</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> late." [...] Joy Lo Dico reviewed the book for the London Evening Standard writing: [...] "His argument races through 200 pages, with steam for more." [...] New York Journal of Books contributor Basil Smilke Jr. reviewed the book favorably, writing: [...] "The Case for Impeachment is a good backdrop for conversations that will likely remain a part of our national dialogue for some time – or if you are a member of Congress trying to grapple with all that this administration has wrought." [...] AM Joy host Joy-Ann Reid said it was a [...] "fascinating book," [...] particularly because Lichtman {{had been one of the}} only prognosticators to correctly predict Trump would win the 2016 election. Joe Scarborough on Morning Joe called the book [...] "liberal catnip".|$|E
2500|$|Mate is {{traditionally}} drunk {{in a particular}} social setting, such as family gatherings or with friends. The same gourd (cuia) and straw (bomba/bombilla) are used by everyone drinking. One person (known in Portuguese as the preparador, cevador, or patrão, and in Spanish as the cebador) assumes the task of server. Typically, the cebador fills the gourd and drinks the mate completely {{to ensure that it}} is free of particulate matter and of good quality. In some places, passing the first brew of mate to another drinker is considered bad manners, as <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>too</b> cold or too strong; for this reason, the first brew is often called mate del zonzo (mate of the fool). The cebador possibly drinks the second filling, as well, if he or she deems it too cold or bitter. The cebador subsequently refills the gourd and passes it to the drinker to his or her right, who likewise drinks it all (there is not much; the mate is full of yerba, with room for little water), and returns it without thanking the server; a final gracias (thank you) implies that the drinker has had enough. The only exception to this order is if a new guest joins the group; in this case the new arrival receives the next mate, and then the cebador resumes the order of serving, and the new arrival will receive his or hers depending on his placement in the group. When no more tea remains, the straw makes a loud sucking noise, which is not considered rude. The ritual proceeds around the circle in this mode until the mate becomes lavado (washed out), typically after the gourd has been filled about 10 times or more depending on the yerba used (well-aged yerba mate is typically more potent, so provides a greater number of refills) and the ability of the cebador. When one has had one's fill of mate, he or she politely thanks the cebador, passing the mate back at the same time. It is impolite for anyone but the cebador to move the bombilla or otherwise mess with the mate; the cebador may take exception to this and not offer it to the offender again. When someone takes too long, others in the roda (Spanish: ronda; English: [...] "round") will likely politely warn him or her by saying [...] "bring the talking gourd" [...] (cuia de conversar); an Argentine equivalent, especially among young people, being no es un micrófono ("it's not a microphone"), an allusion to the drinkers holding the mate for too long, as if they were using it as a microphone to deliver a lecture.|$|E
