5|$|The {{most common}} predators of greater noctule bat are barn owl (Tyto alba) and Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo). The greater noctule bat {{generally}} leaves its roost to forage after <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> completely dark outside, this {{coincides with the}} general time that the two mentioned owl species hunt. There is also some risk to the greater noctule from parasitism between bats.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most {{electrical}} insulators, diamond {{is a good}} {{conductor of}} heat because of the strong covalent bonding and low phonon scattering. Thermal conductivity of natural diamond {{was measured to be}} about 2200W/(m·K), which is five times more than copper. Monocrystalline synthetic diamond enriched to 99.9% the isotope 12C has the highest thermal conductivity of any known solid at room temperature: 3320W/(m·K). Because diamond has such high thermal conductance <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> used in semiconductor manufacture to prevent silicon and other semiconducting materials from overheating. At lower temperatures conductivity becomes even better, and reaches 41000W/(m·K) at 104K (12C-enriched diamond).|$|E

5|$|Doctor Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley) is {{concerned}} that the increasing numbers of tribbles threaten to consume all the food aboard the Enterprise. It is discovered that they are entering ship systems, interfering with their functions, and consuming any edible contents present. Kirk realizes that if the tribbles are getting into the ship's stores, they are {{a threat to the}} grain aboard the station. He examines the holds but learns that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> too late: The tribbles have indeed eaten the quadrotriticale, and Kirk is literally buried in grain-gorged tribbles when he opens a grain hold with an overhead hatch. Spock (Leonard Nimoy) and McCoy discover that about half the tribbles in the hold are dead and many of the rest are dying, alerting them that the grain has been poisoned.|$|E

25|$|In September 2015, Jersey City {{launched}} Citi Bike, a bike-sharing {{program that}} has seen 7,500 total rides {{in just the last}} six months.

25|$|A second ring line, {{further from}} the centre than the {{existing}} one, has also been discussed. However, light rail will probably be constructed instead.

25|$|How do we {{make sure}} {{augmented}} paths are vertex disjoint? <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> guaranteed: After doing the symmetric difference for a path, none of its vertices could be considered again just because the Dist will not be equal to Dist + 1 (It would be exactly Dist).|$|E

25|$|Another {{decision}} {{added two}} more guidelines regarding {{the design of}} the coins. The state issuing a coin should in some way clearly be identified on the obverse side, either by stating the full name or a clearly identifiable abbreviation of it; and neither name nor the denomination of the coin should be repeated on the obverse, as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> featured on the common reverse side.|$|E

25|$|There are two {{different}} mechanisms involved in production of a tan by UV exposure: Firstly, UVA radiation creates oxidative stress, which in turn oxidises existing melanin and leads to rapid darkening of the melanin. UVA may also cause melanin to be redistributed (released from melanocytes where <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> stored), but its total quantity is unchanged. Skin darkening from UVA exposure {{does not lead to}} significantly increased production of melanin or protection against sunburn.|$|E
25|$|Discussion {{regarding}} destiny {{does not}} necessitate {{the existence of}} supernatural powers. Logical determinism or determinateness {{is the notion that}} all propositions, whether about the past, present, or future, are either true or false. This creates a unique problem for free will given that propositions about the future already have a truth value in the present (that is <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> determined as either true or false), and {{is referred to as the}} problem of future contingents.|$|E
25|$|The park {{board has}} banned the {{erection}} of any further memorials {{to ensure that}} Stanley Park is kept in a more natural state (and based on the view that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> saturated).

The federal government spent approximately $800,000 to build the memorial and playground.|$|E
