These services include protection to people environment and properties and they address {{a large number of}} threats both natural and man-made, acts of terrorism, technological, radiological or environmental accidents. Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have always played an important role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> safety <b>domain.</b> <b>The</b> capability of exchanging information (e. g., voice or data) is essential to improve <b>the</b> coordination of <b>public</b> safety officers during an emergency crisis. Wireless communications are particularly important in field operations to support the mobility of first responders. Operational and business requirements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> safety <b>domain</b> are significantly different from the commercial domain.

30|$|As common {{infrastructure}} for government users, the SBDS focuses on constructing and providing {{new types of}} big spatial data through location-based integration of business data (e.g., real estate transaction registers) and spatial data (e.g., land parcels) from national information systems, {{as well as through}} mashups of big data <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> and private <b>domains</b> (e.g., time series data of the geographic distributions of cell phone users). At present, the SBDS makes online or offline connections to other national information systems for regular collections and updates of raw data. It then applies various geocoding mechanisms to the collected data so as to enable on-demand, location-based mashups of different raw datasets. As of December 27, 2015, the SBDS provides 15 types of new pre-built databases in support of policy analyses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>domains</b> of real estate, transportation, and regional development [21]. These pre-built databases include statistics for administrative or statistical units, road networks in a node-link structure, and original attributes of point-referenced parcels and buildings.|$|R
