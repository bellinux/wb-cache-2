40|$|This report {{presents}} an update of the ICT <b>Innovation</b> <b>Output</b> <b>Indicator</b> {{based on the}} latest available data, and provides {{a measure of the}} performance of the European Union (EU) and its Member States in ICT innovation. The ICT <b>Innovation</b> <b>Output</b> <b>Indicator</b> is the contribution of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) to the <b>Innovation</b> <b>Output</b> <b>Indicator</b> elaborated by the European Commission in 2013. The contribution of ICT has been computed for each underlying component of the <b>Innovation</b> <b>Output</b> <b>Indicator</b> for all EU Member States. Depending on the indicator component analysed and data availability, the ICT contribution to innovation can refer either to innovation in the ICT sector as defined by the classification of economic activities, or to ICT use as a general purpose technology {{in the rest of the}} economy. The up-to-date ICT contributions for the EU aggregate are: 1. 	 28 % in technological innovation as measured by patents; 2. 	 19 % in absorption of skills as measured by employment in knowledge intensive activities; 3. 	 27 % in competitiveness of knowledge goods as measured by exports of medium-high tech goods; 4. 	 20 % in competitiveness of knowledge services as measured by exports of knowledge intensive services; 5. 	 23 % in innovative firms’ dynamics as measured by employment of innovative fast-growing firms. All data refer to 2013 with the exception of data on patents which refer to 2011. The methodology to compute the ICT <b>Innovation</b> <b>Output</b> <b>Indicator</b> follows the one presented in "How much does ICT contribute to innovation output? An analysis of the ICT component in the innovation output indicator" (Pesole, 2015). The reader is referred to this report for more detail on the methodology. The 2013 EU aggregate ICT contributions are very similar to those in 2012 reported by Pesole (2015). The technological innovation component (i. e. ICT PCT patent) increased by two percentage points in 2011 (from 26 % to 28 %). Similarly, competitiveness of knowledge goods increased from 25 % to 27 % in 2013. The other contributions remain unchanged. The ICT <b>Innovation</b> <b>Output</b> <b>Indicator</b> delivers a measure of output-oriented ICT innovation that captures both the technological and non-technological aspects of innovation in ICT and ranks Member States' performance. The three top performing countries remain the same as in Pesole 2015 : Finland, Ireland and Sweden. JRC. J. 3 -Information Societ...|$|E

40|$|During {{the past}} years, {{the role of}} ICT as key driver and enabler of {{innovation}} has been widely recognized. The advent and development of ICT transformed {{the economy and the}} society in an evident way. However, what and how ICT contributes to this value creation process and its full potential remains hard to detect. There is a need for continuous monitoring of ICT impacts in order to provide policy makers with appropriate tools to define the right policies to seize ICT benefits. In light of this, a final aim for policy makers is to develop methodologies and tools to measure the performance of ICT innovation in Europe.

40|$|Successful {{innovation}} {{depends on}} knowledge – technological, strategic and market related. In this {{paper we explore}} the role and interaction of firms’ existing knowledge stocks and current knowledge flows in shaping innovation success. The paper contributes {{to our understanding of}} the determinants of firms’ <b>innovation</b> <b>outputs</b> and provides new information on the relationship between knowledge stocks, as measured by patents, and <b>innovation</b> <b>output</b> <b>indicators.</b> Our analysis uses innovation panel data relating to plants’ internal knowledge creation, external knowledge search and <b>innovation</b> <b>outputs.</b> Firm-level patent data is matched with this plant-level innovation panel data to provide a measure of firms’ knowledge stock. Two substantive conclusions follow. First, existing knowledge stocks have weak negative rather than positive impacts on firms’ <b>innovation</b> <b>outputs,</b> reflecting potential core-rigidities or negative path dependencies rather than the accumulation of competitive advantages. Second, knowledge flows derived from internal investment and external search dominate the effect of existing knowledge stocks on innovation performance. Both results emphasize the importance of firms’ knowledge search strategies. Our results also re-emphasize the potential issues which arise when using patents as a measure of innovation...|$|R

40|$|In both {{academic}} literature and political discussions {{the concept of}} innovation is recognized as an essential ingredient in economic development and competitiveness for firms, regions, and nations. Innovation also ranks {{at the top of}} policy agendas in the field of regional policy. Therefore, the attractiveness of an appropriate innovation index for ranking regions and further developing them along a more or less objective measurement scale is evident. However, whether such rankings help convey a better understanding of innovation and its drivers, or whether they are merely a special type of 'beauty contest' with little substance is the focus of our analyses. To deny the latter, the <b>innovation</b> <b>output</b> <b>indicators</b> used for the composite index have to be appropriate representatives of the underlying innovation concept and each indicator has to be driven by the same impact factors. If this is not the case, interpretation of the index inevitably gives rise to partly inappropriate policy recommendations. In order to demonstrate this claim we elaborate a set of innovation indicators at the regional level based on the theoretical concept of the OECD document 'The Measurement of Scientific and Technological Activities, Proposed Guidelines for Collecting and Interpreting Technological Innovation Data' known as the 'Oslo Manual' (OECD, 2005) and their empirical implementation in the Community Innovation Survey. Additionally, innovation drivers well established in the literature are collected to estimate their impact on each innovation indicator {{as well as on the}} composite index derived from the innovation indicators. The question whether 2 innovation should be measured as a multidimensional concept and investigated using various indicators or whether simplifying innovation to a one-dimensional concept is appropriate is clearly answered in favour of the multidimensional approach. Surprisingly, this is not due to the multidimensionality of the indicators themselves (all statistical measures indicate that the considered variables are sufficiently represented by one component), but to our first evidence that the <b>innovation</b> <b>output</b> <b>indicators</b> are driven by various impact factors and can therefore be influenced by various political strategies. According to these findings any type of innovation ranking is of very limited use...|$|R
40|$|In {{contrast}} to findings in other countries, and surprisingly {{in view of}} the literature, innovation in the Netherlands is not spread geographically according either to relevant labour market characteristics or to localized agglomeration economies. Instead, statistical analysis shows that the Netherlands is an urban field, and that the regional knowledge infrastructure - universities of technology in particular - is the only variable that can offer an explanation of innovative activity throughout the country. By analysing similar relationships for younger firms, we are able to make a quite strong case about causation. We estimate these regional spillovers using the Literature Based <b>Innovation</b> <b>Output</b> <b>indicator</b> by screening two successive volumes of 43 specialist trade journals for product announcements. Output indicators for innovativeness - except for patents, which have well-known disadvantages as an indicator - are not often used in the relevant literature, partly because they are not readily available. Our analysis offers the possibility to assess how consistent the use of input versus output indicators of innovativeness is in the analysis of the geographical spread of innovative activity...|$|E

40|$|Measuring {{innovation}} activities involves critical decisions in selecting appropriate indicators {{and levels of}} observation. The present article {{contributes to the literature}} on this subject by addressing innovation measurement on the regional level. The dimensionality of regional innovation is examined by applying a principal component analysis on seven <b>innovation</b> <b>output</b> <b>indicators</b> in European regions from the Community Innovation Survey and two traditional indicators, i. e. patent applications and R&D expenses. The analysis reveals that regional innovation indeed needs to be regarded as a multidimensional concept involving technological, commercial and service innovation. These distinct {{innovation activities}} exhibit clear regional patterns with both technological and service innovation concentrated in highly developed territories and urban areas displaying particularly strong innovation performance in services. In addition, commercially successful innovation appears clustered in backward regions and may thus be seen as imitation efforts and technology transfers from areas at the innovation frontier. Overall, the elaborated findings suggest that the selection of innovation indicators in empirical analyses demands appropriate motivation and theoretical guidance...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} innovation {{paths and}} the innovation performance of low-technology firms {{in comparison to}} medium- and high-technology firms. Firstly, it shows that low-, medium- and high-technology sectors consist of a considerable mix of low-, medium- and high-technology firms. Thus, {{it is necessary to}} look at the firm level when analysing how innovation patterns differ depending on the level of R&D intensity. Secondly, the product and process innovation performance of low-technology firms in German industry is analysed based on data from 1663 firms in the German Manufacturing Survey 2006, applying a set of both product and process related <b>innovation</b> <b>output</b> <b>indicators.</b> The empirical results show that low-technology manufacturing firms lag behind their medium- and high-tech counterparts regarding their product and service innovation performance, to a large degree on purely definitional grounds, but that they seem to perform equally well and in some respects even better at process innovation.

It is also important as basis for the design and implementation of innovation policies. Different methodologies dealing with innovation performance are found {{not only in the}} literature but also in more official organizations such as the European Commission, articulated by the Community Innovation Surveys and the European Innovation Scoreboard. One of the main concerns in these methodologies is {{how to deal with the}} <b>outputs</b> of an <b>innovation</b> system. Many difficulties arise in the use of science and technology statistics, as there are several phenomena that are hard to measure. In addition, it may be important to distinguish between: (i) innovations in a proper sense (product and process innovations), (ii) determinants of innovations (learning, interactions), and (iii) consequences of innovations (growth, employment).

40|$|Starting from today’s {{definition}} of innovation indicators, this paper analyses the dynamic relationships between innovation activities (approximated by two innovation input indicators and one <b>innovation</b> <b>output</b> <b>indicator)</b> and {{per capita income}} in Germany for the two periods from 1850 until 1913 and 1951 until 1999. Already {{the first step of}} the analysis which is based on unit root tests allowing for structural breaks shows that the German innovation system was rather stable in both periods: In the first period the unit root hypothesis has to be rejected for all four variables, in the second period at least for the two innovation input indicators. Thus, only a few major historical events responsible for the structural breaks have persistent effects while most shocks are transitory. The further analysis of unrestricted as well as restricted VAR models gives evidence that the innovation activities in both periods are strongly demand driven, but that there seem to be two different logics in the innovation process. In the first period, the overall empirical results indicates a linear innovation relation between students numbers as well as public science expenditures, the number of patents granted, and economic demand. In the second period, demand drives total R&D expenditures while patent output does not follow demand. The real domestic product seems not to depend strongly on innovation activities.

40|$|This {{technical}} report presents the 2016 update of the <b>Innovation</b> <b>Output</b> <b>Indicator</b> (IOI), the latest {{scores for the}} composite index and for the underlying indicators. It also discusses in details how changes in the statistical definition {{of some of the}} underlying indicators affect the methodology and results. We recall that the IOI was developed by the European Commission {{at the request of the}} European Council in order to benchmark national innovation policies and to monitor the EU’s performance against its main trading partners. The IOI is a composite of four indicators and measures the extent to which ideas stemming from innovative sectors are capable of reaching the market, providing better jobs and making Europe more competitive. It covers technological innovation, skills in knowledge-intensive activities, the competitiveness of knowledge-intensive goods and services, and the innovativeness of fast-growing enterprises. It complements the R&D intensity indicator by focusing on innovation output. It aims to support policy-makers in establishing new or reinforced actions to remove bottlenecks preventing innovators from translating ideas into successful goods and services. This 2016 edition of the IOI offers a number of novelties. It expands international coverage to Israel, New Zealand and Brazil (altogether 38 countries are now compared over a 4 -year time frame). It implements changes in statistical definitions in national accounts (ESA 2010) and international service trade statistics (BPM 6), affecting PCT and SERV components, and uses updated innovation coefficients (CIS 2010 as opposed to CIS 2008) for the DYN scores, and updates scaling coefficients fitting the larger, updated dataset. The report addresses the issue of improving timeliness by using most recent data available for KIABI, GOOD and SERV. Sensitivity analysis highlights that the revision of SERV has the largest impact on outcomes. JRC. DDG 1. 01 -Econometrics and applied statistic...|$|E

40|$|Transition economies that {{formerly}} {{were within}} the Soviet Union 2 ̆ 019 s {{political and economic}} sphere had {{on the eve of}} the crisis much lower GDPs per capita than the EU 15 or the United States, despite exhibiting higher growth.

40|$|The article’s aim is {{to conduct}} a {{comparative}} cross-section analysis of the innovative behaviour of the German manufacturing industry. The peculiarities of the food industry are tested in a combined analysis based on both input and <b>output</b> <b>indicators.</b> Linear and logistic regressions are used to investigate {{the differences between the}} food industry and other branches of the manufacturing industry. In comparison to other branches, the food industry has lower research & development (R&D) expenditures whereas the import of research from more technology intensive sectors is high. Most of the released new products are improvements and imitations. Market novelties are rare. The development time for new products is relatively short compared to other industries, on average 8. 5 months. A major part of innovations are imitated rapidly by competing firms, therefore the first mover advantages are low. Due to the low newness of innovations, marketing activities (e. g. advertising, labelling) are more important for new product introductions than in other industries. The regression analysis for the input indicators measured by the innovation intensity shows that the innovative behaviour of food companies significantly deviates from other manufacturing sectors. However, the logistic regression analysis of the <b>output</b> <b>indicators</b> doesn’t confirm these results. The dummy variable of the food companies has no significant impact on the <b>output</b> <b>indicators.</b> Firms in the food industry might embark on imitation and product modification strategies. Therefore, they realize an average <b>innovation</b> <b>output</b> without spending {{the same amount of money}} as the other industries. In addition, it can be confirmed that small enterprises of the German manufacturing industry have a higher innovation activity in terms of both <b>innovation</b> input and <b>output.</b> The impact of business expectations on input and <b>output</b> <b>indicators</b> is significantly positive.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{contribute}} to the understanding of Norwegian Professional Service Firms (PSFs) by exploring the effect of internal factors’ impact on <b>innovation</b> <b>output.</b> The four internal factors selected for this study are (1) organizational inertia, (2) training, (3) human capital and (4) innovation culture. The economy is becoming increasingly knowledge based, and at the same time, the importance of innovation is becoming more prevalent in the business world. Even among PSFs, that are perceived as conservative, innovation is now becoming critical for survival. However, it is challenge to become a successful innovator, as there are many factors that may influence the innovation process. Overall, the research associated with the internal factors’ impact on <b>innovation</b> <b>output</b> in PSFs is limited, and this will be the first study on the topic in Norway. The study has a quantitative approach and investigates innovation behavior by analyzing primary data obtained from 142 classic and neo-classic Norwegian PSFs. Through this study, we have defined a measure on the extent to which the different internal factors exist among Norwegian PSFs and a measure on the level of <b>innovation</b> <b>output</b> among them. We have established that there is a statistical significant relationship between organizational inertia and <b>innovation</b> <b>output,</b> and <b>innovation</b> culture and <b>innovation</b> <b>output.</b> Alongside, we have found that human capital and training is high among all respondents. Further, our study show that size does not have a significant controlling effect on any of the relationships, while age have a significant impact the relationship between innovation culture and <b>innovation</b> <b>output.</b> The last control variable, sub-sector, was only analyzed at the descriptive level, and it is found that there are clear differences between neo-classic and classic PSFs.

40|$|According to the Innovation Union Scoreboard, {{published}} by the European Commission every year, Sweden has been, and still is, an innovation leader within the EU {{and one of the}} most innovative countries in Europe. In the Innovation Union Scoreboard 2014 (European Union, 2014 : 5), Sweden has the top position (ranked number 1) of all EU 28 Member States in what is called “EU Member States’ Innovation Performance”. In the ranking there are 10 countries between Sweden and the EU average. This analysis is based on the rankingprovided by one single composite indicator (SII or Summary Innovation Index), based on 25 separate indicators. In this paper we argue that the SII provided by the Innovation Union Scoreboard is highly misleading. The data (the 25 separate indicators) that constitute this composite innovation indicator need to be analyzed much more in depth in order to reach a correct measure of the performance of an innovation system. We argue that input and <b>output</b> <b>indicators</b> need to be considered separately and measured individually and as two groups of indicators. Thereafter we compare the input and <b>output</b> <b>indicators</b> with one another (as is normally done in productivity and efficiency measurements). The outcome of this is a relevant and better measure of innovation performance. In this paper, the performance of the Swedish national innovation system is analyzed by using exactly the same data as is used by the Innovation Union Scoreboard 2014. We analyze the relative position of Sweden regarding both input and <b>output</b> <b>indicators,</b> concluding that Sweden’s position as an innovation leader within the EU must be reconsidered. A theoretical background and reasons for selecting the indicators used is given and a new position regarding Sweden’s innovation performance compared to the other countries is calculated. Our findings show, that Sweden remains in a high position for the innovation input indicators, ranked number 1. However, with regard to <b>innovation</b> <b>output,</b> Sweden is ranked number 10. In other words, about a third of all European Union 28 Member States have a higher <b>innovation</b> <b>output</b> than Sweden. To estimate the efficiency or productivity of the Swedish innovation system, inputs and outputs must be related to each other. When doing so, we reach the conclusion that Sweden is ranked number 24 of EU 28 Member States. This finding is then discussed and we also discuss which countries would be relevant for Sweden to compare (benchmark) its innovation system with. The conclusion is that Sweden, based on our calculations, can certainly not be seen as an innovation leader in Europe. This means that the Innovation Union Scoreboard is flawed and may therefore mislead researchers, policy-makers, politicians as well as the general public – since it is widely reported in the media...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} investigates {{deals with}} the impact of various innovation activities on <b>innovation</b> <b>output</b> by using Spanish CIS 3 data on 3, 247 innovative firms and applying several Knowledge Production Functions. It is confirmed that different innovation activities lead to differences in both the propensity to innovate and <b>innovation</b> <b>output,</b> depending on the technological characteristics a firm has. In general, internal R&D leads to product innovation, while machinery acquisition leads to process innovation. Size, group belonging and protection of innovations are important determinants for <b>innovation</b> <b>output,</b> but show either a positive or negative relation, depending again on the firm's innovation strategy. R&D, innovation, Knowledge Production Function, double sample selection...|$|R

Effects on productivity growth and capital and labor inputs are distinguished. Furthermore, different time lags are examined for the various analyzed effects and two time periods as well as less and more developed countries are studied separately. The results confirm the effect of <b>innovation</b> <b>output</b> on productivity for more developed countries. Simultaneously, <b>innovation</b> <b>output</b> is found to have negative impacts on capital and labor inputs, while public research is found to have positive impacts on labor inputs...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} an empirical link between bureaucratic structures and country-level <b>innovation</b> <b>outputs.</b> Although {{there has been}} growing scholarly attention to public sector innovation, {{we still have a}} limited understanding {{of the relationship between the}} structures of public bureaucracies and country-level innovation. This paper emphasizes the importance of bureaucratic structure in ex-plaining cross-national variations in country-level <b>innovation</b> <b>outputs.</b> It hypothesizes that countries where bureaucrats’ careers are determined by merit-based recruitment rather than political appoin-tees tend to record higher <b>innovation</b> <b>outputs,</b> controlling for other confounding factors. Countries with higher levels of impartiality of bureaucracies in decision-making also tend to have higher inno-vation outputs. Utilizing cross-national data from the Quality of Government Institute Expert Sur-vey and Global Innovation Index, findings show that levels of <b>innovation</b> <b>outputs</b> are significantly higher in countries that have higher levels of professional and impartial bureaucracies. The results suggest the importance of administrative designs to promote innovative activities.

40|$|One {{important}} element of a firm’s organizational environment that may influence innovation is whether the CEO of the firm is its founder. Popular perception is that the inherent venturous spirit of the founders creates an environment that fosters innovation. This study investigates whether founder-CEOs are more innovative than nonfounder CEOs. Using a sample of S&P 500 firms from 1995 - 2005 and the NBER patent database for measuring <b>innovation</b> <b>output,</b> the study’s baseline results suggest that founder-CEOs are actually associated with fewer patents (quantity of innovation) and fewer citations (quality of innovations), a finding that is contrary to popular perception. However, to reveal the true picture of the innovativeness of founders, evaluating the effect of <b>innovation</b> <b>output</b> on overall firm valuation is necessary. Thus, the study considers the effect of <b>innovation</b> <b>output</b> on firm valuation and suggests that founder-CEOs add more value by innovation. The market greets the <b>innovation</b> <b>output</b> of founder-run firms more favorably than the <b>innovation</b> <b>output</b> of non-founder-run firms. This value addition holds even after controlling for strategic investments such as R&D. This finding helps to identify a probable channel -innovation that bridges, at least partially, {{the gap in the}} literature that shows that there is a ‘founder-premium’...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} influences of technological opportunity {{on the relationship}} between market structure and the <b>innovation</b> <b>output</b> of different-size firms. A simultaneous-equations model is specified and estimated separately for technologically progressive and technologically unprogressive industries. The study finds that innovation activities of small firms and large firms bear different relationships to market structure, in part resulting from interindustry differences in technological opportunity. In technologically progressive industries, <b>innovation</b> <b>output</b> (especially of small firms) is lower in the presence of high concentration and is increased substantially by high R&D intensity. Large-firm <b>innovation</b> <b>output</b> has a positive effect on industry concentration, but only in technologically unprogressive industries. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R

This paper aims to endogenize the productivity heterogeneity of exporting firms by incorporating innovation in a structural model framework. In doing so, we close the gap between the innovation-productivity and productivity-export literature. Two waves of Swedish Community Innovation Survey (CIS) are merged. This allows for a dynamic setup that takes into account the proper lags from innovation input to <b>innovation</b> <b>output</b> and also from <b>innovation</b> <b>output</b> to productivity and export. The applied framework corrects for selectivity, simultaneity, and potential endogeneity biases. The main findings highlight that exporters are productive firms with <b>innovation</b> <b>output</b> in the past, which in turn was driven by prior R&D and other innovation activity investments...|$|R
