500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Noi doi", when {{translated}} to English, feature {{an invitation to}} a love interest: [...] "Baby/ Would you <b>do</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> favor/ If you come to the sea/ We would be both under the sun/ Under the sun, both of us". Regarding this, Stan said in a press release: [...] "I am the child of the sea, I feed myself with the sun, I love the energy of the water and I think that's what sea means: happiness, fun, where the stress disappears and also the ideal place to start relationships".|$|E
500|$|Despite time {{constraints}} imposed on {{him by the}} expansion of his business, Boulton continued his [...] "philosophical" [...] work (as scientific experimentation was then called). [...] He wrote in his notebooks observations on the freezing and boiling point of mercury, on people's pulse rates at different ages, on {{the movements of the}} planets, and on how to make sealing wax and disappearing ink. [...] However, Erasmus Darwin, another fellow enthusiast who {{became a member of the}} Lunar Society, wrote to him in 1763, [...] "As you are now become a sober plodding Man of Business, I scarcely dare trouble you to <b>do</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> favour in the... philosophical way." ...|$|E
500|$|Como's {{comments}} {{during a}} 1949 interview were prophetic, {{as far as}} his success was concerned. At the time he was doing the Chesterfield Supper Club on both radio and television, [...] "Television is going to <b>do</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> lot more personal good than the movies ever have... The reason should be obvious. On television, I'm allowed to be myself; in pictures, I was always some other guy. I come over like just another bum in a tuxedo." [...] Como was offered some movie roles [...] that interested him after he began appearing on the weekly TV shows, but there was just never enough time to pursue any film work.|$|E
5000|$|... "I don't {{know who}} you are sir, or where you come from, but you've <b>done</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> power of good." [...] - often {{shortened}} to [...] "you've (or [...] "that's") <b>done</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> power of good". In [...] "The Gold Plate Robbery" [...] the catchphrase was set to music.|$|R
60|$|Then I {{remembered and}} laughed and that laugh <b>did</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> world of good.|$|R

2500|$|Evel Knievel {{took great}} pride in his core values. Throughout his career and later life he would {{repeatedly}} talk {{about the importance of}} [...] "keeping his word". He stated that although he knew he may not successfully make a jump or even survive the canyon jump, he followed through with each stunt because he gave his word that he would. Prior to the canyon jump, Knievel stated, [...] "If someone says to you, 'that guy should have never jumped the canyon. You knew if he did, that he'd lose his life and that he was crazy.' <b>Do</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> favor. Tell him that you saw me here and regardless of what I was, that you knew me, and that I kept my word." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1950, Harry Truman called Smathers into {{a meeting}} at the White House and {{reportedly}} said, [...] "I want you to <b>do</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> favor. I want you to beat that son-of-a-bitch Claude Pepper." [...] Pepper had been part of an unsuccessful 1948 campaign to [...] "dump Truman" [...] as the Democratic presidential nominee, and Smathers had been his manager and pupil. Smathers challenged the incumbent senator in the Democratic primary and won by a margin of over 60,000 votes. The race was marked by echoes of the Red Scare. Smathers repeatedly attacked Pepper for having Communist sympathies, pointing out his pro-civil rights platform and campaign for universal health care as well as his travels to the Soviet Union in 1945.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the 1950 Florida Senate election, President Harry Truman called George Smathers into {{a meeting}} at the White House and {{reportedly}} said, [...] "I want you to <b>do</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> favor. I want you to beat that son-of-a-bitch Claude Pepper." [...] Pepper had been part of an unsuccessful 1948 campaign to [...] "dump Truman" [...] as the Democratic presidential nominee. Smathers ran against him in the Democratic primary (which at the time in Florida was tantamount to election, the Republican Party still being in infancy there). The contest was extremely heated, and revolved around policy issues, especially charges that Pepper represented the far left and was too supportive of Stalin. Pepper's opponents circulated widely a 49-page booklet titled The Red Record of Senator Claude Pepper. Pepper was defeated in the primary by Smathers.|$|E
6000|$|... "You have <b>done</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> great wrong--you have <b>done</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> cruel wrong! I {{have been}} telling it to Miss Vivian; I came on purpose to tell her. I can't really tell her; I can't tell her the details; it 's too painful! But you know what I mean! I {{could n't stand it}} any longer. I thought of going away--but I could n't do that. I must come and say what I feel. I can't bear it now." ...|$|R

2500|$|Having {{decided to}} marry, Darwin visited his cousin Emma on 29 July 1838 {{and told her}} of his ideas on transmutation. On 11 November he {{returned}} and proposed to Emma. Again he discussed his ideas, and about ten days later she wrote, [...] "When I am with you I think all melancholy thoughts keep {{out of my head}} but since you are gone some sad ones have forced themselves in, of fear that our opinions on the most important subject should differ widely. My reason tells me that honest & conscientious doubts cannot be a sin, but I feel it would be a painful void between us. I thank you from my heart for your openness with me & I should dread the feeling that you were concealing your opinions from the fear of giving me pain. It is perhaps foolish of me to say this much but my own dear Charley we now do belong to each other & I cannot help being open with you. Will you <b>do</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> favour? yes I am sure you will, it is to read our Saviours farewell discourse to his disciples which begins {{at the end of the}} 13th Chap of John. It is so full of love to them & devotion & every beautiful feeling. It is the part of the New Testament I love best. This is a whim of mine it would give me great pleasure, though I can hardly tell why I don't wish you to give me your opinion about it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Again he {{discussed}} his ideas, and she subsequently wrote telling him of her [...] "fear that our {{opinions on the}} most important subject should differ widely. My reason tells me that honest & conscientious doubts cannot be a sin, but I feel it would be a painful void between us. I thank you from my heart for your openness with me & I should dread the feeling that you were concealing your opinions from the fear of giving me pain."

It is so full of love to them & devotion & every beautiful feeling." [...] In the Farewell Discourse from the Gospel of St. John, Jesus instructs his disciples to [...] "love one another", a central part of Christian doctrine which emphasises the need for belief. For Emma the importance of faith had been reinforced by the death of her sister Fanny in 1832, and her need to meet Fanny again in the afterlife. She clearly felt that Darwin would be able to overcome doubt and believe. John 15 also says [...] "If a man abide not in me...they are burned". Darwin's warm reply reassured her, and she replied that [...] "To see you in earnest on the subject will be my greatest comfort & that I am sure you are. I believe I agree with every word you say, & it pleased me that you shd have felt inclined to enter a little more on the subject." [...] However, this tension would remain.|$|E

60|$|DAISY. [Coolly.] As {{it turns}} out you only <b>did</b> <b>me</b> <b>a</b> service. But still you haven't told me to what I owe the honour of your visit.|$|R
