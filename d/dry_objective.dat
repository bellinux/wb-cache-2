Exposed areas with diameters of 5 - 20 µm, 1 - 5 µm, and sub-micron widths are readily achieved by focussing through a 20 x <b>dry</b> <b>objective,</b> a 40 x <b>dry</b> <b>objective,</b> or a 100 x oil immersion lens, respectively. When combined with a sub-micron resolution, high-speed, computer-controlled X-Y-Z stage, well-defined channels or arrays can be patterned in the AAPO, revealing either the underlying hydrophobic primed-glass surface, or pendant amino groups suitable for the covalent binding of biomolecules, depending on the amount of energy delivered to the surface. The subsequent removal of the attached BSA creates well-defined regions with high contrast.

40|$|The use of Raman {{microspectroscopy}} to {{depth profile}} multi-layered polymer laminates {{is becoming increasingly}} popular. However, the results are generally degraded by aberrations introduced by the change in refractive index at the air/sample interface.

This study evaluates this proposal by comparing depth profiling results on a multi-layer poly(styrene) /poly(methylmethacrylate) (PS/PMMA) laminate polymer from both <b>dry</b> metallurgical <b>objectives</b> and immersion objectives (used in combination with an oil of suitable refractive index). The immersion technique enabled successful depth profiling to the full working distance of the objective (100 µm), showing clear and distinct variations in 11 different layers within the laminate; a <b>dry</b> metallurgical <b>objective</b> used for comparison achieved poor resolution of only two layers.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel technique for the fabrication of a multianalyte protein microassay {{on the basis}} of the creation of microwells that locally enhance the adsorption of proteins. The microwells are fabricated via a localized laser ablation of a protein-blocked thin gold layer (~ 50 nm) deposited on a poly(methyl methacrylate) film. The microablation of gold induces local chemical and physical changes in the top surface of the polymer as well as a higher specific surface, which cooperate to achieve a higher and more reproducible surface concentration of proteins in microwells. The fabrication platform consists of a computer-controlled laser ablation system, comprising a research-grade inverted optical microscope, a pulsed nitrogen laser emitting at 337 nm, a programmable XYZ stage, and a picoliter pipet mounted on the XYZ stage. The microwells with diameters of 5 - 20 m, 1 - 5 m, and submicron widths are readily achieved by focusing through a 20 × <b>dry</b> <b>objective,</b> a 40 × <b>dry</b> <b>objective,</b> or a 100 × oil immersion lens, respectively. One variant of the method uses a sequence of local ablation and "flood" coverage with protein solution. The second variant uses the microablation of the whole microassay followed by the "spatially addressable" deposition of different protein solution with a picoliter pipet mounted on the same fabrication platform. The analytical performance of the device required only a 2 - 7 L volume of sample and a single dilution step. The results indicate that antibody arrays can be used to identify different proteins, yielding results within a few minutes of sample addition with acceptable assay repeatability. It was observed that the microassays comprising line-shaped microstructures offer a higher reproducibility as well as offering the opportunity to encode the information (e. g. type of antibody, concentration) through a combination of vertical lines in a "bar code", "informationally addressable" mode and not in a 2 D, spatially addressable mode like in the classical microarrays...|$|E

Germination energy was determined 2 and 21 months after harvest. The highest germination energy (2 months after harvest) was determined when the treatment was made 35 days after flowering (DAF), at the seed moisture of 14 %. However, results showed that desiccation could be performed earlier, from the seed moisture of 40 %, because at that time seed already reached high germination energy (> 85 %), and no significant loss was determined at testing 21 mounts after harvest. Regression analysis showed significant impact of seed moisture at the time of desiccation on germination energy.

40|$|The exact {{segmentation}} of nucleus and plasma of a {{white blood}} cell (leukocyte) {{is the basis for}} the creation of an automatic, image based differential white blood cell count(WBC). In this contribution we present an approach for the according segmentation of leukocytes. For a valid classification of the different cell classes, a precise segmentation is essential. Especially concerning immature cells, which can be distinguished from their mature counterparts only by small differences in some features, a segmentation of nucleus and plasma has to be as precise as possible, to extract those differences. Also the problems with adjacent erythrocyte cells and the usage of a LED illumination are considered. The presented approach can be separated into several steps. After preprocessing by a Kuwahara-filter, the cell is localized by a simple thresholding operation, afterwards a fast-marching method for the localization of a rough cell boundary is defined. To retrieve the cell area a shortest-path-algorithm is applied next. The cell boundary found by the fast-marching approach is finally enhanced by a post-processing step. The concluding segmentation of the cell nucleus is done by a threshold operation. An evaluation of the presented method was done on a representative sample set of 80 images recorded with LED illumination and a 63 -fold magnification <b>dry</b> <b>objective.</b> The automatically segmented cell images are compared to a manual segmentation of the same dataset using the Dice-coefficient as well as Hausdorff-distance.

Bacteriol. 82 : 556 – 563. 1961. —The intracellular distribution of mineral matter throughout the life history of Bacillus cereus strain C 3 was investigated by microincineration {{for which the}} term spodography is suggested. The organism was grown in microcultures on collodion membranes supported by agar media. At various stages of development, microcultures were floated on distilled water, picked onto cover glasses, air-dried, and incinerated at 500 to 525 C. The mineral residue is deposited in situ and shows the distribution of mineral matter in the cells. Study of the spodograms thus obtained shows that in the spore mineral matter is concentrated in a peripheral layer surrounding a minerally poor core. As soon as the spore begins to germinate, often before one notes any change in its optical properties, the minerally rich layer increases in thickness while the core becomes gradually smaller and finally disappears. The germ cell appears nearly homogeneous, with evidence of mineral aggregation into discrete granules more readily seen in subsequent generations. The nuclei of the vegetative cells are sites of mineral accumulation. In the compound nuclei, minerals seem to be concentrated in a superficial ring around a minerally poor center. In the young forespore, mineral matter is homogeneously distributed. As the spore stage is approached, however, the mineral matter tends to occupy a peripheral position as in the completed spore. The {{results indicate that the}} calcium dipicolinate of the spore is principally in the minerally rich, peripheral layer. The relation of this layer to the other peripheral structures of the spore has not been determined.

In Study II, 41 randomly selected fragile old people, residents at three different community care centers, participated. In both studies, the questionnaire OHIP- 14 was used for measurement of oral health-related quality of life.

For <b>objective</b> <b>dry</b> mouth measurements, saliva was absorbed into a preweighted cotton roll. Results: In Study I, 21 % of the respondents stated that they had no oral problems that had a negative impact on their well-being. In Study II, the corresponding figure was 71 %. In study I the mean value for OHIP- 14 was 6. 4 (SD= 7. 1) for the entire population; 5. 9 (SD= 7. 1) for men and 6. 8 (SD= 7. 2) for women in.

40|$|Jatropha press cake, {{by-product}} after oil expression from Jatropha seeds, contains 24 – 28 % protein on <b>dry</b> basis. <b>Objectives</b> of {{this research}} were to investigate functional properties, such as solubility, emulsifying, foaming, film forming, and adhesive properties, of Jatropha press cake proteins and compared those with relevant industrial proteins. From our study, we found that protein extracted from press cake proteins had a solubility of about 90 % above pH 9. Emulsifying properties of press cake protein were comparable to sodium caseinates and reached the highest value at pH 9 – 10. Jatropha proteins formed films with tensile strength of 0. 4 – 1. 8 MPa with 10 – 75 % elongation, which were below soy protein or wheat-gluten. Further oil removal from press cake decreased emulsifying properties, while increased foaming and adhesive properties of the extracted proteins. Protein extracted from de-oiled press cake showed better foaming properties than sodium caseinate at pH 10, but lower than egg white protein at all pH. Furthermore, press cake protein showed better adhesive properties than casein adhesives at the same dry matter content. Based on these results, Jatropha press cake protein showed most promising results on adhesive and emulsifying properties, which indicate the potential of Jatropha press cake protein as emulsifier or paper adhesive...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a {{modified}} hot air dryer by using leaf stove (MHAD_LS) was proposed for banana <b>drying.</b> The <b>objectives</b> {{of this research}} were to evaluate {{the efficiency of the}} leaf stove and the performance of MHAD_LS. The MHAD_LS system consisted of a drying chamber, heat exchanger in dryer, leaf stove and control system for using the speed adjustment on leaf feed motor and air feed motor to serve the thermal load. There were two experiments in this work. The first experiment was used to test the efficiency of the stove. It was found that the system efficiency was 18. 68 %. And the second experiment was used to find the performance of MHAD_LS which was performed in a partial-loop dryer at a drying air temperature and air velocity of 60 oC and 0. 65 ms- 1 respectively. The recycle air ratio was 90 %. It was found that the product capacity of 30 kg with the initial moisture at 250. 10 %dry basis and the resulting final moisture at 63 %dry basis used time 22 hours. The leaf amount of Indian almond for using in the experiment was 44. 96 kg, the total electric power consumption was 3. 64 kWh and an average drying rate was 0. 73 kgwater h- 1...|$|R
40|$|During seed {{extraction}} in fleshy fruits, some {{procedures are}} necessary to ensure seed quality and minimize deterioration and microorganism activity; also seeds extracted under moist conditions need special care when <b>drying.</b> The <b>objective</b> {{of this study was}} to evaluate the physiological quality of eggplant seeds submitted to different extraction and drying methods. In the first study, whole eggplant fruits were mechanically crushed and then fermented for 0, 24 and 48 hours, with and without applying hydrochloric acid during seed extraction. In the second study, seeds were extracted in a pepper peeler and then immediately washed in water and submitted to the following drying methods: Sun/ 24 h; Sun/ 48 h; 32 °C/ 24 h; 32 °C/ 48 h; 38 °C/ 24 h; 38 °C/ 48 h; Sun/ 24 h + 32 °C/ 24 h; Sun/ 24 h + 38 °C/ 24 h e 32 °C/ 24 h + 38 °C/ 24 h. The treatment efficiency of both experiments was evaluated from the following tests: seed weight, germination, first count, accelerated aging and seedling emergence. The results suggest that fermentation and applying hydrochloric acid to pulp/seed reduce the physiological seed quality. All drying methods reduced the seed moisture content permitting adequate storage and maintenance of seed physiological quality...|$|R
