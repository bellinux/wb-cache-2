40|$|BACKGROUND: Liver {{fibrosis}} is {{the common}} pathologic consequence of all chronic liver diseases. AIM: Lactoferrin (Lf) was investigated for its possible hepatoprotective effect against thioacetamide (TAA) -induced liver fibrosis rat model. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Rats received TAA (200 mg/kg/biweekly, ip) for four successive weeks. Lf (200 mg/kg/day, p. o.) or vehicle (VHC) was administered for one month before and another month during TAA <b>injection.</b> <b>Body</b> weight and mortality rate were assessed {{during the month of}} TAA-intoxication. Thereafter, serum and liver tissues were analyzed for liver function, oxidative, fibrotic and apoptotic markers. RESULTS: Lf conserved rats against TAA-induced body weight-loss and mortality. Preservation of serum albumin, alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin levels was also observed. Lf also protected rats against TAA-induced decrease in reduced glutathione and increase in malondialdehyde liver contents. Normal liver contents of hydroxyproline, nuclear factor kappa B and alpha fetoprotein; as markers of fibrosis; were increased with TAA and conserved with Lf-TAA. Lf maintained the normal architecture of the liver and immunohistochemical findings revealed increase in apoptotic bodies compared to TAA that favored necrosis.

There was a slight stimulation of body weight gain in chickens receiving 50 μg/day cGH. In general, cGH produces a transient stimulation of body weight gain in chickens. hpGRF was also given to 4 -week-old cockerels for 14 days via daily iv injection at 0. 1, 1. 0, and 10. 0 μg/day. hpGRF at 0. 1 μg/bird daily increased body weight on day 14 (9. 1 % over the control value). The stimulating effects of hpGRF on body weight are also transient. The effects of cGH on serum somatomedin-C (SM-C) were examined. Serum SM-C concentrations were significantly elevated 24 and 36 h after injection of cGH. In conclusion, purified cGH and hpGRF appear to have some growth-promoting activity.

This study aimed to investigate whether combination of thalidomide modulated the toxicities of CPT- 11 using a rat model and the possible role of the altered pharmacokinetic component in the toxicity modulation using in vitro models. The toxicity model was constructed by treatment of healthy rats with CPT- 11 at 60 mg/kg per day by intravenous (i. v.) <b>injection.</b> <b>Body</b> weight, acute and delayed-onset diarrhea, blood cell counts, and macroscopic and microscopic intestinal damages were monitored in rats treated with CPT- 11 alone or combined therapy with thalidomide at 100 mg/kg administered by intraperitoneal (i. p.) injection. Single dose and 5 -day multiple-dose studies were conducted in rats {{to examine the effects}} of concomitant thalidomide on the plasma pharmacokinetics of CPT- 11 and its major metabolites SN- 38 and SN- 38 glucuronide (SN- 38 G). The effect of CPT- 11 on thalidomide 2 ̆ 7 s pharmacokinetics was also checked. Rat liver microsomes and a rat hepatoma cell line, H 4 -II-E cells, were used to study the in vitro metabolic interactions between these two drugs. H 4 -II-E cells were also used to investigate the effect of thalidomide and its hydrolytic products on the transport of CPT- 11 and SN- 38. In addition, the effect of thalidomide and its hydrolytic products on rat plasma protein binding of CPT- 11 and SN- 38 was examined. Administration of CPT- 11 by i. v. for 4 consecutive days to rats induced significant body weight loss, decrease in neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, severe acute- and delayed-onset diarrhea, and intestinal damages. These toxicities were alleviated when CPT- 11 was combined with thalidomide. In both single-dose and 5 -day multiple-dose pharmacokinetic study, coadministered thalidomide significantly increased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of CPT- 11, but the AUC and elimination half-life (t(1 / 2)) of SN- 38 were significantly decreased. However, CPT- 11 did not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of thalidomide. Thalidomide at 25 and 250 microM and its hydrolytic products at a total concentration of 10 microM had no significant effect on the plasma protein binding of CPT- 11 and SN- 38, except for that thalidomide at 250 microM caused a significant increase in the unbound fraction (f(u)) of CPT- 11 by 6. 7...|$|E

Introduction: Intestinal mucositis (IM) {{is a common}} limiting side effect of anticancer therapy with irinotecan. Previous studies have reported the involvement of cytokines, such as TNF-&# 945;, IL- 1 &# 946; e IL- 18 in the pathogenesis of irinotecan-induced IM, besides demonstrating that nonselective inhibitors of cytokines such as pentoxifylline, attenuate chemotherapy-induced IM. The role of cytokines is well established {{in the context of}} inflammatory bowel disease. It is used in clinical practice treatments that target inflammatory cascade components, for example, the anti-TNF monoclonal antibody, infliximab, which has a beneficial effect in the treatment of Crohnâs disease, rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. There is a lack of information regarding the effect of selective cytokine target therapy on anticancer drug toxicity. Aims: To investigate the protective role of a selective TNF-&# 945; inhibitor, infliximab, on irinotecan-induced IM. Methods: C 57 BL&# 61487; 6 mice were divided into groups (n= 5 - 9) and treated for 4 days with saline (5 mL/kg, i. p.) or irinotecan (75 mg/kg/ 4 days, i. p) or were given infliximabe (5 mg/kg, e. v, single dose) 1 hour before the first irinotecan <b>injection.</b> <b>Body</b> weight and mortality were assessed daily. On the 5 th day the diarrhea was evaluated using scores and the blood was collected for white blood cell count (WBC). After euthanasia, samples of duodenum was collected for myeloperoxydase assay, tissue IL- 1 &# 946; dosage, western blot (WB) of the inducible nitric oxide synthase, morphometric analysis and in vitro evaluation of duodenal contractility. Results: Irinotecan induced IM demonstrated by the significant (p 0, 05). Conclusion: The results suggest {{for the first time the}} proeminent anti-inflammatory effect of the target therapy anti-TNF-&# 945; with infliximab on irinotecan-induced IM.

No 5 o dia avaliou-se a diarrÃia por escores, o leucograma e, apÃs sacrifÃcio, coletou-se o duodeno para dosagem da atividade de mieloperoxidase (MPO) e de IL- 1 &# 946;, expressÃo de Ãxido nÃtrico sintase induzida (iNOS), anÃlise de escores histopatolÃgicos, morfometria e contratilidade in vitro ao carbacol. Resultados: Os animais tratados com irinotecano apresentaram mucosite intestinal, evidenciada por aumento significativo (p 0, 05). ConclusÃes: Os resultados mostram o proeminente efeito antiinflamatÃrio da terapia anti TNF-&# 945; com infliximabe na MI induzida por irinotecano. Tal droga, no entanto, nÃo foi capaz de alterar a sobrevida e de proteger contra a disfunÃÃo na MI experimental por irinotecano. Adicionalmente, acentuou a leucopenia induzida pelo irinotecano, o que pode aumentar o risco de complicaÃÃes infecciosas. Introduction: Intestinal mucositis (IM) is a common limiting side effect of anticancer therapy with irinotecan. Previous studies have reported the involvement of cytokines, such as TNF-&# 945;, IL- 1 &# 946; e IL- 18 in the pathogenesis of irinotecan-induced IM, besides demonstrating that nonselective inhibitors of cytokines such as pentoxifylline, attenuate chemotherapy-induced IM. The role of cytokines is well established in the context of inflammatory bowel disease. It is used in clinical practice treatments that target inflammatory cascade components, for example, the anti-TNF monoclonal antibody, infliximab, which has a beneficial effect in the treatment of Crohnâs disease, rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. There is a lack of information regarding the effect of selective cytokine target therapy on anticancer drug toxicity. Aims: To investigate the protective role of a selective TNF-&# 945; inhibitor, infliximab, on irinotecan-induced IM. Methods: C 57 BL&# 61487; 6 mice were divided into groups (n= 5 - 9) and treated for 4 days with saline (5 mL/kg, i. p.) or irinotecan (75 mg/kg/ 4 days, i. p) or were given infliximabe (5 mg/kg, e. v, single dose) 1 hour before the first irinotecan <b>injection.</b> <b>Body</b> weight and mortality were assessed daily. On the 5 th day the diarrhea was evaluated using scores and the blood was collected for white blood cell count (WBC). After euthanasia, samples of duodenum was collected for myeloperoxydase assay, tissue IL- 1 &# 946; dosage, western blot (WB) of the inducible nitric oxide synthase, morphometric analysis and in vitro evaluation of duodenal contractility. Results: Irinotecan induced IM demonstrated by the significant (p 0, 05). Conclusion: The results suggest for the first time the proeminent anti-inflammatory effect of the target therapy anti-TNF-&# 945; with infliximab on irinotecan-induced IM. However, such treatment did not alter the survival and did not protect against intestinal dysfunction in irinotecan-induced IM. Additionally accentuated leukopenia induced by irinotecan, which can increase the risk of infections...|$|E

40|$|Pyridoxine {{is used as}} a {{supplement}} for treating conditions such as vitamin deficiency as well as neurological disorders such as depression, epilepsy and autism. A significant neurologic complication of pyridoxine therapy is peripheral neuropathy thought to be a result of long-term and high dose usage. Although pyridoxine-induced neuropathy is transient and can remit after its withdrawal, the process of complete recovery can be slow. Glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCP II) inhibition has been shown to improve symptoms of both chemotherapy- and diabetic-induced neuropathy. This study evaluated if GCP II inhibition could behaviorally and physiologically improve pyridoxine-induced neuropathy. In the current study, high doses of pyridoxine (400 mg/kg, twice a day for seven days) were used to induce neuropathy in rats. An orally bioavailable GCP II inhibitor, 2 -(3 -mercaptopropyl) pentanedioic acid (2 -MPPA), was administered daily at a dose of 30 mg/kg starting from the onset of pyridoxine <b>injections.</b> <b>Body</b> weight, motor coordination, heat sensitivity, electromyographical (EMG) parameters and nerve morphological features were monitored. The results show beneficial effects of GCP II inhibition including normalization of hot plate reaction time, foot fault improvements and increased open field distance travelled.

Lastly, GCP II inhibition resulted in morphological protection in the spinal cord and sensory fibers in the lumbar region dorsal root ganglia (DRG).

40|$|Rangeland goat bucks {{were used}} to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of a commercially available anti-gonadotrophin-releasing hormone vaccine, Improvac (Zoetis Australia, West Ryde, NSW, Australia). The hypothesis tested was that immunisation would suppress testosterone secretion by the testis and agonistic behaviour between male goats. We also compared intervals of 2 and 4 weeks between primary and booster immunisations and monitored responses over a 2 -month period. The 45 goats were split into three groups (n = 15) : one group receiving the vaccination booster on Day 14, one group receiving the vaccination booster on Day 28, and the Control group receiving sterile saline <b>injections.</b> <b>Body</b> mass, body condition score and scrotal circumference were measured fortnightly, and blood was collected at 2 -week intervals and analysed for testosterone concentration. Behavioural interaction tests of 2 -min duration were also conducted fortnightly. There was a significant decrease in paired testicular circumference (P < 0. 05) and testosterone concentration (P < 0. 01) in both vaccination groups {{by the end of the}} experiment at Day 60, compared with the Control group. Agonistic interactions measured at Day 60 were significantly reduced in both vaccination groups (P < 0. 05) compared with the Control group. These results support the efficacy of Improvac in reducing agonistic behaviours in rangeland goat bucks and suggest that the use of the vaccine may assist in reducing social stress and possible injury in groups of confined male goats...|$|R
