The crane was used for loading cargo, in particular steam locomotives, onto ships to be exported around the world.|$|E
25|$|From 19 September 1967 to 8 April 1968, Forrestal {{underwent}} repairs in Norfolk Naval Shipyard, {{beginning with}} {{removal of the}} starboard deck-edge elevator, which was stuck in place. It had to be cut from the ship while being supported by the shipyard's <b>hammerhead</b> <b>crane.</b> The carrier occupied drydock number 8 from 21 September 1967, until 10 February 1968, displacing USS John King, an oil tanker, and a mine sweeper that were occupying the drydock. During the post-fire refit, the ship's four aft 5"/54 caliber Mark 42 guns were removed. The forward four guns had been removed prior to 1962.|$|E

40|$|AbstractFailures of the cranes’ {{structural}} parts unavoidably lead to serious damages or total collapses; these accidents are often followed by very high financial losses and possibly serious injuries or crane-related fatalities. The {{objective of this}} research was to identify the causes that led to the failure of the <b>hammerhead</b> tower <b>crane</b> (xl 425 C) counterjib. The crane is used for assembly works at the hydropower dam. The counterjib collapse resulted from a gusset plate failure and caused such significant damage of the whole crane structure that the crane was dismantled and removed from operation. The study of the accident includes: (1) Identification of the stress-state, where a FEM model is developed to provide a useful tool for studying stress analysis; (2) Laboratory investigations are conducted in order to define the chemical composition and mechanical properties of the material, the tensile properties, hardness, impact toughness, as well as the metallographic analyses. The analysis of the obtained results showed that the principal reasons behind the gusset plate failure originated from design and fabrication faults. The working stress was higher than the allowable one. Also, impact toughness was too low and the fabrication of welds was incorrect...|$|R

50|$|In August 2013, the Federal Government {{announced}} {{the removal of}} the <b>hammerhead</b> <b>crane,</b> at an estimated cost of $10.3 million. Other options, such as preserving the crane as a heritage structure and tourist attraction, restoring it to working order, or converting it to a new purpose, were ruled out due to cost and the risk to security at the naval base. The removal was also seen as necessary to free up wharf space for the Canberra-class amphibious warfare ships. The <b>Hammerhead</b> <b>Crane</b> was the largest crane in the southern hemisphere on completion, and as of 2005, was still the largest crane in Australia. At the time of its demolition, it was only 15 cranes of that style worldwide. Removal was scheduled to be completed by November 2014, with some components preserved for heritage purposes.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>hammerhead</b> <b>crane</b> {{was built}} between 1944 and 1951 on the Fitting Out Wharf at Garden Island. The {{electrically}} powered crane had a radius of 131 ft {{and a total}} height of 203 ft. The electrical and mechanical equipment was sourced from England, while the steel frame was fabricated in Sydney. Although officially declared completed in January 1952, the crane was operational from March 1951. The crane's primary purpose was the removal and installation of warship gun turrets, although it was regularly used for other machinery and loads, and had a lifting capacity of up to [...] It was last used in 1996.|$|E
50|$|Manette (Now {{also known}} as part of East Bremerton) was linked to Bremerton by the Manette Bridge, a 1573 ft bridge {{constructed}} in June 1930. Prior to this time, the trip could only be made by ferry or a long trip around Dyes Inlet through Chico, Silverdale, and Tracyton on mostly unimproved roads. This wooden bridge was replaced with a concrete and steel structure in October 1949. It {{was replaced by the}} new Manette Bridge in 2011. At the shipyard, the 250 ft tall <b>Hammerhead</b> <b>Crane</b> No. 28 was completed in April 1933. One of the nation's largest, it is capable of lifting 250 tons and continues to dominate the Bremerton skyline.|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} Hammerkran evolved first in Germany {{around the turn}} of the 19th century and was adopted and {{developed}} for use in British shipyards to support the battleship construction program from 1904 to 1914. The ability of the <b>hammerhead</b> <b>crane</b> to lift heavy weights was useful for installing large pieces of battleships such as armour plate and gun barrels. Giant cantilever cranes were also installed in naval shipyards in Japan and in the United States. The British government also installed a giant cantilever crane at the Singapore Naval Base (1938) and later a copy of the crane was installed at Garden Island Naval Dockyard in Sydney (1951). These cranes provided repair support for the battle fleet operating far from Great Britain.|$|E
50|$|The iconic 50 m yellow <b>hammerhead</b> <b>crane</b> at Buccleuch Dock was a Barrow {{landmark}} {{for over}} 60-years up until its demolition in 2011. Assembled in 1942, it replaced a similar crane that was destroyed the year previous during the Barrow Blitz, killing two watchmen in the process. It {{was used to}} fit out such vessels as HMS Invincible and SS Oriana, and finally HMS Albion in 2001. Safety concerns and lack of usage in the early 2010s lead to the cranes' future coming under scrutiny. Despite calls for the structure to become listed, it was ultimately dismantled. A scale replica of the crane is now situated on the site acting as a memorial to those killed during the World War II bombing of the shipyard.|$|E
50|$|Under Clark Woodward's {{watch as}} commandant, the U.S. Navy also {{undertook}} an accelerated upgrading {{and expansion of}} the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The entire physical plant was overhauled, all of its older factories (many dating {{as far back as}} the Civil War) remodeled and repaired. A huge new turret shop was built, and a mammoth <b>Hammerhead</b> <b>crane,</b> capable of lifting 350 tons, was constructed to capacitate battleship fabrication. Forcing rights of condemnation under eminent domain, the yard took over the old Wallabout Market abutting it to the east, using the expanded space to build two additional 1100-foot dry docks, a new foundry, several subassembly shops, and a materials laboratory. Under Woodward's oversight, additional docks and berths were constructed on the East River, and miles of roads and railroad tracks were added to interconnect the upgraded facility.|$|E

50|$|On 31 July, Forrestal {{arrived at}} Naval Air Station Cubi Point in the Philippines, to {{undertake}} repairs sufficient {{to allow the}} ship {{to return to the}} United States. With repairs completed, she departed on 11 August, arriving at Naval Station Mayport on 12 September to disembark the remaining aircraft and air group personnel stationed in Florida. Two days later, Forrestal finally returned to Norfolk to be welcomed home by over 3,000 family members and friends of the crew, gathered on Pier 12 and onboard , Forrestals host ship.From 19 September 1967 to 8 April 1968, Forrestal underwent repairs in Norfolk Naval Shipyard, beginning with removal of the starboard deck-edge elevator, which was stuck in place.

50|$|SpaceX {{intends to}} utilize the Fixed Service Structure (FSS) of the Pad 39A launch towers, and will extend it above its {{existing}} 350 ft height, but will not need the Rotating Service Structure (RSS) and will remove it. Initial plans in 2014 called for leaving the RSS in place until after the first Falcon Heavy launch; however, plans were changed, and work on RSS takedown began in February 2016. NASA has already removed the Orbiter Servicing Arm and white room by which astronauts entered the Space Shuttle. SpaceX indicated in late 2014 that no additional levels to the FSS would be added in the near term. SpaceX plans to later add at least two additional levels to the FSS, and will utilize the FSS for providing crew access for the Dragon V2 launches. Launch vehicles will be assembled horizontally in a hangar near the pad, transferred to the pad, and then lifted atop a launch platform {{for the remainder of}} the launch prep and lift off. For military missions from Pad 39A, payloads will be vertically integrated, as that is required per launch contract with the US Air Force. A <b>hammerhead</b> <b>crane</b> will be added to the FSS in order to support US military requirements for vertical payload integration.|$|E
5000|$|Q-Ball cover: A {{styrofoam}} cover, {{removed a}} few seconds before launch, protected the pitot tubes from being clogged by debris. [...] The cover was split in half vertically and held together by a 2 in rubber band. A razor blade was positioned behind the rubber band, pinched between the halves of the cover. A wire cable was connected to {{the top and bottom of}} the razor blade and to both halves of the cover. The cable was routed through a pulley on the <b>hammerhead</b> <b>crane</b> at the top of the launch umbilical tower (LUT) down to a tube on the right side of the 360 ft level of the LUT. The cable was connected to a cylindrical weight inside a tube. The weight rested on a lever controlled by a pneumatic solenoid valve. When the valve was actuated from the Launch Control Center (LCC), the pneumatic pressure of 600 PSI GN2 (nitrogen gas) rotated the lever down allowing the weight to drop down the tube. The dropping weight pulled the cable, which pulled the blade cutting the rubber band, and the cable pulled the halves of the cover away from the launch vehicle. The apparent overengineering of this safety system was due to the fact that the launch escape system, which depended on the Q-ball data, was armed 5 minutes before launch, so retraction of the Q-ball cover was a life-critical part of a possible pad abort.|$|E
