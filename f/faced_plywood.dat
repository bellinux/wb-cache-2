40|$|Concrete {{durability}} {{is dependent}} upon {{the quality of the}} concrete cover zone. The type of mould release technology used, has a direct effect on the surface finish of the formation of fair faced concrete, and this in turn affects long term durability and surface finish. This paper examines two mould release agents, one permeable formwork liner and Type 1 polypropylene fibres used with a single mould release agent. Cubes were cast in film <b>faced</b> <b>plywood</b> moulds using a C 40 concrete that enabled comparisons to be drawn between the mould release agents. The range of variables tested comprised of, two (FS and CL) commercially available solvent based mould release agents (MRA), permeable formwork and C 1 used with polypropylene fibres. The results showed that the controlled permeability formwork (CPF) liner produced the fewest blowholes and was the best performing technology used in that respect. As a consequence of this, CPF provided the most likely finish that would provide long term durability. None of the technologies employed produced a completely uniform colour throughout, however the CL MRA cubes and polypropylene fibre reinforced cubes produced the most consistent colouring...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a {{total of}} five {{structural}} insulated panel shear walls (SIPSW), in which with <b>plywood</b> <b>facing</b> and polystyrene foam board core, were tested under low cyclic horizontal loading. For the test specimens, different wall depth-width ratio and the opening sizes have been considered. The failure modes, failure mechanics, bearing capacity, lateral stiffness and ductility are discussed in detail. The test results showed that the hysteretic curve of SIPSW shows a reversed S-shape. Also the depth-to-width ratio and the opening dimensions of the shear walls have significant effects on load bearing capacity, ductility and elastic stiffness. What’s more, the performance of the SIPSW specimens was controlled by the fastener slip behavior of the SIP-to-spline connection, especially along the bottom spline. Finally, it is indicated that SIPSW have a good satisfaction upon seismic performance when used to timber structures...|$|R

50|$|The overall {{dimensions}} of the RCL were 52 ft bow to stern, and 18 ft beam. The cargo well (or tank deck) was 35 ft long. The bow ramp was lowered and raised by two hand winches. The ramp was built of <b>plywood</b> <b>faced</b> with steel and hinged to steel receiving plates on the bow. The framework of the RCL was constructed of appropriate Canadian timbers {{and covered with a}} seven-ply marine plywood, Sylvaply weather-board. The craft weighed 25 tons, and had a carrying capacity of 35 tons It was designed to carry ordnance and troops, as well as do general lighterage work where dock facilities were not available. They were capable of carrying tanks, troops, and loaded trucks ashore in very shallow water. Watertight compartments in the hull construction enabled these boats to take a great deal of punishment without losing buoyancy.|$|R
40|$|New {{construction}} {{represents a}} significant portion of the total energy consumed by the building sector. One approach for reducing the energy impact of new construction is to utilize composite materials. Structural insulated panels (SIPs) are stressed-skin panels composed of an energy-efficient core such as expanded polystyrene (EPS) paired with either traditional or novel <b>facing</b> materials including <b>plywood,</b> oriented strandboard (OSB), cement mortar, or steel. Currently SIPs are underutilized in residential construction, which instead predominantly employs timber-framing methods including sheathed timber shear walls. While the seismic performance of the latter has been extensively studied and incorporated into building codes, there is considerably less information available about the general behavior of SIPs, especially regarding their behavior when subjected to seismic loads. This paper focuses on the characterization of the mechanical properties and seismic performance of SIPs using experimental techniques. Specimens studied include both OSB-faced and cementitious SIPs, where panels were tested without panel-to-panel connections...|$|R
40|$|This article shows {{numerical}} {{investigations of}} composite sandwich plywood plates with birch <b>plywood</b> <b>faces</b> and {{a core of}} straight and curved plywood honeycomb-type ribs in comparison to standard plywood plates and other core type plates. This shape of core ribs provides several improvements for these plates in manufacturing process as well as mechanical properties. The influence of core element shapes on stiffness in longitudinal direction of a plate is insignificant although {{it is possible to}} vary with stiffness in transverse direction of these plates by changing form of plate’s ribs. The results are describable as specific strength or stiffness (stiffness to mass or strength to mass ratio etc.) in both directions. The various results depending on chosen variables (according to strength-stiffness criteria) plywood composite macrostructure is obtained for one span plate with uniformly distributed loading. The results show {{that it is possible to}} reduce material consumption causing reduction in stiffness but in general increasing stiffness to weight ratio for about 30 % or even more if it is possible to increase height of a plate more than maximum standard plywood plate. All thicknesses of elements are chosen according to plywood supplier assortment. A various thicknesses of plywood sheets (0 / 90 / 0 + 90 / 0 ·n) are taken for straight ribs as well as various plates coverings for waved part of ribs the 3 layer plywood was taken (90 / 0 / 90) or (0 / 90 / 0) due to simplification of manufacturing process.

40|$|The {{simplest}} type of sandwich composite {{consists of}} two, thin, stiff strong sheets of dense material {{separated by a}} thick layer of low density material. The first major structure to incorporate sandwich panels was the Second World War "Mosquito aircraft" which consisted of a balsa wood core with <b>plywood</b> <b>faces.</b> The cellular materials used for sandwich core applications can generally be divided into two categories; honeycomb structures and polymer foams. Other cellular cores which exist are balsa wood and corrugated cores. Honeycomb materials generally have a hexagonal cellular shape, and are the core material of choice for advanced composites, In this thesis it was the aim to prepare open-cellular PolyHIPE foam core materials by the polymerisation of the continuous phase of a high internal phase emulsion (HIRE). To assess whether PolyHIPE materials are viable as core materials their flexural, compressive and shear properties were evaluated against the current commercially used core materials. It was shown {{that it was possible to}} improve the flexural, compressive and shear properties of a styrene/DVB PolyHIPE material by the addition of fibres to the material and the use of an optimised surfactant system (OSS). It was also shown that by the addition of monomers such as; butyl acrylate, 2 -ethylhexyl acrylate, butyl methacrylate and methyl methacrylate to the monomer phase that the compressive properties of the S/DVB material could be varied. It was also possible to prepare a fibre-free and fibre-reinforced resorcinol- formaldehyde-based material, which had greater compressive and shear properties compared to the styrene/DVB material. Also a PolyHIPE material containing poly (ϵ-caprolactone) diacrylate showed shape-memory properties and an elongated cell structure after deformation and cooling. This elongated cell structure could lead to possible anisotropic behaviour. Finally it was concluded that the best mechanically performing PolyHIPE materials prepared competed well with the shear and compressive strength of the commercial honeycomb and foam core materials examined.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the prediction of}} opposed flow flame spread in the Fire Dynamics Simulator version 4 (FDS 4) Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model by adapting the Lateral Ignition Flame Transport (LIFT) test procedure. It {{should be noted that}} FDS 4 was all that was available {{at the time of the}} analysis despite FDS 5 is now available for beta testing. This research follows on from previous work where LIFT experiments were conducted for various New Zealand timber and timber based products; those materials include Beech, Macrocarpa, Radiata Pine, Rimu, Hardboard, Medium Density Fibreboard (MDF), Melteca <b>faced</b> MDF, <b>Plywood</b> and Particle Board. The objective of this research is to investigate the accuracy of flame spread modelling in FDS 4; where the prediction of opposed flow flame spread parameters from FDS 4 were directly compared with the experimental results that were obtained experimentally. The standardised procedure for determining the material ignition and flame spread properties was followed and applied to simulate the LIFT test. The LIFT test apparatus was set up in FDS 4 with a domain size of 0. 9 x 0. 3 x 0. 3 metres in the x, y and z directions respectively. From the heat flux distribution along the calibration specimen, it indicated that calibration of the LIFT apparatus can be executed in FDS 4 where the percentage error is within 1. 2 %. This report also provides the thermal transport properties (i. e. thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity) of the tested New Zealand timber and timber based products. These were determined using a transient plane source technique and subsequently these properties were entered as the surface identifications in FDS 4. The ignition tests were not performed as part of the simulated LIFT test since a direct comparison with the results was required to give a more meaningful assessment. For this reason, the ignition parameters that were obtained from the previous experiments were employed to carry out the flame spread test. Due to the concept of a preheat time required by the standard test method and FDS 4 being not able to preheat specimens, the temperature immediately after the preheat time was calculated and implemented for the specimens. The heat transfer problem was solved using an explicit method; where specimens were divided into 11 different nodes. Different scenarios were investigated to see the effect that the selected combustion model has on modelling flame spread. The two analytical models tested were (1) thermoplastic fuels and (2) charring fuels model. Furthermore, the flame spread was visualised using either the Mixture Fraction or the HRRPUV model in Smokeview; where the rate of flame spread for each specimen was obtained. And lastly, three different absorption coefficients (0. 6, 0. 7 and 0. 8) for each specimen were examined; this parameter contributed significantly to the rate of flame spread as it determines the amount of heat flux being absorbed by the specimen during the time of preheating. A study of the grid size was also performed to investigate the accuracy of the FDS 4 simulations with the grid size selected. It has been found that increasing the size of the grid cell does not greatly affect the flame spread results. Moisture content and heat of vaporisation input variables were also examined. From the flame spread data, moisture content does not have a significant role in modelling flame spread. However, it was indicated that the heat of vaporisation has an effect on the output of the flame spread parameters. It was determined from the sensitivity analysis that the most appropriate solid boundary condition to be used in predicting the flame spread would be thermoplastic fuels model with an absorption coefficient of 0. 8. By using this scenario as the basis, the plot of the arrival time against the distance along the specimen exhibits a similar trend of flame spread with the experimental results at first, but later on, the extinction of flame front actually occurred at a much earlier stage than the experimental results showed. In general, the analyses showed that FDS 4 cannot perform the LIFT test where the prediction of flame heating parameter and minimum heat flux for spread were out by more than 20 % shown by the direct comparison between experimental results. However, the prediction of minimum heat flux required for ignition seems to agree with the experimental results where the percentage error is within 20 %...|$|R
