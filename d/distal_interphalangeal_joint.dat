5|$|Each forelimb of {{the horse}} runs from the scapula or {{shoulder}} blade to the navicular bone. In between are the humerus (arm), radius (forearm), elbow joint, ulna (elbow), carpus (knee) bones and joint, large metacarpal (cannon), small metacarpal (splint), sesamoid, fetlock joint, first phalanx (long pastern), pastern joint, second phalanx (short pastern), coffin joint, outwardly evidenced by the coronary band, and the third phalanx (coffin or pedal) bones. Each hind limb {{of the horse}} runs from the pelvis to the navicular bone. After the pelvis come the femur (thigh), patella, stifle joint, tibia, fibula, tarsal (hock) bone and joint, large metatarsal (cannon) and small metatarsal (splint) bones. Below these, the arrangement of sesamoid and phalanx bones and joints {{is the same as}} in the forelimbs. When the horse is moving, the <b>distal</b> <b>interphalangeal</b> <b>joint</b> (coffin joint) has the highest amount of stresses applied to it of any joint in the body, and it can be significantly affected by trimming and shoeing techniques. Although having a small range of movement, the proximal interphalangeal joint (pastern joint) is also influential to the movement of the horse, and can change the way that various shoeing techniques affect tendons and ligaments in the legs. Due to the horse's development as a cursorial animal (one whose main form of defense is running), its bones evolved to facilitate speed in a forward direction over hard ground, without the need for grasping, lifting or swinging. The ulna shrank in size and its top portion became the point of the elbow, while the bottom fused with the radius above the radiocarpal (knee) joint, which corresponds to the wrist in humans. A similar change occurred in the fibula bone of the hind limbs. These changes were first seen in the genus Merychippus, approximately 17 million years ago.|$|E

50|$|Boutonniere {{deformity}} is a deformed {{position of}} the fingers or toes, in which the joint nearest the knuckle (the proximal interphalangeal joint, or PIP) is permanently bent toward the palm while the farthest joint (the <b>distal</b> <b>interphalangeal</b> <b>joint,</b> or DIP) is bent back away (PIP flexion with DIP hyperextension).

25|$|Both primary {{generalized}} nodal osteoarthritis and erosive osteoarthritis (EOA, {{also called}} inflammatory osteoarthritis) are sub-sets of primary osteoarthritis.

25|$|In smaller joints, {{such as at}} the fingers, hard bony enlargements, called Heberden's nodes (on the <b>distal</b> <b>interphalangeal</b> <b>joints)</b> or Bouchard's nodes (on the {{proximal}} <b>interphalangeal</b> <b>joints),</b> may form, and though they are not necessarily painful, they do limit {{the movement of the}} fingers significantly. Osteoarthritis of the toes may be a factor causing formation of bunions, rendering them red or swollen.|$|R
50|$|Heberden's nodes {{are hard}} or bony swellings that can {{develop in the}} <b>distal</b> <b>interphalangeal</b> <b>joints</b> (DIP) (the joints closest {{to the end of}} the fingers and toes).

5000|$|In medicine, mallet finger, also {{baseball}} finger, dropped finger, dolphin finger, [...] "Virgin Finger," [...] "Hannan Finger," [...] "PLF Finger," [...] and (more generally) extensor tendon injury, is {{an injury}} of the extensor digitorum tendon {{of the fingers}} at the <b>distal</b> <b>interphalangeal</b> <b>joint</b> (DIP). It results from hyperflexion of the extensor digitorum tendon, and usually occurs when a ball (such as a softball, basketball, volleyball or dodgeball), while being caught, hits an outstretched finger and jams it, creating a ruptured or stretched extensor digitorum tendon.|$|E
5000|$|The Anterior Interosseus Nerve (AIN), {{a branch}} of the median nerve, only {{accounts}} for the movement of the fingers in hand and does not have any sensory capabilities.

Patients suffering from this syndrome have impaired <b>distal</b> <b>interphalangeal</b> <b>joint,</b> because of which they are unable to pinch anything or make and [...] "OK" [...] sign with their index finger and thumb.

50|$|Because the {{rotation}} of P3 is exacerbated by continued pull on the deep digital flexor tendon, one approach to therapy has been to cut this tendon, either in the cannon region (mid-metacarpus) or in the pastern region. Over a time period of 6 weeks, tenotomy is thought to allow P3 to realign with the ground surface. Critics claim that this technique is unsuccessful and invasive, with advocates making counter-arguments that it is often used in cases which are too far advanced for treatment to help. Tenotomy does risk subluxation of the <b>distal</b> <b>interphalangeal</b> <b>joint</b> (coffin joint), which may be avoided {{with the use of}} heel extensions on the shoe. Horses may return to work after the surgery. This treatment is often recommended for severe cases of laminitis, and requires proper trimming and shoeing to be successful.|$|E

5000|$|The claw hand {{deformity}} is {{more prominent}} with injury at the wrist {{as opposed to}} a lesion higher up in the arm, for instance, at the elbow, as the ulnar half of the flexor digitorum profundus is not affected.

50|$|All four non-thumb digits (index finger, middle finger, {{ring finger}} and little finger) contain three bones called the {{phalanges}} that are aligned in a linear row like box cars in a train. These bones are designated the proximal phalanx (closest to the palm), the middle phalanx and the distal phalanx (farthest from the palm). The joints between these bones {{are referred to}} as the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP, between the proximal and middle phalanx) and the <b>distal</b> <b>interphalangeal</b> <b>joint</b> (DIP, between the middle and distal phalanx). Large muscles in the forearm send long tendons to the fingers and these tendons attach at specific points on these bones. Flexing and extending these digits occurs when these muscles contract and their tendons pull on their bony attachments. The deepest of the flexor muscles in the anterior forearm is called the flexor digitorum profundus muscle (FDP); it gives off four tendons that travel through the carpal tunnel into the hand and attach to the distal phalanx {{in each of the four}} non-thumb digits.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The injury of {{the hand}} tendon {{classified}} as mallet finger presents the loss of continuity of the united lateral band of the extensor apparatus above <b>distal</b> <b>interphalangeal</b> <b>joint,</b> which consequently leads to specific deformity of <b>distal</b> <b>interphalangeal</b> <b>joint</b> which is called mallet (hammer) finger. Objective Our paper had several research Objectives: presentation of the existing Results of surgical and nonsurgical treatment of mallet finger deformities and comparison of our findings and other authorsâ€™ Results. Method: The study was retro-prospective, and analyzed 62 patients treated in the Clinical Center of Serbia in Belgrade (at the Institute of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology, and the Emergency Center) in the period 1998 to 2003. The follow up of these patients lasted at least 8 months (from 8. 3 months to 71. 7 months). An average follow up was 28. 7 months. The Objective parameters {{used in the study}} were as follows: sex, age, dominating hand, hand injury, finger injury, mode of treatment, complications, <b>distal</b> <b>interphalangeal</b> <b>joint</b> flexion and total movement of the <b>distal</b> <b>interphalangeal</b> <b>joint.</b> Collected data were analyzed by Ï‡ 2 -test and Studentâ€™s t-test. The confidence interval was p= 0. 05. Results: A total range of motion was 51. 9 Â± 6. 6 for nonsurgically treated patients, and 48. 2 Â± 4. 2 degrees for operated patients. Mean extension deficit of the <b>distal</b> <b>interphalangeal</b> <b>joint</b> was 6. 5 Â± 3. 3 for nonsurgical and 10. 0 Â± 3. 2 for operated patients.
