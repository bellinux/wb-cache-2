50|$|The idea of {{building}} an aviation {{field on the}} site of the Old Saugus Race Track was first proposed in December 1910 by the Aeroplane Company of America. The company proposed spending $100,000 to convert the old race track into an air field and construct a factory for the manufacturing of flying machines. The company also planned to maintain a flight school and hold aviation meets on the site. The company asked the town to extend its water mains to the field, improve its <b>electrical</b> <b>light</b> <b>equipment,</b> keep the roads leading to the field in good condition, and be lenient in the tax assessment of the improved property. The Saugus site was chosen because it consisted of many acres of flat, dry land and open marsh land, there was sufficient room for the construction of new buildings, and the atmospheric conditions were ideal for flying.|$|R

In addition the lower surface temperature of the concrete slab also absorbs radiant heat directly from the occupants, also benefiting their thermal comfort.|$|R

50|$|The {{predominantly}} Muslim population supported Muslim League and Pakistan Movement. After {{the independence}} of Pakistan in 1947, the Muslim refugees from Eastern Punjab and Haryana settled in the Faisalabad District. It initially lacked industry, hospitals and universities. Since independence, there has been industrial growth, and the city's population is continually growing. Notable industry in the district include {{but not limited to}} Textile (spinning, weaving, printing, dying, stitching), Chemicals (acids, caustics, industrial gases, potash, chlorides etc), consumer goods (soaps, vegetable oil, detergents), Engineering (<b>light</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>equipment,</b> engineering goods), Metals & Metallurgy (steels, alloys) and Power (power equipment, power production).|$|R
5000|$|In {{the context}} of {{wireless}} power, energy harvesting, also called power harvesting or energy scavenging, is the conversion of ambient energy from the environment to electric power, mainly to power small autonomous wireless electronic devices. [...] The ambient energy may come from stray electric or magnetic fields or radio waves from nearby <b>electrical</b> <b>equipment,</b> <b>light,</b> thermal energy (heat), or kinetic energy such as vibration or motion of the device. [...] Although the efficiency of conversion is usually low and the power gathered often minuscule (milliwatts or microwatts), it can be adequate to run or recharge small micropower wireless devices such as remote sensors, which are proliferating in many fields. [...] This new technology is being developed to {{eliminate the need for}} battery replacement or charging of such wireless devices, allowing them to operate completely autonomously.|$|R
40|$|Attempts {{to reduce}} the energy {{consumed}} in UK homes have met with limited success. One {{reason for this is}} a lack of understanding of how people interact with domestic technology – heating systems, <b>lights,</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>equipment</b> and so forth. Attaining such an understanding is hampered by a chronic shortage of detailed energy use data matched to descriptions of the house, the occupants, the internal conditions and the installed services and appliances. Without such information it is impossible to produce transparent and valid models for understanding and predicting energy use. The Carbon Reduction in Buildings (CaRB) consortium of five UK universities plans to develop socio-technical models of energy use, underpinned by a flow of data from a longitudinal monitoring campaign involving several hundred UK homes. This paper outlines the models proposed, the preliminary monitoring work and the structure of the proposed longitudinal study...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Whole-building energy models take {{information}} about {{the structure of a}} building, its <b>equipment</b> (<b>electrical</b> loads, <b>lights,</b> conditioning <b>equipment,</b> etc.), and disturbances (people, weather) and predict its year long comfort and energy performance. Both commercial and freely available tools are available for performing these time-domain simulations, which are used for design trade studies and more frequently to check for energy consumption and comfort compliance. These models require hundreds of assumptions as input when it comes to parameterizing the building model. Previous studies have investigated how predictions are influenced by these assumptions and which of the parameters are critical to year-long calculations. In this paper we extend this approach to investigate how parametric uncertainty influences uncertainty in the energy dynamics within a building. We provide a case study that investigates an office building by extracting dynamic information out of an EnergyPlus model, and supplies this information to an automatically generated analytical thermal network model. We conclude with a control-oriented frequency-based robustness assessment as well as a study of how un-certainty influences the network structure of the building by investigating the spectral gap of its graph Laplacian.

40|$|According to the {{international}} agreement, COP, energy efficiency is becoming an important consideration for consumer products. The electric power consumed for lighting is about 20 % of the total electric power consumed in Japan. Appropriate effort is therefore required to develop energy-efficient <b>lighting</b> <b>equipment.</b> The Japan Research and Development Center of Metals (JRCM) has organized a 5 -year R&D project (1998 - 2002) to develop energy-efficient <b>lighting</b> <b>equipment</b> using light-emitting diodes (LEDs), with the participation of thirteen member companies and universities, {{as required by the}} New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO). The current project targets an energy efficiency twice that of traditional fluorescent lamps, through the use of long-life, thin, lightweight, GaN-based high-efficiency blue and ultraviolet LEDs. This <b>lighting</b> <b>equipment</b> would have the following advantages: 1. Less electricity consumption due to high optoelectronic conversion efficiency. 2. Ease of miniaturization due to the small size of the light source [...] the <b>lighting</b> <b>equipment</b> would be smaller, thinner and lighter. 3. Long life. 4.
