In the 2014–15 NBA.com Rookie Survey at the annual Rookie Photo Shoot on August 6, Parker was named by his peers as both {{the most likely to}} be Rookie of the Year and the most likely to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> NBA career.|$|E
5|$|There is a three-tiered {{system for}} histologically {{classifying}} endometrial cancers, ranging from cancers with well-differentiated cells (grade I), to very poorly-differentiated cells (grade III). Grade I cancers {{are the least}} aggressive and <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> prognosis, while grade III tumors are the most aggressive and likely to recur. Grade II cancers are intermediate between grades I and III in terms of cell differentiation and aggressiveness of disease.|$|E
5|$|A {{mathematical}} look at {{the voting}} numbers reveals that Bush {{would have had to}} win 12.55% of Perot's 18.91% of the vote, 66.36% of Perot's support base, to earn a majority of the vote, and would have needed to win nearly every state Clinton won by less than five percentage points. Furthermore, Perot was most popular in states that strongly favored either Clinton or Bush, limiting his real electoral impact for either candidate. He gained relatively little support in the Southern states and happened to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> showing in states with few electoral votes. Perot appealed to disaffected voters all across the political spectrum who had grown weary of the two-party system. Perot's anti-NAFTA stance played a role in his support, and Perot voters were relatively moderate on hot button social issues such as abortion and gay rights.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the award}} {{was created by}} The Bookseller, {{the idea of an}} award celebrating books with odd titles was {{proposed}} by Trevor Bounford of the Diagram Group in order to provide entertainment during the Frankfurt Book Fair in 1978. Originally known as the Diagram Group Prize for the Oddest Title at the Frankfurt Book Fair, any book that was at the fair could be nominated, but other books outside of the fair were also included. In 1982, Horace Bent, diarist for The Bookseller, took over administrative duties. Following two occasions in 1987 and 1991 when no prize was given {{due to a lack of}} odd titles, The Bookseller opened suggestions to the readers of the magazine. In 2000, the winner was voted for by the public instead of being decided by Bent. In 2009, online submissions sent on Twitter were accepted. This resulted in the highest number of submissions for the prize in its history, with 90 books being submitted (50 from Twitter), almost three times the number from the previous year (32). However, Bent also expressed his annoyance at people who gave submissions that broke the rules, with some of the books mentioned being published as far back as 1880. The 2014 prize allowed nominations from self-published works, the first book being Strangers <b>Have</b> <b>the</b> <b>Best</b> Candy by Margaret Meps Schulte, which won the prize.|$|E
5|$|Maribor's {{tally of}} 14 Slovenian Championships {{and the total}} of nine Slovenian Cup titles is the highest in Slovenian football. Maribor holds the record for most {{consecutive}} league titles (7), ahead of Olimpija (4) and Gorica (3). They are also the only team {{in the country that}} has achieved the Slovenian Championship and the Slovenian Cup doubles {{on more than one occasion}} (4). In addition, they are the only club who has won the Slovenian version of the treble, having won the league, cup and supercup during the 2012–13 season. On their official website, UEFA states that Maribor has won one international cup, as Maribor was one of the winners of the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 2006. However, the trophy itself was awarded to Newcastle United, the team that advanced farthest in the UEFA competitions that season. Maribor <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> top-flight record in history, having finished below fourth place only once. In addition, they were the first team to win 1,000 points in Slovenian top flight, achieving that with a 2–1 away victory against Rudar Velenje on 26 July 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} site of {{recurrence}} {{is in the}} vagina; vaginal relapses of endometrial cancer <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> prognosis. If relapse occurs from a cancer {{that has not been}} treated with radiation, EBRT is the first-line treatment and is often successful. If a cancer treated with radiation recurs, pelvic exenteration is the only option for curative treatment. Palliative chemotherapy, cytoreductive surgery, and radiation are also performed. Radiation therapy (VBT and EBRT) for a local vaginal recurrence has a 50% five-year survival rate. Pelvic recurrences are treated with surgery and radiation, and abdominal recurrences are treated with radiation and, if possible, chemotherapy. Other common recurrence sites are the pelvic lymph nodes, para-aortic lymph nodes, peritoneum (28% of recurrences), and lungs, though recurrences can also occur in the brain (<1%), liver (7%), adrenal glands (1%), bones (4–7%; typically the axial skeleton), lymph nodes outside the abdomen (0.4–1%), spleen, and muscle/soft tissue (2–6%).|$|E
50|$|During the offseason, MLB.com ranked Mariners' {{first round}} draft Dustin Ackley as <b>the</b> 15th <b>best</b> {{prospect}} in Minor League Baseball.

Baseball America also ranked players by their specific talents. Ackley was named best hitter for average, Halman was named best hitter for power, and best athlete, outfielder Ezequiel Carrera was named both best strike-zone discipline, and fastest base runner, Pineda was named as <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> fastball, and <b>the</b> <b>best</b> control of pitches, pitcher Josh Fields was named as <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> curveball, pitcher Steven Hensley was named as <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> slider, pitcher Nick Hill was named as <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> changeup, Steve Baron was named <b>the</b> <b>best</b> defensive catcher, Gabriel Noriega was named <b>the</b> <b>best</b> defensive infielder, Triunfel was named as <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> throwing arm amongst infielders, Saunders was named best defensive outfielder, and James Jones was named as <b>the</b> <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> throwing arm amongst outfielders.|$|R

5|$|The {{producers}} found Crispin Bonham-Carter to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> physical {{contrast to}} Firth's Darcy {{and gave him}} his first major television role as the good-natured and wealthy Mr Charles Bingley. Bonham-Carter had originally auditioned for the part of Mr George Wickham, a handsome militia lieutenant whose charm conceals his licentiousness and greed, but Adrian Lukis was cast instead. Anna Chancellor, of Four Weddings and a Funeral fame, played Mr Bingley's sister Caroline Bingley. (Chancellor is also Jane Austen's six-times-great-niece) Mr Bingley's other sister and his brother-in-law were played by Lucy Robinson (Louisa Hurst) and Rupert Vansittart (Mr Hurst). Casting the role of Darcy's young sister, Georgiana, proved hard as the producers {{were looking for a}} young actress who appeared innocent, proud and yet shy, had class and could also play the piano. After auditioning over 70 actresses, Simon Langton suggested Emilia Fox, the real-life daughter of Joanna David (Mrs Gardiner), for the part. Barbara Leigh-Hunt was cast as Darcy's meddling aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, without auditions or screen tests.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus {{describes}} {{the wood of}} different trees, the effects of climate on wood, of knots and 'coiling' in timber and other differences in quality. He discusses which woods to use for specific purposes such as for carpentry, shipbuilding and for building houses, {{and the making of}} charcoal. The most useful trees are said to be silver-fir and fir, and they <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> wood in the largest sizes; the silver-fir is softer than the fir, and its wood has layers like an onion, and is made entirely of these layers. The strongest and most attractive wood is smooth, without knots. In Syria, terebinth wood is dark and close-grained, Theophrastus reports, and used both for the handles of daggers and, turned on the lathe, for making cups. He claims that the hardest timber is of oak and holm oak, while elm warps the least, so it is used for the pivots and sockets of doors, which must be straight. The wood of palms is light and soft like cork-oak, but is tougher and less brittle, so it is good for carving images. Timber from the cedar, ebony, box, olive, oak and sweet chestnut keeps well and resists decay. He asserts that Tamarisk wood from Greece is weak, but from the Arabian island of Tylos it is as strong as kermes-oak. The wood of oak and the knotted parts of fir and silver-fir are described as the hardest to work. Ships are generally made of silver-fir, fir, and Syrian cedar; in Cyprus they use Aleppo pine which is better than the fir that grows there. Theophrastus records that in the lowlands of Italy (the country of the Latins) they grow bay, myrtle and excellent beech trees long enough for the whole length of a ship.|$|E
