40|$|Monitoring {{sediment}} yields from catchments {{is important}} for assessing overall denudation rates {{and the impact of}} environmental change. One of the methods used to assess sediment yield is by quantifying sedimentation rates in reservoirs, lakes or small ponds. Before reliable sediment yield values (t ha(- 1) a(- 1)) can be computed from such sedimentation records, the measured sediment volumes need to be converted to sediment masses using representative values of the <b>dry</b> sediment <b>bulk</b> <b>density.</b> In textbooks, simple relations predicting <b>dry</b> sediment <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> from sediment texture, time since deposition and hydrologic condition are presented. In this study, 13 small flood retention ponds in central Belgium were sampled to reveal the variability in <b>dry</b> sediment <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> and to test the commonly used relations to predict <b>dry</b> sediment <b>bulk</b> <b>density.</b> <b>Dry</b> sediment <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> varies not only between the selected ponds (0. 78 - 1. 35 t m(- 3)) but also within individual ponds (coefficient of variation at 95 per cent ranges from 7 to 80 per cent). The observed variability can be attributed primarily to the hydrologic condition of the retention pond and, also, to sediment texture. The existing relations are not a reliable predictor for the observed <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>densities,</b> because they are primarily based on sediment texture. Thus, when using volumetric sedimentation data from small ponds with varying hydrologic condition to predict sediment yield, existing relations predicting <b>dry</b> sediment <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> cannot be applied. Instead, frequent and dense sampling of sediments is necessary to calculate a representative value of the <b>dry</b> sediment <b>bulk</b> <b>density.</b> Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. status: publishe...|$|R

In the present work, uniaxial confined compression tests were performed on four soils having various textures and different plasticity.

40|$|Accurately {{estimating}} the vertical flux of material reaching the seafloor from the overlying surface waters {{is essential for}} the paleoceanographic reconstruction {{of a wide variety of}} oceanic processes. Two approaches are currently being used. One consists of estimating mass accumulation rates (MAR) between dated horizons as the product of linear sedimentation rates, sediment <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>densities,</b> and concentrations. One pitfall with this approach is that sediments can be redistributed on the seafloor by bottom currents, and their accumulation may not necessarily reflect the true vertical rain rate originating from the overlying water column. To address this problem, the method of ²³⁰Th normalization was developed [Bacon, 1984]. This method is based on the assumption that the rapid scavenging of ²³⁰Th produced in the water column by decay of dissolved uranium results in its flux to the seafloor always being close to its known rate of production. To the extent that this assumption is correct, scavenged ²³⁰Th can be used as a reference to estimate the settling flux of other sedimentary constituents and to correct for sediment redistribution on the seafloor [Henderson and Anderson, 2003; Francois et al., 2004]...|$|R

40|$|Sediment {{dispersal}} at {{the river}} mouths {{has been an important}} topic in the fields of geomorphology and hydraulics {{for a long time and}} estimating sediment budget of the deltas is a principal method for quantifying the sediment dispersal system at many river mouths. Many reports about sediment dispersal at the Yellow River mouth have been given previously using this method. However, since the <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> of deposits in the delta and the boundaries set for calculating the volumes of deposits did not receive a proper treatment, big discrepancy existed between estimates of sediment budgets of the delta provided by the previous studies. Considering the effects of grain size composition, burial depth, and exposure conditions on the <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> of deposits and based on abundant data about the <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> of deposits in the delta, this study defined the dry bulk densities for the deposits in the delta plain and buried delta front deposits, buried prodelta, exposed subaqueous prodelta, and newly deposited top 1 m layers on the delta front. Combining the constructed models of <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> for different depositional settings with the results of analyzing the sedimentary framework of the delta, sediment budgets at Diaokouhe lobe of the Yellow River delta were calculated. The foot of the delta front slope was set as the outer margin of area for defining the sediment budgets. This margin is of geomorphologic significance and is easy to be located on the surface of delta recorded by the bathymetric data. Results show that sediment deposited in the delta plain and front of the Diaokouhe lobe over the period from 1965 to 1974 was about 7. 10 × 10 9 tons, accounting for 73. 5 % of the incoming sediment. Errors resulting from ignoring clay layers in the deposits on delta plain and front, consolidation of soft layers underlying delta deposits, and deviations in records of the incoming sediment were proved to be about 2. 6 % for the percentage of sediment deposited in the delta, suggesting the higher reliability of the sediment budgets given by this study. From the mass and volume of sediments deposited in the Diaokouhe lobe over the period of 1965 - 1974, a mean <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> of 1. 36 g/cm 3 was acquired. On account of the dominance of silt in the deposits of the delta, it seems to be an appropriate approximation of the mean <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>density</b> for the deposits in the other lobes of the delta. 以往在黃河三角洲沉積量的估算中,對沉積物干容重和計算邊界等問題不夠重視,導致計算結果存在明顯出入。本項研究通過廣泛收集資料和大量采樣分析得到了多種沉積環境下沉積物干容重的計算模型,結合三角洲沉積結構分析和利用地形測量數據,計算了黃河口釣口河流路時期亞三角洲不同時期的沉積量。其中 196 5 年至 1974 年間釣口河亞三角洲前緣坡腳以內的總淤積量為 71. 0 億t。其平均干容重為 1. 36 g/cm 3 。這一干容重用于估算其它亞三角洲沉積量不會造成明顯誤差。認為忽略三角洲下松軟沉積層的壓實沉降、三角洲平原相和前緣相中粘性土與非粘性土干容重的差別以及來沙量的測量誤差對計算結果影響較小...|$|E

Models of diffusive transport in com-pacted clays, based only on diffusion in the pore solution, adequately described the diffusion data for all clays and diffusants, and {{there was no need to}} invoke other transport mechanisms, like surface diffusion. The data indicate that surface diffusion is not a significant transport mechanism in compacted clays at least to a clay density of 1. 60 Mg/m 3.

30|$|A soil sample, {{taken at}} 20 -cm depth when {{preparing}} {{the bottom of}} each column, was dried, ground and sieved. Four samples from each site were randomly selected for chemical analysis. Phosphorus, Al, and Fe in the soil samples were extracted with the ammonium lactate method (Egnér et al. 1960) and analyzed with Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) spectrometry (Perkin Elmer, Wellesley, MA) to determine the content of easily available elements (P-AL, Al-AL, and Fe-AL). The concentration of P was analyzed after centrifuging and filtering (0.2 μm) the extracts according to colorimetric methods issued by the International Standard Organization (ISO 15681 – 1 2003) and values were converted to mg kg- 1 soil by using measured <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>densities.</b> The degree of P saturation (DPS-AL) value (%) was calculated as the ratio between P-AL and Fe-AL + Al-AL, expressed on a molar basis (Ulén 2006). The PSI was analyzed according to Börling et al. (2001) using the method of a single addition of 19.4 mmol P kg- 1 soil and being calculated as X/log C, where X is the amount of P sorbed by the soil (in mmol kg- 1 soil) at equilibrium and C is the equilibrium P concentration in the solution (in mmol L- 1).|$|R
40|$|Drought is a {{significant}} disaster in Beijing {{and it is important}} to find a method to assess the drought condition. First, this paper collected data of 85 soil monitoring stations in Beijing, such as soil <b>dry</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>densities,</b> saturated water contents, field capacities. Then, spatial variability characteristics of soil physics parameters were investigated by GIS and other three factors, 10 cm soil moisture content, organic matter and saturated water content which notably influenced soil moisture were extracted by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Furthermore, four different nonlinear methods were put forward to predict crop-root zone soil water. 15555 single daily data from 2011 were used in parameters determination, while 15470 double daily data were used to test. The result showed that the Least Square Support Vector Machine coupling Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (PSO-LSSVM) (R (2) = 0. 875) did better than BP Neural Network (R (2) = 0. 840), Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) (R (2) = 0. 850) and Wavelet Neural Network (WNN) (R (2) = 0. 853). As so the POS-LSSVM method was used to evaluate the drought conditions from October 2010 to March 2011 of Beijing, and the result showed that from October 2010 to January 2011, the drought conditions were getting increasingly worse while later relieved from January 2011 to March 2011...|$|R
