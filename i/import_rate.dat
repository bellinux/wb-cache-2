However, as Keiichi Yano, vice president of iNiS {{and director of the}} game explained in an interview with 1UP.com, selling the game at retail in Western markets would have been unfeasible due to the game's innate reliance on Japanese popular music and cultural references. It was due to this fact that when Yano and iNiS began work on the North American version, the gakuran-wearing cheerleaders of Ouendan were removed and work began on a replacement. The first concepts were of a trio of dancers styled after the Village People; this was changed to a trio of government agents, using distinctly Western references such as the Ghostbusters, Blues Brothers, Men in Black and Austin Powers series for inspiration.

40|$|SummaryThe size of {{the nucleus}} varies among {{different}} cell types, species, and disease states, but mechanisms of nuclear size regulation are poorly understood. We investigated nuclear scaling in the pseudotetraploid frog Xenopus laevis and its smaller diploid relative Xenopus tropicalis, which contains smaller cells and nuclei. Nuclear scaling was recapitulated in vitro using egg extracts, demonstrating that titratable cytoplasmic factors determine nuclear size {{to a greater extent}} than DNA content. Nuclear <b>import</b> <b>rates</b> correlated with nuclear size, and varying the concentrations of two transport factors, importin α and Ntf 2, was sufficient to account for nuclear scaling between the two species. Both factors modulated lamin B 3 import, with importin α increasing overall <b>import</b> <b>rates</b> and Ntf 2 reducing import based on cargo size. Importin α also contributes to nuclear size changes during early X. laevis development. Thus, nuclear transport mechanisms are physiological regulators of both interspecies and developmental nuclear scaling. PaperFlic...|$|R

40|$|AbstractUsing an {{in vivo assay}} system, nuclear import {{ability in}} {{individual}} cells was determined by examining the nuclear <b>import</b> <b>rate.</b> It was found that when a small (not excess) amount of SV 40 T-NLS peptides was co-injected, the nuclear <b>import</b> <b>rate</b> of SV 40 T-NLS-containing substrates apparently increased. This up-regulation was reproduced by the co-injection of peptides containing bipartite type NLS of CBP 80, but not mutated non-functional NLS peptides, which suggests that these phenomena are specific for functional NLSs. It was further shown that although, in growth-arrested cells, the nuclear <b>import</b> <b>rate</b> was down-regulated compared to growing cells, the elevation of the functional <b>import</b> <b>rate</b> by co-injected NLS peptides reached {{the same level as}} in proliferating cells. This up-regulation was abolished by the addition of a protein kinase inhibitor, staurosporine. These results suggest that although potential nuclear import ability does not vary in each cell, the rate of nuclear import may be controlled by the amount of karyophilic proteins, which need to be carried into the nucleus from the cytoplasm, possibly via an NLS-dependent phosphorylation reaction...|$|E

40|$|We {{previously}} reported {{that both the}} nuclear <b>import</b> <b>rate</b> of large karyophilic gold particles and the functional size of the pores are significantly greater in simian virus 40 -transformed fibroblasts (the SV-T 2 cell line) than in nontransformed BALB/c 3 T 3 cells. In this study, we found that cytosolic fractions obtained from SV-T 2 cultures can increase nuclear transport capacity (both <b>import</b> <b>rate</b> and pore size) when microinjected into BALB/c 3 T 3 cells. The transport-enhancing function of the extracts can be abolished by the protein kinase inhibitors staurosporine and K 252 a as well as 5 '-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine and protein phosphatase 2 A, which, although less specific, also interfere with kinase activity. Increases in transport capacity of the same magnitude as that produced by the SV-T 2 extracts were obtained by microinjecting protein kinase A or C or recombinant mitogen-activated protein kinase. These data provide further support for the interpretation that the enhancer is a protein kinase. From experiments performed with specific kinase inhibitor peptides, it appears likely that protein kinase C is the active factor in the SV-T 2 cytosolic fractions; however, this will require further verification. It was also determined, by using gold particles coated with bovine serum albumin conjugated to synthetic nuclear localization signal peptides that lacked phosphorylation sites, that the enhancer affects the transport machinery rather than {{the activity of the}} nuclear localization signals...|$|E
40|$|Mitochondria are {{indispensable}} organelles {{implicated in}} multiple aspects of cellular processes, including tumorigenesis. Heat shock proteins {{play a critical}} regulatory role in accurately delivering the nucleus-encoded proteins through membrane-bound presequence translocase (Tim 23 complex) machinery. Although altered expression of mammalian presequence translocase components had been previously associated with malignant phenotypes, the overall organization of Tim 23 complexes is still unsolved. In this report, we show the existence of three distinct Tim 23 complexes, namely, B 1, B 2, and A, involved in the maintenance of normal mitochondrial function. Our data highlight the importance of Magmas as a regulator of translocase function and in dynamically recruiting the J-proteins DnaJC 19 and DnaJC 15 to individual translocases. The basic housekeeping function involves translocases B 1 and B 2 composed of Tim 17 b isoforms along with DnaJC 19, whereas translocase A is nonessential and has {{a central role in}} oncogenesis. Translocase B, having a normal <b>import</b> <b>rate,</b> is essential for constitutive mitochondrial functions such as maintenance of electron transport chain complex activity, organellar morphology, iron-sulfur cluster protein biogenesis, and mitochondrial DNA.

Measurement of nuclear import kinetics using fluorescently labelled proteins and confocal laser scanning microscopy show that the introduced PK-C site is functional in enhancing T-ag nuclear import compared to a protein lacking the CK 2 site. Treatment with the PK-C activator phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA) further increases the level of maximal nuclear accumulation and the initial nuclear <b>import</b> <b>rate.</b> This engineered PMA-responsive NLS may have application in targeting of molecules {{of interest to the}} nucleus in response to agents stimulating PK-C...|$|E

Short-term changes in partitioning of recently fixed photosynthate between alternative apple fruitlets were followed using in vivo measurement of photosynthate movement. The data indicate that apple fruitlets import photosynthate at a rate matching their utilization capacity, so that increases in availability of photosynthate cause only a small immediate increase in import. Over several hours, further and much larger increases occur, suggesting that an increase in enzymatic activity is induced by the increased availability.

In this study, we found that importin α migrated into the nucleus without the addition of importin β, Ran or any other soluble factors in an in vitro transport assay. A mutant importin α lacking the importin β-binding domain efficiently entered the nucleus. Competition experiments showed that this import pathway for importin α is distinct from that of importin β. These results indicate that importin α alone can enter the nucleus via a novel pathway in an importin β- and Ran-independent manner. Furthermore, this process is evolutionarily conserved as similar results were obtained in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Moreover, the <b>import</b> <b>rate</b> of importin α differed among individual nuclei of permeabilized cells, as demonstrated by time-lapse experiments. This heterogeneous nuclear accumulation of importin α was affected by the addition of ATP, but not ATPγS.

Mechanisms that ensure the proper amplitude and timing of these waves are poorly understood. Using a synthetic gene circuit, we show that a transcriptional activator driven by yeast cell-cycle promoters propagates transcriptional oscillations with substantial damping. Although regulated nuclear translocation has been implicated in the timing of oscillatory events, mathematical analysis shows that increasing the rate of nuclear transport {{is an example of}} a general regulatory principle, which enhances the fidelity of wave propagation. Indeed, increasing the constitutive <b>import</b> <b>rate</b> of the activator counteracts the damping of waves and concurrently preserves the intensity of the signal. In contrast to the regulatory range of nuclear transport, the range of mRNA turnover considerably limits transcriptional wave propagation. This classification of cellular processes outlines potential regulatory mechanisms that can contribute to faithful transmission of oscillations at different stages of the cell cycle...|$|E
40|$|Proteins are {{actively}} unfolded {{to pass through}} narrow channels in macromolecular complexes that catalyze protein translocation and degradation. Catalyzed unfolding shares many features that characterize the mechanical unfolding of proteins using the atomic force microscope (AFM). However, simulations of unfolding induced by the AFM and when a protein is translocated through a pore suggest that each process occurs by distinct pathways. The link, if any, between each type of unfolding, therefore, is not known.
