Services also make up {{a large portion of}} the city's economy, in particular education, healthcare, and finance.

5|$|The game {{features}} {{characters from}} Nintendo video game franchises such as Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Star Fox, and Pokémon. Melee includes all playable characters {{from the first}} game in the series on the Nintendo 64 and also adds new characters from franchises such as Fire Emblem, of which no games had been released outside Japan at the time. The stages and gameplay modes make references to, or take their designs from, popular games released by Nintendo. Melees gameplay system offers an unorthodox approach to the fighting game genre with a counter that measures damage with increasing percentages, rather than a depleting health bar seen in most fighting games. It builds on the first game by adding new gameplay features and playable characters. Following the popularity of its multiplayer gameplay, Melee has been featured in many competitive gaming tournaments, and <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most popular fighting games for competitive play.|$|E
5|$|The theatre {{became part}} of the West End theatre scene and still stages popular musical {{productions}}.

5|$|Though it is {{the least}} {{reactive}} of the halogens, iodine <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the more reactive elements. For example, while chlorine gas will halogenate carbon monoxide, nitrogen monoxide, and sulfur dioxide to phosgene, nitrosyl chloride, and sulfuryl chloride respectively, iodine will not do so. Furthermore, iodination of metals tends to result in lower oxidation states than chlorination or bromination; for example, rhenium metal reacts with chlorine to form rhenium hexachloride, but with bromine it forms only rhenium pentabromide and iodine can achieve only rhenium tetraiodide. By the same token, however, since iodine has the lowest ionisation energy among the halogens and is the most easily oxidised of them, it has a more significant cationic chemistry and its higher oxidation states are rather more stable than those of bromine and chlorine, for example in iodine heptafluoride.|$|E

5|$|Puerto Rico's {{avifauna}} {{has diminished}} due to extinction and extirpation, either by natural forces or human intervention. For example, fossil evidence was discovered for {{a species of}} swift, Tachornis uranoceles, dated to the late Pleistocene (between 17,000 and 21,000 years ago). The species {{is believed to have}} become extinct as a result of habitat alteration after the Wisconsin glaciation. At least six endemic species have become extinct in the last millennia: Puerto Rican barn owl (Tyto cavatica), Puerto Rican caracara (Polyborus latebrosus), Puerto Rican conure (Aratinga chloroptera maugei), Puerto Rican woodcock (Scolopax anthonyi), Puerto Rican quail-dove (Geotrygon larva), and the Antillean cave rail (Nesotrochis debooyi). With a population of 13 individuals in 1975, the Puerto Rican parrot almost became the seventh, but conservation efforts helped save the species from extinction. However, it <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the ten most critically endangered birds in the world. Four Puerto Rican birds, the Hispaniolan parakeet, the white-necked crow, the Cuban crow, and the limpkin, became extirpated after Puerto Rico's population expansion {{in the latter half of}} the nineteenth century and three more species, the black-bellied whistling duck, the black rail, and the American flamingo, no longer breed in the archipelago.|$|E
