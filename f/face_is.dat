40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that own-race <b>faces</b> <b>are</b> more {{accurately}} recognised than other-race faces. The present study {{examined the effects of}} own- and other-race face recognition when different ethnicity targets are presented to the participants together. Also the effect of semantic information on the recognition of different race <b>faces</b> <b>was</b> examined. The participants (N = 234) were presented with photos of own-race and other-race faces. For some participants the <b>faces</b> <b>were</b> presented with stereotypical names and for some not. As hypothesized, own-race <b>faces</b> <b>were</b> better recognised in target-present lineup and more correctly rejected in target-absent lineup than other-race faces. Concerning presentation method, both own-race and other-race <b>faces</b> <b>were</b> more correctly identified in target-present simultaneous than in target-present sequential lineups. No effects of stereotypical names on <b>face</b> recognition <b>were</b> found. The findings suggest that identifying multi-ethnicity perpetrators is a problematic and difficult task...|$|R

5|$|The {{cause of}} trigeminal neuralgia, {{in which one}} side of the <b>face</b> <b>is</b> exquisitely painful, is thought to be {{compression}} of the nerve by an artery as the nerve emerges from the brain stem. An acoustic neuroma, particularly at the junction between the pons and medulla, may compress the facial nerve (VII) and vestibulocochlear nerve (VIII), leading to hearing and sensory loss on the affected side.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWhen {{complementary}} {{halves of}} different familiar <b>faces</b> <b>are</b> combined {{into a new}} <b>face,</b> there <b>is</b> interference {{in the identification of}} either half. This “composite <b>face</b> effect” has <b>been</b> taken as strong evidence that <b>faces</b> <b>are</b> processed holistically. Here, we demonstrate that this effect can persist when the two parts of a <b>face</b> <b>are</b> separated by up to 80 ms of visual noise, showing that the parts of a face interact not only spatially but also temporally. We suggest that the processing underlying robust identification accepts an accumulation of evidence over time...|$|R
40|$|Memory for in-group <b>faces</b> {{tends to}} <b>be</b> better than memory for out-group faces. Ackerman et al. (Psychological Science 17 : 836 – 840, 2006) {{found that this}} effect reverses when male faces display anger, {{supposedly}} due to their functional value in signaling intergroup threat. We explored the generalizability of this reverse effect. White participants viewed Black and White male or female faces displaying angry, fearful, or neutral expressions. Recognition accuracy for White male <b>faces</b> <b>was</b> better than for Black male <b>faces</b> when <b>faces</b> <b>were</b> neutral, but this reversed when the faces displayed anger or fear. For female targets, Black <b>faces</b> <b>were</b> generally better recognized than White faces, and female <b>faces</b> <b>were</b> better remembered when they displayed anger rather than fear, whereas male <b>faces</b> <b>were</b> better remembered when they displayed fear rather than anger. These findings are difficult to reconcile with a functional account and suggest (a) that the processing of male out-group <b>faces</b> <b>is</b> influenced by negative emotional expressions in general; and (b) that gender role expectations lead to differential remembering {{of male and female}} faces as a function of emotional expressio...|$|R
50|$|The west <b>face</b> <b>was</b> first {{climbed in}} 1879 by G. A. Passingham with guides F. Imseng and L. Zurbrücken. Other routes on the <b>face</b> <b>were</b> opened in 1883 and 1889.

The ambience {{is shown in the}} form of wishing trees, fountains of the water of life, rain bows in five colors with cloud formations and light emanating from lotus flowers. The palace is also shown with a throne with eight corners fully and curiously bejewelled. Padmasmbahva is shown sitting on a pure stalk of lotus emitting divine energy appearing “divine, charitable, powerful, or fierce”.|$|E

5|$|During post-production, as the {{producers}} {{decided to change}} the film into a more serious horror film, they filmed numerous scenes for that purpose without {{the participation of the}} director.

Additionally, the film was extensively re-edited by {{the producers}}. Sachs criticized the acting in those re-shot scenes, as well as the change of tone they bring into the film along with the re-editing by the producers.|$|E
5|$|During the Middle Ages, clocks {{primarily}} served religious purposes; {{the first}} employed for secular timekeeping emerged around the 15th century. In Dublin, the official measurement of time became a local custom, and by 1466 a public clock stood {{on top of}} the Tholsel (the city court and council chamber). It was {{the first of its kind}} to be clearly recorded in Ireland, and would only have had an hour hand. The increasing lavishness of castles led to the introduction of turret clocks. A 1435 example survives from Leeds castle; its <b>face</b> <b>is</b> decorated with the images of the Crucifixion of Jesus, Mary and St George.|$|E
5|$|Highly distinctive, male lions {{are easily}} {{recognized}} by their manes, and the male's <b>face</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the}} most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture. Depictions have existed from the Upper Paleolithic period, with carvings and paintings from the Lascaux and Chauvet Caves in France dated to 17,000 years ago, through virtually all ancient and medieval cultures where they once occurred. It has been extensively depicted in sculptures, in paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. Lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire, and have been a key species sought for exhibition in zoos over the world since the late eighteenth century. Zoos are cooperating worldwide in breeding programs for the endangered Asiatic lions.|$|E
40|$|Happy <b>faces</b> <b>are</b> {{categorized}} faster as “happy” than angry {{faces as}} “angry,” the happy face advantage. Here, we show across three experiments {{that the size}} of the happy face advantage for male Caucasian faces varies {{as a function of the}} other <b>faces</b> they <b>are</b> presented with. A happy <b>face</b> advantage <b>was</b> present if the male Caucasian <b>faces</b> <b>were</b> presented among male African American faces, but absent if the same <b>faces</b> <b>were</b> presented among female faces, Caucasian or African American. The modulation of the happy face advantage for male Caucasian <b>faces</b> <b>was</b> observed even if the female Caucasian/male African American faces had neutral expressions. This difference in the happy face advantage for a constant set of faces as a function of the other faces presented indicates that it does not reflect on a stimulus-dependent bottom-up process but on the evaluation of the expressive faces within a specific context...|$|R

40|$|It is {{commonly}} assumed that happy <b>face</b> should <b>be</b> preferred over sad face, and yet tragic dramas and sad songs are popular and seem better memorized. Related {{studies showed that}} sad <b>faces</b> <b>are</b> perceived as more familiar than happy faces (Sergerie et al., 2007), and familiar <b>faces</b> <b>are</b> preferred over novel ones (Park et al., 2010; Liao et al., 2011). Connecting these two lines of studies {{would lead to a}} paradoxical conclusion that people should prefer seemingly familiar faces, namely, sad faces. We examine this by pairing an emotional face (happy or sad) with a neutral face of the same identity. All <b>faces</b> <b>were</b> new and viewed only once for each participant. The task was to rate relative preference and familiarity on the paired faces. Results showed that happy <b>faces</b> <b>were</b> preferred over neutral faces whereas sad <b>faces</b> <b>were</b> less preferred, providing empirical support for the common belief. However, while happy faces did not show any bias on familiarity judgment, sad <b>faces</b> <b>were</b> perceived as less familiar than neutral faces, inconsistent with Sergerie et al. (2007). That less favorable sad faces also appear less familiar suggests close relationship between familiarity and preference for sad faces but not for happy ones...|$|R

In the primary form, his <b>face</b> <b>is</b> blue and splotched with blood. Red rays radiate from his bloodshot eyes. Blood pours from his {{nostrils}} and smoke billows from his ears. His mouth is filled with decomposing human flesh and his breath is foul. His entire body is coloured scarlet with dripping blood. He is closely associated with Mara, the demon king of death.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{published}} illustrations, {{which may have}} been drawn by Raspe himself, the Baron appears slim and youthful. For the 1792 Sequel to the Adventures of Baron Munchausen, an anonymous artist drew the Baron as a dignified but tired old soldier whose <b>face</b> <b>is</b> marred by injuries from his adventures; this illustration remained the standard portrait of the Baron for about seventy years, and its imagery was echoed in Cruikshank's depictions of the character. Doré, illustrating a Théophile Gautier fils translation in 1862, retained the sharply beaked nose and twirled moustache from the 1792 portrait, but gave the Baron a healthier and more affable appearance; the Doré Baron became the definitive visual representation for the character.|$|E

50|$|Research {{indicates}} that facial symmetry {{is linked to}} the 'big-five' model of personality. The most consistent finding is that facial symmetry is positively correlated with extraversion, indicating that individuals with more symmetric <b>faces</b> <b>are</b> also more extroverted.

More symmetrical <b>faces</b> <b>are</b> also more likely to have more desirable social attributes assigned to them, such as sociable, intelligent or lively.|$|R
