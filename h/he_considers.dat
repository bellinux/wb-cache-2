50|$|Steiner contrasted the anthroposophical {{approach}} with both conventional mysticism, which <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> lacking the clarity necessary for exact knowledge, and natural science, which <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> arbitrarily limited to investigating the outer world.|$|R
2500|$|Sapir {{introduced}} {{a number of}} other distinctions according to which languages could be morphologically classified, and proposed combining them to form more complex classifications. He proposed classifying languages both by the degree of synthesis, classifying languages as either analytic, synthetic or polysynthetic, and by the technique used to achieve synthesis, classifying languages as agglutinative, fusional, or symbolic. Among the examples of polysynthetic languages he gave was Haida which <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> to use the agglutinative-isolating technique, Yana and Nootka both of which <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> agglutinative, Chinook and Algonkin which <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> fusional. The Siouan languages <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> [...] "mildly polysynthetic" [...] and agglutinative-fusional.|$|R
50|$|Ibn Taymiya — <b>He</b> <b>considered</b> Shiites more heretical than Jews, Christians {{and many}} polytheists. Noting {{contemporary}} circumstances, <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> Shiites more {{harmful to the}} Muslim community than {{groups such as the}} Crusaders and Mongols.|$|R
5|$|Following the {{retirement}} of John Paul Stevens in June 2010, the Court had an entirely non-Protestant composition {{for the first time}} in its history. Although Neil Gorsuch, appointed in 2017, attends an Episcopalian church, he was raised Catholic and it is unclear if <b>he</b> <b>considers</b> himself a Catholic or a Protestant.|$|E
5|$|Parker {{has said}} that <b>he</b> <b>considers</b> himself a Christian, and that {{he grew up in}} the church. According to a DNA analysis, some of Parker's ancestry is from the Tikar people of modern-day Cameroon.|$|E
5|$|Taylor {{considers}} 4...Nxe5 inferior, recommending {{instead a}} rarely played idea of Richard Réti, 4...h5! (Taylor's exclamation point). Then 5.Nf3 would allow 5...Bc5, while Taylor suggests meeting 5.Be2 with 5...Nc6! and 5.f4 with 5...Bc5 with quick development compensating {{for the lost}} pawn. <b>He</b> <b>considers</b> the main line to be 4...h5 5.h3 Nxe5 6.Be3 Bb4+, with good play for Black.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>considered</b> {{this last}} an excruciating joke, and {{permitted}} {{himself to be}} convulsed with laughter for half a minute. Part of his mirth was assumed, but <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> it his humane duty to cheer up the Chinago.|$|R
60|$|Sam Dickson gave a snort. It {{was very}} good of the boy, but <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> it his duty to snub him, in order to {{counteract}} what <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> to be the pernicious counsels and treatment of his wife.|$|R
60|$|Carrie {{understood}} {{that this was}} probably as far as <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> it advisable to venture, since she knew that <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> her husband a stock-rider too. Although she was not exactly pleased, {{it did not seem}} worth while to show her displeasure.|$|R
5|$|Teeuw {{writes that}} the {{literary}} style is didactic, which <b>he</b> <b>considers</b> the novel's main shortcoming. However, he notes that Mihardja {{was part of a}} literary movement led by Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana that viewed literature as being instructive; he also writes that such a style was common in Indonesian literature at the time.|$|E
5|$|Teeuw {{wrote that}} the moral {{messages}} and sentimentality in Sitti Nurbaya are overdone, similar to Azab dan Sengsara. However, <b>he</b> <b>considers</b> the plot of Sitti Nurbaya more interesting for a reader from a Western background than the older novel.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} encourages Siva's {{friends to}} ask him to stand for the student-union presidency, but he wants them to nominate Naresh (one of the group) instead. Ganesh's attempts to pacify Siva fail, and Bhavani learns about him. <b>He</b> <b>considers</b> Siva a potential replacement for J. D., whose weakness annoys him.|$|E

5|$|Wallace {{describes}} {{the island of}} Timor, its abundance of fan-palms, its people who are like Papuans, and the Portuguese government which <b>he</b> <b>considers</b> extremely poor. On some hills he finds Eucalyptus (gum) trees, a genus from Australia; he finds the vegetation monotonous also.|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{to import}} workers from Myanmar and Bangladesh have failed. Indonesian {{president}} Joko Widodo has reportedly said that <b>he</b> <b>considers</b> {{the export of}} domestic labour a national embarrassment, pledging that his government will end the practice. In February 2015 there were 331,989 foreign domestic workers in Hong Kong, of which 166,743 were from the Philippines – an increase of 7,000 from the previous year, {{with the number of}} Indonesians remaining static.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{circumstances}} of the separation, Holopainen's appreciation of Turunen as an artist remained. He explained that he did not search for a similarly trained singer as a successor for Turunen because <b>he</b> <b>considers</b> her to be extraordinarily good in her genre and therefore irreplaceable. Turunen {{said in an interview that}} she is very proud of her career with Nightwish. She considers the remaining band members extremely talented and wishes all the best for them and their subsequent lead singer Anette Olzon.|$|E

5000|$|Hennessey {{focused his}} product line on roses <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> {{to be proven}} performers, rather than the newest introductions. [...] He could be harshly {{critical}} of new introductions <b>he</b> <b>considered</b> to not be improvements on roses already on the market. His catalogs contained specific cultivation advice for many of his offerings.|$|R

5|$|<b>He</b> <b>considers</b> {{the forces}} such as surface tension acting on cells, and Plateau's {{experiments}} on soap films. He illustrates {{the way a}} splash breaks into droplets and compares this to the shapes of Campanularian zoophytes (Hydrozoa). He looks at the flask-like shapes of single-celled organisms such as species of Vorticella, considering teleological and physical explanations of their having minimal areas; and at the hanging drop shapes of some Foraminifera such as Lagena. He argues that the cells of trypanosomes are similarly shaped by surface tension.|$|E
5|$|Hosseini has {{commented that}} <b>he</b> <b>considers</b> The Kite Runner to be a father–son story, {{emphasizing}} the familial {{aspects of the}} narrative, an element that he continued to use in his later works. Themes of guilt and redemption feature prominently in the novel, with a pivotal scene depicting an act of violence against Hassan that Amir fails to prevent. The {{latter half of the}} book centers on Amir's attempts to atone for this transgression by rescuing Hassan's son over two decades later.|$|E
5|$|In May 2009, President Barack Obama {{nominated}} a Catholic woman, Sonia Sotomayor, {{to replace}} retiring Justice David Souter. Her confirmation raised {{the number of}} Catholics on the Court to six, compared to three non-Catholics (all Jewish). With Antonin Scalia's death in February 2016, the number of Catholic Justices went back to five. Neil Gorsuch, appointed in 2017, was raised Catholic but attends an Episcopalian church; it is unclear if <b>he</b> <b>considers</b> himself a Catholic or a Protestant.|$|E

5|$|In these stanzas, Donne {{compares the}} parting of two lovers to a death, {{desiring}} the lovers' parting to be quiet, without struggle, and voluntary {{even though it}} is inevitable. At the same time, <b>he</b> <b>considers</b> the separation of lovers to be equivalent to the soul separating from the body on death. Ramie Targoff argues that this is not because he sees the separation of the lovers as permanent, like death, but that as with death Donne finds the challenge with separation to be ensuring the relationship's continuity in the future.|$|E
5|$|Muhammad Darwis (Ihsan Tarore) is a {{youth in}} 19th-century Kauman, Yogyakarta, {{and the son}} of Kyai Abubakar, the imam of the area's mosque. Displeased with the mixture of Islam and animistic Javanese mysticism, which leads to poor Javanese {{spending}} exorbitant amounts of money on religious ceremonies, Darwis decides to go on the hajj to Mecca in Saudi Arabia. While there, he studies what <b>he</b> <b>considers</b> the true form of Islam over a period of five years.|$|E
5|$|The Indonesian {{literary}} scholar Ajip Rosidi {{writes that}} the vast majority of the stories in Kawan Bergeloet are meant as comedy. <b>He</b> <b>considers</b> only one story—"Piloe"—to have been intended as more serious or sad. Several of the stories use tropes previously seen in Kasim's Teman Doedoek, such as conflict arising from a misunderstanding, and the contents of some other stories are similar.|$|E
