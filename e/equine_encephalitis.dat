5|$|Among large North American carnivores, {{the coyote}} {{probably}} carries {{the largest number}} of diseases and parasites, likely due to its wide range and varied diet. Viral diseases known to infect coyotes include rabies, canine distemper, infectious canine hepatitis, four strains of <b>equine</b> <b>encephalitis,</b> and oral papillomatosis. By the late 1970s, serious rabies outbreaks in coyotes had ceased to be a problem for over 60 years, though sporadic cases every 1–5 years did occur. Distemper causes the deaths of many pups in the wild, though some specimens can survive infection. Tularemia, a bacterial disease, infects coyotes through their rodent and lagomorph prey, and can be deadly for pups.|$|E
5|$|The National Park Service (NPS) {{acquired}} {{the island in}} 1972 and declared it the Cumberland Island National Seashore. Since then, few new horses have been introduced to the island, though four Arabians were introduced in the early 1990s {{in the hopes of}} diversifying and bettering the existing population. Since 1981, the NPS has been monitoring the horses and tracking their impact on the environment. In 1991, an outbreak of eastern <b>equine</b> <b>encephalitis</b> killed about 40 horses, or approximately 18% of the herd. The population on Cumberland Island is one of seven feral horse herds on US barrier islands.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduced}} snake Boa constrictor preys on O.couesi on Cozumel. Parasites {{recorded on}} O.couesi in Veracruz include unidentified ticks, mites, fleas, and fly larvae. The flea Polygenis odiosus {{was found on}} an Oryzomys couesi from Cozumel. Out of ten O.couesi in San Luis Potosí, five each were infected by the nematode worms Hassalstrongylus musculi and H.bocqueti, with about 25 worms per rat, and two were infected by one or two cestodes of the genus Raillietina. The mites Eubrachylaelaps circularis and Gigantolaelaps boneti have been found on Oryzomys couesi in Oaxaca, the sucking louse Hoplopleura oryzomydis in Nicaragua, the mites Laelaps oryzomydis, Echinonyssus microchelae, Ornithonyssus bacoti, Prolistrophorus frontalis, and Prolistrophorus bakeri in Colima, and the apicomplexan Eimeria couesii in Mexico. The species is infected by two hantaviruses—Catacamas virus in Honduras and Playa de Oro virus in western Mexico—which {{are related to the}} Bayou virus infecting the marsh rice rat, a common cause of hantavirus infections in the United States. No hantavirus infections in humans have been linked to O.couesi hantaviruses, however. Chiapas O.couesi easily survive experimental infection with several arboviruses, including the Venezuelan <b>equine</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus, suggesting that the species may serve as a reservoir for that virus.|$|E

The 50 % effective dose for each compound alone or {{in a series of}} combinations was determined with a plaque reduction assay. Combinations of ribavirin and selenazofurin were synergistic against Venezuelan <b>equine</b> encephalomyelitis, Japanese <b>encephalitis,</b> yellow fever, and Pichinde viruses, with fractional inhibitory concentrations of 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 4, respectively, but showed additive effects against Korean hemorrhagic fever and Rift Valley fever viruses. Combinations of ribavirin and tiazofurin were synergistic against yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis (fractional inhibitory concentrations, 0. 41 and 0. 48, respectively) but showed additive effects against Korean hemorrhagic fever virus. Combinations of selenazofurin and tiazofurin had additive effects against Japanese encephalitis, yellow fever, and Korean hemorrhagic fever viruses.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the partial effects of vaccination against <b>equine</b> Japanese <b>encephalitis</b> (JE) and characterize other prognostic factors {{based on previous}} outbreak records in Japan from 1953 to 1960. Methods: Individual case records, which included demographic information, vaccination history, and clinical information (dates of onset, recovery and death, and symptoms), were investigated. The relations between two outcomes, JE death and symptomatic period, and other variables were examined. Results: Of a total reported 803 cases during the observation period, 453 (56. 5 %) were diagnosed with either serological, histopathological, or epizootiological methods. Vaccination (adjusted odds ratio = 0. 77, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 61, 0. 97) and an older age (adjusted odds ratio = 0. 83, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 71, 0. 96) significantly reduced the risk of JE death. The symptomatic period was also significantly shortened with vaccination (p < 0. 001). Conclusions: The risk of JE death was lowered and the symptomatic period of survivors shortened with inactivated JE vaccination. These findings demonstrate the partial effects of vaccination in reducing the burden of this disease. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Mosquito blood meals provide {{information}} about the feeding habits and host preference of potential arthropod-borne disease vectors. Although mosquito-borne diseases are ubiquitous in the Neotropics, few studies in this region have assessed patterns of mosquito-host interactions, especially during actual disease outbreaks. Based on collections made during and after an outbreak of <b>equine</b> viral <b>encephalitis,</b> we identified the source of 338 blood meals from 10 species of mosquitoes from Aruza Abajo, a location in Darien province in eastern Panama. A PCR based method targeting three distinct mitochondrial targets and subsequent DNA sequencing was used {{in an effort to}} delineate vector-host relationships. At Aruza Abajo, large domesticated mammals dominated the assemblage of mosquito blood meals while wild bird and mammal species represented {{only a small portion of}} the blood meal pool. Most mosquito species fed on a variety of hosts; foraging index analysis indicates that eight of nine mosquito species utilize hosts at similar proportions while a stochastic model suggests dietary overlap among species was greater than would be expected by chance. The results from our null-model analysis of mosquito diet overlap are consistent with the hypothesis that in landscapes where large domestic animals dominate the local biomass, many mosquito species show little host specificity, and feed upon hosts in proportion to their biomass, which may have implications for the role of livestocking patterns in vector-borne disease ecology...|$|R
40|$|In 2000, ArboNET, an {{enhanced}} {{human and animal}} surveillance system designed to monitor the geographic spread of West Nile virus (WNV) in the United States and to identify areas {{at increased risk for}} human infections with WNV, detected WNV activity in the District of Columbia and 12 states (1). This system, first implemented in the District of Columbia and 20 states along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, was later expanded throughout the continental United States. This report summarizes ArboNET data from January 1 through July 25, 2001, which documents epizootic WNV activity in the southeast and indicates the need for widespread implementation of WNV prevention activities.

40|$|Abstract. We {{examined}} whether live attenuated Japanese encephalitis (JE) {{vaccine is}} effective in preventing West Nile virus (WNV) infection in the People’s Republic of China. Three groups were recruited into the study: patients with Japanese encephalitis (JE), healthy controls vaccinated with live attenuated 2 SA 14 - 14 -vaccine against JE virus (JEV), and unvaccinated healthy controls. Serum samples were collected and screened for IgG antibodies against JEV by an indirect immunofluorescence assay. Positive samples were then analyzed for levels of antibodies against JEV and neutralizing antibodies against West Nile virus (WNV) by a plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Although most persons had medium {{to high levels of}} JEV-reactive IgG and neutralizing antibodies, only 2 of the 82 unvaccinated control samples were positive for the WNV-reactive antibodies. These findings suggest that previous JEV infection or vaccination did not induce adequate levels of WNV-reactive antibodies in the population studied. However, how these persons would respond to a secondary flavivirus infection and whether their prior experience with wild-type or attenu-ated JE vaccine will provide some cross-protection against WNV disease still warrants further investigation. The appearance of West Nile virus (WNV) in North America, which resulted in human and <b>equine</b> cases of <b>encephalitis,</b> brought worldwide attention to this serious public health is-sue.

40|$|The {{isolation}} of arboviruses from patient's low titer sera can be difficult. Here {{we compared the}} detection efficiency of Dengue (DEN), Yellow Fever (YF), Saint Louis Encephalitis (SLE), West Nile (WN), Ilheus (ILH), Group C (GC), Oropouche (ORO), Mayaro (MAY) and Venezuela <b>Encephalitis</b> <b>Equine</b> (VEE) viruses using a Modified Shell Vial Culture (MSVC) protocol to a Standard Cell Culture (SCC) protocol. First the MSVC and SCC protocols were compared using five dilutions {{for each of the}} following stock viruses: DEN- 1, DEN- 2, DEN- 3, DEN- 4, YF, SLE, WN, ILH, GC, ORO, MAY and VEE. Next, patients' original sera from which viruses (DEN- 1, DEN- 2, DEN- 3, YF, GC, ORO, MAY and VEE) had been previously isolated were compare by the two methods using five sera dilutions. In addition, seven sera that were positive for DEN- 3 by RT-PCR and negative by SCC were processed by MSVC. The MSVC protocol was consistently 1 - 2 logs higher virus dilution more sensitive for virus detection than the SCC protocol for all stock Flaviviruses tested (DEN- 1, DEN- 2, DEN- 3, DEN- 4, YF, SLE, WN and ILH). MSVC was equal to or one log more sensitive for virus detection than SCC for the stock Bunyaviruses (GC and ORO). For the stock Alphavirus MAY, MSVC was equally or one log more sensitive for virus detection than SCC, while for VEE SCC was equally or one log more sensitive for virus detection than MSVC. MSVC was consistently one to two sera dilutions more sensitive than SCC for the detection of Flaviviruses from patients' sera. Both methods were approximately equally sensitive for the detection of Bunyaviruses from patients' sera and equal or one dilution less sensitive for the detection of Alphaviruses from patients' sera.

25|$|There {{are many}} alphaviruses {{distributed}} {{around the world}} with the ability to cause human disease. Infectious arthritis, encephalitis, rashes and fever are the most commonly observed symptoms. Larger mammals such as humans and horses are usually dead-end hosts or play a minor role in viral transmission; however, in the case of Venezuelan <b>equine</b> <b>encephalitis</b> the virus is mainly amplified in horses. In most other cases the virus is maintained in nature in mosquitoes, rodents and birds.|$|E
25|$|Many, if not all, blood-sucking {{species of}} {{mosquitoes}} are fairly selective feeders that specialise in particular host species, though they often relax their selectivity when they experience severe competition for food, defensive {{activity on the}} part of the hosts, or starvation. Some species feed selectively on monkeys, while others prefer particular kinds of birds, but they become less selective as conditions become more difficult. For example, Culiseta melanura sucks the blood of passerine birds for preference and such birds are typically the main reservoir of the Eastern <b>equine</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus in North America. Early in the season while mosquito numbers are low, they concentrate on passerine hosts, but as mosquito numbers rise and the birds are forced to defend themselves more vigorously, the mosquitoes become less selective in attacking their avian hosts. Soon the mosquitoes begin attacking mammals more readily, thereby becoming the major vector of the virus, and causing epidemics of the disease, most conspicuously in humans and horses.|$|E
25|$|In 1948, a top-secret Soviet bioweapons {{laboratory}} {{was established}} on the island, {{in the center}} of the Aral Sea which is now disputed territory between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. The exact history, functions and current status of this facility are still unclear, but bio-agents tested there included Bacillus anthracis, Coxiella burnetii, Francisella tularensis, Brucella suis, Rickettsia prowazekii, Variola major (smallpox), Yersinia pestis, botulinum toxin, and Venezuelan <b>equine</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus. In 1971, weaponized smallpox from the island reached a nearby ship, which then allowed the virus to spread to the city of Aral. Ten people there were infected, of whom 3 died, and a massive vaccination effort involving 50,000 inhabitants ensued (see Aral smallpox incident). The bioweapons base was abandoned in 1992 following the disintegration of the Soviet Union the previous year. Scientific expeditions proved this had been a site for production, testing and later dumping of pathogenic weapons. In 2002, through a project organized by the United States and with Uzbekistan's assistance, 10 anthrax burial sites were decontaminated. According to the Kazakh Scientific Center for Quarantine and Zoonotic Infections, all burial sites of anthrax were decontaminated.|$|E

2500|$|Alphaviruses are of {{interest}} to gene therapy researchers, in particular the Ross River virus, Sindbis virus, Semliki Forest virus, and Venezuelan <b>equine</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus have all been used to develop viral vectors for gene delivery. Of particular interest are the chimeric viruses that may be formed with alphaviral envelopes and retroviral capsids. Such chimeras are termed pseudotyped viruses. [...] Alphaviral envelope pseudotypes of retroviruses or lentiviruses are able to integrate the genes that they carry into the expansive range of potential host cells that are recognized and infected by the alphaviral envelope proteins E2 and E1. The stable integration of viral genes is mediated by the retroviral interiors of these vectors. There are limitations {{to the use of}} alphaviruses in the field of gene therapy due to their lack of targeting, however, through the introduction of variable antibody domains in a non-conserved loop in the structure of E2, specific populations of cells have been targeted. Furthermore, the use of whole alphaviruses for gene therapy is of limited efficacy both because several internal alphaviral proteins are involved in the induction of apoptosis upon infection and also because the alphaviral capsid mediates only the transient introduction of mRNA into host cells. Neither of these limitations extend to alphaviral envelope pseudotypes of retroviruses or lentiviruses. However, the expression of Sindbis virus envelopes may lead to apoptosis, and their introduction into host cells upon infection by Sindbis virus envelope pseudotyped retroviruses may also lead to cell death. [...] The toxicity of Sindbis viral envelopes may be the cause of the very low production titers realized from packaging cells constructed to produce Sindbis pseudotypes. Another branch of research involving alphaviruses is in vaccination. Alphaviruses are apt to be engineered to create replicon vectors which efficiently induce humoral and T-cell immune responses. They could therefore be used to vaccinate against viral, bacterial, protozoan, and tumor antigens.|$|E
