5|$|After the {{discovery}} of Vesta, no further objects were discovered for 38 years, and the Solar System was thought to have eleven planets. However, in 1845, new asteroids started being discovered at a rapid pace, and by 1851 there were fifteen, {{each with its own}} symbol, in addition to the eight major planets (Neptune had been discovered in 1846). It soon became clear that it would be impractical to continue inventing new planetary symbols indefinitely, and some of the existing ones proved difficult to draw quickly. That year, the problem was addressed by Benjamin Apthorp Gould, who suggested numbering asteroids in their order of discovery, and placing this number in a disk (circle) as the <b>generic</b> <b>symbol</b> of an asteroid. Thus, the fourth asteroid, Vesta, acquired the <b>generic</b> <b>symbol</b> ④. This was soon coupled with the name into an official number–name designation, ④ Vesta, as the number of minor planets increased. By 1858, the circle had been simplified to parentheses, (4) Vesta, which were easier to typeset. Other punctuation, such as 4) Vesta and 4, Vesta, was also used, but had more or less completely died out by 1949. Today, either Vesta, or, more commonly, 4 Vesta, is used.|$|E
25|$|As {{an example}} of the {{transfer}} principle, the statement that for any nonzero number x, 2xnbsp&≠nbsp&x, is true for the real numbers, and it is in the form required by the transfer principle, so it is also true for the hyperreal numbers. This shows that {{it is not possible to}} use a <b>generic</b> <b>symbol</b> such as ∞ for all the infinite quantities in the hyperreal system; infinite quantities differ in magnitude from other infinite quantities, and infinitesimals from other infinitesimals.|$|E
25|$|In 1851, {{after the}} fifteenth {{asteroid}} (Eunomia) had been discovered, Johann Franz Encke {{made a major}} change in the upcoming 1854 edition of the Berliner Astronomisches Jahrbuch (BAJ, Berlin Astronomical Yearbook). He introduced a disk (circle), a traditional symbol for a star, as the <b>generic</b> <b>symbol</b> for an asteroid. The circle was then numbered in order of discovery to indicate a specific asteroid (although he assigned ① to the fifth, Astraea, while continuing to designate the first four only with their existing iconic symbols). The numbered-circle convention was quickly adopted by astronomers, and the next asteroid to be discovered (16 Psyche, in 1852) was the first to be designated in that way {{at the time of its}} discovery. However, Psyche was given an iconic symbol as well, as were a few other asteroids discovered over the next few years (see chart above). 20 Massalia was the first asteroid that was not assigned an iconic symbol, and no iconic symbols were created after the 1855 discovery of 37 Fides. That year Astraea's number was increased to ⑤, but the first four asteroids, Ceres to Vesta, were not listed by their numbers until the 1867 edition. The circle was soon abbreviated to a pair of parentheses, which were easier to typeset and sometimes omitted altogether over the next few decades, leading to the modern convention.|$|E

On a second type of coin, there is an [...] "X" [...] sign on the reverse side; these may originate from the mint of a local ruler. There is a suggestion that the coins of the second type were minted by rulers of the Turkic state of Kangu Tarban, the population of which were the Kangars. According to the coins, in the 6th to 8th centuries, Kangu Tarban was ruled by a local dynasty of the Kangars, and their capital became a Tarban town named Turarband that was later to be called Otrar. Since the times of the golden hordes, the ruins of Otrar have been attractive because of rumours about the treasures of the ancient rulers, and about buried piles of gold coins and jewelry. The source of such legends was perhaps confirmed by the archaeological finds of various coins and jewelry.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{the last}} decade speech {{processing}} has been applied in commercially available products. One of the key reasons for its success is the identification and use of an underlying set of <b>generic</b> <b>symbols</b> (phonemes) constituting all speech. In this work we follow the same approach, but for the problem of human body gestures. That is, the topic {{of this paper is}} how to define a framework for automatically finding primitives for human body gestures. This is done by considering a gesture as a trajectory and then searching for points where the density of the training data is high. The trajectories are re-sampled to enable a direct comparison between the samples of each trajectory, and enable time invariant comparisons. This work demonstrates and tests the primitive’s ability to reconstruct sampled trajectories. Promising test results are shown for samples from different test persons performing gestures from a small one armed gesture set. ...|$|R

Stevens finds meaning without applying <b>generic</b> <b>symbols</b> like a formula, instead relying on human emotion and an appeal to the senses to create new meanings.
