5|$|Howard {{was born}} in Long Branch, Ontario in 1926, the younger of two children. Her father, Thomas Howard, a {{secondary}} school teacher, was an English immigrant. Her mother, Helen Mackintosh, who {{was born in}} Winnipeg, was of Scottish ancestry. Having decided early to become an artist, Howard studied at the Ontario College of Art in Toronto from 1948 to 1951, where she was a pupil of Will Ogilvie, who taught her figure drawing, and Jock Macdonald, who taught <b>her</b> <b>painting</b> and composition.

5|$|Within {{and beyond}} her artistic works, Bancroft has {{demonstrated}} concern {{for a range}} of social issues, particularly those affecting Indigenous Australians. <b>Her</b> <b>painting</b> Prevention of AIDS (1992) was reproduced on posters and postcards aimed at raising awareness of HIV/AIDS, and was one of several of her images commissioned by the federal Department of Health to highlight issues regarding the disease in the Indigenous community. In 2000, two years after the death of activist Mum (Shirl) Smith, Bancroft and the Boomalli Aboriginal Artists Co-operative organised a fund-raising exhibition of art works in Smith's honour.|$|E
5|$|In 1990 Linda Syddick went to Sydney to see {{her work}} Ngkarte Dreaming hung in the Blake Prize {{exhibition}} – one of three occasions prior to 1994 on which she was a Blake finalist. The Adelaide Biennial of Australian Art included one of her paintings in 1998. She has been represented on several occasions in the National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Awards, in 1995, 2006 (with <b>her</b> <b>painting</b> The Witch Doctor and the Windmill), 2008 (with Big rain at Walukurritje), and 2009, with Tingari Men at Wilkingkarra (Lake Mackay). Linda's works are held in several major public collections, including the National Gallery of Australia, the Art Gallery of New South Wales and the Art Gallery of South Australia.|$|E
5|$|Josepha Petrick began {{painting}} about 1990 or 1992 {{as part of}} {{the contemporary}} Indigenous art movement that had begun at Papunya in the 1970s. By 1998 her work was being collected by both private and public institutions, such as Charles Sturt University, and in 2005 a work was purchased by the National Gallery of Victoria. Her career received a significant boost when her work was included in the National Gallery of Victoria's 2006 Landmarks exhibition and its catalogue; <b>her</b> <b>painting</b> was printed opposite that of Yannima Tommy Watson, who was by this time famous, particularly for his contribution to the design of a new building for the Musée du quai Branly. Petrick's paintings have been included at exhibitions in several private galleries in Melbourne and Hong Kong, {{as well as at the}} Australian embassy in Washington in 2001.|$|E

5|$|When Minnie {{decided to}} take up {{painting}} in 2000 while she waited for her daughter Barbara to complete a canvas in an Adelaide workshop, the reception was immediately positive: she had her first solo exhibition that same year at Melbourne's Flinders Lane Gallery. She was first selected to exhibit in the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Art Award in 2002. One of her pieces, Awelye Atnwengerrp, was exhibited in the 2003 Award, in which her name was given as Minnie Motorcar Apwerl (Pwerle). The artist's asking price for the picture, A$44,000, was the second-highest in the exhibition and the highest for an artist from the central and western deserts. <b>Her</b> <b>painting</b> Awelye Atnwengerrp 2 was exhibited in the 2005 competition.|$|E
5|$|Linda Syddick was {{painting}} by 1991, when her works were hung {{in a private}} gallery—Gallery Gondwana—in Alice Springs. Her works, such as A nest of crosses, gladly borne painted for an exhibition titled Mary Mackillop: a tribute, combine traditional Indigenous painting techniques and motifs with Christian imagery and themes. Linda Syddick had two paintings included in an exhibition, From Appreciation to Appropriation, at the Flinders University Art Museum City Gallery in 2000. One—Eucharist—again looked at Christian influences in Indigenous culture; the other dealt with Hollywood influences, and was titled ET: the bicycle ride. Linda's interest in Christian iconography {{is reflected in the}} inclusion of her work The Eucharist in another Flinders University Art Museum exhibition, Holy, Holy, Holy in 2004, which examined the advent of Christianity in Australia. Other works represent her traditional country, such as <b>her</b> <b>painting</b> Tingari Men at Wilkingkarra (Lake Mackay), which was a finalist at the 2009 National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Awards. Artists of the Western Desert region, such as Linda Syddick, frequently portray figures from the Tingari cycle of 'songlines', particularly the Tingari Men. These are ancestral elders who − in the Dreaming − travelled over vast areas, performing rituals and creating the country.|$|E

50|$|She {{opened her}} first shop in Headington, Oxford, in 2000, a {{base from which}} she could sell <b>her</b> <b>paint,</b> as well as fabrics and ready-painted furniture.|$|R
50|$|Jack Spigot was {{the first}} horse that John F. <b>Herring</b> <b>painted</b> from life and the artist painted several portraits of the racehorse during and after his racing career.|$|R
25|$|From this base, she has {{continued}} to produce artworks {{in a variety of}} media, as well as launching a literary career by publishing several novels, a poetry collection, and an autobiography. <b>Her</b> <b>painting</b> style shifted to high-colored acrylics on canvas, on an amped-up scale.|$|E
25|$|The diaries and {{paintings}} by his wife, Jane Eliza Currie, provide {{a glimpse into}} the hard life of the first settlers. <b>Her</b> <b>painting</b> Panorama of the Swan River Settlement shows Fremantle in 1831. From it one can begin to appreciate the magnitude of the challenge faced by the colonists.|$|E
25|$|Bernhardt began {{painting}} {{while she}} was at the Comédie-Française; since she rarely performed more than twice a week, she wanted a new activity to fill her time. Her paintings were mostly landscapes and seascapes, with many painted at Belle-Île. <b>Her</b> <b>painting</b> teachers were close and lifelong friends Georges Clairin and Louise Abbéma. She exhibited a 2-m-tall canvas, The Young Woman and Death, at the 1878 Paris Salon.|$|E

25|$|In 1785 Körner's father died, {{leaving his}} son a {{substantial}} inheritance. This {{made it possible}} for Gottfried and Minna to marry. They did so on 7 August, and moved to Dresden, where Körner had earlier taken up a junior legal position (he eventually rose to a senior rank, consistorial councillor). Following their honeymoon, Dora moved in with them, occupying a small bedroom and setting up <b>her</b> <b>painting</b> apparatus in the common living area.|$|E
25|$|There {{is another}} reason why Ellis’ {{paintings}} are {{not strong enough to}} be called the scientific illustration. It seems that Ellis had her own taste when she choosing the object, which resulted in the limitation of botanical species in <b>her</b> <b>painting.</b> She preferred colorful and showy species rather than many small-flowered herbaceous species, for example, waterlilies were her most favorite flowers, and there was no depicting of the large and significant sunflower family in her artworks.|$|E
25|$|Thomson {{has said}} that his {{painting}} {{was the idea that}} Stella Vine used for <b>her</b> <b>painting</b> of Princess Diana, Hi Paul Can You Come Over, that launched her to fame when it was bought by Charles Saatchi in 2004. Three years before, she {{had been a member of}} the Stuckist group and also briefly married to Thomson, who said that she was aware of the media appeal of the idea, as he had shown her press cuttings of the painting.|$|E
50|$|Shaw {{came to be}} seen as {{a pioneer}} in {{progressive}} education. She was invited to lecture about finger painting and organize exhibitions. She started a factory in New York to produce <b>her</b> <b>paint.</b> Finger painting workshops were started for adults. In 1942 she became a lecturer at Teachers College, Columbia University.|$|R
25|$|In 1940 the Kriegsmarine (German Navy) requisitioned Cap Arcona, had <b>her</b> <b>painted</b> overall {{grey and}} used {{her in the}} Baltic Sea as an {{accommodation}} ship in Gotenhafen (formerly Gdynia, Poland).|$|R

25|$|Contemporary {{indigenous}} {{art works}} {{have won a}} number of Australia's principal national art prizes, including the Wynne prize, the Clemenger Contemporary Art Award and the Blake Prize for Religious Art. Indigenous awardees have included Shirley Purdie, 2007 winner of the Blake Prize with her work Stations of the Cross; 2003 Clemenger Award winner John Mawurndjul, and 2006 Clemenger winner Judy Watson. The Wynne prize has been won by contemporary indigenous artists on several occasions, including in 1999 by Gloria Petyarre with Leaves; in 2004 by George Tjungurrayi; and in 2008 by Joanne Currie Nalingu, with <b>her</b> <b>painting</b> The river is calm.|$|E
25|$|Her {{second group}} of paintings, portraits of {{the women of the}} Gonzaga family, was highly {{considered}} by Margherita Gonzaga and she commissioned many paintings from Lucrina. However, <b>her</b> <b>painting</b> had a greater increase in quality after Margherita’s death in 1618. For instance, it was widely known that portraits of important women demanded careful attention to detail and a thorough visual record of the model’s costume and accessories. These two qualities were clearly evident in Lucrina’s portrait of Eleonora Gonzaga during her marriage to Emperor Ferdinando II. Some other portraits she did included Margherita Gonzaga when she was a widow and Caterina de’ Medici Gonzaga with a striking resemblance to Saint Helena.|$|E
25|$|Parsons {{was also}} a painter. In 1959, Tony Smith {{designed}} her waterfront house-studio on the North Fork of {{the east end of}} Long Island, New York, perched on a cliff overlooking Long Island Sound, where Parsons worked on her art in her time off from the gallery. <b>Her</b> <b>painting</b> style changed in 1947, turning from small landscapes and portraits into a bold, subjective abstraction when she began to make constructions from bits of wood and other materials that washed up on the beach near her home; most often her constructions reflected the area around her North Fork home, but sometimes the pieces reflected her travels to the Caribbean and abroad.|$|E
50|$|In Toronto, {{with little}} formal {{training}} behind <b>her,</b> Pflug <b>painted</b> <b>her</b> everyday environs {{in a style}} that has been labelled magic realist.|$|R
50|$|She {{taught her}} servant Geertgen Wyntges, {{also known as}} Geertje Pieters, to mix <b>her</b> <b>paints,</b> and trained <b>her</b> as a painter too. After van Oosterwijck died, Wyntges lived independently, {{supporting}} herself as a painter.|$|R
