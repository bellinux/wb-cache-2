5|$|Bach first {{performed}} the cantata on 31 October 1725. He repeated it again, probably in 1730, with minor {{changes in the}} scoring, doubling the oboes by flutes and assigning a flute as the obbligato <b>instrument</b> <b>in</b> the alto aria.|$|E
5|$|The {{clarinet}} {{was originally}} a central <b>instrument</b> <b>in</b> jazz, {{beginning with the}} New Orleans players in the 1910s. It remained a signature instrument of jazz music {{through much of the}} big band era into the 1940s. American players Alphonse Picou, Larry Shields, Jimmie Noone, Johnny Dodds, and Sidney Bechet were all pioneers of the <b>instrument</b> <b>in</b> jazz. The B soprano was the most common instrument, but a few early jazz musicians such as Louis Nelson Delisle and Alcide Nunez preferred the C soprano, and many New Orleans jazz brass bands have used E soprano.|$|E
5|$|By the mid-1980s, synth-pop {{had helped}} {{establish}} the synthesizer {{as a primary}} <b>instrument</b> <b>in</b> mainstream pop music. It also influenced the sound of many mainstream rock acts, such as Bruce Springsteen, ZZ Top and Van Halen. It was {{a major influence on}} house music, which grew out of the post-disco dance club culture of the early 1980s as some DJs attempted to make the less pop-oriented music that also incorporated influences from Latin soul, dub, rap music, and jazz.|$|E

5|$|Nocturne (1958) is {{the last}} of the orchestral cycles. As in the Serenade, Britten set words by a range of poets, who here include Shakespeare, Coleridge, Keats, Shelley, Tennyson and Wilfred Owen. The whole cycle is darker in tone than the Serenade, with pre-echoes of the War Requiem. All the songs have subtly {{different}} orchestrations, with a prominent obbligato part for a different <b>instrument</b> <b>in</b> each.|$|E
5|$|Rhodes {{subsequently}} re-acquired {{the rights}} to the <b>instrument</b> <b>in</b> 1997. However, by this time he was in ill health and died in December 2000. In 2007, a re-formed Rhodes Music Corporation introduced a reproduction of the original electric piano, called the Rhodes Mark 7.

40|$|Abstract Background Physical {{activity}} self-report <b>instruments</b> <b>in</b> the US {{have largely}} been developed for and validated in White samples. Despite calls to validate existing <b>instruments</b> <b>in</b> more diverse samples, relatively few instruments have been validated in US Blacks. Emerging evidence suggests that these instruments may have differential validity in Black populations. Purpose This report reviews and evaluates the validity and reliability of self-reported measures of physical activity in Blacks and makes recommendations for future directions. Methods A systematic literature review was conducted to identify published reports with construct or criterion validity evaluated in samples that included Blacks. Studies that reported results separately for Blacks were examined. Results The review identified 10 <b>instruments</b> validated <b>in</b> nine manuscripts. Criterion validity correlations tended to be low to moderate. No study has compared the validity of multiple <b>instruments</b> <b>in</b> a single sample of Blacks. Conclusion There {{is a need for}} efforts validating self-report physical activity <b>instruments</b> <b>in</b> Blacks, particularly those evaluating the relative validity of <b>instruments</b> <b>in</b> a single sample. </p...|$|R

5|$|The Hammond organ {{has also}} been {{emulated}} in software. The most prominent emulator in this field has been the Native Instruments B4 series, which has been praised for its attention to detail and choice of features.

5|$|The Rhodes piano {{became a}} popular <b>instrument</b> <b>in</b> jazz {{in the late}} 1960s, {{particularly}} for several sidemen who played with Miles Davis. Herbie Hancock first encountered the <b>instrument</b> <b>in</b> 1968 while booked for a session with Davis. He immediately became an enthusiast, noting that the amplification allowed him to be heard much more easily in groups {{when compared to the}} piano. Hancock continued to experiment with the Rhodes over the next few years, including playing it through a wah wah. Another former Davis sideman, Chick Corea started using the Rhodes prominently during the 1970s, as did Weather Report founder Joe Zawinul. From 1969's In a Silent Way and Bitches Brew onwards, the Rhodes became the most prominent keyboard on Davis's recordings until the mid-1970s. Vince Guaraldi started using a Rhodes in 1968, and toured with both a piano and a Rhodes. He achieved particular prominence with his soundtrack music for A Charlie Brown Christmas and other Peanuts / Charlie Brown films.|$|E

5|$|As Farmer's {{reputation}} grew, he {{expanded from}} bebop into more experimental forms through working with composers such as George Russell and Teddy Charles. He {{went on to}} join Gerry Mulligan's quartet and, with Benny Golson, to co-found the Jazztet. Continuing to develop his own sound, Farmer switched from trumpet to the warmer flugelhorn in the early 1960s, and he helped to establish the flugelhorn as a soloist's <b>instrument</b> <b>in</b> jazz. He settled in Europe in 1968 and continued to tour internationally until his death. Farmer recorded more than 50 albums under his own name, a dozen with the Jazztet, and dozens more with other leaders. His playing {{is known for its}} individuality – most noticeably, its lyricism, warmth of tone and sensitivity.|$|E

5|$|As a child, Margaret {{participated in}} many singing contests; {{as her father}} recalled, she usually lost. She {{attended}} the Ińsko school complex (a primary school and a gimnazjum), and concurrently studied saxophone (initially clarinet) at the Ignacy Jan Paderewski first degree State Music School in Choszczno. Shortly after finishing music school, her nasal septum was damaged in a bicycle accident which temporarily prevented her from playing an <b>instrument.</b> <b>In</b> addition to saxophone classes, Margaret studied singing at the Jazz Academy in Kraków and took private singing lessons from renowned vocal coach Elżbieta Zapendowska. At age sixteen she moved to Szczecin, where she graduated from Liceum ogólnokształcące 14. At this time she adopted her stage name, Margaret, the English equivalent of Małgorzata.|$|E
5|$|Clarinets {{have the}} largest pitch range of common woodwinds. The {{intricate}} key organization that makes this possible can make the playability of some passages awkward. The bottom of the clarinet's written range {{is defined by the}} keywork on each instrument, standard keywork schemes allowing a low E on the common B clarinet. The lowest concert pitch depends on the transposition of the <b>instrument</b> <b>in</b> question. The nominal highest note of the B clarinet is a semitone higher than the highest note of the oboe. Since the clarinet has a wider range of notes, the lowest note of the B clarinet is significantly deeper (a minor or major sixth) than the lowest note of the oboe.|$|E

5|$|Musical {{instruments}} {{used by the}} Egyptian culture before 2700 BC bore striking {{similarity to}} those of Mesopotamia, leading historians {{to conclude that the}} civilizations must have been in contact with one another. Sachs notes that Egypt did not possess any instruments that the Sumerian culture did not also possess. However, by 2700 BC the cultural contacts seem to have dissipated; the lyre, a prominent ceremonial <b>instrument</b> <b>in</b> Sumer, did not appear in Egypt for another 800 years. Clappers and concussion sticks appear on Egyptian vases as early as 3000 BC. The civilization also made use of sistra, vertical flutes, double clarinets, arched and angular harps, and various drums.|$|E
5|$|Swing clarinetists such as Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw, and Woody Herman led {{successful}} big {{bands and}} smaller groups from the 1930s onward. Duke Ellington, active from the 1920s to the 1970s, used the clarinet as lead <b>instrument</b> <b>in</b> his works, with several {{players of the}} instrument (Barney Bigard, Jimmy Hamilton, and Russell Procope) spending {{a significant portion of}} their careers in his orchestra. Harry Carney, primarily Ellington's baritone saxophonist, occasionally doubled on bass clarinet. Meanwhile, Pee Wee Russell had a long and successful career in small groups.|$|E
5|$|The Mellotron {{became more}} popular after the Beatles used it on several tracks.

Later models such as the M400, the best selling model, dispensed with the accompaniments and some sound selection controls {{in order to be}} used by touring musicians. The instrument became less popular in the 1980s due to the introduction of polyphonic synthesizers and samplers, despite a number of high-profile uses from Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and XTC.|$|E
