25|$|Obama's {{presidency}} saw {{the continuation}} of battles between both parties over the confirmation of <b>judicial</b> <b>nominees.</b> Democrats continually accused Republicans of stalling nominees throughout Obama's tenure. After several nomination battles, Senate Democrats in 2013 reformed {{the use of the}} filibuster so that it could no longer be used on executive or judicial nominations (excluding the Supreme Court). Republicans took over the Senate after the 2014 elections, giving them the power to block any judicial nominee, and the 114th Congress confirmed just 20 <b>judicial</b> <b>nominees,</b> the lowest number of confirmations since the 82nd Congress. Obama's <b>judicial</b> <b>nominees</b> were significantly more diverse than those of previous administrations, with more appointments going to women and minorities.|$|E
25|$|Obama's second mid-term {{election}} {{turned into}} another wave election, as Republicans won {{control of the}} Senate and picked up several governorships. Mitch McConnell replaced Harry Reid as Senate Majority Leader, while Reid became the Senate Minority Leader. Republican control of the Senate gave the party the power to block Obama's executive and <b>judicial</b> <b>nominees.</b> The Republican waves in 2010 and 2014 defeated many young Democratic candidates, weakening the farm team of several state Democratic parties.|$|E
25|$|As {{there are}} no Democratic U.S. Senators from Tennessee, President Barack Obama asked Cohen to {{recommend}} <b>judicial</b> <b>nominees.</b> Cohen recommended Judge Bernice Donald for United States Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit, Judge John Fowlkes and Sheryl H. Lipman for District Court Judge for the Western District of Tennessee. All three have been confirmed by the United States Senate. Cohen also recommended Ed Stanton III as District Court Judge for Western Tennessee. Stanton is still waiting for confirmation by the United States Senate.|$|E

25|$|In January 2001, Miers did follow Bush to Washington, D.C., {{serving as}} Assistant to the President and Staff Secretary {{during the first}} two years of his presidency. In that role, she opposed the administration's 2001 {{decision}} to stop cooperating with the ABA rating of <b>judicial</b> <b>nominees.</b> In 2003, she was appointed Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy. In November 2004, Bush named her to succeed Alberto Gonzales, his nominee for Attorney General, to the post of White House Counsel, the chief legal adviser for the Office of the President.|$|E
25|$|He {{was well}} known for his {{military}} service (including years as a tortured POW) and competing in the 2000 presidential campaign, in which he won the New Hampshire primary before eventually losing the nomination to George W. Bush. McCain also impressed many Republicans with his strong support for President Bush's re-election campaign in 2004, and {{his role in the}} confirmation of many of Bush's <b>judicial</b> <b>nominees.</b> Since 1993, he also has served as chairman of the International Republican Institute, a U.S. government-funded organization involved in supporting political democracy around the world.|$|E
25|$|With {{no other}} way to block confirmation, the Senate Democrats started to {{filibuster}} <b>judicial</b> <b>nominees.</b> On February 12, 2003, Miguel Estrada, a nominee for the D.C. Circuit, became the first court of appeals nominee ever to be filibustered. Later, nine other conservative court of appeals nominees were also filibustered. These nine were Priscilla Owen, Charles W. Pickering, Carolyn Kuhl, David W. McKeague, Henry Saad, Richard Allen Griffin, William H. Pryor, William Gerry Myers III and Janice Rogers Brown. Three of the nominees (Estrada, Pickering and Kuhl) withdrew their nominations {{before the end of the}} 108th Congress.|$|E

She was assigned first to the office of First Lady Hillary Clinton, where she assisted in the Clinton Administration's effort to pass comprehensive Health Care legislation, and later to the staff of Vice President Al Gore where she worked on the Brady Handgun Prevention Act, the Violent Crime Control and the Enforcement Act of 1994 and various other domestic policy initiatives. She also helped to vet <b>judicial</b> <b>nominees</b> and worked as a speech writer for the Vice President.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the 109th Congress, the Gang of 14 deal expired. On November 7, 2006, the Democrats retook {{control in}} the 110th Congress. Starting in January 2007, they possessed a 51-49 {{majority}} in the Senate. As the new Senate majority, the Democrats easily blocked several conservative appellate <b>judicial</b> <b>nominees</b> without resorting to the filibuster. Conservative appellate nominees like Peter Keisler, Robert J. Conrad and Steve A. Matthews were blocked in committee and never given a hearing. If a Supreme Court justice had chosen to retire during the 110th Congress, {{it would have been easy}} for the Democrats to have blocked his proposed replacement in committee, or even by a party-line vote on the Senate floor, if it somehow came to that. As it developed, no Supreme Court justice retired or died during the 110th Congress.|$|E
500|$|In May 2005, McCain led the {{so-called}} Gang of 14 in the Senate, which established {{a compromise that}} preserved the ability of senators to filibuster <b>judicial</b> <b>nominees,</b> but only in [...] "extraordinary circumstances". The compromise took the steam out of the filibuster movement, but some Republicans remained disappointed that the compromise did not eliminate filibusters of <b>judicial</b> <b>nominees</b> in all circumstances. McCain subsequently cast Supreme Court confirmation votes in favor of John Roberts and Samuel Alito, calling them [...] "two of the finest justices ever appointed to the United States Supreme Court." ...|$|E

500|$|At the outset, Judicature {{magazine}} {{noted that}} the [...] "Senate Democrats were {{gearing up for the}} approaching confirmation hearings" [...] before the first set of nominees were sent to the Senate.

500|$|McConnell {{immediately}} launched ads accusing Bevin {{of taking}} taxpayer bailouts, citing his acceptance of state grants to rebuild Bevin Brothers. Bevin responded with ads accusing McConnell of voting for higher taxes, government bailouts, {{increases in the}} debt ceiling, and confirmation of liberal <b>judicial</b> <b>nominees.</b> McConnell's next ad featured Bevin telling an audience [...] "I have no tax delinquency problem, nor have I ever," [...] then claimed his businesses had failed to pay taxes eight times and Bevin was late on a tax payment on his $1.2 million vacation home in Greenwood, Maine, in 2007. PolitiFact.com rated the ad [...] "Mostly False", saying that Bevin Brothers incurred the delinquent taxes in 2008 and {{the second quarter of}} 2009, when the extent of Bevin's involvement with the company was [...] "unclear". Regarding the vacation home, PolitiFact noted that Bevin's escrow company changed in 2007, and the new company failed to pay the property taxes on the home from escrow on time. Town records show that the taxes were paid by February 2009, and Bevin had paid them on-time every year before and after 2007. McConnell's third ad in as many weeks targeted Bevin for falsely claiming on his LinkedIn page that he attended a seminar affiliated with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The three-year program, which Bevin attended from 2006 to 2008, was actually sponsored by the MIT Enterprise Forum, which is technically unaffiliated with MIT. The discrepancy was first reported by The Hill in March 2013, and was clarified on his LinkedIn page at that time.|$|E
2500|$|On November 21, 2013, the Senate {{used the}} {{so-called}} [...] "nuclear option," [...] voting 52–48 — with all Republicans and three Democrats opposed — {{to eliminate the}} use of the filibuster on executive branch nominees and <b>judicial</b> <b>nominees,</b> except to the Supreme Court.

2500|$|In 2005, a {{group of}} Republican {{senators}} led by Majority Leader Bill Frist proposed having the presiding officer, Vice President Dick Cheney, rule that a filibuster on <b>judicial</b> <b>nominees</b> was unconstitutional, as it was inconsistent with the President's power to name judges with the advice and consent of a simple majority of senators. This {{was a response to}} the Democrats' threat to filibuster some <b>judicial</b> <b>nominees</b> of President George W. Bush. Senator Trent Lott, the junior senator from Mississippi, used the word [...] "nuclear" [...] to describe the plan, and so it became known as the [...] "nuclear option".|$|E

2500|$|His view on senatorial {{responsibilities}} for Supreme Court nominees has evolved. [...] Regarding President George Bush's 2006 nomination of Samuel Alito, Crapo {{said in a}} press release, [...] "All of the President's nominees deserve up-and-down votes and not efforts to obstruct <b>judicial</b> <b>nominees</b> for political purposes. Judges are not politicians, and hopefully, Judge Alito's nomination will {{put an end to}} the politics which have crept into the nomination process." ...|$|E
2500|$|Members of {{the society}} helped to {{encourage}} President George W. Bush’s decision to terminate a nearly half-century-old practice of rating qualifications for office for <b>judicial</b> <b>nominees</b> by the American Bar Association. Since the administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, the American Bar Association provided the service to presidents of both parties and the nation by vetting the qualifications of those under consideration for lifetime appointment to the federal judiciary. The society alleged that the bar association showed a liberal bias in its recommendations. Examples given included that while former Supreme Court clerks nominated to the Court of Appeals by Democrats had an average rating of slightly below [...] "well qualified", similar Republican nominees were rated on average as only [...] "qualified/well qualified." [...] In addition the bar association gave Ronald Reagan's <b>judicial</b> <b>nominees</b> Richard Posner and Frank H. Easterbrook its lowest possible ratings of [...] "qualified/not qualified", and Judges Posner and Easterbrook {{have gone on to}} become the two most highly cited judges in the federal appellate judiciary.|$|E
