60|$|Wherever {{there was}} space and foothold, people swarmed, little people, small and {{minutely}} clear, except where the sunset touched them to indistinguishable gold. They clambered up the tottering walls, they clung in wreaths and groups about the high-standing pillars. They swarmed along the <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> of ruins. The air {{was full of}} their shouting, and they were pressing and swaying towards the central space.|$|E
50|$|On 21 June 2016 the club's {{management}} {{presented the}} official emblem at the 2016/2017 season press conference. The current symbol {{is based on}} the symbol that served the club from the 1995/1996 season to the 2015/2016 season: the lower half circle shape is half a soccer ball, the top half contains a chimney symbolizing the municipal building, a symbol of the original executive, and the top <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> display the club's Hebrew and English name. In addition, the crest is displayed above the round star; this star represents that the club has won championships.|$|E
5000|$|The {{aerobatic}} teams {{established on}} the basis of the 1st and 2nd squadrons already had their own names and symbols. Several proposals were raised for the 3rd group. The first one suggested the name [...] "Ants", while the commanding squadron favored [...] "Fugitive Hussars", but got rejected. The name [...] "Grizzlies" [...] also came up, but wasn't accepted because of the direct allusion to the Russia-North American relationship. It was then the commander of aviation of the Moscow Military District, Lt. Gen. Antoshkin proposed the name of [...] "Celestial Hussars" [...] that satisfied everyone. Coloring scheme was soon hammered down to white, blue and red, and a patterned buckle pelisse was painted at the bottom of the fuselage. The emblem was a circle on a white background, with for attack aircraft in a diamond formation, and the crossed hussar sabers directly, the [...] "Celestial Hussars, Kubinka" [...] inscription was put on the <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle.</b> The new scheme was shown on the Su-25s to the audience on 12 April 1992, at the [...] "Aviadvigateli-92" [...] international exhibition held in Kubinka.|$|E
5000|$|The line usually {{extends beyond}} <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> {{on one side}} by a {{distance}} roughly equal to <b>the</b> diameter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle.</b>|$|R

60|$|While we {{were thus}} feasting and chatting on <b>the</b> green sward <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region which seemed {{destined to be}} our future home, an object {{suddenly}} appeared among the bushes, near <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> light cast by our camp-fire.|$|R
40|$|The main {{result of}} this paper is a (2 + epsilon) -approximation scheme for the minimum {{dominating}} set problem on circle graphs. We first present an O(n(2)) time 8 -approximation algorithm for this problem and then extend it to an O(n(3) + 6 /epsilonn([6 /epsilon+ 1]) m) time (2 + epsilon) -approximation scheme for this problem. Here n and m are the number of vertices and the number of <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> graph. We then present simple modifications to this algorithm that yield (3 + epsilon) -approximation schemes for the minimum connected and the minimum total dominating set problems on circle graphs. Keil (1993, Discrete Appl. Math. 42, 51 - 63) shows that these problems are NP-complete for circle graphs and leaves open the problem of devising approximation algorithms for them. These are the first O(1) -approximation algorithms for domination problems on circle graphs. ...|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{northern}} <b>circle</b> {{is smaller}} {{and consists of}} rounded river stones (which also fill <b>the</b> southern <b>circle).</b> In its centre is a single stone; another stone is found on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle.</b> This circle may have originated as a timber circle.|$|R

60|$|Suddenly the crackling, the shots, the yells ceased, or were {{drowned in}} {{a volume of}} greater sound. Neale ran to the window. The flare from the burning tents was dying down. But into <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> light he saw loom a line of horsemen.|$|R
5000|$|Originally, <b>the</b> {{markings}} consisted <b>of</b> {{a circle}} with a vertical line from <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> pointing in <b>the</b> direction <b>of</b> travel (straight ahead, left turn, right turn). Other common markings are a circle X to denote wrong way, and a circled horizontal line to denote caution.|$|R
60|$|In {{order to}} {{accomplish}} this more thoroughly I walked round both fires and readjusted the logs, sending up showers of sparks as I did so. Then I went to <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> light, in <b>the</b> centre <b>of</b> which our camp lay, and peered into <b>the</b> gloom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dark forest.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> stone <b>circle</b> once {{probably}} {{consisted of}} 22 granite blocks, from which 10 still survive. Six stones stand upright, one sits half a metre out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground, the others remain {{lying in the}} soil. The stones are all about 1 m high, the highest measure approximately 2 m and stand to northern <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle.</b> <b>The</b> stone <b>circle</b> originally described a circle with a diameter of approximately 22 m. <b>The</b> stone <b>circle</b> may have belonged with the nearby barrow to an extensive cult district.|$|R
50|$|University of Florida {{archaeologist}} Jerald Milanich {{was concerned}} that there was, from the previous apartment block, a septic tank that was aligned perfectly at <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle.</b> He suggested that <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> could {{be nothing more than}} a sink for the sewage from the septic tank, an idea that understandably drew a certain amount of interest.|$|R

60|$|Several times, as Dick {{stood in}} the waggon, rifle in hand, {{straining}} his eyes at the darkness, he fancied he saw indistinct shadowy forms moving at <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> light Two or three times he raised his rifle to take aim, but the objects were so indistinct that he doubted whether his fancy had not deceived him.|$|R

50|$|The {{neighborhood}} {{is defined by}} Tenley Circle which lies at <b>the</b> intersection <b>of</b> Nebraska Avenue, Wisconsin Avenue, and Yuma Street. On Tenley Circle itself is St. Ann's Catholic Church, a large imposing stone church which serves area Catholics. On <b>the</b> opposite side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> is Wisconsin Avenue Baptist Church. American University's Washington College <b>of</b> Law, on <b>the</b> site <b>of</b> <b>the</b> former Immaculata School, also bounds <b>the</b> western <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle.</b>|$|R
50|$|As light {{passes through}} the 60° apex angle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{hexagonal}} ice prisms it is deflected twice resulting in deviation angles ranging from 22° to 50°. <b>The</b> angle <b>of</b> minimum deviation is almost 22° (or more specifically 21.84° on average; 21.54° for red light and 22.37° for blue light). This wavelength-dependent variation in refraction causes <b>the</b> inner <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> to be reddish while the outer edge is bluish.|$|R
50|$|The {{distance}} from <b>the</b> front <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> to where <b>the</b> discus has landed is measured, and distances are rounded {{down to the}} nearest centimetre. The competitor's best throw from <b>the</b> allocated number <b>of</b> throws, typically three to six, is recorded, and the competitor who legally throws the discus the farthest is declared the winner. Ties are broken by determining which thrower has the longer second-best throw.|$|R

500|$|In 1957, Coxeter {{obtained}} Escher's {{permission to}} use two of his drawings in his paper [...] "Crystal symmetry and its generalizations". He sent Escher a copy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> paper; Escher recorded that Coxeter's figure of a hyperbolic tessellation [...] "gave me quite a shock": the infinite regular repetition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tiles in the hyperbolic plane, growing rapidly smaller towards <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle,</b> was precisely {{what he wanted to}} allow him to represent infinity on a two-dimensional plane.|$|R
60|$|Whatever were Mr. Bumble's intentions, however (and {{no doubt}} they were <b>of</b> <b>the</b> best): it {{unfortunately}} happened, as has been twice before remarked, that the table was a round one; consequently Mr. Bumble, moving his chair by little and little, soon began to diminish the distance {{between himself and the}} matron; and, continuing to travel round <b>the</b> outer <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle,</b> brought his chair, in time, close to that in which the matron was seated.|$|R

5|$|South <b>of</b> here, <b>the</b> Route 413 {{continues}} as a divided highway with one lane {{in each direction}} passing through an area <b>of</b> commercial businesses. <b>The</b> road comes to another oblong traffic circle, with intersections at Oakland Avenue, Washington Avenue, and Lincoln Avenue.

60|$|Suddenly the {{quietness}} {{split to}} {{a chorus of}} snappy, high-strung, strange barks. They sounded wild, yet they held something of a friendly or inquisitive note. Presently gray forms could be descried just at <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> <b>of</b> light. Soft rustlings of stealthy feet surrounded the camp, and then barks and yelps broke out all around. It was a restless and sneaking pack of animals, thought Helen; she was glad after the chorus ended and with a few desultory, spiteful yelps the coyotes went away.|$|R
50|$|The {{quantity}} and concentration of insoluble antigen-antibody complexes at <b>the</b> outer <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> increase with time. The clarity and density <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle's</b> outer <b>edge</b> therefore also increase with time. As a result, measurements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sizes <b>of</b> <b>circles</b> and graphs produced from these measurements {{are often more}} accurate after circles have stopped expanding than they are when circles are still enlarging. For those reasons, it is often more desirable to take measurements after all circles have reached their end points {{than it is to}} take measurements while some or all circles are still enlarging.|$|R
5000|$|As it is {{seen from}} <b>the</b> {{behaviour}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sine function, this quantity has the maximum for the backward scattering ( [...] ; the light is reflected perpendicularly and returns), and the zero minimum for the scattering from <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> directly forward (...) [...] It confirms the intuitive expectations that <b>the</b> mirror <b>circle</b> acts like a diverging lens, and a thin beam is more diluted the closer {{it is from the}} edge defined with respect to the incoming direction.

60|$|There was {{a second}} {{performance}} in the evening, and the tent was lighted up. Troy had taken his part very quietly this time, venturing to introduce a few speeches on occasion; and was just concluding it when, whilst standing at <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> contiguous to <b>the</b> first row <b>of</b> spectators, he observed within a yard <b>of</b> him <b>the</b> eye <b>of</b> a man darted keenly into his side features.

5000|$|Like the heuweltjies and Mima mounds, <b>the</b> cause <b>of</b> fairy <b>circles</b> {{has long}} been a puzzle and the {{investigation}} has proved challenging. One favoured theory is that the distinct vegetation patterns are a population-level consequence of competition for scarce water, as the plants [...] "organise" [...] themselves to maximise access to scarce resources. The circular barren patches capture water which then flows to <b>the</b> outer <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ring. More water available increases biomass and roots which leads to the soil becoming looser. The less dense soil allows more water to penetrate and feed the vegetation, creating a feedback loop supporting the plants at <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle.</b>|$|R
60|$|Just within <b>the</b> inner <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> stood a soldier, in <b>the</b> {{military}} attire <b>of</b> {{a strange}} nation; and without {{it was his}} war-horse, in <b>the</b> centre <b>of</b> a collection of mounted domestics, seemingly in readiness to undertake some distant journey. <b>The</b> vestments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stranger announced him to be one who held a responsible situation near <b>the</b> person <b>of</b> <b>the</b> captain <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Canadas; and who, as it would now seem, finding his errand of peace frustrated by <b>the</b> fierce impetuosity <b>of</b> his allies, was content to become a silent and sad spectator <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fruits <b>of</b> a contest that he had arrived too late to anticipate.|$|R
