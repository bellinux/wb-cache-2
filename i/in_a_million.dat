5|$|About 1 in 300 to 500 {{people have}} {{mutations}} in the LDLR gene that encodes the LDL receptor protein, which normally removes LDL from the circulation, or apolipoprotein B (ApoB), {{which is the}} part of LDL that binds with the receptor; mutations in other genes are rare. People who have one abnormal copy (are heterozygous) of the LDLR gene may develop cardiovascular disease prematurely at the age of 30 to 40. Having two abnormal copies (being homozygous) may cause severe cardiovascular disease in childhood. Heterozygous FH is a common genetic disorder, inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, occurring in 1:500 people in most countries; homozygous FH is much rarer, occurring in 1 <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>million</b> births.|$|E

5|$|Most teleost {{species are}} oviparous, having {{external}} fertilisation with both eggs and sperm being {{released into the}} water for fertilisation. Internal fertilisation occurs in 500 to 600 species of teleosts but is more typical for Chondrichthyes and many tetrapods. This involves the male inseminating the female with an intromittent organ. Fewer than one <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>million</b> of externally fertilised eggs survives to develop into a mature fish, {{but there is a}} much better chance of survival among the offspring of members of about a dozen families which are viviparous. In these, the eggs are fertilised internally and retained in the female during development. Some of these species, like the live-bearing aquarium fish in the Poeciliidae family, are ovoviviparous; each egg has a yolk sac which nourishes the developing embryo, and when this is exhausted, the egg hatches and the larva is expelled into the water column. Other species, like the splitfins in the family Goodeidae, are fully viviparous, with the developing embryo nurtured from the maternal blood supply via a placenta-like structure that develops in the uterus. Oophagy is practised by a few species, such as Nomorhamphus ebrardtii; the mother lays unfertilised eggs on which the developing larvae feed in the uterus, and intrauterine cannibalism has been reported in some halfbeaks.|$|E

25|$|False positives {{can also}} produce serious and counter-intuitive {{problems}} when the condition being searched for is rare, as in screening. If a test has a false positive {{rate of one}} in ten thousand, but only one <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>million</b> samples (or people) is a true positive, most of the positives detected by that test will be false. The probability that an observed positive result is a false positive may be calculated using Bayes' theorem.|$|E
25|$|By {{analyzing}} the polarization {{in the combined}} light of the planet and star (about one part <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>million),</b> these measurements can in principle be made with very high sensitivity, as polarimetry is not limited by {{the stability of the}} Earth's atmosphere. Another main advantage is that polarimetry allows for determination of the composition of the planet's atmosphere. The main disadvantage is that it {{will not be able to}} detect planets without atmospheres. Larger planets and planets with higher albedo are easier to detect through polarimetry, as they reflect more light.|$|E

25|$|Records {{of solar}} eclipses {{have been kept}} since ancient times. Eclipse dates {{can be used for}} chronological dating of {{historical}} records. A Syrian clay tablet, in the Ugaritic language, records a solar eclipse which occurred on March 5, 1223 B.C., while Paul Griffin argues that a stone in Ireland records an eclipse on November 30, 3340 B.C. Positing classical-era astronomers' use of Babylonian eclipse records mostly from the 13th century BC provides a feasible and mathematically consistent explanation for the Greek finding all three lunar mean motions (synodic, anomalistic, draconitic) to a precision of about one part <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>million</b> or better. Chinese historical records of solar eclipses date back over 4,000 years and have been used to measure changes in the Earth's rate of spin.|$|E

She was quickly cast in A Kick Up the Eighties and Three of a Kind. becoming the first British woman to be offered her own sketch comedy show. Her performance earned her a BAFTA award in 1984. She became a household name with the British media affectionately dubbing her 'Our Trace.' In 1983, she started a successful (and brief) music career, which extended itself across the pond in the United States. In 1985, she teamed with comedians Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders in the sitcom Girls on Top. Ullman's husband, Allan McKeown, a successful television producer, convinced her to take a gamble on a career in America. After turning down due to creative differences, she teamed with famed television and film producer James L. Brooks who had {{a deal with the}} yet-to-be launched Fox network. They created and launched a sketch comedy vehicle The Tracey Ullman Show in 1987. Ullman received critical acclaim and was rewarded with a slew of accolades. The show would go on to win the Fox network's first Emmy award. The Tracey Ullman Show, while American-based, included Ullman's British sensibility with a variety of British characters created for her to play alongside American. Cartoon bumpers, The Simpsons were featured in the show.|$|E
