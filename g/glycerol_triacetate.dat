40|$|The {{kinetics}} of {{photoinduced processes}} in the hydrogen bonded complex between N-methyl- 3 - hydroxynaphthalimide and 1 -methylimidazole was studied in a wide temperature range in ethyl acetate and <b>glycerol</b> <b>triacetate.</b> The proton transfer within the excited complex {{was found to be}} very fast because of its negligible activation energy. The fairly intense dual Ñuorescence was assigned to hydrogen bonded and solvent separated ion pairs. Kinetic parameters for the various deactivation pathways of these excited species were derived from the combined analysis of the steady-state and the time-resolved Ñuorescence results. The Arrhenius pre-exponential factor of the transition from the solvent separated into the hydrogen bonded ion pair proved to be more than two orders of magnitude larger in <b>glycerol</b> <b>triacetate</b> compared with that in ethyl acetate, whereas the other processes showed less viscosity dependence. The radiationless energy dissipation rate of the hydrogen bonded ion pair was insensitive to the experimental conditions. However, thermal enhanced internal conversion was observed for the solvent separated ion pair...|$|E
40|$|Five organic esters with {{different}} curing speeds: propylene carbonate (i. e. high-speed ester A); 1, 4 -butyrolactone; <b>glycerol</b> <b>triacetate</b> (i. e. medium-speed ester B); glycerol diacetate; dibasic ester (DBE) (i. e. low-speed ester C), {{were chosen to}} react with alkaline phenolic resin to analyze the application conditions of ester cured alkaline phenolic resin. The relationships between the curing performances of the resin (including pH value, gel pH value, gel time of resin solution, heat release rate of the curing reaction and tensile strength of the resin sand) {{and the amount of}} added organic ester and curing temperature were investigated. The results indicated the following: (1) The optimal added amount of organic ester should be 25 wt. %- 30 wt. % of alkaline phenolic resin and it must be above 20 wt. %- 50 wt. % of the organic ester hydrolysis amount. (2) High-speed ester A (propylene carbonate) has a higher curing speed than 1, 4 -butyrolactone, and they were both used as high-speed esters. Glycerol diacetate is not a high-speed ester in alkaline phenolic resin although it was used as a high-speed ester in ester cured sodium silicate sand; glycerol diacetate and <b>glycerol</b> <b>triacetate</b> can be used as medium-speed esters in alkaline phenolic resin. (3) High-speed ester A, medium-speed ester B (<b>glycerol</b> <b>triacetate)</b> and low-speed ester C (dibasic ester, i. e., DBE) should be used below 15 ìC, 35 ìC and 50 ìC, respectively. High-speed ester A or low-speed ester C should not be used alone but mixed with medium-speed ester B to improve the strength of the resin sand. (4) There should be a suitable solid content (generally 45 wt. %- 65 wt. % of resin), alkali content (generally 10 wt. %- 15 wt. % of resin) and viscosity of alkaline phenolic resin (generally 50 - 300 mPa≤s) in the preparation of alkaline phenolic resin. Finally, the technique conditions of alkaline phenolic resin preparation and the application principles of organic ester were discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{thermodynamic}} and kinetic {{aspects of}} the methanolysis and hydrolysis reactions of <b>glycerol</b> <b>triacetate</b> or triacetin, a model triacylglycerol compound, were investigated by using Density Functional Theory (DFT) at the B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 ++G(d,p) level of calculation. Twelve elementary steps of triacetin methanolysis were studied under acid-catalyzed and base-catalyzed conditions. The mechanism of acid-catalyzed methanolysis reaction {{which has not been}} reported yet for any esters was proposed. The effects of substitution, methanolysis/hydrolysis position, solvent and face of nucleophilic attack on the free energy of reaction and activation energy were examined. The prediction confirmed the facile position at the middle position of glycerol observed by NMR techniques. The calculated activation energy and the trends of those factors agree with existing experimental observations in biodiesel production...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{modified}} flax fibers by plasticizer absorption in poly(L-lactic acid) composites was investigated. The plasticizes chosen were triethyl citrate (TEC), tributyl citrate (TBC) and <b>glycerol</b> <b>triacetate</b> (GTA), which {{were derived from}} natural sources. Characterization was performed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). The morphology was examined from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical microscopy (OM). The {{results showed that the}} plasticizer caused a marked increase in the storage modulus of the composites, which could be due to an improvement in the morphology of the matrix and a smoother surface coverage of the fibers by the matrix. The thermal properties were also affected, in which the glass transition temperature (Tg), the crystallization temperature (Tc) and the crystallinity (Xc) were reduced depending on the plasticizer. The citrate esters revealed to be the most effective plasticizers of those tested...|$|E
40|$|The {{interfacial}} {{shear strength}} (IFSS), evaluated by single fibre pull-out tests was quantified for various biopolymer-flax fibre composites that were modified with additives. The additives included a plasticiser (<b>glycerol</b> <b>triacetate)</b> (GTA) absorbed onto/into the fibres, 4, 4 &# 039;-thiodiphenol (TDP) that {{is capable of}} forming hydrogen bonds between the matrix and cellulose from the fibres, and a hyperbranched polyester (HBP) to impart improved fracture toughness. Fibres were washed with acetone to remove the surface impurities and dried under vacuum before absorption of plasticiser and adsorption of thiodiphenol. It was found that the different additives significantly influenced the IFSS for the biopolymer-flax fibre systems while extraction with acetone had a no effect on the IFSS compared with the untreated fibres. The use of TDP imparted the most significant increase in IFSS whilst the HBP had an opposing effect. The use of ESEM corroborated with the findings of the single fibre pull-out tests...|$|E
40|$|Solvatochromic {{dynamics}} and internal charge transfer kinetics of dimethylaminobenzonitrile (DMABN) dissolved in <b>glycerol</b> <b>triacetate</b> (GTA) {{have been investigated}} by means of time resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. After pulse excitation in correspondence of the high-frequency absorption, several dynamical features of the typical dual fluorescence spectra observed for DMABN in polar solvents are revealed. A precursor-successor behaviour for the observed decay of the low-frequency band is measured. These features are rationalized, at a semi-quantitative level, {{in terms of a}} stochastic model in which coupling of the fluorescent probe with the polar environment is explicitly taken in account. Ingredients of the model are the potential energy surface for the probe internal coordinates, and hydrodynamic and dielectric properties of the solvent. The comparison of simulations and experimental observations is satisfactory, and further support is given to the interpretation of the internal charge transfer dynamics in DMABN, and homologues, as a reversible interconversion process with low intrinsic energy barrier and strong coupling to the solvent environment...|$|E
40|$|Bionanocomposite films {{prepared}} with melt compounding and film blowing were evaluated for packaging applications. The nanocomposite masterbatch with 75 wt. % polylactic acid (PLA), 5 wt. % chitin nanocrystals (ChNCs) and 20 wt. % <b>glycerol</b> <b>triacetate</b> plasticizer (GTA) was melt compounded and then diluted to 1 wt. % ChNCs with PLA and polybutylene adipate-co-terephthalate (PBAT) prior to film blowing. The morphological, mechanical, optical, thermal and barrier {{properties of the}} blown nanocomposite films were studied and compared with the reference material without ChNCs. The addition of 1 wt. % ChNCs increased the tear strength by 175 % and the puncture strength by 300 %. Additionally, {{the small amount of}} chitin nanocrystals affected the glass transition temperature (Tg), which increased 4 °C compared with the reference material and slightly enhanced the films degree of crystallinity. The chitin nanocomposite also had lower fungal activity and lower electrostatic attraction between the film surfaces; leading to easy opening of the plastic bags. The barrier and optical properties as well as the thermal degradation of the films were not significantly influenced by the addition of chitin nanocrystals...|$|E
30|$|A {{series of}} {{alternative}} methods are being investigated {{to avoid the}} problems associated with the generation of glycerol in the conventional process. They all are based on achieving various glycerol derivatives in the same transesterification process. In this way, the complex and expensive additional separation process of glycerol is eliminated and the overall yield of the process increased. These novel methodologies are able to prepare methyl esters of fatty acids from lipids using different acyl acceptors instead of methanol in the transesterification process that result in glycerol derivatives as co-products [6]. For example, the transesterification reaction of triglycerides with dimethyl carbonate (DMC) [7], ethyl acetate [8], or methyl acetate [9] generates a mixture of three molecules of FAME or fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) and one of glycerol carbonate (GC) or <b>glycerol</b> <b>triacetate</b> (triacetin). These mixtures, including the glycerol derivative molecules, have physicochemical properties similar to biodiesel-like biofuel [10]. In the present case, the atom efficiency is also improved because the total number of atoms involved in the reaction is obtained in the final mixture.|$|E
40|$|International audienceFour {{processing}} tools (two twin-screw extruders, {{one being}} a mini-extruder, and two mixers) {{were used to}} prepare plasticized cellulose acetate with 20 wt% of <b>glycerol</b> <b>triacetate.</b> The goal was to deduce if {{the scale of the}} processing tool influences the dispersion of the plasticizer as estimated by the thermal, rheological, and mechanical properties of the obtained materials. The amount of polymer used ranged from 5 g for mini-extruder to a 10 kg/h for pilot-scale extruder. The specific mechanical energy was used to compare the thermal, rheological, and mechanical properties of cellulose acetate obtained with the four processing tools using different processing conditions. The measurement of the glass transition temperature was not able to discriminate the four tools used. Rheology shows differences, not as a function of small or large tools, but in terms of specific mechanical energy. The larger was the tool, the higher were the Young's moduli. This was ascribed to an overall better distribution and dispersion of the plasticizer.

40|$|Immobilised lipase B (Candida {{antarctica}} lipase B) is, perhaps unexpectedly, catalytically {{active in}} liquid ammonia and exhibits chain length selectivity in the ammonolysis of triglycerides. Using <b>glycerol</b> <b>triacetate</b> as the substrate, the ammonolysis {{of only the}} first ester linkage is catalysed by the enzyme, whereas for glycerol tributyrate, the cleavage of all three ester groups is catalysed and converted to the corresponding amide. These observations represent the first example {{of the use of}} enzymes in pure liquid ammonia, exemplifying both catalysis and selectivity. Glycerol trioleate is relatively stable in liquid ammonia but, with Candida antarctica lipase B present, readily undergoes ammonolysis to give oleamide and glycerol even at 25 °C. There is no enzyme-catalysed ammonolysis with the native lipase as it is insoluble in liquid ammonia. The solvolysis of triglycerides in liquid ammonia occurs by a stepwise conversion of the triester to diester to monoester to glycerol with one equivalent of carboxylic acid amide produced at each stage. The pseudo first-order rate constants {{for each of the three}} steps of the uncatalysed ammonolysis of triglycerides in liquid ammonia decrease with increasing alkyl chain length in the carboxyl residue as expected from a small steric effect...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to get further knowledge on the external plasticization mechanisms of melt extruded polyhydroxyl- 3 -butyrate-co- 3 -valerate (PHBV) when combined with wheat straw fibers (WSF). Different types of biodegradable substances, all authorized for food contact according to the European regulation, i. e., acetyltributyl citrate (ATBC), <b>glycerol</b> <b>triacetate</b> (GTA) and (PEG) at different molecular weights, were tested at different percentages (5, 10 and 20 wt %). Thermal and mechanical characterization of PHBV/plasticizer blends showed that a significant plasticizing effect was obtained using hydrophobic substances such as ATBC and GTA, with an increase of the elongation at break from 1. 8 % up to about 6 % for an additive content of 10 wt %. However, the incorporation of WSF in plasticized PHBV led to a dramatic decrease in the elongation at break of composites, neutralizing the increase of this parameter {{by the addition of}} the plasticizers. The stress at break of plasticized films was also significantly decreased by the introduction of fibers. Such a loss of ductility was mainly explained by the occurrence of microscopic defects in the materials induced by the presence of fibers and to a poor adhesion at the fiber/matrix interface...|$|E

Films cast from the solution in chloroform (CPLA) as well subsequently thermally treated films (TPLA) were examined. It has been found (DSC method) that CPLA is almost completely amorphous, while TPLA – highly crystalline. TPLA is less resistant and much more compliant: shows about three times smaller value of modulus and more than 30 times higher ultimate elongation. Plasticizing leads to considerable increase of deformability CPLA. Significant drop of elasticity modulus with growth of plasticizers content was observed. Plasticizers effectively reduce the value of stress maximum, increase the ultimate tensile elongation and decrease the strength of CPLA. The <b>glycerol</b> <b>triacetate</b> (TA) with more similar molecule structure to PLA {{turned out to be}} a most efficient plasticizer.

Deacetylation studies based on Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry-Time of Flight (LC-MS-TOF), High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), and spectrophotometric analysis showed that the tested esterases were able to deacetylate the plasticizer triacetin (<b>glycerol</b> <b>triacetate)</b> and glucose pentaacetate (cellulose acetate model compound). The most effective esterases for deacetylation belong to the enzyme family 2 (AXE 55, AXE 53, GAE), they deacetylated CA {{with a degree of}} acetylation of up to 1. 8. A combination of esterases and cellulases showed synergistic effects, the absolute glucose recovery for CA 1. 8 was increased from 15 % to 28 % when an enzymatic deacetylation was performed. Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase (LPMO), and cellobiohydrolase were able to cleave cellulose acetates with a degree of acetylation of up to 1. 4, whereas chitinase showed no activity. In general, the degree of substitution, chain length, and acetyl group distribution were found to affect CA degradation.

The additive GTA into Pebax 1074 matrix {{can improve the}} chain mobility, induce high CO 2 -philicity and decrease membrane crystallinity. With the increase of GTA mass content from 0 to 80 wt%, CO 2 permeability increases from similar to 135 to similar to 1800 Barrer, and CO 2 /H- 2 ideal selectivity also increases from 10 to 19. For Pebax 1074 /GTA blend membranes, the threshold mass content of GTA (C) which corresponds to the rapid increase of gas permeability is about 40 wt%. When GTA mass content is not more than C* (40 wt%), the gas permeation properties are mainly dominated by Pebax 1074. But for Pebax 1074 /GTA blend membranes with GTA mass content above C* (40 wt%), their gas permeabilities and CO 2 /light gas selectivities both change dramatically, which are mainly influenced by GTA. These membranes show excellent separation performance for CO 2 /N- 2 and CO 2 /H- 2, especially for CO 2 /H- 2 separation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

The blend ratio was 60 % of natural rubber and 40 % of poly(lactic acid). Dynamic vulcanization of natural rubber was {{performed with the}} sulfur system. The 2 mm – thick sheet samples were prepared by compression molding. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of plasticization of PLA on the mechanical and physical properties of the derived TPE. Four plasticizers were selected: tributyl acetyl citrate (TBAC), tributyl citrate (TBC), <b>glycerol</b> <b>triacetate</b> (GTA), and triethyl- 2 -acetyl citrate (TEAC). The investigated properties were the tensile properties, tear strength, thermal ageing and ozone resistance, hardness, resilience, tension set and compression set. All plasticizers increased the strain at break. TBAC and TBC increased the stress at break. All plasticizers decreased the tear strength, hardness and resilience, and slightly changed the tension and compression set. TBAC seemed to be the best plasticizer for the TPE. The presence of 4 pph (parts per hundred resin) of plasticizer provided the highest strength and tensile toughness and the strain at break increased with the increasing plasticizer content.

Here bacterial carboxylesterase EstA from Burkholderia gladioli was covalently anchored into the cell wall of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by in-frame fusion to the endogenous yeast proteins Kre 1 p, Cwp 2 p, and Flo 1 p. When p-nitrophenyl acetate was used as a substrate, the esterase specific activities of yeast expressing the protein fusions were 103 mU mg− 1 protein for Kre 1 /EstA/Cwp 2 p and 72 mU mg− 1 protein for Kre 1 /EstA/Flo 1 p. In vivo cell wall targeting was confirmed by esterase solubilization after laminarinase treatment and immunofluorescence microscopy. EstA expression resulted in cell wall-associated esterase activities of 2. 72 U mg− 1 protein for Kre 1 /EstA/Cwp 2 p and 1. 27 U mg− 1 protein for Kre 1 /EstA/Flo 1 p. Furthermore, esterase display on the yeast cell surface enabled the cells to effectively grow on the esterase-dependent carbon source <b>glycerol</b> <b>triacetate</b> (Triacetin).

Generally, the membrane properties, particularly the pore structures and interface interactions, {{have a significant impact}} on the catalytic efficiency of the EMBR. Therefore, a biomimetic interface based on a phospholipid assembled onto a polysulfone hollow-fiber membrane with perfect radial gradient pores (RGM-PSF) has been prepared in this work to construct a highly efficient and stable EMBR. On account of the special pore structure of the RGM-PSF with the apertures decreasing gradually from the inner side to the outer side, the enzyme molecules could be evenly distributed on the three-dimensional skeleton of the membrane. In addition, the supported phospholipid layer in the membrane, prepared by physical adsorption, was used for the immobilization of the enzymes, which provides sufficient linkage to prevent the enzymes from leaching but also accommodates as many enzyme molecules as possible to retain high bioactivity. The properties of the EMBR were studied by using lipase from Candida rugosa for the hydrolysis of <b>glycerol</b> <b>triacetate</b> as a model. Energy-dispersive X-ray and circular dichroism spectroscopy were employed to observe the effect of lecithin on the membrane and structure changes in the enzyme, respectively.

X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), were used to study clay dispersion, intercalation/exfoliation, {{and structure of the}} composites. XRD and TEM revealed very good dispersion and exfoliation of modified clay throughout the CA matrix. While for unmodified clay agglomeration and poor dispersion but an intercalated structure was observed. The mechanical properties of injection moulded test bars were determined by a tensile experiment giving tensile strength, Young's modulus and elongation at break. Adding plasticizer facilitated the processing and Up to 20 mass%, increased the tensile strength, Young's modulus and elongation at break as well. Higher amount of plasticizer diminished the tensile properties except elongation showing a slight increase. in all plasticized composites, organo-modified clay improved the tensile strength and at the same time, young's modulus and elongation almost remained constant. on the other hand, plasticized CA compounded with unmodified clay revealed lower properties. in a particular case, compounding of unplasticized CA with unmodified clay resulted in superior mechanical properties with a novel structure. So that, in optimum percentage - 5 mass%-of unmodified clay, tensile strength and young's modulus increased significantly by 335 % and 100 %, to 178 MPa and 8. 4 GPa, respectively. This is a dramatic improvement in strength and stiffness of CA. Adding organo-modified clay resulted in a little improvement in tensile properties. SEM pictures of the optimum composite showed a core/shell structure with high orientation in the shell part.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to study clay dispersion and intercalation/exfoliation. Dynamic mechanical {{analysis was used to}} track the temperature dependence of the storage modulus and tan delta behavior of the starch/clay hybrid. Because they were the best performing compositions, SP with 5 wt % plasticizer and SA with 20 wt % plasticizer were filled with 5 wt % nanoclay. For SP, a certain increase in modulus was observed for all clays. However, the strength was practically unchanged, and the elongation decreased in most cases. One exception was found for the 2. 5 wt % organomodified clay composition, where the elongation increased. For SA, the addition of 5 wt % nanoclay always increased the strength and modulus, in one case up to 60 and 75 %, respectively. In the particular case with 5 wt % unmodified clay, the strength, modulus, and elongation increased by 30, 40, and 1000 %, respectively. This was a dramatic improvement in the ductility of the material without losses in the strength and stiffness.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to design polymeric membranes that have very high CO 2 permeability and high mixed gas selectivity toward CO 2 rather than hydrogen. Therefore the membranes were based on "CO 2 -philic" polymers that exhibit thermodynamically favorable Lewis acid:Lewis base and hydrogen bonding interactions with CO 2. CO 2 -philic polymers that are solid at ambient temperature include polyfluoroacrylate (PFA); polyvinyl acetate (PVAc); and amorphous polylactic acid (PLA). Literature CO 2 permeability values for PVAc and PLA are disappointingly low. The cast PFA membranes from this study had low permeabilities (45 barrers at 25 oC) and very low CO 2 /H 2 selectivity of 1. 4. CO 2 -philic polymers that are liquid at ambient conditions include polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol (PPG), polybutylene glycol with a linear -((CH 2) 4 O) - repeat unit (i. e. polytetramethylene ether glycol (PTMEG)), polybutylene glycol (PBG) with a branched repeat unit, perfluoropolyether (PFPE), poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS), and polyacetoxy oxetane (PAO). A small compound, <b>glycerol</b> <b>triacetate</b> (GTA) was also considered because it is similar in chemical structure to a trimer of PVAc. These liquids were tested as supported liquid membranes (SLM) and also (with the exception of PAO and GTA) as rubbery, crosslinked materials. Mixed gas permeability was measured using equimolar mixtures of CO 2 and H 2 feed streams at one atmosphere total pressure in steady-state flux experiments over the 298 - 423 K temperature range. The most promising SLMs were those composed of a PEG, PTMEG, GTA, and PDMS.

Crosslinked versions of the PEG, PTMEG and PDMS membranes at 37 oC exhibited selectivity values of ~ 5, 6 and 3. 5, respectively, and CO 2 permeability values of ~ 50, 300, and 3000 barrers, respectively...|$|E
40|$|In this work, nanostructured biocomposite {{fibers and}} films with {{cellulose}} nanofibers (CNF), cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) and chitin nanocrystals (ChNC) were prepared using solutions mixing followed by electrospinning and melt compounding. The main processing challenges for these materials were to find parameters for: 1) fiber alignment in electrospinning, 2) feeding the nanomaterials into the extruder and 3) dispersion {{and distribution of}} the nanomaterials in the polymeric matrix. This thesis consists of three publications, which are summarized below. The first study was about random and aligned cellulose fibers prepared by electrospinning. Cellulose acetate (CA) {{was used as a}} matrix and a mixture of acetic acid and acetone (1 : 1) was used as a solvent. CNC with different concentrations (0 – 5 wt-%) were used as reinforcement. Microscopy studies showed fibers with smooth surfaces, different morphologies and diameters ranging between 200 and 3300 nm. It was found that the fiber diameters decreased with increased CNC contents. The microscopy studies also indicated well-aligned fibers. Results from dynamic mechanical thermal analysis indicated improved mechanical properties with the addition of CNC. The storage modulus of electrospun CA fibers increased from 81 to 825 MPa for fibers with 1 wt% CNC at room temperature. X-ray analysis showed that the electrospun CA fibers had a crystalline nature {{and that there was no}} significant change in crystallinity with the addition of CNC. In the second study, polylactic acid (PLA) and its nanocomposite based on CNF and <b>glycerol</b> <b>triacetate</b> (GTA) were prepared using a co-rotating twin-screw extruder. GTA was used as a plasticizer, a processing aid to facilitate nanofiber dispersion and as a liquid medium for feeding. The optical, thermal and mechanical properties were characterized and the toughening mechanism was studied. The addition of GTA (20 %) and CNF (1 %) resulted in increased degree of crystallinity and thus decreased optical transparency. Furthermore, these additives showed a positive effect on the elongation at break and toughness, which increased from 2 to 31 % and from 1 to 8 MJ/m 3, respectively. A combination of nanofiber-matrix interfacial slippage and a massive crazing effect is suggested for PLA toughening. CNF were expected to restrict the spherulite growth and therefore enhance the craze nucleation. In the third study, triacetate citrate plasticized poly lactic acid and its nanocomposites based on cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) and chitin nanocrystals (ChNC) were prepared using a co-rotating twin-screw extruder. The materials were compression molded to films using two different cooling rates. The cooling rates and the addition of nanocrystals (1 wt%) had an impact on the crystallinity as well as the optical, thermal and mechanical properties of the films. The fast cooling resulted in more amorphous materials, increased transparency and elongation to break, (approx. 300 %) when compared with slow cooling. Chitin nanocomposites were more transparent than cellulose nanocomposites; however, microscopy study showed presence of agglomerations in both materials. The mechanical properties of the plasticized PLA were improved with the addition of a small amount of nanocrystals resulting in PLA nanocomposites suitable for use in film blowing and thus packaging applications. Summing up, this thesis shows that solution mixing followed by electrospinning can be used to produce reinforced green nanocomposite fibers with random or aligned orientation with, probably, potential to be used in membranes, filters or even in medical applications. It was also shown that PLA-CNF nanocomposites can be prepared using extrusion and liquid feeding and that small amounts of CNF changed the fracture mechanism, resulting in increased toughness. In addition, the cooling rate of the plasticized PLA and its nanocomposite films was found to significantly impact the film properties.

Extrusion is a common industrial process and thus, the development of this technique for the preparation of bionanocomposites can promote the commercialization of these materials in future. In this work, nanocomposites based on polylactic acid (PLA), cellulose nanofibers (CNF), cellulose nanocrystals (CNC), and chitin nanocrystals (ChNC) with varying nanomaterial content were prepared via liquid-assisted extrusion using a plasticizer as a dispersing and processing aid. This process consists of dispersing the nanomaterial in a liquid composed of water, a plasticizer and/or a solvent, and then feeding this suspension directly into the extruder during the process. To be able to carry out this process successfully, parameters such as the amount of liquid, the liquid feeding rate or the water-to-solvent ratio, among others, should be taken in account. CNF and ChNC were produced from banana rachis waste and crustacean waste, respectively, whereas CNC were available as a commercial product. <b>Glycerol</b> <b>triacetate</b> (GTA) and triethyl citrate (TEC) were used as plasticizers, dispersing and processing aids. The effects of the liquids used during extrusion, the plasticizers and the nanomaterials in the PLA properties were studied. Furthermore, the effects of the cooling rate during the compression molding and the solid-state drawing on the properties of the PLA nanocomposites were investigated. Additionally, the effect of ChNC on the processing and properties of blown films was evaluated. The results presented in this work demonstrated that the use of water and a solvent during the liquid-assisted extrusion did not decrease the molecular weight of the PLA. It was also found that the feeding of nanomaterials in aqueous or aqueous/solvent suspension resulted in PLA micro-composite with lower mechanical properties than PLA. However, when a nanomaterial was fed together with a plasticizer, its dispersion and distribution into the PLA were progressively improved with increasing plasticizer content. The plasticized PLA nanocomposites showed improved properties compared to their respective counterpart without nanomaterials when the plasticizer content was ≥ 7. 5 wt%. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the properties of PLA can be tailored through the composition of the nanocomposite or during the processing. It was observed that the modification of PLA with only plasticizer in high amounts (20 wt%) resulted in enhanced elongation at break and toughness but it had negative effects on the thermal and mechanical properties; however, the incorporation of nanomaterials minimized these effects. The addition of a small amount of nanomaterial (1 wt%), either CNF, CNC or ChNC, to plasticized PLA resulted in enhanced mechanical properties. It was also demonstrated that the cooling rate during compression molding and the solid-state drawing significantly affected the crystallinity of the PLA nanocomposites and, thus, their final properties. The fast cooling rate during compression molding resulted in more flexible and transparent materials than when a slow cooling rate was used, and as a result, PLA films with different mechanical properties were obtained. The drawing of the PLA/CNF nanocomposite at a drawing temperature slightly above the Tg, a high draw speed and at the highest drawing ratio, resulted in the highest mechanical properties. It was also found that the increased toughness after adding CNF to the plasticized PLA or after drawing the PLA/CNF nanocomposite, was attributed to the occurrence of massive crazing effect as a result of the presence of CNF and its effect on the crystallinity and/or on the spherulite growth. Finally, 6 kg of plasticized PLA nanocomposite with 5 wt% of ChNC was prepared and used as a masterbatch to produce bio-nanocomposite blown films. The nanocomposite material showed easier processability during the film-blowing process when compared with the reference material without nanocrystals. In addition, the nanocomposite blown films exhibited higher tear and puncture strength, lower fungal activity and lower electrostatic attraction properties, which are favorable in packaging applications.   In conclusion, this thesis shows that the liquid-assisted extrusion process is an excellent approach for producing PLA nanocomposites using cellulose and chitin nanomaterials. The results indicated that the addition of these nanomaterials, together with a plasticizer and further processing, can result in PLA nanocomposites with varied properties that can be used for packing applications. It was also shown that the processing technique presented can be a step forward for the large-scale production of bionanocomposites. ...|$|E
