5000|$|Topography {{has kept}} the railway away from Flims, but the hotel {{received}} its first summer season Postbus service in 1920. The open topped charabanc, known as the [...] "Car Alpin", greatly improved <b>guest</b> <b>access.</b> For winter season work a Postbus equipped with Caterpillar tracks (US-English: Continuous track) was introduced in 1926. Within the hotel complex, additional [...] "en suite" [...] bath facilities and running water installations were added during the 1920s. In 1923, after {{nearly half a century}} as the [...] "Kur- und Seebadanstalt", the operating company changed its name to [...] "Kurhotels und Seebad AG", while the hotel complex was now called [...] "Park Hotels Waldhaus".|$|E

Fantasy of Flight <b>guest</b> <b>access</b> to the Golden Hill facility is via over-the-road trolley operated from the main parking lot in the mornings. Guests are allowed to explore the facility on their own with docents present to answer questions.

50|$|Network Admission Control (NAC) {{refers to}} Cisco's version of Network Access Control, which restricts {{access to the}} network based on {{identity}} or security posture. When a network device (switch, router, wireless access point, DHCP server, etc.) is configured for NAC, it can force user or machine authentication prior to granting access to the network. In addition, <b>guest</b> <b>access</b> can be granted to a quarantine area for remediation of any problems that may have caused authentication failure. This is enforced through an inline custom network device, changes to an existing switch or router, or a restricted DHCP class. A typical (non-free) WiFi connection {{is a form of}} NAC. The user must present some sort of credentials (or a credit card) before being granted access to the network.|$|E
5|$|Theme park guests {{may use the}} Hogwarts Express {{to travel}} between Hogsmeade and King's Cross in London, close to Diagon Alley. They can travel in either {{direction}} {{as long as the}} guest has purchased a Park-to-Park ticket, which gives <b>guests</b> <b>access</b> to both of Universal Orlando's theme parks within the same day. Two different experiences are provided depending on the destination of the train, both of which are approximately four minutes long.|$|R
50|$|The Grand Hotel {{was built}} in 1858 for Aubin Albin Vergnile, a {{financier}} {{and president of the}} Caisse Centrale de l'Industrie, {{under the direction of the}} architect Baumier. Initially the hotel had 120 bedrooms, which had been increased to 350 by 1896. The building includes two towers and a rotunda.

In 1997 after {{the founding of}} CourseInfo, version 1.0 of the [...] "Teachers Toolbox" [...] was launched including a series of named [...] "Generator" [...] tools including the coursesite generator, announcement generator, quiz generator, survey generator and other tools. Gilfus designed the features and functions and web design of the product through personal experience and instructor feedback while Cane developed the core technology of the product. Gilfus also led sales, marketing and product management for the company. Much of the company's initial communication was on educational listservs and web boards.In mid-1997, the [...] "Interactive Learning Network" [...] ILN 1.5, was released and installed at several academic institutions including Cornell University, Yale Medical School and University of Pittsburgh. The ILN was the first e-learning system of its kind to leverage and install {{on top of a}} relational database MySQL. Access control was added to provide security around course content. <b>Guest</b> <b>access</b> was provided for course shopping.In 1998 the CourseInfo product line (then the Interactive Learning Network or ILN) became the foundation for Blackboard's e-learning product line as Blacboard's CourseInfo.In April 29, 1998 the CourseInfo {{was among the first to}} implement emerging industry standards.

40|$|International audienceInternet access {{everywhere}} {{has become}} a reality today, largely thanks to the deployment of numerous WiFi hotspots. However, controlling user access to the network remains a challenge {{because of the need}} for specific hardware and the lack of software standards. Using the OpenFlow protocol, we provide a new extensible way of designing and managing <b>guest</b> <b>access</b> architectures in the Cloud. We demonstrate the feasibility of such an architecture, with little impact on existing configurations when using virtual machines and Software Defined Networks. Our results can be used to build a real life testbed to test new mutualized <b>guest</b> <b>access</b> network architecture and improve hardware interoperability...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{describes}} the web application used for analysing temperature data measured in {{a supply chain}} and calculation of the remaining shelf life. The application is used for both businesses and consumers who have various amount of data. Fluctuations in temperature of the product during storage and transportation can be reviewed {{with the help of}} the web application. The application itself allows you to use two different types of accesses or reviews for data; <b>guest</b> <b>access</b> and expanded access. <b>Guest</b> <b>access</b> is designed for consumers of those products. Expanded access is designed for users in direct contact with the cold chain and allows them a comprehensive overview of data and information. Information is automatic and ran during the analysis allowing the user to receive detailed information of any error. ...|$|E

40|$|Dartmouth's Greenpass project extends how {{public key}} {{cryptography}} {{can be used to}} secure the wireless LAN with a RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial In User Service) server that is responsible for handling authentication requests from clients (called supplicants in the 802. 1 x authentication model). This thesis describes the design and implementation of the authentication process of Greenpass, specifically what decisions are made in determining who is granted access and how a small modification of already existing protocols can be used to provide <b>guest</b> <b>access</b> in a way that better reflects how delegation of authority works in the real world...|$|E
40|$|Current {{wireless}} authentication mechanisms typically rely on inflexible shared secrets or {{a heavyweight}} public-key infrastructure with user-specific digital certificates and, as such, lack general support for environments with dynamic user bases where <b>guest</b> <b>access</b> is frequent. Simple Authentication for the Web (SAW) facilitates dynamic user {{bases in the}} context of web site logins by enabling users to authenticate to personal messaging identifiers (e. g., email addresses, IM handles, cell phone numbers). SAW, however, is ill-suited for wireless authentication because, in most cases, it is dependent on client-side Internet connectivity. Wireless Authentication using Remote Passwords (WARP) overcomes this constraint by building a hybrid protocol that combines the principles of SAW authentication with the Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol...|$|E
40|$|A nanoparticle-based {{strategy}} has been demonstrated using structurally-tailored tert-butylcalixarenes immobilized on gold nanoparticles to tune the <b>guest</b> <b>access</b> to the calixarene cone cavity for cationic recognition. This strategy exploits the interparticle charge-induced aggregation upon selective capture of metal cations into the nanoparticle-immobilized tert-butylcalixarenes, which produces calorimetric changes for the detection. A possible pathway for the binding of M(n+) into the t-BCA structure and the interparticle interaction is proposed {{for the formation of}} an electric double layer inducing the interparticle association responsible for the red-shifted surface plasmon resonance band of the nanoparticles. The value of this class of calorimetric nanoprobes will be in the area of designing advanced host-guest probes using a variety of calixarene ligands for ionic recognition in a simplistic detection format...|$|E
