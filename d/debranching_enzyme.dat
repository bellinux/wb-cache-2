40|$|The {{activities}} of {{the two types of}} starch <b>debranching</b> <b>enzymes,</b> isoamylase and pullulanase, were greatly reduced in endosperms of allelic sugary- 1 mutants of rice (Oryza sativa), with the decrease more pronounced for isoamylase than for pullulanase. However, the decrease in isoamylase activity was not related to the magnitude of the sugary phenotype (the proportion of the phytoglycogen region of the endosperm), as observed with pullulanase. In the moderately mutated line EM- 5, the pullulanase activity was markedly lower in the phytoglycogen region than in the starch region, and isoamylase activity was extremely low or completely lost in the whole endosperm tissue. These results suggest that both <b>debranching</b> <b>enzymes</b> are involved in amylopectin biosynthesis in rice endosperm. We presume that isoamylase plays a predominant role in amylopectin synthesis, but pullulanase is also essential or can compensate for the role of isoamylase {{in the construction of the}} amylopectin multiple-cluster structure. It is highly possible that isoamylase was modified in some sugary- 1 mutants such as EM- 273 and EM- 5, since it was present in significant and trace amounts, respectively, in these mutants but was apparently inactive.

40|$|This study {{tested the}} {{interchangeability}} of enzymes in starch metabolism between dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plant species. Amylopectin- a branched glucose polymer- {{is the major}} component of starch and is responsible for its semi-crystalline property. Plants synthesize starch with distinct amylopectin structures, varying between species and tissues. The structure determines starch properties, an important characteristic for cooking and nutrition, and for the industrial uses of starch. Amylopectin synthesis involves at least three enzyme classes: starch synthases, branching <b>enzymes</b> and <b>debranching</b> <b>enzymes.</b> For all three classes, several enzyme isoforms have been identified. However, {{it is not clear}} which enzyme(s) are responsible for the large diversity of amylopectin structures. Here, we tested whether the specificities of the <b>debranching</b> <b>enzymes</b> (ISA 1 and ISA 2) are major determinants of species-dependent differences in amylopectin structure by replacing the dicotyledonous Arabidopsis isoamylases (AtISA 1 and AtISA 2) with the monocotyledonous rice (Oryza sativa) isoforms. We demonstrate that the ISA 1 and ISA 2 are sufficiently well conserved between these species to form heteromultimeric chimeric Arabidopsis/rice isoamylase enzymes. Furthermore, we were able to reconstitute the endosperm-specific rice OsISA 1 homomultimeric complex in Arabidopsis isa 1 isa 2 mutants. This homomultimer was able to facilitate normal rates of starch synthesis.

However, as matter of time, the roles of other genes involved in starch biosynthesis could not be studied, eg.

Three hundred and ninety four proteins were identified including enzymes that have potential to metabolize assimilated products of extracellular xylan digestion. Identified enzymes included arabinosidases, esterases, an endoxylanase, and β-xylosidase. The presence of intracellular <b>debranching</b> <b>enzymes</b> indicated that some hemicellulosic side-chains may not be removed until oligosaccharides liberated by extracellular digestion have been assimilated by the cells.

30|$|Plant {{leaves are}} the largest organ of {{photosynthesis}} with highest photosynthetic efficiency, providing {{an important source of}} carbohydrate for developing grains. Therefore they serve as the ultimate yield-limiting factor (Slafer et al. 1990). As reported, the contribution of wheat flag leaves to grain yield is up to 41 – 43 % (Araus and Tapia 1987). However, photosynthesis is particularly sensitive to water deficit and the photosynthetic rate is negatively related to water content (Lawlor and Cornic 2002). Meanwhile, drought causes foliar stoma limitation and reduces air exchanges (Cornic 2000). In addition, metabolic repair can be suppressed by drought, causing the limitation of photosynthesis and significant reduction of carbon assimilation and utilization capacity (Reddy et al. 2004). Grain endosperm in wheat consists of about 70 % starch and 14 % proteins, which are the major determinant of yield and quality (Johansson et al. 2001; Donner and Mesdag 2000). These reserve substances are rapidly synthesized and accumulated after flowering, and this process involves lots of genes and enzymes (Cao et al. 2015; Yu et al. 2016). At least four types of enzymes, phosphorylated by other kinases in the amyloplast of higher plant endosperm, are involved in starch biosynthesis such as branching enzymes, ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase), starch synthases (SS) and <b>debranching</b> <b>enzymes</b> (DBE).|$|R

The enzymes used in the saccharification step are the amylolytic enzyme, beta-amylase (usually derived from Bacillus species) and the <b>debranching</b> <b>enzyme,</b> pullulanase (derived from Aerobacter species). These convert the dextrinised starch into simple carbohydrates (sugars) and lower molecular weight dextrins.|$|E
50|$|Here, {{glycogen}} phosphorylase cleaves the bond linking a terminal glucose residue to a glycogen branch by substitution of a phosphoryl {{group for the}} α1→4 linkage. Glucose-1-phosphate is converted to glucose-6-phosphate by the enzyme phosphoglucomutase. Glucose residues are phosphorolysed from branches of glycogen until four residues before a glucose that is branched with a α1→6 linkage. Glycogen <b>debranching</b> <b>enzyme</b> then transfers three of the remaining four glucose units {{to the end of}} another glycogen branch. This exposes the α1→6 branching point, which is hydrolysed by α1→6 glucosidase, removing the final glucose residue of the branch as a molecule of glucose and eliminating the branch. This is the only case in which a glycogen metabolite is not glucose-1-phosphate. The glucose is subsequently phosphorylated to glucose-6-phosphate by hexokinase.|$|E
50|$|Glycogen {{phosphorylase}} can act only on linear {{chains of}} glycogen (α1-4 glycosidic linkage). Its work will immediately {{come to a}} halt four residues away from α1-6 branch (which are exceedingly common in glycogen). In these situations, a <b>debranching</b> <b>enzyme</b> is necessary, which will straighten out the chain in that area. In addition, the enzyme transferase shifts a block of 3 glucosyl residues from the outer branch to the other end, and then a α1-6 glucosidase enzyme is required to break the remaining (single glucose) α1-6 residue that remains in the new linear chain. After all this is done, glycogen phosphorylase can continue. The enzyme is specific to α1-4 chains, as the molecule contains a 30-angstrom-long crevice with the same radius as the helix formed by the glycogen chain; this accommodates 4-5 glucosyl residues, but is too narrow for branches. This crevice connects the glycogen storage site to the active, catalytic site.|$|E

The expression patterns of the genes are consistent with the possibility that they all play roles in starch synthesis. Analysis of the predicted sequences of the proteins suggested that only Stisa 1 and Stisa 3 are likely to have hydrolytic activity and that there probably are differences in substrate specificity between these two isoforms. This was confirmed by the expression of each isoamylase in Escherichia coli and characterization of its activity. Partial purification of isoamylase activity from potato tubers showed that Stisa 1 and Stisa 2 are associated as a multimeric enzyme but that Stisa 3 is not associated with this enzyme complex. Our data suggest that Stisa 1 and Stisa 2 act together to debranch soluble glucan during starch synthesis. The catalytic specificity of Stisa 3 is distinct from that of the multimeric enzyme, indicating that it may play a different role in starch metabolism...|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that <b>debranching</b> <b>enzymes</b> (DBEs) are involved in the biosynthesis of amylopectin, the major constituent of starch granules. Our systematic analysis of all DBE mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana demonstrates that when any DBE activity remains, starch granules are still synthesized, albeit with altered amylopectin structure. Quadruple mutants lacking all four DBE proteins (Isoamylase 1 [ISA 1], ISA 2, and ISA 3, and Limit-Dextrinase) are devoid of starch granules and instead accumulate highly branched glucans, distinct from amylopectin and from previously described phytoglycogen. A fraction of these glucans are present as discrete, insoluble, nanometer-scale particles, but the structure and properties of this material are radically altered compared with wild-type amylopectin. Superficially, these data support the hypothesis that debranching is required for amylopectin synthesis. However, our analyses show that soluble glucans in the quadruple DBE mutant are degraded by {alpha}- and β-amylases during periods of net accumulation, giving rise to maltose and branched malto-oligosaccharides. The additional loss of the chloroplastic {alpha}-amylase AMY 3 partially reverts the phenotype of the quadruple DBE mutant, restoring starch granule biosynthesis. We propose that DBEs function in normal amylopectin synthesis by promoting amylopectin crystallization but conclude that they are not mandatory for starch granule synthesis...|$|R
