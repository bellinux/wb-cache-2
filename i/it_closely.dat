5|$|A classic {{site for}} the study of biocolonisation from founder populations that arrive from outside (allochthonous), Surtsey was {{declared}} a nature reserve in 1965, while the eruption was still in active progress. Today only a few scientists are permitted to land on Surtsey; the only way anyone else can see <b>it</b> <b>closely</b> is from a small plane. This allows the natural ecological succession for the island to proceed without outside interference. In 2008, UNESCO declared the island a World Heritage Site, in recognition of its great scientific value.|$|E
5|$|After {{intersecting}} SR163, {{also known}} as the Cabrillo Freeway, I-805 continues through suburban San Diego, where it meets SR52 in Clairemont Mesa. North of SR52, <b>it</b> <b>closely</b> parallels I-5 near La Jolla, heading northwest. Passing under the Eastgate Mall arch bridge and entering Sorrento Valley, it finally meets its north end at I-5. During the widening project which was completed in 2007, I-5 at the I-805 merge was built to be 21lanes wide. Eastbound SR56 and Carmel Mountain Road are accessible via a parallel carriageway for local traffic heading northbound from I-805; traffic from SR56 westbound can merge onto I-805 from the local bypass.|$|E
5|$|Akodon spegazzinii {{was first}} {{described}} in 1897 from Salta Province by Oldfield Thomas {{on the basis}} of a collection made in late 1896 or early 1897 by mycologist Carlos Luigi Spegazzini, after whom the species was named. Four years later, Joel Asaph Allen named Akodon tucumanensis from Tucumán Province, comparing it to various species now synonymized under Abrothrix olivaceus. Thomas named an additional species, Akodon alterus, from La Rioja Province in 1919, and considered <b>it</b> <b>closely</b> related to A.spegazzinii. A fourth species, Akodon leucolimnaeus, was described by Ángel Cabrera from Catamarca Province in 1926, but after 1932 it was associated with Akodon lactens (now Necromys lactens) as a subspecies.|$|E

5|$|In his 1981 {{monograph}} The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae), Alex George placed B. lemanniana in B.subg. Banksia {{because its}} inflorescence {{is a typical}} Banksia flower spike; in B.sect. Banksia because of its straight styles. He made it the type species of B.ser. Tetragonae, the members of which are defined by their pendulous inflorescences and tetragonal limbs. He considered <b>it</b> <b>closely</b> related to B.aculeata and B.caleyi, which are smaller, more compact, shrubs with red- or pink-tinged inflorescences.|$|E
5|$|In the {{south-east}} {{corner of}} the walls is God's House tower. This is architecturally important as {{it was one of}} the first urban buildings to be built to hold gunpowder artillery – in this respect, <b>it</b> <b>closely</b> resembles Cow Tower in Norwich. The tower was built alongside God's House Gate and is three storeys high. The gunports designed for handcannon can be seen on the outside, and the roof was designed to hold larger cannon. Adjacent to the tower is God's House Gate, a two-storey building also equipped with a gun-port.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>closely</b> resembles its relative, the Moreton Bay fig (F.macrophylla). Having similar ranges in the wild, {{they are}} often confused. The smaller leaves, shorter fruit stalks, and rusty colour of the undersides of the leaves of F.rubiginosa are the easiest {{distinguishing}} features. It is also confused with the small-leaved fig (F.obliqua), the syconia of which are smaller, measuring 4–12mm long and 4–11mm in diameter, compared with 7–17mm long and 8–17mm diameter for F. rubiginosa.|$|E

5|$|On September 9 a {{tropical}} wave moved off the African coast and moved west into the Atlantic. It started {{to become more}} organized on September 13 and the National Hurricane Center began to watch <b>it</b> <b>closely</b> for further development. Tropical Depression Seventeen formed from the wave on September 17 when it was 350miles (560km) east of Barbados. The depression strengthened further to become Tropical Storm Philippe that evening, and the official forecasts correctly indicated that Philippe would move northwards and not approach the Lesser Antilles despite climatology suggesting {{an impact on the}} islands.|$|E
5|$|Scyllarus latus {{is found}} along {{most of the}} coast of the Mediterranean Sea (one {{exception}} being the northern Adriatic Sea), and in parts of the eastern Atlantic Ocean from near Lisbon in Portugal south to Senegal, including the islands of Madeira, the Azores, the Selvagens Islands and the Cape Verde Islands. In Senegal, it occurs together with a related species Scyllarides herklotsii, which <b>it</b> <b>closely</b> resembles.|$|E
5|$|After {{examining}} the holotype in London, Hershkovitz instead placed the {{species in the}} genus Oryzomys in 1948. He remarked {{that it was an}} especially distinctive member of that genus, and hence classified it in its own subgenus Micronectomys. J. Hernández-Camacho described a second species of Micronectomys, Oryzomys (Micronectomys) borreroi, from Colombia in 1957. In 1970, Hershkovitz treated O.dimidiatus in another publication and conceded that his name Micronectomys was a nomen nudum ("naked name") because he had not explicitly mentioned characters differentiating it from other taxa in his 1948 publication. Nevertheless, he did not do anything to rectify the situation, and Micronectomys remains a nomen nudum. Hershkovitz also noted that while O.dimidiatus resembles a juvenile Nectomys in external anatomy, it is otherwise similar to the marsh rice rat (Oryzomys palustris). He accepted O.borreroi as an Oryzomys, but did not think <b>it</b> <b>closely</b> related to O.dimidiatus. Six years later, Alfred Gardner and James Patton instead suggested that O.borreroi was a Zygodontomys, and in his 1991 review of that genus Robert Voss confirmed that it is the same as Zygodontomys brunneus.|$|E

5|$|Caused {{in part by}} a drought, the Russian famine of 1921 was {{the most}} severe that the country had {{experienced}} since that of 1891, resulting in around five million deaths. The famine was exacerbated by government requisitioning, as well as the export of large quantities of Russian grain. To aid the famine victims, the US government established an American Relief Administration to distribute food; Lenin was suspicious of this aid and had <b>it</b> <b>closely</b> monitored. During the famine, Patriarch Tikhon called on Orthodox churches to sell unnecessary items to help feed the starving, an action endorsed by the government. In February 1922 Sovnarkom went further by calling on all valuables belonging to religious institutions to be forcibly appropriated and sold. Tikhon opposed the sale of items used within the Eucharist and many clergy resisted the appropriations, resulting in violence.|$|E
5|$|The {{landscape}} shows a fictive Flemish city. As in the diptych in New York, some {{buildings and}} landmarks {{can be identified}} with Jerusalem. <b>It</b> <b>closely</b> resembles {{the background of the}} Rolin panel, which has undergone much deeper attention from scholars, with a number of identifications made with structures in Jerusalem, including the Mosque of Omar, known to van Eyck through second-hand textual and visual descriptions. People and animals populate the city walls, but some are only visible under magnification in the Philadelphia painting. The lake by the city shows a boat whose shadow is reflected in the water. Reflective water surfaces were another typical Eyckian innovation, one he seems to have mastered early, evidenced by the water scenes in the Turin-Milan Hours, and which requires a considerable degree of artistry. Plants consist of tiny foreground flowers, larger mid-ground grasses and background bushes and trees. The small carpet of white flowers in the foreground is reminiscent of those in the Ghent Altarpieces central panel; behind Francis are dwarf palms.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{colouration}} of Caloboletus calopus, {{with its}} pale cap, yellow pores and red stipe, is not shared {{with any other}} bolete. Large pale specimens resemble Suillellus luridus, and the cap of Rubroboletus satanas is a similar colour but this species has red pores. Fruit bodies in poor condition could be confused with Xerocomellus chrysenteron but the stipes of this species are not reticulated. Edible species such as B.edulis lack a red stipe. <b>It</b> <b>closely</b> resembles the similarly inedible C.radicans, which lacks the redness on the stipe. Like C.calopus, the western North American species C.rubripes also has a bitter taste, similarly coloured cap, and yellowish pores that bruise blue, but it lacks reticulation on its reddish stipe. Found in northwestern North America, B.coniferarum lacks reddish or pinkish colouration in its yellow reticulate stipe, and has a darker, olive-grey to deep brown cap.|$|E

5|$|From here, {{the road}} {{continues}} southwesterly and passes {{to the west}} of Jones Run Parking, where a trail leads to Jones Run Falls, before heading east of Blackrock Summit Parking. Skyline Drive winds south past Blackrock and turns to the west. The roadway heads north before a hairpin turn to the south at Blackrock Gap, where <b>it</b> <b>closely</b> follows the border between Augusta and Albemarle counties. Further south, Skyline Drive passes the Wildcat Ridge Parking Area before coming to the Crimora Lake Overlook that faces to the west. The roadway continues along past the Turk Mountain Overlook {{on the west side of}} the road prior to reaching the Turk Gap Parking to the east. The drive winding south through Jarman Gap before it curves southwest and continues to the west-facing Calf Mountain Overlook, where it turns to the southeast. Skyline Drive passes through Beagle Gap, winding to the south. The roadway heads to the southwest and west to the north-facing McCormick Gap Overlook, where it curves back to the southwest. The drive continues along and passes through the Rockfish Gap Entrance Station, where a ranger station is located. Past here, the road heads south and comes to a bridge over I-64 before it reaches an interchange with US 250 that provides access to I-64 in Rockfish Gap in Augusta County, which is located east of Waynesboro and west of Charlottesville. At this interchange, Skyline Drive ends and the road continues to the south as the Blue Ridge Parkway.|$|E
5|$|NY5 {{enters the}} city of Utica on a {{concurrency}} with NY12 heading in a northeast direction. It shortly picks up NY8, and all three cross the city together. NY5 also intersects with the terminus of NY840 at this point. Just south of the New York State Thruway, I-790 begins as a short expressway, also including NY5, NY8, and NY12. After crossing out of the city, they meet the Thruway, with NY8 and12 continuing northeast, while I-790 and NY5 turn to the east-south-east, picking up the tail-end of NY49. These three, still as an expressway, straddle {{each side of the}} Thruway for a short way, with I-790 technically ending at the ramps for I-90. NY5 continues {{to the end of the}} expressway, only a few hundred feet later, dropping to Leland Avenue. A few hundred feet to the north of the Thruway, NY5 turns eastward again to continue down Herkimer Road. <b>It</b> <b>closely</b> parallels the Thruway all the way to Herkimer, where NY5 moves slightly northward through the center of the village, becoming State Street, while I-90 crosses the Erie Canal and goes south for a short distance. There is a short concurrency with NY28 in the village.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{minutes after}} the French opened fire Goliath, {{ignoring}} fire from the fort to starboard and from Guerrier to port, most of which was too high to trouble the ship, crossed {{the head of the}} French line. Captain Thomas Foley had noticed as he approached that there was an unexpected gap between Guerrier and the shallow water of the shoal. On his own initiative, Foley decided to exploit this tactical error and changed his angle of approach to sail through the gap. As the bow of Guerrier came within range, Goliath opened fire, inflicting severe damage with a double-shotted raking broadside as the British ship turned to port and passed down the unprepared port side of Guerrier. Foley's Royal Marines and a company of Austrian grenadiers joined the attack, firing their muskets. Foley had intended to anchor alongside the French ship and engage <b>it</b> <b>closely,</b> but his anchor took too long to descend and his ship passed Guerrier entirely. Goliath eventually stopped close to the bow of Conquérant, opening fire on the new opponent and using the unengaged starboard guns to exchange occasional shots with the frigate Sérieuse and bomb vessel Hercule, which were anchored inshore of the battle line.|$|E
