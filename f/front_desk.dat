The finial {{lay at the}} top of a Napoleonic flag, which they attempted to unscrew from the wall, but failed. Manet's Chez Tortoni was also stolen from its location in the Blue Room. Motion detector records show that the only footsteps detected in the Blue Room that night were at 12:27a.m. and again at 12:53a.m. These times match to when Abath said he passed through on patrol.

As any golfer would know, it meant, when hitting a short approach shot, get it close enough to the pin to make the next putt. [...] Now for the humorous part of that admonition. We had played Purdue in Lafayette on a Thursday and were to play Illinois on Friday. The Professor was to call us at 4:30a.m. to catch a 5:30 train for Urbana. Well, he got confused on our room number and awakened a man who called the <b>front</b> <b>desk</b> and told the night clerk that there must be some nut calling at 4:30a.m. and shouting, 'Up and out in two boys!'
