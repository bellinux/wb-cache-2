In these guidelines future sustainable management of the built environment is directed towards rehabilitation of the present condition. These guidelines are integrated in Slovenian normative and evaluation documents. However, since these documents, especially the normative ones, are not mutually coherent and do not have necessary back-up in development plans, guidelines, by-laws, models and different stimulation or restrictions, contemporary planning of the built environment, doesn’t manifest itself in our space.

40|$|The Land Reform {{programme}} in Zimbabwe {{has been}} a major area of international discussion for almost five years now; mainly due to the hitherto unprecedented approach taken by the government of Zimbabwe to address this very emotive issue. From the world’s marginalized communities there {{has been a}} lot of admiration for such a bold move, while there has been condemnation from other sections of the international community who sympathise with those perceived to be at the losing end of this exercise. This paper takes a critical look at the issues surrounding the land reform programme. It investigates the historical background to land ownership in Zimbabwe before and after independence from colonial rule. The paper will also look at the Zimbabwe government’s Land policy since 1980 and what has influenced same. The legal framework under which this exercise is proceeding will also come under scrutiny. The government policy will then be evaluated against the Global Plan of Action of the <b>Habitat</b> II <b>agenda,</b> to which the government is a signatory. Finally the paper will question the actual implementation of the land reform programme, with the aim of drawing lessons from the Zimbabwean experience...|$|R

40|$|The main {{trend in}} {{developmental}} theories nowadays is the Sustainable Development the-ory that sets environmental protection as a pre-requisite for economical growth. This approach {{was established in}} the conference held in Rio, Brazil in 1992. Thus, after the Conference an international framework was created (AGENDA 21, Green Bible, <b>Habitat</b> II, <b>Agenda,</b> Urban Agenda) within which actions, having as com-mon characteristic the developmental model of sustainable growth, are coordinated. Energy production and its use are considered responsible for the largest part of climate change. Consequently, energy policy becomes an important factor {{for the protection of the}} en-vironment. According to the principles of sus-tainable growth this policy should have not only economic but also socio-ecological aims and re-quires actions "from beneath", an element giv-ing local authorities an important role in energy policy.

40|$|The {{arguments}} in Nigeria {{over whether the}} urban or the rural areas should be given greater priority in national development appear somewhat misplaced and unhelpful because the {{urban and rural areas}} are mutually interdependent, with many complex links and interactions between them, and the constant movements of people, goods, money, ideas and information from one to the other.

It focuses on the promotion of small and intermediate urban centres as an appropriate middle course which combines the advantages of urban as well as rural approaches to development, but without the disadvantages of large population concentrations in a few metropolitan areas, or of the wide dispersal of investments and scarce resources in scattered villages too small to support basic services.

Based on recent work done in the reinterpretation of South Africa’s National Building Regulations in SANS 10400, the Application of the National Building Regulations, it suggests how performance parameters relating to fire safety, sanitation system, moisture penetration and structural safety, serviceability and durability can be established to reflect societal expectations in a developing country, in a manner which supports sustainable development objectives. The paper also outlines the performance based approach which has recently been adopted by the National Department of Housing to address the conservation of fuel and power by addressing thermal comfort and suggests how the conservation of natural resources and the provision of employment could be addressed though performance based standards linked to government mass housing projects.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade the {{relationship}} between urban governance and urban development has been an area of growing academic and theoretical discussions. To improve urban living conditions, multilateral agencies within the United Nations {{have been at the}} forefront in integrating a ‘good governance’ agenda, including participation and decentralisation into a wide range of policies and urban development programmes. The principles underpinning these programmes find their origin in documents such as the <b>Habitat</b> <b>Agenda</b> and the Millennium Development Goals. In many of such programmes, models developed for African and Latin American cities have been adapted for implementation in cities in other regions of the global South. This article questions the extent to which such UDPs, with specific images and structures of governance in mind, are relevant to other urban realities. The central question is whether the urban issues that are considered urgent at the global level resonate with those acknowledged as urgent at the regional and national levels. Focussing on the CARICOM Caribbean, for this comparison, an international urban agenda with a Caribbean translation is developed, largely defined by UN programmes that have been implemented in the region. This international agenda is juxtaposed with a regionally defined Caribbean agenda of critical urban issues. We argue that while both policy agendas contain similarities, UDPs implemented by international agencies are not always relevant and useful. Specifically, we review the methodologies of implementation introduced in UN programmes, aimed at resource efficiency and sustainable results through a ‘good governance’ approach, which focuses on openness and transparency, inclusion, integrity and accountability through decentralisation and participation. From our preliminary analysis of local perceptions and experiences with UDPs, we argue that these approaches have not been suitably adapted to Caribbean realities...|$|E
40|$|This seminar {{report is}} about the Sinpa programme. Therefore a brief {{explanation}} of the objectives and project history is provided in this chapter to serve as background information for what is to follow. Objectives of the SINPA programme The overall goal of the SINPA programme is to help implement National Plans of Action and the <b>Habitat</b> <b>Agenda</b> by building sustainable local capacity for effective planning and management of urban development. More concretely, the programme aims to assist local government and its partners in capacity building for action in the broad areas of housing, local environmental management and participative planning processes and partnerships relating to these subjects. It especially focuses on the challenges of improving access to services and better environment for the urban poor, with particular regard to gender issues. The broad objectives of the programme are: • to stimulate the development of local capacity building strategies; • to stimulate selected local and national capacity building institutions to become more responsive to needs and to enhance quality of performance; • to stimulate urban stakeholders to learn from relevant past and ongoing experience with implementing urban development policy and projects; • to improve understanding and communication of experience relevant to needs of city development in the linked areas of housing, environmental management, participative planning and partnerships. SINPA aims to achieve these objectives by helping to bring local development partners and capacity building institutions together so as to improve capacity {{in a manner that}} will be sustainable locally. The programme is structured in a core programme, which provides co-ordination, information inputs, linkage and dissemination, and three country programmes that are developed locally in response to local issues.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Town and Regional Planning)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, Cape Town, 2006 The {{research}} {{focuses on}} urbanising communities in the peri-urban areas of the Tamale Metropolitan Area (TAMA) of Ghana and {{the inability of the}} urban authorities to provide adequate basic infrastructure services. Using a mix of qualitative and quantitative research approaches, the author observed that the development planning paradigms practiced over the years placed urban planning and service delivery in a centralised paradigm which cannot respond adequately to the increasing pressures of urbanisation, nor offer opportunities for the involvement of communities due to this top-down planning approache. The research in fact identified that the communities, through their own initiatives have planned and executed service projects to improve their lives in some respects where the TAMA has failed. The communities have achieved this due to their spirit of social solidarity, self-help and communalism built around their traditional chiefs, which incorporates some of the principles of Local Agenda 21. The TAMA sees this development as an opportunity to henceforth forge collaboration and partnerships with the traditional authorities for improved service delivery in the urbanising communities. This represents innovative urban planning and management approaches, which in the context of low-income urban communities, includes participatory planning and service delivery. These innovative approaches have been initiated in the <b>Habitat</b> <b>Agenda</b> emanating from the UN Conference on Human Settlements in 1996. The study advocates the concept of sustainable development and Agenda 21, as a working model which presents a participatory and integrative process for local authorities and communities to work towards urban improvements. The Local Agenda 21 planning approach, it is argued, will integrate and strengthen the already existing local community initiatives and provide a basis for partnerships and improved service delivery.

40|$|M. Sc. The {{social and}} {{environmental}} effects of inequitable development programmes inherited by South Africa’s new dispensation are aggravated by a substantial housing backlog. Tenure security and slow land release for development has motivated land invasions {{and the development of}} informal settlements. Subsequent environmental degradation in affected areas is mainly {{due to the lack of}} basic infrastructure and services including energy supply, water, sanitation, and waste management facilities. The Housing Act of 1997 has provided the means for developing housing delivery and township upgrade programmes aimed at addressing such problems. In light of South Africa’s Constitution (1996), the National Environmental Management Act (1998) and the <b>Habitat</b> <b>Agenda</b> (1996), the importance of environmentally sensitive and sustainable housing developments has been highlighted. However, socio-political pressure to address the housing backlog may demand a compromise in sustainability criteria over the long term, in order to achieve the shorter-term transformation targets. Within the context of South Africa’s transformation objectives, a question has developed about the extent to which low-cost townships are meeting sustainability criteria. This dissertation contributes towards answering the above question; three housing projects in Gauteng were selected and reviewed. For each project, the ecological risks, social sensitivity, economic stability, and available technology were analysed. The analysis indicated that in all three cases, the projects did not meet all defined sustainability criteria, concluding that under current conditions they are unlikely to be sustainable over the long-term. Factors that influenced the projects’ sustainability potential included the geographical location of each project, compliance with landuse development objectives, the township approval process, views of interested and affected parties, ecological sensitivity, and availability of resources and infrastructure. In order to improve housing delivery, the study further concluded that the process for housing and service provision should be more efficient, low-cost developments should be adequately addressed in landuse development strategies, improved communication between role-players and stakeholders including government departments is required, and alternative and affordable technologies should be considered, with the associated training and awareness for sustainable environmental management...|$|E
40|$|According {{to current}} predictions, the {{beginning}} of the next century will herald a shift to a predominantly urban world. For the first time ever, more than half the global population will be residing in urban areas, a large proportion of which will be in developing countries (UN, 1995). This `fact ' (see Satterthwaite, 1995; UNCHS, 1996, on the need for caution with such predictions) has been the underlying premise of the second United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ± Habitat II (the `City Summit'), held in Istanbul in June 1996. However, the sine qua non for the conference was the recognition that, while some progress has been made (Okpala, 1996), socioeconomic conditions in cities have failed to improve substantially since the first such conference was held in Vancouver in 1976. Indeed, in some cases, conditions have deteriorated, especially in terms of poverty, employment, access to infrastructure and health risks (Satterthwaite, 1995; Environment and Urbanization, 1996; UNCHS, 1996). since it is now recognized that urban growth is inevitable (McGee, 1994), Habitat II was lauded as an international forum for formulating appropriate strategies for managing cities. While accepting the limitations of such conferences in general, and of Habitat II in particular (see BerghaÈll, 1995; Korten, 1996, Okpala, 1996), the heightened profile afforded urban issues in the last year makes it apposite to devote this year's report to research on urbanization and its corollaries. While it is impossible here to provide a comprehensive account of all the themes included in the <b>Habitat</b> <b>agenda</b> (see UN, 1995), I want to consider a number of issues reflected in recent research on urbanization in relation to the broad goal of the conference: sustainable human settlement in an urbanizing world.

40|$|This is {{my final}} thesis in {{landscape}} planing at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU). I discuss how the countryside should be planned, with a sustainable perspective. In the study I examine four important conditions for planning. The countryside is often defined by {{what it is}} not which {{makes it difficult to}} describe in general terms. The definition of the term countryside in this study is taken from the National Rural Development Agency (Glesbygdsverket). The conclusion is: Planners and scientists should have an understanding for the complexity of the countryside; otherwise there is a risk of losing the characteristics of the country. The legislation, goals and conventions which {{have an impact on the}} Swedish countryside are both national and international. To find out how the settlement development is dealt with, I have studied the Swedish building legislations (among others, plan- och bygglagen and miljöbalken). Similar to the difficulties on finding a suitable definition for the term countryside, it is complex to define the term sustainable development. It can mean different things for different people. The centre of interest is how planners can work for better social sustainable development in the countryside. This is not as widely discussed in Sweden, as economical or ecological sustainability. Planners can create conditions for better social sustainability in the countryside. The <b>Habitat</b> <b>Agenda</b> state the UN goals for sustainable development and it is also fundamental for the Swedish work on sustainable town and country planning. I have also examined who inhabits the countryside. The largest group moving to the Swedish country is it the working class, mostly young families or middle aged couples. I present these facts because planners need to know who they are planning for. To get a broader perspective on countryside planning, I counducted interviews with people working with different parts of planning. They have all different perspectives on sustainable countryside planning which gives my study a broader wider view of the subject. I met both scientists and planners from two different municipalities. The theoretical discussion and the interviews resulted in guidelines for sustainable planning in the countryside. These guidelines are concretized with examples applied to Funbo, an area with rural housing outside Uppsala...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: &# 57357; Poverty, the {{increasing}} urbanisation {{of poverty and}} the environmental degradation are major problems facing the actual world. This is reflected in international conferences and agendas, such as Local Agenda 21. This agenda is responding to the current problems by promoting sustainable development through local action and by using participatory methods. Our major concern is {{to reflect on the}} impact of the Local Agenda 21 on the reduction of poverty in a Third World context. In a first approach, we will reflect on poverty and concentrate in particular on the growing dimension of urban poverty. Because of this evolution, the international institutions are more and more concerned about urban poverty. For instance, the United Nations decided to give priority to a sustainable urbanisation, which is reflected in the UN Agendas: Local Agenda 21 and the <b>Habitat</b> <b>Agenda.</b> In a second approach, we consider the Local Agenda 21 as an interesting framework to come to sustainable development and poverty reduction. Even so, we have some restrictions concerning the possibility to apply all its principles in a developing world context. As observations demonstrate, Local Agenda 21 activities are less presented in the developing world than elsewhere, {{due to the fact that}} Local Agenda 21 is often perceived as an environmental agenda and rather one for the developed countries. This is reinforced by a lack of financial means, information and expertise. By looking at the wide range of obstacles facing the development of a Local Agenda 21 in Third World countries, one can say that in many cases the international agendas are excellent theoretical instruments, but by trying to use them in Third World contexts there is often a huge gap between what is ideally prescribed and what is possible in practice. In this paper, we will give the example of the Democratic Republic of Congo, where in a situation of economic regression and an almost absence of the State, a Local Agenda 21 is a very difficult and hard to reach objective. However, interventions are possible, even the ones somehow inspired by the principles of Local Agenda 21, such as the Social Urban Fund in Kinshasa. It has to be said that if there are some LA 21 activities in the developing countries, the main preoccupation will be economic development as a means to realise poverty alleviation, whereas LA 21 prescribes sustainable development with environmental concerns at the front page. However, by reflecting on these apparently opposite priorities, we came to the conclusion that poverty concerns and environmental protection are complementary with the former not excluding the latter and both contributing to sustainable development...|$|E
40|$|The {{theory of}} {{sustainable}} development has received worldwide acceptance, and is characterised by the protection of environmental quality, social justice and economic development to ensure a {{quality of life for}} future generations. The concepts {{of sustainable development}} have transcended to all aspects of society, including the built environment through the <b>Habitat</b> <b>Agenda</b> and building sustainability rating tools. The thesis investigates the implications of sustainable development on how it relates to the building construction industry in South Africa. The study sought to evaluate the extent of consideration and motivation for the incorporation of sustainability criteria in building design, using the case of the South African Institute for Aquatic Biodiversity wet collection facility in Grahamstown. The goal of the thesis was achieved by evaluating sustainability considerations and barriers to adoption of sustainability criteria {{in the design of the}} SAlAB building, the rating of the building against the LEED ™ criteria, and evaluation of the applicability of the LEED ™ in the South African context. The importance of the research emanates from the fact that, despite the proliferation of sustainable development and sustainability rating tools in the world, there is no widely used building sustainability rating tool in South Africa, even though the country is industrialising with a very active built environment. The study therefore contributes to the body of knowledge necessary for the implementation of a building rating tool in the country, through an understanding of barriers to implementation. The research method used in the study was a case study with the intention of obtaining the design professional's considerations and challenges in the context of designing the SAIAB building. The case study used multiple data collection methods, with primary information obtained from interviews of professionals involved in the design of the building, whilst additional information was from analysis of technical drawings and review of literature on the subject. The findings of the research showed that there is an understanding of sustainability and consideration in the building industry even though there is no targeted intent to meet sustainability goals. The barriers to building sustainability were identified as lack of regulation, incentives, access to land, awareness, availability of professional codes and standards, economic costs and capacity. These barriers translated into a relatively low score, a silver rating for the SAlAB building when using the LEEDTM rating system. The implications of the findings suggests a need for the development of a comprehensive building sustainability rating tool suited for the South African context, with performance standards and a technical manual to support it. This should however be done in an environment where sustainability goals are supported by regulation and incentives have been developed...|$|E
40|$|The {{creation}} of sustainable cities {{is believed to}} solve all our urban problems, whether the problems are environmentally, socially or economically. ‘Sustainable cities’ have gained widespread scientific and political consensus, and organisations such as the United Nations, the European Union, NGOs and other political agencies have worked out concepts and plans for {{the development and implementation}} of it. These plans are manifested in reports and other policy documents that address decision-makers and the general public to follow suggestions for action. Central features in these plans are how sustainable cities are to be understood, what sort of problems cities face and how to cope with these. In particularly, city planning and technology have a crucial role to play in the achievement of sustainable cities. This thesis seeks to investigate whether the idea and the conceptualisation of the sustainable city is presented different by different agencies. Here, why similarities and differences exist are to be explained and accounted for. Furthermore, a special focus is put upon how city planning and technology are to solve urban problems, and whether these solutions and the idea of the sustainable city vary between different documents represented by agencies on different geographic scales. In order to address the scale issue, three documents are selected for closer investigation: the <b>Habitat</b> <b>Agenda</b> 2 of the United nations, the Sustainable Cities Report of the European Union, and Creating a Sustainable London, written by London Sustainable Trust. Analysing the sustainable city as represented by different agencies pose questions with regard to the method that is to be applied. The method applied in this thesis, is a discourse analysis of these documents within the framework of actor-network theory. According to this theory, texts (actants) can make it possible for the authors (actors) to achieve power. Furthermore, the texts can function as instruments to build up and stabilise networks in order to strengthen and stabilise theories and ideas. It is argued that the idea of the sustainable city is presented in such a way that it is impossible to resist. This is made possible by work of the authors who mobilise scientific articles, political conferences and other entities to support their claims. Furthermore, the ‘sustainable city’ functions a symbolic umbrella; hence actors with often contradicting interests can support the idea. The ‘sustainable city’ thus becomes an adaptive concept that is used by many actors, on different geographic scales. These scales are also produced and reproduced by the work done by actors in heterogeneous networks. For city planning, it is found that empowerment, bottom-up and participatory planning are emphasised together with the importance of experts and scientific planners, who are to manage the urban environment. Here we see that modern and post-modern concepts on planning and development are used in chorus. As for technology, we face a technological paradox: the authors of the document point out sustainable technologies as main instruments of creating sustainable cities while at the same time identifying environmentally adverse technologies as the main cause of unsustainable cities...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to define trends of housing policy in Poland and Warsaw in particular, in relation to metropolitan strategies directed towards the concept of sustainability. The comparison between the country of the ex-bloc soviet and states of Western Europe is used to define the level of cohesion in the European sector of housing, of territorial management and to define the similarities and differences relating to issues that concern the new residential urbanization and management of the existing housing stock among the countries of East and West, in the context of European policies more uniform and effective. In addition, through an analysis of four documents (Agenda 21, Kyoto Protocol, <b>Habitat</b> <b>Agenda,</b> the Leipzig Charter on Sustainable Cities) concerning sustainable urban development and housing, which could be defined as the supranational level (macro), the study as aim to define their application at the local level (micro). The study of individual local cases took place for {{in order to understand the}} position of Poland in relation to trends and patterns of urban development and housing policies in Western Europe. The key to reading and translation of documents at the macro level take place through the establishment of three pillars: housing policies (social housing, energy conservation, urban renewal), the relationship between the public and private sectors (public-private partnerships, mixed enterprise companies, management of urban transformations, incentive to the local economy) and urban development strategies (government of the territory and the concept of sustainability). With these three lines were "scanned" both the local tools of urban planning and national legislation (this way take place the translation of documentation (macro) in the meso level. The background research is represented by the theories and practices of urban development, as well as by analysis of housing policies and concepts related to housing, which have developed in the modern Europe. These theories, even if often utopian, may explain some of the choices of urban development of today or make clear the difference of residential growth trends between the past and present. The garden cities (of tomorrow) of Howard and the working-class neighbourhoods of Bruno Taut, or general issues of inhabiting elaborated by the Modern Movement, which involved the whole of Europe in the early decades of the twentieth century, they are models that have guided the construction of residential neighbourhoods along the twentieth century. The application of the lecorbusian "high ideals" through the use of prefabrication after the Second World War is a very interesting aspect of the development of housing policies, which aimed above all to economization and speed in the implementation of operations under the pressure of migration and economic recovery after the war. It was essential also for research to analyze the social changes of life style, which have crossing Europe from XX century; starting from the Engels’s housing question and the opposing concepts of community and society elaborated by Ferdinand Tönnies in 1887, ending with reflections on the “corrosion of character” of the flexible man of Richard Sennett and with the importance of the community of Zygmunt Bauman (2001). In this context, for the research it was fundamentally focus the attention on the dynamics of a European society that is changing, in which the problems of housing and construction in the suburbs represent a fundamental policy today. Suburbs, which contain a combination of past trends and ideas for the future, by which we measure ourselves today. Ascolt...|$|E
