40|$|Abstract—Face {{detection}} and recognition are key components in multiple camera-based devices and applications. Smart glasses are {{a type of}} optical head mounted displays that integrate first-person cameras and hands free displays with immediate access to processing power able to analyze first person images in real time with <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> <b>operation.</b> In this context, we have constructed an application prototype that detects and recognizes faces in real-time, and runs independently on the device. We provide {{a description of the}} embedded implementation at a system-level where we highlight the application development challenges and trade-offs that need to be dealt with battery powered wearable devices. The implementation includes a parallel pipeline that reduces the latencies of the application. Index Terms—Smart glass, face detection, face recognition I...|$|E

A decisive role is assigned to abstraction, allowing to locate graphic representations at the threshold between the projection of a structural model and the notation of an imagined model. A graphic study based on the design drawings created by the architecture office OMA/Rem Koolhaas are applied here as an example in order to describe and investigate this interface. In the process the drawings are manipulatedin a hybrid procedure consisting of manoeuvres determined by rules on one <b>hand</b> and <b>free</b> <b>operations</b> on the other.

40|$|Building upon work by Matsumoto, we {{show that}} the quantum {{relative}} entropy with full-rank second argument is determined by four simple axioms: i) Continuity in the first argument, ii) {{the validity of the}} data-processing inequality, iii) additivity under tensor products, and iv) super-additivity. This observation has immediate implications for quantum thermodynamics, which we discuss. Specifically, we demonstrate that, under reasonable restrictions, the free energy is singled out as a measure of athermality. In particular, we consider an extended class of Gibbs-preserving maps as <b>free</b> <b>operations</b> in a resource-theoretic framework, in which a catalyst is allowed to build up correlations with the system at <b>hand.</b> The <b>free</b> energy is the only extensive and continuous function that is monotonic under such <b>free</b> <b>operations.</b> Comment: 7 page...|$|R
40|$|Non-invasive {{steady-state}} visual {{evoked potential}} (SSVEP) based brain-computer interface (BCI) systems offer high bandwidth compared to other BCI types and require only minimal calibration and training. Virtual reality (VR) has been already validated as effective, safe, affordable and motivating feedback modality for BCI experiments. Augmented reality (AR) enhances the physical world by superimposing informative, context sensitive, computer generated content. In the context of BCI, AR {{can be used as}} a friendlier and more intuitive real-world user interface, thereby facilitating a more seamless and goal directed interaction. This can improve practicality and usability of BCI systems and may help to compensate for their low bandwidth. In this feasibility study, three healthy participants had to finish a complex navigation task in immersive VR and AR conditions using an online SSVEP BCI. Two out of three subjects were successful in all conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first work to present an SSVEP BCI that operates using target stimuli integrated in immersive VR and AR (head-mounted display and camera). This research direction can benefit patients by introducing more intuitive and effective real-world interaction (e. g. smart home control). It may also be relevant for user groups that require or benefit from <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> <b>operation</b> (e. g. due to temporary situational disability).

Annelies Labaere 1, Jan Vanderwegen 2, Frans Debruyne 1 1 Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, University Hospitals Leuven, Belgium 2 Antwerp University Hospital, Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Antwerp, Belgium Annelies. Labaere@uz. kuleuven. ac. be Objectives: The {{objective of this}} study was to make a qualitative comparison between tracheo-esophageal speech with manual stoma occlusion and <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> tracheo-esophageal speech with the Provox FreeHands device. Patients/Materials and Methods: Both Manual and handsfree tracheo-esophageal speech were compared in 13 patients who were regular users of Provox Freehands for at least four months. Evaluation of speech material consisted of objective analysis using the KayPentax CSL, perceptual ratings by a group of experienced listeners and patients own perceptual judgment. In addition, data concerning user-friendliness, additional values and inconveniences of the FreeHands device were gathered using questionnaires. The Voice Handicap Index (VHI) was used to evaluate the relation between voice related QOL and method of stoma occlusion. Therefore a control group of TE-speakers who did not use <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> speech, was selected. Results: Objective analysis revealed significant differences (p< 0. 05) for parameters fluency (i. e. the number of syllables produced on one intake of breath) and maximal phonation time, to the detriment of <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> speech. There were no significant differences found for the dynamic characteristics Perceptual judgements of running speech were rated higher in the manual occlusion condition for most patients, but there were interrater differences. Subjective impressions showed that the majority of patients preferred <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> speech to manual stoma occlusion, noticably for voice quality, fatigability, attractivity and feelings of self-confidence. Major inconveniences of <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> speech were a significantly decreased duration of sticker adhesion, the occurrence of disturbing noises and the need for continued effort. The VHI scores were significantly higher in the group of <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> speakers compared to the control group. Conclusions: This clinical study showed that in selected patients the Provox FreeHands shows important subjective benefits. Improvements however are necessary to make the device a useful rehabilitation device for a larger group of laryngectomized patients.

40|$|In Victoria, <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> wash <b>hand</b> basins in food {{preparation}} areas were a regulatory requirement introduced under the 1984 Health (Eating House and Food Premises) Regulations. The food safety standards introduced in January 2001 replace existing state, territory {{and local government}} food hygiene regulations {{and the provision of}} a <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> wash <b>hand</b> basin is no longer prescribed (Australia and New Zealand Food Authority 2001). The aim of the pilot study was to investigate the hypothesis that there is no difference between the effectiveness of <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> wash <b>hand</b> basins and manual tap operated basins in reducing microbial flora on hands. Thirteen premises with manual hand basins and a comparison random sample of 19 premises with <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> basins were selected from the City of Yarra in Melbourne, Australia. Data collection involved an Environmental Health Officer visiting the premises, conducting a survey and swabbing the food handler’s hands prior to and post washing. The impact of variables, including the temperature of water supplied to the wash hand basin, number of food handling employees, types of food handled, time the sample was taken and approximate number of meals sold per hour, were also investigated. The results indicated that the mean percentage {{reduction in the number of}} colonies compared for the manual and <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> <b>hand</b> basins showed no significant difference (Manual mean = 58 %, <b>Hands</b> <b>free</b> mean = 79 %, p = 0. 163). Overall, there was large variability in pre and post microbial counts for both basins and considerable variability in the temperature of water to wash hand basins. No clear association, however, was found between the number of employees, temperature of wash hand basin, meals served or use of either facility, with the percentage reduction in the microbial load. The pilot study has indicated that there is no difference between the use of either a manual or <b>hands</b> <b>free</b> wash <b>hand</b> basin for a small group of food retailers. Consideration should be given to a range of factors which might have impacted on this study, including frequency of hand washing, types of foods handled, length of mechanical wash, and number of manual wash hand basins available for the study. Education regarding the need to maintain the temperature of the wash hand basin water between 22 - 40 °C should also be investigated among food retailers as well as strategies for the correct washing of hands...|$|R
