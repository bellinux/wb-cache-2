40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} novel multifold finite-ground-width {{coplanar}} waveguide (CPW) 4 resonator filter {{that has the}} capability of realizing attenuation poles by cross coupling of nonadjacent resonators. The newly proposed multifold structures not only greatly shrink {{the length of a}} resonator, but also provide a convenient way to implement cross coupling in a filter. The proposed multifold finite-ground-width CPW resonators can have much stronger coupling than that of spiraling and meandering layouts, and any number of folds is possible. Two combline filters are designed and measured with twofold and threefold 4 finite-ground-width CPW resonators. A trisection and a quadruplet generalized Chebyshev <b>filter</b> formed by <b>cross</b> cou-plings between nonadjacent resonators have been implemented by modifying the layout of the resonator. These filters are smaller in size and have the capability of controlling attenuation poles.

40|$|Multimodal Medical Image fusion is a {{prominent}} area of interest. Medical image fusion {{is the process}} of combining images from different modalities. It improves imaging quality and reduces the redundant information. The main aim of Medical Image fusion is in having better quality of fused image for the diagnostic purposes. Image fusion improves capability and reliability of images. In medical background, sharpness of fused image is the basic criteria of quality. In this paper, quality of fused image can be enhanced by using combination of Butterworth High Pass <b>filter</b> and <b>Cross</b> Bilateral <b>filter.</b> <b>Cross</b> bilateral <b>filter</b> is a nonlinear filter, which takes both range domain and spatial domain filtering into account. It is an edge preserving filter, which fuse images by taking weighted average of source image pixels.

Here we analyze images taken under calibration programs CAL 9671 and CAL 10742 to measure the wavelength calibration of the ACS ramp filters by observing standard stars with the ramp <b>filters</b> <b>crossed</b> with the ACS G 800 L grism. We find that the tested HRC ramp filters are relatively well centered on the requested wavelengths. A number of the WFC filters, however, display significant offsets from the desired central wavelength. While the WFC direct images show large image offsets (wedges) due to the <b>crossed</b> <b>filters,</b> we have attempted to remove these offsets. Our results suggest we have reduced these offsets to one pixel or less both in images taken with the ramps <b>crossed</b> with wideband <b>filters</b> and in the spatial direction of images taken with the ramps crossed with the grism. Offsets in the spectral direction of the grism images cannot be distinguished from a wavelength miscalibration. Data taken of line emission from an astrophysical source through the FR 782 N filter and compared to ground-based imaging suggest that this filter is well calibrated, {{in contrast to the}} result of the <b>crossed</b> <b>filter</b> observations reported here.

B 13 expressing the green fluorescent protein as an identification marker were used as recipients in <b>filter</b> <b>crosses.</b> Transconjugants selected on agar plates containing 3 -chlorobenzoate as the sole carbon source {{and one of the}} antibiotics tetracycline, streptomycin or spectinomycin, respectively, arose at frequencies in the range of 10 "-" 5 to 10 "-" 8 per recipient. A total of 12 distinct plasmids, designated pB 1 to pB 12, was identified. Their sizes ranged between 41 to 69 kb and they conferred various antibiotic resistance patterns to their hosts. Two of these plasmids, pB 10 and pB 11, also mediated resistance to inorganic mercurcy. Seven of these 12 plasmids were identified as broad host range plasmids displaying extremely high transfer frequencies in <b>filter</b> <b>crosses</b> ranging from 10 "-" 1 to 10 "-" 2 per recipient cell. Ten of the 12 plasmids belonged to the IncP incompatibility group, according to replicon typing using IncP group specific PCR primers. DNA sequencing of PCR amplification products additionally revealed that 8 of the 12 plasmids belonged to the IncP subgroup, whereas 2 plasmids were identified as IncP plasmids. Analyses of the IncP specific PCR products revealed considerable differences among the IncP plasmids at the DNA sequence level. In order to characterize the 'load' of IncP plasmids, restriction fragments were cloned and DNA sequences established. A remarkable diversity of putative proteins encoded by these fragments was identified. Beside transposases or proteins involved in antibiotic resistance, these included a methyltransferase, a superoxide dismutase, parts of a putative efflux system, as well as proteins of unknown function.

40|$|In this paper, a {{complete}} design procedure is presented for an original structure of evanescent-mode filters {{which does not}} require special tuning techniques or subsequent optimization procedures beyond the design method itself. The method covers the cases of both rectangular and circular waveguide structures. The structure is composed of an air-filled waveguide containing a number of dielectric inserts. It is designed such that the air-filled sections are evanescent, while those with dielectric inserts operate in the normal propagative mode. Furthermore, the interfaces with the external source and load are achieved via a pair of air-filled guides of a propagative nature. The technique consists in finding a scattering description of all the filter sections and junctions relying on an exhaustive electromagnetic study of the field quantities and implying modal analysis methods. This leads to a scattering description of the entire structure and, subsequently, to an approximate lumped equivalent circuit model.

Scanning electronic microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX), imaging and stereology techniques were used as tools for this purpose.

For instance, the bilateral <b>filter,</b> <b>cross</b> bilateral <b>filter</b> and non-local means filter fall under the broad umbrella of high-dimensional Gaussian filters. Recent algorithmic advances therein have demonstrated that by relying on a sampled representation of the underlying space, one can obtain speed-ups of orders of magnitude over the naïve approach. The simplest such sampled representation is a lattice, {{and it has been}} used successfully in the bilateral grid and the permutohedral lattice algorithms. In this paper, we analyze these lattice-based algorithms, developing a general theory of lattice-based high-dimensional Gaussian filtering. We consider the set of criteria for an optimal lattice for filtering, as it offers a good tradeoff of quality for computational efficiency, and evaluate the existing lattices under the criteria. In particular, we give a rigorous exposition of the properties of the permutohedral lattice and argue that it is the optimal lattice for Gaussian filtering. Lastly, we explore further uses of the permutohedral-lattice-based Gaussian filtering framework, showing that it can be easily adapted to perform mean shift filtering and yield improvement over the traditional approach based on a Cartesian grid.

40|$|The {{cathodic}} arc plasmas {{produced by}} cathode spots usually include macroparticles, which is undesirable for many applications. A common way of removing macroparticles {{is to use}} curved solenoid filters which guide the plasma from the source to the substrate. In this work, an arc source with relatively small cathode is used, limiting the possible locations of plasma production. The relative position of cathodic arc source and macroparticle filtered was systematically varied and the filtered plasma current was recorded. It was found that axis-symmetric plasma injection leads to maximum throughput only if an anode aperture was used, which limited the plasma to near-axis flow by scraping off plasma at larger angles to the axis. When the anode aperture was removed, more plasma could enter the filter. In this case, maximum filtered ion current was achieved when the plasma was injected off-axis, namely offset in the direction where the filter is curved. Such behavior was anticipated because the plasma column in the filter {{is known to be}} shifted by ExB and centrifugal drift as well as by non-axis-symmetric components of the magnetic field in the filter entrance and exit plane. The data have implications for plasma transport variations caused by different spot locations on cathodes that are not small compared to the <b>filter</b> <b>cross</b> section...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{bilateral}} {{filter and}} its variants {{such as the}} Joint/Cross bilateral filter are well known edge-preserving image smoothing tools used in many applications. The reason of this success is its simple definition {{and the possibility of}} many adaptations. The bilateral filter is known to be related to robust estimation. This link is lost by the ad hoc introduction of the guide image in the Joint/Cross bilateral filter. We here propose a new way to derive the Joint/Cross bilateral filter as a particular case of a more generic filter which we name the Guided bilateral filter. This new filter is iterative, generic, inherits the robustness properties of the Robust bilateral filter and uses a guide image. The link with robust estimation allows us to relate the filter parameters with the statistics of input images. A scheme based on Graduated Non Convexity is proposed, which allows converging to an interesting local minimum even when the cost function is non-convex. With this scheme, the Guided bilateral filter can handle non-Gaussian noise on the image to be filtered. A complementary scheme is proposed to handle also non-Gaussian noise on the guide image even if both are strongly correlated. This allows the Guided bilateral filter to handle situations with more noise than the Joint/Cross bilateral filter can work with and leads to high Peak Signal to Noise Ratio PSNR values as shown experimentally.

40|$|In this research, we use high {{frequency}} waveform information {{to determine the}} focal mechanisms of small local earthquakes at an oil reservoir. During the waveform inversion, we maximize both the phase and amplitude matching between the observed and synthetic waveforms. In addition, we use the polarities of the first P-wave arrivals and the S/P amplitude ratios to better constrain the matching between the synthetic and observed waveforms. The objective function is constructed to include all four criteria. Due to the complexity in the objective function, {{it is almost impossible}} to directly perform an inversion with derivative techniques. Instead, an optimized grid search method is used to search over all possible ranges of fault strike, dip and rake, as well as a predetermined range of earthquake locations. To speed up the algorithm, a library of Green‟s functions is pre-calculated for each of the moment tensor components and possible earthquake locations. Careful optimizations in filtering and cross-correlation are performed to further improve the grid search algorithm, such that no <b>filtering</b> and <b>cross</b> correlations are performed in searching through the parameter space of strike, dip, and rake. Consequently, speed is boosted tenfold by these optimizations in <b>filtering</b> and <b>cross</b> correlation. We apply the new method to induced seismic events in an oil reservoir.
