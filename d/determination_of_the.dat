5|$|The {{only major}} {{measurement}} {{that could not}} be made automatically or before the mission was the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> windspeed and direction.

Taking this measurement while nearing the target was an important procedure on the CSBS; its manual included several methods of determining the wind. In the case of the Mk. XIV, the manual described only one method of determining the wind, equivalent to the most complex of the procedures from the CSBS model.|$|E
