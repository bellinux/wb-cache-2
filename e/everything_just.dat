5|$|We {{all had a}} {{collective}} feeling like we'd had enough {{of this kind of}} shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and <b>everything</b> <b>just</b> kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't going to go away. And we didn't.|$|E
25|$|I {{think it}} was just a {{reflection}} of the total anxiety and emotion of that period. There's {{a hell of a lot}} of spontaneity about that album. We went in with virtually nothing and <b>everything</b> <b>just</b> came pouring out.|$|E

2500|$|Afterwards, {{a police}} {{sergeant}} {{said that the}} main street in Marysville had been destroyed: [...] "The motel {{at one end of}} it partially exists. The bakery has survived. Don't ask me how. <b>Everything</b> else is <b>just</b> nuked." [...] Reports on 11 February estimated that around 100 of the town's population of approximately 500 had believed to have perished, and that only [...] "a dozen" [...] buildings were left. Premier Brumby described the situation: [...] "There's no activity, there's no people, there's no buildings, there's no birds, there's no animals, <b>everything's</b> <b>just</b> gone. So the fatality rate will be very high." ...|$|R
5000|$|The album {{featured}} {{a version of}} Yugoslav national anthem, [...] "Hej, Slaveni", as the opening track. The song [...] "Lipe cvatu, sve je isto k'o i lani" [...] ("Linden Trees Are in Bloom, <b>Everything's</b> <b>Just</b> Like It Used to Be") is musically based on the song [...] "Šta ću nano dragi mi je ljut" [...] ("What Can I Do, Mom, My Darling Is Angry"), written by Bregović and originally recorded by Bisera Veletanlić.|$|R
25|$|The way {{our studio}} {{operated}} was {{that anything that}} comes in – there’s no value judgments made about the music. We just record it. Still, {{one of the things}} that I guess was cool about being a staff engineer is that I wouldn’t have sought out a band like that. I wasn’t philosophically into anything that they were doing, but they were all good musicians – you would have to be to stay together at the speeds they were playing at. So there was that aspect of it, and just the whole pushing the envelope thing. It sounds like it’s just gonna completely break apart going 700 miles through the sky and then all of a sudden <b>everything</b> <b>just</b> comes right together again.|$|E
25|$|The last {{murder to}} involve Gravano was {{the murder of}} Louie DiBono, the made man Gravano had {{threatened}} to kill earlier. Gravano described {{the reasons for the}} murder in Underboss: He was still robbing the family and I asked for permission to take him out. But John had a meeting with DiBono, and DiBono told John that he had a billion dollars of drywall work that was coming out of the World Trade Center. John bit, hook, line and sinker, and refused my request. John said he would handle DiBono personally and become his partner. But DiBono was up to his old tricks double-dealing. He had obviously been bullshitting John. So when John called Louie in for meetings to discuss their new partnership, DiBono didn't show up. John was humiliated. This meant an automatic death penalty. John gave the contract to DiBono's captain, Pat Conte. Conte botched an ideal opportunity to kill DiBono. Then, as Gotti grew increasingly impatient, Conte explained that the problem now was trying to corner DiBono again. Whenever a meeting with him was arranged, DiBono never appeared. It was a joke, what was going on. I couldn't help laughing to myself. I told John why didn't Pat simplify <b>everything.</b> <b>Just</b> call Louie up and tell him to hang himself. Ten months went by. John looks like an asshole. He was too embarrassed even to ask me for help.|$|E
25|$|Working with Mona and Sara, {{the girls}} finally {{infiltrate}} A's lair, where they discover a live feed of Alison coming {{face to face}} with Charles, who is revealed to be CeCe Drake. CeCe then begins to explain her story and motives, revealing that she was born as Charles, but was not accepted by her father for believing she was a girl. She was sent to Radley, where she eventually transitioned into Charlotte. She also explains what led to Mrs. Cavanaugh's death at the hands of Bethany Young, her complicated relationship with Bethany and her subsequent death, the events regarding the night Alison disappeared, the deal she made with Mona, the events at the burning lodge, Wilden's death, the events in New York, and their mother's death. She explained that she did <b>everything</b> <b>just</b> to be closer to her family, and she became 'A' when she thought that the Liars were happy about Alison's 'death', so she wanted to make them suffer for it but couldn't stop the game because she grew obsessed with it. Cece also reveals that Sara is both the other Red Coat and The Black Widow, working under CeCe's orders, leaving Emily distraught. CeCe heads for the roof to commit suicide (after her bomb attempt fails and Emily subdues Sara), but Alison and the girls convince her to stop, saying they now understand why she became 'A'. CeCe then surrenders and declares the game over. On Labor Day weekend, the girls say goodbye as they are leaving for college except for Alison who stays in Rosewood.|$|E

500|$|While {{reviewing}} the game, many critics {{pointed out the}} quality of Guilbert's soundtrack. Eric Qualls praised the soundtrack, calling it a high point of the game. He stated that [...] "The same sound effects and similar music and <b>everything</b> <b>just</b> sounds right". Qualls went on to compliment Tobin Bell's voice as a good addition to {{the music and the}} environment. Reviewer Kadath Bird noted the absence of the Hello Zepp theme, though the review did not comment on the soundtrack itself.|$|E

500|$|The game's {{graphics}} {{were thought}} to be very good, using the id Tech 3 engine effectively. Describing the graphics as superb, Game Revolution commented that [...] "from detailed weapons to terrific lighting effects to smooth character animation, <b>everything</b> <b>just</b> looks great". Eurogamer commented that the characters were [...] "very well done" [...] on the engine, although Allgame felt that the character models for the original Voyager cast were [...] "just a little off". Other reviewers were equally impressed; IGN described the graphics as [...] "fantastic" [...] while GameSpy commented that [...] "in each environment it's obvious that the artists were limited only by their imaginations".|$|E

500|$|After {{starring}} in the modern-day Romeo and Juliet adaptation Love Is All There Is (1996), Jolie appeared in the road movie Mojave Moon (1996), of which The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "Jolie, an actress whom the camera truly adores, reveals a comic flair {{and the kind of}} blatant sexuality that makes it entirely credible that Danny Aiello's character would drop <b>everything</b> <b>just</b> for the chance of being with her." [...] In Foxfire (1996) she played a drifter who unites four teenage girls against a teacher who has sexually harassed them. Jack Mathews of the Los Angeles Times wrote of her performance, [...] "It took a lot of hogwash to develop this character, but Jolie, Jon Voight's knockout daughter, has the presence to overcome the stereotype. Though the story is narrated by Maddy, Legs is the subject and the catalyst." ...|$|E
500|$|As Frances Cleveland {{left the}} White House, {{she told a}} staff member, [...] "Now, Jerry, I {{want you to take}} good care of all the {{furniture}} and ornaments in the house, for I want to find <b>everything</b> <b>just</b> as it is now, when we come back again." [...] When asked when she would return, she responded, [...] "We are coming back four years from today." [...] In the meantime, the Clevelands moved to New York City where Cleveland took a position with the law firm of Bangs, Stetson, Tracy, and MacVeigh. This affiliation was more of an office sharing arrangement, though quite compatible. Cleveland's law practice brought only a moderate income, perhaps because Cleveland spent considerable time at the couple's vacation home Gray Gables at Buzzard Bay, where fishing became his obsession. While they lived in New York, the Clevelands' first child, Ruth, was born in 1891.|$|E
500|$|During {{the shoot}} {{of the music}} video for [...] "First" [...] (2005), Lohan {{revealed}} {{in an interview with}} MTV that she was preparing her sophomore studio album.

I'll still be in there until all hours, and it's {{nice to be able to}} do that." [...] Lohan began writing lyrics for the album in June 2005, after the last single from her previous album had been released. [...] "I've been writing a lot, almost every night," [...] she said. [...] "There's been a lot going on , and I think people can find that escape in hobbies that they do. I don't do yoga or anything, but some people use that. Everyone has their own thing, and I use writing." [...] Initially titled There's Only One Angel In Heaven, the pop rock album features a darker theme when compared to Lohan's previous album, Speak (2004).|$|E

500|$|Several of {{the songs}} from xx were {{licensed}} by XL to television programs in the UK and North America. [...] "Intro" [...] became widely used as theme music in television, including sports highlights, episodes of series such as Law & Order and Cold Case, an advertisement for AT, and BBC's coverage of the 2010 British general election. Along with their placement in television, songs from the record were used by North American chain stores such as Starbucks and Urban Outfitters as background music at their locations. According to McCormick, these marketing strategies helped the xx develop enough media presence to garner [...] "over half a million sales around the world without ever having anything as vulgar as a hit". Kris Chen, XL's A senior vice president, believed the exposure was desired and necessary for promoting an album that was not [...] "driven by pop radio". Although the band realised their music had to be marketed somehow, Croft expressed reservations about [...] "putting our music on <b>everything,</b> <b>just</b> to put it to anything {{just for the sake}} of money".|$|E
500|$|Horrible Histories was immediately, {{and almost}} universally, greeted with {{critical}} enthusiasm. On its debut, Alice-Azania Jarvis of The Independent described {{the show as}} [...] "fun, filthy and genuinely engaging, in a peer-to-peer way." [...] Harry Venning in The Stage approved the [...] "seriously funny, beautifully performed and endlessly inventive sketches" [...] along with [...] "plenty of crowd-pleasing fart and poo gags." [...] By the second series, the show's cross-generational appeal was beginning to attract significant attention from adult media. Naomi West of The Daily Telegraph characterised the first series as [...] "boundary-pushing", suggesting that [...] "the bold decision to approach the series {{in the same way}} as an adult show has been the key to its success... delivers more laughs than most post-watershed comedies." [...] James Delingpole in The Spectator likewise recommended the show to viewers of all ages, saying that [...] "Even though there are vast quantities of entirely gratuitous fart, bottom and wee wee jokes, the cumulative effect—bizarrely—is one of dumbing up rather than down." [...] Discussing the first two series in The Guardian, television writer Jesse Armstrong said that [...] "Hit shows are very difficult to achieve. You need to have <b>everything</b> <b>just</b> right—that's what's so terrifying. But Horrible Histories has a great cast and brilliant writers. They're also blessed with great source material. The tone is perfect and it is done in a non-patronising, engaging way".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed reviews. Several reviews wrote positively of {{the ensemble}} and character acting. Hannah Lawrence from Hollywood was happy with romance of the episode, writing [...] "It seems clear that the writers are spending more time on characters finding love, and I actually enjoy it very much ... I suspect the writers are aware that ultimately what all of us want for the Dunder-Mifflin employees is love." [...] CliqueClack wrote positively of the episode, praising the ensemble acting, and wrote, [...] "Overall, another solid ensemble episode. Way to go, The Office!" [...] Many other reviews compared the episode, either positively or negatively, to previous episodes. Jeffrey Hyatt from Screencrave gave the episode an 8/10 rating and wrote, [...] "I'd {{say it was the}} strongest of the six episodes so far this season ... 'Doomsday' delivered that classic, Office formula where <b>everything</b> <b>just</b> works – and it feels so right." [...] Joseph Kratzer from WhatCulture awarded the episode 3-and-a-half stars out of five and compared it to the season's previous episodes, writing, [...] "For a minute there I thought season eight of The Office was going {{to be some kind of}} subpar shut-out, but thankfully 'Doomsday' has lifted the series out of the rut it's been in ... I feel 'Doomsday' was successful because it captured a sense of ease and fluidity the show's been lacking severely since Michael's departure." ...|$|E
