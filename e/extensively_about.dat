5|$|Author Raven Grimassi {{has written}} <b>extensively</b> <b>about</b> Aradia in his popularization of Stregheria, {{presenting}} what he admits {{is his own}} personal rendering of her story. He differs from Leland in many ways, particularly in portraying her as a witch who lived and taught in 14th-century Italy, rather than a goddess.|$|E
5|$|British journalist, Fuad Omar, wrote <b>extensively</b> <b>about</b> {{the filming}} of the film in the UK, {{covering}} much of the shoot {{in a series of}} online articles and for regional press.

5|$|Apart {{from his}} own disciples and followers, the Jews of Jesus' day {{generally}} rejected him as the Messiah, as do {{the great majority of}} Jews today. Christian theologians, ecumenical councils, reformers and others have written <b>extensively</b> <b>about</b> Jesus over the centuries. Christian sects and schisms have often been defined or characterized by their descriptions of Jesus. Meanwhile, Manichaeans, Gnostics, Muslims, Baha'is, and others have found prominent places for Jesus in their religions. Jesus has also had detractors, both past and present.|$|E
5|$|John's coup {{was written}} <b>extensively</b> <b>about</b> by contemporaries: the {{historian}} Niketas Choniates deals with it briefly and rather dismissively, but Nicholas Mesarites left a long eyewitness account of events, {{in which his}} own role is suitably emphasized. The scholars Nikephoros Chrysoberges and Euthymios Tornikes wrote speeches in celebration of the coup's failure.|$|E
5|$|Nanoor is {{the birthplace}} of the 14th-century poet Chandidas Rami. Nityananda Swami (Nitai of the famous Nitai-Gaur pair) the co–founder of Vaishnav {{religion}} with Shri Chityanyadev was born at Ekachakra. Tarashankar Bandopadhyay (1898–1971), one of the leading Bengali literary figures in recent times and who wrote <b>extensively</b> <b>about</b> life in Birbhum, belongs to Labhpur.|$|E

5|$|Although several Roman sources {{including}} Livy and Polybius talk <b>extensively</b> <b>about</b> the Roman {{army of the}} Roman Kingdom {{period that}} followed the Etruscan capture of the city, no contemporary accounts survive. Polybius, for example, was writing some 300 years after the events in question, and Livy some 500 years later. Additionally, what records were kept by the Romans at this time were later destroyed when the city was sacked. The sources for this period cannot therefore be seen as reliable, {{as they can be}} for later military history, e.g. from the First Punic War onwards.|$|E
5|$|Hathaway wrote <b>extensively</b> <b>about</b> her {{relationship}} with her first husband in her 1961 autobiography. Dudley Beaumont, who served in the British army as an officer during the First World War, died on 24 November 1918 during the Spanish flu pandemic. His death left her a pregnant widow deprived of most of her income. Neither her father nor her father-in-law, the army officer William Spencer Beaumont, were willing to give financial support to the widow and her six surviving children. She learned German and started working for the YMCA in Cologne. She also worked for the British Army of the Rhine and raised prize cattle.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{then and}} now have been divided over Wilfrid. His {{followers}} commissioned Stephen of Ripon to write a Vita Sancti Wilfrithi (or Life of Wilfrid) shortly after his death, and the medieval historian Bede also wrote <b>extensively</b> <b>about</b> him. Wilfrid lived ostentatiously, and travelled with a large retinue. He ruled {{a large number of}} monasteries, and claimed to be the first Englishman to introduce the Rule of Saint Benedict into English monasteries. Some modern historians see him mainly as a champion of Roman customs against the customs of the British and Irish churches, others as an advocate for monasticism.|$|E

5|$|Luna, repenting for his blunder {{during the}} end of the first phase during Philippine Revolution, which ended at the Pact of Biak-na-Bato, then {{prepared}} himself for the second phase. Upon his release in December 1897, Luna studied field fortifications, guerrilla warfare, organization, and other aspects of military science under Gerard Leman, who would later be the commanding general of the fortress at Liège. He also read <b>extensively</b> <b>about</b> the discipline when he was at the Ateneo de Madrid. The second phase of the revolution began with the return of Emilio Aguinaldo to Cavite in 1898. Upon arriving in Hong Kong, he was given a letter of recommendation to Aguinaldo and a revolver by Felipe Agoncillo. He returned to the Philippines in July 1898.|$|E
5|$|The scandal was {{compounded}} when Oliver North {{destroyed or}} hid pertinent documents between November 21 and November 25, 1986. During North's trial in 1989, his secretary, Fawn Hall, testified <b>extensively</b> <b>about</b> helping North alter, shred, and remove official United States National Security Council (NSC) {{documents from the}} White House. According to the New York Times, enough documents were put into a government shredder to jam it. North's explanation for destroying some documents was to protect the lives of individuals involved in Iran and Contra operations. It was not until 1993, years after the trial, that North's notebooks were made public, and only after the National Security Archive and Public Citizen sued the Office of the Independent Counsel under the Freedom of Information Act.|$|E
5|$|In 1778, Curtis {{returned}} to Britain in Eagle, {{but refused to}} carry out an order to sail the ship to the Far East, a refusal which earned the enmity of Lord Sandwich. In December {{of the same year}} he was married to Jane Sarah Brady. As punishment for his disobedience Curtis was unemployed for the next two years, before he secured the new frigate HMS Brilliant for service in the Mediterranean in 1780. Ordered to Gibraltar, Brilliant was attacked by a superior Spanish squadron close to the fortress and was forced to escape to British-held Menorca. Curtis's first lieutenant Colin Campbell complained <b>extensively</b> <b>about</b> his captain's refusal to leave port while enemy shipping passed by the harbour, but Curtis was waiting for a 25-ship relief convoy which he met and safely convoyed into Gibraltar, bringing supplies to the defenders of the Great Siege of Gibraltar then in progress.|$|E

5|$|Literature in Virginia often {{deals with}} the state's {{extensive}} and sometimes troubled past. The works of Pulitzer Prize winner Ellen Glasgow often dealt with social inequalities {{and the role of}} women in her culture. Glasgow's peer and close friend James Branch Cabell wrote <b>extensively</b> <b>about</b> the changing position of gentry in the Reconstruction era, and challenged its moral code with Jurgen, A Comedy of Justice. William Styron approached history in works such as The Confessions of Nat Turner and Sophie's Choice. Tom Wolfe has occasionally dealt with his southern heritage in bestsellers like I Am Charlotte Simmons. Mount Vernon native Matt Bondurant received critical acclaim for his historic novel The Wettest County in the World about moonshiners in Franklin County during prohibition. Virginia also names a state Poet Laureate.|$|E
5|$|Marx had {{a special}} concern with how people relate to their own labour power. He wrote <b>extensively</b> <b>about</b> {{this in terms of}} the problem of {{alienation}}. As with the dialectic, Marx began with a Hegelian notion of alienation but developed a more materialist conception. Capitalism mediates social relationships of production (such as among workers or between workers and capitalists) through commodities, including labour, that are bought and sold on the market. For Marx, the possibility that one may give up ownership of one's own labour—one's capacity to transform the world—is tantamount to being alienated from one's own nature and it is a spiritual loss. Marx described this loss as commodity fetishism, in which the things that people produce, commodities, appear to have a life and movement of their own to which humans and their behaviour merely adapt.|$|E
5|$|Alongside his {{colleague}} Wei Pu, Shen planned {{to map the}} orbital paths of the Moon and the planets in an intensive five-year project involving daily observations, yet this was thwarted by political opponents at court. To aid his work in astronomy, Shen Kuo made improved designs of the armillary sphere, gnomon, sighting tube, and invented {{a new type of}} inflow water clock. Shen Kuo devised a geological hypothesis for land formation (geomorphology), based upon findings of inland marine fossils, knowledge of soil erosion, and the deposition of silt. He also proposed a hypothesis of gradual climate change, after observing ancient petrified bamboos that were preserved underground in a dry northern habitat that would not support bamboo growth in his time. He was the first literary figure in China to mention the use of the drydock to repair boats suspended out of water, and also wrote of the effectiveness of the relatively new invention of the canal pound lock. Although Ibn al-Haytham (965–1039) was the first to describe camera obscura, Shen was the first in China to do so, several decades later. Shen wrote <b>extensively</b> <b>about</b> movable type printing invented by Bi Sheng (990–1051), and because of his written works the legacy of Bi Sheng and the modern understanding of the earliest movable type has been handed down to later generations. Following an old tradition in China, Shen created a raised-relief map while inspecting borderlands. His description of an ancient crossbow mechanism which he himself unearthed proved to be a Jacob's staff, a surveying tool which wasn't known in Europe until described by Levi ben Gerson in 1321.|$|E
50|$|July and November 2007 interceptions {{between a}} businessman, Manlio Bruni, and Bracciali were found {{and they were}} <b>extensively</b> talking <b>about</b> gaining 50,000 euros each for a set won or lost {{depending}} on the match Bracciali was playing. The interceptions were published by several Italian tennis magazines.|$|R
50|$|It is {{believed}} that when the interior was rebuilt (or <b>extensively</b> altered) <b>about</b> 1725, the floor plan configuration was a hall and parlor, a two-room plan typical of this region throughout the 17th and early 18th centuries. Decorative details include paneling, molded chair-rails, and a Federal mantel.|$|R
50|$|Kinard House is a {{historic}} home located at Ninety Six, Greenwood County, South Carolina. It was built about 1885, and is a two-story, five bay, gable-front-and-wing Folk Victorian dwelling. It is clad in weatherboard and sits on a stone pier foundation. The house was <b>extensively</b> altered <b>about</b> 1920.|$|R
5|$|Contemporary jury {{consultants}} {{are often}} sociologists, people {{with experience in}} communications and marketing, or attorneys themselves, but they are most frequently psychologists and specialize in legal psychology. Although most of the practice's roots are in criminal trials, modern jury consultants are more often involved in torts (civil litigation), particularly where wealthy corporate defendants fear an enormous monetary judgment for the plaintiff, or where plaintiffs’ attorneys have invested {{large sums of money}} in an important lawsuit. Since the 1980s, large jury consulting and trial consulting firms have sprouted up with multi-million dollar incomes, mostly from such high-stakes civil litigation. The simultaneous shift from ad-hoc groups of academics to a business model has sparked the criticism that SJS magnifies the distorting effect money has on trials, since only the wealthy can afford it. Jury consultants argue that they operate in an adversarial process the same way lawyers do; by pursuing their clients' interests in a rule-bound framework. Jeffrey Abramson, who has written <b>extensively</b> <b>about</b> juries, argues that even if SJS is ethical or has zero effect, the mere myth of powerful, effective jury manipulators shakes public confidence in the jury system.|$|E
