40|$|The {{present study}} has been {{designed}} to provide information about any possible differentiation between the growth of deaf-mutes and the normal boys. A cross-sectional sample of 267 deaf-mute boys from 5 to 18 years was collected from various educational institutes of Punjab specially meant to teach hearing impaired children who were otherwise normal. Various anthropometric measurements were taken on each subject with the help of techniques given by Lohman et al. (1988) which included weight and height, humerus and femur bicondylar diameter, upper arm and calf circumferences, skinfolds at triceps and subscapular. In a nutshell, it has been found that the deaf-mute boys of the present study lag behind the normal in early years of life in height, have significantly smaller elbow widths and are more fatty at triceps skinfold. The ecological factors and mental attitude of the populace have not changed from those of the past in case of <b>deafmutes</b> while there is a tremendous improvement in the otherwise living standards of the general population. While the normal children seem to experience secular drifts in height, perhaps the deaf children remained mute spectators to the onward march of their normal peers in growth and development...|$|R
50|$|The {{institute}} {{was founded}} with the patronage and guidance of Count Celso Petrucci Bargagli and other donors, {{and the leadership}} of Pendola. By 1828, Pendola became the first director of the Royal Institute for the Deaf and Dumb (Sordomuti) of Siena, approved by a decree of Grand Duke Leopold II. The building had been first located on Via San Pietro #39, but subsequently moved to the present site, the buildings that used to house the medieval Convent of Santa Margherita. The original building housed and educated 50 <b>deafmute</b> boys. By 1835, a parallel institute for girls was established {{under the direction of}} nuns of the Congregation of Daughters of Charity of San Vincenzo de’ Paoli, with the male component housed in a building on the same street (#62).|$|E
50|$|Nordlund {{was born}} in Övre Stubbersbo, near Säter outside Falun. He had two siblings, Joel, an older brother who was a <b>deafmute,</b> and a younger brother named Rickard. Histories are told of the young Nordlund as an odd child who never laughed. In 1882 {{the family moved to}} Falun where Nordlund went to school, but being of an {{impatient}} nature he never finished school. Instead he took to the road, at first with a classmate who was an orphan, in 1886. Later that year, he was spotted by a friend of his parents in Hedemora, and returned to home. In 1887 he was on the run again, and as a person of both size and strength he had the ability to work, passing as an adult. For a brief period, one and a half years, he worked at a lumber mill in Korsnäs, which, according to himself, was the only time he tried to live an honest life. Still he gave in to temptation and forged a bill, which got him fired from the lumber mill. His parents had now moved to Gävle; Nordlund also lived there {{for a short period of}} time.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the first experiments {{of a speech}} to sign language translation system in a real domain. The developed system {{is focused on the}} sentences spoken by an officer when assisting people in applying for, or renewing the National Identification Document (NID) and the Passport. This system translates officer explanations into sign language for <b>deafmute</b> people. The translation system is composed by a speech recognizer (for decoding the spoken utterance into a word sequence), a natural language translator (for converting a word sequence into a sequence of gestures belonging to the sign language), and a 3 D avatar animation module (for playing the gestures). The field experiments have reported a 27. 2 % GER (Gesture Error Rate) and a 0. 62 BLE...|$|E
