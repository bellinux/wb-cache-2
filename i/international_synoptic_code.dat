40|$|Abstract. The {{development}} of international marine {{research in the}} Baltic Sea during the 20 th century and Estonian participation are described. The organization of the International Council for Exploration of the Sea and its different working groups connected to the research in the Baltic Sea is explained. The founding and activities of the Conference of Baltic Oceanographers and the Baltic Marine Biologists are described. The <b>international</b> <b>synoptic</b> investigations of the Baltic and especially the “Cooperative Synoptic Investigation of the Baltic”, “The International Baltic Year”, “Baltic Open Sea Experiment”, “Patchiness Experiment”, and “The Skagerrak Experiment ” and their results are briefly discussed. Some other recent international cooperation is also touched upon. Estonian participation in these activities is explained...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedPublished climatologies of marine-fog frequencies are in disagreement for common areas, although {{the nature and}} magnitude of errors are difficult to assess since actual frequencies for specific locations may be derived only from observations at Ocean Stations. The usual methods of computing fog frequencies, on a seasonal or monthly basis, are percent-of-reports-with-fog and number-of-fog-days. This study presents a method of synthesizing the elements of surface-ship synoptic reports into a computerized scheme {{for the purpose of}} deriving frequencies of marine fog occurrence. The program, based on a liberal interpretation of reporting guidelines in the <b>Synoptic</b> <b>Code</b> Manual, utilizes 16 combinations of present and past weather, and visibility, to identify fog in the reports. The program then objectively assigns the duration of fog for the three- or six-hour period represented by the synoptic report. A prototype climatology of marine-fog occurrence for July, over the eastern North Pacific Ocean, is derived from application of the method to a ten-year data base (1963 - 72). Results are compared to published and other defined marine-fog climatologies. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R
5000|$|Species: Altocumulus {{has four}} species. The {{stratiformis}} species (Ac str) {{is composed of}} sheets or relatively flat patches of stratocumuliform cloud. The <b>synoptic</b> <b>coding</b> {{is determined by the}} predominant variety or occasionally by the genitus mother cloud. Altocumulus lenticularis (Ac len lenticular cloud) is a lens-shaped middle cloud which can resemble flying saucers and may occasionally be mistaken for [...] "unidentified flying objects". This is formed by uplift usually associated with mountains. but usually with at least some grey shading. It is coded CM4 on the SYNOP weather observation. Grey shading is also seen with altocumulus castellanus (Ac cas), a turreted middle cloud that can achieve significant vertical development and signals increasing airmass instability. It is nevertheless usually classified as middle rather than vertical and is coded CM8. The floccus species (Ac flo) is a tufted middle cloud which is also associated with greater instability. It shares the same code CM8. Chaotic altocumulus, which is typically poorly defined with multiple species or transitional forms arranged in several layers, is coded CM9.|$|R
40|$|The {{long-term}} {{frequency of}} atmospheric dust observations was investigated {{for the southern}} part of Iceland and interpreted together with earlier results obtained from northeastern (NE) Iceland (Dagsson-Waldhauserova et al., 2013). In total, over 34 dust days per year on average occurred in Iceland based on conventionally used <b>synoptic</b> <b>codes</b> for dust observations. However, frequent volcanic eruptions, with the re-suspension of volcanic materials and dust haze, increased the number of dust events fourfold (135 dust days annually). The position of the Icelandic Low determined whether dust events occurred in the NE (16. 4 dust days annually) or in the southern (S) part of Iceland (about 18 dust days annually). The decade with the most frequent dust days in S Iceland was the 1960 s, but the 2000 s in NE Iceland. A total of 32 severe dust storms (visibility < 500 m) were observed in Iceland with the highest frequency of events during the 2000 s in S Iceland. The Arctic dust events (NE Iceland) were typically warm, occurring during summer/autumn (May–September) and during mild southwesterly winds, while the subarctic dust events (S Iceland) were mainly cold, occurring during winter/spring (March–May) and during strong northeasterly winds. About half of the dust events in S Iceland occurred in winter or at sub-zero temperatures. A good correlation was found between particulate matter (PM 10) concentrations and visibility during dust observations at the stations Vík and Stórhöfði. This study shows that Iceland is among the dustiest areas of the world and that dust is emitted year-round...|$|R

The depression was associated with extreme weather phenomena such as thunderstorms, strong winds, dust and high precipitation accumulations (amounting to 50 % of the mean monthly value). The results underline the importance of the dynamic control on the cyclone's development and the important contribution of the system itself in the energetics of the atmosphere. The thermodynamic analysis has proved a very useful tool in identifying the convective potential of the atmosphere at various stages of the development...|$|R

This determination {{has the potential}} of revealing all aspects of the ocean dynamic variability {{on a wide range of}} spatiotemporal scales and will enhance our understanding of ocean–atmosphere exchanges at superresolution, as required in the present context of climate change. Here, we show a four-year time series of spatial superresolution (4 km) turbulent ocean dynamics generated from satellite data using emerging ideas in signal processing coming from nonlinear physics, low-resolution dynamics, and superresolution oceanic sea surface temperature data acquired from optical sensors. The method at its core consists in propagating across the scales the low-resolution dynamics in a multiresolution analysis computed on adimensional critical transition information...|$|R
40|$|Until 1982, {{when the}} National Research Institute for Oceanology (NRIO) erected self-contained, {{automatic}} weather stations (AWS) on the Cape South Coast, no continuous coastal measurements were available. This Institute had erected an AWS on {{the drilling rig}} Sedco K in 1978, so that over 3 years of very valuable off- shore data was already available on the adjacent Agulhas Bank. Al though the weather offices at George and Port Elizabeth have made accurate meteorological observations for over 30 years, this data is shown here to differ significantly from actual coastal measurements. Thus the NRIO AWS network, which operated for just over a year, provided a detailed, short-term data set {{for the study of}} coastal weather processes. In order to acquire longer term data from coastal observations, five years of hourly wind observations from lighthouse keepers along the Cape South Coast were also utilised. Although these are estimates, it is shown that a coastal estimate may be more representative of marine conditions than an anemometer reading some distance inland. Voluntary Observing Ship's data (VOS) extracted from SADCO's Marine Climatology database, provided the long-term offshore information, whilst also supplying very useful 'present weather' (<b>synoptic</b> <b>code</b> ww) observations for case studies. Observations from synoptic stations for the period that the coastal AWS were deployed (February 1982 - March 1983), were provided by the South African Weather Bureau. With this unique and comprehensive data set, the various weather systems affecting the region are discussed. Twelve case studies form the main reference for this discussion, which includes relevant oceanographic parameters. The weather systems are considered firstly as individually propagating circulations with the AWS network providing details of propagation speeds and coastwise development. Secondly the combined 'weather producing' effects of these systems are discussed, with a strong emphasis being placed on man/weather interactions. It is shown that certain operations along the Cape South Coast and over the Agulhas Bank, are extremely weather sensitive, and would benefit considerably from an increased knowledge of weather processes. Recommendations aimed not only at those managing weather sensitive operations, but also at those involved in coastal meteorological measurement and research, complete the thesis...|$|R

40|$|SLAC-PUB- 14162 <b>International</b> audiencehe Large <b>Synoptic</b> Survey Telescope (LSST) will {{continuously}} {{image the}} entire sky visible from Cerro Pachon in northern Chile every 3 - 4 nights throughout the year. The LSST will provide data {{for a broad}} range of science investigations that require better than 1 % photometric precision across the sky (repeatability and uniformity) and a similar accuracy of measured broadband color. The fast and persistent cadence of the LSST survey will significantly improve the temporal sampling rate with which celestial events and motions are tracked. To achieve these goals, and to optimally utilize the observing calendar, {{it will be necessary to}} obtain excellent photometric calibration of data taken over a wide range of observing conditions - even those not normally considered "photometric". To achieve this it will be necessary to routinely and accurately measure the full optical passband that includes the atmosphere as well as the instrumental telescope and camera system. The LSST mountain facility will include a new monochromatic dome illumination projector system to measure the detailed wavelength dependence of the instrumental passband for each channel in the system. The facility will also include an auxiliary spectroscopic telescope dedicated to measurement of atmospheric transparency at all locations in the sky during LSST observing. In this paper, we describe these systems and present laboratoryand observational data that illustrate their performanc...|$|R
40|$|<b>International</b> audienceComprehensive <b>synoptic</b> {{datasets}} (surface {{water down}} to 4000 m) of dissolved cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), lead (Pb) and silver (Ag) are presented along a section between 34 ° S and 57 ° S {{in the southeastern}} Atlantic Ocean and the Southern Ocean to the south off South Africa. The vertical distributions of Cu and Ag display nutrient-like profiles similar to silicic acid, and of Cd similar to phosphate. The distribution of Mn shows a subsurface maximum in the oxygen minimum zone, whereas Pb concentrations are rather invariable with depth. Dry deposition of aerosols {{is thought to be}} an important source of Pb to surface waters close to South Africa, and dry deposition and snowfall may have been significant sources of Cu and Mn at the higher latitudes. Furthermore, the advection of water masses enriched in trace metals following contact with continental margins appeared to be an important source of trace elements to the surface, intermediate and deep waters in the southeastern Atlantic Ocean and the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Hydrothermal inputs may have formed a source of trace metals to the deep waters over the Bouvet Triple Junction ridge crest, as suggested by relatively enhanced dissolved Mn concentrations. The biological utilization of Cu and Ag was proportional to that of silicic acid across the section, suggesting that diatoms formed an important control over the removal of Cu and Ag from surface waters. However, uptake by dino- and nano-flagellates may have influenced the distribution of Cu and Ag in the surface waters of the subtropical Atlantic domain. Cadmium correlated strongly with phosphate (P), yielding lower Cd / P ratios in the subtropical surface waters where phosphate concentrations were below 0. 95 μM. The greater depletion of Cd relative to P observed in the Weddell Gyre compared to the Antarctic Circumpolar Current could be due to increase Cd uptake induced by iron-limiting conditions in these high-nutrient-low-chlorophyll waters. Similarly, an increase of Mn uptake under Fe-depleted conditions may have caused the highest depletion of Mn relative to P in the surface waters of the Weddell Gyre. In addition, a cellular Mn-transport channel of Cd was possibly activated in the Weddell Gyre, which in turn may have yielded depletion of both Mn and Cd in these surface waters...|$|R
40|$|M. A. This work {{is aimed}} at dealing with the demand for the new ethos as proclaimed by the New Testament {{synoptic}} {{in view of the}} African context or perspective. The <b>synoptic</b> give a <b>code</b> of values by which the Christian church should live. The synoptic ethos is Jesus' ethos. Every nation and community is characterised by certain values of conduct. As a church we are also confronted by moments of decision making. This script is therefore attempting to answer or question the level of credibility taken at some point in life. Ethics which is a science of moral behaviour and principles of conduct, tells us that there is an expected way of behaviour from every individual in society. The question is when, when do we say that this is right, and when do we say this is wrong ? However, this script is not aimed at necessarily dealing with ethics in general. I have narrowed my subject to focus on the Kingdom ethos reflected in the synoptic. The only issue that one need to take into consideration is that all ethics have sources. The problem that existed in proclaiming Kingdom ethics has been religion. This script shows that religion and ethics are so interwoven that one cannot separate them. It is impossible for one to speak about one's moral behaviour and not include his religion. Religion tells people what to say and what not, what to eat and what not, where to go and what people to associate with and not. Religion and ethics are integrated in such w way that one cannot do without the other. One cannot speak about ethics outside religion. The ethos of the Jews came from their monotheistic religion, with the Law of Moses. Jesus' ethics came from His focus on the Kingdom which was both present and future. This shows again the problem of religion in Africa. African ethics have been drawn mostly from their own cultures, customs and religion. Jesus' Kingdom ethics, which is God centred, helps to show that all other sources are not relevant sources. Many church leaders in Africa are calling for an African religion and criticising the missionaries for having brought Western religion. The Kingdom ethics show how that it is not Western or African religion that matters much, all we need is the Christian religion and Jesus' ethos of the Kingdom. Finally the church is expected to play its role of reconciling this divided world. The purpose of the church is man, his human dignity and his right to develop himself in freedom. Jesus commanded the church to love, hence it is the duty of the church to be the prophetic voice of God in this confused generation. The ethics demanded by Jesus are practical and possible. We need God's mercy and grace to be real ambassadors of the Kingdom of God. As a church we have a responsibility. We need to move away from syncretism and serve God alone...|$|R
