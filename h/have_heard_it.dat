25|$|Isolation — Richard Wiseman {{and others}} argue {{that not all of}} the studies used {{soundproof}} rooms, so it is possible that when videos were playing, the experimenter could <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it,</b> and later given involuntary cues to the receiver during the selection process. It could even have been possible that the receiver themselves could hear the video.|$|E
25|$|An {{emphasis}} on oral transmission {{as more important}} than the printed word derives from the earliest period of Indian Buddhism, when it allowed teachings to be kept from those who should not hear them. Hearing a teaching (transmission) readies the hearer for realization based on it. The person from whom one hears the teaching should <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> as one link in a succession of listeners going back to the original speaker: the Buddha {{in the case of a}} sutra or the author in the case of a book. Then the hearing constitutes an authentic lineage of transmission. Authenticity of the oral lineage is a prerequisite for realization, hence the importance of lineages.|$|E
25|$|A {{meta-analysis}} of 208 experiments {{found that the}} mere-exposure effect is robust and reliable, with an effect size of r=0.26. This analysis found that the effect is strongest when unfamiliar stimuli are presented briefly. Mere exposure typically reaches its maximum effect within 10–20 presentations, and some studies even show that liking may decline after a longer series of exposures. For example, people generally like a song more after they <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> a few times, but many repetitions can reduce this preference. A delay between exposure and the measurement of liking actually tends to increase {{the strength of the}} effect. The effect is weaker on children, and for drawings and paintings as compared to other types of stimuli. One social psychology experiment showed that exposure to people we initially dislike makes us dislike them even more.|$|E

Richard Twining, the tea merchant, however, was advised by his brother John to send his eldest son to Norwich, writing of Parr, [...] "I {{have been told that}} he flogs too much, but I doubt those from whom I <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> think any use of punishment too much". Parr's daily teaching was interrupted at midday when he sent a boy to the pastry-cook's across the road for a pie, which he ate by the schoolroom fire. On the resignation of his headship in 1785, historian Warren Derry comments, [...] "an object of terror was gone, but the glory of the place had gone with it".|$|E

[...] "Sparks Fly" [...] was written by Swift when she was sixteen years old, prior the release of her eponymous album in 2006. She {{performed}} the song live during several bar shows [...] "of forty and fifty people". A recorded live performance of the song during one of her concerts made its way onto the internet in 2007. The song became a favorite among Swift's fans, leading Swift to rework the song and include it on Speak Now after having so many requested {{for it to be}} included on the album. Of the song, Swift said that: [...] "This is a song I wrote {{a few years ago and}} I have been working on it ever since. It's been awesome to see it change over the years. The fans <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> before in concert, but there have been some really cool changes that I am very proud of and can't wait for them to hear." ...|$|E

500|$|Many Stanford alumni {{were upset}} with the {{decision}} to hire Shaughnessy. The most popular candidates for the vacant position were two Stanford alumni themselves: San Jose State coach Dudley DeGroot, and Santa Clara coach Buck Shaw. Some believed the Shaughnessy hiring was a ploy to eventually eliminate football at the school, as had happened at both Loyola and Chicago the year prior. The Bay Area media mocked the Shaughnessy hiring as comically inept. They believed that a prestigious academic school had foolishly hired an inveterate loser as its head coach. Prescott Sulivan of the San Francisco Examiner and Jack McDonald of the San Francisco Call-Bulletin coined the nickname [...] "Soup" [...] for Shaughnessy, which they sarcastically explained was a diminutive for the word [...] "super". Sullivan wrote, [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> said that Shaughnessy has developed the knack of losing to the point where, with him, it is an exact science. In light of his record, we aren't at all surprised at this." [...] The Stanford players were also skeptical of Shaughnessy's abilities. Center Milt Vucinich said, [...] "We'd been reading about all those beatings Shaughnessy's men had taken, so we were joking among ourselves that wasn't it just like Stanford to hire somebody like this to coach us." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{band has}} named the group Melvins as an {{influence}} on its development, but the most-publicized influence is progressive rock pioneer group King Crimson. Longtime King Crimson member Robert Fripp has downplayed any influence his band had on Tool. In an interview, Fripp touched on how the two bands relate to each other, stating [...] "Do you hear the influence? There's just one figure where I hear an influence, just one. It was a piece we were developing that we dropped. And it's {{almost exactly the same}} figure: three note arpeggio with a particular accent from the guitar. So I do not think you could <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it.</b> That's the only thing." [...] He also said, [...] "I happen to be a Tool fan. The members of Tool have been generous enough to suggest that Crimson has been {{an influence on}} them. Adam Jones asked me if I could detect it in their music, and I said I couldn’t. I can detect more Tool influence in King Crimson, than I can hear King Crimson in Tool." [...] In describing their wide range of styles, critics have noted that they are [...] "influenced as much by Pink Floyd as by the Sex Pistols". Other reported influences of the band include Rush, Helmet, Faith No More and Jane's Addiction.|$|E
500|$|According to Betty Cortina of People magazine, Dreaming of You {{marked a}} shift that abrogated the singer being marketed {{as part of}} her band and billed Selena as an American solo artist in [...] "the most {{fundamental}} way for her". From 1989, Selena's brother A.B. Quintanilla became Selena's principal music producer and songwriter, and remained so throughout her career. Because Quintanilla III was working on the singer's follow-up recording to Amor Prohibido (1994), he could not produce the crossover album. He was asked to meet with several producers in New York and choose one who would best [...] "fit with Selena's style". Dreaming of You was the first album Selena's family did not produce. They had decided to step down before the recording sessions and allow professional pop producers to work with her. Quintanilla III and Selena flew to Nashville, Tennessee, and met with Keith Thomas, who had prepared the instrumental parts for the song called [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] but had not yet completed the vocal parts, so he sang it for them. Selena and Quintanilla III immediately liked it; Quintanilla III said he wanted Selena to include it on her album. [...] Recording sessions began in December 1994 at The Bennett House in Franklin, Tennessee; Selena had to return later when Thomas could provide additional vocals. Selena and her husband Chris Pérez arrived at the studio on March 24, 1995 to finish recording the song. In a 2002 interview, Pérez said Thomas provided Selena with a cassette of [...] "I Could Fall in Love" [...] and said she had the song [...] "on loop" [...] and she [...] "must <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> a hundred times". He believed it had an [...] "effect on her" [...] because [...] "she went into the studio the next day to actually do the recording and just was nailing things left and right and [...] was letting her do her thing and I mean it was an incredible thing to watch".|$|E

2500|$|Both the cognoscenti and {{the public}} adored him.

[...] Some fans were more unrestrained: one titled lady was so carried away that, from a theatre box, she famously exclaimed: [...] "One God, one Farinelli!"

According to him, there had been no extensive shelling of the Georgian villages on the evening or night of August 7. Young added, that if there had been shelling of Georgian villages that evening, the OSCE monitors at the scene would <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it.</b> According to him, the monitors only heard occasional small arms fire.|$|E

In the English-speaking world, Frederic Raphael wrote that no one could recommend the book [...] "without having a tin ear for fiction and a blind eye for evil." [...] Ron Rosenbaum, criticizing the film adaptation of The Reader, wrote that even if Germans like Hanna were metaphorically [...] "illiterate", [...] "they could <b>have</b> <b>heard</b> <b>it</b> from Hitler's mouth in his infamous 1939 radio broadcast to Germany and the world, threatening extermination of the Jews if war started.

2500|$|In May 1977 George and Kathy Lutz filed {{a lawsuit}} against William Weber (the defense lawyer for Ronald DeFeo, Jr. at his trial), Paul Hoffman (a writer working on an account of the hauntings), Bernard Burton and Frederick Mars (both alleged clairvoyants who had {{examined}} the house), along with Good Housekeeping magazine, the New York Sunday News and the Hearst Corporation, all of which had published articles related to the hauntings. The Lutzes alleged invasion of privacy, misappropriation of names for trade purposes, and mental distress, and claimed $4.5million in damages. Hoffman, Weber, and Burton immediately filed a countersuit for $2million alleging fraud and breach of contract. The claims against the news corporations were dropped for lack of evidence, and the remainder of the lawsuit was heard by Brooklyn U.S. District Court judge Jack B. Weinstein. In September 1979, Judge Weinstein dismissed the Lutzes' claims and observed in his ruling: [...] "Based on what I <b>have</b> <b>heard,</b> <b>it</b> appears to me that to a large extent the book is a work of fiction, relying in a large part upon the suggestions of Mr. Weber." [...] In the September 17, 1979 issue of People magazine, William Weber wrote: [...] "I know this book is a hoax. We created this horror story over many bottles of wine." [...] This refers to a meeting that Weber is said to have had with George and Kathy Lutz, during which they discussed what would later become the outline of Anson's book. Judge Weinstein also expressed concern about the conduct of William Weber and Bernard Burton relating to the affair, stating: [...] "There is a very serious ethical question when lawyers become literary agents." ...|$|E
