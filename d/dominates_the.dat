5|$|Although the Sun <b>dominates</b> <b>the</b> {{system by}} mass, it {{accounts}} for only about 2% of the angular momentum. The planets, dominated by Jupiter, account {{for most of the}} rest of the angular momentum due to the combination of their mass, orbit, and distance from the Sun, with a possibly significant contribution from comets.|$|E

5|$|Neptune's orbit has a {{profound}} impact on the region directly beyond it, known as the Kuiper belt. The Kuiper belt is a ring of small icy worlds, similar to the asteroid belt but far larger, extending from Neptune's orbit at 30AU out to about 55AU from the Sun. Much {{in the same way that}} Jupiter's gravity <b>dominates</b> <b>the</b> asteroid belt, shaping its structure, so Neptune's gravity <b>dominates</b> <b>the</b> Kuiper belt. Over the age of the Solar System, certain regions of the Kuiper belt became destabilised by Neptune's gravity, creating gaps in the Kuiper belt's structure. The region between 40 and 42AU is an example.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{the opera}} Monteverdi makes {{innovative}} use of polyphony, extending the rules beyond the conventions which composers normally observed in fidelity to Palestrina. He combines {{elements of the}} traditional 16th-century madrigal with the new monodic style where the text <b>dominates</b> <b>the</b> music and sinfonias and instrumental ritornellos illustrate the action.|$|E
5|$|A {{resolution}} to this apparent inconsistency {{is offered by}} inflationary theory in which a homogeneous and isotropic scalar energy field <b>dominates</b> <b>the</b> universe at some very early period (before baryogenesis). During inflation, the universe undergoes exponential expansion, and the particle horizon expands much more rapidly than previously assumed, so that regions presently {{on opposite sides of}} the observable universe are well inside each other's particle horizon. The observed isotropy of the CMB then follows from the fact that this larger region was in causal contact before the beginning of inflation.|$|E

25|$|From 1890 to 1930, {{the larger}} cities were {{the focus of}} {{national}} attention. The skyscrapers and tourist attractions were widely publicized. Suburbs existed, but they were largely bedroom communities for commuters to the central city. San Francisco <b>dominated</b> <b>the</b> West, Atlanta <b>dominated</b> <b>the</b> South, Boston <b>dominated</b> New England; Chicago, the nation's railroad hub, <b>dominated</b> <b>the</b> Midwest United States; however, New York City <b>dominated</b> <b>the</b> entire nation in terms of communications, trade, finance, popular culture, and high culture. More than a fourth of the 300 largest corporations in 1920 were headquartered in New York City.|$|R
5|$|Agriculture <b>dominates</b> <b>the</b> {{northern}} shore, {{where many}} plots of land are still {{owned by the}} descendants of early settlers. The largely abandoned historical communities of Rosita and West Portland are also located in this area. To the west, the Odem Bay extension is formed, and is fed by Rincon Bayou and a large complex of marsh formed by the Nueces River delta. Just south of the mouth, are {{the remains of the}} abandoned Nuecestown settlement, which is now included in the Corpus Christi city limits.|$|E
5|$|As the 100,000-year {{periodicity}} only <b>dominates</b> <b>the</b> {{climate of}} the past million years, there is insufficient information to separate the component frequencies of eccentricity using spectral analysis, making the reliable detection of significant longer-term trends more difficult, although the spectral analysis of much longer palaeoclimate records, such as the Lisiecki and Raymo stack of marine cores and James Zachos' composite isotopic record, helps to put the last million years in longer term context. Hence {{there is still no}} clear proof of the mechanism responsible for the 100ka periodicityâ€”but there are several credible hypotheses.|$|E
5|$|Between 1087 and 1089, Rufus asked Gundulf, Bishop of Rochester, {{to build}} a new stone castle at Rochester. He {{established}} the current extent of the castle. Though much altered through the centuries, some parts of Gundulf's work survive. In 1127 King HenryI granted the castle to the Archbishop of Canterbury in perpetuity. William de Corbeil built the massive keep that still <b>dominates</b> <b>the</b> castle today. Throughout the 12thcentury the castle remained in the custody of the archbishops.|$|E

5|$|In home matches, the team's outfield players {{traditionally}} {{wear the}} colours of the Belgian flag: black, yellow and red.

Their shirts are often trimmed with tricolores at the margins.

5|$|Not all parallelization {{results in}} speed-up.
