To this end, we experimentally and numerically investigated the damage process and the damage-induced changes in the spectrum shape. It was experimentally confirmed that multiple types of damage (e. g., splits, transverse cracks and delamination) appeared near a hole, and that the spectrum shape of the embedded chirped FBG sensor changed as the damage extended. Our proposed simulation for the reflection spectrum considering the damage agreed with the experiments. Furthermore, this study investigated the effect of each damage pattern on the changes in the spectrum shape. Finally, based on these discussions, we present simple <b>damage</b> <b>identifications</b> with the embedded chirped FBG for the holed CFRP laminates under completely unloaded conditions...|$|R

50|$|Observations in the {{literature}} survey regarding the different damage models are similar, i.e., they are not generic. In spite of considerable progress in the <b>damage</b> <b>identification</b> using vibrationbased methods, there is still lack of a fairly successful algorithm todetect damage as concluded in all the reviews since 1995. In 1995,in the review published by Dimarogonas (1996), it is concluded “Aconsistent cracked beam vibration theory {{is yet to be}} developed”.In 2005, in another review about vibration based structural healthmonitoring, Carden and Fanning (2004) conclude, “There is no universalagreement as to the optimum method for using measured vibration data for damage detection, location or quantification”.Similarly in 2007, Montalvao et al. (2006) state as one of the conclusions,“There is no general algorithm that allows the resolutionof all kinds of problems in all kinds of structures”. Similar trendregarding lack of generality of proposed models is seen in the latestreview by Fan and Qiao (2010).|$|E
50|$|The {{portion of}} the SHM process that has {{received}} the least attention in the technical literature {{is the development of}} statistical models for discrimination between features from the undamaged and damaged structures. Statistical model development is concerned with the implementation of the algorithms that operate on the extracted features to quantify the damage state of the structure. The algorithms used in statistical model development usually fall into three categories. When data are available from both the undamaged and damaged structure, the statistical pattern recognition algorithms fall into the general classification referred to as supervised learning. Group classification and regression analysis are categories of supervised learning algorithms. Unsupervised learning refers to algorithms that are applied to data not containing examples from the damaged structure. Outlier or novelty detection is the primary class of algorithms applied in unsupervised learning applications. All of the algorithms analyze statistical distributions of the measured or derived features to enhance the <b>damage</b> <b>identification</b> process.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} {{structural}} damage detection method based on wavelet packet decomposition, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and a relevance vector machine (RVM). First, vibration data at multiple points {{are used to}} calculate the wavelet packet node energies and construct a non-negative damage feature matrix. Second, to increase the damage detection accuracy, the NMF technique is employed to obtain the reduced dimensional representation of the non-negative damage feature matrix and extract the underlying features. Last, the RVM, a powerful tool for classification and regression, that can obtain the probability estimation for classification, is used to determine the relationship between features extracted with NMF and the corresponding damage patterns by considering the measurement noise. The trained RVMs are then used to perform <b>damage</b> pattern <b>identification</b> and classification of an unknown state structure. Numerical study on the Binzhou Yellow River Highway Bridge is carried out to validate the ability of the proposed method in damage detection.

50|$|Because {{data can}} be {{measured}} under varying conditions, the ability to normalize the data becomes {{very important to the}} <b>damage</b> <b>identification</b> process. As it applies to SHM, data normalization is the process of separating changes in sensor reading caused by damage from those caused by varying operational and environmental conditions. One of the most common procedures is to normalize the measured responses by the measured inputs. When environmental or operational variability is an issue, the need can arise to normalize the data in some temporal fashion to facilitate the comparison of data measured at similar times of an environmental or operational cycle. Sources of variability in the data acquisition process and with the system being monitored need to be identified and minimized to the extent possible. In general, not all sources of variability can be eliminated. Therefore, it is necessary to make the appropriate measurements such that these sources can be statistically quantified. Variability can arise from changing environmental and test conditions, changes in the data reduction process, and unit-to-unit inconsistencies.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} common feature {{extraction}} methods is based on correlating measured system response quantities, such a vibration amplitude or frequency, with the first-hand observations of the degrading system. Another method of developing features for <b>damage</b> <b>identification</b> is to apply engineered flaws, similar to ones expected in actual operating conditions, to systems and develop an initial understanding of the parameters that are sensitive to the expected damage. The flawed system {{can also be used to}} validate that the diagnostic measurements are sensitive enough to distinguish between features identified from the undamaged and damaged system. The use of analytical tools such as experimentally-validated finite element models can be a great asset in this process. In many cases the analytical tools are used to perform numerical experiments where the flaws are introduced through computer simulation. Damage accumulation testing, during which significant structural components of the system under study are degraded by subjecting them to realistic loading conditions, can also be used to identify appropriate features. This process may involve induced-damage testing, fatigue testing, corrosion growth, or temperature cycling to accumulate certain types of damage in an accelerated fashion. Insight into the appropriate features can be gained from several types of analytical and experimental studies as described above and is usually the result of information obtained from some combination of these studies.|$|E

40|$|Highway bridges are {{subjected}} to the dynamic tire forces of moving vehicles. This paper attempts to identify local damages in box-girder highway bridges from the dynamic responses induced by passing vehicle. The box-girder bridge is modeled using four-node iso-parametric flat shell element {{taking into account the}} transverse shearing deformation in the finite element model. The vehicle is modeled as a two degree-of-freedom system. The local damage is simulated by a reduction in the elemental Young's modulus. In the forward analysis, a coupled bridge-vehicle system is built using the finite element analysis. In the inverse analysis, a dynamic response sensitivity-based finite element model updating approach is used to identify local damage in the element level. The solution is obtained iteratively with the penalty function method with regularization from the measured structural dynamic responses. A single-span box-girder bridge is studied as a numerical example. The effects measurement noise and measurement time duration on the identification results are investigated.

The responses of vibrating structures due to the moving object and different methodologies for <b>damaged</b> <b>identification</b> process have been investigated in this analogy. The theoretical-numerical solutions of the multi-cracked structure with different end conditions subjected to transit mass have been formulated. The Runge-Kutta fourth order integration approach has been applied to determine the response of the structures numerically. The effects of parameters like mass and speed of the traversing object, crack locations, and depth on the response of the structures are investigated. The proposed numerical method has been verified using FEA and experimental investigations. The novel damage prediction processes are developed on the knowledge-based concepts of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and statistical process control (SPC) methods as inverse approaches. The Jordan’s recurrent neural networks (JRNNs), Elman’s recurrent neural network (ERNNs), the integrated approach of the JRNNs, and ERNNs, the autoregressive (AR) process in the domain of SPC and the combined hybrid neuro-autoregressive process have been developed to identify and quantify the faults in the structure.
