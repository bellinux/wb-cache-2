The demand was for an Independent state called Dravida Nadu (country of Dravidians) comprising Tamil Nadu and parts of Andhra, Karnataka and Kerala. The increased involvement of the Indian National Congress party in Madras during the late 1950s and the strong pan-Indian emotions whipped up by the Chinese invasion of India in 1962 led to the demand for Dravida Nadu losing some of its immediacy. Consequently, in 1963, when the Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution of India, precluded secessionist parties from contesting elections, the DMK chose to formally drop its demand for an independent Dravida Nadu, focusing instead on securing greater <b>functional</b> <b>autonomy</b> {{within the framework of}} the Indian Constitution.|$|E

The extent of the particularisms - clientelism and patronage, blurred <b>functional</b> <b>autonomies</b> and boundaries, violations of horizontal accountabilities, manipulations of the media and judiciary, harassment of Opposition elites, personal vendettas, persecutions of minorities - define these power games, and they can be linked systematically to the patterns of elite unity, differentiation, and circulation.

His {{original}} motive may be a sense of inferiority engrained in his childhood, but his diligence in his work and the motive it acquires later on is a need to excel in his chosen profession, which becomes the man's drive. Allport says that the theory: [...] "...avoids the absurdity of regarding the energy of life now, in the present, as somehow consisting of early archaic forms (instincts, prepotent reflexes, or the never-changing Id). Learning brings new systems of interests into existence just as it does new abilities and skills. At each stage of development these interests are always contemporary; whatever drives, drives now."

40|$|Abstract Many anticipatory systems cannot in {{themselves}} act meaningfully or represent intentionally. This stems {{largely from the}} derivative nature of their functionality. All current artificial control systems, and many living systems such as organs and cellular parts of organisms derive any intentionality they might have from their designers or possessors. Derivative functionality requires reference to some external autonomously functional system, and derivative intentionality similarly requires reference to an external autonomous intentional system. The importance of autonomy {{can be summed up}} in the following slogan: No meaning without intention; no intention without function; no function without autonomy. This paper develops the role of autonomy to show how learning new tasks is facilitated by autonomy, and further by representational capacities that are <b>functional</b> for <b>autonomy...</b>|$|R

Both approaches using integrated mainframe systems and approaches using isolated modular minicomputers fail to realize this ideal in several categories.

In order to contribute to this debate, this article has provided an in-depth comparative and historical analysis of labour market activation policies targeting newly arrived immigrants since the early 1990 s until 2015 and thereby contributed to the question of: To what extent do the institutional pathways of the Scandinavian welfare states prevail when confronted with newcomers? In order to shed light on this rather broad question three dimensions were singled out focusing on the overall principles, the relation between rights and duties in the applied activation approaches and how activation is linked to settlement and naturalization requirements.|$|R

40|$|Results of the {{comparative}} study {{presented in this}} paper suggests that local government organization influences land-use planning, and local development strategies and disparities. Local government reforms can, therefore, serve to modify spatial patterns of development and disparities. Based on a review of studies made in the developed and the developing world, the author provides a comparative perspective on these influences. Five major dimensions of local government organization—territorial, <b>functional,</b> political <b>autonomy,</b> fiscal, and electoral—are used to define four extreme models of local government. The American self-government model leads to substantial inequalities and to considerable sprawl. The Western welfare-state model alleviates these problems somewhat, but at a cost to central government. Its positive impact is also dependent on norms of administration at the central level, whereas reduced competition over economic development has its negative sides. Developing-world-type centralism has no real advantages in terms of development or disparities. The developing-world decentralized model can be regarded as a transitional phase towards either the self-government or the welfare-state models. Its implementation has been partial; hence its impact has, so far, been rather small. ...|$|R

The information fed back from the sensorimotor loop into the control architecture {{can be used to}} change different elements of the controller at four different levels: parameters of the control model, the control model itself, the functional organization of the agent and the functional components of the agent. The complexity of such a space of potential conﬁgurations is daunting. The only viable alternative for the agent ?in practical, economical, evolutionary terms? is the reduction of the dimensionality of the conﬁguration space. This reduction is achieved both by functionalisation —or, to be more precise, by interface minimization— and by patterning, i. e. the selection among a predeﬁned set of organisational conﬁgurations. This last analysis let us state the central problem of how autonomy emerges from the integration of the cognitive, emotional and autonomic systems in strict <b>functional</b> terms: <b>autonomy</b> is achieved by the closure of functional dependency. In this paper we will show a general model of how the emotional biological systems operate following this theoretical analysis and how this model is also of applicability to a wide spectrum of artiﬁcial systems...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} events in the late 1980 s, such as the process of market globalization, the birth of virtual economy, the {{decrease}} in interest rates, made banks develop a sort of schizophrenic view of the market: on one side, in a scenario of globalization, they wanted to have contacts with international markets, in a logic which should have {{put an end to the}} geography of markets (R. O’Brien 1992); on the other side, during the 1990 s, banks felt there were strong information asymmetries between suppliers and beneficiaries of funds. Because these asymmetries increased with geographical distance, banks felt the need to specialize and find their own place in the territory or, in other words, the need to pay attention to local economy. Moreover, at the beginning of 2000, the big banks had to admit that the profits derived from the management of savings, had consistently been reduced because of the crash in stock markets and the financial crisis of some Latin American countries and industrial giants like Enron, World Com. and Parmalat-Cirio. To these events it must be added the great crisis of 2008 yet existent. The brief arguments of these pages, regarding the phenomenon of globalization in real economy and the changes occurred in the financial intermediary sector, imply that one of the focal points for social, economic and cultural development in Europe and above all in Italy today is shaping the relationship between the banking system and territory, i. e. business, local and <b>functional</b> <b>autonomies</b> and socio-cultural actors. The philosophy that inspires the local bank is the awareness of being a firm, supporting other firms in their development, and grows together with the economic area where it operates. The local bank will be able to carry out the task of reducing the risk of the lack of information, which is fundamental for the development of the territory, because it is a well -rooted local institution serving the local community [...] Finally, it is argued that the territorial banks adopting an organizational structure characterized by a decision-making centre, rather than different centres (as is the case for banks to medium/large) can better to use and to encode sensitive information and qualitative than bigger banks. The territorial continuity between the creditor and the debtor allows the first to have at, no cost, a large amount of information, reducing informational asymmetries (Sharpe, 1990) and reducing the phenomenon of credit rationing (undergone primarily by small businesses) and at the same time the Bank sufferings. The contribution tries to find a confirmation of claims exhibit, by conducting an empirical analysis which has as reference Italian credit institutions “popular banks” and “cooperative credit banks”...|$|R

50|$|When the Camp David accords were signed, Jordan's King Hussein {{saw it as}} a slap to {{the face}} when Sadat volunteered Jordan's {{participation}} in deciding how <b>functional</b> <b>autonomy</b> would work. More specifically, Sadat effectively said that Jordan would have a role in how the West Bank would be administered. Like the Rabat Summit Resolution, the Camp David Accords circumscribed Jordan's objective to reassert its control over the West Bank. Focusing as it did on Egypt, the Carter administration accepted Sadat's claim that he could deliver Hussein. However, with Arab world opposition building against Sadat, Jordan could not risk accepting the Accords without the support from powerful Arab neighbours, like Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Syria. Hussein consequently felt diplomatically snubbed. One of Carter's regrets was allowing Sadat to claim that he could speak for Hussein if Jordan refused to join the talks, but by then the damage was done to the Jordanians.The Camp David Accords also prompted the disintegration of a united Arab front in opposition to Israel. Egypt's realignment created a power vacuum that Saddam Hussein of Iraq, at one time only a secondary power, hoped to fill. Because of the vague language concerning the implementation of Resolution 242, the Palestinian problem became the primary issue in the Arab-Israeli conflict immediately following the Camp David Accords (and, arguably, until today). Many of the Arab nations blamed Egypt for not putting enough pressure on Israel to deal with the Palestinian problem {{in a way that would}} be satisfactory to them. Syria also informed Egypt that it would not reconcile with the nation unless it abandoned the peace agreement with Israel.|$|E
