5|$|There {{was much}} {{speculation}} {{going into the}} Stakes over Secretariat's bid for the Triple Crown. Since 1948, when Citation achieved the feat, there had been six horses that had won both the <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Derby</b> and the Preakness Stakes before failing in the Belmont Stakes. When comparing Secretariat to those six horses' health and fitness before the Belmont Stakes, writer Bonifice felt Secretariat {{was in the best}} shape, almost as good as when he entered the <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Derby</b> weeks prior. Just days before the Belmont, Secretariat ran five furlongs in just under a minute in a morning workout. Following that, Secretariat's jockey Ron Turcotte told reporters that Secretariat was ready for a top charge on Saturday.|$|E

5|$|The {{victory in}} the Stakes, when {{combined}} with Secretariat's previous victories in the <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Derby</b> and the Preakness Stakes, meant he completed the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing.

5|$|Between the <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Derby</b> and the Preakness, Mr. Prospector, Cup Bearer, Ecole Etage, Champagne Charlie, and Step Nicely, none of {{whom had}} run in the Derby, were all named as {{possible}} entrants. Three horses, Secretariat, Sham, and Our Native, all raced in the <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Derby</b> two weeks prior. On May 15, seven owners confirmed their intentions to enter their horses by paying a US$1,000 deposit. The horses officially registered that day were Our Native, Secretariat, and Sham, along with new runners Deadly Dream, Ecole Etage, The Lark Twist, and Torsion. A day later, Deadly Dream's trainer stated that he was unsure about racing his colt because he felt the horse could not match Secretariat, Sham, or Our Native. In addition, The Lark Twist's owner Larry Boyce scratched his horse from the race because he received word that Our Native registered, dropping {{the total number of}} horses competing to six. However, on the 17th, Boyce attempted to re-enter The Lark Twist, but was denied under the Rules of Racing of Maryland which stated that the scratching of a horse was irreversible. An Associated Press article commented that the credentials of Secretariat and Sham could lead to the running being one of the smallest since 1964.|$|E
5|$|Borislow's most {{successful}} horse was Toccet, who won four graded stakes, including the Champagne and Hollywood Futurity in 2002. Toccet's {{name is a}} misspelled tribute to former National Hockey League (NHL) player Rick Tocchet. The horse was named runner-up to Vindication for the American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt in 2002, {{a part of the}} Eclipse Award. Once a favorite to enter the 2003 <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Derby,</b> Toccet was derailed by ankle injuries early in the year. He won one listed stakes after his juvenile season out of 15 starts and now stands at Castleton Lyons.|$|E
5|$|Smith's net worth, {{including}} {{real estate}} and stocks and bonds, was $3,250,000, and as he had no will his estate was divided equally among his mother, brother, nephew (James McGill) and niece (Eleanor Ewing). William Smith and James McGill later moved to Indianapolis in 1913 after purchasing the Indianapolis Baseball Club for $150,000. George Smith, the 1916 <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Derby</b> winner, was named after Pittsburgh Phil because he had once owned the colt's dam, Consuelo II. His racing Maxims, gleaned from his only interview with Edward Cole {{a few years before}} his death, are still considered valid by modern handicappers.|$|E

5|$|Three {{weeks after}} the Preakness, the Belmont Stakes {{featured}} a five-horse field. Secretariat won by 31 lengths {{with a time of}} 2:24 for the mile and a half, both course records in their own right. Through his combined victories at the Belmont Stakes, Preakness Stakes, and <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Derby,</b> Secretariat became the ninth horse to complete the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing, and the first horse since Citation in 1948, ending a 25-year period without a Triple Crown winner. Secretariat's times in all three Triple Crown races were stakes records and still stand to this day.|$|E
5|$|After Oxbow's maiden win, he {{was flown}} to Hollywood Park in California {{to run in}} the Grade I CashCall Futurity at a mile and one-sixteenth (1,700m) on a {{synthetic}} surface.

He ran close to the front throughout the race, despite losing ground by being four horses wide around the first turn and three wide around the final turn. Oxbow finished fourth, nine lengths back, but earned his first Road to the <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Derby</b> point, and a speed figure of 87.|$|E
5|$|Following the Belmont, he was {{returned}} to Churchill Downs to rest, beginning to jog on the track the following Friday.

A crowd of 30,000 people showed up to see him as he was hand-walked for about 45 minutes in front of the grandstand and in the paddock. Zayat, Baffert and Espinoza were also given their permanent keepsake <b>Kentucky</b> <b>Derby</b> and Triple Crown trophies in a ceremony that evening. American Pharoah's popularity was so high that his win made the cover of Sports Illustrated, he was photographed for Vogue, and during the NBA Playoffs, the coach of the Golden State Warriors, Steve Kerr, suggested that American Pharoah was the only athlete better than LeBron James.|$|E

5000|$|Pressured by Rock Hard Ten to {{the inside}} and Eddington to the outside, Smarty Jones ran the third quarter-mile in 23 seconds while the fourth quarter went in :23.
