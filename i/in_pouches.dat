5|$|The addax are amply {{suited to}} live in the deep desert under extreme conditions. They can survive without free water almost indefinitely, because they get {{moisture}} from their food and dew that condenses on plants. Scientists believe the addax has a special lining in its stomach that stores water <b>in</b> <b>pouches</b> to use in times of dehydration. They also produce highly concentrated urine to conserve water. Pale colour of the coat reflects radiant heat, and the length and density of the coat helps in thermoregulation. In the day the addax huddle together in shaded areas, and in cool nights rest in sand hollows. These practices help in dissipation of body heat and saving water by cooling the body through evaporation.|$|E

[...] A few years later, he is wearing more fashionable spectacles but Jenkins notes that {{he still has a}} curiously fishlike ("piscine") countenance. [...] He has a propensity to put on weight; although barely 30, Widmerpool appears to Jenkins as portly and middle-aged. [...] At the outbreak of war in 1939, in a badly cut army uniform, he resembles a music-hall burlesque of a military officer or else [...] "a railway official of some obscure country". After the war as an MP, his [...] demeanour and shape are [...] "demanding of treatment by political cartoonists". In 1958, meeting Widmerpool (then in his mid-fifties) after some years, Jenkins is shocked by his elderly appearance. His clothes are ill-fitting through weight loss, giving him the look of a scarecrow; his grey hair is sparse and his facial flesh hangs <b>in</b> <b>pouches.</b> The final glimpse of Widmerpool, in his cult milieu, reveals him as a physical wreck, looking aged, desperate and worn out.|$|E

40|$|Tritrichomonas foetus has {{recently}} {{been identified as a}} cause of chronic diarrhoea in young cats. Up until recently, there was no effective treatment for T. foetus infection in cats. Recently, they have found that ronidazole (30 - 50 mg/kg q 24 h) for 14 days results in longterm elimination of T. foetus infection. Because of the serious adverse effects of ronidazole, a successfully diagnostic method is very important. The specific aims of the present study were to compare the different diagnostic methods (PCR at feces, fecal culture <b>in</b> the <b>In</b> <b>Pouch</b> TF® medium and PCR at <b>In</b> <b>Pouch</b> TF® medium), to determine the detection limits of our PCR and to determine the shedding pattern of the parasite through longitudinal follow­up study of infected cats. Based on the results of our study, we can conclude that PCR at <b>In</b> <b>Pouch</b> TF® medium is the most sensitive diagnostic method for detection of a T. foetus infection. Based on a comparison of the different diagnostic methods, we concluded a relative efficacy for the detection of T. foetus organisms to be as follows: PCR at feces < fecal culture <b>in</b> <b>In</b> <b>Pouch</b> TF® medium < PCR at <b>In</b> <b>Pouch</b> TF® medium. Results of our longitudinal follow­up study have shown that we can not detect T. foetus by PCR assay in all collected fecal samples and that we can speak of intermittent shedding of the parasite in measurable levels by PCR at feces. The absolute detection limit of our real­time PCR was 10 organisms per 200 μl, the practical detection limit in feces we can not determine in our study, while the practical detection limit <b>in</b> <b>In</b> <b>Pouch</b> TF® medium sediment was 10 organisms per 200 μl...|$|R

40|$|Background: In recent years, {{trichomoniasis}} {{has emerged}} as the most common sexually transmitted disease and limited data are available on the effective screening technique for the diagnosis of Trichomonas vaginalis. Aim : The aim was to compare and evaluate different diagnostic methods like wet mount microscopy, <b>In</b> <b>Pouch</b> TV culture, and Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to establish which method or combination of methods was most effective for detection of Trichomonas vaginalis in vaginal swab specimens. Settings and Design : This is a cross-sectional study. Materials and Methods : A total of 200 patients complaining of vaginal discharge were included in the study. Three vaginal swabs were screened for trichomoniasis by wet mount microscopy, <b>In</b> <b>Pouch</b> TV culture system and PCR, using TVK 3 and TVK 7 specific primers. Results : Of the 200 cases studied, 36 (18 %) were positive by wet mount microscopy, 44 (22 %) by <b>In</b> <b>Pouch</b> TV culture system and 60 (30 %) by PCR. Sensitivity and specificity of wet mount were 60 % and 100 %, respectively, whereas sensitivity and specificity of the <b>In</b> <b>Pouch</b> TV culture system were 73. 33 % and 100 %, respectively when compared to PCR. Conclusion : Comparison of different methods showed that at least two techniques, such as wet mount microscopy and culture {{have a better chance of}} detection of T. vaginalis infection. Diagnosis of trichomoniasis by PCR was found to be highly specific and sensitive, but its availability and cost effectiveness limit its use in routine diagnostic laboratories...|$|R

Ascorbic acid was also determined <b>in</b> raw, <b>pouched</b> and canned Royal Ann cherries immediately after processing and after storage for six months at room temperature. Five replicates of green beans and three replicates of cherries were assayed. Compared to the raw green beans, the blanched green beans were higher in apparent thiamin and lower in ascorbic acid. There was significantly more thiamin and ascorbic acid <b>in</b> the <b>pouched</b> green beans and more ascorbic acid <b>in</b> the <b>pouched</b> cherries than <b>in</b> the canned ones. There were no significant losses in these two vitamins <b>in</b> the <b>pouched</b> and canned products after four months storage at room temperature. These vitamins, however, were significantly lower <b>in</b> the <b>pouched</b> and canned products after four months storage at 37. 8 °C. The liquid portions of the pouched products had significantly higher concentrations of these water soluble vitamins than the canned ones. However, {{the total amount of}} liquid portion was lower <b>in</b> the <b>pouched</b> than <b>in</b> the canned products, leading to smaller total vitamin losses <b>in</b> the <b>pouched</b> products. Canned green beans were yellower and lighter <b>in</b> color than <b>pouched</b> green beans. Pouched cherries were significantly darker red than the canned cherries.

40|$|Dried {{roots of}} the plants Acanthopanax senticosus, Angelica sinensis and Scutellaria baicalensis are used in {{traditional}} oriental medicine and reportedly possess anti-inflammatory properties. Using the murine air pouch model of inflammation, we investigated the efficacy and mode of action of an extract from these three plants in crystal-induced inflammation. Air pouches were raised {{on the backs of}} 8 -week-old BALB/c mice. Mice were fed 100 mg/kg body weight of root extracts (A. senticosus:A. sinensis:S. baicalensis mixed in a ratio of 5 : 4 : 1 by weight) or vehicle only on days 3 – 6. Inflammation was elicited on day 6 by injecting 2 mg of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals into the pouch. Neutrophil density and IL- 6 and TNF-α mRNA levels were determined <b>in</b> the <b>pouch</b> membrane, and the leukocyte count and IL- 6, prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) and prostaglandin D 2 (PGD 2) levels were determined <b>in</b> the <b>pouch</b> exudate. Treatment with the root extracts led to a reduction in all inflammatory parameters: the leukocyte count <b>in</b> the <b>pouch</b> exudate decreased by 82 %; the neutrophil density <b>in</b> the <b>pouch</b> membrane decreased by 68 %; IL- 6 and TNF-α mRNA levels <b>in</b> the <b>pouch</b> membrane decreased by 100 %; the IL- 6 concentration <b>in</b> the <b>pouch</b> fluid decreased by 50 %; and the PGE 2 concentration <b>in</b> the <b>pouch</b> fluid decreased by 69 %. Remarkably, the concentration of the potentially anti-inflammatory PGD 2 rose 5. 2 -fold <b>in</b> the <b>pouch</b> exudate (p < 0. 005), which led to a normalization of the PGD 2 :PGE 2 ratio.

40|$|Streptococcal {{cell wall}} fragments, {{suspended}} in phosphate-buffered saline, were injected into a preformed subcutaneous air <b>pouch</b> <b>in</b> rats. The {{advantage of the}} air pouch model is the capacity for quantitation of exudative, cellular, and proliferative responses and soluble mediators. Accumulation of pouch fluid containing many leukocytes occurred during the first 3 days. Granulation tissue separable from the surrounding subcutaneous tissue developed by 6 days. Immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase staining showed the presence of cell walls in inflammatory cells both <b>in</b> <b>pouch</b> fluid and <b>in</b> <b>pouch</b> tissue. Histologic features of this inflammation included an acute exudative phase with a predominantly neutrophil infiltration followed by a chronic phase characterized by fibroblast proliferation, formation of blood vessels, and infiltration with mononuclear cells. The lining of the pouch before injection of cell wall developed morphologic features of synovial membrane, which became more evident during the chronic phase of induced inflammation. Outbred Sprague-Dawley and inbred Lewis rats developed more pouch fluid, cell numbers <b>in</b> the <b>pouch</b> fluid, and granulation tissue than inbred Buffalo rats. The arachidonic acid metabolites, prostaglandin E 2 and leukotriene B 4, were measured <b>in</b> the <b>pouch</b> fluid, and more of each was produced in the Lewis than in the Buffalo strain. These measurements of inflammation {{are consistent with the}} relative susceptibility of these strains to cell-wall-induced arthritis.
