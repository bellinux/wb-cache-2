50|$|The {{diesel engine}} is an English Electric 6-cylinder, 4-stroke, 6KT and the {{traction}} motors are two EE506 axle-hung, nose-suspended, force-ventilated traction motors with 17.5:1 double reduction gear drive. The main generator is an EE type EE801/7D, <b>flange-mounted</b> single bearing rated at 490 kW.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flange-mounted</b> steel barrels were {{bolted to}} the {{crankcase}} and enclosed with cast aluminium alloy, screwed-on, cylinder head with integral cooling fins. The pistons were also made of aluminium alloy and had floating gudgeon pins. The nine pistons drove the single throw crankshaft via one channel-section master rod and eight circular section auxiliary rods. The master rod had an integral, split type big-end. The crankshaft was machined from a single forging, with bolt-on balance weights.|$|E
50|$|A rail vehicle, {{particularly}} a locomotive, possesses numerous subsystems {{that require a}} separate electrically separated speed signal. There usually are neither enough mounting places nor is there sufficient space where separate pulse generators could be installed. Multichannel pulse generators that are <b>flange-mounted</b> onto the bearing shells or covers of wheelsets offer a solution. Using a number of bearingless speed sensors would also involve additional cables, which should preferably be avoided for outdoor equipment {{because they are so}} susceptible to damage, for instance from flying track ballast.|$|E
50|$|Nikkors {{constitute}} {{the majority of}} lenses available for the Nikon F-mount, which is itself the largest system of interchangeable <b>flange-mount</b> photographic lenses in history. These lenses are designed for the 135 (35mm) and Nikon DX formats. Over 400 different F-mount Nikkor models are known to exist.|$|R
50|$|The Nikon F-mount {{is one of}} {{only two}} SLR lens mounts (the other being the Pentax K-mount) which were not {{abandoned}} by their associated manufacturer upon the introduction of autofocus, but rather extended to meet new requirements related to metering, autofocus, and aperture control. The large variety of F-mount compatible lenses makes it the largest system of interchangeable <b>flange-mount</b> photographic lenses in history. Over 400 different Nikkor lenses are compatible with the system (others details {{can be found at the}} Nikkor The Thousand and One Nights site). The F-mount is also popular in scientific and industrial applications, most notably machine vision. The F-mount has been in production for over five decades, making it the only SLR lens mount which has been produced for over 50 years.|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{performance}} of a new miniature cylindrical mirror analyzer (CMA) are presented. The CMA comprises outer and inner cylinders, an integral on-axis electron gun, and a detector system consisting of ring aperture and channeltron, all mounted on a single 2. 75 in. (70 mm o. d.) Conflat flange. Entrance angle, sample-to-detector distance, and polar cone angle were chosen, in consideration of second order focusing effects, which optimized analyzer transparency and resolution. Fringe field correction {{at the ends of}} the CMA is made by means of six rings precisely separated by sapphire insulators. The electron gun is a one-lens electrostatic system equipped with an x-y deflector for beam adjustment and scanning. A CeB 6 low temperature cathode operating at up to - 3. 0 keV delivers emission current up to 100 muA. The energy range of analyzed electrons can be varied between 0 eV and 3. 0 keV. The flange mounting also incorporates a high precision z-motion drive for optimization of the working distance. The control electronics and software permit operation of the instrument in pulse and analog phase sensitive detection modes. Results obtained with this new mini CMA for a W(100) surface demonstrate an energy resolution (DeltaE/E) of 0. 9 %, which is comparable to larger 6 in. (152 mm) <b>flange-mounted</b> instruments. The very small size of the mini CMA permits its use in small or crowded ultrahigh vacuum chambers or where only 2. 75 in. ports are available, thereby increasing flexibility in surface analysis.
