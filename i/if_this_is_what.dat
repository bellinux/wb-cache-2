500|$|Whitney {{initially}} left {{management of}} the newspaper to Walter Thayer, a longtime advisor. Thayer {{did not believe the}} Tribune was a financial investment -- [...] "it was a matter of 'let's set it up so that (Whitney) can do it <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> he wants"—but moved to build a [...] "hen house" [...] of media properties to protect Whitney's investment and provide money for the Tribune. Over the next two years, Whitney's firm acquired Parade, five television stations and four radio stations. The properties, merged into a new company called Whitney Communications Corporation, proved profitable, but executives chafed at subsidizing the Tribune.|$|E
500|$|In Cobb's view, the {{transfer}} of personnel to the yawl may have been intended as a temporary safety measure. He speculated from Deveau's report {{on the state of}} the rigging and ropes that the ship's main halliard may have been used to attach the yawl to the ship, enabling the company to return on board when the danger had passed. If, however, the line had subsequently parted, Mary Celeste would have sailed away empty leaving the yawl to founder with its occupants. Begg notes the illogicality of attaching the yawl to a vessel that the crew thought was about to explode or sink, while the modern writer Macdonald Hastings asks whether Briggs, an experienced captain, would have effected a panicky abandonment of the ship when, [...] "If the Mary Celeste had blown her timbers, she would still have been a better bet for survival than the ship's boat." [...] <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> happened, says Hastings, Briggs [...] "...behaved like a fool; worse, a frightened one." ...|$|E

500|$|In August 2014, it was {{confirmed}} that producers had planned a romance storyline for Mark and his housemate Paige Smith (Olympia Valance). After growing closer, they realised {{that they had}} a deeper connection than friendship. They later agreed to go out for dinner, but neither of them called it a date. Mark struggled with the idea of moving on from Kate, and even though he knew it was a date, he had not admitted it out loud. Mark ignored Paige afterwards, causing her to confront him as a storm hit Erinsborough. Brennan and Paige then consummated their relationship. Their first official date ended abruptly when Paige turned up wearing an old dress of Kate's she found in a charity shop. Brennan reacted angrily and shouted at Paige to leave the bar. He later realised that he had been too harsh, but just as he decided to give their relationship another go, he saw her kissing another man. McGregor commented [...] "He thinks he's blown his chances with her – but he's also wondering <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> he really wants." ...|$|E
500|$|Closing out the year, My Name Is My Name {{was named}} to {{multiple}} [...] "Best Albums of the Year" [...] lists. It was ranked at number 33 on Rolling Stones list of the 50 best albums of 2013. They commented saying, [...] "The cockier half of the Clipse didn't choose to go solo — he had to after his brother found God. Pusha, in turn, found Kanye West, whose stark and twisted production helped make My Name Is My Name feel like a more lyrically focused companion piece to his own Yeezus. It's the year's sharpest hit of street philosophy." [...] Complex named it the third best album of 2013. They elaborated saying, [...] "everything clicks {{because of the way}} it was calculated. The songs benefit from their respective placement beside each other, each track a background for the next. In that way, it brings the Pusha T fan up to speed with what he's evolved into, without leaving them in unfamiliar territory. If you were the reluctant [...] "we want that old Pusha T" [...] fan, then it fed you the teaspoon of updated classic with the medicine of his reinvention—and by the end, you appreciated both sides." [...] Nick Catucci of Entertainment Weekly named it the eighth best album of 2013 saying, [...] "With these beats — private-stash stuff from the likes of his label boss Kanye West and Pharrell Williams — he could sell fire in hell. In fact, Pusha plumbs his emotional depths, breaking down his parents' divorce after 35 years of marriage and his conflicted feelings about his brother." [...] Exclaim! named it the second best hip hop album of 2013. XXL named it the fourth best album of 2013. They commented saying, [...] "Song for song, it's tough to put any album in the same category as Pusha's proper solo debut. In the space of a trim 46 minutes, Push coaxed the best verse of Rick Ross' year on [...] "Hold On," [...] made Kendrick Lamar get dark and grim on [...] "Nosetalgia" [...] and even rapped over a beat that seemed impossible to make into a hip-hop track on [...] "King Push," [...] all while keeping his lyricism at the absolute highest level.

2500|$|Outside of the {{transsexual}} {{community and}} sexology researchers, this controversy is largely notable {{because of its}} implications for academic freedom and freedom of speech. [...] In an interview with The New York Times, Dreger said, [...] "If we're going to have research at all, then we're going to have people saying unpopular things, and <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> happens to them, then we've got problems not only for science but free expression itself."

While he admitted that the [...] "notes for the guidance of the faithful" [...] that Cardinal Ratzinger mentioned as still valid in his letter to Bishop Boland were severe condemnations, he saw in the request that a disclaimer of supernatural origin be inserted in the volumes an implicit permission to publish them if accompanied by that disclaimer.

2500|$|The book {{elicited}} both strongly {{supportive and}} strongly negative reactions. The controversial aspects included {{the contents of}} the book, whether the research was conducted ethically, whether it should have been published by the National Academies Press, and whether it should have been promoted as a scientific work. According to Benedict Carey's story in The New York Times, [...] "To many of Dr. Bailey’s peers, his story is a morality play about the corrosive effects of political correctness on academic freedom." [...] Interviewed by Carey, bioethicist Alice Dreger argues that [...] "what happened to Bailey is important, because the harassment was so extraordinarily bad and because it could happen to any researcher in the field.

2500|$|The {{following}} track, [...] "Staying Alive", {{was written}} and produced by Jay R Sillona and Keith Martin under Sillona's own recording label, Homeworkz Records. The song uses Auto-Tune, and features rap verses by Q-York and additional back-up vocals by beauty queen Krista Kleiner, who was Sillona's {{partner at the}} time. It marked {{the second time that}} Nina collaborated with Sillona, since their duet of [...] "Muli" [...] in early 2010. The song is described as [...] "another smoking track with bold and powerful lyrics: 'I shouldn't let them knock me down down down... I'm staying alive.'" [...] "However Much Love" [...] is an acoustic flute-driven song, considered as one of Nina's distinctly slow and sentimental ballads in the album. The lyrics speak of steadfast and unconditional love. Philippine Entertainment Portal called it a [...] "standout," [...] stating [...] "Nina's voice heightens the pain and vulnerability evoked by the lyrics and melody." [...] "Believe in the Dream" [...] is an inspirational power ballad, written by Jude Gitamondoc. Nina insisted the song's inclusion with the purpose of encouraging her listeners to pursue their goals despite adversities. Its message is about not giving up on your dreams. Nina related the lyrics to her personal struggles, saying [...] "That's important for me because I, really, almost gave up [...] <b>If</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> you always wanted to do, if this is your dream, don't lose hope. Go for it. Me, I almost gave up and if not for my faith and belief in God, I would have lost the hope that was left. So, just really keep on reaching for your dreams." ...|$|E
2500|$|Statements of {{equitable}} principle stretch {{back to the}} Ancient Greeks in {{the work}} of Aristotle, while examples of rules analogous to trusts were found in the Roman law testamentary institution of the fideicommissum, and the Islamic proprietary institution of the Waqf. [...] However, English trusts law is a largely indigenous development that began in the Middle Ages, {{from the time of the}} 11th and 12th century crusades. After William the Conqueror became King in 1066, one [...] "common law" [...] of England was created. Common law courts regarded property as an indivisible entity, as it had been under Roman law and continental versions of civil law. During the crusades, landowners who went to fight would transfer title to their land to a person they trusted so that feudal services could be performed and received. But many who returned found that the people they entrusted refused to transfer their title deed back. Sometimes, common law courts would not acknowledge that anybody had rights in the property except the holder of the legal title deeds. So claimants petitioned the King to sidestep the common law courts. The King delegated hearing of petitions to his Lord Chancellor, who established the Court of Chancery as more cases were heard. Where it appeared [...] "inequitable" [...] (i.e. unfair) to let someone with legal title hold onto land, the Lord Chancellor could declare that the real owner [...] "in equity" [...] (i.e. in all fairness) was another person, <b>if</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> good conscience dictated. The Court of Chancery determined that the true [...] "use" [...] or [...] "benefit" [...] of property did not belong to the person on the title (or the feoffee who held seisin). The cestui que use, the owner in equity, could be a different person. So English law recognised a split between legal and equitable owner, between someone who controlled title and another for whose benefit the land would be used. It was the beginning of trust law. The same logic was useful for Franciscan friars, who would transfer title of land to others as they were precluded from holding property by their vows of poverty. When the courts said that one person's legal title to property was subject to an obligation to use that property for another person, there was a trust.|$|E
