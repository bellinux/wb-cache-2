25|$|Under normal conditions, {{language}} {{seems to}} develop {{in a similar way}} among all children but when children <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> radically different environment their language is significantly different. A number of examples including wild children show that certain elements of the early environment are essential for language learning. Amala and Kamala and Genie never managed to fully progress to learning language. While these examples are extreme, they show that consumer’s language is affected by their environment. This is especially true of marketing activities across geographical borders.|$|E
40|$|This {{exploratory}} study compared selected HIV/STD-related risk variables (sexual behavior, condom use, STD diagnosis, and beliefs) between adults who <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> rural area {{and those who}} <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> non-rural area. Participants were recruited through an electronic mailing list of a large, internet-based sexual enhancement product company and completed a web-based questionnaire. A sample comprising 123 rural {{men and women and}} 1131 non–rural men and women, ages 18 to 39 years, were analyzed. No significant differences were found for any of the variables between those who <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> rural area compared to those who <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> non-rural area, although both groups reported HIV/STD risk behaviors. Hence, prevention education efforts appear justified in rural, as well urban area...|$|R

25|$|Kravitz {{was born}} in Manhattan, New York, {{the only child of}} actress Roxie Roker (1929–1995) and NBC {{television}} news producer Sy Kravitz. His father was from a Jewish family (with origins from Ukraine; see the Kravits surname). His mother was of Bahamian and African-American descent, and was from a Christian family. Kravitz is the cousin (once removed) of television weather presenter Al Roker. During his early years, Kravitz did not <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> religious environment. After a spiritual experience when he was 13, he started attending church, becoming a non-denominational Christian.|$|E
500|$|Families {{vary widely}} {{in terms of}} how {{household}} chores are divided. Some retired males who marry a younger woman decide to become stay-at-home dads while their wives work because they want a [...] "second chance" [...] to watch a child <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> second or third marriage. Additionally, more career and lifestyle options are accepted and prevalent in Western society. There are also fewer restrictions on what constitutes a family.|$|E

500|$|At {{the time}} of the commission's vote in January, the {{boardroom}} was crowded with people who held some kind of interest in the issue. Busloads of churchgoers arrived {{from as far away as}} Homestead and picketed outside; there was no corresponding organized show of support for the ordinance. Inside the boardroom, supporters and opposers took the entire allotted time to speak. Bryant reflected most of those opposing the law, telling the Dade County Commission, [...] "The ordinance condones immorality and discriminates against my children's rights to <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> healthy, decent community". The few members of the Dade County Coalition for the Humanistic Rights of Gays who were present were stunned, as was Ruth Shack, at the number and force of the hundreds of protesters who filled the commission room, and held placards and pickets outside. But the ordinance passed by a 5-3 vote.|$|E
500|$|Although she {{has been}} criticised by SNP {{politicians}} for taking a [...] "Blairite" [...] stance on public services, The Guardians Peter Hetherington has described Lamont as [...] "rooted to older [...] party values, with a deep commitment to fairness". Her politics were heavily influenced by her inner city upbringing and her career in teaching. Her childhood experience was something she addressed in an emotional speech to delegates at the 2013 Scottish Labour Party Conference: [...] "I saw in my upbringing the beauty of our land and felt both the warmth of community and the harshness and brutality at times {{of trying to make}} a living here. I had the privilege to <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> family of love, but one where my mother always reminded me that what we ate, what we wore, where we lived, was all the product of the sweat of my father's brow earned at sea.

500|$|There {{were many}} {{different}} versions of the Catholic story, but all followed the same basic structure. All had Edgardo quickly and fervently embracing Christianity and trying {{to learn as much as}} possible about it. Most described a dramatic scene of Edgardo wondering at a painting of the Virgin Mary in sorrow, either in Rome or during the journey from Bologna. [...] Agostini, the policeman who had escorted him to Rome, reported that the boy had at first stubbornly refused to enter a church with him for mass, but displayed an apparently miraculous transformation when he did. A common theme was that Edgardo had become a kind of prodigy—according to an eyewitness account published in the Catholic L'armonia della religione colla civiltà, he had learned the catechism perfectly within a few days, [...] "blesse the servant who baptised him," [...] and declared that he wanted to convert all Jews to Christianity. The most influential pro-Church article on Mortara was an account published in the Jesuit periodical La Civiltà Cattolica in November 1858, and subsequently reprinted or quoted in Catholic papers across Europe. This story had the child begging the rector of the Catechumens not to send him back but to let him <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Christian home, and initiated what became a central plank of the pro-Church narrative—that Edgardo had a new family, namely the Catholic Church itself. The article quoted Edgardo as saying: [...] "I am baptised; I am baptised and my father is the Pope." ...|$|E

Mondale called her [...] "a remarkable woman and a dear human being... She was a pioneer in our country for justice for women and a more open society. She broke a lot of molds and it's a better country for what she did." [...] George H. W. Bush said, [...] "Though we were one-time political opponents, I am happy to say Gerry and I became friends in time – a friendship marked by respect and affection. I admired Gerry in many ways, {{not the least of which}} was the dignified and principled manner she blazed new trails for women in politics." [...] Palin paid tribute to her on Facebook, expressing gratitude for having been able to work with her the year before and saying, [...] "She broke one huge barrier and then went on to break many more. May her example of hard work and dedication to America continue to inspire all women." [...] Bill and Hillary Clinton said in a statement that, [...] "Gerry Ferraro was one of a kind – tough, brilliant, and never afraid to speak her mind or stand up for what she believed in – a New York icon and a true American original." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{families}} go overseas, {{minority students}} rarely experience overt racism from their expatriate neighbors.

The bonds of the military community are normally seen by military dependents as being stronger bonds than the differences of race.

2500|$|Psychiatrist Colin Ross {{calls his}} model, [...] "trauma model of mental disorders", which {{addresses}} comorbidity of trauma with other mental disorders. Ross describes the theoretical {{basis of his}} trauma model as common sense: [...] "The problem faced by many patients is {{that they did not}} <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> reasonably healthy, normal family. They grew up in an inconsistent, abusive and traumatic family. The very people to whom the child had to attach for survival, were also abuse perpetrators and hurt him or her badly.... The basic conflict, the deepest pain, and the deepest source of symptoms, is the fact that mom and dad's behavior hurts, did not fit together, and did not make sense." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{economic}} {{disparities between}} some classes of European Americans and African Americans have diminished.

African Americans occupy a higher percentage of high-paying jobs within the USA than they used to. [...] This has led to a rapidly increasing black upper-middle class. Many of America's suburbs are becoming diversified with black and white residents coexisting in affluent neighborhoods. With the economic division within similar classes declining between races, African-American movement to the suburbs has resulted in some suburbs becoming more diverse. [...] Other times middle and upper class blacks have chosen to settle in chiefly African-American communities, so their children can <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> strong community of their own.|$|E
