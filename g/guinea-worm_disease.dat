25|$|Dracunculiasis, {{also called}} <b>Guinea-worm</b> <b>disease</b> (GWD), is an {{infection}} by the Guinea worm. A person becomes infected when they drink water that contains water fleas infected with guinea worm larvae. Initially {{there are no}} symptoms. About one year later, the person develops a painful burning feeling as the female worm forms a blister in the skin, usually on a lower limb. The worm then emerges from the skin {{over the course of}} a few weeks. During this time, it may be difficult to walk or work. It is very uncommon for the disease to cause death.|$|E

5000|$|Dracunculiasis is {{also known}} as <b>Guinea-worm</b> <b>disease.</b> There were 126 cases of {{dracunculiasis}} in 2014, a decrease from 542 cases in 2012, and a substantial decrease from 3,500,000 cases in 1986. [...] It is not fatal, but can cause months of inactivity. [...] It is caused by drinking water contaminated by water fleas infected with guinea-worm larvae. Approximately one year after infection, a painful blister forms and one or more worm emerges. Worms can be up to one meter long.|$|E

5000|$|Twenty {{neglected}} tropical {{diseases are}} prioritized by WHO, though other organizations define NTDs differently. Chromoblastomycosis and other deep mycoses, scabies and other ectoparasites and snakebite envenoming {{were added to}} the list in 2017. These diseases are common in 149 countries, affecting more than 1.4 billion people (including more than 500 million children) and costing developing economies billions of dollars every year. They resulted in 142,000 deaths in 2013—down from 204,000 deaths in 1990. [...] Of these 17, two were targeted for eradication (dracunculiasis (<b>guinea-worm</b> <b>disease)</b> by 2015 and yaws by 2020), and four for elimination (blinding trachoma, human African trypanosomiasis, leprosy and lymphatic filariasis by 2020).|$|E
40|$|The world {{stands on}} the edge of an {{historic}} public health success with the imminent eradication of dracunculiasis (<b>guinea-worm</b> <b>disease)</b> and polio. Since the World Health Assembly called for the eradication of dracunculiasis in 1986 and poliomyelitis in 1988, astonishing progress has been made. In 2016, only 25 human cases of dracunculiasis were reported from three countries, transmission of wild poliovirus was found in only three countries, and 37 cases of polio were reported worldwide. In addition to these achievements, there has been progress in the elimination of the little-known disease podoconiosis (endemic non-filarial elephantiasis) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the global}} effort to {{eradicate}} dracunculiasis (<b>guinea-worm</b> <b>disease)</b> {{one of the}} main tools is the use of filters for filtering unsafe drinking-water. The expensive and high-quality monofilament nylon filters, which for many years were donated to all dracunculiasis-endemic countries, are now mainly reserved for highly endemic countries. Polyester cloth is less expensive, and we investigated the user acceptability and effectiveness of this material as a drinking-water filter in a dracunculiasis-endemic village in Northern Region, Ghana, over a 3 -month period. The polyester cloth completely retained the stages of copepods that are responsible for transmitting dracunculiasis. Over the 3 -month study period a majority of respondents found that the new cloth was superior to the nylon filter with regard to strength (83 %), filtering time (80 %), and the ease with which the filter could be cleaned (87 %). Inspection revealed that the filters were used intensively and that the new cloth was damaged after 2 - 3 months of use, which is also the case for the monofilament nylon filters...|$|E
40|$|The International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade (1981 - 1990) has stimulated a {{movement}} to eradicate human infection with the helminthic parasite Dracunculus medinensis (dracunculiasis), whose victims are disabled for weeks or months during the painful emergence {{of one or more}} worms from beneath the skin. Each year, millions of people acquire this infection by drinking unclean water. Among the critical activities that are necessary for the elimination of dracunculiasis, one of the most fundamental is that of epidemiological surveillance. Surveillance activities {{play a key role in}} the strategy to target affected villages for improved water supplies and other control activities. Accurate surveillance data also stimulate interest and support for national eradication programmes. Dracunculiasis is a condition with excellent characteristics for reporting through passive surveillance systems. However, active surveillance, as well as other innovative surveillance strategies, should be used to establish baseline information in those villages where cases occur, and later to monitor epidemiologically important indices needed to evaluate the progress of elimination efforts. Human dracunculiasis (<b>guinea-worm</b> <b>disease)</b> is caused by the parasitic worm Dracunculus medinensis. Human infection is acquired only through ingestion o...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey was}} carried out in 2001 to {{ascertain}} the status of Guinea worm disease infection among farm households in Ebonyi Local Government Area (LGA) of Ebonyi State. A total of 3, 777 respondents were randomly sampled from 15 communities that comprised the LGA. The sample respondents were clinically examined and then interviewed with structured questionnaires. Data collected were analyzed using percentages, frequency and ratios. Results of the study revealed that a total of 192 respondents were infected by the disease which gave prevalence rate of 5. 08 %. Majority (54. 15 %) of the infected persons were farmers who were in the prime of their productive lives. It is therefore recommended that portable clean and safe drinking water should be provided to the rural communities in the study area. This requires the assistance of both governments and non-government organizations. Again, awareness campaign should be mounted in the study area to sensitize the rural communities on the prevalence of the disease in their area as well as the necessary precautionary measures to avoid infection of the disease. On the other hand health and agricultural extension workers should educate the rural households on the various safety measures to prevent infection of the disease and/or manage the disease if one becomes infected.

40|$|Organization (WHO) has {{coordinated the}} norms and {{technical}} standards required to improve global health. This {{is the role}} people most often associate with WHO. However, the organization’s constitution also calls on it to “furnish technical assis-tance and, in emergencies, necessary aid” to governments, a role WHO has played on countless occasions. Examples include eradicating smallpox, bringing polio and <b>guinea-worm</b> <b>disease</b> {{to the brink of}} eradi-cation and responding to health threats posed by humanitarian crises worldwide. Despite initial delays in the western Africa Ebola outbreak response, the tide of this unprecedented health crisis has now been turned. While still requiring intense and focused action to bring new cases to zero, the outbreak is now limited to only a few cases per week. Deficien-cies in capacity, expertise and approach revealed by WHO’s response to Ebola suggest that organization-wide change is needed: 1 WHO must ensure it can prepare for and respond to outbreaks and emergencies in a way that genu-inely supports national efforts and fully integrates with international partners. WHO must do more than provide support in emergencies. It must become a fully operational emergency orga-nization. This distinction may sound subtle – but the new course that WHO is charting marks one of the most pro-found shifts in its history. WHO must enable countries to strengthen their outbreak and emergency preparedness, while ensuring that its own experts and those of its partners can rapidly roll out the required response within the first 24 – 72 hours. Subsequently, WHO must support countries in the recovery phase after an outbreak or emergency and help them “build back better ” when health systems have been damaged. To succeed, this will require stronger, more functional linkages and partnerships to allow WHO to prepare and respond more predictably to infectious disease outbreaks and other emergencies. WHO has established a high-level advisory group, 2 chaired by D...|$|E
40|$|The {{study which}} forms {{the subject of}} this volume differs in many respects from a study of the {{geographical}} distribution of more concrete objects, such as certain groups of animals, plants, or minerals. Though constantly spoken of {{as if it were a}} material, tangible entity, disease is, in fact, no such thing. It is only a morbid phenomenon, or rather a group of morbid processes, in the tissues of a particular animal organism. In the language of logic, it is not even a phenomenon, but an epiphenomenon. It is only in that class of diseases known or believed to be of Parasitic origin that there exists, in addition to the group of intangible signs and symptoms which in ordinary language constitute the disease, a tangible, palpable something, the distribution of which over the earth's surface may be justly compared with the distribution of mammals or insects, herbs or trees. But, on the one hand, it has not yet been shown that all, or nearly all, diseases are of this character; and, on the other hand, even where the parasitic origin of a human disease has been proved, it is well to bear in mind that the parasite and the disease are not one and the same thing, nor is their geographical distribution always or of necessity identical. There is good reason to believe, for example, that the parasites which are the known or suspected causes of such diseases as cholera, blackwater fever, malaria, <b>guinea-worm</b> <b>disease,</b> hydatids, and perhaps enteric and other fevers, may and do exist for long periods together outside the human body, and that there are uninhabited or sparsely inhabited tracts of the earth's surface where these parasites remain in the soil, or in water, or in the bodies of the lower animals, and where the human disease associated with them is only set up when man visits those tracts. In other words, the area of distribution of some disease parasites may be wider than the area of distribution of the human disease caused by them. In these instances the disease has a wider distribution potentially than actually. In others the reverse may be the case, and the area of distribution of the disease may at any given moment be actually wider than that of the parasite which gave rise to it. This, however, is exceptional, and can only occur in the case of certain affections of long duration, such, for example, as elephantiasis arabum, where the symptoms of the disease remain long after the filaria or other parasite which first caused them has disappeared from the tissues...|$|E
