40|$|The {{photosynthetic}} cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 {{has recently}} gained great attention {{for its ability}} to directly convert CO 2 into renewable chemicals upon genetic engineering. Thus, it is of great interest to increase the growth speed and lower the medium requirement for cultivating this cyanobacterium. The cultivation medium of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 has been developed, which consists of many inorganic and metal ingredients with a specific composition, known as the BG- 11 medium. In this work, we analyzed the concentration effect of each ingredient and identified the absolutely essential components in BG- 11 medium for cyanobacteria growth using the concentration gradient generator chip (CGGC) fabricated by MEMS technology. As shown by our results, removal of the individual component sodium nitrate, potassium phosphate, or magnesium sulfate from the BG- 11 medium led to severe growth inhibition of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942.

40|$|Nisin, {{produced}} by Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, has {{a broad spectrum}} of activity against gram-positive bacteria and is generally recognized as safe in the United States for use in selected pasteurized cheese spreads to control the outgrowth and toxin production of Clostridium botulinum. This study evaluated the inhibitory activity of nisin in combination with a chelating agent, <b>disodium</b> <b>EDTA,</b> against several Salmonella species and other selected gram-negative bacteria. After a 1 -h exposure to 50 micrograms of nisin per ml and 20 mM <b>disodium</b> <b>EDTA</b> at 37 degrees C, a 3. 2 - to 6. 9 -log-cycle reduction in population was observed with the species tested. Treatment with <b>disodium</b> <b>EDTA</b> or nisin alone produced no significant inhibition (less than 1 -log-cycle reduction) of the Salmonella and other gram-negative species tested. These results demonstrated that nisin is bactericidal to Salmonella species and that the observed inactivation can be demonstrated in other gram-negative bacteria. Applications involving the simultaneous treatment with nisin and chelating agents that alter the outer membrane may be of value in controlling food-borne salmonellae and other gram-negative bacteria...|$|R
