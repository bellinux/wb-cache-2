We report here that glyoxal also reacts with peroxynitrite, yielding formate ion at rates at least 1 order of magnitude greater than does methylglyoxal.

Accordingly, the near-infrared emission increases upon raising the peroxynitrite concentration in D 2 O buffer and is suppressed upon addition of O- 2 ((1) Delta(g)) quenchers (NaN 3, L-His, H 2 O).

Despite being central to many contemporary mechanisms underpinning these chemistries, reports of the direct detection or isolation of phenylperoxyl radicals are rare {{and there is little}} experimental evidence connecting this intermediate with expected product channels. We have prepared and isolated two charge-tagged phenyl radical models in the gas phase [i. e., 4 -(N,N,N-trimethylammonium) phenyl radical cation and 4 -carboxylatophenyl radical anion] and observed their reactions with dioxygen by ion-trap mass spectrometry.

Intramolecular H-abstraction at the methyl group, by a phenoxy radical (reaction c) and subsequent 1, 2 -aryl migration (reaction e) have been proposed to account for this transformation [88, 89]. The 1, 2 -aryl migration product is further converted into o-quinone methide (reaction g), a key intermediate [90, 91], which is subsequently hydrogenated to o-cresol (reaction h). Demethoxylation occurs by α-scission of the <b>formyl</b> <b>radical</b> (reaction l) formed by H-abstraction from o-hydroxybenzaldehyde (reaction k) [88, 92].

In this work, quantum {{chemical}} {{methods are}} used to study the reaction of OH • radicals with formaldehyde bound to the Si(OH) 4 monomer, {{as a model for}} silica mineral aerosols.

40|$|The {{synthetic}} {{routes to}} form acetaldehyde [CH 3 CHO(X(1) A') ] in extraterrestrial ices were investigated experimentally in a contamination-free ultrahigh vacuum scattering machine. Binary ice mixtures {{of carbon monoxide}} [CO(X- 1 Sigma(+)) ] and methane [CH 4 (X(1) A(1)) ] were condensed at 10 K onto a silver monocrystal and irradiated with 5 keV electrons to mimic the electronic energy transfer processes initiated by MeV cosmic-ray particle - induced delta-electrons in the "ultratrack'' of MeV ion trajectories; the carbon monoxide - methane ices served as model compounds to simulate neighboring CO - CH 4 molecules in astrophysical ices, as present in cold molecular clouds and in cometary matter. Upon completion of the high-energy processing, the ice samples sublimed during the heating phase to 293 K, thus releasing the remaining reactants {{as well as the}} newly formed molecules into the gas phase. The experiment was monitored on line and in situ via a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer in absorption-reflection-absorption mode (solid state) and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (gas phase). Our investigations were combined with electronic structure calculations. At 10 K, the primary reaction step involved the cleavage of the carbon-hydrogen bond of the methane molecule via an electronic energy transfer process from the impinging electron to the methane molecule to form a methyl radical [CH 3 (X(2) A(2) '') ] plus a hydrogen atom [H(S- 2 (1 / 2)) ]. The H atom contains the excess energy in the form of translational motion; suprathermal hydrogen atoms can add to the carbon-oxygen triple bond of the carbon monoxide molecule, overcoming the entrance barrier, to yield the <b>formyl</b> <b>radical</b> [HCO(X(2) A') ]. Depending on the reactant geometry inside the matrix cage, the <b>formyl</b> <b>radical</b> recombined barrierlessly with the neighboring methyl radical inside the ices at 10 K. Upon warming of the ice sample, the acetaldehyde molecules sublime into the gas phase. This process mimics the sublimation of molecules from the grain mantles into the gas phase upon the transition of the molecular cloud to the hot molecular core phase. This mechanism to form acetaldehyde inside interstellar ices (cold molecular clouds; 10 K) upon high-energy processing, followed by a radical-radical recombination and sublimation in the hot core phase (molecular cores; few 100 K), presents a compelling route to account for high fractional abundances of acetaldehyde of a few times 10 (- 9) toward star-forming regions, as compared to abundances of only some 10 (- 10) in the cold cloud TMC- 1, where solely gas-phase reactions are supposed to synthesize acetaldehyde...|$|R

That work evidenced two competing C-Cl bond fission channels, tentatively assigning them as producing ground-and excited-state methoxy carbonyl radicals. In this study, we measure the photofragment angular distributions for each C-Cl bond fission channel and the spin-orbit state of the Cl atoms produced. The data shows bond fission leading to the production of ground-state methoxy carbonyl radicals with a high kinetic energy release and an angular distribution characterized by an anisotropy parameter, â, of between 0. 37 and 0. 64. The bond fission that leads to the production of excited-state radicals, with a low kinetic energy release, has an angular distribution best described by a negative anisotropy parameter. The very different angular distributions suggest that two different excited states of methyl chloroformate lead to the formation of ground- and excited-state methoxy carbonyl products. Moreover, with these measurements we were able to refine the product branching fractions to 82 % of the C-Cl bond fission resulting in ground-state radicals and 18 % resulting in excited-state radicals. The maximum kinetic energy release of 12 kcal/mol measured for the channel producing excited...|$|R
40|$|The {{reaction}} of the methylidyne radical (CH) with acetaldehyde (CH 3 CHO) is studied at room temperature and at a pressure of 4 Torr (533. 3 Pa) using a multiplexed photoionization mass spectrometer coupled to the tunable vacuum ultraviolet synchrotron radiation of the Advanced Light Source at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The CH radicals are generated by 248 nm multiphoton photolysis of CHBr 3 and react with acetaldehyde in an excess of helium and nitrogen gas flow. Five reaction exit channels are observed corresponding to elimination of methylene (CH 2), elimination of a <b>formyl</b> <b>radical</b> (HCO), elimination of carbon monoxide (CO), elimination of a methyl radical (CH 3), and elimination of a hydrogen atom. Analysis of the photoionization yields versus photon energy for the {{reaction of}} CH and CD radicals with acetaldehyde and CH radical with partially deuterated acetaldehyde (CD 3 CHO) provides fine details about the reaction mechanism. The CH 2 elimination channel is found to preferentially form the acetyl radical by removal of the aldehydic hydrogen. The insertion of the CH radical into a C–H bond of the methyl group of acetaldehyde is {{likely to lead to}} a C 3 H 5 O reaction intermediate that can isomerize by β-hydrogen transfer of the aldehydic hydrogen atom and dissociate to form acrolein + H or ketene + CH 3, which are observed directly. Cycloaddition of the radical onto the carbonyl group is likely to lead to the formation of the observed products, methylketene, methyleneoxirane, and acrolein...|$|R
40|$|A {{tunable diode}} laser {{infrared}} high-resolution spectrometer was constructed {{to study the}} spectroscopy and kinetics of free radicals. A method for producing diode laser frequency scans which are several wavelengths long, linear in frequency, and readily and accurately calibrated from reference spectra has been devised. The laser is current scanned under computer control over short overlapping segments between each of which a temperature step is made. Each segment is then linearized and pieced together to provide a final spectral scan. High-resolution spectra of transient species were collected using either magnetic rotation spectroscopy or flash kinetic spectroscopy. The high-resolution infrared spectrum of the CH stretching fundamental of the <b>formyl</b> <b>radical</b> (HCO) was observed by means of infrared kinetic spectroscopy using 308 nm (XeCl) excimer laser flash photolysis of formaldehyde or acetaldehyde followed by diode or difference-frequency laser probing of the transient absorption. The spectra obtained were assigned and fitted with rotational, spin-rotational, and centrifugal distortion constants resulting in a v 1 band origin of 2434. 48 cm- 1. New ground state constant are reported from a least-squares fit combining the v 1 infrared data with previous microwave and far-infrared laser magnetic resonance (FIR LMR) measurements. Fixed-frequency studies of infrared absorptions using the spectrometer allow the time-resolved investigation of chemical dynamics on submicrosecond time scales. A method of locking the diode laser output frequency to an external vacuum-spaced etalon by modulating the optical pathlength of the etalon was investigated. Using this technique, the rate constant of the reaction of HCO with O 2 was measured...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMany complex organic {{molecules}} (hereafter COMs) {{have been detected}} in {{different regions of the}} interstellar medium (ISM). In each region, different energetic processes – UV irradiation, atom bombardments, etc. – that could be linked to the formation of detected COMs may occur depending on the environment. Several formation mechanisms were proposed but increasing attention is paid to radical recombination reactions. Previous studies showed that glycolaldehyde (HC(O) CH 2 OH) and ethylene glycol (HOCH 2 CH 2 OH) are formed by radical recombination between HC˙O and ˙CH 2 OH, and by ˙CH 2 OH dimerisation, respectively. Formyl (HC˙O), {{one of the most famous}} astrophysically-relevant radical species, has been detected as a gaseous component of the ISM. Its reactivity was already attributed to the formation of several COMs. This work aims to study the dimerisation of <b>formyl</b> <b>radical</b> HC˙O using a cryogenic matrix technique. The evolution of the chemical sample composition is monitored by infrared spectroscopy and by mass spectrometry during temperature programmed desorption (TPD) monitoring. Results indicate that the reaction of one HC˙O with another does not lead to the direct formation of glyoxal (HC(O) C(O) H) but yields H 2 CO and CO. Results are also compared with those for the reaction between two ˙CH 2 OH radicals and the recombination between HC˙O and ˙CH 2 OH. Also, glyceraldehyde was tentatively detected in our experiment using different spectroscopic techniques. A radical mechanism is proposed to explain its formation in our experiments. Complementary quantum chemical calculations provide an atomistic interpretation of the experimental findings...|$|R
40|$|The fungus Dothistroma pini Hulbary is {{a needle}} {{pathogen}} of Pinus radiata and other pines, producing a necrotic disease {{commonly known as}} Dothistroma needle blight. The fungus is widely distributed in major pine forests throughout the world; it was reported in New Zealand on P. radiata in 1964. The species P. radiata, ponderosa, and P. nigra (laricio) are all grown extensively in New Zealand and unfortunately are all highly susceptible to the disease. Because forestry {{plays an important role}} in the New Zealand economy, the disease is of economic significance to New Zealand. The disease can be controlled by spraying with insoluble compounds of copper. Following a suggestion that D. pini might produce a toxin responsible for host cell death, a red pigment was isolated from D. pini cultures and shown to be toxic to Chlorella pyrenoidosa, a unicellular green alga. This thesis is concerned with a detailed investigation into the nature and characterisation of the red pigment. D. pini was cultured in the laboratory on an aqueous malt medium, and red pigment extracted from the cultures and purified by thin layer chromatography was shown by mass spectroscopy to be a mixture of two closely related compounds of molecular formula C 18 H 12 O 9 and C 18 H 12 O 8. The former compound which was present in greater amount, was named dothistromin, and the latter was named deoxydothistromin. Both dothistromin and deoxydothistromin were shown to be present in extracts of D. pini infected P. radiata needles. A detailed chemical investigation using chemical reactions (including the classical degradative technique of zinc dust distillation), derivative formation, infrared spectroscopy, electronic absorption spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and mass spectroscopy, allowed elucidation of the structure of dothistromin. Dothistromin was shown to be a tri-α-hydroxyanthraquinone onto which was fused a substituted tetrahydrodifuro ring system. A major feature of the structure of dothistromin is the substituted tetrahydrofuro,[2, 3 -b]benzofuran moiety. Fungal metabolites known to incorporate this structural feature include the toxic and potently carcinogenic aflatoxins, and the carcinogenic sterigmatocystin. A discussion on the possible carcinogenicity of dothistromin, its co-metabolites, and artefacts is included. The strong green-yellow fluorescence of solutions of the red pigment and dothistromin, when irradiated with ultraviolet light is attributable to the 1, 4 -dihydroxyanthraquinone chromophoric nucleus of dothistromin. Another important structural feature of dothistromin is the reactive hemiacetal group, allowing dothistromin to undergoe facile acid catalysed mono-alkylation and mono-acetylation. The probability that in solution dothistromin exists as a complex equilibrium mixture, was discussed. The mass spectrum of dothistromin shows a characteristic loss of the <b>formyl</b> <b>radical</b> CHO. (m/e 29), and the neutral fragment C 2 H 4 O (m/e 44). The same loss of a <b>formyl</b> <b>radical,</b> and a homologous neutral fragment was also shown by a number of dothistromin derivatives. Two fragmentation schemes were proposed to rationalise the mass-spectral fragmentation of dothistromin. During the course of the investigation, a number of crystalline, optically active derivatives of dothistromin were prepared; these included dothistromin penta-acetate and dothistromin ethyl ether tetra-acetate. The structure and absolute configuration of a crystalline heavy atom derivative of dothistromin was determined by an x-ray crystallographic diffraction study. This confirmed the structures proposed in this thesis, and also allowed the absolute configuration of the cis-fused furo rings of dothistromin to be deduced. Deoxydothistromin was assigned one of two structures, and the nature of other co-metabolites was briefly considered. The synthesis and biosynthesis of dothistromin was also discussed...|$|R
