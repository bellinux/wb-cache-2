40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} effects of {{collaboration}} networks on inventive productivity within an industrial research environment. A distinction is made between two kinds of network structures: structural holes offering information brokerage opportunities to individuals and network closures supporting co-specialization of individuals. Hypotheses regarding {{the effects of}} network positions {{on the development of}} technological <b>know-how</b> are <b>tested</b> based on longitudinal individual-level network data. The analysis provides partial support of both the structural hole and the network closure argument. However, contrary to literature emphasizing innovation via inter-organizational collaboration, the positive effects of ties between the research center and business units are highlighted. The interpretation of these results seems to call for more refined models of firm boundaries to better explain how the research activities are organized within firms. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{last two}} centuries have been {{distinguished}} by technological innovation, liberalization and globalization {{of the world}} economy. Out of this environment the multinational enterprises (MNEs) have arisen -seeking the best profit opportunities around the world without consideration to poverty and equality in the host countries. This has raised {{the interest of the}} present study where the objective is to assess the impact MNEs have on the host country in terms of transferring <b>know-how.</b> By <b>testing</b> two hypotheses, the study attempts to analyze whether MNEs entail a transfer of skills and also identifies the extent to which MNEs are a potential source of skill-upgrading. The research is realized by a qualitative minor field study in Dakar where 24 semi-structured interviews are carried out at three MNEs and three Senegalese enterprises. The interviews are jointly analyzed with a theoretical framework in order to determinate if there are {{significant differences between the two}} types of enterprises concerning the wage-setting, working conditions as well as transfer of know-how. The result shows that MNEs have more training opportunities then local enterprises, the working conditions do not differ significantly. Further there is no evidence found for MNEs paying higher wages then local enterprises judged by the general attitude of the interviewees. It is therefore assumed to be some labor mobility, implying that the training contributed by MNEs might work a source of skill-upgrade for the workforce in Dakar...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{workload}} of Verification and Validation (V&V) {{has increased}} constantly {{in the high}} technology industries. The changes in the business environment, with fast time-to-market and demands to decrease research and development costs, have increased the importance of efficient product creation process, including V&V. The significance of the V&V related <b>know-how</b> and <b>testing</b> is increasing in the high tech business environment. As a consequence, companies in the ICT sector have pressures for improving product development process and verification and validation activities. The main motive for this research arises {{from the fact that}} the research has been scarce on verification and validation from product development process perspective. This study approaches the above mentioned goal from four perspectives: current challenges and success factors, V&V maturity in different NPD phases, benchmarking automotive sector, and shifting the emphasis of NPD efforts. This dissertation is qualitative in nature and is based on interviewing experienced industrial managers, reflecting their views against scientific literature. The researcher has analysed the obtained material and made conclusions. The main implications of this doctoral dissertation can be concluded as a visible need to shift the emphasis of V&V activities to early NPD. These activities should be viewed and managed over the entire NPD process. There is a need for companies to understand the V&V maturity in different NPD phases and develop activities based on this understanding. Verification and validation activities must be seen as an integral element for successful NPD. Benchmarking other sectors may enable identifying development potential for NPD process. The automotive sector being a mature sector, has developed practices for successfully handling requirements during NPD. The role of V&V is different in different NPD phases. Set-based type V&V can provide required understanding during early product development. In addition, developing parallel technological alternatives and platforms during early NPD also support shifting the emphasis towards earlier development phases...|$|R
30|$|Changing {{language}} assessment {{practices is}} an enormous undertaking, necessitating sustainable, gradual, and long-term plans tailored to the immediate context wherein change is to take place. Yet, curricular innovations in EFL contexts {{are not likely to}} succeed without adequate alterations to assessment methods (Li 1998; Savignon 1991). One needs more than a ready-made package imported wholesale from another context. The very educational values and ideologies of the society in which the assessment reform is to be introduced should inform the change at the planning, implementation, and evaluation stage (Li 1998). Fulcher (2009) rightly reminds us that in countries with different political philosophies, tests come to take on different functions. Whereas tests are a means at the service of promoting meritocracy in most Western nations, tests project negative connotations in the Middle East (Gebril 2016). In the context of this study, EFL teachers’ uniform failure to resist grade inflation (Salehipour 2016) may be taken as a lack of respect for meritocracy. The message is that without profound changes in worldviews, training in the <b>know-how</b> of language <b>testing</b> would not take us far ahead (Inbar-Lourie 2008). Future inquiries into practitioners’ assessment literacy as well as plans aimed at fostering assessment literacy and changing assessment practices should take into account wider social, cultural, and philosophical considerations.|$|R
40|$|Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) are {{sensitive}} self-service systems that require important investments in security and testing. ATM certifications are testing processes for machines that integrate software components from different vendors and are performed before their deployment for public use. This project was originated {{from the need}} of optimization of the certification process in an ATM manufacturing company. The process identifies compatibility problems between software components through testing. It is composed by {{a huge number of}} manual user tasks that makes the process very expensive and error-prone. Moreover, {{it is not possible to}} fully automate the process as it requires human intervention for manipulating ATM peripherals. This project presented important challenges for the development team. First, this is a critical process, as all the ATM operations rely on the software under test. Second, the context of use of ATMs applications is vastly different from ordinary software. Third, ATMs’ useful lifetime is beyond 15 years and both new and old models need to be supported. Fourth, the <b>know-how</b> for efficient <b>testing</b> depends on each specialist and it is not explicitly documented. Fifth, the huge number of tests and their importance implies the need for user efficiency and accuracy. All these factors led us conclude that besides the technical challenges, the usability of the intended software solution was critical for the project success. This business context is the motivation of this Master Thesis project. Our proposal focused in the development process applied. By combining user-centered design (UCD) with agile development we ensured both the high priority of usability and the early mitigation of software development risks caused by all the technology constraints. We performed 23 development iterations and finally we were able to provide a working solution on time according to users’ expectations. The evaluation of the project was carried out through usability tests, where 4 real users participated in different tests in the real context of use. The results were positive, according to different metrics: error rate, efficiency, effectiveness, and user satisfaction. We discuss the problems found, the benefits and the lessons learned in the process. Finally, we measured the expected project benefits by comparing the effort required by the current and the new process (once the new software tool is adopted). The savings corresponded to 40 % less effort (man-hours) per certification. Future work includes additional evaluation of product usability in a real scenario (with customers) and the measuring of benefits in terms of quality improvement...|$|R
