40|$|Present {{work has}} got its aim {{of finding the}} role of {{different}} process parameters for A 713 alloy on the Mechanical properties of the sand castings. Different input process parameters taken under consideration are grain <b>fineness</b> <b>number,</b> moisture content, green strength and clay content. The different values of aforesaid parameters affecting the Tensile strength, Hardness and Impact strength of the final castings have been optimized by Taguchi optimization technique. Castings were prepared as per the Taguchi’s L 9 orthogonal array and their Mechanical properties as mentioned above were deduced out. It observed by graphs that the hardness shows decreasing and increasing trend {{with the increase in}} the grain <b>fineness</b> <b>number</b> and moisture content. It increases with the increase in the clay content and also shows the increasing and decreasing trend with the decrease in the green strength. Impact strength shows decreasing and increasing trend with the increase in the grain <b>fineness</b> <b>number</b> and moisture content. Effect of clay content and green strength is almost insignificant on impact strength of A 713 alloy. Tensile strength shows decreasing and increasing trend with the increase in the grain <b>fineness</b> <b>number</b> where on the other hand it shows a sharp decline by increasing the moisture content. Graph shows an increasing and decreasing trend with the increase in the green strength. It also shows an increasing trend with the increase in the clay content...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{moisture}} content of Yola natural sand has been studied. The moisture content was varied from 1 to 9 %. The {{effect of the}} moisture content on the green compression strength, green permeability and bulk density was investigated. Particle size distribution of the natural sand, the grain <b>fineness</b> <b>number,</b> average grain size, grain shape and the clay content of the natural sand were also studied. 5 % moisture gave the optimum green compression strength of 118. 6 KN/m 2. The dry compression strength increased with moisture content, an optimum value of 4000 KN/m 2 was obtained at 9 % moisture. The Yola natural sand had a grain <b>fineness</b> <b>number</b> of 88. 05 AFS, average grain size of 335. 78 microns and a clay content of 26 %. A sand mixture containing 5 % moisture was prepared and used to produce a test casting with aluminium scraps, the test casting was sound...|$|E
40|$|Sand {{casting process}} {{involves}} many parameters such as {{size of the}} sand grain, amount of clay, percentage of moisture, green compressive strength, permeability, number of ramming, shatter index, mold type, mold hardness, etc. to name a few. In this paper the effect of sand mold casting process parameters, especially composition of molding sand, on hardness, tensile strength and density of aluminium alloy castings are studied. While other parameters are kept constant, grain <b>fineness</b> <b>number,</b> amount of clay, amount of moisture and number of ramming are varied. Experiments are conducted based on Taguchi’s L 9 orthogonal array and cast specimens are tested to obtain their mechanical properties and density. The results obtained are evaluated to optimize process parameters at three different levels.. Optimum levels are found as Grain <b>fineness</b> <b>number</b> 55, two times ramming, 12 percent Clay and 13 percent Moisture. Based on optimum level of process parameters, confirmation test is conducted and results {{are found to be}} in confidence level...|$|E
40|$|Characteristics of air-jet {{textured}} yarns {{are determined by}} the instability, linear density, and strength, together with structural properties such as loop size, loop frequency, and degree of entanglement. Such characteristics are affected by various process parameters and supply yarn properties. The effects of these parameters on the final yarn properties have been investigated using instability, linear density, and strength tests, together with SEM photographs for visual assessment of the yarn structure. Optimizing any given yarn property almost always affects other yarn characteristics, and therefore this must be remembered when selecting suitable process parameters and supply yarns for specific end uses. For a given texturing nozzle and conditions, there is an optimum filament <b>fineness</b> and <b>number</b> of filaments that can be textured effectively...|$|R
30|$|The {{effect of}} fibre linear density on water {{absorbency}} of test fabrics {{is presented in}} Fig.  7. Water absorbency was observed to increase {{with the increase in}} polyester fibre linear density for both carded (RC 3.3  > RC 2.2  > RC 1.5  > RC 1.3  > RC 1.1) and combed yarn fabrics (RM 3.3  > RM 2.2  > RM 1.5  > RM 1.3  > RM 1.1). Increase in water absorbency with fibre linear density may be attributed to corresponding increase in fabric thickness and fabric porosity (Table  4). For the same yarn fineness, as the fibre <b>fineness</b> decreases, the <b>number</b> of fibres in yarn cross-section decreases, which may result in increased yarn bulkiness and availability of high pore volume in yarn structure. Large pores or a high total pore volume assists in higher liquid volume retention, as suggested by Varshney et al. (2010). An increase in water absorbency of fabrics with increase in fibre linear density is therefore well justified in the light of above arguments. Combination of polyester fibre of higher decitex and carded yarn is seen to result in fabrics of higher water absorbency.|$|R
40|$|AbstractBased on {{bodies of}} revolution, several flight and shape {{parameters}} are considered for investigating {{their effects on}} the sonic boom signature including overpressure and impulse. Here, the parameters include flight altitude, Mach number, cone half-angle, bluntness and <b>fineness</b> ratio. Mach <b>numbers</b> are varied from 1. 41 to 4. 63 due to publicized wind tunnel experimental data for reference. Near-field domain at the flight altitude is modeled by the conservative Euler equations, and the far-field region computations are carried out using the Thomas ray tracing method. According to the parametric analysis, {{it is found that}} sonic boom can be reduced by increasing flight altitude, decreasing cone half-angle, increasing fineness ratio or decreasing Mach number. However, with the increase of bluntness parameter, the overpressure on the ground decreases first and then rises, and the sonic boom impulse shows the similar trend as the overpressure when the Mach number is between 2. 96 and 4. 63, but for Mach number of 1. 41 to 2. 01, the impulse increases near linearly with the increasing of the bluntness parameter...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} carried out in order to verify whether Acoustic Emission (AE) techniques could give information on the grain <b>fineness</b> <b>number</b> of silica foundry sands characterised by different grain size arrangements. The sands used were obtained by mixing silica foundry sands with different grain sizes, resulting in different average grain size and <b>fineness</b> <b>number.</b> To achieve the goal, drop tests were carried out making the different sands to slip on a metallic slanted plane equipped with an AE sensor. The AE emission signals were recorded and their typical parameters were analysed. The AE response was very sensitive to the geometry of experimental set up and test procedures, being mainly affected by the sand falling height and quantity, {{as well as on the}} length of the slanted plane. Nevertheless, for a fixed experimental set up and test procedure, the AE energy was strongly correlated with the average grain size, exponentially decreasing with increasing sand fineness. Thanks to its features, this method seems to be promising as an in-process monitoring system, based on a quick evaluation of the grain size...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Casting is a age old {{production}} technique wherein cavities are formed by a pattern into a porous and refractive material, usually sand, and then liquid metal is {{poured into the}} cavity so that it takes up {{the shape of the}} cavity, thus forming the required metal product. Various properties of sand such as grain <b>fineness</b> <b>number,</b> green compressive strength, refractive ness, clay content, moisture, mould strength, etc have an appreciable effect over the produced casting [1]. An experimental study was conducted to study the effect of three parameters, namely, moisture content of sand mould, the clay content of sand mixture and grain <b>fineness</b> <b>number</b> of sand on the tensile strength of the casting produced. Experiments were planned using the strategy of design of experiments, level and range of input parameters i. e. moisture, clay content and grain size were selected and then experiments were conducted [8, 14]. In each run, the tensile strength of obtained casting was measured using the Universal Testing Machine [12]. Some considerations were put up for the hardness number, visual blow holes, surface finish, pin holes etc. Since we took into account three factors, the use of Taguchi method was made, a total of nine sand mixtures were made for the application of L 9 technique [14]. These samples were then put to test for tensile strength and analysis was conducted for the collected data to study the main effects. Optimization was done by Taguchi Technique [2]. I...|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} {{to the way the}} level of the different compositions influenced texture, the way Egyptian blue was processed also had an effect on its texture, in terms of coarseness and <b>fineness.</b> Following a <b>number</b> of experiments, Title et al. concluded that for fine-textured Egyptian blue, two stages were necessary to obtain uniformly interspersed crystals. First, the ingredients are heated, and the result is a coarse-textured product. This is then ground to a fine powder and water is added. The paste is then reshaped and fired again at temperatures ranging between 850 and 950 °C for one hour. These two stages possibly were needed to produce a paste that was fine enough for the production of small objects. Coarse-textured Egyptian blue, though, would not have gone through the second stage. Since it is usually found in the form of slabs (in the dynastic periods) and balls (in the Greco-Roman period), these could have either been awaiting to be processed through a second stage, where they would be ground and finely textured, or they would have been ground for use as a blue pigment.|$|R

The data also reflected in the increase in breast cancer cases. In Indonesia, two cases also the highest cases of adult female deaths. Based on Hospital Information System, the number of breast cancer patients either inpatient or outpatient care amounted to 28. 7 %. This fact revealed more than 40 % of all cancers can be prevented with early detection cancer. Role of Information Technology can implemented by data mining techniques to shorten the diagnosing time, accuracy and selection of factors early detection of breast cancer. Stepwise binary logistic regression method has the advantage to add and subtract the independent variables in accordance with level of significance of the model. Based on the analysis of weighting method, the highest four variables that should be more aware is the area of cancer (area), <b>fineness</b> (smoothness), the <b>number</b> of dots (concave points) or the nucleus of cancer and grayish level of cancer (texture).

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{assess how}} {{effectively}} a routine adjustment {{can be made}} for socio-economic confounding in small area studies of environment and health using indirect standardisation and small area deprivation indices, including analysis of the appropriate size of population unit on which to base the deprivation index and the importance of region and urban/rural status as axes of stratification. METHODS [...] Standardised morbidity ratios were calculated for cancers in Great Britain for 1981 and standardised mortality ratios for all cause mortality in Great Britain between 1982 and 1985. Deprivation indices were calculated for enumeration districts and wards from 1981 small area census statistics. Cancers and deaths were allocated to enumeration districts via their postcode. Standardised morbidity and mortality ratios were calculated by quintile of enumeration district according to the deprivation index. Standardised mortality ratios were further analysed by deprivation of ward, region, and urban/rural status. RESULTS [...] Strong relationships were found between all cause mortality and the incidence of selected cancers and deprivation quintile-there was up to a twofold difference in lung cancer incidence between the highest and lowest quintile. The deprivation index can be used to measure gradients of deprivation according to the distance from industrial sites. The deprivation index for enumeration districts showed similar discrimination of mortality as the index forwards. There is some interaction between deprivation and region in their effect on the standardised mortality ratios, leading to a small bias in the estimation of expected numbers if this is not taken into account. The relationship between deprivation, urban/rural status, and mortality is complex and confounded by region, but mortality tends to be higher in urban than in rural areas within quintiles of deprivation. DISCUSSION [...] Whether calculated for enumeration districts or wards, the main problems in the interpretation of the deprivation index may be its limited correlation with the risk factors of interest and its concentration on present rather than past socioeconomic status. Indirect standardisation based on stratification for deprivation and other variable involves a trade off between bias and precision in determining the <b>fineness</b> and the <b>number</b> of axes of stratification. Some bias may occur due to interaction between region and deprivation and the effects of urban/rural status. Complementary approaches including modeling and proportional mortality or morbidity analyses may be needed and the possibility of residual socioeconomic confounding must always be considered. CONCLUSION [...] There is potential for important socioeconomic confounding in small area studies of environmental pollution and health where the health outcome under examination has a strong relationship to socioeconomic status and where the putative excess risk due to pollution may be small. One method of controlling for confounding is to use an ecological measurement of deprivation in small areas, and to adjust for deprivation by indirect standardisation. However, residual socioeconomic confounding can be expected, which may seriously complicate the interpretation of small area studies...|$|R

Experiments were conducted as per Taguchi’s L 9 orthogonal array. Castings were made under the constraint of different process parameters like mould firing temperature, pouring temperature, firing time and mixing of silica sand of different grain fineness numbers to investigate their effects on the surface hardness, impact strength and tensile strength of the final castings. The variations in the trend of the aforesaid mechanical properties were observed and it was deduced out that high mould firing temperature, higher pouring temperature, maximum firing time and high grain <b>fineness</b> <b>number</b> significantly reduce the mechanical properties of A 713 alloy castings produced by the above process...|$|E

Therefore, such a tool can replace the experiments if simulation results are recognized to be reliable and reflecting the reality. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code AIR was employed for the description of the transient behaviour of confined fires. The code solves the balance equations for the conservation of mass, momentum, energy and gas species within the physical domain of interest and yields local predictions of temperature, velocity, smoke, species concentration, etc, as a function of time. Firstly a sensitivity analysis of the computer code with respect to its parameters was performed, then experimental data from literature were employed to test the computer code performances. Simulations were obtained for a small scale steady-state tunnel fire and for an unsteady-state tunnel fire. AIR's performances in simulating tunnel fires were fair. Results depend on code parameters (grid <b>fineness,</b> <b>number</b> of iterations and step time interval) and on initial and boundary conditions such as temperatures, ventilation, heat release rate and radiant and convective heat transfer at the walls.

While {{it is well}} known that the properties and quality of a mold depend on its material composition and molding process, this has not been investigated well for chemically bonded molds. In this work, the effect of sand grain size, binder percentage and curing time (each varied in three levels) on the mechanical properties (compression strength, shear strength and core hardness) as well as dimensional changes (shrinkage) of no-bake chemically-bonded molds and cores was studied through lab experiments. Their mechanical properties were found to increase with an increase in binder content and curing time; and decrease with increasing grain <b>fineness</b> <b>number.</b> The shrinkage was found to increase with an increase in all three process parameters. The results are explained in terms of bonding and curing phenomena of binders, and evaporation of solvent. These are also supported by SEM analysis of crosslinked resin bridges between sand grains. The findings were incorporated into a multi-objective optimization model to obtain the desired combination of mold properties, which is solved as a linear programming problem.

However, {{there seems to be}} no single graded source of moulding sand that the practitioners can use for producing qualitative sand castings. Therefore, this study was carried out to characterise moulding sands from five selected deposits in Maiduguri for possible use in sand casting applications. Chemical compositions of sand samples were determined using XRF Analyser while American Foundrymen’s Society (AFS) standard laboratory tests were used to determine the physico-mechanical properties. The results of the characterisation revealed the following ranges of values; clay content from 21. 8 % to 47. 2 % corresponding to Pompomari and Gwange/Fori, grain <b>fineness</b> <b>number</b> from 50. 94 AFS to 95. 02 AFS corresponding to Pompomari and Gwange/Fori deposits [...] Other physico-mechanical properties determined included; green and dry compressive strengths, permeability, loss on ignition and refractoriness. Results of chemical composition analysis show SiO 2 having dominance in all the samples (90. 10 % to 66. 77 %) with trace elements of CaO, Fe 2 O 3, Al 2 O 3, MgO, TiO 2, K 2 O, NaO 2 also present within acceptable limits. The overall results show that all deposits have potential for use in sand casting applications for the casting of nonferrous metals and malleable and ductile iron. However, the clay content range given above is a major problem compared with the standards recommended by the American Foundry Society. This did not only limit their uses to low melting point alloys because of relatively lower refractoriness values but also possesses danger to their life expectancy. In conclusion, the use of the deposits characterised especially the Gwange/Fori deposit with clay content of 47. 2 % should be used with caution because of the possibility of developing gas defects like blowholes and pinholes. All the other four deposits have been recommended for full exploitation for use in sand casting applications for casting of nonferrous metals as well as malleable and ductile irons.

40|$|International audienceQuestions {{about the}} links between {{investments}} in transport infrastructure and regional development is a longstanding topic for spatial planners, specifically economists. According to several transport and urbanism specialists, economic effects induced by transport infrastructures are not defined by a deterministic relationship. Moreover, the complexity of transport impacts on development leads Plassard, amongst others, to consider the significance of territorial (not only economic) effects. In this context, instead of producing economic predictions, this work proposes a measure of territorial effects of a new transport infrastructure in a forecasting approach. So, {{the aim of this}} research is to build a tool for decision support in planning and transport policy that can show the potential of transport networks to provide the structure of a regional or metropolitan area. This doesn’t mean to replace an economic analysis, but rather to provide further and complementary information to the decision-makers. For instance, french LGV (high-speed train lines) are obviously major tools for development at regional scale. In PACA (Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur) region, the project {{can be seen as a}} future backbone to economic and social relations between Aix-Marseille metropolitan area and Côte d’Azur conurbation (around Nice). Nonetheless, within these two City-regions, LGV can be used as another transport service, thereby support local (urban) relations. To assess this double role of LGV, transport service, understood as the set of speed, schedule and <b>fineness</b> (<b>number</b> of train stops) has to be modelled. Modelling approach is based on a transport-oriented GIS using scheduled graph to represent transport service as previously defined. The model uses scheduled accessibility and path capillarity to define territorial effects of a given transport service. Scheduled accessibility gives disaggregated spatiotemporal distance between two places whereas path capillarity represents the fineness of transport service, i. e. potential for small scale use of the transport service. The confrontation of these two indicators can give an idea of the tension between speed and territorial potential. Indeed, a fine metropolitan service will necessarily damage trip speed at regional scale. At the opposite, a looser transport service (removal of a train stop), involves a speed gain...|$|E
