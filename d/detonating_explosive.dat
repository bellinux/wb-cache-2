50|$|Bulldozers {{employed}} for combat engineering roles are often fitted with armor {{to protect the}} driver from firearms and debris, enabling bulldozers to operate in combat zones. The most widely documented use is the Israeli Defence Forces' (IDF) militarized Caterpillar D9, for earth moving, clearing terrain obstacles, opening routes, <b>detonating</b> <b>explosive</b> charges. The extensive use of armored bulldozers during the Second Intifada drew controversy and criticism from human rights organizations while military experts {{saw it as a}} key factor in reducing IDF casualties.|$|E
50|$|Shaped charges can {{be defended}} against {{by the use}} of {{explosive}} reactive armour (ERA), or complex composite armour arrays. ERA uses a high explosive sandwiched between two, relatively thin, (normally) metallic plates. The explosive is detonated when struck by the shaped charge’s jet, the <b>detonating</b> <b>explosive</b> sandwich forces the two plates apart, lowering the jets’ penetration by interfering with, and disrupting it. A disadvantage of using ERA is that each plate can protect against a single strike, and the resulting explosion can be extremely dangerous to nearby personnel and lightly armoured structures.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{describes}} an {{experimental study of}} dam-water-foundation interaction that was con-ducted on Dongjiang Arch Dam in China. In the primary tests, the dam and its retained lake were excited by <b>detonating</b> <b>explosive</b> charges buried in the foundation rock. The system responses to the explosions were recorded by accelerometers, pressure transducers {{as well as by}} three-component seismographs. In the secondary test series, the system was excited by shock waves propagated in the lake from small suspended charges. In addition, two approaches based on the seismic refraction and reflection techniques were used to determine the reflection coefficient of the lake-bottom materials. The results obtained indicate that contain-ed explosive detonations appear to be the best means for exciting the dam-water-foundation system in order to predict the dynamic response of the combined system for validation of existing analytical procedures...|$|E
40|$|A {{cylindrical}} <b>detonating</b> <b>explosive</b> behaves like a non-Newtonian {{viscous fluid}} {{emerging from a}} cylindrical pipe. The expression for non-Newtonian viscous flow {{has been applied to}} detonating explosives. The resultant fit to emerging flame fronts from detonation is excellent {{for a wide variety of}} detonating explosives both for transients (at various times) and for steady state. The quantities k′(λ/λ 1) (2 /B) and 1 /B and the rate constant k′ increase abruptly at a time supporting a change in mechanism from deflagration to detonation in the transient during initiation. All of these parameters are temperature sensitive, indicating an abrupt temperature increase as a condition or indicator in the deflagration-to-detonation transition. Furthermore, a straight line results when log particle velocity u is plotted against log radial distance r, indicating that, for the explosives studied, the hyperbolic cosine wave front can be replaced by a parabolic wave front within the accuracy of the available experimental data...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{development}} of software for the measurement of <b>detonating</b> <b>explosive</b> temperature using two color ratio pyrometry. Planck’s law for black body radiation has been used for predicting the spectral radiance at different absolute temperatures and wavelength. Vandermonde’s algorithm is used for interpolating the emissivity values at different wavelengths. This value is further refined using least square’s approximation method. The main objective of our studies is to plot graphs for some input values of the parameters such as emissivity, spectral radiance, absolute temperature and wavelength and to establish the relation and behaviour of these parameters when value of one of them is changed. The unknown values of emissivity and radiance at known values of wavelength and temperature have been calculated by using these graphs. The software has been developed for these studies in C, C++ language and tested for two wavelengths (0. 450 μm and 0. 650 μm) to measure the temperature for polished tungsten...|$|E

40|$|Blasting is {{the primary}} {{comminution}} process in most mining operations. This process involves the highly complex and dynamic interaction between two main components. The first is the <b>detonating</b> <b>explosive</b> {{and the second is}} the rock mass into which the explosive is loaded. The mechanical properties of the rock material (such as dynamic strength, tensile strength, dynamic modulus and fracture toughness) are important considerations in understanding the blasting process. However, it is the characteristics of the geological defects (joints, foliation planes, bedding planes) within the rock mass that ultimately determine how effectively a blast performs in terms of fragmentation, all else being equal. The defect characteristics include, but are not limited to, their orientation, spacing, and mechanical properties. During the blasting process, some of the geotechnical characteristics of the rock mass are substantially changed. From the blasting outcome point of view, the most notable and important is the change in fragment size distribution that the rock mass undergoes. The pre-blast in situ defect-bounded block size distribution is transformed into the post-blast muckpile fragment size distribution. Consequently, it is fundamental to our understanding of and ability to predict the blasting process that both the blastability of a rock mass and its transformation into the fragment size distribution can be appropriately quantified...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} the successful {{experience of the}} directional control blasting of two 90 m-high reinforced concrete cooling towers of Hefei Power Plant in Anhui Province. The blasting is in the complex environment. It emphatically {{describes the}} pretreatment measures, blasting cut shape and size, blasting parameters, detonator detonating network and blasting safety technology of the directional window, oriented window and load reducing slot, and the blasting vibration was tested and analyzed, and this paper provides the protection method for opening the special-shape load reducing slot and dense mesh safety net cross-multilayer coverage. Especially, the blast holes for opening the special-shape load reducing slot and the herringbone column are centralized {{at the bottom and}} top, which not only reduces the drilling workload, but also reduces the maximum <b>detonating</b> <b>explosive</b> amount of single section, and also reduces the safety protection workload.

40|$|The {{front end}} beamline section {{contains}} photon shutters and fixed masks. These components {{are made of}} OFHC copper and GlidCOP AL- 15. Stainless steels (304 or 316) are also used for connecting photon shutters and fixed masks to other components that operate in the ultrahigh vacuum system. All these dissimilar materials need to be joined together. However, bonding these dissimilar materials is very difficult because of their different mechanical and thermal properties and incompatible metallurgical properties. Explosion bonding is a bonding method in which the controlled energy of a <b>detonating</b> <b>explosive</b> is {{used to create a}} metallurgical bond between two or more similar or dissimilar materials. No intermediate filler metal, for example, a brazing compound or soldering alloy, is needed to promote bonding, and no external heat need be applied. A study of the metallurgical and mechanical properties and YGV applications of GlidCop AL- 15, OFHC copper, and 304 stainless steel explosion-bonded joints has been done. This report contains five parts: an ultrasonic examination of explosion-bonded joints and a standard setup; mechanical-property and thermal-cycle tests of GlidCop AL- 15 / 304 stainless steel explosion-bonded joints; leak tests of a GlidCop AL- 15 / 304 stainless steel explosion-bonded interfaces for UHV application; metallurgical examination of explosion-bonded interfaces and failure analysis, and discussion and conclusion...|$|E
