PCS is the sublayer {{of the physical}} layer of PCI Express 1. 0. The major constituents of this layer are transmitter and receiver. Transmitter comprises of 8 b/ 10 b encoder. The Primary purpose of this scheme is to embed a clock into the serial bit stream of transmitter lanes. No clock is transmitted along with the serial data bit stream.

We develop a channel occupancy detector to apply universal globally adaptive load-balancing (UGAL) rout-ing to load balance traffic in networks using EBs. Using EBs results in up to 12 % (17 % for low-swing channels) improvement in peak throughput per unit power compared to a network using VC flow control. The power saved by eliminating VCBs is used to make channels wider, providing increased throughput that more than offsets the degradation caused by increased blocking without VCs.

By implementing iterative and/or recursive modelling features in the supporting toolset (WickedXmas), a network can be constructed that remains generic {{in the number of}} nodes. Using a formally specified syntax for the equations in source, switch, function et cetera, the necessary packet routing decisions can be defined unambiguously. There remains a small amount of ambiguity in the expression language that should be addressed. Assumptions about the tacit resolution of identical data fields for multi-input primitives should be formalized in order to avoid different interpretations across toolchains. In conjuction with the generation of a flattened netlist and an automated translation to a simulation-capable language such as Verilog, the network can be verified. The generalisation of xMAS primitives to their n-input or -output equivalents is straightforward, with only minor remarks for the arbitration of n-input merges. A particular area where xMAS is lacking expressivity is pipelining. Using the k >= 2 -deep queue primitives, data processing stages can be formed that are locally decoupled from each other using <b>elastic</b> <b>buffers</b> (FIFOs). When extending the notion of a queue to k = 1, however, pipelining becomes severely limited in bandwidth and cannot be used to model the typical register stages used in manually crafted digital logic.

The xMAS primitives are not semantically complete and are lacking some expressivity that would be available when modelling directly in an underlying hardware description language. Shortcomings in expressivity that presented themselves during the design of the Write- Once example algorithm were addressed by the introduction of new primitives (ctrljoin, forkany, joitch, peek). Although not all of these will adhere to the persistence assumption, their existence is indicative that a more rigorous exploration of possible Boolean equations for control and data flow will give rise to additional useful primitives...|$|R

EB routers {{have been shown to be}} more efficient than virtual channel routers, as they do not require input buffers or complex logic for managing virtual channels and tracking credits. Wormhole routers are more comparable in terms of complexity because they also lack virtual channels. This paper compares EB and wormhole routers and explores novel hybrid designs to more closely examine the effect of design simplicity and input buffer cost. Our results show that EB routers have up to 25 percent smaller cycle time compared to wormhole and hybrid routers. Moreover, EB flow control requires 10 percent less energy to transfer a single bit through a router and offers three percent more throughput per unit energy as well as 62 percent more throughput per unit area.

40|$|Prolonged {{exposure}} to vehicular vibration and shocks has {{been related to}} discomfort, reduced work efficiency and various health and safety risks for the drivers, specifically for the off-road vehicle drivers. Enhancement of shock and vibration environment of such vehicles involves characterization of vibration environment, biodynamic response of the driver, design and analysis of secondary suspension, and seating dynamics. Relationships between biodynamic measures are derived through analysis of measured data and selected biodynamic models. The magnitude of variations in subject characteristics and test conditions can be significantly reduced by representing 'to-the-body' biodynamic characteristics in terms of apparent mass (APMS) and by identifying a range of test conditions applicable to off-road vehicle driving. It is further shown that normalized APMS correlates well with the 'through the body' biodynamic function, {{expressed in terms of}} seat-to-head transmissibility (STHT). A synthesis of reported data is performed to propose a range of idealized biodynamic response characteristics. A three degree-of-freedom biodynamic model of the occupant is developed using measured response characteristics. Occupant-seat interactions are investigated through measurement and analysis of contact force and area. The results are utilized to propose a nonlinear and asymmetric seat cushion model. A nonlinear suspension seat model is further developed to incorporate asymmetric force-velocity and nonlinear force-deflection characteristics of the damper and elastic end-stops, respectively. A combined human-suspension seat model is finally derived upon integrating the proposed occupant, cushion and suspension models. The results show that the model is an effective tool for assessment of seating dynamic comfort and whole-body vibration exposure. The results of a comprehensive parametric study clearly revealed that attenuation of continuous and shock-type excitations pose conflicting design requirements. It is thus proposed to develop suspension design for optimal attenuation of continuous vibration, while the severity of end-stop impacts caused by shock-type excitations be minimized through design of optimal buffers. The suspension performance under continuous and shock excitations is assessed in terms of Seat Effective Amplitude Transmissibility (SEAT) and Vibration Dose Value (VDV) ratio, respectively. Two different optimization problems are formulated to minimize the SEAT and VDV ratios. The results suggest that soft and lightly damped suspension with low degree of damping asymmetry coupled with low friction and large mass can enhance vibration isolation performance.

Most dynamic schemes use a table of state counters associated with specific branches, coupled with a buffer recording recent branch outcomes to correlate the behaviour of individual branches {{with the history of}} other recently executed branch instructions. The combination generally yields a higher prediction rate than branch-specific counters alone. There is always a question of how much correlation to use and recent studies have reported that some programs benefit from higher levels of correlation than others. In our preliminary studies, we have made the following observation about the nature of branch behaviour: although it is true that most of the branches are correlated with previously executed branches, the actual number of branch outcomes they depend on varies strongly from one branch to another. This thesis presents the <b>Elastic</b> History <b>Buffer,</b> an effective scheme that can exploit the property that each branch instruction may have a different degree of correlation with other branches, while keeping the simple structure of a single global branch history.

40|$|In {{an effort}} to achieve the high {{prediction}} accuracy needed to attain high instruction throughputs, branch predictors proposed in the literature and used in real systems have become increasingly more complex and larger over time. This is {{not consistent with the}} anticipated trend of simpler and more numerous cores in future multi-core processors. We introduce the Spotlight Branch predictor, a novel profile-based predictor which is able to achieve high prediction accuracy despite its simple design. Spotlight achieves high accuracy because complex decisions in the prediction process are made during an OS managed, one-time profile run instead of using complex hardware. We show that Spotlight achieves higher accuracy than Gshare as well as highly accurate and implementable predictors such as YAGS and the Hybrid Bimodal-Gshare predictor. It achieves an average reduction in misprediction rate of 20 % over Gshare, 11 % over <b>Elastic</b> History <b>Buffer,</b> 14 % over Yags and 10 % over Hybrid for a hardware budget of 8 kB. Spotlight is also compared to two difficult to implement neural predictors, the Path-based Neural and the Hashed Perceptron. It outperforms the Path-based Neural predictor at all sizes and the Hashed Perceptron at smaller hardware budgets. These results demonstrate that a simple profile-based predictor can achieve many of the benefits of more complex predictors. We also show that a single cycle latency implementation of Spotlight can be achieved without sacrificing accuracy by using an upstream replacement scheme. 1...|$|R
