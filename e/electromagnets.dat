5|$|In later years, {{numerous}} {{proposals were}} put forward to salvage Titanic. However, all fell afoul of practical and technological difficulties, {{a lack of}} funding and, in many cases, {{a lack of understanding}} of the physical conditions at the wreck site. Charles Smith, an architect from Denver, proposed in March 1914 to attach <b>electromagnets</b> to a submarine which would be irresistibly drawn to the wreck's steel hull. Having found its exact position, more <b>electromagnets</b> would be sent down from a fleet of barges which would winch Titanic to the surface. An estimated cost of $1.5 million (£ today) and its impracticality meant that the idea was not put into practice. Another proposal involved raising Titanic by means of attaching balloons to her hull using <b>electromagnets.</b> Once enough balloons had been attached, the ship would float gently to the surface. Again, the idea got no further than the drawing board.|$|E
5|$|Integrated {{circuits}} {{and printed}} circuit boards increasingly feature copper in place of aluminium because of its superior electrical conductivity; heat sinks and heat exchangers use copper because of its superior heat dissipation properties. <b>Electromagnets,</b> vacuum tubes, cathode ray tubes, and magnetrons in microwave ovens use copper, as do waveguides for microwave radiation.|$|E

Electric stop actions can be controlled at the console by stop knobs, by pivoted tilting tablets, or rocker tabs. These are simple switches, like wall switches for room lights. Some may include <b>electromagnets</b> for setting or resetting when combinations are selected.|$|E

With the teeth aligned to <b>electromagnet</b> 1, they will be slightly offset from right <b>electromagnet</b> (2).Frame 2: The top <b>electromagnet</b> (1) is turned off, and the right <b>electromagnet</b> (2) is energized, pulling the teeth into alignment with it. This results in a rotation of 3.6° in this example.Frame 3: The bottom <b>electromagnet</b> (3) is energized; another 3.6° rotation occurs.Frame 4: The left <b>electromagnet</b> (4) is energized, rotating again by 3.6°. When the top <b>electromagnet</b> (1) is again enabled, the rotor will have rotated by one tooth position; since there are 25 teeth, it will take 100 steps to make a full rotation in this example.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} solve the problem of hybrid <b>electromagnet</b> lock orbit, we design a new type of AlNiCo-NdFeB hybrid {{levitation}} <b>electromagnet.</b> The theoretical analysis has be carried on and mathematical model is established for AlNiCo-NdFeB hybrid levitation <b>electromagnet.</b> Through two dimensional simulation, the electromagnetic characteristics of the suspended <b>electromagnet</b> are analyzed in the 3 typical operating conditions, which are in heavy load at gap 8 mm, in full load at gap 16 mm and in no-load at gap 3 mm.

25|$|There are two independent, {{fast-acting}} safety {{shutdown systems}} as well. Shutoff rods are held above the reactor by <b>electromagnets,</b> and drop under gravity {{into the core}} to quickly end criticality. This system works even {{in the event of}} a complete power failure, as the <b>electromagnets</b> only hold the rods out of the reactor when power is available.

25|$|<b>Electromagnets</b> in {{electric}} motors, generators, and transformers {{do not use}} solid metal, {{but instead}} use thin sheets of metal plate, called laminations. These thin plates reduce the parasitic eddy currents, as described below.|$|E
50|$|When current {{passes through}} the <b>electromagnet,</b> a {{magnetic}} field is produced, which attracts the moving core of the contactor. The <b>electromagnet</b> coil draws more current initially, until its inductance increases when the metal core enters the coil. The moving contact is propelled by the moving core; the force developed by the <b>electromagnet</b> holds the moving and fixed contacts together. When the contactor coil is de-energized, gravity or a spring returns the <b>electromagnet</b> core to its initial position and opens the contacts.|$|R

25|$|Before about 1905 when tube type {{rectifiers}} were developed, {{power conversion}} devices were purely electro-mechanical in design.

25|$|Electrodynamic {{suspension}} (EDS) uses superconducting <b>electromagnets</b> or strong {{permanent magnets}} {{that create a}} magnetic field, which induces currents in nearby metallic conductors when there is relative movement, which pushes and pulls the train towards the designed levitation position on the guide way.|$|E

2500|$|An {{electromagnetic}} lock is {{a simple}} locking device that consists of an <b>electromagnet</b> and armature plate. By attaching the <b>electromagnet</b> to the door frame and the armature plate to the door, a current passing through the <b>electromagnet</b> attracts the armature plate holding the door shut.

25|$|Electromagnets: Some {{machines}} feature {{electrically operated}} magnets below the playfield {{to affect the}} ball's speed and/or trajectory according to {{the current state of}} game play. This may be done to make the ball's movement unpredictable, to temporarily halt the ball (as a ball saver, for example), or to otherwise control the ball by non-mechanical means. <b>Electromagnets</b> may also be used in above-playfield elements (often as part of the playfield toys) to grab the ball and move it elsewhere (onto a mini-playfield, for example). The Williams machine The Twilight Zone featured a mini-playfield that used <b>electromagnets</b> controlled by the flipper buttons, allowing the player to flip the ball on the mini-playfield, essentially working as invisible flippers. Contrary to somewhat popular myth, there are no professionally produced pinball machines known to contain magnets under the playfield intended to clandestinely make game play harder or increase ball losses.|$|E

5000|$|An {{electromagnetic}} lock, magnetic lock, or maglock is a {{locking device}} {{that consists of}} an <b>electromagnet</b> and an armature plate. There are two main types of electric locking devices. Locking devices can be either [...] "fail safe" [...] or [...] "fail secure". A fail-secure locking device remains locked when power is lost. Fail-safe locking devices are unlocked when de-energized. Direct pull electromagnetic locks are inherently fail-safe. Typically the <b>electromagnet</b> portion of the lock {{is attached to the}} door frame and a mating armature plate is attached to the door. The two components are in contact when the door is closed. When the <b>electromagnet</b> is energized, a current passing through the <b>electromagnet</b> creates a magnetic flux that causes the armature plate to attract to the <b>electromagnet,</b> creating a locking action. Because the mating area of the <b>electromagnet</b> and armature is relatively large, the force created by the magnetic flux is strong enough to keep the door locked even under stress.|$|R

25|$|William Fothergill Cooke and Charles Wheatstone {{developed}} a telegraph around 1838-40. In 1840 Wheatstone {{was using a}} magneto that he developed to power the telegraph. Wheatstone and Cooke made an important improvement in electrical generation by using a battery-powered electromagnet {{in place of a}} permanent magnet, which they patented in 1845. The self-excited magnetic field dynamo did away with the battery to power <b>electromagnets.</b> This type of dynamo was made by several people in 1866.|$|E
25|$|Carbon {{arc lamps}} were started by making contact between two carbon electrodes, {{which were then}} {{separated}} to within a narrow gap. Because the carbon burned away, the gap had to be constantly readjusted. Several mechanisms were developed to regulate the arc. A common approach was to feed a carbon electrode by gravity and maintain the gap {{with a pair of}} <b>electromagnets,</b> one of which retracted the upper carbon after the arc was started and the second controlled a brake on the gravity feed.|$|E

40|$|Novel {{concepts}} for {{the magnetic}} circuit in magnetorheological dampers have been proven. In {{contrast to the}} established magnetic circuits where the magnetic field for {{the control of the}} magnetorheological fluid is generated by the coil of an <b>electromagnet,</b> hybrid magnetic circuits consisting of at least one permanent or hard magnet and an <b>electromagnet</b> are used in the new approaches. Three different technical configurations are distinguished: (1) The <b>electromagnet</b> is combined with two permanent magnets, whose magnetization cannot be modified even by strong magnetic fields of the <b>electromagnet.</b> The main advantage is the improved fail-safe behavior of the damper in case of a power failure. (2) The <b>electromagnet</b> is combined with a hard magnet, whose magnetization can be modified by the <b>electromagnet.</b> This configuration leads to high energy efficiency, because electric power is only required in short pulses for the switching of the hard magnet. (3) All three types of magnetic field sources, permanent, hard, and <b>electromagnet,</b> are combined in the magnetic circuit, which gives the highest flexibility of the magnetic field generation and the damping control at the expense of a relatively large effort. Demonstrators for magnetorheological dampers with all three magnetic circuits were constructed and their performances were tested. The results of the investigations are described in this paper...|$|R
