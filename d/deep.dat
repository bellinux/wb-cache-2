5|$|A <b>deep</b> {{stop was}} {{originally}} an extra stop introduced by divers during ascent, at a greater depth than the deepest stop required by their computer algorithm or tables. This practice {{is based on}} empirical observations by technical divers such as Richard Pyle, who found that they were less fatigued if they made some additional stops for short periods at depths considerably deeper than those calculated with the currently published decompression algorithms. More recently computer algorithms that are claimed to use <b>deep</b> stops have become available, but these algorithms {{and the practice of}} <b>deep</b> stops have not been adequately validated. <b>Deep</b> stops are likely to be made at depths where ingassing continues for some slow tissues, so the addition of <b>deep</b> stops of any kind can only be included in the dive profile when the decompression schedule has been computed to include them, so that such ingassing of slower tissues can be taken into account. Nevertheless, <b>deep</b> stops may be added on a dive that relies on a personal dive computer with real-time computation, as the PDC will track the effect of the stop on its decompression schedule. <b>Deep</b> stops are otherwise similar to any other staged decompression, but are unlikely to use a dedicated decompression gas, as they are usually not more than two to three minutes long.|$|E

5|$|<b>Deep</b> frying (also {{referred}} to as <b>deep</b> fat frying) is a cooking method in which food is submerged in hot fat, most commonly oil, rather than the shallow oil used in conventional frying, done in a frying pan. Normally, a <b>deep</b> fryer or chip pan is used for this; industrially, a pressure fryer or vacuum fryer may be used. <b>Deep</b> frying may also be performed using oil that is heated in a pot. <b>Deep</b> frying is classified as hot-fat cooking method. Typically, <b>deep</b> frying foods cook quickly: all sides of a food are cooked simultaneously as oil has {{a high rate of}} heat conduction.|$|E
5|$|<b>Deep</b> frying is {{done with}} a <b>deep</b> fryer, a pan such as a wok or chip pan, a Dutch oven, or a {{cast-iron}} pot. Additional tools include fry baskets, which are used to contain foods in a <b>deep</b> fryer and to strain foods when removed from the oil, and cooking thermometers, used to gauge oil temperature. Tongs, slotted spoons, wooden spoons, and sieves {{may be used to}} remove or separate foods from the hot oil.|$|E
5|$|<b>Deep</b> frying {{is popular}} worldwide, with deep-fried foods {{accounting}} {{for a large}} portion of global caloric consumption. Many foods are deep-fried and cultures surrounding <b>deep</b> frying have developed, most notably in the Southern United States, where many events dedicated to <b>deep</b> frying food and non-edible items are held.|$|E

50|$|Fins are {{constructed}} of plastic, fiberglass or aluminum. Shorter fins must be <b>deeper</b> {{to get the}} same amount of tracking. A shallower fin does not track as well as a <b>deeper</b> one. But a <b>deeper</b> fin has more drag in the water, and does not release from the water as fast.|$|R
5|$|<b>Deep</b> frying {{produces}} {{large amounts}} of waste oil, which must be disposed of properly. Waste oil can overflow sewage systems, bind to the walls of sewage pipes, and interfere with sewage treatment. Waste oil from <b>deep</b> frying is increasingly being recycled and refined into biodiesel. Potatoes that are stored in artificially humidified warehouses contain more water, which makes {{the time required to}} <b>deep</b> fry them into chips longer. This increases the carbon dioxide footprint of commercially producing chips because more energy is required for frying over a longer time. According to one source, an average home appliance <b>deep</b> fryer draws 2,000 watts.|$|E
5|$|<b>Deep</b> frying {{requires}} a <b>deep</b> fryer or other device {{in which the}} chicken pieces can be completely submerged in hot fat. The process of <b>deep</b> frying is basically placing food fully in oil and then cooking it {{at a very high}} temperature. The pieces are prepared as described above. The fat is heated in the <b>deep</b> fryer to the desired temperature. The pieces are added to the fat and a constant temperature is maintained throughout the cooking process.|$|E
5|$|<b>Deep</b> vein {{thrombosis}}, or <b>deep</b> {{venous thrombosis}} (DVT), is {{the formation of}} a blood clot (thrombus) within a <b>deep</b> vein, most commonly the legs. Nonspecific signs may include pain, swelling, redness, warmness, and engorged superficial veins. Pulmonary embolism, a potentially life-threatening complication, is caused by the detachment (embolization) of a clot that travels to the lungs. Together, DVT and pulmonary embolism constitute a single disease process known as venous thromboembolism. Post-thrombotic syndrome, another complication, significantly contributes to the health-care cost of DVT.|$|E
