Usually the position of the head is assumed to be fixed during the experiment, but if the head has moved or data from different measurement sessions are combined, the combination of different head positions blurs the data spatially and adds a location bias. Therefore, the movements should be either eliminated or taken into account in the analysis. Subjects are typically asked to keep their head still during the measurements.

40|$|Low beam {{emittance}} is key {{to achieving}} the required spot size at the output focus of the DARHT Second Axis. The nominal electron beam parameters at {{the output of the}} injector are 2 kA, 4. 6 MeV, 2 -microsecond pulse width and an rms radius less than 1 cm. Emittance is measured by bringing the beam to a focus in which the emittance is a dominant influence in determining the spot size. The spot size is measured from Cerenkov or optical transition radiation (OTR) generated from a target intercepted by the beam. The current density in the focused DARHT beam would melt this target in less than 1 / 2 microsec. To prevent this we have designed a DC magnetic transport system that defocuses the beam on the emittance target to prevent overheating, and uses a 125 -ns half period pulsed solenoid to selectively focus the beam for short times during the beam pulse. During the development of the fast-focusing portion of this diagnostic it has been determined that the focusing pulse must rapidly sweep through the focus at the target to an over-focused condition to avoid target damage due to overheating. The fast focus produces {approx} 1 kilogauss field over an effective length of {approx} 50 cm to bring the beam to a focus on the target. The fast focus field is generated with a 12 -turn coil located inside the beam-transport vacuum chamber with the entire fast coil structure within the bore of a D. C. magnet.

40|$|The {{effect of}} demagnetizing the cyclone feed was tested at the Minorca plant under the Iron Ore Cooperative Program. The plant tests were {{conducted}} by Minorca personnel. Tests were run at cyclone feed pressures of 12, 14, and 16 psi with and without the demagnetizing coil being energized. Two test series were run at each pressure on different days. Samples were taken of the rougher concentrate (cyclone feed could not be accurately sampled), cyclone underflow and cyclone overflow. The samples were filtered and dried at Minorca and the dried samples were sent to Coleraine. They were screened through 500 mesh and the individual screen fractions were analyzed for magnetic iron (Satmagan) and silica. Results from the chemistry by size fractions were balanced using the USIMPAC program. There was good agreement between the measured and balanced data. These {{results indicated that the}} main effect of the demagnetizing coil was in the minus 500 mesh fractions. The amount of minus 500 mesh material reporting to the underflow was significantly lower when the coil was energized. Also, the silica content of the minus 500 mesh fraction in the underflow has higher, and the amount of minus 500 mesh material in the cyclone overflow was higher when the coil was on. The USIMPAC program was used with the balance data to calculate the cyclone split size, d 50, and apparent by-pass for the magnetic iron and silica portion of the cyclone <b>feed.</b> Having the <b>coil</b> on or off had little effect on the d 50 values for either the magnetic iron or the silica, but having the coil off increased the magnetic iron apparent by-pass by about 100 percent. Computer simulations using USIMPAC were run using previous plant data and the cyclone parameters determined above. However, this produced unrealistic results, since the previous data had a significantly coarser cyclone split. Since the cyclone splits were essentially unaffected by the coil, simulations were run with the previous data splits and the current apparent by-passes. This simulation showed an increased circulating load, but little overall effect on the line performance. Test work conclusively showed that the use of a demagnetizing coil on the cyclone feed at Minorca will significantly reduce the amount of fine iron reporting to the cyclone underflow, which should improve line performance...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The effect of {{the configuration of the}} confining magnetic field on the operating characteristics of a planar magnetron has been observed. In particular, the heat load and charged particle bombardment of the substrate were measured. A circular planar magnetron was constructed with a magnetic field which could be controlled by the adjustment of the current flowing through coils placed around the circumference and with a separate supply <b>feeding</b> a <b>coil</b> around the centre pole. This allowed the magnetic field configuration to be unbalanced and caused the negative glow plasma to be incident on the substrate. It was found that the "unbalanced" electrically-controlled model could give six times the heat load to a substrate in comparison with a balanced permanent magnet structure. Such a load resulted from the bombardment of the substrate with the plasma (revealed by the measurement of the I-V characteristics), and gave a 30 volt negative bias as well as saturated electron and ion currents of around 90 and 1 mA respectively (a magnetron operating current: 0. 8 A). The heat load was lkWm⁻². This compared to a 1 volt positive bias with current of 1. 4 and 0. 5 mA for the balanced case. This bombardment was used as a neutralised ion beam to enhance film growth during sputtering. The effect of the magnetic field configuration has been observed on the operating characteristics of a planar magnetron. In particular, the deposition rate, the currents to a probe and heat load, {{as a function of the}} outer pole solenoid current, were measured. The deposition rate/input power was constant at 19 mÅ/s/W, independent of the outer pole solenoid current. In the region from 20 to 40 A of the outer pole solenoid current, the configuration of the magnetic field seemed to be concentric and the electrons were confined by it. But from 40 to 80 A, the magnetic field became dispersed outwards along the direction to the magnetron and the electrons followed it. Consequently, following bombardment of the surface by electrons and neutralising ions, the currents to a probe and the heat load, gave a behaviour. The effect of the pressure has been observed on probe current, floating potential and heat load. With the pressure increasing, they decreased. It seems that the mean free path of particles becomes shorter and then scattering of them increases. The influence of the magnetic field strength on the plasma, created at the rear of a substrate, has been observed. In particular, the floating potential and the charged particle bombardment of the substrate were measured. Permanent magnets at the rear of the substrate, outside of the chamber, could make the configuration of the magnetic field change and control the floating potential from - 3 to - 59 V. At the same time, they influenced the current-voltage characteristics of a probe and made it change following the direction of the field. Ti 0 ₂ is a very important thin film material in optics because the refractive index is high and it can also satisfy the requirements of a hard, dense and chemically stable coating. In our study, the effect of the floating potential, and the resulting ion beam bombardment on the properties of Ti 0 ₂ thin films deposited by reactive planar magnetron sputtering, has been observed. In reactive magnetron sputtering of Ti 0 ₂, as the partial pressure of oxygen is increased, reaction products form on the target (it is poisoned) which lead to an unstable situation with the cathode switching from metal to oxide uncontrollably. More sophisticated control techniques are required in order to get a stoichiometric Ti 0 ₂ film. The oxygen flow was controlled by observation of the light emission of the Ti spectral line. This was measured using a band pass filter and a photomultiplier. It maintained the oxygen flow by regulating a piezovalve. The optical emission controller gave a complete range of Ti to oxygen ratios. As a result, we obtained samples with a high refractive index of 2. 52 at 633 nm and a high deposition rate of 4 Å/s. The properties measured were the refractive index, the surface composition and morphology, and the crystallinity. The relationship between the refractive index and the proportions of 'anatase' and 'rutile' crystal structures of the Ti 0 ₂ films was especially considered and the dependence on the floating potential was assessed. Also, Al₂ 0 ₃, Cuo, ZnO have been sputtered and the effect of pressure instability assessed. Their properties were measured...|$|R
40|$|Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) systems {{transfer}} {{electric energy}} {{from a source}} to a load without any wired connection. WPTs are attractive for many industrial applications because of their advantages compared to the wired counterpart, such as no exposed wires, ease of charging, and fearless transmission of power in adverse environmental conditions. Adoption of WPTs to charge the on-board batteries of an electric vehicle (EV) has got attention from some companies, and efforts are being made for development and improvement of the various associated topologies. WPT is achieved through the affordable inductive coupling between two coils termed as transmitter and receiver coil. In EV charging applications, transmitter coils are buried in the road and receiver coils are placed in the vehicle. Inductive WPT of resonant type is commonly used for medium-high power transfer applications like EV charging because it exhibits a greater efficiency. This thesis refers to a WPT system to charge the on-board batteries of an electric city-car considered as a study case. The electric city-car uses four series connected 12 V, 100 A•h VRLA batteries and two in-wheel motors fitted in the rear wheels, each of them able to develop a peak power of 4 kW to propel the car. The work done {{has been carried out}} mainly in three different stages; at first an overview on the wired EV battery chargers and the charging methodologies was carried out. Afterwards, background of different WPT technologies are discussed; a full set of Figures of Merit (FOM) have been defined and are used to characterize the resonant WPTs to the variations in resistive load and coupling coefficient. In the second stage, the WPT system for the study case has been designed. In the third stage, a prototypal of the WPT system has been developed and tested. Design of the WPT system is started by assessing the parameters of the various sections and by estimating the impact of the parameters of the system on its performance. The design process of the coil-coupling has come after an analysis of different structures for the windings, namely helix and spiral, and different shapes for the magnetic core; further to the preliminary results that have shown the advantages of the spiral structure, a more detailed analysis has then been executed on this structure. The coil design has encompassed the determination of the inductive parameters of the two-coil coupling {{as a function of the}} coil distance and axial misalignment. Both the analysis and the design was assisted by a FEM-approach based on the COMSOL code. Design of the power supply stages of the WPT system has consisted of the assessment of values and ratings of a) the capacitors that make resonant the coil-coupling, b) the power devices of the PFC rectifier and of the high frequency inverter (HF) that <b>feeds</b> the transmitting <b>coil,</b> c) the power devices of the converters supplied by the receiver coil: the rectifier diode and the in-cascade chopper that feeds the battery in a controlled way. For the converters that operate at high frequency (inverter and the rectifier in the receiver section), power electronic devices of the latest generation (the so-called Wide Band Gap (WBG) devices) have been used in order to maximize the efficiency of the WPT system. A prototypal WPT battery charger was arranged by using available cards with the power and signal circuits. Relevant experimental activities were: a) measurement of the parameters of the coils, b) desk assembling of the prototype, and c) conducting tests to verify proper operation of the prototype. The thesis work includes also a brief overview of i) emerging topics on WPT systems such as on-line electric vehicle (OLEV), ii) shielding of the magnetic fields produced by a WPT system, and iii) standards on WPT operation. These three issues play a significant role in the advancement of the WPT technology. The thesis work has been carried out at the Laboratory of “Electric systems for automation and automotive” headed by Prof. Giuseppe Buja. The laboratory belongs to the Department of Industrial Engineering of the University of Padova, Italy. ...|$|R
