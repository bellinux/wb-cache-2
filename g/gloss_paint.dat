5|$|In November 1973, as {{a result}} of the planned closure of the Victor SR.2 {{equipped}} No. 543 Squadron, No. 27 Squadron reformed at RAF Scampton equipped with the Vulcan as a replacement in the maritime radar reconnaissance role. The squadron carried out patrols of the seas around the British Isles, including the strategically important GIUK gap between Iceland and the United Kingdom, flying at high level and using the Vulcan's H2S radar to monitor shipping. In peacetime, this could be followed up by visual identification and photography of targets of interest at low level. In wartime, a Vulcan would leave visual identification of potential targets to Buccaneers or Canberras, and could coordinate attacks by Buccaneers against hostile shipping. Though initially equipped with a number of B.2 aircraft, the Squadron eventually operated nine B.2 (MRR) aircraft (also known by the unofficial designation SR.2). The aircraft were modified for the role by removing the Terrain Following Radar (and its thimble radome) and adding the LORAN C radio navigation aid. The main external visual difference was the presence of a <b>gloss</b> <b>paint</b> finish, with a light grey undersurface, to protect against sea spray.|$|E
25|$|AM General {{had planned}} to sell a {{civilian}} version of the Humvee {{as far back as}} the late 1980s. Having the same structure and most mechanical components, the civilian Hummers were finished in automotive <b>gloss</b> <b>paint,</b> adding passenger car enhancements such as air conditioning, sound insulation, upgraded upholstery, stereo systems, wood trim, and convenience packages. The civilian model began in part because of the persistence of Arnold Schwarzenegger, who saw an Army convoy while filming a movie.|$|E
25|$|The Trust {{charges a}} small entry fee to allow {{access to the}} King's Men circle. It emphasises a {{preservation}} ethos, attempting to prevent any damage to the megaliths, and has reinforced the paths around the site, enabling wheelchair access to the Whispering Knights. The sites have experienced vandalism in this period; {{in the summer of}} 2001 a piece of the King Stone was chipped off, while in April 2004, yellow <b>gloss</b> <b>paint</b> was splashed onto the King's Men. Some of these may be protests against the use of the site by modern Pagans. Under the Trust's ownership, the site has been overseen by a paid manager and a number of voluntary wardens. The Trust erected a wardens' hut at the site, from which it sold both archaeological literature and publications by Pagan and earth mysteries groups. In January 2006, the hut was damaged beyond repair in an arson attack, with a group calling itself the Rollright Project holding benefit gigs to raise money for a replacement.|$|E
30|$|Sixteen {{substrates}} {{were chosen}} for the fingermark experiments. These includes non-porous surfaces, such as CD-ROM, phone screen protector, <b>gloss</b> <b>painted</b> wood, stainless steel tool, electrical switch and porcelain crucible, and semi-porous surfaces, such as credit card, brown tape, currency note and translucent plastic.|$|R
50|$|Other {{types of}} dry marker boards are also available, {{such as high}} gloss vinyl and coated paper, which can be rolled up, {{high-density}} two-part high <b>gloss</b> <b>paints,</b> glass and coated acrylics and polypropylene magic whiteboards which use static electricity to cling to walls, windows, and doors.|$|R
50|$|A {{change of}} fashion {{in the late}} 1920s led to a demand for <b>gloss</b> <b>painted</b> bodies and the fabric market disappeared. A system was {{developed}} using metal panels with a similar flexible mounting allowing movement between panels. It was used on coachbuilt bodies {{but it did not}} suit the demands of mass-production.|$|R
2500|$|In 1959, Saint Phalle first {{encountered}} multiple artworks by Yves Klein, Marcel Duchamp, Daniel Spoerri, Willem de Kooning, Jackson Pollock, Robert Rauschenberg, and Jasper Johns. Seeing these avant-garde works triggered her [...] "first great artistic crisis". She switched from oil painting to gouaches and <b>gloss</b> <b>paint,</b> {{and began to}} produce assemblages from household objects and castoffs. By this time, {{she had decided to}} dedicate herself fully to creating art, free from the obligations of everyday family life.|$|E

50|$|In Greece, {{precious}} oils, perfumes, cosmetic powders, eye shadows, skin <b>glosses,</b> <b>paints,</b> beauty unguents, {{and hair}} dyes were in universal use. Export {{and sale of}} these items formed {{an important part of}} trade around the Mediterranean. During the 7th and 8th centuries BC, Corinthian, Rhodian and East Greek traders dominated markets in perfume flasks and cosmetic containers. The containers included aryballoi, alabastra, pyxides and other small specialized shapes.|$|R
50|$|Generally {{measurement}} of reflection haze {{is confined to}} high <b>gloss</b> <b>paints</b> and coatings and highly polished metals. Although {{there has been some}} degree of success using this measurement method for films it has proven unreliable due to variability caused by changes in the film thickness (internal refraction variations) and the background colour on which the film sample is placed. Generally haze {{measurement of}} films is performed using a transmission type hazemeter as described hereafter.|$|R
50|$|In {{traditional}} household interiors, {{walls are}} usually painted in flat or eggshell gloss, wooden trim (including doors and window sash) in high gloss, and ceilings almost invariably in flat. Similarly, exterior trim is usually painted with a <b>gloss</b> <b>paint,</b> while {{the body of}} the house is painted in a lower gloss.|$|E
50|$|Anti-climb paint (also {{known as}} non-drying paint, anti-intruder paint, anti-vandal grease) is {{a class of}} paint {{consisting}} of a thick oily coating that is applied with a stiff brush, trowel or by hand using a protective glove. In appearance it is similar to smooth <b>gloss</b> <b>paint</b> when applied but it remains slippery indefinitely thereby preventing any intruder from gaining a foothold.|$|E
50|$|Many of Davenport's {{works are}} made by pouring paint onto a tilted surface and letting gravity spread the paint over the surface. He has usually worked on medium density {{fibreboard}} rather than canvas, and most often employs household <b>gloss</b> <b>paint,</b> meaning the viewer can see their own reflection in the work. He has {{made a number of}} diptychs and triptychs as well as single works.|$|E

50|$|The {{front panel}} has a volume knob, a master tuning knob, a data entry knob for {{programming}} patches, modulation and pitch wheels with knobs for {{the depth of}} the effect, and various buttons to switch on and off modulation destinations, enable chord memory, transpose the keyboard, or infinitely sustain notes. The case is black metal with fluorescent displays to indicate the status of different synthesis parameters (see Figure 1), and black rubberized end pieces. Other version, possible earlier may have <b>gloss</b> <b>painted</b> wood ends.|$|R
50|$|Hume {{represented}} Great Britain at the 1999 Venice Biennale, {{where he}} showed his Water series, {{a number of}} superimposed line drawings of women (again, these were <b>gloss</b> <b>paint</b> on aluminium). His work {{was the subject of}} a one-person exhibition at Whitechapel Gallery, London, in 1999. Later monographic shows of Hume's work were organised at the Kestnergesellschaft, Hannover, and the Kunsthaus Bregenz, Austria, in 2004, and Modern Art Oxford mounted a survey show of his Door paintings in 2008.|$|E

50|$|As a gloss finish {{will reveal}} surface {{imperfections}} such as sanding marks, surfaces must generally be prepared more thoroughly for gloss finishes. Gloss-finish paints {{are generally more}} resistant to damage than flat paint, more resistant to staining, and easier to clean. Flat paint may become glossier through burnishing or staining with grease; glossy paint may lose its gloss and look scratched if abraded. Unlike <b>gloss</b> <b>paint,</b> flat paint can generally be touched up locally without repainting the entire surface.|$|E
50|$|Standard trim levels {{included}} LS and LX. Starting in 2003 {{there was}} also Business and LS Plus in some markets, both had basic fabric seats. The last trim was called Emblema in the model year 2004, but presented {{for the first time}} in November 2002 at Bologna Motor Show. It was inspired by the classic famous Lancia Flaminia and came with tobacco brown leather interior (optional Alcantara), magnesium dashboard interior parts, exclusive 16 inch (10 spoke) allow wheels, privacy glass and a <b>gloss</b> <b>painted</b> black roof.|$|R
5000|$|The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 {{versions}} garnered generally positive reviews. IGN {{gave the}} game a 9.0 out of 10, {{stating that the}} gameplay changes are [...] "breathing new life into its core mechanics". Mike D'Alonzo of G4 called it [...] "the best wrestling game ever made". However, Andy Hartup of Computer and Video Games gave the game a 6.7 out of 10 and wrote that the game, [...] "offers little more than some new <b>gloss</b> <b>painted</b> over an old product". Game Informer's Dan Ryckert echoed the sentiment, stating, [...] "Thanks to a severely downgraded story mode {{and a lack of}} substantial improvements, this is the weakest WWE title in years." ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Alkyd resin dispersions {{are used}} in the paint {{industry}} {{as the basis for the}} new generation of environmentally friendly <b>gloss</b> <b>paints.</b> This research based on two-component seed oil soybean oil and castor oil to synthesis high-efficiency modified alkyd resin. The experimental conditions are the mass ratio of soybean oil with castor oil is 2 : 1, 55 % degree of oil, Ni(OH) 2 as the catalyst and 210 ˚C~ 220 ˚C for alcohol solution reaction, 220 ˚C for esterification under the protection of nitrogen. The experimental results show that the product non-drying days are more than 30 days, acid value is 6. 6, the migration is 1. 2 %, adhesion is one level, flexibility is 0. 5, chroma value is 8...|$|R

50|$|Hume {{abandoned}} {{doors in}} the mid-1990s, turning to paintings in household <b>gloss</b> <b>paint</b> on aluminium panel, for these often used appropriated images, including pictures of celebrities (e.g. DJ Tony Blackburn) and animals. Their forms and colours are dramatically simplified, with people being reduced to just two or three colours. Snowman (1996), for example, {{is made up of}} three shades of red, showing a circle on top of a larger circle against a lighter background. At first, Hume used mainly bright colours, but later pieces have used more muted tones.|$|E
50|$|Mini-Z is a {{brand name}} for a popular line of 1:27-scale {{electric}} radio-controlled cars manufactured by Kyosho Corporation, a Japanese manufacturer of various radio-controlled devices. Kyosho makes {{a huge number of}} bodies for the Mini-Z. The wheelbase is nominally 94mm but can range from 86mm to 106mm. The bodies are all highly detailed, realistic looking, and fully painted with a high <b>gloss</b> <b>paint.</b> The bodies are so realistic that many are collected as display models and the bodies come with a dummy chassis and wheels for display purposes.|$|E
50|$|Each Project Alpha also {{included}} new lightweight wheels finished in <b>Gloss</b> Black <b>paint</b> with a Diamond Cut finish to the machined surfaces. Power was increased to 616 hp {{and the engine}} compartment received Carbon-Fibre covers. The expected retail price for each MP4-12C Project Alpha was around $335,000.|$|R
50|$|Stands mostly {{come in two}} colors, {{black and}} chrome. Chrome has a {{tendency}} to rust when exposed to moisture from mopped floors, humidity, etc. Black stands suffer from the same problems, but can be repainted with inexpensive black <b>gloss</b> spray <b>paint</b> more cheaply than chrome stands can be rechromed.|$|R

5000|$|... "Candy (Drippin' Like Water)", is {{the third}} single by Snoop Dogg from his 2006 album Tha Blue Carpet Treatment, {{produced}} by Rick Rock. It features E-40, MC Eiht, Goldie Loc and Tha Dogg Pound (Daz Dillinger and Kurupt), and Ladybug on the chorus. The song title and sample come from Ladybug Mecca's vocals on Digable Planets's [...] "9th Wonder (Blackitolism)". [...] "Candy" [...] refers to a high <b>gloss</b> <b>paint</b> finish applied to automobiles. In the song it is also used as a euphemism for marijuana, cocaine and sex.|$|E
5000|$|Early in 1941, {{a number}} of young people with similar {{political}} and religious views like Klingenbeck's formed a group under his leadership. They planned to spread leaflets and built a radio transmitter through which they broadcast opposition propaganda, and called for the overthrow of the Nazi régime. In the summer of 1941, an appeal came over the BBC to spread the [...] "V-for-Victory" [...] sign to herald the foreseen Allied victory in the Second World War, whereupon Klingenbeck did just that, by painting the sign on some forty buildings in Munich with <b>gloss</b> <b>paint.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{impact of}} both apartments is {{generated}} by a sequence of rooms of increasing degrees of decoration. The most decorated room of the Southern Apartment is the Spiegelsaal or Mirror Cabinet. Its walls consist entirely of glass panels, decorated on the back using either paintings, or drawings engraved into a gold ground and then underlaid with dark <b>gloss</b> <b>paint.</b> All the paintings and drawings show oriental, especially Chinese, scenes. The southern part also includes the Toskanasaal. The highlight of the Northern Apartment is the Green Lacquered Room. Its multilayered wall coverings consist of a metallic green color decorated with paintings and golden ornaments.|$|E
50|$|The RB-57s {{were totally}} unarmed. It was painted {{with a high}} <b>gloss</b> black <b>paint</b> which was {{intended}} to minimize detection by searchlights. The crew was two; one pilot and one photo-navigator. It was intended that only a minimum of effort {{would be required to}} convert the RB-57A to a bomber mission, which was never actually done in practice.|$|R
50|$|The brakes {{consist of}} {{radially}} ventilated discs front and rear. The fronts are sized at 385 mm in diameter by 36 mm thick, and are clamped by <b>gloss</b> black <b>painted</b> Continental Teves two-piston sliding calipers. The rear discs are 330 mm by 22 mm thick, and use gloss black Girling-TRW single piston sliding calipers with an integrated electro-mechanical parking brake.|$|R
50|$|Until {{the early}} 1970s red, yellow, orange and green lead-based {{pigments}} (lead chromate) {{were added to}} {{a limited number of}} decorative coloured <b>gloss</b> and wall <b>paints.</b> Following this non-lead alternatives were used as pigments.|$|R
