25|$|I have {{preferred}} to not let this diagnosis {{get in the way}} of getting on with life. I feel a deep frustration at this new roadblock, as <b>I</b> <b>now</b> <b>have</b> to take a step back and undergo treatment. The band means so much to me, and cancelling the tour has been a very sad decision. I am hopeful that in the near future we will be back on the road again playing music we love.|$|E
25|$|Finally, on 1 December, {{the crisis}} ended when Bjelke-Petersen {{announced}} his retirement from politics. He declared: The policies of the National Party are no longer those on which I went to the people. Therefore I have no wish to lead the Government any longer. It was my intention to take this matter {{to the floor of}} State Parliament. However, <b>I</b> <b>now</b> <b>have</b> no further interest in leading the National Party any further.Three months later, Bjelke-Petersen called on voters at the federal by-election in Groom to support the Liberal candidate instead of the National contestant. Bjelke-Petersen said the Nationals had lost their way and turned their backs on traditional conservative policies.|$|E
500|$|Although Borah's career bridged two eras of reform, {{according}} to Ashby, [...] "emotionally and intellectually he belonged {{with the older}} prewar [...] America. [...] As New Deal enthusiast Edgar Kemler observed, he 'was overtaken by obsolescence at an early age'." [...] Borah wrote in 1927, {{near the end of}} a decade of tumultuous change, [...] "I cannot think of any views which <b>I</b> <b>now</b> <b>have</b> that I did not have before the war." [...] In 1936, Time magazine noted that though Borah was the most famous senator of the century, and had long been [...] "the great Moral Force of the Senate... the conscience of the country has been placed in other pockets".|$|E

500|$|Thomas {{included}} Piz dancing humorously at {{the fraternity}} party because he [...] "could watch {{it over and}} over", and there were roughly fifteen minutes of footage of him dancing. The band that plays at the party, the Diamond Smugglers, is from Thomas's hometown of Austin, Texas, and they played at Thomas's wedding and 40th birthday party. The scene near the end with Logan smashing a police car to get intentionally thrown in prison confused the crew, who doubted its artistic and technical plausibility. However, Thomas {{was pleased with the}} final output, and producer Dan Etheridge called it [...] "one of the most compact and interesting visual storytelling pieces in the episode." [...] The episode went over budget. In this episode, Mac wears a shirt that says [...] "Ask Me About My STD", something which several critics commended for its comedic value. Thomas {{came up with the idea}} for the shirt and hired one of the other guest actors in the scene for another episode, commenting [...] "It's funny, I actually made that up, and <b>I</b> <b>now</b> <b>have</b> one, too." [...] In addition, because Thomas was so pleased with the acting in the scene from the boy who hands Mac a whiskey, he hired the actor for a role in a subsequent episode as an important witness to Dean O'Dell's death.|$|E
2500|$|Confessional {{responses}} {{the couple}} received thereafter reached the hundreds. In a podcast with mrbrown, Woo explained the typical reader response was [...] "How {{is it that}} <b>I</b> <b>now</b> <b>have</b> a house, <b>I</b> <b>now</b> <b>have</b> a car, a job, why I am still unhappy?" [...] The couple [...] "felt a responsibility to do something", which inspired them to write the film, the original working title of which was The 5Cs.|$|E
2500|$|Christian writer Regis Nicoll {{claims that}} [...] "Moreover, in a signed, {{handwritten}} letter (a copy of which <b>I</b> <b>now</b> <b>have)</b> sent to Roy Varghese, the legendary philosopher reaffirmed his conversion while criticising Oppenheimer for drawing {{attention away from}} the book’s central argument: the collapse of rationalism." [...] He argues that [...] "Even Mark Oppenheimer described the ex-atheist 'flaunt his allegiance to deism' in May 2006 to a Christian audience at Biola University." ...|$|E

60|$|It was {{impossible}} to hint more delicately at the one request which <b>I</b> <b>now</b> <b>had</b> it in my mind to make to him. I {{took his hand and}} pressed it gratefully.|$|R
60|$|That I {{was indeed}} upon Mars <b>I</b> <b>now</b> <b>had</b> no doubt, for here {{were members of}} the wild hordes that people the dead sea bottoms and deserted cities of that dying planet.|$|R
2500|$|Over {{the years}} as an investor, he {{invested}} his bodybuilding and movie earnings {{in an array of}} stocks, bonds, privately controlled companies, and real estate holdings worldwide, making his net worth as an accurate estimation difficult to calculate, particularly in light of declining real estate values owing to economic recessions in the U.S. and Europe since the late 2000s. In June 1997, Schwarzenegger spent $38million of his own money on a private Gulfstream jet. Schwarzenegger once said of his fortune, [...] "Money doesn't make you happy. <b>I</b> <b>now</b> <b>have</b> $50million, but I was just as happy when I had $48million." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following his Australian {{citizenship}} ceremony, Coetzee {{said that}} [...] "I did {{not so much}} leave South Africa, a country with which I retain strong emotional ties, but come to Australia. I came because {{from the time of}} my first visit in 1991, I was attracted by the free and generous spirit of the people, by the beauty of the land itself and– when I first saw Adelaide– by the grace of the city that <b>I</b> <b>now</b> <b>have</b> the honour of calling my home." [...] When he initially moved to Australia, he had cited the South African government's lax attitude to crime in that country as a reason for the move, leading to a spat with Thabo Mbeki, who, speaking of Coetzee's novel Disgrace stated that [...] "South Africa is not only a place of rape". In 1999, the African National Congress submission to an investigation into racism in the media by the South African Human Rights Commission named Disgrace as a novel exploiting racist stereotypes. However, when Coetzee won his Nobel Prize, Mbeki congratulated him [...] "on behalf of the South African nation and indeed the continent of Africa".|$|E
2500|$|When viewers {{realized}} that Willow was {{falling in love}} with Tara, Whedon remembered that some threatened to boycott the show, complaining [...] "You made Willow a fag", to which he responded, [...] "Bye. We'll miss you a whole lot." [...] However, he also said, [...] "For every (negative) post, there's somebody saying, 'You made my life a lot easier because <b>I</b> <b>now</b> <b>have</b> someone I can relate to on screen'." [...] Gay characters had been portrayed before on television, and at the time the popular sitcom Will & Grace was on the air. Lesbian-themed HBO special If These Walls Could Talk 2 won an Emmy. Twenty-three television shows depicted a gay character of some kind in 2000. However, these other characters were mostly desexualized, none were partnered or shown consistently affectionate towards the same person. Willow and Tara's relationship became the first long-term lesbian relationship on U.S. television. Jane magazine hailed Willow and Tara as a bold representation of gay relationship, remarking that [...] "they hold hands, slow-dance and lay in bed at night. You won't find that kind of normalcy on Will and Grace." [...] Despite Whedon's intentions of not making Buffy about overcoming issues, he said Willow's exploration of her sexuality [...] "turned {{out to be one of}} the most important things we've done on the show".|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>now</b> <b>had</b> in my {{possession}} all {{the papers}} that I wanted--the district registrar's own copy of the certificate of death, and Sir Percival's dated letter to the Count, being safe in my pocket-book.|$|R
60|$|In this amiable light did Fayaway {{appear in}} my eyes; and, reposing full {{confidence}} in her candour and intelligence, <b>I</b> <b>now</b> <b>had</b> recourse to her, {{in the midst}} of my alarm with regard to my companion.|$|R
60|$|She had <b>had</b> her revelation; <b>I</b> <b>now</b> <b>had</b> mine, {{and it was}} an {{exceedingly}} bitter one. I trembled at the thought of confessing my secret to her, <b>now</b> when she <b>had</b> so unmistakably responded to the passion I had insanely revealed.|$|R

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>now</b> <b>had</b> {{the precise}} {{feeling of the}} penniless outcast. With morbidly active {{imagination}} I conceived {{of myself as a}} being forever set apart from home and friends, condemned to wander the night alone. I worked on this idea till I achieved a bitter, furtive and ferocious manner.|$|R
60|$|With {{the plan}} of {{proceeding}} which <b>I</b> <b>now</b> <b>had</b> in view, it was first necessary to possess the complete list of the guests.

50|$|The title track, {{backed with}} I Need It, was issued {{as a single}}, and Time <b>Is</b> <b>Now</b> <b>had</b> been covered as a single by {{contemporary}} group Jericho Jones on the A&M label the previous year. Although neither of these singles or the album ever made the UK charts, the latter received positive reviews from several music journalists who had never found Mungo Jerry to their personal taste.|$|R
