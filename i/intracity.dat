5|$|The Egged Ta'avura {{company has}} been {{operating}} urban buses in Ashdod since 2007. In addition, a share taxi service exists in Ashdod, operated by Moniyot HaIr. Most share taxi lines coincide with <b>intracity</b> bus lines.|$|E
5|$|The main {{bus stand}} (popularly {{known as the}} New Bus Stand), opened in 2003, is located in Veinthaankulam and there is regular bus service {{to and from the}} city. Other bus stands (for <b>intracity</b> service) are the Junction and Palay bus stands. The Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation has daily service to a number of cities, and the {{corporation}} operates a computerised reservation centre in the main bus stand. It also operates local buses serving the city and neighbouring villages. The State Express Transport Corporation has intercity service to Bangalore, Chennai, Kanyakumari and other cities.|$|E
25|$|Alexandria's <b>intracity</b> {{commuter}} rail system extends from Misr Station (Alexandria's primary intercity railway station) to Abu Qir, {{parallel to the}} tram line. The commuter line's locomotives operate on diesel, {{as opposed to the}} overhead-electric tram.|$|E
25|$|A {{passenger}} train travels between stations where passengers may embark and disembark. The {{oversight of the}} train {{is the duty of}} a guard/train manager/conductor. Passenger trains are part of public transport and often make up the stem of the service, with buses feeding to stations. Passenger trains provide long-distance intercity travel, daily commuter trips, or local urban transit services. They even include a diversity of vehicles, operating speeds, right-of-way requirements, and service frequency. Passenger trains usually can be divided into two operations: intercity railway and <b>intracity</b> transit. Whereas as intercity railway involve higher speeds, longer routes, and lower frequency (usually scheduled), <b>intracity</b> transit involves lower speeds, shorter routes, and higher frequency (especially during peak hours).|$|E
25|$|Automobiles {{dominate}} <b>intracity</b> {{and local}} area transport. There is limited fixed-route city transit service (Minot City Transit) on weekdays, and flexible-route rural transit service (Souris Basin Transportation) on an occasional basis. Local transit {{services for the}} elderly and disabled (Minot Commission on Aging Transit) meet federal guidelines but have 24-hour advance notice requirements.|$|E
25|$|The Regional Transportation Commission of Washoe County (RTC) has a {{bus system}} that {{provides}} <b>intracity</b> buses, intercity buses to Carson City, and an on-demand shuttle service for disabled persons. The bus system has its main terminal on 4th Street in downtown Reno and secondary terminals in Sparks and at Meadowood Mall in south Reno.|$|E
25|$|Railways are Kiev’s main mode of <b>intracity</b> and {{suburban}} transportation. The {{city has a}} developed railroad infrastructure including a long-distance passenger station, 6 cargo stations, depots, and repairing facilities. However, this system still fails {{to meet the demand}} for passenger service. Particularly, the Kiev Passenger Railway Station is the city's only long-distance passenger terminal (vokzal).|$|E
25|$|Rice hosted {{its first}} conference tournament in 2006 and drew 18,137 fans to the tournament's seven sessions, {{averaging}} 2,591 fans per session. The championship game, featuring <b>intracity</b> rivals Rice and Houston, drew 3,732 fans. The Owls also hosted NCAA regional and super regional tournaments, pushing total attendance to a school-record total of 131,467 and a school-record average of 3,287 fans per game, narrowly outdrawing the 2004 season.|$|E
25|$|Expressways in Kuala Lumpur are tolled roads. They {{serve as}} an {{alternative}} during peak periods at which time some parts of Kuala Lumpur's ring roads become highly congested. Kuala Lumpur is well connected by many <b>intracity</b> expressways such as the Ampang–Kuala Lumpur Elevated Highway. Moreover, Kuala Lumpur is the home for the world's first SMART Tunnel, which is a unique solution to Kuala Lumpur's long-term traffic problems and floodwater mitigation woes.|$|E
25|$|Metra {{services}} passengers through stations {{throughout the}} Chicago metropolitan area. Each station, unless a route or branch terminus, provides travel toward (inbound) {{and away from}} (outbound) downtown Chicago. Therefore, a passenger can connect between the city and a suburb or between two points in the suburbs using Metra service. Although Metra's commuter rail system is designed to connect points all over the Chicago metropolitan area, it does provide some <b>intracity</b> connections within Chicago.|$|E
25|$|When opened, the Chennai Mofussil Bus Terminus (CMBT) was {{the largest}} bus station in Asia. It is the main {{intercity}} bus station of Chennai, administered by 7 government-owned transport corporations, which operate intercity and interstate bus services. There are many private bus companies that provide similar transport services. The MTC provides an exclusive <b>intracity</b> bus service, consisting of 3,421 buses on 724 routes, which provides transportation to 55.2lakh passengers daily. The Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation operates Volvo air-conditioned services from Chennai to nearby cities like Pondicherry, Vellore, Hosur and Trichy.|$|E
25|$|Egged buses {{run from}} the Netanya central bus station to Jerusalem, Haifa, Eilat and other destinations. Many neighborhoods have a direct {{connection}} to Tel Aviv without the need {{to pass through the}} central bus station. In addition, many Egged lines connecting Tel Aviv with the north of the country stop at the Netanya Interchange on Highway 2, giving Netanya a direct connection with Nazareth, Tiberias, Kiryat Shmona and many other northern destinations. Nateev Express operates bus services to Tel Aviv, Bnei Brak and to the surrounding communities, including the city of Hadera. Some regional lines are still operated by Egged. The <b>intracity</b> transportation is based on Egged Ta'avura bus lines and Shay Li service taxis.|$|E
25|$|The {{city also}} has several major surface arteries. U.S. Route 1 (Columbus Avenue, Union Avenue, Water Street, Forbes Avenue) runs in an east-west {{direction}} south of downtown serving Union Station and leading {{out of the}} city to Milford, West Haven, East Haven and Branford. The main road from downtown heading northwest is Whalley Avenue (partly signed as Route 10 and Route 63) leading to Westville and Woodbridge. Heading north towards Hamden, there are two major thoroughfares, Dixwell Avenue and Whitney Avenue. To the northeast are Middletown Avenue (Route 17), which leads to the Montowese section of North Haven, and Foxon Boulevard (Route 80), which leads to the Foxon section of East Haven and to the town of North Branford. To the west is Route 34, which leads to the city of Derby. Other major <b>intracity</b> arteries are Ella Grasso Boulevard (Route 10) west of downtown, and College Street, Temple Street, Church Street, Elm Street, and Grove Street in the downtown area.|$|E
25|$|On 11 February 2014, SWM/MVG {{announced}} a detailed {{report for the}} construction of new bypass line, a fourth <b>intracity</b> underground line, to be called the U9. The new line will relieve the overburdened U1/U2/U7/U8 and U3/U6 lines, especially the transfer stations at Sendlinger Tor (U1/U2/U7/U8 and U3/U6), Central Station (U1/U2/U7/U8 and U4/U5), and Odeonsplatz (U3/U6 and U4/U5), and will shorten the travel time between the Central Station and the Allianz Arena by removing the need to transfer at Marienplatz or Odeonsplatz. MVG is predicting tremendous growth of passenger traffic in the northern section of Munich in the next twenty years and wanted to plan accordingly. The U9 line is projected to carry ten million passengers per year and to cost between 250 and 360 million euros, with an estimated completion date of 2025 if funding were approved. Three proposed booster lines — U10, U11, and U12 — would take advantage of new U9 bypass line; however, these booster lines are still under discussion.|$|E
25|$|Rapid transit is an <b>intracity</b> system {{built in}} large cities and has the highest {{capacity}} of any passenger transport system. It is usually grade-separated and commonly built underground or elevated. At street level, smaller trams can be used. Light rails are upgraded trams that have step-free access, their own right-of-way and sometimes sections underground. Monorail systems are elevated, medium-capacity systems. A people mover is a driverless, grade-separated train that serves only a few stations, as a shuttle. Due {{to the lack of}} uniformity of rapid transit systems, route alignment varies, with diverse rights-of-way (private land, side of road, street median) and geometric characteristics (sharp or broad curves, steep or gentle grades). For instance, the Chicago 'L' trains are designed with extremely short cars to negotiate the sharp curves in the Loop. New Jersey's PATH has similar-sized cars to accommodate curves in the trans-Hudson tunnels. San Francisco's BART operates large cars on its well-engineered routes.|$|E
25|$|Passengers on the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Railroad {{were charged}} a strike fare of US$4.00 for <b>intracity</b> travel. Metro-North Railroad {{had a special}} East Bronx shuttle (making all Harlem Line stops from Mount Vernon West to Grand Central Terminal, but {{bypassing}} Tremont and Melrose) by December 21. Regular peak trains did not stop in the Bronx. There were similar plans on the Hudson Line, and in addition there was a special park and ride lot near Yankee Stadium, and at Shea Stadium in Queens. The New Haven Line ran normally, stopping at Fordham only in the Bronx, as usual. Long Island Rail Road customers also faced service changes. There was no service to Bellerose, Hollis, Rosedale, Locust Manor, Saint Albans, or Hunterspoint Avenue during rush hours. Shuttle trains operated between Jamaica/Great Neck and Penn Station. During middays, additional shuttle service was provided to Bellerose and Long Island City. During the strike, the LIRR recorded a 60% increase in daily ridership compared to before the strike, and the Metro-North recorded a 40% increase.|$|E
25|$|With the {{construction}} of the Berlin Wall on 13 August 1961, along the <b>intracity</b> frontier, Potsdamer Platz now found itself physically divided in two. What had once been a busy intersection had become totally desolate. With the clearance of most of the remaining bomb-damaged buildings on both sides (on the eastern side, this was done chiefly to give border guards a clear view of would-be escapees and an uninterrupted line of fire), little was left in an area of dozens of hectares. Further demolitions occurred up until 1976 when the Haus Vaterland finally disappeared. After that, only two buildings in the immediate vicinity of Potsdamer Platz still stood– one complete, the other in a half-ruined fragmented form: the Weinhaus Huth's steel skeleton had enabled the building to withstand the pounding of World War II virtually undamaged, and it stood out starkly amid a great levelled wasteland, although now occupied only by groups of squatters. A short distance away stood portions of the former Hotel Esplanade, including the Kaisersaal, used at various times as a much scaled-down hotel, cinema, nightclub and occasional film-set (scenes from Cabaret were shot there). Apart from these, no other buildings remained. Below ground, the U-Bahn section through Potsdamer Platz had closed entirely; although the S-Bahn line itself remained open, it suffered from a quirk of geography in that it briefly passed through East German territory en route from one part of West Berlin to another. Consequently, Potsdamer Platz S-Bahn station became the most infamous of several Geisterbahnhofe (ghost stations), through which trains ran without stopping, its previously bustling platforms now decrepit, sealed off from the outside world, and patrolled by armed guards.|$|E
500|$|A new central {{bus station}} opened in 1996. It {{serves as the}} {{terminus}} both for inter- and <b>intracity</b> lines. The central bus station {{is attached to the}} City Mall.

500|$|On August 14, 1957, the routing {{of what is}} now I-190 (including the then-partially {{complete}} Niagara Thruway) {{was originally}} designated as I-90N, as intercity routes were assigned before three-digit Interstate numbers were applied to the shorter <b>intracity</b> routes. I-90N was renumbered to I-190 on February 24, 1959. Construction on the portion of I-190 north of NY384 began [...] and was completed by 1964.|$|E

The geology is highly variegated within the area, with uplifted and folded ridges visible within the shoreline {{of some of the}} lakes surrounding Ardmore. The city of Ardmore has no <b>intracity</b> streams or rivers, but is part of the Washita and Red River watersheds, with two tributaries, Caddo and Hickory creeks, flanking the broad, low area in which Ardmore is situated.

2500|$|Port Authority of Allegheny County, {{commonly}} known as the Port Authority, but sometimes referred to by its former nickname [...] "PAT" [...] or [...] "PAT Transit", is the region's mass transit system. While serving only a portion of the Pittsburgh area (the nation's 20th largest metro area), it is the 11th largest transit agency in the nation and helped the region rank 8th on commuters that use non-car means to work, second to only Chicago in metros outside the Northeast corridor. [...] Port Authority runs a network of <b>intracity</b> and intercity bus routes, the Monongahela Incline funicular railway (more {{commonly known}} as an [...] "incline") on Mount Washington, a light rail system that runs mostly above-ground in the suburbs and underground as a subway in the city, and one of the nation's largest busway systems.

2500|$|Buses {{operated}} by Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) {{are an important}} and reliable means of public transport available in the city. While commuters can buy tickets on boarding these buses, BMTC also provides an option of a bus pass to frequent users. BMTC runs air-conditioned luxury buses on major routes, and also operates shuttle services from {{various parts of the}} city to Kempegowda International Airport [...] The BMTC also has a mobile app that provides real-time location of a bus using the global positioning system of the user's mobile device. The Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation operates 6,918 buses on 6,352 schedules, connecting Bangalore with other parts of Karnataka as well as other neighbouring states. The main bus depots that KSRTC maintains are the Kempegowda Bus Station, locally known as [...] "Majestic bus stand", where most of the out station buses ply from. Some of the KSRTC buses to Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh ply from Shantinagar Bus Station, Satellite Bus Station at Mysore road and Baiyappanahalli satellite bus station. BMTC and KSRTC were the first operators in India to introduce Volvo city buses and <b>intracity</b> coaches in India.|$|E
2500|$|The Giants and Jets {{for many}} years had the only <b>intracity</b> rivalry in the NFL, made even more unusual by sharing a stadium. They have met {{annually}} in the preseason since 1969. Since 2011, this meeting has been known as the [...] "MetLife Bowl", after the naming sponsor of the teams' stadium. Regular season matchups between the teams occur once every four years, as they follow the NFL scheduling formula for interconference games. Since the two teams play each other so infrequently in the regular season, some, including players on both teams, have questioned whether the Giants and Jets have a real rivalry. A memorable regular season game was in 1988, when the Giants faced off against the Jets in the last game of the season, needing a victory to make the playoffs. The Jets played spoiler, however, beating the Giants 27–21 and ruining the latter's playoff hopes. A different scenario unfolded during the penultimate regular season game of 2011 as the [...] "visiting" [...] Giants defeated the Jets 29–14. The victory simultaneously helped eliminate the Jets from playoff contention and propel the Giants to their own playoff run and eventual win in Super Bowl XLVI. The Giants lead the overall regular season series 8–5 and have won five of the past six meetings.|$|E

A {{telecommunications}} database known as the Regional Telecommunications Center or La Regional was integrated into this agency and served as {{a vital part of the}} Guatemalan intelligence network. La Regional provided a link between the Presidential Intelligence Agency and all of the main security bodies, including the National Police, the Treasury Guard, the Judicial Police, by way of a VHF-FM <b>intracity</b> frequency. La Regional was also used by the government as a depository for records on suspected [...] "subversives", which was the basis on which target lists for [...] "death squads" [...] were compiled. Orders to carry out assassinations and [...] "disappearances" [...] were often passed down the hierarchy to lower level security forces such as the Judicial Police (later renamed as the Detective Corps of the National Police and the DIT) or the Treasury Guard, whose agents – known as confidenciales – who could be called from provincial army garrisons to be sent to the capital for unspecified purposes. Treasury Police and National Police confidenciales could also be contracted either through provincial army commanders or by direct contact with provincial commanders of the police services.
