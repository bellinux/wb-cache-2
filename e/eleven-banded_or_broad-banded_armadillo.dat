40|$|The {{response}} of {{the period of the}} quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) to increases in tropical upwelling are considered using a one-dimensional model. We find that the imposition of the annual cycle in tropical upwelling creates substantial variability in the period of the QBO. The annual cycle creates synchronisation regions in the wave forcing space, within which the QBO period locks onto an integer multiple of the annual forcing period. Outside of these regions, the QBO period undergoes discrete jumps as it attempts to find a stable relationship with the oscillator forcing. The resulting set of QBO periods can be either discrete <b>or</b> <b>broad-banded,</b> depending on the intrinsic period of the QBO. We use the same model to study the evolution of the QBO period as the strength of tropical upwelling increases as would be expected in a warmer climate. The QBO period lengthens and migrates closer towards 36 and 48 month locking regions as upwelling increases. The QBO period does not vary continuously with increased upwelling, however, but instead transitions through a series of 2 - and 3 -cycles before becoming locked to the annual cycle. Finally, some observational evidence for the cyclical behaviour of the QBO periods in the real atmosphere is presented. </p...|$|R

Such a framework is needed for the study of extrasolar planets and objects within the solar system. We have undertaken observations to compile a library of planet spectra for all planets, some moons, and some dwarf planets in the solar system to study their general spectroscopic and photometric natures. During May and November of 2008, we acquired spectra for the planets using TRISPEC, which is capable of simultaneous three-band spectroscopy in a wide wavelength range of 0. 45 - 2. 5 microns with low resolving power (lambda-over-Delta-lambda is 140 - 360).

40|$|A {{survey is}} given of the {{literature}} concerning the scattering properties of infinite plane wire gratings when illuminated by plane electromagnetic waves. As an introduction, {{a summary of the}} applications of wire gratings is included. A description is given of some alternative methods of treating the scattering problem, with particular reference to the application of Green's function to the single cylinder and its application to the plane grating. The literature concerned with multiple grating configurations is also surveyed. A polarisation cascade matrix is derived which describes the transmission of a normally incident elliptically polarised wave through a grating of parallel wires whose angle is arbitrary. The terms of the matrix contain the well-established complex reflection and transmission coefficients for a linearly polarised plane wave incident upon a grating. Hence the matrix can be adapted for gratings of strips or Wires of non-circular cross-section. The product of a series of matrices representing a series of gratings whose wires are at different angles to a fixed direction gives the total complex transmission and reflection coefficients. The results are shown to be in agreement with previously published work on a double grating system and experimentally verified for configurations of two and five gratings. These results confirm that such a series of gratings can be used to design either broad-band polarisation rotators for linear polarization, <b>or</b> <b>broad-band</b> circular <b>or</b> elliptical polarisers or analysers.

40|$|A {{phase sensor}} has been {{developed}} for use in aligning a segmented telescope mirror to within {{a fraction of a}} wavelength in piston. (As used here, piston signifies displacement of a mirror segment along the optical axis of the telescope.) Such precise alignment is necessary in order to realize the full benefit of the large aperture achievable through segmentation. This phase sensor is achromatic. It is based on two-wavelength shearing interferometry, and can be modified to utilize an extended <b>or</b> <b>broad-band</b> (e. g., white) light source. The sensor optics include a ruled diffraction grating and an imaging lens. The sensor can measure the piston shift between segments as well as aberrations of the segments. It can measure the surface error of an individual segment, making it possible to compensate for the error with optimal amount(s) of piston and/or tilt. The precise capture range of the sensor depends partly on the telescope design; the largest relative piston shifts measurable by use of this sensor are of the order of 100 m. The accuracy of the sensor also depends partly on the telescope design; in general, the accuracy is sufficient to enable alignment to within approximately half a wavelength. The interferometric image is digitized and processed by a simple algorithm in real time, and the output of the algorithm can be used to maintain alignment in real time, even in the presence of atmospheric turbulence. The sensor is robust. Through calibration, it can be made insensitive to (and, hence, tolerant of) misalignments and aberrations of its own optics, most aberrations of the telescope as a whole (in contradistinction to aberrations of individual segments), and most aberrations introduced by atmospheric turbulenc...|$|R
2500|$|Astronomy is very {{sensitive}} to light pollution. The night sky viewed from a city bears no resemblance to what {{can be seen from}} dark skies. Skyglow (the scattering of light in the atmosphere) reduces the contrast between stars and galaxies and the sky itself, making it much harder to see fainter objects. This is one factor that has caused newer telescopes to be built in increasingly remote areas. Some astronomers use narrow-band [...] "nebula filters" [...] which only allow specific wavelengths of light commonly seen in nebulae, <b>or</b> <b>broad-band</b> [...] "light pollution filters" [...] which are designed to reduce (but not eliminate) the effects of light pollution by filtering out spectral lines commonly emitted by sodium- and mercury-vapor lamps, thus enhancing contrast and improving the view of dim objects such as galaxies and nebulae. Unfortunately these light pollution reduction (LPR) filters are not a cure for light pollution. LPR filters reduce the brightness of the object under study and this limits the use of higher magnifications. LPR filters work by blocking light of certain wavelengths, which alters the color of the object, often creating a pronounced green cast. Furthermore, LPR filters only work on certain object types (mainly emission nebulae) and are of little use on galaxies and stars. No filter can match the effectiveness of a dark sky for visual or photographic purposes. Due to their low surface brightness, the visibility of diffuse sky objects such as nebulae and galaxies is affected by light pollution more than are stars. Most such objects are rendered invisible in heavily light polluted skies around major cities. A simple method for estimating the darkness of a location is to look for the Milky Way, which from truly dark skies appears bright enough to cast a shadow.|$|R

40|$|We present short Chandra {{observations}} of twelve bright (i< 18) zem∼ 1. 5 quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey chosen to have significantly redder optical colors than most quasars {{at the same}} redshift. Of the five quasars with optical properties most consistent with dust reddening at the quasar redshift, four show indirect evidence of moderate X-ray absorption (inferred NH ∼ 10 22 cm − 2) with a dust-to-gas ratio < 1 % of the SMC value. The remaining seven objects show no evidence for even moderate intrinsic X-ray absorption. Thus, while optically red quasars are marginally more likely to show signatures of X-ray absorption than optically selected quasars with normal colors, dust-reddened type 1 AGN (as opposed to fully obscured type 2 AGN) are unlikely to contribute significantly to the remaining unresolved hard X-ray background. The red quasar population includes objects with intrinsically red continua as well as objects with dust-reddened continua. Improved sample selection is thus needed to increase our understanding of either subpopulation.

Compared to rattle or beeper-based tonal balls, it allows for arbitrary and sensor-adaptive outputs. As a sporting aid for low-vision, this makes participation in team sports more accessible. By being programmable, the participation can be tailored to the individual. It then begs the question of “what tone to play? ” This paper presents an exploitative evaluation of tone bandwidth (i. e., a narrow-band “ping ” <b>or</b> a <b>broad-band</b> “rustle ” sound) and tone volume (quiet to load) in environments with increasing with levels of white background noise {{with a focus on}} the ball (source) localization. This was evaluated with blindfolded subjects in an acoustic source localization task (au-dible angle perception). Initial show that while the narrow-band tone had better (more accurate angle localization) performance in some select cases, the broad-band “rustle ” sound had better performance in general, especially in high noise, which is in keeping with a cross-correlation mechanism for localization. Output levels are more nuanced than direct signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) maximization. They show that louder sounds (higher SNR) is not always better and similarly more noise (lower SNR) is not always worse. This suggests that to aid interaction, that the nature of the tones generated by an interactive aid should factor external factors so as to better aid perceptual localization performance. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of nonlinear optical phenomena in adding functionality to nanostructures like nanoparticles or photonic crystal waveguides are presented. The role of field localization and system resonances {{is discussed in}} the light of few examples in which harmonic generation is being drastically enhanced by these effects. In particular the results on single nanoparticle harmonic response are discussed as the basic example of nonlinear interaction of intense radiation with a single nanoparticle. Here the driving resonance mechanism of nonlinear interaction is proven to be due to surface plasmon oscillations that give rise to strong harmonic enhancement when proper resonance conditions are established. This response in further enriched when assemblies of nanoparticles are considered next, illustrating the role of the surrounding medium, particle shape and orientation and temperature. Switching from metals to semiconductors leads to exploitation of photonic resonances as opposed to plasmonic ones of previous examples. In photonic planar structures the nonlinear response gains also from the notion of quasi-phase matching introduced by the periodicity of the system and from exploiting leaky (or quasi-guided) optical modes that considerably expand the possibilities for an optimised output. Examples based on second and third harmonic generation from such systems are discussed in details. Finally, potential new routes for exploiting higher harmonic efficiencies <b>or</b> very <b>broad-band</b> resonance conditions are briefly mentioned...|$|R

The early history of dermatological phototherapy in Scotland is summarised as an introduction to the more recent developments described in a chapter on the Scottish phototherapy and photochemotherapy audit of 1996 / 1997 (funded by the Clinical Resource and Audit Group, the Scottish Office). This audit revealed {{some aspects of}} the phototherapy service that could be improved, and identified areas of particular importance for future research. Firstly, what type of UVB phototherapy lamp is most effective: the narrow-band (311 - 313 nm) TL- 01 lamp, <b>or</b> the <b>broad-band</b> UVB lamp? A meta-analysis conducted as part of this thesis gave a clear answer. TL- 01 UVB is much more effective than broad-band UVB. The second included study was a randomised, controlled study that has contributed to deciding the optimal treatment frequency for TL- 01 UVB phototherapy of psoriasis. Although 5 x weekly treatment cleared psoriasis slightly more quickly than 3 x weekly treatment, the difference in speed of clearance was too small to warrant the significantly greater frequency of acute erythema during treatment, and the greater number of exposures and dose required. The final question, answered by a randomised, controlled trial, in conjunction with a systematic review of the previous literature, was: for chronic plaque psoriasis, is TL- 01 UVB or psoralen-UVA photochemotherapy to be preferred? The study conducted for this thesis showed TL- 01 UVB to be more effective. Heterogeneity in findings of the studies addressing this question highlighted the importance of the particular treatment regimens selected for comparison, but the overall conclusion was that TL- 01 UVB is the first choice of these two therapies...|$|R

Constant sequencing as well as intense masking sounds basically lead to N 1 m response amplitude reduction. However, the interaction between these two factors has not been investigated so far. Here, we presented subjects tone stimuli of different frequencies, which were either concatenated in blocks of constant frequency or in blocks of randomly changing frequencies. The tones were presented either in silence <b>or</b> together with <b>broad-band</b> noises of varying levels. Results: In silence, tones presented with random sequencing elicited a larger N 1 m response than tones presented with constant sequencing. With increasing noise level, this difference decreased and even vanished in the condition where noise intensity exceeded the tone intensity by 10 dB.

40|$|The inverse Compton {{scattering}} {{of the cosmic}} microwave background (CMB) radiation with electrons in the intracluster medium which has a temperature gradient, was examined by the third-order perturbation theory of the Compton scattering. A new type of the spectrum distortion of the CMB was found and named as gradient T Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (gradT SZE). The spectrum has an universal shape. The spectrum crosses over zero at 326 GHz. The sign of the spectrum depends on the relative direction of the line-of-sight to the direction of the temperature gradient. This unique spectrum shape can be used to detect the gradT SZE signal by <b>broad-band</b> <b>or</b> multi-frequency observations of the SZE. The amplitude of the spectrum distortion does not depend on the electron density and is proportional to the heat conductivity. Therefore, the gradT SZE provides an unique opportunity to measure thermally nonequilibrium electron momentum distribution function when the ICM has a temperature gradient and the heat conductivity in the ICM. However, the expected amplitude of the signal is very small. The modifications to the thermal SZE spectrum due to variety of known effects, such as relativistic correction etc., can become problematic when using multi-frequency separation techniques to detect the gradT SZE signal.

40|$|Staining for the {{mitochondrial}} enzyme {{cytochrome oxidase}} reveals {{an array of}} dense regions (blobs) in the primate primary visual cortex. They are most obvious in the upper layers, 2 and 3, but {{can also be seen}} in layers 4 B, 5, and 6, in register with the blobs in layers 2 and 3. We compared cells inside and outside blobs in macaque and squirrel monkeys, looking at their physiological responses and anatomical connections. Cells within blobs did not show orientation selectivity, whereas cells between blobs were highly orientation selective. Receptive fields of blob cells had circular symmetry and were of three main types, Broad-Band Center-Surround, Red-Green Double-Opponent, and Yellow-Blue Double-Opponent. Double-Opponent cells responded poorly or not at all to white light in any form, or to diffuse light at any wavelength. In contrast to blob cells, none of the cells recorded in layer 4 Cp were Double-Opponent: like the majority of cells in the parvocellular geniculate layers, they were either <b>Broad-Band</b> <b>or</b> Color-Opponent Center-Surround, e. g., red-oncenter green-off-surround.

40|$|Mass {{spectrometry}} (MS) and tandem {{mass spectrometry}} (MSn) approaches {{play vital roles}} in the molecular analysis of {{many different types of}} analytes (e. g., proteins, peptides, etc.). The typical molecular mass spectrometry experiment involves making/sampling ions, probing ions, and transmitting/measuring ions. While the work described herein covers a broad range of technical mass spectrometry instrumentation and experimentation topics on each of these three main segments, the fundamental study of physical and chemical ionic behaviors is a common theme throughout. ^ A technique which has been previously developed to manipulate droplets generated via electrospray ionization (ESI) during the ionization process (viz. the making/sampling phase) was quantified using a mathematical model. This technique involves the controlled introduction of volatile acidic and basic reagents into the interface region of the mass spectrometer where electrospray droplets are undergoing desolvation on the sub-millisecond time scale. Quantitative pH results from this model show good correlation with experimental results. ^ Several projects were also completed involving ion transmission phases. One such projected was the construction and implementation of a miniature ion funnel interface, based off of the design reported by Julian et al. This interface is designed to increase the transmission efficiency (100 x) of ions generated via atmospheric ionization techniques into the high vacuum region of the mass spectrometer. Once the ions are inside the mass spectrometer, it was discovered that introducing a monopolar DC field during a number steps in a typical 3 -D ion trap MS experiments could result in significant enhancements in instrument performance (e. g., ion accumulation efficiency, ion/ion reaction control, mass analysis). The final phase of a mass spectrometry experiment involves measuring and detecting the ions. A novel method for performing mass analysis in a 3 -D ion trap was developed and characterized which involves scanning the quadrupolar DC potential applied to the ion trap while holding the RF potential. This `downscan 2 ̆ 7 can offer some advantages over the traditional RF scan for ions of high m/z values, including a larger scanable mass range as well as the opportunity for improved resolution at high mass. ^ Perhaps more chemically interesting is the work herein devoted to the development and characterization of several different methods to structurally interrogate ions (viz. the 2 ̆ 2 probing 2 ̆ 2 phase). The design and development of two ion activation approaches using a 3 -D ion trap mass spectrometer, dipolar direct current collision induced dissociation (DDC CID) and photodissociation (PD), have been other major areas of research. Interesting characteristics of DDC CID, relative to the conventional single-frequency resonance excitation approach commonly employed, are its non-resonant <b>or</b> <b>broad-band</b> nature and the fact that ions of all m/z values are activated simultaneously. ^ Key to the information derived from activation techniques such as the one mentioned above and from reactions performed inside the mass spectrometer is the ion type. Our research group is actively pursuing targeted chemical derivatization techniques that can be performed via ion/ion reactions (viz. reactions involving a cation and anion) in the gas-phase as part of MSn workflows for biopolymer characterization. Here, this targeted gas-phase chemistry is extended to analytes containing carboxylic acid groups and carboxylate groups using carbodiimide and fixed charge ammonium reagents, respectively. ^ In the spirit of exploring a wider range of chemistries, studies have been conducted involving non-covalently-bound cluster ions as reagent ion types. Relatively stable non-covalent cluster-type ion complexes have been used as multi-functional reagents in ion/ion reactions. This type of methodology allows for multiple covalent modifications to be achieved in a single ion/ion encounter and at the `cost 2 ̆ 7 of only a single analyte charge. These experiments spurred further investigation into the surprisingly gas phase reactive behavior of arginine residues cationized with sodium towards sulfo-NHS ester reagents. Additionally, another area of research aims to implement a means to cool a 3 -D ion trap so as to extend the lifetimes of solvated ions, which are typically short lived under ambient MS conditions. This instrumentation opens up numerous avenues for both fundamental and applicative studies {{of a wide variety of}} different chemical reactions, allowing the study of solution-phase-limited reactions using the inherent benefits of mass spectrometric analysis. This instrumentation design currently involves the use of copper blocks connected to the end-cap electrodes that are be cooled via their attachment to a custom built, in-vacuum liquid nitrogen dewar. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the general}} {{scenario}} of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMP), dark matter (DM) {{can be observed}} via astrophysical gamma rays because photons are produced in various DM annihilation or decay processes, either as <b>broad-band</b> <b>or</b> line emission, or because of the secondary processes of charged particles {{in the final stages}} of the annihilations or the decays. The energy range of the former processes is accessible by current ground-based Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs, like H. E. S. S., MAGIC and VERITAS). The strengths of this technique are: a) the expected DM gamma-ray spectra show peculiar features like bumps, spikes and cutoff that make them clearly distinguishable from the smoother astrophysical spectra, b) the expected DM spectrum is universal and therefore by observing two or more DM targets with the same spectrum, a clear identification (besides detection) of DM would be enabled. The role of IACTs may gain more importance in the future as the results from the LHC may hint to a DM particle with mass at the TeV or above, where the IACTs sensitivity is unsurpassed by other experiments. In this contribution, a review of the search for DM with the current generation of IACT will be presented. Comment: Proceedings of the 4 th RICAP Conference (Rome, 2013).

40|$|We present {{simultaneous}} Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) and Suzaku {{observations of}} the X-ray binary Cygnus X- 1 in the hard state. This {{is the first time}} this state has been observed in Cyg X- 1 with NuSTAR, which enables us to study the reflection and broad-band spectra in unprecedented detail. We confirm that the iron line cannot be fit with a combination of narrow lines and absorption features, and instead requires a relativistically blurred profile in combination with a narrow line and absorption from the companion wind. We use the reflection models of Garcia et al. (2014) to simultaneously measure the black hole spin, disk inner radius, and coronal height in a self-consistent manner. Detailed fits to the iron line profile indicate a high level of relativistic blurring, indicative of reflection from the inner accretion disk. We find a high spin, a small inner disk radius, and a low source height, and rule out truncation to greater than three gravitational radii at the 3 σ confidence level. In addition, we find that the line profile has not changed greatly in the switch from soft to hard states, and that the differences are consistent with changes in the underlying reflection spectrum rather than the relativistic blurring. We find that the blurring parameters are consistent when fitting either just the iron line <b>or</b> the entire <b>broad-band</b> spectrum, which is well modelled with a Comptonized continuum plus reflection model.
