2500|$|The fighter {{version of}} the VE-7 was {{designated}} VE-7S. It was a single-seater, the front cockpit being faired over and a [...] Vickers machine gun mounted over it {{on the left side}} and synchronized to fire through the propeller. Some planes, designated VE-7SF, had <b>floatation</b> <b>gear</b> consisting of inflatable bags stowed away, available to help keep the plane afloat when ditching at sea.|$|E
2500|$|The {{main cabin}} of the Super Puma, which is {{accessed}} via two sliding plug doors, used a reconfigurable floor arrangement, various passenger seating or cargo configurations can be adopted, including specialised configurations for medical operators. According to Airbus Helicopters, {{in addition to}} the two pilots, the short-fuselage AS332 can accommodate up to 15 passengers while the stretched-fuselage AS332 increases this to 20 passengers in a comfortable configuration. Soundproof upholstery is installed, as is separately-adjustable heating and ventilation systems. Along with the doors, 12 windows around the main cabin area are [...] for emergency exits. The lower fuselage can also be fitted with <b>floatation</b> <b>gear.</b> A hatch in the floor to access the cargo sling pole is present in the cabin, as is individual stowage space for airborne equipment.|$|E
50|$|Final Trainer version. Fitted with night flying {{equipment}} and <b>floatation</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|E
50|$|It {{featured}} a redesigned wing cellule with no stagger {{and an extra}} set of struts inboard, facilitating folding for stowage, a modified fuselage that carried emergency <b>floatation</b> <b>gear,</b> and main undercarriage that could be folded for stowage on the WB.IIIF. Later examples, designated WB.IIID could jettison their undercarriage for safer water landings.|$|E
50|$|Twelve of the Army Nieuports were {{transferred}} to the U.S. Navy which equipped them with Royal Navy style hydrovanes and wing <b>floatation</b> <b>gear,</b> and flew them from launching platforms mounted above the forward turrets of eight battleships, {{in the same way}} that Sopwith Camel 2F.1s were used by the British Grand Fleet.|$|E
5000|$|The fighter {{version of}} the VE-7 was {{designated}} VE-7S. It was a single-seater, the front cockpit being faired over and a [...]30 in Vickers machine gun mounted over it {{on the left side}} and synchronized to fire through the propeller. Some planes, designated VE-7SF, had <b>floatation</b> <b>gear</b> consisting of inflatable bags stowed away, available to help keep the plane afloat when ditching at sea.|$|E
50|$|The SR./A.1 was {{directly}} {{inspired by the}} (modest) successes experienced by the Imperial Japanese Navy with seaplane fighters such as the Nakajima A6M2-N (an adaptation of the Mitsubishi Zero) and the Kawanishi N1K. In theory, seaplanes were ideally suited to conditions in the Pacific theatre, and could turn any relatively calm area of coast into an airbase. Their main disadvantage came from {{the way in which}} the bulk of their <b>floatation</b> <b>gear</b> penalised their performance compared to other fighters.|$|E
50|$|After {{its return}} from France, the {{prototype}} B.1 (serial no. N.50), {{was sent to}} the RNAS Marine Experimental Depot at Port Victoria on the Isle of Grain for conversion to a two-seat reconnaissance aircraft, to be fitted with folding wings for operation from the Royal Navy's aircraft carriers. A cockpit for the observer replaced the bomb-bay of the B.1 behind the pilot's cockpit, while the wings were shortened to allow them to fold. A hydroplane was fitted ahead of the undercarriage and <b>floatation</b> <b>gear</b> added to allow safe ditching at sea. It retained the Hispano-Suiza 8 engine used by the bomber. When the modified aircraft was tested in November 1917, {{it was found that the}} changes had greatly reduced the aircraft's performance, while handling was also poor, with little aileron control.|$|E

50|$|The Cabri {{employs a}} {{side-by-side}} seating arrangement {{for a pilot}} and passenger, which is also ideal for training purposes, which is an intentional role for the type. Dual flight controls are typically installed, these can be removed {{without the aid of}} tools as required. The passenger seat can be removed if unnecessary or for greater storage space within the cabin. Various features for personal helicopter usage, such as an externally accessible 200-litre baggage compartment, power sockets within the main cabin, leather seating, and incidental under-seat storage, are also present. An unusual feature of the Cabri is a remote door locking system, which includes an immobilizer function; this has been reported as being a world-first. The Cabri is also the first light helicopter to feature a plasma ignition system, the first with a glass cockpit, and the first to be certified under TCDS 135 EASA regulations. Available options include air conditioning, various avionics configurations, moving map display, GPS system, cargo hook, automatically deployed <b>floatation</b> <b>gear,</b> and several maintenance tooling packages.|$|E
