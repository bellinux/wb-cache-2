Depending on the author, one or {{more from}} selenium, polonium, or astatine are sometimes added to the list. Boron sometimes <b>is</b> <b>excluded,</b> by itself, or with silicon. Sometimes tellurium is not regarded as a metalloid. The inclusion of antimony, polonium, and astatine as metalloids also has been questioned.|$|E

Gender differences were not considered a factor because treatment was performed in non-growing patients.|$|R
5|$|A simple model which predicts lyotropic phase {{transitions}} is the hard-rod model {{proposed by}} Lars Onsager. This theory considers the volume {{excluded from the}} center-of-mass of one idealized cylinder as it approaches another. Specifically, if the cylinders are oriented parallel to one another, {{there is very little}} volume that <b>is</b> <b>excluded</b> from the center-of-mass of the approaching cylinder (it can come quite close to the other cylinder). If, however, the cylinders are at some angle to one another, then there is a large volume surrounding the cylinder which the approaching cylinder's center-of-mass cannot enter (due to the hard-rod repulsion between the two idealized objects). Thus, this angular arrangement sees a decrease in the net positional entropy of the approaching cylinder (there are fewer states available to it).|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 20th century, a few Roman Catholics were appointed, but {{concerns}} about {{diversity of the}} Court were mainly in terms of geographic diversity, to represent all geographic regions of the country, as opposed to ethnic, religious, or gender diversity. The 20th century saw the first appointment of justices who were Jewish (Louis Brandeis, 1916), African-American (Thurgood Marshall, 1967), female (Sandra Day O'Connor, 1981), and Italian-American (Antonin Scalia, 1986). The 21st century saw the first appointment of a Hispanic justice (Sonia Sotomayor, 2009), if justice Benjamin Cardozo, who was a Sephardi Jew of Portuguese descent and appointed in 1932, <b>is</b> <b>excluded.</b>|$|E
5|$|The nuclear lamina is {{composed}} mostly of lamin proteins. Like all proteins, lamins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and later {{transported to the}} nucleus interior, where they are assembled before being incorporated into the existing network of nuclear lamina. Lamins found on the cytosolic face of the membrane, such as emerin and nesprin, bind to the cytoskeleton to provide structural support. Lamins are also found inside the nucleoplasm where they form another regular structure, known as the nucleoplasmic veil, that is visible using fluorescence microscopy. The actual function of the veil is not clear, although it <b>is</b> <b>excluded</b> from the nucleolus and is present during interphase. Lamin structures {{that make up the}} veil, such as LEM3, bind chromatin and disrupting their structure inhibits transcription of protein-coding genes.|$|E

5|$|Older gravestones in the {{cemetery}} are generally cut from limestone, and the gravestones placed after 1900 are predominantly made of polished granite. Most of the gravestones have weathered significantly. The gravestones are generally rounded or rectangular in shape, and are placed on small stone foundations. The gravestones of prominent local leaders are more ornate in character, including that of Captain David Pugh and his family, who are buried under a large obelisk that lists the names of his three wives and their respective children. Nixon's gravestone is deteriorating due to advanced weathering; it is made of limestone and contains a carving of an open book. Following {{the purchase of a}} rectangular land tract around 1990, {{the cemetery}} was expanded on the east side. This section of the cemetery <b>is</b> <b>excluded</b> from the church's historically-recognized boundaries, as it was not associated with the church during the period of its greatest significance.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} recognises {{that there}} are no viable alternative aviation fuels, and whilst it accepts that the exemption of aviation fuel from fuel tax is anomalous, it sees no scope for a unilateral approach in addressing this. The strategy adopted in the White Paper seeks to mitigate the global impact of air transport primarily through emissions trading schemes. Although the Kyoto Protocol implemented emissions trading as a means to reduce emissions at national levels, the global nature of air transport means that all air travel <b>is</b> <b>excluded</b> from this mechanism. The government is seeking to redress this through the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), which has been working on the environmental issue since 1998, but progress is slow. In the meantime efforts are being made to include aviation in the EU Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) with an original target to implement this by 2008. In 2006 the government re-affirmed this policy as the best approach for addressing the climate change impacts of aviation, and current proposals aim at accomplishing this for all flights within the EU by 2011, with the scheme being extended to include all flights to and from the EU the following year.|$|E

30|$|Fifteen {{patients}} <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> {{from the}} study for various reasons. Seven patients <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> because the device was not successfully placed in the ventricle of the brain. In these cases, there was no ICP waveform or reading associated with the ventricular catheter, therefore comparison to intraparenchymal ICP was not possible. Three patients <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> because of difficulty with insertion and suspected rupture of the parenchymal balloon. There was no intraparenchymal waveform or ICP reading, and comparison to ventricular ICP was not possible. Three patients <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> because of unavailability of the investigator for study enrollment or data collection. Two patients <b>were</b> <b>excluded</b> because of death within four hours of device insertion and inability of investigator to collect data. As a result, 35 patients were successfully enrolled.|$|R
