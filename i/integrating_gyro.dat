Some general design criteria are derived and applied to the specific example of the Orbiting Astronomical Observatory.

The steady-state and transient behavior of the system, as determined by the analysis, by the analog study, and by the experimental platform agreed quite well. The results of this study show that systems using <b>integrating</b> <b>gyros</b> for precise satellite attitude control can be designed to have a reasonably rapid and well-damped transient response, as well as very small steady-state errors. Furthermore, it is shown that the gyros act as rate sensors, as well as torque sources, so that no rate stabilization networks are required, and when no error sensor is available, the vehicle is still rate stabilized. Hence, it is shown that a major advantage of a gyro control system is that when the target is occulted, an alternate reference is not required...|$|R

In this paper, differential control algorithms are designed for a 2 -piece HRG. To design a precision controller, the electromechanical modelling and signal processing must be pre-performed accurately.

Electromechanical modeling of the resonator, electric module and charge amplifier is performed by considering the mode shape of a thin hemispherical shell. Further, signal processing and control algorithms are designed. The multi-flexing scheme of sensing, driving cycles and x, y-axis switching cycles is appropriate for high precision and low maneuverability systems. The differential control scheme is easily capable of rejecting the common mode errors of x, y-axis signals and changing the rate integrating mode on basis of these studies.

40|$|The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) {{spacecraft}} {{has been}} undergoing {{design for a}} controlled re-entry to Earth. During simulation of the re-entry plan, there was evidence of errors in the attitude determination algorithms during thruster modes. These errors affected the bum efficiency, and thus planning, during re-entry. During thruster modes, the spacecraft attitude is controlled off of <b>integrated</b> <b>Gyro</b> Error Angles that were designed to closely follow the nominal spacecraft pointing frame (Tip Frame). These angles, however, were not exactly mapped to the Tip Frame from the Body Frame. Additionally, in the initial formulation of the thruster mode attitude determination algorithms, several assumptions and approximations were made to conserve processor speed. These errors became noticeable and significant when simulating bums of much longer duration (- 10 times) than had been produced in flight. A solution is proposed that uses attitude determination information from a propagated extended Kalman filter that already exists in the TRMM thruster modes. This attitude information is then used to rotate the Gyro Error Angles into the Tip Frame. An error analysis is presented that compares the two formulations. The new algorithm is tested using the TRMM High-Fidelity Simulator and verified with the TRMM Software Testing and Training Facility.

40|$|The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) {{hardware}} complement includes six gas bearing, pulse rebalanced rate <b>integrating</b> <b>gyros,</b> any {{three of}} which are sufficient to conduct the science mission. After the loss of three gyros between April 1997 and April 1999 due to a known corrosion mechanism, NASA decided to split the third HST servicing mission into SM 3 A, accelerated to October 1999, and SM 3 B, scheduled for November 2001. SM 3 A was developed as a quick turnaround 'Launch on Need' mission to replace all six gyros. Loss of a fourth gyro in November 1999 caused HST to enter Zero Gyro Sunpoint (ZGSP) safemode, which uses sun sensors and magnetometers for attitude determination and momentum bias to maintain attitude stability during orbit night. Several instances of large attitude excursions during orbit night were observed, but ZGSP performance was adequate to provide power-positive sun pointing and to support low gain antenna communications. Body rates in ZGSP were estimated to exceed the nominal 0. 1 deg/sec rendezvous limit, so rendezvous operations were restructured to utilize coarse, limited life, Retrieval Mode Gyros (RMGs) under Hardware Sunpoint (HWSP) safemode. Contingency procedures were developed to conduct the rendezvous in ZGSP {{in the event of}} RMGA or HWSP computer failure. Space Shuttle Mission STS- 103 launched on December 19, 1999 after a series of weather and Shuttle-related delays.

40|$|A {{magnetometer}} {{is often}} used to aid heading estimation of a low-cost Inertial Pedestrian Navigation System (IPNS) without which the latter {{will not be able to}} accurately estimate heading for more than a few seconds, even with the help of Zero Velocity Update (ZVU). Heading measurements from the magnetometer are typically <b>integrated</b> with <b>gyro</b> heading in an estimation filter such as Kalman Filter (KF) — to best estimate the true IPNS heading, resulting in a better positioning accuracy. However indoors the reliability of these measurements is often questionable because of the magnetic disturbances that can disrupt the measurements. To solve this problem, a filtering method {{is often used}} to select the best measurements. However, the importance of the frequency of these measurement updates has not been highlighted. In this paper, the impact of frequency of magnetometer updates on the overall accuracy of the navigation system is presented. The paper starts by discussing the use of a magnetometer in a low-cost IPNS. An exemplary filter to extract reliable heading measurements from the magnetometer is then described. From real field trial results, it will be shown that even if reliable heading measurements may be obtained indoors, it is still insufficient to increase the positioning accuracy of the low-cost IPNS unless it is reliable on every epoch...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{attitude}} estimation approach {{relying on a}} particle filter is proposed for an autonomous attitude sensor which <b>integrates</b> rate <b>gyros</b> with a star sensor. Thanks to the complementary characteristics of modern inertial and star sensors, with the former being able of performing measurements at high data rates with precision decreasing over time, and the latter being able of high-precision measurements at lower updating frequency, the integrated sensor can provide complete operational autonomy during all the mission phases. Particle filters are Sequential Monte Carlo methods relying on a point-mass representation of probability density distributions, which allows generalizing traditional Kalman filtering approaches. Specifically, for inherently non-linear estimation problems, the particle filter allows overcoming the well-known limitations of the Kalman Filtering approaches, leading also to faster convergence from inaccurate initial conditions. The adopted filter formulation incorporates standard gyro-based model, for attitude propagation, and star sensor measurement model, for measurement update. The attitude parameterization is given in terms of Euler’s angles. The filter algorithm is implemented into a numerical model of the spacecraft orbital and attitude dynamics. Filter performance is numerically tested considering different dynamics conditions, and initial estimation errors. Simulation results show {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed filtering scheme in comparison with a standard Kalman Filter approach.

40|$|Over {{the last}} 20 years, {{navigation}} has almost {{become synonymous with}} satellite positioning, e. g. the Global Positioning System (GPS). On land, sea or in the air, on the road or in a city, knowing ones position {{is a question of}} getting a clear line of sight to enough satellites. Unfortunately, since the signals are extremely weak there are environments the GPS signals cannot reach but where positioning is still highly sought after, such as indoors and underwater. Also, because the signals are so weak, GPS is vulnerable to jamming. This thesis is about alternative means of positioning for three scenarios where gps cannot be used. Indoors, there is a desire to accurately position first responders, police officers and soldiers. This could make their work both safer and more efficient. In this thesis an inertial navigation system using a foot mounted inertial magnetic mea- surement unit is studied. For such systems, zero velocity updates can be used to significantly reduce the drift in distance travelled. Unfortunately, the estimated direction one is moving in is also subject to drift, causing large positioning errors. We have therefore chosen to throughly study the key problem of robustly estimating heading indoors. To measure heading, magnetic field measurements {{can be used as a}} compass. Unfortunately, they are often disturbed indoors making them unreliable. For estimation support, the turn rate of the sensor can be measured by a gyro but such sensors often have bias problems. In this work, we present two different approaches to estimate heading despite these shortcomings. Our first system uses a Kalman filter bank that recursively estimates if the magnetic readings are disturbed or undisturbed. Our second approach estimates the entire history of headings at once, by matching <b>integrated</b> <b>gyro</b> measurements to a vector of magnetic heading measurements. Large scale experiments are used to evaluate both methods. When the heading estimation is incorporated into our positioning system, experiments show that positioning errors are reduced significantly. We also present a probabilistic stand still detection framework based on accelerometer and gyro measurements. The second and third problems studied are both maritime. Naval navigation systems are today heavily dependent on GPS. Since GPS is easily jammed, the vessels are vulnerable in critical situations. In this work we describe a radar based backup positioning system to be used in case of GPS failure. radar scans are matched using visual features to detect how the surroundings have changed, thereby describing how the vessel has moved. Finally, we study the problem of underwater positioning, an environment gps signals cannot reach. A sensor network can track vessels using acoustics and the magnetic disturbances they induce. But in order to do so, the sensors themselves first have to be accurately positioned. We present a system that positions the sensors using a friendly vessel with a known magnetic signature and trajectory. Simulations show that by studying the magnetic disturbances that the vessel produces, the location of each sensor can be accurately estimated...|$|R
40|$|To {{provide a}} long-time {{reliable}} orientation, sensor fusion technologies {{are widely used}} to integrate available inertial sensors for the low-cost orientation estimation. In this paper, a novel dual-linear Kalman filter was designed for a multi-sensor system <b>integrating</b> MEMS <b>gyros,</b> an accelerometer, and a magnetometer. The proposed filter precludes the impacts of magnetic disturbances on the pitch and roll which the heading is subjected to. The filter can achieve robust orientation estimation for different statistical models of the sensors. The root mean square errors (RMSE) of the estimated attitude angles are reduced by 30. 6 % under magnetic disturbances. Owing to the reduction of system complexity achieved by smaller matrix operations, the mean total time consumption is reduced by 23. 8 %. Meanwhile, the separated filter offers greater flexibility for the system configuration, as {{it is possible to}} switch on or off the second stage filter to include or exclude the magnetometer compensation for the heading. Online experiments were performed on the homemade miniature orientation determination system (MODS) with the turntable. The average RMSE of estimated orientation are less than 0. 4 ° and 1 ° during the static and low-dynamic tests, respectively. More realistic tests on two-wheel self-balancing vehicle driving and indoor pedestrian walking were carried out to evaluate the performance of the designed MODS when high accelerations and angular rates were introduced. Test results demonstrate that the MODS is applicable for the orientation estimation under various dynamic conditions.

Micromechanical devices and systems are inherently smaller, lighter, and faster than their macroscopic counterparts, and are usually more precise.

However these gyros tend to be large and heavy, and they consume large quantities of power.

MEMS gyro {{development has been}} based primarily on the properties of moving mass to sense rotation and has failed {{to keep pace with}} the concurrent development of MEMS accelerometers because the reduction of size and therefore mass is substantially more detrimental to the performance of gyros than to accelerometers. A small ({approx} 0. 2 cu in), robust ({approx} 20, 000 g), inexpensive ({approx}$ 500), tactical grade performance ({approx} 10 - 20 deg/hr.) gyro is vital for the successful implementation of the next generation of ''smart'' weapons and surveillance apparatus. The range of applications (relevant to Sandia's mission) that are substantially enhanced in capability or enabled by the availability of a gyro possessing the above attributes includes nuclear weapon guidance, fuzing, and safing; synthetic aperture radar (SAR) motion compensation; autonomous air and ground vehicles; gun-launched munitions; satellite control; and personnel tracking. For example, a gyro of this capability would open for consideration more fuzing options for earth-penetration weapons. The MEMS gyros currently available are lacking in one or more of the aforementioned attributes. An <b>integrated</b> optical <b>gyro,</b> however, possesses the potential of achieving all desired attributes. Optical gyros use the properties of light to sense rotation and require no moving mass.

This new revolutionary device utilizes a dual arc accelerometer array and an algorithm for accurate and reliable two-dimensional attitude determination and rate gyro bias estimation in real-time. The method determines the local gravitational field vector from which attitude information can be resolved. Upon determining the location of the local gravitational field vector relative to two consecutive accelerometer sensors, the orientation of the device may then be estimated and the attitude determined. However, this measurement is discrete in nature; therefore, <b>integrated</b> rate <b>gyro</b> measurements are used to determine attitude information resulting in a continuous signal. However, attitude estimates and measurements produced by instantaneous rate sensors and gyroscope integration tend to drift over time due to drift and bias inherent to the rate gyro sensor. The integration of the acquired instantaneous rate signals amplify measurement errors leading to an undependable and imprecise estimate of the vehicles true attitude and orientation. A method for compensation of these errors is proposed in this work resulting in a highly accurate and continuous attitude estimate. For this thesis, simulations of the proposed method and device will be conducted with the inclusion of characteristic, real-world sensor noise and bias estimates produced from corrupted and biased sensors to analyze and assess the feasibility and validity of the proposed method and system configuration for two-dimensional attitude determination. The end goal of this work is to produce a precise and reliable longitudinal and transverse attitude estimation array capable of measuring rate senor and gyro bias online so as to produce highly accurate and reliable pitch and roll angle tracking in real-time while under subjection to simulated flight conditions and scenarios. While this thesis is an expansion of a previously developed device and method, it is a departure from past works in that a new, two-dimensional accelerometer array arc is utilized and additional rotational dimensions are being included in the simulated analysis...|$|R
40|$|This project {{initiated}} {{the development of}} TGYRO ? a steady-state Gyrokinetic transport code (SSGKT) that <b>integrates</b> micro-scale <b>GYRO</b> turbulence simulations into a framework for practical multi-scale simulation of conventional tokamaks as well as future reactors. Using a lightweight master transport code, multiple independent (each massively parallel) gyrokinetic simulations are coordinated. The capability to evolve profiles using the TGLF model was also added to TGYRO and represents a more typical use-case for TGYRO. The goal {{of the project was}} to develop a steady-state Gyrokinetic transport code (SSGKT) that integrates micro-scale gyrokinetic turbulence simulations into a framework for practical multi-scale simulation of a burning plasma core ? the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) in particular. This multi-scale simulation capability will be used to predict the performance (the fusion energy gain, Q) given the H-mode pedestal temperature and density. At present, projections of this type rely on transport models like GLF 23, which are based on rather approximate fits to the results of linear and nonlinear simulations. Our goal is to make these performance projections with precise nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations. The method of approach is to use a lightweight master transport code to coordinate multiple independent (each massively parallel) gyrokinetic simulations using the GYRO code. This project targets the practical multi-scale simulation of a reactor core plasma in order to predict the core temperature and density profiles given the H-mode pedestal temperature and density. A master transport code will provide feedback to O(16) independent gyrokinetic simulations (each massively parallel). A successful feedback scheme offers a novel approach to predictive modeling of an important national and international problem. Success in this area of fusion simulations will allow US scientists to direct the research path of ITER over the next two decades. The design of an efficient feedback algorithm is a serious numerical challenge. Although the power source and transport balance coding in the master are standard, it is nontrivial to design a feedback loop that can cope with outputs that are both intermittent and extremely expensive. A prototypical feedback scheme has already been successfully demonstrated for a single global GYRO simulation, although the robustness and efficiency are likely far from optimal. Once the transport feedback scheme is perfected, it could, in principle, be embedded into any of the more elaborate transport codes (ONETWO, TRANSP, and CORSICA), or adopted by other FSP-related multi-scale projects...|$|R
40|$|The team {{is divided}} into four main {{technical}} areas; aircraft systems, airborne platform, target acquisition and ground station The UAV aircraft system <b>integrates</b> GPS, accelerometers, <b>gyros,</b> pitot tubes (static/dynamic) and an ultrasonic for accurate above ground estimation for landing. It is hoped to be able remove the GPS and integrate in DGPS from GPSatSys for a more accurate solution, the mission strategy relies on an accurate delivery {{to give us the}} edge in this competition. This however, is seemingly extremely unlikey for the 2007 entrant. For image processing, a human-in-the-loop is aimed at for a baseline. The next phase is to try to identify the human (processing on the ground) in both IR and EO spectrums. The viability of an IR solution in daylight is currently being tested. The final Phase, but this may not be ready for 2007, is to statistically fuse these two filtered images and have completely automated identification. There are three communication links in the SRUAV system. The command and control link will be implemented using a 900 MHz FHSS 9. 2 kbps radio modems (MicroHardCorp). Additionally, a 2. 4 GHz transmission of PAL video is the baseline for the secondary link. A tracking antenna will track this link with the UAVs position being fed in via RS- 232 from the Ground Station. The platform in which testing of the system was conducted was essentially a trainer-style model aeroplane called a Big Lift and dubbed “Emigo”. Modifications were made, doubling the engine size, to attain speeds considered necessary to complete this mission with some contingency time (around 180 km/hr). Once designed and tested these systems were implemented on a more efficient structure based around the Burt Rutan Long-EZ. This is a 2. 4 m wingspan aeromodel, a pusher prop canard wing. The structure has been reinforced, and a more powerful engine is used (50 cc). We will also add various modifications to the fuselage, etc for housing electronics...|$|R
40|$|The {{nonlinear}} interaction (NLI) between modes in a {{semiconductor laser}} or amplifier {{is one of}} the techniques to obtain slow light (ng >> 1), fast light (- 1 < ng < 1), phase conjugated reflection (also known as backward light (ng < 0)) and supercontinuum emission (also known as critically anomalous dispersion (ng = 0)), where ng is the group index. In the nonlinear interaction (NLI) mechanism, the interaction between a driving wave (mode) which is of sufficiently high intensity, and a probe wave (mode) results in modification of complex permittivity of the probe wave, if the frequency detuning between the two waves falls into the spectral range of parametric interaction. Consequently, in the vicinity of a strong driving wave (mode), the optical parameters such as the phase index, group index, linewidth, and the gain of a neighboring probe (weak) wave are strongly perturbed. The unusual perturbation of group index leads to slow light, fast light and backward propagating light depending on the frequency detuning between the two waves. Fast light can have important applications in interferometry, to make very sensitive interferometric sensors for detection of nano displacement, ultra-low vibration, rotation rate and even very weak gravitational waves. The slope sensitivity of an active <b>integrated</b> ring laser <b>gyro</b> (RLG) is directly proportional {{to the size of the}} ring and inversely proportional to the group index of the medium filling the cavity. By reducing ng in the nonlinear regime of laser operation, slope sensitivity can be improved by manifolds without having to increase the size of the gyro, which will lead to monolithic integration. In this dissertation work, the numerical modeling and simulation of NLI in semiconductor ridge waveguide (RWG) lasers is performed and perturbations of phase index, group index, gain, linewidth are calculated. The modeling is based on “theory of nonlinear interaction of waves” developed for plane waves and is applied to RWG lasers. The RWG laser structures are based on GaN/InGaN, GaAs/AlGaAs, InGaAs/GaAs/AlGaAs, InGaAsP/InP material systems, to cover the most important spectral range of semiconductor lasers starting from λ = 0. 4 µm to λ = 1. 55 µm, respectively. The photonic design software RSoft’s FemSIM that uses finite element method is used for design and modeling of NLI in RWG and calculation of effective phase index. The induced dispersion and effective group index ng are then calculated by differentiation of the effective phase index of guided probe wave over the optical frequency. The calculations indicate that the magnitude of NLI depends on the driving wave intensity, frequency detuning between driving and probe waves, lifetime of carriers in the laser system, optical confinement factor, driving wave wavelength and linewidth broadening factor of the laser structure. 	An important result of this work is observation of frequency points where ng passes zero line, known as the points of critically anomalous dispersion (CAD). In the spectral vicinity of CAD points, superluminal group velocity is observed, which can be used for improving the sensitivity of ring laser gyros and other interferometric sensors. In this dissertation, we established possibility of superluminal behavior (- 1 < ng < 1) through NLI in all of the above mentioned RWG laser structures, and obtained the conditions necessary to observe this behavior. Also, the CAD frequencies are plotted by varying the driving wave intensities, where the data form a closed loop. The closing of the loop is due to suppression of NLI with an increase in driving wave intensity; at high intensities, the stimulated recombination rate increases, leading to an increase in overall relaxation rate, which in turn decreases the NLI. The CAD loops are calculated for all the RWG lasers mentioned above. The CAD loops provide information on lower and upper threshold intensity of the driving wave, and on frequency detuning between the driving and probe waves for observation of superluminal group velocity. Another important result is that the perturbed linewidth increases infinitely at the CAD point, leading to supercontinuum emission or white light, which can be exploited for very broadband laser emission applications. We also fitted our numerically calculated perturbed delay and advance due to NLI with the experimental data of perturbed delay and advance of an optical pulse in a semiconductor optical amplifier based on InGaAsP/InP, and identified the CAD point for the very first time.
