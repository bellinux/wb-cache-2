2500|$|The {{construction}} of the C 37/40 was ahead of it's time. Utilizing aircraft grade pre-impregnated balsa core material and Kevlar / fibreglass fabric, the hull and deck are laid up using vinyl ester resin for strength, blister resistance and light weight. The C 37 Plus series are built up with isophthalic (Hydrex®) <b>gelcoat,</b> C's exclusive Kevlar hybrid, E-Glass, pre-impregnated end-grain Baltek AL-600 balsa ( [...] balsa core in hull and [...] in deck) and Hydrex® resin. Hydrex®, a modified isophthalic [...] vinyl ester resin, has higher hydrolytic stability, toughness and is more crack resistant than conventional resins. The layups of the R and XL series use Kevlar hybrid exclusively with Hydrex® resin {{on both sides of}} a core of Balteck AL-600 aircraft grade balsa. All materials are Lloyd's approved. These exclusive C laminate schedules result in hulls and decks which despite significant weight reduction are stronger than the conventional glass laminates of the time. They are not only much lighter, but stiffer and more rigid. Additional unidirectional glass is used in highly stressed areas with aluminum and coremat hardware backing. The boot stripe is molded in the hull for fairness to the hull surface and to reduce maintenance requirements.|$|E
50|$|Once {{the plug}} has its release agent applied, <b>gelcoat</b> is applied with a roller, brush or specially-designed spray gun. The <b>gelcoat</b> is {{pigmented}} resin, {{and gives the}} mold surface a harder, more durable finish.|$|E
50|$|As these {{boats are}} now ageing somewhat, the {{original}} <b>gelcoat</b> may have faded or gone chalky if {{the boat was}} not kept under cover. It would not be unusual in a boat of this age for hulls to have been renovated by painting the original <b>gelcoat.</b>|$|E
50|$|Suitable resin {{chemistries}} for {{the manufacture}} of <b>gelcoats</b> vary, but the most commonly encountered are unsaturated polyesters or epoxies. Within each of these categories, the resin chemistries are further subdivided.|$|R
50|$|Think of {{protecting}} your fiberglass investments from UV, {{much the same}} way you would protect your children with sun screen; <b>gelcoats</b> are sunscreens for your tanks, vessels and other fiberglass constructs.|$|R
5000|$|Specialized <b>gelcoats</b> {{can be used}} to {{manufacture}} the moulds which in turn are used {{to manufacture}} components. These require very high levels of durability to overcome the mechanical and thermal stresses encountered during the curing and demoulding processes.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to any pigment a <b>gelcoat</b> will, if necessary, contain a thixotropic additive to assist its tenacity to vertical {{portions of the}} mould whilst it cures.|$|E

50|$|The {{manufactured}} component, when sufficiently cured {{and removed}} from the mold, presents the <b>gelcoated</b> surface. This is usually pigmented to provide a coloured, glossy surface which improves the aesthetic appearance of the article, such as a counter made with cultured marble.|$|R
50|$|The hull is of {{hand-laid}} {{glass fibre}} construction using isophthalic resin {{for the initial}} layer, giving protection against osmosis. A choice of coloured <b>gelcoats</b> is offered. The stiffeners are constructed using a foam core and extra strength {{is provided by the}} use of woven rovings and balsa core material. The superstructure uses the same hand-laid technique and incorporates PVC foam and balsa for strength. Epoxy coating to the hull is used below the waterline. Teak decks standard.|$|R

5000|$|Once {{the release}} agent and <b>gelcoat</b> are applied, layers of {{fiberglass}} and resin are laid-up onto the surface. The fiberglass used will typically be {{identical to that}} which {{will be used in}} the final product.|$|E
30|$|The {{hydrophobic}} nanodispersed silicas {{are widely}} used as fillers for adhesives and sealants, epoxy resins, vinylester resins, <b>gelcoats,</b> cable gels, and natural and artificial oils and grease, as well as component of biological dispersions and sorbents. The most promising among the above materials are polyorganosiloxane-modified pyrogenic silicas which are characterized by thermal stability, chemical inertness, and hydrophobic properties [1 – 3]. These properties are determined by a type of organosilicon polymer/silica interaction, a thickness and architecture of the grafted surface layer.|$|R

5000|$|Many marine {{craft and}} {{aircraft}} are manufactured using composite materials with an outer layer of <b>gelcoat,</b> typically 0.5 mm to 0.8 mm (0.02 in to 0.03 in) thick. Gelcoats {{are designed to}} be durable, providing resistance to ultraviolet degradation and hydrolysis.|$|E
5000|$|Fiberglass {{vessels and}} {{constructs}} are also susceptible to degradation upon long-term exposure to sunlight. This deterioration is {{brought about by}} chemical changes which occur {{as a result of}} exposure to the ultraviolet (UV) portion of light. Degradation results in the fiberglass tanks and constructs, opening pores in the surface allowing styrene to wick out of the vessel or construct's walls, causing them to become embrittled, reducing the impact resistance and potential elongation properties of the part. Degradation from UV light can be effectively inhibited by the addition of exterior <b>gelcoats</b> and sealants, which protect the fiberglass construct through removing UV access to the product's surface thus deflecting UV energy.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the use of}} in situ and laboratory techniques for monitoring of trace metals and master variables in the environment. Chapter 1 presents a general overview of trace metals, their sources, sinks and roles in estuaries and near coastal zones, their general characteristics {{and the importance of}} their behaviour in estuaries. Filtration and commonly used analytical methods for trace metals detemriinations in natural waters are also discussed. Chapter 2 highlights the importance of colloids (in the size range 0. 2 to 0. 4) to membrane clogging and concludes that cojloids account for a significant part of clogging of membrane filters. The aim {{of this study was to}} extend earlier studies by examining the trends of filtrate concentrations as a function of filtration volume in riverine and estuarine waters with contrasting matrix composition, over two different seasons. Based on the findings presented in this chapter some metal specific filtration protocols are suggested. Chapter 3 provides an overview of developments in instrument automation that have led to miniaturisation and resulting in manufacture of portable electrochemical instrumentation. Such instrumentation has been used for continuous trace metal measurements from the banks of estuaries and on-board ships. The most recent developments in flow-through cells with a <b>gelcoated</b> Iridium (Ir) micro-electrode array have resulted in submersible in s/Yu voltammetric probes which allow long-term trace metal measurements at sub-nanomolar concentrations in coastal waters. Such In situ probes hold great promise for water quality monitoring. Chapter 4 presents the optimisation and validation of a Voltammetric In situ Profiling (VIP) system for the simultaneous determinations of Cd(ll), Cu(ll) and Pb(ll) in estuarine and coastal waters. The trace metal faction measured by the VIP system is termed 'dynamic' and includes and includes these free ions and small complexes with size smaller than a few nm. Systematic studies in NaNOa and seawater were conducted and these showed that variations in ionic strength, pH and dissolved oxygen did not affect the response of the instrument, whereas an Arrhenius type temperature response was observed. During the work, physical and voltammetric settings of the VIP system were considered and tested in detail in order to achieve the analytical requirements to perform measurements in the laboratory and during in situ deployments^ The VIP instrument has a detection limit (defined as 3 cj) in seawater for Cd(II) of 23 pM, Cu(ll) 1. 13 nM, and Pb(ll) 23 pM. The accuracy of the VIP system was determined with certified reference material (CRM), showing good agreement. Chapter 5 discusses the results of an international laboratory inter-comparison exercise, in order to verify precision and accuracy of measurements made by 4 laboratories that operate VIP systems located in Plymouth, U. K; Geneva, Switzeriand and Ancona, Italy, using laboratory reference methods as a comparison. Inter-comparison included analysis of Tamar Estuary samples and in situ VIP system measurements in the coastal waters of the Gullmar Fjord, Sweden. Chapter 6 presents the results of field deployment of the automated Voltammetric In situ Profiling (VIP) system for the simultaneous determinations of dynamic Cd(ll), Cu(ll) and Pb(ll) in three estuaries located in the Southwest of England, UK. The VIP instrument allowed the In situ determination of 2 - 4 samples h' In addition, the VIP system measured total filterable (0. 4 pm pore size filter) concentrations of Gd(ll) and Pb(ll) in discrete estuarine water samples. Through a series of tidal surveys lasting 7 - 12 h each and totalling 7 surveys a high resolution data set including speciation information was built up that enabled an interpretation of geochemical processes in the studied estuaries. Chapter 7 shows the results of In situ determination of VIP dynamic metal concentrations in the Po plume arid Adriatic Sea. Concentrations were similar to those previously reported for this coastal sea system. The correlation of the metals with salinity was presented and highlighted the importance of local effluent inputs close to the river mouth for Cd(ll). The data demonstrated that the Adriatic was not heavily contaminated with trace metals. Chapter 8 presents the overall conclusions from the research and makes suggestions for future work.

50|$|The {{processing}} {{steps are}} very similar to those in hand lay-up. In this process, the release agent is first applied to the mould and then a layer of <b>gelcoat</b> is applied. The <b>gelcoat</b> is left for two hours, until it hardens. Once the <b>gelcoat</b> hardens, a spray gun is used to deposit the fibre resin mixture onto the surface of the mould. The spray gun chops the incoming continuous rovings (one or more rovings) to a predetermined length and impels it through the resin/catalyst mixture. Resin/catalyst mixing can take place inside the gun (gun mixing) or {{just in front of the}} gun. Gun mixing provides thorough mixing of resin and catalyst inside the gun and is preferred to minimize the health hazard concerns of the operator. In the other type, the catalyst is sprayed through two side nozzles into the resin envelope. Airless spray guns are becoming popular because they provide more controlled spray patterns and reduced emission of volatiles. In an airless system, hydraulic pressure is used to dispense the resin through special nozzles that break up the resin stream into small droplets which then become saturated with the reinforcements. In an air-atomized spray gun system, pressurized air is used to dispense the resin.|$|E
50|$|As in the mold-making process, {{release agent}} is first {{applied to the}} mold. Colored <b>gelcoat</b> is then applied. Layers of {{fiberglass}} are then applied, using the same procedure as before. Once completed and cured, the component is separated from the mold using wedges, compressed air or both.|$|E
5000|$|Normal <b>gelcoat</b> {{formulated}} for {{use with}} polyester resins and vinylester resins does not adhere to epoxy surfaces, though epoxy adheres very well if applied to polyester resin surfaces.

50|$|The artwork is in {{the form}} of an organic, rounded pod {{structure}} that is approximately 20’ in length and has a domed roof. The structure is made from expanded polystyrene foam, which is then coated with a fiberglass-resin matrix and a white <b>Gelcoat</b> mixture. After the <b>Gelcoat</b> cures, it functions as a protective shell for the initial foam layers as well as the interior living space. The artwork is complete with a wooden door, mounted with its own knob and lock hardware.

50|$|A major {{appeal of}} solid surface is its impermeability. Engineered {{composites}} have a <b>gelcoat</b> surface finish {{which makes them}} impervious to bacteria, staining {{and most of the}} problems inherent in natural stone. Solid surface sinks can be joined to the countertop surface with no gaps, which eliminates areas for water to collect and bacteria to grow.
