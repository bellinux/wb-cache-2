50|$|Convergent nozzles {{are used}} on many jet engines. If the nozzle {{pressure}} ratio {{is above the}} critical value (about 1.8:1) a convergent nozzle will choke, resulting {{in some of the}} expansion to atmospheric pressure taking place downstream of the throat (i.e. smallest flow area), in the jet wake.

50|$|The above {{equation}} {{applies only}} for air-breathing jet engines. It {{does not apply}} to rocket engines. Most types of jet engine have an air intake, which provides the bulk of the fluid exiting the exhaust. Conventional rocket engines, however, do not have an intake, the oxidizer and fuel both being carried within the vehicle. Therefore, rocket engines do not have ram drag and the <b>gross</b> <b>thrust</b> of the rocket engine nozzle is the net thrust of the engine. Consequently, the thrust characteristics of a rocket motor are different from that of an air breathing jet engine, and thrust is independent of velocity.|$|E
50|$|Initially as the {{aircraft}} gains speed down the runway, {{there will be}} little increase in nozzle pressure and temperature, because the ram rise in the intake is very small. There will also be little change in mass flow. Consequently, nozzle <b>gross</b> <b>thrust</b> initially only increases marginally with flight speed. However, being an air breathing engine (unlike a conventional rocket) there is a penalty for taking on-board air from the atmosphere. This is known as ram drag. Although the penalty is zero at static conditions, it rapidly increases with flight speed causing the net thrust to be eroded.|$|E

40|$|Summary. The {{performance}} of a turbo-jet engine has been measured, and alternative methods of determining <b>gross</b> <b>thrust</b> and air mass flow calibrated in a ground level static test bed and an altitude test bed simulating flight conditions. The agreement between the two test beds is very good. It is shown that if {{it is necessary to}} extrapolate calibrations to flight conditions, this may be made most accurately in terms of 'effective areas'. The preferred method of measuring <b>gross</b> <b>thrust</b> in flight is that based on the final nozzle static pressure measurements. The measurements of air mass flow required to convert <b>gross</b> <b>thrust</b> to net thrust are subject to quite large random errors, but the method based on the measurements from the transition section between the turbine and jet pipe is easiest to apply, and {{it should be possible to}} improve its accuracy. Using these methods, random errors of the order __ _ 4 per cent for net thrust determination can be expected. Comparison of 'non-dimensional ' performance measured in flight, and in the test beds, was good for non-reheat conditions, but significant differences were noted for the reheat results. It is believed that these differences were due to the effects of the intake on the reheat fuel control unit in flight. The accurac...|$|E

40|$|A single {{expansion}} ramp nozzle highly {{integrated into}} a hypersonic vehicle's afterbody airframe is capable of meeting thrust requirements for hypersonic cruise velocities. In the transonic flight Mach number regime, however, nozzle expansion ratios are too large, and unfavorable, downward-directed <b>gross</b> <b>thrust</b> vectors are produced. Strong nose-up pitching moments jeopardize the trimming and stability of the vehicle. Injection of secondary gas into the nozzle flow can considerably improve the off-design performance of a hypersonic vehicle's nonmatched nozzle at transonic flight Mach numbers. For a rectangular convergent-divergent nozzle configuration with a single expansion ramp, 2 D Euler calculations of the complete afterbody/nozzle flow field were carried out for a flight Mach number of 1. 2. Flow fields with and without injection of the vehicle's forebody boundary layer into the nozzle flow were investigated and analyzed.

The model had a 35 deg swept wing of aspect ratio 7. 82 and two side-by-side engines mounted on a single pylon under each wing close to the fuselage. The lift of the flap system was augmented by jet engine exhaust impingement on the triple-slotted flap surfaces. The rearmost flap provided direct lift control.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of experiments on a device for producing thrust for underwater propulsion. The principle of the device is based on accelerating a large mass of water by expansion of a small mass of gas, the gas being injected continuously into the water. The investigation consisted of tests conducted on ducts of several different designs; varying the exit area of the duets, the water and gas flow, and the method of injecting and mixing the gas and water. Using hydrogen gas at a rate of 0. 0165 lbs/sec at a water flow rate of 27. 4 lbs/sec, a maximum <b>gross</b> <b>thrust</b> of 29. 2 lbs was obtained.
