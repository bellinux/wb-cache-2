50|$|Short mat bowls is {{very similar}} to lawn bowls in that the object is for each player, or team, to take turns rolling bowls (balls) down a mat in an attempt to get as many of the bowls as {{possible}} closer to the target (the 'jack') than the opponent. The main difference is {{in the size of the}} playing area and the presence of the block midway down the rink mat. The presence of the block prevents players from knocking their opponents' bowls away from the jack by sheer force; players are required to use the natural bias of the bowls to maneuver around the block. Any bowls that touch the block, or land in the ditch or <b>dead</b> <b>area,</b> are dead and are removed before the next bowl. The skill in playing short mat bowls comes from the bias of the ball and the inconsistent playing surface; both the performance of the rink mat and the floor surface can vary between matches in different venues. A general description of different bowls games, including short mat bowls, is maintained at bowls.org.uk.|$|E
5000|$|Skeletal Eroding Band, {{the most}} common disease of corals in the Indian and Pacific Oceans and {{also found in the}} Red Sea, is the first {{recorded}} disease of corals that is caused by a protozoan, and the first caused by a eukaryote - most are caused by bacteria. The disease is visible as a black band that slowly advances over corals, leaving dead coral in its wake. It is spread by cell division of Halofolliculina corallasia, which produces a pair of worm-like larvae that settle on undamaged coral just ahead of the black band. There each secretes its lorica, at the same spinning to produce the lorica's flask-like shape. This spinning, combined with the chemicals that harden the lorica, crumble the coral skeleton and kill the polyps.

40|$|Abstract Four {{independent}} {{distributions of}} seismicity in the <b>Dead</b> Sea <b>area</b> underline {{the occurrence of}} lower-crustal seismic activity down-to at least 27 km and possibly as deep as 33. 6 km. From these distributions, the seismogenic thickness {{is estimated to be}} 28. 4 ± 2. 2 km. The existence of a seismogenic zone extending deep into the lower crust is consistent with an average heat flow of only 40 – 45 mWm− 2 over most regions of Israel, and around 40 mWm− 2 in the <b>Dead</b> Sea <b>area</b> in particular. The seismogenic thickness in the <b>Dead</b> Sea <b>area</b> is thus nearly twice the average seismo-genic thickness of 15 km observed in southern California. The fact that some seismic activity occurs down-to the Moho in the <b>Dead</b> Sea <b>area</b> suggests that the state of fully plastic deformation is probably not reached in the crust under the seismogenic zone.

40|$|Laser {{structuring}} {{of different}} types of thin film layers is a state of the art process in the photovoltaic industry. TCO layers and molybdenum are structured with e. g. 1064 nm lasers. Amorphous silicon, microcrystalline silicon or cadmium telluride are ablated with 515 / 532 nm lasers. Typical pulse durations of the lasers in use for these material ablation processes are in the nanosecond range. Up to now the common process for CIS/CIGS cells is needle structuring. Hard metal needles scribe lines with a width of 30 to 60 m into the semiconductor material. A laser technology would have some advantages compared to mechanical scribing. The precision of the lines would be higher (no chipping effects), the laser has no wear out. The <b>dead</b> <b>area</b> (distance from P 1 structuring line to P 3 structuring line) can be significantly smaller with the laser technology. So we investigate the structuring of CIS/CIGS materials with ultra short pulse lasers of different wavelengths. The ablatio n rates and the structuring speeds versus the repetition rates have been established. For the different layer thicknesses and line widths we determined the necessary energy densities. After all tests we can calculate the possible reduction of the <b>dead</b> <b>area</b> on the thin film module. The new technology will result in an increase in the efficiency per module of up to 4 %...|$|E
