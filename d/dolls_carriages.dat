5000|$|Mora {{is known}} for his {{attempts}} to translate the techniques of the Spanish Old Masters to a modern American idiom. Since Mora's initial travels in Spain coincided with the emergence of the Generation of '98, a portion of his oeuvre has been interpreted as an attempt to understand modern Spain and Spanish-U.S. relations {{in the aftermath of the}} Spanish-American War. He also produced a series of nudes, many with Spanish shawls as backdrops. He painted a portrait of his only daughter, Rosemary, [...] "In Costume" [...] in 1925, showing her as a little Senorita pushing a <b>doll</b> <b>carriage.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Crandall's {{father had}} begun selling baby {{carriages}} in the 1830s which were billed as [...] "the first baby carriages manufactured in America." [...] Jesse designed {{a tool to}} drill the ten evenly spaced holes in carriage wheels {{at the same time}} when he was only eleven years old. [...] Crandall was issued a number of patents for improvements and additions to the standard models. These included adding a brake to carriages, a model which folded, an oscillating axle, and designs for parasols and an umbrella hanger. An 1867 Crandall <b>doll</b> <b>carriage</b> model with a leather hood was once on display at the Museum of the City of New York. [...] As of October 2010, it was still in the Museum's collection.|$|R
5000|$|Opening his own detective agency, Alfalfa dons a deerstalker cap and rechristens himself [...] "X-10, Sooper Sleuth." [...] His first assignment: to {{find out}} who stole a box of candy from Darla. Suspecting that Leonard and Junior are the alleged culprits, Alfalfa and his chief (and only) {{operatives}} Buckwheat and Porky put a tail on the two youngsters. Unfortunately, the three junior gumshoes are sidetracked to a seaside amusement pier, where they find themselves trapped in a spooky-themed fun-house. Darla eventually discovers her candy was right where she left it- in her <b>doll</b> <b>carriage.</b> But it's too late: scared out of their wits by various ersatz ghosts, monsters and spooky moans and groans, our heroes vow to give up the detective business forever (as Alfalfa's [...] "Out of Bizzness" [...] sign on the door notes).|$|R
50|$|Heathcliff is also {{involved}} in an occasionally difficult relationship with Mr. Nutmeg, the moustached owner of the house he lives in. He is, however, loved by the young grandson, Iggy, whom he sees as his friend and owner (although he too can be annoyed with him, especially when Heathcliff hides his trombone); and Mrs. Nutmeg, Iggy's grandmother, overindulges him. He is also a friend of Iggy's playmates Willy, Iggy's brainy best friend; and Marcy, a neighborhood girl whom Heathcliff (dressed in baby clothes) has played play <b>doll</b> <b>carriage</b> with. Another character is Muggsy Faber, Westfinster's local bully and his bulldog, Spike, whom Heathcliff usually (and very easily) outwits. Another dog named Chauncey, unlike Spike, is friendly and lovable, and constantly licks Heathcliff's face. An occasional visitor is Heathcliff's father Pops Heathcliff who wears {{a black and white}} striped prison uniform.|$|R

25|$|He {{was born}} to Hannah A. (née Morrow) and Robert C. Martin (a brick merchant) in New York City on June 6, 1883. He was the {{youngest}} of nine children (seven boys, two girls). The family home was then situated between 8th and 9th Ave., on 31st St. in Manhattan. The Martin clan moved way up to Central Harlem on Edgecombe Ave. in 1891. They relocated within Central Harlem, to 129th St. and 5th Ave. in 1898. They belonged to the 24th Street M.E. Church (till 1891) and Calvary M.E. Church (till 1908). Paul's father Robert was the superintendent of their Sunday schools. Martin immensely enjoyed drawing as a boy. He studied commercial art at the National Academy of Design in New York City from 1902-06 (summer only 1906). He began working for the New York Tribune around 1905. This led to a seven-year stint as its art manager. Martin and family members moved from Upper Manhattan to Maplewood, New Jersey in 1908. He started competing in sanctioned tennis tournaments one year later. Martin married Lauretta Willey in 1912. (Her brother would own the Willey Book Co.) Their first rented home was in the University Heights section of the Bronx in 1912. They relocated a block away in 1915. He was employed with the O. J. Gude Company and Gotham Studios from c.1915–20. These two were giants in the advertising world. Martin joined the Artists' Guild and went freelance in early 1921. Paul and Lauretta moved from the Bronx to a rural area of Millwood, New York, in 1925. Their first owned home doubled as a working studio (upper floor) from 1925 to 1932. Its centerpiece was a long flat-top table that held the canvases, drawing pads, paint brushes and tubes. Also nearby were art books, easels and props for photo shoots. He occasionally used family members as models. Uncle Paul's niece Edna is shown, writing down the license number of a boy's wagon (for knocking over her <b>doll</b> <b>carriage),</b> on the Liberty cover of September 12, 1925. She's also highlighted on an American Junior Red Cross poster. His mother-in-law is shown basting a turkey for Thanksgiving, on the People's Home Journal cover of November 1928.|$|R
50|$|Young Lucretia Raymond {{lives with}} her strict Aunts Lucretia and Maria. During Christmastime, Lucretia is invited by the other {{schoolchildren}} to trim the Christmas tree at the schoolhouse {{in preparation for the}} Christmas celebrations. When she expresses her aunt’s predicted disapproval and refusal to let her participate in the trimming, the other girls insult her aunts, calling them “mean” and “stingy.” They also taunt Lucretia, saying she would not get anything on the Christmas tree; this scene caused Lucretia shame. She felt like she did not fit in with the other children and that her family was dishonored. In order to maintain her family honor and to fit in with the other children, Lucretia asks her aunts for presents, but they refuse her request, so Lucretia wrapped parcels for herself and left them at the schoolhouse while her aunts were out. During the distribution of presents at the Christmas celebration, Lucretia’s name was called many times, to her aunts’ amazement and Lucretia’s remorse. When she finally opened the packages, the aunts saw that the parcel contents were objects from their house. One package however, contained a rag doll made by Mrs. Emmons, one of the neighboring women. When Lucretia saw this doll, she cried and expressed surprise that someone had given her a gift. On the way home, she confessed to her aunts that she wanted the other children to think that she had things. The aunts confiscated her rag doll, and sent her to bed before deciding they were being too harsh. The next day, on Christmas Day, the aunts bought Lucretia a big wax <b>doll,</b> bedstead, baby <b>carriage</b> and bureau.|$|R
