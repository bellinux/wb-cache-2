40|$|With {{large numbers}} of refugee arrivals and {{numerous}} barriers to accessing services {{it is especially important}} that resources are efficiently and effectively directed to address the health needs of refugees. Ten databases were utilised to conduct the review, returning 156 titles which were assessed for validity based on specified criteria. The 14 critically appraised articles included in this review consist of experimental research and discussions on best practice. Articles consistently demonstrated the benefit of community-based mental health service in improving mental health outcomes. Themes of cultural awareness, language, setting, and post-migration stressors emerged across the articles. In addition, the studies also point to the gaps in research of a longitudinal nature and ones that deal with scattered populations post migration. Community based interventions proved valuable for improving the mental health of refugees. However, additional interventions and evaluations are required to draw consistent <b>and</b> <b>conclusive</b> <b>judgments</b> on best practice in dealing with refugee mental health issues...|$|R

500|$|Secondly, {{there is}} a {{difference}} between the kinds of tribunals the decisions of which are being considered for judicial review. The source of this reasoning is the dissenting judgment of Lord Justice Geoffrey Lane in Pearlman v. Keepers and Governors of Harrow School (1978). Lord Browne-Wilkinson noted that this dissenting judgment was approved by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in South East Asia Fire Bricks Sdn. Bhd. v. Non-Metallic Mineral Products Manufacturing Employees Union (1980), and also by a majority in Re Racal Communications Ltd. (1980). In the latter case, Lord Diplock highlighted that the decision in Anisminic only applies to administrative bodies or tribunals as {{there is a}} presumption that Parliament does not intend such bodies to be the final arbiters of questions of law. This can be contrasted with courts of law in respect of which such a presumption is not present. Instead, the presumption is that [...] "where Parliament had provided that the decision of an inferior court was <b>final</b> <b>and</b> <b>conclusive</b> the High Court should not be astute to find that the inferior court's decision on a question of law had not been made <b>final</b> <b>and</b> <b>conclusive,</b> thereby excluding the jurisdiction to review it." ...|$|R
