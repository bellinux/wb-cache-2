The condensate in Bose–holes exists in the case when temperature is not low. In our previous papers we applied the quantum statistics approach to linguistic statistics [1]. To each word a frequency dictionary assigns its number of occurrences in the corresponding corpus of texts. There may be several words with the same number of occurrences. The rank of a word (i. <b>e.,</b> the <b>order</b> <b>number</b> of a word in a frequency dictionary) is measured from the word A 1 with the highest number of occurrences s in a given corpus of texts. The number of all words with the same number of occurrences i we designate as Ni.

50|$|The star hosts {{four other}} planets {{discovered}} so far, although Kepler-186 b, c, <b>d,</b> and <b>e</b> (in <b>order</b> of increasing orbital radius), being {{too close to}} their star, are considered too hot to have liquid water. The four innermost planets are probably tidally locked, but Kepler-186f is in a higher orbit, where the star's tidal effects are much weaker, so the time could have been insufficient for its spin to slow down significantly. Because of the very slow evolution of red dwarfs, {{the age of the}} Kepler-186 system was poorly constrained, although {{it is likely to be}} greater than a few billion years. Recent results have placed the age at around 4 billion years. The chance that it is tidally locked is approximately 50%. Since it is closer to its star than Earth is to the Sun, it will probably rotate much more slowly than Earth; its day could be weeks or months long (see Tidal effects on rotation rate, axial tilt and orbit).|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} {{class of}} problems involves training deep neural networks with sparse prediction targets {{of very high}} dimension D. These occur naturally in e. g. neural language models or the learning of word-embeddings, often posed as predicting the probability of next words among a vocabulary of size D (e. g. 200 000). Computing the equally large, but typically non-sparse D-dimensional output vector from a last hidden layer of reasonable dimension <b>d</b> (<b>e.</b> g. 500) incurs a prohibitive O(Dd) computational cost for each example, as does updating the D x d output weight matrix and computing the gradient needed for backpropagation to previous layers. While efficient handling of large sparse network inputs is trivial, the case of large sparse targets is not, and has thus so far been sidestepped with approximate alternatives such as hierarchical softmax or sampling-based approximations during training. In this work we develop an original algorithmic approach which, {{for a family of}} loss functions that includes squared error and spherical softmax, can compute the exact loss, gradient update for the output weights, and gradient for backpropagation, all in O(d^ 2) per example instead of O(Dd), remarkably without ever computing the D-dimensional output. The proposed algorithm yields a speedup of D/ 4 <b>d,</b> i. <b>e.</b> two <b>orders</b> of magnitude for typical sizes, for that critical part of the computations that often dominates the training time in this kind of network architecture.

40|$|Stimulation of the {{sympathetic}} nerves innervating the rodent vas deferens elicits excitatory junction potentials (ejps). Intermittent transient accelerations in the rising phase of these ejps, termed discrete events (<b>d.</b> <b>e.</b> s.), were observed. D. e. s. {{were shown to}} reflect packets of transmitter acting on the recording cell. They vary in latency, amplitude and time course. D. e. s. with similar latency and time course have been associated into 'families'. Families of <b>d.</b> <b>e.</b> s., generally, have multimodal amplitude distributions with clearly defined modes. Families were shown to reflect transmitter release from a single terminal nerve fibre. Variation in [Ca]o altered the relative proportion of occurrence of large and small <b>d.</b> <b>e.</b> s., in a family, without affecting the modes themselves. Facilitation had the same effect. Therefore, families of <b>d.</b> <b>e.</b> s. represent the packeted, intermittent, release of transmitter from a single release site which may be either one varicosity {{or a group of}} varicosities on a single nerve fibre. Spontaneous <b>d.</b> <b>e.</b> s. have also been observed. In most cells the amplitude distribution of spontaneous <b>d.</b> <b>e.</b> s. was unimodal and this mode was equal to the smallest evoked <b>d.</b> <b>e.</b> mode in the same cell. Transmitter release from individual release sites could be modulated by ?-adrenoreceptor agonists and antagonists. However, the effect of such drugs was not consistent with the presence of an endogenous system of modulation via prejunctional ?-receptors. No evidence could be found for endogenous inhibitory modulation of release from pulse to pulse. Rather, short term facilitation appeared to occur. Blockade of neuronal uptake of noradrenaline by desmethylimipramine had no effect on <b>d.</b> <b>e.</b> s. Higher concentrations of desmethylimipramine altered the time course of ejps and <b>d.</b> <b>e.</b> s. Finally <b>d.</b> <b>e.</b> s. were recorded in the rat tail artery.
