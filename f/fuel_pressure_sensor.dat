It is also far more humid (100 % RH condensing) than the more typical 95 % RH non-condensing at 40 C (4 % RH maximum at 100 C). The work focused on four types of <b>sensors,</b> Temperature, <b>Pressure,</b> Air Flow and Relative Humidity. Initial design goals were established using a market research technique called Market Driven Product Definition (MDPD). A series of {{interviews were conducted with}} various users and system designers in their facilities. The interviewing team was trained in data taking and analysis per the MDPD process. The final result was a prioritized and weighted list of both requirements and desires for each sensor. Work proceeded on concept development for the 4 types of sensors. At the same time, users were developing the actual fuel cell systems and gaining knowledge and experience in the use of sensors and controls systems. This resulted in changes to requirements and desires that were not anticipated during the MDPD process. The concepts developed met all the predicted requirements.

Using a <b>pressure</b> <b>sensor</b> relying upon resonant oscillations to determine pressure, a driving circuit drives such a <b>pressure</b> <b>sensor</b> at resonance and tracks resonant frequency and amplitude shifts with changes in pressure. Pressure changes affect the Q-factor of the resonating portion of the <b>pressure</b> <b>sensor.</b> Such Q-factor changes are detected by the driving/sensing circuit which in turn tracks the changes in resonant frequency to maintain the <b>pressure</b> <b>sensor</b> at resonance. Changes in the Q-factor are reflected in changes of amplitude of the resonating <b>pressure</b> <b>sensor.</b> In response, upon sensing the changes in the amplitude, the driving circuit changes the force or strength of the electrostatic driving signal to maintain the resonator at constant amplitude. The amplitude of the driving signals become a direct measure of the changes in pressure as the operating characteristics of the resonator give rise to a linear response curve for the amplitude of the driving signal.
