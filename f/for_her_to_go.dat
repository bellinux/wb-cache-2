5|$|It was {{to prove}} this revolutionary {{technology}} that Dreadnought was designed in January 1905, laid down in October 1905 and sped to completion by 1906. She carried ten 12-inch guns, had an 11-inch armor belt, {{and was the first}} large ship powered by turbines. She mounted her guns in five turrets; three on the centerline (one forward, two aft) and two on the wings, giving her at her launch twice the broadside of any other warship. She retained a number of 12-pound (3-inch, 76mm) quick-firing guns for use against destroyers and torpedo-boats. Her armor was heavy enough <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> head-to-head with any other ship in a gun battle, and conceivably win.|$|E
5|$|When Archie returns, he {{attempts}} to reconcile with Peggy, but {{comes up with a}} plan to steal the Mitchells' business, The Queen Victoria public house, with Janine's help. However, Janine, along with Ryan, whom she is dating, plans to steal it from Archie at the last minute. Peggy's daughter Sam Mitchell (Danniella Westbrook), who has been in Brazil on the run from police due to her involvement in the murder of Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), returns to Walford, thinking the charges have been dropped. She is subsequently arrested, and the Mitchells put up £250,000 bail to have her released. Archie convinces Sam to leave again, paying <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> Phil is then forced to take out a loan from Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). Ian accepts, on the condition that if the loan is not paid back within a certain time, he becomes owner of The Queen Victoria. Archie and Janine learn of this and try to get Ian to sell the loan to them. When Ian's wife Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) leaves him, Janine gets him drunk and has sex with him, making an audio recording of them together. Archie and Janine blackmail Ian into selling them the loan and Archie tells the Mitchells they are trespassing. Once Archie finds out that Janine plans to fleece him, he proposes to her to keep her from going astray. Ryan is hurt by this setback and ends his relationship with her. Ronnie stands up to Archie and he pushes her into the bar, not knowing she is pregnant, though Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons) then reveals it. Ronnie has a miscarriage and Peggy tells Archie he has killed another of Ronnie's children, warning him to stay away from her. Peggy eventually hands over the keys and the family of Peggy, Phil, Ronnie, Roxy, Ben Mitchell (Charlie Jones) and Roxy's baby Amy Mitchell leave on 24 December 2009. They end up being taken in by Jack, who vows revenge on Archie.|$|E
25|$|Jelinek {{was criticized}} for not {{accepting}} the prize in person; instead, a video message {{was presented at the}} ceremony. Others appreciated how Jelinek revealed that she suffers from agoraphobia and social phobia, paranoid conditions that developed when she first decided to write seriously. Both conditions are anxiety disorders which can be highly disruptive to everyday functioning yet are often concealed by those affected, out of shame, or feelings of inadequacy. She has said her anxiety disorders make it impossible <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to the cinema or board an airplane (in an interview she wished to be able to fly to New York to see the skyscrapers one day before dying), and incapable of taking part in any ceremony.|$|E

Their physical relationship ended that night, and Viv was subsequently rejected when Mallaby sent her a letter from Oxford University saying he was forcibly engaged to someone else by his parents. Viv's second love affair was with her German boss, Kurt Rainer, by whom she would eventually become pregnant. She informed Rainer and he paid <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Switzerland to have an abortion, telling her that their affair was over. After the procedure, Viv returned to her native Canada and started her journey through North America, stopping to work at [...] "The Dreamy Pines Motor Court" [...] in the Adirondack Mountains for managers Jed and Mildred Phancey.|$|E
500|$|After {{returning}} to London, Mills asked Karmal to marry her. Karmal said yes, but on one condition: [...] "I told her I couldn't marry {{her until she}} did something about her compulsive lying, and she agreed to see a psychiatrist for eight weeks. She admitted she had a problem {{and said it was}} because she'd been forced to lie as a child by her father". Although Mills proposed to Karmal, she later said that every man she has been out with [...] "has asked me to marry him within a week". The couple married on 6 May 1989. While married to Karmal, she suffered two ectopic pregnancies, so Karmal paid <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on holiday to Croatia with his children and ex-wife (with whom Mills had become friends) in 1990, but Mills ended up living with her ski instructor, Miloš Pogačar, shortly before the Croatian War began. Mills set up a refugee crisis centre in London, helping over 20 people to escape the war. She drove to deliver donations to Croatia, taking modelling assignments in Austria on the way to pay for the trip, later saying that she [...] "worked on the front line in a war zone in the former Yugoslavia for two years where there were mines everywhere that weren't marked". Karmal and Mills were divorced in 1991 and Mills was later engaged to Raffaele Mincione (a bond dealer for the Industrial Bank of Japan) in 1993.|$|E

She is wearing solid gold earrings and other things that Old Mack has given her. Old Mack forces himself on Rosa despite her protests and struggles.

She then asks Rosa if she has [...] "told" [...] Ephraim yet, to which she responds that she has not. Rosa goes and wakes Ephraim.

In 1996, Capitol Records was preparing a contract for Underwood but canceled it when company management changed. Underwood said of the event, [...] "I honestly think it's a lot better that nothing {{came out of it}} now, because I wouldn't have been ready then. Everything has a way of working out." [...] While at Checotah High School, she was an Honor Society member, a cheerleader, and played basketball and softball. Underwood graduated from Checotah High School in 2001 as salutatorian. She chose not to pursue singing after graduation. She said, [...] "After high school, I pretty much gave up on the dream of singing. I had reached a point in my life where I had to be practical and prepare for my future in the 'real world'". She attended Northeastern State University in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, graduating magna cum laude in 2006 with a bachelor's degree in mass communication and an emphasis in journalism.

Bergman {{said that it was}} [...] "only appropriate" [...] that the couple found each other, explaining: [...] "Wherever Sharon goes, she is embarrassed. Will Phyllis come walking around the corner? But Sharon doesn't have any reason to be embarrassed with Jack." [...] However, Bergman also noted that Jack's intamicy with her [...] "all happens so quickly" [...] which could indicate he was up to something manipulative. Case praised the marriage as being a good representation of modern-day marriages. Additionally, she felt that Sharon had [...] "lost her identity" [...] after divorcing Nick and Cassie's death, and found a new one in her marriage to Jack. Nick and Sharon remained close despite their separate marriages. In 2007, Nick ended up in a plane crash, losing his memory. When he returned, he thought it was 2005, believing he was married to Sharon and Cassie was alive. He even kissed Sharon; but regained his memory and returned to Phyllis and their infant daughter, Summer. Phyllis became jealous of Sharon's place in Nick's life, prompting her to write an article in their magazine Restless Style, in which she described Sharon as a [...] "needy" [...] "gum-chewing twit" [...] who twirls her hair. Nick was angry at Phyllis for berating the mother of his children, although it was evident that he still loved Sharon and was protective of her. Stafford said: [...] "He [...] Freaks.
