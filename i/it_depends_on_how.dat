[...] Flinn was {{initially}} unsure about the numerous classical quotations, but when Plummer was cast, Meyer enthusiastically added more. He said, [...] "Whether it's pretentious or not, I think <b>it</b> <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> it's used.

500|$|During the Bulls' playoff run in 1993, {{controversy}} arose when Jordan {{was seen}} gambling in Atlantic City, New Jersey, {{the night before}} {{a game against the}} New York Knicks. In that same year, he admitted that he had to cover $57,000 in gambling losses, and author Richard Esquinas wrote a book claiming he had won $1.25million from Jordan on the golf course. In 2005, Jordan talked to Ed Bradley of the CBS evening show 60 Minutes about his gambling and admitted that he made some reckless decisions. Jordan stated, [...] "Yeah, I've gotten myself into situations where I would not walk away and I've pushed the envelope. Is that compulsive? Yeah, <b>it</b> <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> you look at it. If you're willing to jeopardize your livelihood and your family, then yeah." [...] When Bradley asked him if his gambling ever got to the level where it jeopardized his livelihood or family, Jordan replied, [...] "No." ...|$|E

30|$|From a {{financial}} perspective, Medicare spent $ 20, 245, 957 in 2012 on reimbursements for ICD- 9 inpatient procedural code 78.55 {{after adjusting for}} inflation to 2014. While this is widely {{considered to be a}} cost-saving procedure, future studies should compare the cost effectiveness of it with the treatment modalities that are potentially replacing <b>it.</b> <b>Depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> many of those treatments fail and eventually require prophylactic fixation, the use of ICD- 9 78.55 from the beginning may be the most cost-effective approach.|$|R

2500|$|Walken also {{starred in}} Barry Levinson's Envy, {{in which he}} plays J-Man, a crazy guy who helps Ben Stiller's character, and in his {{starring}} role in 2004's Around the Bend he again has a dancing scene as he portrays an absentee father who has fled prison to reunite with his father, his son, and the grandson he never knew before dying. Walken {{played the role of}} Paul Rayburn in 2004's Man on Fire, where, when speaking about the imminent destructive actions of John Creasy (Denzel Washington), his character states: [...] "A man can be an artist... in anything, food, whatever. <b>It</b> <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> good he is at it.

50|$|It is {{sometimes}} said that:The Ale Conner was {{a type of}} early tax-man whose job it was to test the quality and strength of beer, not by quaffing, but by sitting in a puddle of it! They travelled from pub to pub clad in sturdy leather britches.

30|$|Raters also {{varied in}} how they treated {{repeated}} mistakes of form, such as spelling or grammar. When asked how they react if a student repeatedly misspells a word, some raters said that they counted it as a single mistake, while others said they counted it as a separate mistake each time it occurred. For others, <b>it</b> <b>depended</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> serious they felt the mistake was.

[...] But if the doctor has just had lunch and if his breathing is short-circuited with huckleberry-pie, he says very firmly: [...] "No, I don't want you to eat anything at all: absolutely not a bite; it won't hurt you, a little self-denial in the matter of eating is the best thing in the world." ...|$|E
60|$|Or, I might say, <b>it</b> <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> far {{the process}} had gone, of transmuting life into truth.

Each age, it is found, must write its own books; or rather, each generation for the next succeeding. The books of an older period will not fit this.|$|E
60|$|I find, except Samuel Johnson, no man {{of equal}} {{veracity}} with Friedrich Wilhelm in that epoch: and Johnson too, {{with all his}} tongue-learning, had not logic enough. In fact, <b>it</b> <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> much conviction you have. Blessed be Heaven, there is {{here and there a}} man born who loves truth as truth should be loved, with all his heart and all his soul; and hates untruth with a corresponding perfect hatred. Such men, in polite circles, which understand that certainly truth is better than untruth, but that you must be polite to both, are liable to {{get to the end of}} their logic. Even Johnson had a bellow in him; though Johnson could at any time withdraw into silence, HIS kingdom lying all under his own hat. How much more Friedrich Wilhelm, who had no logic whatever; and whose kingdom lay without him, far and wide, a thing he could not withdraw from. The rugged Orson, he needed to be right. From utmost Memel down to Wesel again, ranked in a straggling manner round the half-circumference of Europe, all manner of things and persons were depending on him, and on his being right, not wrong, in his notion.|$|E

6000|$|About coming up, no, that's impossible; for I am {{worse than}} a bankrupt. I have at the present six shillings and a penny; I have a {{sounding}} lot of bills for Christmas; new dress suit, for instance, the old one having gone for Parliament House; and new white shirts {{to live up to}} my new profession; I'm as gay and swell and gummy as can be; only all my boots leak; one pair water, and the other two simple black mud; so that my rig is more for the eye than a very solid comfort to myself. That is my budget. Dismal enough, and no prospect of any coin coming in; at least for months. So that here I am, I almost fear, for the winter; certainly till after Christmas, and then <b>it</b> <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> my bills [...] "turn out" [...] whether it shall not be till spring. So, meantime, I must whistle in my cage. My cage is better by one thing; I am an Advocate now. If you ask me why that makes it better, I would remind you that in the most distressing circumstances a little consequence goes a long way, and even bereaved relatives stand on precedence round the coffin. I idle finely. I read Boswell's Life of Johnson, Martin's History of France, Allan Ramsay, Olivier Basselin, all sorts of rubbish àpropos of Burns, Commines, Juvénal des Ursins, etc. I walk about the Parliament House five forenoons a week, in wig and gown; I have either a five or six mile walk, or an hour or two hard skating on the rink, every afternoon, without fail.|$|E
60|$|It is {{a ridiculous}} demand which England and America make, that you shall speak {{so that they}} can {{understand}} you. Neither men nor toadstools grow so. As if that were important, and there were not enough to understand you without them. As if Nature could support but one order of understandings, could not sustain birds as well as quadrupeds, flying as well as creeping things, and hush and whoa, which Bright can understand, were the best English. As if there were safety in stupidity alone. I fear chiefly lest my expression may not be extra-vagant enough, may not wander far enough beyond the narrow limits of my daily experience, so as to be adequate to the truth of which I have been convinced. Extra vagance! <b>it</b> <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> you are yarded. The migrating buffalo, which seeks new pastures in another latitude, is not extravagant like the cow which kicks over the pail, leaps the cowyard fence, and runs after her calf, in milking time. I desire to speak somewhere without bounds; like a man in a waking moment, to men in their waking moments; for I am convinced that I cannot exaggerate enough even to lay the foundation of a true expression. Who that has heard a strain of music feared then lest he should speak extravagantly any more forever? In view of the future or possible, we should live quite laxly and undefined in front, our outlines dim and misty on that side; as our shadows reveal an insensible perspiration toward the sun. The volatile truth of our words should continually betray the inadequacy of the residual statement. Their truth is instantly translated; its literal monument alone remains. The words which express our faith and piety are not definite; yet they are significant and fragrant like frankincense to superior natures.|$|E

5|$|The halogens darken in colour as {{the group}} is descended: {{fluorine}} is a very pale yellow gas, chlorine is greenish-yellow, and bromine is a reddish-brown volatile liquid. Iodine conforms to the prevailing trend, being a shiny black crystalline solid that melts at 114°C and boils at 183°C to form a violet gas. This trend occurs because the wavelengths of visible light absorbed by the halogens increase down the group (though astatine may not conform to <b>it,</b> <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>how</b> metallic <b>it</b> turns out to be). Specifically, the violet colour of iodine gas results from the electron transition between the highest occupied antibonding πg molecular orbital and the lowest vacant antibonding σu molecular orbital.|$|R
5000|$|Derek Bickerton has {{posited that}} iconic signs, both verbal and gestural, were crucial in the {{evolution}} of human language. Animal communication systems, Bickerton has argued, are largely composed of indexical (and, occasionally, iconic) signs, whereas in human language, [...] "most words are symbolic, and ... without symbolic words we couldn’t have language".
