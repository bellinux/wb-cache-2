5000|$|The C.II {{was adapted}} to the pure fighter role as the Roland D.I, but in this role the poor forward view {{proved to be a}} problem. A fire at the factory {{severely}} constrained production, and only 20 were built. A newer version with a more conventional layout, the Roland D.II, followed, whose fuselage was reduced in height to leave a gap with the upper wing but was otherwise similar overall. The competing Albatros D.I was preferred, and only about 230 examples were built, which were then mostly used on the eastern front and in Macedonia. The fuselage to wing gap was further increased in the D.III, but the temperamental 180 hp Argus As.III limited production to only a handful. Six D.IIs were delivered in July 1917 to the Bulgarian Air Force, and six D.IIIs were delivered in May 1918.Although the Wickelrumpf style of wood-structure monocoque fuselage was extremely strong, it was also very difficult and time-consuming to build. A new method of construction was introduced that used spruce planking running the length of the aircraft in place of the <b>formed</b> <b>plywood,</b> and the D.III was adapted using this technique to produce D.IV triplane and D.V biplane, both powered by the D.III's 160 hp Mercedes. The fuselage shell's construction technique for these aircraft resembled a clinker-planked boat hull in appearance when finished, and was named Klinkerrumpf (clinker body) construction, and was also patented by the firm. [...] A further adaptation of the D.IV with the 185 hp Benz Bz. III resulted in the Roland D.VI, which was entered in the First Fighter Competition trials at Adlershof in early 1918. Although the Fokker D.VII won that contest, the D.VI was also ordered into production as it used a different engine, {{and by the end of}} the war about 350 had been delivered. A large number of different versions using various engines were built as prototypes without entering production, as well as a triplane adaptation as the D.VI (also known as the Dr.I).|$|E

5000|$|Targes are {{generally}} round shields between 18 in and 21 in (45-55 cm) in diameter. The {{inside of the}} targe was formed from two very thin layers of flat wooden boards, with the grain of each layer {{at right angles to}} the other. They were fixed together with small wooden pegs, <b>forming</b> <b>plywood.</b> The front was covered with a tough cowhide, which was often decorated with embossed Celtic style patterns. This was fixed to the wood with many brass, or in some cases, silver, nails, and occasionally brass plates were also fixed to the face for strength and decoration. Some targes had center bosses of brass, and a few of these could accept a long steel spike, which screwed into a small [...] "puddle" [...] of lead that was fixed to the wood, under the boss. When not in use, the spike could be unscrewed and placed in a sheath {{on the back of the}} targe.

Many tests were also made on parallel-chord specimens of truss and <b>plywood</b> <b>forms</b> in place of the actual ribs and on parts of wing ribs, such as truss diagonals and sections of cap strips. It was found that for ribs of any size or proportions, when they were designed to obtain a well-balanced construction and were carefully manufactured, distinct types are of various efficiencies; the efficiency is based on the strength per unit of weight. In all types of ribs the heavier are the stronger per unit of weight. Reductions in the weight of wing ribs are accompanied even in efficient designs by a much greater proportional reduction in strength...|$|R

50|$|Tego {{film was}} {{developed}} in Germany around 1930 as a glue for waterproof plywood. It comprised a paper sheet pre-impregnated with a resole phenolic resin.

This became an important factor in time, when it was applied to use in aircraft construction.|$|R

50|$|A shear wall, in its {{simplest}} definition, is a {{wall where}} the entire material {{of the wall}} is employed in the resistance of both horizontal and vertical loads. A typical example is a brick or cinderblock wall. Since the wall material is used to hold the weight, as the wall expands in size, it must hold considerably more weight. Due to the features of a shear wall, it is acceptable for small constructions, such as suburban housing or an urban brownstone, to require low material costs and little maintenance. In this way, shear walls, typically in the <b>form</b> of <b>plywood</b> and framing, brick, or cinderblock, are used for these structures. For skyscrapers, though, as {{the size of the}} structure increases, so does the size of the supporting wall. Large structures such as castles and cathedrals inherently addressed these issues due to a large wall being advantageous (castles), or able to be designed around (cathedrals). Since skyscrapers seek to maximize the floor-space by consolidating structural support, shear walls tend to be used only in conjunction with other support systems.|$|R

In Paris he attended the 1925 Exposition Internationale des Arts DÃ©coratifs et Industriels Modernes, which influenced his approach to design. [...] He established a design consulting firm in New York City, and later the firm of Deskey-Vollmer (in partnership with Phillip Vollmer) which specialized in furniture and textile design. His designs in this era progressed from Art Deco to Streamline Moderne. Deskey first gained note as a designer when he created window displays for the Franklin Simon Department Store in Manhattan in 1926. In the 1930s, he won the competition to design the interiors for Radio City Music Hall. He sold geometrically painted objects through the fashionable shop of Rena Rosenthal, and did custom design work for her. In the 1940s he started the graphic design firm Donald Deskey Associates and made some of the most recognizable icons of the day. He designed the Crest toothpaste packaging, the Tide bullseye as well as a widely used New York City lamppost model. [...] In 1940 Deskey developed a decorative <b>form</b> of <b>plywood</b> which had a unique striated, or combed, look to it.

5000|$|Plywood {{production}} {{requires a}} good log, called a peeler, {{which is generally}} straighter and larger in diameter than one required for processing into dimensioned lumber by a sawmill. The log is laid horizontally and rotated about its long axis while a long blade is pressed into it, causing {{a thin layer of}} wood to peel off (much as a continuous sheet of paper from a roll). An adjustable nosebar, which may be solid or a roller, is pressed against the log during rotation, to create a [...] "gap" [...] for veneer to pass through between the knife and the nosebar. The nosebar partly compresses the wood as it is peeled; it controls vibration of the peeling knife; and assists in keeping the veneer being peeled to an accurate thickness. In this way the log is peeled into sheets of veneer, which are then cut to the desired oversize dimensions, to allow it to shrink (depending on wood species) when dried. The sheets are then patched, graded, glued together and then baked in a press at a temperature of at least , and at a pressure of up to [...] (but more commonly 200 psi) to <b>form</b> the <b>plywood</b> panel.

40|$|Optimization of structure`s {{topology}} {{that provides}} minimal material consumption, weight and good heat-moisture performance {{is one of}} the most challenging task in todayâs engineering science. Plywood structures provide a rational usage of wood (Sliseris and Rocens 2010) and one of the reasons is less sawdust in manufacturing. The typical hot-pressed plywood sheetâs maximal thickness is limited and in many cases there is insufficient bending stiffness. The object of research is plywood composite material that consists of top and bottom plywood flange and middle core that is <b>formed</b> from <b>plywood</b> ribs and foam-type material. As a result of structure complexity (many variable parameters) and highly material nonlinearity itâs topology optimization is very challenging problem. Therefore classical optimization methods, like response surface method may fail or find local optimum (Rao 2009). The optimization of plywood macro-structure`s topology is done by non-traditional optimization methods- Neural network (Yao 1999), Genetic algorithm (Goldberg 1989, Sliseris and Rocens 2011) and Simulated annealing method (Laarhoven and Aarts 1987). All of these methods are developed by inspiration of nature. The numerical simulation of plywood structure is done by classical (plane-stress) composite material method and Finite element method. The multi-objective structure optimization is done and minimized objective function`s are ratio of structures bending load bearing capacity and structure`s weight, heat conductivity and moisture caused structure`s expansion-shrink coefficient.
