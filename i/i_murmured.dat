60|$|<b>I</b> <b>murmured</b> {{something}} to the effect that I was extremely obliged.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>murmured,</b> {{though the}} {{atmospheric}} conditions {{were not really}} those described by the poet.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>murmured</b> {{something}} about being flattered, but I {{do not think that}} she heard me.|$|E
60|$|Yet <b>I</b> <b>murmur,</b> murmur on! O murmurs--you yourselves make me {{continue}} to sing, I know not why.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ay! your daughter, {{but still}} a woman. Do <b>I</b> <b>murmur?</b> Do <b>I</b> complain? Have I urged you to {{compromise}} your honour? I am ready for the sacrifice. My conduct is yours, but my feelings are my own.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Hip. Since I knew life, you've kept me in a rock; [...] And you, this day, have hurried me from thence, [...] Only {{to change}} my prison, not to free me. [...] <b>I</b> <b>murmur</b> not, but <b>I</b> may wonder at it.|$|R
6000|$|And {{wrapping}} {{my face in}} my hair, <b>I</b> <b>murmured,</b> [...] "In old age they ceased"; [...] And {{my tears}} were larger than berries, and <b>I</b> <b>murmured,</b> [...] "Where white clouds lie spread [...] "On Crevroe or broad Knockfefin, with many of old they feast [...] "On the floors of the gods." [...] He cried, [...] "No, the gods [...] a long time are dead." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>murmured</b> my thanks, {{and very}} deep and sincere were they. Then, having kissed his hand, I left him.|$|E
6000|$|I {{remained}} speechless for a time. Here {{was something}} unexpected and original {{enough to be}} altogether incomprehensible. <b>I</b> <b>murmured,</b> astounded: ...|$|E
6000|$|Farewell I breathe again To dim New England's shore, My heart shall beat {{not when}} I pant for thee no more. In yon green palmy isle, Beneath the tropic ray, <b>I</b> <b>murmur</b> never while For thee and thine I pray; [...] Far away, far away.|$|R
6000|$|And then <b>I</b> <b>murmur,</b> [...] "Surely God [...] Delighteth here to dwell; [...] This is {{the temple}} of his Son [...] Whom he doth love so well;" [...] But, when I hear the creed which saith, [...] This church alone is His, [...] I feel within my soul that He [...] Hath purer shrines than this.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> bowed, <b>murmuring</b> {{something}} of the joy I felt and the devotion I should entertain.|$|R
6000|$|... "Fancy, fancy!" [...] <b>I</b> <b>murmured.</b> And then, [...] "Tell me this, please--has {{she got a}} {{portrait}} of him? They are distressingly rare." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Yes,' <b>I</b> <b>murmured</b> over my dear book, 'the {{infinitely}} lugubrious crepuscule. A {{spectacle of}} barbarity unparalleled--hideous--cold-blooded, and yet touched with appalling grandeur.'" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>murmured</b> my {{acquiescence}} {{with his}} sentiments and my companion {{paused for a}} few minutes, his whole attention devoted to his dinner.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{will write}} you, dear mother, {{as soon as}} <b>I</b> can," [...] <b>murmured</b> <b>I,</b> as she charged me for the {{hundredth}} time, not fail to inform her of my safe arrival in New York.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And I shall {{know you}} are praying, better than <b>I</b> can,' <b>murmured</b> Nuttie, as she {{returned}} his good-night, and crept up to her chamber.|$|R
6000|$|Thus on {{the coffin}} loud and long [...] <b>I</b> strike--the <b>murmur</b> sent [...] Through the grey {{chambers}} to my song, [...] Shall be the accompaniment.|$|R
6000|$|... "But, Monsieur Berty?" [...] <b>I</b> <b>murmured,</b> my mind in a turmoil, my {{thoughts}} running riot through my brain. [...] "The Englishmen, the mules, the packs?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear me," [...] <b>I</b> <b>murmured,</b> [...] "so {{that is the}} {{explanation}} of your extraordinary behaviour. You rushed down to Styles, and found it still there?" ...|$|E
60|$|He refolded his {{handkerchief}} {{so as to}} bring a cooler surface {{in contact with the}} swelling, while <b>I</b> <b>murmured</b> something genial about the inscrutability of Providence.|$|E
60|$|For {{there on}} high--and <b>I</b> had <b>murmured</b> {{the last words}} all but inaudibly to myself--there played the spangling Pleiads, clear above {{her head in the}} twig-swept sky.|$|R
60|$|This and the {{following}} Sonnet [now XXVI.] were composed on {{what we call the}} 'far terrace' at Rydal Mount, where <b>I</b> have <b>murmured</b> out many thousands of my verses.|$|R
60|$|There are so {{many things}} to tell about. Where and how this mad voyage, with a mad crew, will end is beyond all surmise. But the Elsinore drives on, and day by day her history is bloodily written. And while murder is done, and while the whole {{floating}} drama moves toward the bleak southern ocean and the icy blasts of Cape Horn, I sit in the high place with the masters, unafraid, I am proud to say, in an ecstasy, I am proud to say, and <b>I</b> <b>murmur</b> over and over to myself--Margaret, a woman; Margaret, and desirable.|$|R
6000|$|I {{folded her}} in my arms, there, on the rusty-red South African desert. [...] "Then, Hilda dear," [...] <b>I</b> <b>murmured,</b> [...] "you will consent to marry me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "His Grace is very kind," [...] <b>I</b> <b>murmured.</b> [...] "I fear, however, {{that the}} people are not very much {{interested}} in lectures, even about their own neighbourhood." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>murmured</b> an assent, {{which was}} full of feeling, {{considering}} that I knew nothing at all about him; and I inquired what Mr. Traddles was by profession.|$|E
6000|$|You'll {{stop with}} us [...] And we will hunt {{the deer and}} the wild bulls [...] And, when we have grown weary, light our fires [...] In sandy places where the wool-white foam [...] <b>Is</b> <b>murmuring</b> and breaking, {{and it may be}} [...] That {{long-haired}} women will come out of the dunes [...] To dance in the yellow fire-light. You hang your head, [...] Young man, as if {{it was not a good}} life; [...] And yet what's better than to hurl the spear, [...] And hear the long-remembering harp, and dance; [...] Friendship grows quicker in the murmuring dark; [...] But I can see there's no more need for words [...] And that you'll be my friend now.|$|R
5000|$|Paganus {{acquired}} {{its religious}} connotations by the mid-4th century. As {{early as the}} 5th century, paganos was metaphorically used to denote persons outside the bounds of the Christian community. Following the sack of Rome by pagan Visigoths just over fifteen years after the Christian persecution of paganism under Theodosius <b>I,</b> <b>murmurs</b> began to spread that the old gods had taken greater care of the city than the Christian God. In response, Augustine of Hippo wrote De Civitate Dei Contra Paganos ('The City of God against the Pagans'). In it, he contrasted the fallen [...] "city of Man" [...] to the [...] "city of God" [...] of which all Christians were ultimately citizens. Hence, the foreign invaders were [...] "not of the city" [...] or [...] "rural".|$|R
60|$|I am sure, {{though you}} don't like photographs, you say, {{that you will}} find nothing lacking in what we send you and dearest Nonno of our Penini. It isn't like him, it's himself. As for me, <b>I</b> <b>murmur,</b> {{in the depths of}} my vanity, that like the Emperor Napoleon (and the devil) I'm not so black as I'm painted; but I forgive {{everything}} for Pen's sake. Robert is not very favourably represented, I think. The beard on the upper lip had not been properly clipped, and makes the space seem too long for him. Another time I will mend that. I was very unusually tired after my journey, but am getting past it. Weather was hot; but within two days we have had some cooling rain.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>murmured</b> my sympathy. Just at that moment, Guest {{entered and}} passed {{through to the}} little office, all smiles and bows--the typical restaurateur. Madame eyed him keenly.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have come}} into such good fortune since I saw you last, Miss Havisham," [...] <b>I</b> <b>murmured.</b> [...] "And I am so {{grateful}} for it, Miss Havisham!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell me {{all about}} him," [...] <b>I</b> <b>murmured,</b> sobbing. [...] "For, Jack, I {{remember}} now, he was so good and kind, and I loved him--I loved him." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Well, Phil,' {{said his}} brother, good-humouredly, 'any way, till this Love comes {{that is to}} let us out, don't let Moor or fiend come between us. Let me keep my {{credence}} for the honest Bailli's daughters at Lucon; and remember I would give my life to free you, but I cannot give away my faith.' Philip bent his head. He was of too stubborn a mould to express contrition or affection, but he mused for five minutes, then called Humfrey, and at the last moment, as the heavy tread came up-stairs, he turned round and said, 'You're in the right on't there, Berry. Hap what hap, the foul fiend may carry off the conjurer before <b>I</b> <b>murmur</b> at you again! Still I wish you had seen him. You would know 'tis sooth.' ...|$|R
60|$|Neither do <b>I</b> {{find any}} <b>murmuring</b> {{on some other}} points of greater importance, where this {{favourite}} maxim is not so strictly observed.|$|R
