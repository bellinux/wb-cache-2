By this time {{over half of}} JAL's revenue was <b>generated</b> <b>on</b> transpacific routes to the United States and the airline was lobbying the United States for fifth freedom rights to fly transatlantic routes from the East Coast. The transpacific route was extended east from San Francisco to New York in November 1966 and to London in 1967; flights between San Francisco and London ended in December 1972.|$|E

There is a growth process {{at the beginning of the}} ascent that may last for several cycles until the bubbles have reached a critical size when they are either filtered in the lung or stopped at the tissue level. It is postulated that the production of a shower of small arterial bubbles during the first minutes of the initial ascent is a precursor for DCS symptoms.|$|E

However, while in recent years interest in it has been growing, empirical evidence on the effects that the application of game elements can <b>generate</b> <b>on</b> users’ behaviour is still lacking. We present {{the results of a}} study as a step towards designing gamification with better understanding of the possible effects that each game element could <b>generate</b> <b>on</b> end users. By involving three groups of experts: game designers, learning scientists and specialists in technology-enhanced learning (TEL), we assessed a selected number of 21 game design patterns in relation to the effects these could <b>generate</b> <b>on</b> learning performance, goal achievement and engagement of learners if implemented in a Massive Online Open Course (MOOC).

5|$|The {{rock that}} makes up Gareloi Island and its volcano is {{estimated}} to be of Pleistocene age. Several factors contribute to this inference, mainly the presence of glaciers and edifice failure (landslide) debris. The rock, which comprises dissected lava flows and pyroclastic masses, has been shaped by glacial retreat that began around 10,000 years past and fleshed out newly formed rocks. Other landslides have been <b>generated</b> <b>on</b> the north and east flanks of the volcano.|$|E
5|$|The Quantitative Precipitation Forecast (abbreviated QPF) is the {{expected}} amount of liquid precipitation accumulated over a specified time period over a specified area. A QPF will be specified when a measurable precipitation type reaching a minimum threshold is forecast for any hour during a QPF valid period. Precipitation forecasts {{tend to be}} bound by synoptic hours such as 0000, 0600, 1200 and 1800GMT. Terrain is considered in QPFs by use of topography or based upon climatological precipitation patterns from observations with fine detail. Starting {{in the mid to}} late 1990s, QPFs were used within hydrologic forecast models to simulate impact to rivers throughout the United States. Forecast models show significant sensitivity to humidity levels within the planetary boundary layer, or in the lowest levels of the atmosphere, which decreases with height. QPF can be <b>generated</b> <b>on</b> a quantitative, forecasting amounts, or a qualitative, forecasting the probability of a specific amount, basis. Radar imagery forecasting techniques show higher skill than model forecasts within 6 to 7hours of the time of the radar image. The forecasts can be verified through use of rain gauge measurements, weather radar estimates, or a combination of both. Various skill scores can be determined to measure the value of the rainfall forecast.|$|E

25|$|While {{alternative}} versions {{had been}} developed before him, by Eduard Jäger von Jaxtthal and others, Snellen developed his eponymous eye chart in 1862 to measure visual acuity, which rapidly become the global standard. The most significant innovation was his use {{of what he called}} optotypes, specially designed characters <b>generated</b> <b>on</b> a 5x5 grid, rather than using standard fonts. They provide a physical standard measure that could be used when printing the chart. Standard vision was measured as the ability to correctly read a line of optotype characters when they subtended 5 minutes of arc and were separated by 1 minute of arc.|$|E

25|$|Pitches in Australia have {{traditionally}} been known {{to be good for}} fast bowlers because of the amount of bounce that can be <b>generated</b> <b>on</b> these surfaces. In particular, the pitch at the WACA Ground in Perth is regarded as being possibly the quickest pitch in the world. The Gabba in Brisbane is also known to assist fast bowlers with its bounce. However, these kinds of bouncy pitches also open up more areas for run-scoring, as they promote the playing of a lot of pull, hook and cut shots. Batsmen who play these shots well have a lot of success on these pitches.|$|E
25|$|Mode 7 was a Teletext mode, {{extremely}} economical {{on memory}} and an original requirement {{due to the}} BBC's own use of broadcast teletext (Ceefax).

Train time displays at UK stations were driven by BBC Master computers in this mode until around the late 1990s. Mode 7 used only 1 KB for video RAM by storing each character as its ASCII code, rather than its bitmap image as was needed for the other modes.|$|E

25|$|The plant {{provides}} {{electricity to}} northern Illinois {{and the city}} of Chicago. In 2005 it <b>generated</b> <b>on</b> average about 2,450MWe, enough power to supply about 2million average American homes. The station employs over 600people, mostly from Ogle and Winnebago Counties and features two prominent 495-foot (150.9m) cooling towers. The Byron plant has been subject to some controversy with respect to a lawsuit in 1981 with concerns over tritium contamination in groundwater. Tritium contamination at Byron and other Illinois nuclear power plants led the state of Illinois to pass legislation requiring plants to report such contamination to the state within 24hours. Plant security was increased after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001.|$|E
25|$|Water is {{also used}} in many large scale {{industrial}} processes, such as thermoelectric power production, oil refining, fertilizer production and other chemical plant use, and natural gas extraction from shale rock. Discharge of untreated water from industrial uses is pollution. Pollution includes discharged solutes (chemical pollution) and increased water temperature (thermal pollution). Industry requires pure water for many applications and utilizes a variety of purification techniques both in water supply and discharge. Most of this pure water is <b>generated</b> <b>on</b> site, either from natural freshwater or from municipal grey water. Industrial consumption of water is generally much lower than withdrawal, due to laws requiring industrial grey water to be treated {{and returned to the}} environment. Thermoelectric powerplants using cooling towers have high consumption, nearly equal to their withdrawal, as most of the withdrawn water is evaporated as part of the cooling process. The withdrawal, however, is lower than in once-through cooling systems.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{disinfection}} method involves {{some form of}} chlorine or its compounds such as chloramine or chlorine dioxide. Chlorine is a strong oxidant that rapidly kills many harmful micro-organisms. Because chlorine is a toxic gas, {{there is a danger}} of a release associated with its use. This problem is avoided by the use of sodium hypochlorite, which is a relatively inexpensive solution used in household bleach that releases free chlorine when dissolved in water. Chlorine solutions can be <b>generated</b> <b>on</b> site by electrolyzing common salt solutions. A solid form, calcium hypochlorite, releases chlorine on contact with water. Handling the solid, however, requires greater routine human contact through opening bags and pouring than the use of gas cylinders or bleach which are more easily automated. The generation of liquid sodium hypochlorite is both inexpensive and safer than the use of gas or solid chlorine.|$|E
