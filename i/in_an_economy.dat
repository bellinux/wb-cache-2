5|$|The {{loanable funds}} {{doctrine}} extends the classical theory, which determined {{the interest rate}} solely by savings and investment, in that it adds bank credit. The total amount of credit available <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>economy</b> can exceed private savings because the bank system {{is in a position}} to create credit out of thin air. Hence, the equilibrium (or market) interest rate is not only influenced by the propensities to save and invest but also by the creation or destruction of fiat money and credit.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the {{relationship}} between price level and output was explained by the quantity theory of money; David Hume had presented such a theory in his 1752 work Of Money (Essays, Moral, Political, and Literary, Part II, Essay III). Quantity theory viewed the entire economy through Say's law, which stated that whatever is supplied to the market will be sold—in short, that markets always clear. In this view, money is neutral and cannot impact the real factors <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>economy</b> like output levels. This {{was consistent with the}} classical dichotomy view that real aspects of the economy and nominal factors, such as price levels and money supply, can be considered independent from one another. For example, adding more money to an economy would be expected only to raise prices, not to create more goods.|$|E
5|$|In Essai, Cantillon {{provided}} an advanced version of John Locke's quantity theory of money, focusing on relative inflation and {{the velocity of}} money. Cantillon suggested that inflation occurs gradually and that the new supply of money has a localised effect on inflation, effectively originating the concept of non-neutral money. Furthermore, he posited that the original recipients of new money enjoy higher standards of living {{at the expense of}} later recipients. The concept of relative inflation, or a disproportionate rise in prices among different goods <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>economy,</b> is now known as the Cantillon effect. Cantillon also considered changes in the velocity of money (quantity of exchanges made within a specific amount of time) influential on prices, although not to the same degree as changes in the quantity of money. While he believed that the money supply consisted only of specie, he conceded that increases in money substitutes—or bank notes—could affect prices by effectively increasing the velocity of circulating of deposited specie. Apart from distinguishing money from money substitute, he also distinguished between bank notes offered as receipts for specie deposits and bank notes circulating beyond the quantity of specie—or fiduciary media—suggesting that the volume of fiduciary media is strictly limited by people's confidence in its redeemability. He considered fiduciary media a useful tool to abate the downward pressure that hoarding of specie has on the velocity of money.|$|E

25|$|The {{continuous}} interplay (exchange or trade) done {{by economic}} actors in all markets sets the prices for all {{goods and services}} which, in turn, make the rational managing of scarce resources possible. At the same time, the decisions (choices) made by the same actors, while they are pursuing their own interest, determine the level of output (production), consumption, savings, and investment, <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>economy,</b> {{as well as the}} remuneration (distribution) paid to the owners of labour (in the form of wages), capital (in the form of profits) and land (in the form of rent). Each period, as if they were in a giant feedback system, economic players influence the pricing processes and the economy, and are in turn influenced by them until a steady state (equilibrium) of all variables involved is reached or until an external shock throws the system toward a new equilibrium point. Because of the autonomous actions of rational interacting agents, the economy is a complex adaptive system.|$|E
25|$|Poverty and {{inequality}} are significant social problems that Portugal {{has attempted to}} address VIA various social policy measures. The European economic crisis has {{increased the number of}} households that remain below the poverty line in Portugal with the greatest affected being the youth due to high unemployment rates.

The minimum wage policy is aimed at reducing abject poverty and income inequalities in Portugal which will increase demand and lead to economic stability in the long-term. In 2014 after a four-year freeze Portugal increased their minimum wage by 4%. The minimum wage policy which came after negotiations with labor organizations and employers was only possible after substantial recovery of the economy and will increase the sustainability of the economy with aims at reducing poverty.|$|E
25|$|Proposals for a {{university}} in Queensland began in the 1870s. A royal commission in 1874, chaired by Sir Charles Lilley, recommended the immediate establishment of {{a university}}.

Those in favour of the university, {{in the face of}} this opposition, distanced themselves from Oxford and Cambridge and proposed instead a model derived from the mid-western states of the United States. A second royal commission in 1891 recommended the inclusion of five faculties in a new university; arts, law, medicine, science and applied science. Education generally was given a low priority in Queensland's budgets, and in a colony with a literacy rate of 57% in 1861, primary education was the first concern well ahead of secondary and technical education. The government, despite the findings of the royal commissions, was unwilling to commit funds to the establishment of a university.|$|E
