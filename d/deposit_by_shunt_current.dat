40|$|In this {{viewpoint}} article, {{we discuss}} the electric properties of the medium around neurons, which are important to correctly interpret extracellular potentials or electric field effects in neural tissue. We focus on how these electric properties shape the frequency scaling of brain signals at different scales, such as intracellular recordings, the local field potential (LFP), the electroencephalogram (EEG) or the magnetoencephalogram (MEG). These signals display frequency-scaling properties which are not consistent with resistive media. The medium appears to exert a frequency filtering scaling as 1 /√(f), which is the typical frequency scaling of ionic diffusion. Such a scaling was also found recently by impedance measurements in physiological conditions. Ionic diffusion {{appears to be the}} only possible explanation to reconcile these measurements and the frequency-scaling properties found in different brain signals. However, other measurements suggest that the extracellular medium is essentially resistive. To resolve this discrepancy, we show new evidence that metal-electrode measurements can be perturbed <b>by</b> <b>shunt</b> <b>currents</b> going through the surface of the brain. Such a shunt may explain the contradictory measurements, and together with ionic diffusion, provides a framework where all observations can be reconciled.

40|$|Feed-forward {{inhibition}} {{mediated by}} ionotropic GABA A receptors {{contributes to the}} temporal precision of neuronal signal integration.

The relative roles of these mechanisms in neuronal computations are, however, incompletely understood. In this study, we show that by depolarizing the resting membrane potential relative to the reversal potential for GABA A receptors, the hyperpolarization-activated mixed cation current (I h) maintains a voltage gradient for fast synaptic inhibition in hippocampal pyramidal cells. Pharmacological or genetic ablation of I h broadens the depolarizing phase of afferent synaptic waveforms by hyperpolarizing the resting membrane potential.

It is unlikely that felsic magma would have the thermal energy necessary to melt {{its way through the}} thickest aspect of the crust above a subduction zone, without an unidentified heat source. And while mafic magma such as at Kīlauea flows through the much thinner oceanic crust, this has been explained as the outflow from a mantle plume, even though the seamount chain began in a subduction zone that is older that the postulated plume, and which is mutually exclusive with it. Hence subduction volcanoes are the primary riddle. A new heat source is considered: resistive heating from telluric currents. The significance is that {{it might be possible to}} prevent cataclysmic eruptions, such as at Yellowstone, <b>by</b> <b>shunting</b> the <b>current</b> into a new path, using a conductive borehole some distance away from Yellowstone, which would remove the resistive heating and thereby relax the pressure in the existing chamber.

40|$|A circuit for commutating a {{thyristor}} (21) <b>by</b> <b>shunting</b> its <b>current</b> for {{a minimum}} interval, thereby removing sustaining voltage to said thyristor, then subsequently restoring voltage to said thyristor at a predetermined rate, utilizes a series combination of a commutation electronic switch (22) and an isolated dc voltage supply (23) connected in parallel with the thyristor.

40|$|A {{model of}} β-adrenergic and muscarinic {{cholinergic}} {{stimulation of the}} bullfrog atrial myocyte has been developed that mimics the dose-dependent effects of isoprenaline (ISO) on the action potential duration (APD); i. e., low doses of ISO lengthen the APD, while high doses shorten the ADP. This reduction in APD is modeled {{as the result of}} (1) calcium-dependent inactivation of ICa resulting from the enhancement of ICa by ISO and (2) an enhancement of IK due to both an ISO-induced increase in the rate of activation of IK and an increase in peak action potential height. The effect of acetylcholine (ACh) is to reduce the ISO-induced increase in ICa and IK through a reduction in relative (cAMP) as well as to stimulate the ACh-sensitive K+ current IK,ACh. At low (ISO) levels or high (ACh) levels, the muscarinic cholinergic effect dominates over the β-adrenergic effect. However, for a large (ISO) and a small (ACh), this pattern of changes in transmembrane currents is different; in this case the model predicts that ACh can actually increase APD. A distributed parameter model of an idealized bullfrog atrial trabeculum is developed. Individual cardiac cells are resistively coupled end to end via intercalated discs to form an idealized cylindrical cardiac strand encased in a resistive-capacitative trabecular sheath which, in turn, is located in a finite cylindrical volume conductor. A second-order implicit finite numerical integration method is used to calculate the time-varying potentials within the intracellular (Vi), interstitial (Ve), and the outer volume conductor (Vo) media of the concentric cylindrical structure. 'Reduced' cell membrane models which lack the complete complement of transmembrane currents are compared with regard to their accuracy in representing the foot, upstroke, and plateau regions of the propagated action potential in the complete model. A reduced cell membrane model should contain the sodium current INa, the calcium current ICa and the background rectifying K+ current IK 1. A cell membrane model which contains a linear background K+ current IL instead of IK 1 produces a poor approximation to the upstroke, plateau and conduction velocity of an action potential. The trabecular sheath reduces the extracellular resistance seen by the cell <b>by</b> <b>shunting</b> <b>current</b> away from highly resistive interstitial medium into the volume conductor medium which is of low resistance, and thereby increases conduction velocity. Finally, the effects of the cholinergic neurotransmitter, acetylcholine (ACh), on both the passive and active properties of the trabeculum are investigated. The addition of ACh to the extracellular medium reduces the space constant and input resistance of the trabeculum, as well as the conduction velocity of electrical activity propagating through it...|$|R

40|$|The {{main body}} of work in this thesis is a proof of concept study for the first {{quantitative}} analysis of local shunts and recombinationactive defects in silicon solar cells, using photoluminescence (PL) imaging. A small study for a practical application of the fast shunt detection capabilities of PL imaging is demonstrated. PL images and an improved shunt isolation process are used to identify and isolate shunted regions in twenty multicrystalline commercial solar cells rejected due to a low shunt resistance. The performance of eight of these cells was recovered to acceptable industry standards. The method developed in this thesis, for quantitative analysis of the shunt resistance, is based on interpretation of the luminescence intensity around a local shunt or recombination-active defect {{in terms of the}} extracted current. The theoretical relationship between the photoluminescence signal and the <b>shunt</b> <b>current</b> is derived. Experimental results on specifically prepared test structures show good agreement with known values. The best results show that if a PL image of the sample is available before and after <b>shunting,</b> the <b>shunt</b> <b>current</b> can be calculated to within ± 6. 8 %. If only a shunted PL image is available, the <b>shunt</b> <b>current</b> can be calculated to within ± 13. 4 %, provided that the shunt is located in a region of uniform PL signal. These results are based on the specific sample set in this thesis; for a more widely applicable error, a much larger and varied sample set would need to be analysed. The method is applied to wafers at various processing stages. PL imaging is found to be a more convenient method for quantitative characterisation of wafers than ILIT. A method for contactlessly distinguishing between ohmic and non-ohmic shunts is proposed and investigated. The effect of the front metallisation on the interpretation of shunts in PL images is found to introduce an error of at least 50 % in the calculated <b>shunt</b> <b>current.</b> It is concluded that the work in this thesis has successfully extended the characterisation capabilities of PL imaging to include quantitative evaluation of local <b>shunt</b> <b>currents...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{inferior}} olivary nucleus (IO) {{forms the}} gateway to the cerebellar cortex and receives feedback information from the cerebellar nuclei (CN), thereby occupying a central position in the olivo-cerebellar loop. Here, we investigated the feedback input from the CN to the IO in vivo in mice using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. This approach allows us to study how the CN-feedback input is integrated with the activity of olivary neurons, while the olivo-cerebellar system and its connections are intact. Our results show how IO neurons respond to CN stimulation sequentially with: i) a short depolarization (EPSP), ii) a hyperpolarization (IPSP) and iii) a rebound depolarization. The latter two phenomena can also be evoked without the EPSPs. The IPSP is sensitive to a GABA(A) receptor blocker. The IPSP suppresses suprathreshold and subthreshold activity and is generated mainly by activation of the GABA(A) receptors. The rebound depolarization re-initiates and temporarily phase locks the subthreshold oscillations. Lack of electrotonical coupling {{does not affect the}} IPSP of individual olivary neurons, nor the sensitivity of its GABA(A) receptors to blockers. The GABAergic feedback input from the CN does not only temporarily block the transmission of signals through the IO, it also isolates neurons from the network <b>by</b> <b>shunting</b> the junction <b>current</b> and re-initiates the temporal pattern after a fixed time point.
