5|$|The Blackdowns {{are on the}} {{south-west}} {{border of}} Somerset, extending into Devon. They are composed of Upper Greensand. The scarp faces north and is steep and wooded, with a south facing <b>dip</b> <b>slope.</b> There is an open plateau, which is {{not as high as}} the Mendips.|$|E
5|$|Classic {{examples}} are {{found at the}} Banff townsite proper: Mount Rundle is a classic <b>dip</b> <b>slope</b> mountain. Just {{to the north of}} the Banff townsite, Castle Mountain is composed of numerous Cambrian age rock formations. The uppermost section of the peak consists of relatively harder dolomite from the Eldon Formation. Below that lies the less dense shales of the Stephen Formation and the lowest exposed cliffs are limestones of the Cathedral Formation. Dogtooth mountains, such as Mount Louis, exhibit sharp, jagged slopes. The Sawback Range, which consists of nearly vertical dipping sedimentary layers, has been eroded by cross gullies. The erosion of these almost vertical layers of rock strata in the Sawback Range has resulted in formations that appear like the teeth on a saw blade. Erosion and deposition of higher elevation rock layers has resulted in scree deposits at the lowest elevations of many of the mountains.|$|E
5|$|The Quantock Hills {{are largely}} formed by rocks of the Devonian Period, which consist of sediments {{originally}} laid down under a shallow sea and slowly compressed into solid rock. In the higher north western areas older Early Devonian rocks, known as Hangman Grits, predominate, {{and can be}} seen in the exposed rock at West Quantoxhead quarry, which were worked for road building. Further south there are newer Middle and Late Devonian rocks, known as Ilfracombe beds and Morte Slates. These include sandstone and limestone, which have been quarried near Aisholt. At Great Holwell, south of Aisholt, there is a limestone cave, which is the only one in the Devonian limestone of North Devon and West Somerset. The lower fringes around the hills are composed of younger rocks of the Triassic period, these are known as New Red Sandstone rocks which represent the deposits of large river systems that crossed a desert plain, and often contain irregular masses or veins of gypsum, which was worked on the foreshore at Watchet. The scarp is to the west with a <b>dip</b> <b>slope</b> to the east. The west side is cut by combes with broad valleys on the east. The hill tops are open heathland with woods on the slopes.|$|E

25|$|Mount Dorst, to the east, {{is part of}} the <b>dip</b> <b>slope</b> of {{the ancestral}} Pinatubo. Several {{mountains}} near modern Pinatubo are old satellite vents of ancestral Pinatubo, forming volcanic plugs and lava domes. These satellite vents were probably active around {{the same time as the}} ancestral volcano and include the domes of Mount Negron, Mount Cuadrado, Mount Mataba and the Bituin and Tapungho plugs.|$|E
25|$|The {{location}} of Gravesend is {{at a point}} where the higher land – the lowest point of the <b>dip</b> <b>slope</b> of the North Downs – reaches the river bank. To the east are the low-lying Shorne Marshes; to the west, beyond Northfleet and the Swanscombe Marshes. The settlement thus established because it was a good landing place: it was also sheltered by the prominent height of what is now called Windmill Hill (see Landmarks below); although Windmill Hill still remains a dominant feature, Gravesend's highest point is actually further inland at Marling Cross, adjacent to the A2.|$|E
25|$|The {{vigorous}} {{campaign of}} mine warfare waged by the French and Germans was continued by the British, exploiting {{the advantage of}} being on the <b>dip</b> <b>slope</b> and only having to dig horizontally into the ridge to undermine German positions. The Germans, on the steeper scarp slope, had to dig down before they could dig horizontally, which added to the German disadvantage in manpower and mining equipment. An attack was planned by the Germans to capture the British positions from which mine galleries were being dug under the German defences. Success would gain more defensive depth and forestall mine attacks on the German positions before the British had been able to organise their defences on the ridge.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Uncertainty is {{inherent}} in geotechnical design. In regard to estimating the stability state of <b>dip</b> <b>slopes,</b> most of the uncertainty lies in the geologic model assumed and the geotechnical parameters used in the evaluation. Biplanar (or active–passive) sliding in <b>dip</b> <b>slopes</b> occurs along a slope-parallel sliding surface with toe breakout occurring {{at the base of}} the failure. Internal shearing is required to facilitate kinematic release. All three of these release surfaces work together for the slope to fail, but with different degrees of importance depending on the dip-slope inclination. Increased efficiency and value with respect to the site investigation resources can be gained by working toward minimizing the uncertainty of those parameters that have the greatest bearing on the outcome of the slope stability analysis. This can be done quickly and inexpensively by performing scoping calculations facilitated by the use of Spearman rank correlation coefficients. This paper demonstrates that for shallow-dipping <b>dip</b> <b>slopes,</b> stability is primarily dictated by the shear strength of the slope-parallel sliding surface, and therefore, efforts should be focused on constraining the shear strength of this surface. For steep <b>dip</b> <b>slopes,</b> the shear strength related to the toe breakout and internal shear release surfaces becomes dominant, and therefore, the rock-mass shear strength and that for any adversely dipping persistent discontinuities should be the focus of the geotechnical investigation.

500|$|The Canadian Rockies {{may have}} towered up to [...] {{approximately}} 70m.y.a. Once mountain formation ceased, erosion from water and greatly augmented later from glacier ice {{beginning with the}} Quaternary glaciation 2.5 m.y.a. carved the mountains into their present shapes. Glacial landforms dominate Banff's geomorphology, with examples of all classic glacial forms, including cirques, arêtes, hanging valleys, moraines, and U-shaped valleys. The pre-existing structure left over from mountain-building strongly guided glacial erosion: mountains in Banff include complex, irregular, anticlinal, synclinal, castellate, dogtooth, and sawback mountains. Many of the mountain ranges trend northwest to southeast, with sedimentary layering dipping down to the west at 40–60 degrees. This leads to <b>dip</b> <b>slope</b> landforms, with generally steeper east and north faces, and trellis drainage, where rivers and old glacial valleys followed the weaker layers in the rocks as they were relatively easily weathered and eroded.|$|E

50|$|The Magaliesberg Range has a {{very long}} {{geological}} history. Its quartzites, shales, chert and dolomite were deposited as sediments in an inland basin {{on top of the}} 3 billion year old Archaean Basement Complex. This process of sedimentation lasted for about 300 million years. About 2 billion years ago a massive upwelling of molten magma resulted in what is now known as the Bushveld Igneous Complex. The enormous weight of this intrusion depressed the sediments that lay beneath and tilted the sediments along the edges so that the broken scarps faced outward and upward, and the gentler <b>dip</b> <b>slopes</b> inward. During the same period these sediments were fractured and igneous intrusions of dolerite filled the cracks. With the passage of time these intrusions eroded, especially on the <b>dip</b> <b>slopes,</b> forming deep kloofs or ravines providing excellent rock-climbing potential to modern man. This large dog-leg-shaped area is now termed the Transvaal Basin and includes the lofty escarpment of the Transvaal Drakensberg overlooking the Lowveld {{in the eastern part of}} the country. Massive outpourings of igneous material - volcanic lava - of the much younger Karoo Supergroup later covered the Transvaal Basin, but this was subsequently eroded so that it only remains along the Transvaal Basin's southern rim.|$|R

40|$|Abandonment {{of forest}} {{plantations}} after clear-cutting {{has increased in}} the southern part of Kyushu, SW Japan. This abandonment of forests after clear-cutting hinders sustainable forest management and recovery of forest resources, and poses a periodic threat to soil and water resources. We investigated the current status of slope failures in and around a large-scale abandoned forest (95. 6 ha) after clear-cutting, located near Kumamura Village, southern Kumamoto Prefecture. Dominant geology in the investigated area is alternating beds of sandstone and mudstone, dipping to the northwest, within the Shimanto Belt (an accretionary prism). Geologic characteristics affect the distribution of slope failures in this region. We divided the slope failures into three types: shallow road-cut failures on NW-N facing <b>dip</b> <b>slopes</b> along harvesting roads, slumps in road prism and fill, and deep-seated landslides on SE-S facing opposite <b>dip</b> <b>slopes</b> along the Butsuzo tectonic line (the boundary between the Chichibu and Shimanto terrains). Although slope failures along harvesting roads are affected by geologic characteristics, they are primarily related to inadequate road construction. In contrast, deep-seated landslides along the Butsuzo tectonic line are predominantly influenced by geologic structure in this region, independent of logging and road construction. This study provides a rough guide for planning the design and construction standards of forestry related roads and associated drainage systems to minimize landslide hazards...|$|R
