Breach of contract has been analyzed as a problem in how to use damage remedies as prices which will encourage economically efficient behavior by the breaching party. <b>Discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract,</b> in contrast, has been analyzed as {{a question of whether}} or not to excuse the non-performing party without imposing any penalty at all, with the answer often depending on which party is the superior risk bearer.

40|$|The topic <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> by breach <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> {{constitutes}} one <b>of</b> the thorniest {{areas of}} the common law <b>of</b> <b>contract.</b> This paper is a wide-ranging one and adopts a comparative approach. It first explores {{the nature of a}} breach <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> (as contrasted, for example, to <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> a <b>contract</b> by frustration) before proceeding to consider the relevant historical origins which might provide some clues as to why we now have different approaches in ascertaining whether or not the innocent party can elect to treat itself as discharged from a contract {{as a result of a}} breach by the other party of one or more of the terms <b>of</b> that <b>contract</b> (focusing on the “condition-warranty approach” and “Hongkong Fir approach”). The paper then proceeds to analyse the aforementioned approaches on doctrinal, theoretical as well as practical levels. Finally, it explores more specific aspects of the topic (including the legal effect of a breach <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> committed by both parties; whether termination <b>of</b> a <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> employment is “elective” or “automatic” (focusing on the UK Supreme Court decision of Geys v Société Générale, London Branch); as well as the breach of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence) ...|$|R

40|$|S u m m a r y The goal of {{this thesis}} is to analyse the legal {{consequences}} of the breach of contract, especially under civil law, although, some essential comparison with legal regulation of commercial law is given, too. The text is divided into ten chapters. In the introduction, i. e. {{in the first two}} chapters the term of contract is defined and then the basic legal principles of the contractual law are enumerated and described in respect of the topic. The third chapter deals with the subject of the paper globally and shortly characterises each consequence of the breach of contract. The account of them is also given. The following chapters provide complete information how every consequence works and which part it plays in the Czech legal system. Specifically, Chapter Four is focused on debtor's delay and Chapter Five on creditor's delay. Chapter Six investigates liability for damage and damages a bit, as well. Chapter Seven deals with liability for defects and Chapter Eight is about contractual fine. In Chapter Nine is mentioned <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> and its consequences. Each of in this paragraph enumerated chapters describes its subject itself and also relevant related problems in context with practice of the courts. In the last chapter, i. e. in the Conclusion is the whole topic shortly summarized with [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Unlike the French Civil code, the German Civil code {{belongs to}} the group of {{so-called}} anti-causalistic codifications, since it explicitly does not govern the issue of purpose (cause) of contract. Due to this very reason, the delineation between abstract and causal juridical acts gains special importance in German law. The German Civil Code governs a number of juridical acts and other acts of legal importance that are abstract in their nature. Among them the abstract nature of the promise to fulfill an obligation (Schuldversprechung) and the acknowledgement of a debt (Schuldannerkennung) is traditionally considered the most prominent. However, the relation to the purpose for which they are concluded is not entirely interrupted, since in the case of frustration of their purpose, any asset given to the other party is subject to restitution under the rules of unjustified enrichment. The fact that the issue of purpose of contract is not explicitly governed in the German Civil Code, does not lead to the conclusion, though, that it is legally irrelevant. It gains legal relevance in two different aspects: as a licit and as an illicit purpose. On the one hand, juridical acts concluded with the aim to achieve illicit purposes are considered void, for which the Code's sections on the general confines of the principle of freedom of contract serve the statutory basis - such juridical acts infringe the institution of 'good customs' (gute Sitten), usually referred to as public policy, while the performance of other factual or legal acts in order to achieve illicit purposes are sanctioned under the rules of unjustified enrichment. On the other hand, lawful purposes of the parties gain legal relevance in relation to a range of various institutions. Concerning some of them the Code itself contains formulations implying the necessity to ascertain the purpose of contract, while in other cases the case law and the doctrine have come to such conclusion. The determination of the purpose of contract in the context of these institutions either secures the fulfilment of the purpose of assumption of contractual obligation of one of the parties or rectifies the consequences of the frustration of the fulfilment of that purpose. In this range surely the most important institutions are the collapse of the basis of transac tion or frustration of purpose (Störung der Geschäftsgrundlage), a special case of <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> due to impossibility, whereby the purpose of contract is realized without the performance of debtor's obligation, a special case of unjustified enrichment due to frustration of the result aimed by the purpose of the transaction and the invalidity of standard business terms that jeopardize the fulfillment of the purpose of contract...|$|E
40|$|With {{passage of}} a 1987 statute, Montana became the only state to adopt a “good cause” {{standard}} for <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> employees with <b>contracts</b> <b>of</b> unspecified duration. The new statute was a legislative response {{to a series of}} Montana Supreme Court cases, starting in 1980, that gave otherwise at-will employees a broad right to sue for wrongful discharge. Estimating a policy intervention model using monthly time-series data on Montana employment, the authors find that the seminal Montana wrongful discharge case reduced annual employment growth in Montana by 0. 46 percentage points, and that the “good cause” statute restored the original growth rate. While the firing costs literature would suggest that employment should fall following implementation <b>of</b> a heightened <b>discharge</b> standard, the contrary result in Montana is likely due to important procedural and other limitations imposed by the new statute on discharged employees’ legal recourse...|$|R

6000|$|A {{rigorous}} winter {{had much}} to do with the actual distresses of the army, but the root of the evil lay in the derangement of the currency. Congress had commenced the war without adequate funds, and without the power of imposing direct taxes. To meet pressing emergencies, it had emitted paper money, which, for a time, passed currently at par; but sank in value as further emissions succeeded, and that already in circulation remained unredeemed. The several States added to the evil by emitting paper in their separate capacities: thus the country gradually became flooded with a [...] "continental currency," [...] as it was called; irredeemable, and of no intrinsic value. The consequence was a general derangement of trade and finance. The continental currency declined to such a degree, that forty dollars in paper were equivalent to only one in specie. Congress attempted to put a stop to this depreciation, by making paper money a legal tender, at its nominal value, in the <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> debts, however <b>contracted.</b> This opened the door to knavery, and added a new feature to the evil.|$|R

40|$|Within our commercialised market society, {{contractual}} relationships are objectified and valued in monetary terms. This {{raises the question}} of the transferability <b>of</b> <b>contracts.</b> Transfer <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> implies a substitution of one the existing contractual parties. It intends the transfer of the entire contractual position of the transferor to a third party, as a result of which the latter would fully replace the transferor, who is completely discharged from the contractual relationship. An important advantage is that the transfer <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> upholds the identity of the contractual relationship and thus maintains that relationship with all its securities and defences. The term <b>of</b> the <b>contract</b> and any prescription which has commenced, will continue to run and the contract will in principle be governed by the law as applied {{at the time of its}} conclusion. In Belgian and French law a general theory <b>of</b> transfer <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> is lacking. Not only the possibility of a full substitution of a contractual party, but also the requirements for the conclusion of the transfer <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> and its consequences are highly debated. Moreover, the distinction between a transfer <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> and a transfer of contractual rights/debts is unclear. The research therefore envisages to develop a general legal regime for the transfer <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> ut singuli. The first part of the research is a conceptual analysis of the possibility of a transfer <b>of</b> <b>contract.</b> It focuses on the concept of contractual relationship/contractual position as distinct from the concept of contractual right or contractual debt/ obligation. Subsequently, the transfer <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> is considered as a (subjective) modification of the contractual relationship.

40|$|Congestion {{management}} {{is one of}} the most important issues for secure and reliable system operations in deregulated electricity market. In the competitive electricity market, it is not always possible to <b>discharge</b> all <b>of</b> the <b>contracted</b> power transactions due to congestion in the transmission lines. In most cases, Independent System Operator tries to remove congestion by rescheduling output power of the generators. This paper presents an optimal allocation method for flexible ac transmission system (FACTS) devices for market-based power systems considering congestion relief and voltage stability. In this paper, transmission congestion distribution factors based on sensitivity of line real power has been proposed to identify the congestion clusters. The system operator can identify the generators from the most sensitive congestion clusters to reschedule their generation optimally to manage transmission congestion based on generator sensitivity efficiently. The role of Thyristor controlled series Capacitor and Static Var Compensator have been investigated for reducing the transmission congestion cost ensuring voltage stability after locating it optimally in the system based on improved performance index.

While it acknowledges the fact that Ghana’s democracy has shown some level of resilience {{in the face of}} some collateral difficulties since 1993 when the country returned to democracy which has been sustained so far, it contends that bad governance, which is manifested mostly in widespread corruption in public institutions and the political leadership challenges exhibited by all political leaders since the inception of the country’s fourth republic, pose a significant threat to the country’s democracy if not effectively addressed. It argues that in the face of difficult national issues creating resentment and despair such as erratic electricity power supply, lack of potable water for many communities, high unemployment rates, poor but expensive health delivery system, unaffordable but low quality educational facilities at all levels of education, high maternal death rates, poor infrastructure, weak industrial sector, higher interest rates and unsustainable agricultural sector performance, among others, the continued existence and manifestation of these evils to national development present precarious and very dire implications for the country’s democracy.

40|$|The federal {{bankruptcy}} system {{strikes a}} balance between the rights of debtors seeking a fresh start and the rights of creditors seeking repayment for debt. While many areas of the Bankruptcy Code provide examples of this balancing act, perhaps no area of the Code embodies this balance better than <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> debt. <b>Discharge</b> <b>of</b> debt provides the fresh start for debtors on which the bankruptcy system rests, but the Code also protects the interests of creditors who would otherwise have their claims against the debtor discharged. Section 523 (a) (6) excepts from discharge any debt for willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity or to the property of another entity.  Clearly, this section prohibits discharge for debts that result from a bad act of the debtor, and serves a punitive function by not allowing a debtor to use the bankruptcy system to avoid debts when the debtor acted wrongfully in incurring those debts. While the Supreme Court has had the opportunity to consider the definition of willful and malicious injury, it has done so only {{in the context of a}} tort claim, leaving courts to determine the applicability of § 523 (a) (6) in the context <b>of</b> breach <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> claims. This article merges traditional tort doctrine regarding levels of intent to harm, traditional <b>contract</b> doctrine <b>of</b> efficient breach, and modern developments recognizing punitive damages in contract actions to conclude that § 523 (a) (6) should permit nondischargeability of intentional breaches <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> that lack business justification...|$|R

40|$|Mathematical {{simulation}} {{and laboratory}} experiments {{were conducted to}} investigate the controlling factor for aerobic sludge granulation. A model was {{used to describe the}} biomass dynamics during the granulation process. The simulation results indicate that the selective <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> small and loose sludge flocs is the key controlling factor for granulation. In the experimental studies, tests were conducted with four batch column reactors (BCR) that were seeded with both activated sludge flocs and mature granules. Three different sludge discharge methods were tested, including unselective <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> mixed sludge, selective <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> small and slow-settling flocs, and selective <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> settled dense sludge. The results show that mixed sludge <b>discharge</b> and <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> dense sludge resulted in disappearance of granules from the reactors. Only selective <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> small and slow-settling sludge flocs led to complete granulation. Small and loose sludge flocs were found to have a clear advantage over large and dense granules in substrate uptake. It can be concluded that selective <b>discharge</b> <b>of</b> loose flocs removes these competitors in suspended-growth mode from the reactors and makes the substrate more available for uptake and utilization by the biomass in attached-growth form, leading to granulation. © IWA Publishing 2010. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
