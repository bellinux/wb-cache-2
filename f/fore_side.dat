Seconds after the initial blast, the number two 15-inch turret was blown over the side by a massive explosion, this time from the detonation of that turret's magazines.|$|R

50|$|Almost {{no sexual}} {{dimorphism}} occurs in this species, although males have more curved dorsal fins with broader bases and greater surface areas. The {{back of the}} dolphin is dark grey or black, and the dorsal fin is distinctively two-toned; the leading edge matches the back in colour, but the trailing edge is a much lighter greyish white. The dusky dolphins has a long, light-grey patch on its <b>fore</b> <b>side</b> leading to a short, dark-grey beak. The throat and belly are white, and the beak and lower jaw are dark grey. Two blazes of white colour run back on the body from the dorsal fin to the tail. Right between the white areas remains a characteristic thorn-shaped patch of dark colour, by which the species can easily be recognised. Aside from that, dusky dolphins may be confused {{with other members of}} their genus when observed at sea.It can be distinguished from the common dolphin, which has a more prominent and longer beak and yellow flank markings. The skull of a dusky dolphin has a longer and narrower rostrum than that of an hourglass dolphin or Peale's dolphin of similar age and size.|$|E

50|$|The {{aircraft}} was powered by eight Liberty L-12 V12 engines {{built in the}} United States. Capable of producing 400 hp (294 kW) each, {{they were the most}} powerful engines produced during the First World War. They were arranged in two sets of four: one close to the foremost wing set (two engines were pulling and had a two-blade propeller, while the other two were located in a push-pull nacelle and had four-blade propellers) and one close to the aftmost wing set (two engines were pushing and had a two-blade propeller, while the other two were located in a push-pull nacelle and had four-blade propellers). All four side engines and both nacelles were surmounted by radiators for the cooling liquid. The two nacelles also housed a cockpit for one flight engineer each, who controlled the power output of the engines in response to the orders given by the pilots by means of a complex system of lights and indicators located on electrical panels. Each of the two <b>fore</b> <b>side</b> engines was connected to the central wing set and to the corresponding aft engine thanks to a truss boom with a triangular section.|$|E
40|$|In August 2008, {{specimens}} of the Homalopteridae were colleted from Tibet. They were sorted and identified as Balitora pengi Huang. The {{discovery of the}} species represents the first record of the Homalopteridae and its type species B. pengi in Tibet. We herein redescribe and illustrate the species. The specie is characterized by having longer length of body, <b>fore</b> <b>side</b> depressed, tail compressed; rostral part rounded; mouth inferior, moderate large, arch-shaped, the lower lip thin; eye small; rostral groove and fold exist; dorsal short, its origin obviously behind that of ventral,nearer tip of snout than caudal-base; 1 pair of mouth barbels; rostral fold divided into 3 parts, between them with 2 pairs of rostral barbels; base of paired fin without robust fleshy fin peduncle; ventral fins separated each other, not connected to fucker form; anus near anal fin origin, not covered by ventral fin; caudal fork shallow, caudal length as long as head length; lateral line through body. The specimens studied are deposited in the School of Life Science, Southwest University, Chongqing, china. It is known that Homalopteridae fishes distribute in the the provinces, Yunnan province e. g., south of Yangtze River. And B. pengi mainly distribute in Liusha River, the tributary of Lancang River.

40|$|We have {{reported}} here a specific human short stature population in Kedurang District, South Bengkulu. AH those are men, {{described as a}} mild dwarf (130 - 150 cm), detected after 5 to 10 years old, caused by the failure on lumbar backbone growth and development, and only found among the men. In this investigation, we examine the inheritance pattern of the dwarfism by using pedigree analysis, study the morphological comparison between the disorder and normal person, and finally we ascertain the variation among the disorder. We accomplished a survey on pedigree family to at least 3 - 4 generations related to the disorder. The data are then tested with Chi-square test, and transformed to tree families and pedigree analysis. To investigate morphological performance and their variation, we collected morphometric measurements to both disorder and normal group of sample; they are the height, the vertebral bones length, head measurement, the leg and arm length (upper and <b>fore</b> <b>side),</b> and their indexes. The data were analyzed descriptively. To find out the variation, the quantitative expression and penetrance, we evaluated the data according to normal distribution with Z test. The result showed all the dwarfisms in Kedurang are men, who inherited his gene from his carrier mother. As a result, the gene has tightly linked to X chromosome and supposedly belongs to Spondylo Epiphypeseal Dysplasia Tarda (SEDT). These were concluded from 32 related family of dwarfism. We found 19 dwarf persons, grouped into young, adult, and older persons. The their height were shorter than normal (136, 5 cm), {{and the length of}} vertebrae was under normal value (51, 5 cm). Their frontal extremity were shorter than the normal one, but they are in proportion with any part comprised them. Their feet were shorter, but the proportion of leg is longer than calf. The rest is as normally. Among the dwarf person, there are variations of the length. The phenotypic expressivity is varied in the vertebrae, leg, and calf; but the rest is relatively invariable. Their penetrance is strong, mostly in the height, length of vertebrae, and legs. Based on morphological data we concluded that the disorder in the Kedurang, South Bengkulu belongs to SEDT (Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia tardd) ...|$|E

50|$|The Hovercraft Development team quickly {{picked up}} on the LIM concept as well. Their initial {{solution}} was a track shaped like an upside-down T, with the vertical portion consisting of a central concrete section with aluminium stator plates fixed on either side.

Four pads provided lift, arranged two on a <b>side</b> <b>fore</b> and aft and riding on the horizontal surface of the guideway. Four more pads, above the lift pads, were rotated vertically to press against the centre beam and kept the craft centred.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of a portfolio of musical compositions and a written commentary. The submitted works creatively challenge {{the form of a}} conventional concert by exploring methods of bringing to the <b>fore</b> the theatrical <b>side</b> of musical performance: its inherited or implemented conceptual and visual aspects. The portfolio is divided into three main categories. The first comprises a series of pieces that balance between music theatre and conventional concert practices. The second category includes works that reform many aspects of the traditional concert presentation, without breaking away from it. The third category includes works that experiment within the territory determined by the previous categories. The written commentary presents theoretically the compositional approach used throughout the portfolio and provides a brief philosophical background, such as is necessary to explain the underlying concepts, ideas, preoccupations and concerns. It also contains a comprehensive analysis of the submitted works, their aims, contextual links, applied methodologies, associations with other composers’ works and interconnections between them.
