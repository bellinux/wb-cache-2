40|$|<b>Frontloading</b> is a {{decision}} to move a primary date to the beginning (“front”) of the presidential nomination season. 1 State party leaders have moved their primary dates to the front so that their partisans may have more influence in the selection process. Over time, more and more primaries have been moved to the front (“loaded”), creating nomination seasons {{with more and more}} delegates awarded in multi-state (“Super Tuesday”) primaries. A consequence of <b>frontloading</b> is a front-loaded nomination season. This paper reviews empirical evidence that relates to a variety of concerns about <b>frontloading.</b> It first describes the rise and underlying political dynamics of <b>frontloading,</b> and then considers the effect of <b>frontloading</b> on the outcome of nomination contests. Critics prefer a “back-loaded ” process that would last longer. A longer race, if competitive, could provide candidates more opportunities to espouse their policy positions, journalists more opportunities to cover the issues, and citizens more opportunities to learn the candidates ’ issue positions. Citizens residing in states at the “back ” would have a more compelling reason to vote. To what extent do studies of back-loaded and front-loaded contests support these alleged effects? Does <b>frontloading</b> matter to citizens who vote in presidential primaries? What motivates state party leaders to move their delegate-selection activities to the front...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{performance}} of <b>frontloading</b> and the standard WHO method for diagnosis of pulmonary TB at Mulago Hospital in order to validate the technique in this setting. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study in which 229 adult ($ 18 years) TB suspects were consecutively enrolled. Suspects submitted three sputum samples as follows: at initial presentation, one hour after the first sample, and the next morning. The first and next morning samples formed the standard WHO method, while {{the first and the}} one hour later samples formed the <b>frontloading</b> method. Sample processing was by the standard N-acetyl L-cystein (NALC) -NaOH method, and fluorescent microscopy was done for both methods, while cultures of the first sample on Lowenstein-Jensen slants acted as a gold standard. The sensitivity, specificity and predictive values for the WHO standard and <b>frontloading</b> methods were compared. Results: The sensitivity of both the <b>frontloading</b> and standard schemes was 91. 1 % while their specificities were 86. 2 % and 91. 7 % respectively. There was excellent agreement between the diagnostic capacity of the two methods (kappa statistic = 0. 87, P, 0. 0001).

40|$|Fluid force {{microscopy}} {{combines the}} positional accuracy and force sensitivity of an {{atomic force microscope}} (AFM) with nanofluidics via a microchanneled cantilever. However, adequate loading and cleaning procedures for such AFM micropipettes are required for various application situations. Here, a new <b>frontloading</b> procedure is described for an AFM micropipette functioning as a force- and pressure-controlled microscale liquid dispenser. This <b>frontloading</b> procedure seems especially attractive when using target substances featuring high costs or low available amounts. Here, the AFM micropipette could be filled from the tip side with liquid from a previously applied droplet with a volume {{of only a few}} μL using a short low-pressure pulse. The liquid-loaded AFM micropipettes could be then applied for experiments in air or liquid environments. AFM micropipette <b>frontloading</b> was evaluated with the well-known organic fluorescent dye rhodamine 6 G and the AlexaFluor 647 -labeled antibody goat anti-rat IgG {{as an example of a}} larger biological compound. After micropipette usage, specific cleaning procedures were tested. Furthermore, a storage method is described, at which the AFM micropipettes could be stored for a few hours up to several days without drying out or clogging of the microchannel. In summary, the rapid, versatile and cost-efficient <b>frontloading</b> and cleaning procedure for the repeated usage of a single AFM micropipette is beneficial for various application situations from specific surface modifications through to local manipulation of living cells, and provides a simplified and faster handling for already known experiments with fluid force microscopy...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The extant {{presidential campaigns}} and {{elections}} literature has {{done much to}} point out the presence of <b>frontloading</b> across presidential nomination cycles, but has ultimately failed to sufficiently explain why it is that states have decided to move their primaries to earlier dates. Carman and Barker (2005) shifted the focus of the literature {{in the direction of the}} states themselves; looking at the influence of political culture on the decision to frontload. The focus here is on the states as well, with particular attention paid to the actual <b>frontloading</b> decision makers; the state legislatures, governors, state parties and secretaries of state. The decisions of these bodies or individuals from 1976 - 1996 to move their presidential nominating events to earlier dates or keep them in place are the basis for the dependent variable. The focus of the research then shifts to an analysis of the relationship between the decision to frontload and factors such as campaign spending, media coverage, voter turnout and type of delegate selection event. Ultimately, it is found that both the type of decision maker and mode of delegate selection used have a significant effect on a state's ability to move its nominating contest. 1 The <b>frontloading</b> of presidential nominating contests took on a decidedly chaotic tone fo...|$|E

The idea was that these states [...] Nevada from the West and South Carolina from the South [...] would enhance participation by more diverse populations (Latinos and African Americans). While the Republican rules called for states to lose half of their delegate vote if they violated the timing rules, the Democrats implemented a 2 ̆ 2 death penalty 2 ̆ 2 requiring any state violating the timing rules to lose all of its delegates.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} how research and development (R&D) collaboration takes place for complex new products in the automotive sector. The research aims to give guidelines to increase the effectiveness of such collaborations. Design/methodology/approach – The methodology used to investigate this issue was grounded theory. The empirical data were collected through a mixture of interviews and questionnaires. The resulting inducted conceptual models were subsequently validated in industrial workshops. Findings – The findings show that <b>frontloading</b> of the collaborative members was a major issue in managing successful R&D collaborations. Research limitations/implications – The limitation of this research is that it is only based in the German automotive industry. Practical implications – Practical implications have come out of this research. Models and guidelines are given to help make a success of collaborative projects and their potential impacts on time, cost and quality metrics. Originality/value – <b>Frontloading</b> is not often studied in a collaborative manner; it is normally studied within just one organisation.

40|$|How can the {{international}} community save more children’s lives faster and more effectively in the 21 st century? This Working Paper analyzes {{the extent to which}} “frontloading” and predictable vaccine funding, as proposed by the International Finance Facility for Immunization (IFFIm), is more effective in impacting vaccine coverage than spending vaccine funds equally throughout the lives of projects. The IFFIm is an initiative of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), and supported by the governments of the United Kingdom, France, Sweden, Italy, Spain and Norway. An initial IFFIm investment of $ 4 billion is expected to prevent 5 million child deaths by 2015, and more than 5 million future adult deaths. Using a stylized model, the authors quantify the positive and negative effects of predictable vaccine funds and <b>frontloading,</b> and finds IFFIm’s approach can increase the impact of vaccine coverage by 22 %. This is because stable and long-term financing allows vaccine manufacturers and countries to plan for long periods of time, knowing that resources will be available. Front-loading helps to reduce the spread of disease and to immunize large groups of people faster. <b>frontloading,</b> vaccine, immunization...|$|E
