30|$|To our knowledge, <b>TA</b> <b>has</b> {{not been}} tested as a {{bacterial}} inhibitor with ECMO cannulas. The complete capacity of TA to prevent bacterial migration in this in vitro study has significant {{potential in the}} clinical setting. When used to seal the ECMO cannula insertion site, TA effects may reduce extraluminal contamination via a bactericidal effect or a physical barrier effect on bacterial translocation at the skin puncture [29]. Therefore, <b>TA</b> <b>has</b> the potential to reduce localised and bloodstream infection in ECMO, and subsequently may decrease ICU stays, hospital stays and healthcare costs.|$|R

40|$|SummarySome prednisone-resistant asthma {{patients}} {{respond to}} intramuscular triamcinolone acetonide (TA). The use of <b>TA</b> <b>has</b> been questioned {{on the basis}} of its potential toxicity. TA's ratio of clinical efficacy to systemic effects compared with oral prednisone has not been clearly defined. We report the case of a prednisone-insensitive severe asthma patient with insulin-dependent diabetes, hypertension and diabetic retinopathy treated with repeated sessions of laser therapy. By daily monitoring the needs of insulin doses we compared the systemic effects of prednisone and TA. The analysis of the balance between systemic effects (insulin doses) and beneficial effects (PEF values) show that <b>TA</b> <b>has</b> a better benefit/risk profile than prednisone. The patient has been followed up for 3 years and has received injections of TA repeated at intervals ranging from 21 to 60 days according to patient response and the evolution of PEF and clinical symptoms. During this period the patient lost 3 kg of weight, while presenting increased bone mineral density, normalized arterial tension, and improved proliferative diabetic retinopathy. The present case report shows that <b>TA</b> <b>has</b> a better benefit/risk profile than prednisone. TA can be a valuable alternative in the control of some patients with severe prednisone-resistant asthma...|$|R

50|$|Since the BMT was not {{amenable}} to the neat IND system, the <b>TA</b> <b>had</b> {{to make some}} compromises. They tried to follow the IND system of single-letter expresses and double-letter locals, but the system began to break down under the complex BMT routings. Where on the IND a local simply doubled the express letter (A Eighth Avenue Express, AA Eighth Avenue Local), some lines had multiple local services with different routings. For instance the two Brighton Local services, one via the Manhattan Bridge and the other via the Montague Street Tunnel, were designated QB and QT respectively. The <b>TA</b> <b>had</b> no specific lettering plan for the two Wall Street special rush-hour services, so it just designated these M (Nassau Street Express) temporarily, a letter reserved for use on the BMT Myrtle Avenue Line's Nassau Street service.|$|R
