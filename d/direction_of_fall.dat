There are statistically significant orientations in the root systems, {{which suggests that the}} root structure of the trees had responded to stress from westerly winds.

40|$|Natural {{disturbances}} introduce spatial heterogeneity into forests by causing non-random {{mortality of}} trees. We examined whether wind {{was the primary}} cause of spatial patterns of dead trees at fragment- and individual tree-levels in three fragments of temperate deciduous forests in Illinois, USA. Dead trees and wind-caused types of mortality were expected to be higher at forest edges, on windward aspects, in poorly-drained soils, and adjacent to existing canopy gaps. The extent of wind-related mortality was determined by comparing spatial and temporal patterns of dead trees, as well as characteristics of trees downed by single windstorms versus all dead trees. At the fragment-level, we used randomly located quadrats of 2525 m to sample edge and interior areas of Trelease Woods, Brownfield Woods, and Hart Woods in 1995 - 1996 and again in 1999 - 2000. We noted type of mortality standing dead, snapped-off, or uprooted trees, and measured DBH 10 cm and <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>fall</b> of each dead tree. The same measures were made for trees felled by two single storms in 1994. At the individual tree-level, domino effects were evaluated by comparing openness surrounding target treefalls vs. an equal sample size of living trees. The study provided limited evidence that wind caused spatial patterns of dead trees. Instead, spatial patterns of dead trees in the fragments accumulated from domino effects at the individual tree-level in two of the three fragments. Dead trees were more associated with preexisting gaps. Contrary to our predictions at the fragment-level, the frequency of dead trees was not greater at edges, on windward aspects, or in poorly drained soils. This study demonstrated the complexity of spatial patterns of dead trees in forest fragments. The significant domino effects indicated that the occurrence of dead trees was not random, but determined by previ-ous disturbances...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1995 Presentation date: 1994 - 06 - 06 The natural fall {{of trees}} in {{riparian}} areas is {{an important source of}} coarse woody debris for mountain streams, improving fish habitat and influencing stream morphology. Existing models consider the probability of coarse woody debris entering a stream channel based upon trees having a random <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>fall</b> without consideration of tree lean or wind direction. This research presents (1) the results of a field study to document tree lean of conifers near streams in two stands in the Oregon's Coast Range and (2) a physical and probabilistic model to estimate the probability of a tree falling into the stream including the effects of tree lean and wind direction. The measurement of 200 conifers along two creeks located in McDonald Forest found that tree lean varied from 1 to 34 percent uphill and 1 to 29 percent downhill on slopes of 1 to 88 percent. Approximately 75 percent of the trees leaned downhill and 25 percent of the trees leaned uphill. A significant linear relationship was found between lean and slope although there was considerable scatter around the regression line. In general, the steeper the slope, the greater the tree lean downhill. When tree lean data was stratified by aspect, the linear relationship was higher for the NE and SW aspects, slightly weaker for the NW aspect and not related with slope for the SE aspect. A physical model was developed for calculating the critical wind speed required to overturn a tree. This critical wind speed is a function of maximum resisting moment of the tree root structure, crown cross sectional area, initial tree lean and the angle formed between wind direction and lean direction on the horizontal plane. A probabilistic model was developed for determining the probability that a tree could fall and reach the stream. This probability is a function of exceedance probability for a particular period of time, wind direction probability, tree location and tree height. The models were applied to two old-growth coniferous stands. Douglas-fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco] trees were selected to illustrate how the models can be used. Results {{of this study indicate that}} tree lean is not a major factor with respect to influencing tree blowdown for the range of tree lean data collected from coniferous trees along streams in the study area. Tree lean could be a major factor if it was greater than that observed in this study...|$|E

60|$|Captain Bonneville, however, discredits, on the whole, {{the alleged}} sagacity of the beaver in this particular, and thinks the animal {{has no other}} aim than to get the tree down, {{without any of the}} subtle {{calculation}} as to its mode or <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>falling.</b> This attribute, he thinks, has been ascribed to them from the circumstance that most trees growing near water-courses, either lean bodily toward the stream, or stretch their largest limbs in that direction, to benefit by the space, the light, and the air to be found there. The beaver, of course, attacks those trees which are nearest at hand, and {{on the banks of the}} stream or pond. He makes incisions round them, or in technical phrase, belts them with his teeth, and when they fall, they naturally take the direction in which their trunks or branches preponderate.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Falling {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of serious health decline or injury-related deaths in the elderly. For {{survivors}} <b>of</b> a <b>fall,</b> the resulting health expenses can be a devastating burden, largely because of the long recovery time and potential comorbidities that ensue. The detection <b>of</b> a <b>fall</b> is, therefore, important in care of the elderly for decreasing the reaction time by the care-givers especially for those in care who are particularly frail or living alone. Recent advances in motion-sensor technology have enabled wearable sensors to be used efficiently for pervasive care of the elderly. In addition to fall detection, it is also important to determine the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> a <b>fall,</b> which could help in the location of joint weakness or post-fall fracture. This work uses a waist-worn sensor, encompassing a 3 D accelerometer and a barometric pressure sensor, for reliable fall detection and the determination <b>of</b> the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> a <b>fall.</b> Also assessed is an efficient analysis framework suitable for on-node implementation using a lowpower micro-controller that involves both feature extraction and fall detection.

40|$|The flow {{behavior}} and hot workability of FGH 4096 superalloys with different initial microstructures are investigated in this paper. The study alloys behave different flow behaviors due to different initial microstructures (hot isostatic pressed (HIPed) and fine grained (FGed) microstructures). At 1050 °C, FGed alloy shows higher flow stress than HIPed alloy. At high temperature (1080 - 1140 °C), however, FGed alloy has lower flow stress than HIPed alloy. Meanwhile, the studied alloys have different hot workability. To investigate the hot workability, advanced processing maps are built up and employed {{to study the}} workability.

40|$|Abstract. Human fall in {{the elderly}} {{population}} {{is one of the}} major causes of injury or bone fracture: it can be a cause of various injuries (e. g., fracture, concussion, and joint inflammation). It also could be a possible cause of death in a severe case. To detect human fall, various fall detection algorithms have been devised. Most fall detection algorithms rely on signals from a single accelerometer or gyroscope and use a threshold-based method to detect the human fall. However, these algorithms need careful adjustment of a threshold for each subject and cannot detect the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>falls.</b> In this study, we propose a novel fall recognition algorithm using a pair of a tri-axial accelerometer and a tri-axial gyroscope. Our fall recognition algorithm utilizes a set of augmented features including autoregressive (AR) modeling coefficients of signals, signal magnitude area (SMA), and gradients of angles from the sensors. After Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) of the augmented features, an Artificial Neural Nets (ANNs) is utilized to recognize four directional human falls: namely forward fall, backward fall, right-side fall, and left-side fall. Our recognition results show the mean recognition rate of 95. 8 %. Our proposed fall recognition technique should be useful in the investigation of fall-related injuries and possibly in the prevention <b>of</b> <b>falls</b> for the elderly...|$|R
