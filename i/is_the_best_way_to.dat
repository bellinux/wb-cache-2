5|$|Pilot {{whales are}} {{cetaceans}} {{belonging to the}} genus Globicephala. The two extant species are the long-finned pilot whale (G. melas) and the short-finned pilot whale (G. macrorhynchus). The two are not readily distinguishable at sea, {{and analysis of the}} skulls <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> distinguish between the species. Between the two species, they range nearly worldwide, with long-finned pilot whales living in colder waters and short-finned pilot whales living in tropical and subtropical waters. Pilot whales are among the largest of the oceanic dolphins, exceeded in size only by the killer whale. They and other large members of the dolphin family are also known as blackfish.|$|E

Alcohol and sleeping pills are respiratory depressants, and thus slow down the acclimatization process and should be avoided. Alcohol also tends to cause dehydration and exacerbates AMS. Thus, avoiding alcohol consumption in the first 24–48 hours at a higher altitude is optimal.|$|E

The leader of the Ugandan delegation, Internal Affairs Minister Ruhakana Rugunda stated that his priority was to obtain a quick ceasefire. The LRA delegation, led by Martin Ojul, said that LRA's acceptance of the peace talks should not be interpreted that LRA can no longer fight, but stressed that a negotiated settlement <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> end the conflict.|$|E
25|$|Eating a {{balanced}} diet {{with a range of}} foods from different food groups <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> avoid copper deficiency. In both developed and developing countries, adults, young children, and adolescents who consume diets of grain, millet, tuber, or rice along with legumes (beans) or small amounts of fish or meat, some fruits and vegetables, and some vegetable oil are likely to obtain adequate copper if their total food consumption is adequate in calories. In developed countries where consumption of red meat is high, copper intake is also likely to be adequate.|$|E
25|$|The Mayo Clinic has {{suggested}} seven steps: stay mentally active, socialize regularly, get organized, eat a healthy diet, include {{physical activity in}} your daily routine, and manage chronic conditions. Because some {{of the causes of}} memory loss include medications, stress, depression, heart disease, alcohol abuse, thyroid problems, vitamin B12 deficiency, not drinking enough water, and not eating nutritiously, fixing those problems could be a simple, effective way to slow down dementia. Some say that exercise <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> prevent memory problems, because that would increase blood flow to the brain and perhaps help new brain cells grow.|$|E

25|$|In the United Kingdom an {{absolute}} drought currently {{defined as a}} period of at least 15 consecutive days or more where there is less than 0.2mm (0.008inches) of rainfall., although before the 1990s a drought was defined as 15 consecutive days with less than 0.25mm (0.01inches) rain on any one day. This previous definition sometimes led to confusion, as many argued that if less than 0.25mm of rain fell in 30 days, is that 2 droughts and if 0.26mm fell after 25 days, is the drought over? This led to the new definition but many believe hindsight <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> judge if a drought has occurred.|$|E
25|$|Another {{challenge}} of feminist historians is integration in digital format. Women’s historians {{have had some}} success in working with digital humanists in creating their databases, but the databases {{are few and far}} between. This creates a problem for feminist historians trying to create a feminist history database based on women’s history databases. Since data mining is not a field many digital humanist women are involved in, it can be a challenge to find the necessary relationships between these few. Though Filene argues that data mining <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> integrate histories, this lack of involvement by feminist digital humanists detaches the work from others sharing similar feminist historian’s work.|$|E
25|$|One {{issue with}} trials is what {{to use as}} a placebo {{treatment}} group or non-treatment control group. Often this is patients on a waiting list, or people receiving some kind of regular non-specific contact or support. One issue <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> match the use of inert tablets or sham treatments in placebo-controlled studies in pharmaceutical trials. Several interpretations and differing assumptions and language remain. Another issue is the attempt to standardize and manualize therapies and link them to specific symptoms of diagnostic categories, making them more amenable to research. Some report that this may reduce efficacy or gloss over individual needs. Finagy and Roth's opinion is that the benefits of the evidence-based approach outweighs the difficulties.|$|E

25|$|Frostbite is {{localized}} {{damage to}} skin and other tissues due to freezing. At or below , blood vessels {{close to the}} skin start to constrict, and blood is shunted away from the extremities. The same response {{may also be a}} result of exposure to high winds. This constriction helps to preserve core body temperature. In extreme cold, or when the body is exposed to cold for long periods, this protective strategy can reduce blood flow in some areas of the body to dangerously low levels. This lack of blood leads to the eventual freezing and death of skin tissue in the affected areas. Frostbite was responsible for over one million casualties in wars in the 20th Century. Adequate insulation from clothing <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> avoid hypothermia in the field.|$|E
25|$|Because enamel is {{vulnerable}} to demineralization, prevention of tooth decay <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> maintain the health of teeth. Most countries have wide use of toothbrushes, which can {{reduce the number of}} dental biofilm and food particles on enamel. In isolated societies that {{do not have access to}} toothbrushes, it is common for those people to use other objects, such as sticks, to clean their teeth. In between two adjacent teeth, floss is used to wipe the enamel surfaces free of plaque and food particles to discourage bacterial growth. Although neither floss nor toothbrushes can penetrate the deep grooves and pits of enamel, good general oral-health habits can usually prevent enough bacterial growth to keep tooth decay from starting. Genetic variations, in humans, might contribute to the intrinsic structural integrity of the enamel, and to its predisposition to demineralization or attack from bacteria.|$|E
25|$|An {{article in}} the American journal for Economics has {{addressed}} the issue of Utilitarian ethics within redistribution of wealth. The journal stated that taxation of the wealthy <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> make use of the disposable income they receive. This says that the money creates utility for the most people by funding government services. Many utilitarian philosophers, including Peter Singer and Toby Ord, argue that inhabitants of developed countries in particular have an obligation to help to end extreme poverty across the world, for example by regularly donating some of their income to charity. Peter Singer, for example, argues that donating some of one's income to charity could help to save a life or cure somebody from a poverty-related illness, which is a much better use of the money as it brings someone in extreme poverty far more happiness than it would bring to oneself if one lived in relative comfort. However, Singer not only argues that one ought to donate a significant proportion of one's income to charity, but also that this money should be directed to the most cost-effective charities, in order to bring about the greatest good for the greatest number, consistent with utilitarian thinking. Singer's ideas have formed the basis of the modern effective altruist movement.|$|E
