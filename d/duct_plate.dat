5000|$|The {{majority}} of cement plant process ductwork is round. This {{is because the}} round duct shape does not bend between circumferential stiffeners. Therefor bending stiffeners are not required, and round ductwork requires fewer and lighter intermediate stiffeners than rectangular ductwork.

Unlike the Japanese EJ205, the US-spec engine uses a Mitsubishi TD04-13T turbocharger unit. In stock form, it reaches a peak [...] of boost. The seats {{are the same as}} the basic J-spec Impreza. The wheels are cast 16" [...] x 6.5" [...] version of the J-spec WRX NB wheels while the brakes are 2-piston/1-piston front and rear with the front rotors being ventilated disks. 2002 WRXs came with brake <b>duct</b> <b>plates</b> that guided the air in the front bumper vent to the wheel well. The gear ratios are the standard export models, but the final drive is a 3.9:1 ratio. The rear LSD is a viscous coupling type. The steering rack has a ratio of 16.5:1. The 4 gear electronic automatic transmission (4EAT) WRXs have a Variable Torque Distribution AWD system instead of the conventional viscous coupling center differential. VTD employs an electronically controlled hydraulic transfer clutch and a planetary gear center differential to distribute power in a 45:55 split between the front and rear axles under normal circumstances. The VTD system uses multiple sensors to measure front and rear driveshaft speeds, throttle position and gear selection. Then it actively transfers power accordingly between the front and rear wheels for optimum traction and handling. The WRX weighs 3085 lb.|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of the intrahepatic bile ducts in man was studied using an immunohistochemical technique on 56 liver specimens {{ranging in age from}} 6 weeks of gestation to 8 months after birth. On paraffin sections, two monoclonal anticytokeratin antibodies (CAM 5. 2 and KL- 1) that normally stain both hepatocytes and bile duct cells and two polyclonal anticytokeratin antisera that in normal adult liver stain bile ducts only were applied. For immunohistochemical staining of cryostat sections (only available from 14 weeks of gestation on), four monoclonal antibodies specifically directed against individual cytokeratin polypeptides 7, 8, 18 and 19 were used. Adult human hepatocytes contain cytokeratin 8 and 18 whereas bile duct cells also express cytokeratin 7 and 19 in addition to cytokeratin 8 and 18. On paraffin sections, primitive hepatocytes were stained with monoclonal antibodies CAM 5. 2 and KL- 1 from 6 weeks of gestation on. On cryostat sections, they were positive with monoclonal antibodies anticytokeratin 8 and 18 from the earliest time point examined (14 weeks). From 9 weeks of gestation on, portal vein branches were surrounded by a layer of cells showing a stronger positive reaction with monoclonal antibodies CAM 5. 2 and KL- 1 on paraffin sections and with monoclonal antibodies anti-cytokeratin 8 and 18 on cryostat sections (only available from 14 weeks on). This layer, referred to as the ductal plate, first appeared around large portal vein branches close to the hilum and subsequently around more peripheral branches. The <b>duct</b> <b>plates</b> became duplicated over variably long segments of their perimeter, lumina appeared and tubular structures were formed. The latter gradually became incorporated in the connective tissue surrounding the portal vein, resulting in the appearance of individualized bile <b>ducts.</b> Ductal <b>plate</b> cells were stained by both polyclonal anticytokeratin antisera on paraffin sections. On cryostat sections (available from 14 weeks of gestation on), they were immunoreactive for cytokeratin 19 but negative with the monoclonal antibody directed against cytokeratin 7 until 20 weeks of gestation. From then on, weakly positive staining for cytokeratin 7 was detected, but staining intensity subsequently increased and reached the level observed in adult liver at 1 month after birth. At birth, the smallest branches of the portal vein were still surrounded by a discontinuous ductal plate. We conclude that intrahepatic bile duct cells develop from hepatocytes around branches of the portal vein. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|Ducts {{are usually}} {{designed}} {{as if the}} <b>duct</b> <b>plate</b> and stiffener temperatures match the internal duct gas temperatures. For mild carbon steels (ASTM A36) temperatures, the design yield stress ratio at 300°F is 84% of room temperature stress. At 500°F, the design yield stress ratio is 77% of room temperature stress. At 700°F, the design yield stress ratio is about 71% of room temperature stress. Temperatures above 800°F may cause mild carbon steel to warp. This is because, in this temperature range, the crystal lattice structure of mild carbon steel changes with temperatures above about 800 degrees F (reference, US Steel Plate, elevated temperature steel).|$|E

The General Atomic Company has specified both damage and safety limit criteria for these plates. These plates have been analyzed at these limits using the inelastic finite element computer program EPACA. The results indicate that the total strains for the square plate were within the specified values; however, the maximum deformations at the free corners indicate separation from the insulation and failure to achieve one of the design requirements.

The technical difficulties faced whilst performing experimental tests made CFD almost the only possible way to study the flow field in detail. In the present work the flow of sand-water mixtures through a sudden expansion in a rectangular horizontal duct is investigated by means of a two-fluid model. Due to the lack of experimental data available, a sensitivity analysis is performed to quantify the influence of the terms of the two-fluid model which proved negligible in the horizontal pipe case, topic of previous investigations.

40|$|A plate {{silencer}} {{consists of}} an expansion chamber with two side-branch cavities covered by light but extremely stiff plates. It works effectively with a wide stopband from low-to-medium frequencies only if the plate is extremely stiff, to ensure a strong reflection of acoustic wave to the upstream in the <b>duct.</b> However, a <b>plate</b> with a slightly weak bending stiffness will result in non-uniform transmission loss (TL) spectra with narrowed stopband. In this study, a hybrid silencer is proposed by introducing micro-perforations into the plate to elicit the sound absorption in order {{to compensate for the}} deficiency in the passband caused by the insufficient sound reflection in a certain frequency range due to weaker plate stiffness. A theoretical model, capable of dealing with the strong coupling between the vibrating micro-perforated plate and sound fields inside the cavity and the duct, is developed. Through proper balancing between the sound absorption and reflection, the proposed hybrid silencer provides a more flattened and uniform TL and a widened stopband by more than 20 % while relaxing the harsh requirement on the bending stiffness of the plate. Theoretical predictions are validated by experimental data, with phenomenon explained through numerical analyses. Department of Mechanical EngineeringAuthor name used in this publication: X. N.
