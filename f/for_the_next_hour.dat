5|$|At 08:30 Robertson and Lalor {{decided to}} take their {{companies}} up Baby 700. Instead of going round to the right like Tulloch, they went straight up the centre, crossed over the summit onto the northern slope and went to ground. A spur on their left, leading to Suvla Bay, was defended by a Turkish trench system. At 09:15 Turkish troops started moving down Battleship Hill, and <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>hour</b> they exchanged fire. Where the spur joined Baby 700, a group of Australians from the 9th, 11th, and 12th Battalions crossed Malone's Gully and charged the Turkish trench. A Turkish machine-gun on Baby 700 opened fire on them, forcing them back, followed by a general withdrawal of Australian troops. The Turks had secured Battleship Hill and were now driving the Australians off Baby 700. From his headquarters {{at the head of}} Monash Valley, Maclagen could see the Turks attacking, and started sending all available men towards Baby 700.|$|E
5|$|<b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>hour</b> and a {{half the}} frigates poured shot into one another at close range, until Cooke was struck by grape shot at 01:30 on 1 March, {{replaced}} by his first lieutenant Lucius Hardyman. For another hour the action continued, French fire gradually slackening until it stopped completely at 02:30, by which time only four French guns remained operational. Hardyman hailed to ask whether Forte had surrendered but the French did not reply and he ordered another broadside. A second hail also brought no response but sailors were seen attempting to repair the rigging on Forte. Concerned that the French were attempting to escape, Hardyman concentrated his fire on the masts of Forte, bringing them crashing down one by one until at 03:00 Forte was completely dismasted. With all resistance ended, British merchant prisoners on board Forte emerged from below decks and hailed Sybille, requesting a boat be sent across so that British Lieutenant Nicholas Manger could formally take the surrender of the French ship.|$|E

500|$|Around 11:00, the French van began {{firing at}} long range, with little effect. By 12:30 the two fleets were aligned, but deGrasse refused to close with Hood, despite Hood's {{efforts to bring}} the French to him. The fleets then {{exchanged}} cannonades and broadsides at a distance <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>hour.</b> The damage incurred on either side was modest; the four British ships on {{the southern end of}} the line suffered the most damage from having been targeted and outnumbered by eight French ships. The 74-gun [...] suffered in particular, and that night Hood sent her to StEustatius. Arriving on 4May, her commander was able to brief Rodney about the engagement and French numbers. British casualties amounted to 43 dead and 161 wounded, of which Gibraltars share was 6 and 16, respectively.|$|E

500|$|Franklin, {{positioned}} {{just ahead}} of Brueys's flagship, the 120-gun Orient, and astern of the 74-gun Peuple Souverain, came under fire from , [...] and [...] The British ships and the French centre exchanged a heavy fire, with the British being joined by the newly arrived , [...] and [...] As Du Chayla later recalled 'The action in this part then became extremely warm.' The two sides were intensely engaged <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>hour,</b> during which the Peuple Souverain was {{forced out of the}} line, and the Orient caught fire. As the fire on Orient raged out of control, the nearby French and British ships scrambled to escape the anticipated explosion. Orients magazine blew up at 9:37p.m., obliterating her and sending burning debris raining down on the nearby ships. Large amounts fell upon the Franklin, starting fires which caused the arms locker to explode and set fire to the poop and quarterdeck.|$|E
500|$|Fremantle then {{spotted the}} towering {{mass of the}} Spanish four-decker Santísima Trinidad sailing away from him, and steered towards her {{starboard}} quarter {{in the hope of}} raking her stern. Opening fire with his larboard battery, he positioned Neptune off the Spanish vessel's starboard beam and the two exchanged heavy fire <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>hour</b> as more British ships poured through the gap astern of Neptune. Neptune took fire from other ships of the combined fleet as they sailed past. Santísima Trinidad, heavily battered by Neptunes guns, as well as those from the 74-gun ships [...] and , became completely dismasted and covered in debris. She fought on until 5.30 pm, when she struck her colours, having sustained casualties of 205 dead and 103 wounded. Neptune left the 98-gun [...] to take possession and headed north to cut off the remains of the enemy fleet, briefly becoming engaged with the French 74-gun Intrépide. During the battle Neptune suffered considerable damage to her masts, although they did not fall. Most of her rigging was cut to pieces and she sustained nine shot holes in her hull. She sustained casualties of ten killed and 34 wounded. A remarkably small proportion of her officers became casualties, with only the captain's clerk, Richard Hurrell, being wounded.|$|E
500|$|After the one-day postponement, Cobra got {{underway}} at 09:38 on 25 July, when around 600 Allied fighter-bombers attacked strongpoints and enemy artillery along a -wide {{strip of}} ground {{located in the}} St. Lô area. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>hour,</b> 1,800 heavy bombers of the U.S. Eighth Air Force saturated a [...] area on the Saint-Lô–Periers road, succeeded by a third and final wave of medium bombers. Approximately 3,000 U.S. aircraft had carpet-bombed a narrow section of the front, with the Panzer-Lehr-Division taking {{the brunt of the}} attack. However, once again not all the casualties were German; Bradley had specifically requested that the bombers approach the target from the east, out of the sun and parallel to the Saint-Lô–Periers road, in order to minimize the risk of friendly losses, but most of the airmen instead came in from the north, perpendicular to the front line. Bradley, however, had apparently misunderstood explanations from the heavy bomber commanders that a parallel approach was impossible because of the time and space constraints Bradley had set. Additionally, a parallel approach would not in any event have assured that all bombs would fall behind German lines because of deflection errors or obscured aim points due to dust and smoke. Despite efforts by U.S. units to identify their positions, inaccurate bombing by the Eighth Air Force killed 111 men and wounded 490. The dead included Bradley's friend and fellow West Pointer Lieutenant General Lesley McNair—the highest-ranking U.S. soldier to be killed in action in the European Theater of Operations.|$|E

She then struck. The French ship was Décade, with a crew of 336 men under the command of Citoyen Villeneau. Décade was pierced for 44 guns, but she had landed ten in Cayenne, from where she had sailed. In all, Naiad had chased Décade for 36 hours. The British took Décade back to Plymouth. She was registered there in October and fitted out there between April and December 1799.|$|E

2500|$|On 12 October 1969, {{a caller}} to Detroit radio station WKNR-FM told disc jockey Russ Gibb about the rumour and its clues. Gibb and other callers then {{discussed}} the rumour {{on the air}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>hour.</b> Two days after the WKNR broadcast, The Michigan Daily published a satirical review of Abbey Road by University of Michigan student Fred LaBour under the headline [...] "McCartney Dead; New Evidence Brought to Light". It identified various clues to McCartney's death on Beatles album covers, including new clues from the just-released Abbey Road LP. LaBour had invented many of the clues, and he was astonished when the story {{was picked up by}} newspapers across the United States. WKNR-FM further fuelled the rumour with a special two-hour program on the subject, [...] "The Beatle Plot", which aired 19 October 1969 (and in the years since on Detroit radio).|$|E

The child, when she left home, was without hat, and her clothing tallies in every respect with that found on the dead body. There was no ring or other ornament, and in that respect, the descriptions correspond. Excepting only as to the color of the eyes, which cannot be clearly observed as to color, the descriptions are identical." ...|$|E
2500|$|Heavily {{outnumbered by}} Boedicker's four light cruisers, Chester was pounded before being {{relieved}} by Hood's heavy units, which swung westward for that purpose. Hood's flagship [...] disabled the light cruiser [...] shortly after 17:56. Wiesbaden became a sitting target {{for most of}} the British fleet during the next hour, but remained afloat and fired some torpedoes at the passing enemy battleships from long range. Meanwhile, Boedicker's other ships turned toward Hipper and Scheer in the mistaken belief that Hood was leading a larger force of British capital ships from the north and east. A chaotic destroyer action in mist and smoke ensued as German torpedo boats attempted to blunt the arrival of this new formation, but Hood's battlecruisers dodged all the torpedoes fired at them. In this action, after leading a torpedo counter-attack, the British destroyer [...] was disabled, but continued to return fire at numerous passing enemy ships <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>hour.</b>|$|E
