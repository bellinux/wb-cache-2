5000|$|This {{plant was}} {{introduced}} to the United States when it was intentionally planted in Arlington, Virginia, by the USDA in 1919. This species and <b>Japanese</b> <b>clover</b> were used to revegetate abandoned coal mine sites. Its seed was spread to attract wildlife and as a forage for livestock. It was used to prevent erosion along roadsides. It was planted in rotation with cereal crops to enhance the soil. It persisted and spread. Today this plant grows in the wild and provides food for a number of mammal and bird species. It is also a high-quality livestock forage. The seed is still sold for planting. Three cultivars are available: [...] "Climax", [...] "Harbin", and [...] "Rowan". Despite its status as a weed in some areas, it is not very aggressive and not considered a noxious weed.|$|E

2500|$|In the 21st {{century and}} at least until 2010, the <b>Japanese</b> company <b>Clover</b> was {{producing}} the bright green pendant Mini Kacha-Kacha which is designed like a hand-held mechanical tally counter, but is oriented upside-down on a neck pendant for easy reading by the user. It has a button to advance the numbers singly, access to the knurled number rings for adjustment of numbers, and a lock to prevent interference by the user dropping the gadget or by children playing with it. On this type of gadget it has been possible for the manufacturer to make the numbers larger and therefore easier to read than on the on-needle counter, which needs to be small. [...] In August 2007 the UK magazine Simply Knitting no.32 gave away a free pendant knitting counter in a form of a white sheep, and in June 2010 the same magazine no.67 gave away another one {{in the shape of}} a yellow flower. Unfortunately the numerals on the yellow flower version were oriented incorrectly, causing inconvenience for the wearer of the pendant.|$|R
