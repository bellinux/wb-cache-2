Our tracts of wood and water are almost diminutive in comparison; therefore, as far as sublimity is dependent upon absolute bulk and height, and atmospherical influences in connection with these, it is obvious, {{that there can be no}} rivalship. But a short residence among the British Mountains will furnish abundant proof, that, after a certain point of elevation, viz. that which allows of compact and fleecy clouds settling upon, or sweeping over, the summits, the sense of sublimity depends more upon form and relation of objects to each other than upon their actual magnitude; and that an elevation of 3000 feet is sufficient to call forth in a most impressive degree the creative, and magnifying, and softening powers of the atmosphere. Hence, on the score even of sublimity, the superiority of the Alps is by no means so great as might hastily be inferred;--and, as to the beauty of the lower regions of the Swiss Mountains, it is noticeable--that, as they are all regularly mown, their surface has nothing of that mellow tone and variety of hues by which mountain turf, that is never touched by the scythe, is distinguished. On the smooth and steep slopes of the Swiss hills, these plots of verdure do indeed agreeably unite their colour with that of the deciduous trees, or make a lively contrast with the dark green pine-groves that define them, and among which they run in endless variety of shapes--but this is most pleasing at first sight; the permanent gratification of the eye requires finer gradations of tone, and a more delicate blending of hues into each other. Besides, it is only in spring and late autumn that cattle animate by their presence the Swiss lawns; and, though the pastures of the higher regions where they feed during the summer are left in their natural state of flowery herbage, those pastures are so remote, that their texture and colour are of no consequence in the composition of any picture in which a lake of the Vales is a feature. Yet in those lofty regions, how vegetation is invigorated by the genial climate of that country! Among the luxuriant flowers there met with, groves, or forests, if I may so call them, of Monks-hood are frequently seen; the plant of deep, rich blue, and as tall as in our gardens; and this at an elevation where, in Cumberland, <b>Icelandic</b> <b>moss</b> would only be found, or the stony summits be utterly bare.|$|E
50|$|The {{issue of}} a lack of grain was {{overcome}} in different ways {{in different parts of the}} country. In some areas, grain was made to go further using Dulse (Palmaria palmata; söl), Iceland Moss (Cetraria islandica; IS: fjallagrös) or Irish Moss (Chondrus crispus; fjörugrös) in compotes and breads, or by flattening the dough so thin that the bread became almost transparent. In the SE region (Skaftafellssýslur), locals knew how to use the lyme grass (Leymus arenarius) (melkorn; sometimes called the Icelandic grain) for centuries, where it was used in compotes, bread, pancakes, etc. These grain substitutes gave the bread a distinctive character. Dulse breads and biscuits can be made by mixing Dulse, rye, and <b>Icelandic</b> <b>Moss</b> in equal proportions.|$|E

Pottery was made in a time like manner and used to cook grain and Icelandmoss and exposed to an organized biodegradation experiment inside an incubatorfor later analyzes with the GC-MS-method. Tests were also taken from pottery,grain and Iceland moss that had not been exposed for a biodegrading attempt. The grain is a domesticated cereal and the <b>Icelandic</b> <b>moss</b> fungi-alga mix. Thetest results showed mostly saturated fatty acids, sterols and monoacylglycerolsof saturated fatty acids. Within the laboratory archeology, ergosterol has beensuggested as a possible biomarker for yeast and alcohol fermentation. TheIceland moss contains ergosterol and is therefore relevant for the study whenit can be compared to archeological pottery that contains ergosterol. Theresults didn’t show any traces of ergostrol with the biodegraded pottery, butlow traces of cholesterol witch probably is contaminations from the handlingwith the pottery...|$|E

Annotine does not inhibit acetylcholinesterase, as some other lycopodium alkaloids do, and other bioactivities have not been reported. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of annotine on maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and their ability to activate allogeneic CD 4 (+) T cells. Human monocyte-derived DCs were matured in the absence or presence of annotine at a concentration of 1, 10 or 100 μg/ml. The effect of the annotine on maturation of the DCs was determined by measuring concentration of cytokines in culture supernatant by ELISA and expression of surface molecules by flow cytometry. DCs matured in the absence or presence of annotine at 100 µg/ml were also co-cultured with allogeneic CD 4 (+) T cells and concentration of cytokines in supernatants determined by ELISA and expression of surface molecules by flow cytometry. When cultured alone, DCs matured in the presence of annotine secreted less of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL- 6 and IL- 23 and had a tendency toward less secretion of IL- 12 p 40 than DCs matured in the absence of annotine. However, when DCs were matured in the presence of annotine and then co-cultured with allogeneic CD 4 (+) T cells they secreted more IL- 12 p 40 and had a tendency toward secreting more IL- 6 than DCs matured in the absence of annotine and then co-cultured with T cells. Allogeneic CD 4 (+) T cells co-cultured with DCs matured in the presence of annotine secreted more IL- 13 than T cells co-cultured with DCs matured in the absence of annotine, but stimulating the DCs in the presence of annotine did not affect T cell secretion of IFN-γ and IL- 17. There was also more IL- 10 in co-cultures of T cells and DCs matured in the presence of annotine than in co-cultures of T cells and DCs matured in the absence of annotine. These results show that annotine increases the ability of DCs to direct the differentiation of allogeneic CD 4 (+) T cells toward a Th 2 /Treg phenotype, which may be of interest in the development of new treatments for Th 1 - and/or Th 17 -mediated inflammatory diseases...|$|R
40|$|There is good {{evidence}} that rheological properties {{play a key}} role in deter-mining the health benefits of cereal ?-glucans. The primary focus of studies has been flow viscosity. Because of the power law relationship between concentration or molecular weight, and viscosity, small differences in solubility or molecular weight can profoundly influence viscosity development in solution (halving concentration may produce a 15 fold decrease in zero shear viscosity). Depolymerisation similarly may have a profound effect on flow viscosity, but as well as reducing the measured flow viscosity, the elasticity, or gel character of the solution may increase. In model clinical studies of glycemic response, using different preparations of ?-glucan, about 90 % of the differences between different treatments could be accounted for by the flow viscosity of the drinks consumed by the subjects, but the influence of gel formation on glycemic response is unclear. Oats and barley are the primary source of ?-glucan but it is also found in rye, wheat and the lichen <b>Icelandic</b> <b>Moss.</b> Structural analysis show that the ?-glucan from all sources is com-posed primarily of ?-(1 ? 3) -linked cellotriosyl and cellotetraosyl units, but there are also regions that are more cellulose-like in character, with 4 or more consecutive ?-(1 ? 4) -linked glucose units. There are some differences between the structures of these different ?-glucans, and these, as well as molecular weight, modify the ability to form gels. Studies of the different gelation characteristics of the ?-glucans have allowed conclusions as to the mechanism of gelation. Böhm N. & Kulicke, W. -M. 1999 a.
