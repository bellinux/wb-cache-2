5|$|The {{book was}} criticised by big game hunter and {{politician}} Theodore Roosevelt for its central assertion that {{every aspect of}} animal coloration is effective as camouflage. Roosevelt's detailed reply attacked the biased choice of <b>examples</b> <b>to</b> suit Abbott Thayer's thesis and the book's reliance on unsubstantiated claims in place of evidence. The book was more evenly criticised by zoologist and camouflage researcher Hugh Cott, who valued Thayer's work on countershading but regretted his overenthusiastic attempts to explain all animal coloration as camouflage. Thayer was mocked {{to a greater or}} lesser extent by other scientific reviewers.|$|E

25|$|A {{large number}} of violent antisemitic attacks in Europe were done by Muslims- the murder of 4 Jews in Toulouse in 2012 by Mohammed Merah, the 1982 attack on the Jewish Goldenberg {{restaurant}} in Paris that {{was carried out by}} Arab terrorists, the kidnapping and murder of the French citizen Ilan Halimi in 2006 by a Muslim gang and the antisemitic riots in Norway in 2009 are a few <b>examples</b> <b>to</b> this phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|The {{scale of}} {{destruction}} in these waves {{was such that}} the Ghent historian Marcus Van Vaenewijk (1516–69) recorded that {{in the summer of}} 1566 the burning pyres on which the works were thrown could be seen from 10 miles away. Because of this, art historian Susie Nash points out that the Ghent work seems so unusual in part because {{it was one of the}} few major <b>examples</b> <b>to</b> survive wholly intact.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{earliest}} examples of Jones’s decoration as applied to architecture (and {{one of the few}} <b>examples</b> <b>to</b> exist today, albeit restored) was his work on Christ Church, Streatham, built in 1841 by James Wild (1814–1892), who later became Jones's brother-in-law. Jones was responsible for the interior decoration, but would most probably have also contributed to the design of the exterior which exhibits brick polychromy and architectural details with Byzantine and Islamic influences.|$|E
25|$|Paris' {{abduction}} of Helen {{had several}} precedents. Io {{was taken from}} Mycenae, Europa was taken from Phoenicia, Jason took Medea from Colchis, and the Trojan princess Hesione had been taken by Heracles, who gave her to Telamon of Salamis. According to Herodotus, Paris was emboldened by these <b>examples</b> <b>to</b> steal himself a wife from Greece, and expected no retribution, since there had been none in the other cases.|$|E
25|$|In June, {{the first}} Israeli F-35A was {{unveiled}} with Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman present. The plane was to undergo further testing and actually be delivered in December. At {{the time it}} was stated that Israel had ordered 33 F-35's for delivery through 2021, with an option for 17 more. In November the Prime Minister's Office announced Israel was exercising the 17 options, after a unanimous vote of the Security Cabinet in favor, taking the total number of ordered <b>examples</b> <b>to</b> 50.|$|E

25|$|Of the {{abundant}} Chinese ritual bronze artifacts extant today, about 12,000 have inscriptions. These have been periodically unearthed ever since their creation, {{and have been}} systematically collected and studied {{since at least the}} Song dynasty. The inscriptions tend to grow in length over time, from only one to six or so characters for the earlier Shang <b>examples,</b> <b>to</b> forty or so characters in the longest, late-Shang case, and frequently a hundred or more on Zhou bronzes, with the longest up to around 500.|$|E
25|$|Over {{arbitrary}} fields, another {{class of}} finite {{groups that have}} a good representation theory are the finite groups of Lie type. Important examples are linear algebraic groups over finite fields. The representation theory of linear algebraic groups and Lie groups extends these <b>examples</b> <b>to</b> infinite-dimensional groups, the latter being intimately related to Lie algebra representations. The importance of character theory for finite groups has an analogue {{in the theory of}} weights for representations of Lie groups and Lie algebras.|$|E
