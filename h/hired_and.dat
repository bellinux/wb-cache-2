5|$|After {{the show}} was {{cancelled}} and Sheridan became unemployed, he began writing for the animated television series Family Guy. Although initially skeptical, he accepted the job as {{he did not have}} other options. Sheridan {{was one of the first}} writers <b>hired,</b> <b>and</b> has continued to write for the show through its eleventh season. For his work on Family Guy, he has been nominated for five Primetime Emmy Awards, a British Academy Television Award, and has won a DVD Exclusive Award. Sheridan has also written episodes of Titus and Yes, Dear. He is divorced and has one daughter.|$|E

5|$|In Texas in 1913, Pike Bishop, {{the leader}} of a gang of aging outlaws, is seeking {{retirement}} with one final score: the robbery of a railroad office containing a cache of silver. They are ambushed by Pike's former partner, Deke Thornton, who is leading a posse of bounty hunters <b>hired</b> <b>and</b> deputized by the railroad. A bloody shootout kills several of the gang. Pike uses a serendipitous temperance union parade to shield their getaway, and many citizens are killed in the crossfire.|$|E
40|$|Strong {{hysteresis}} in {{the labour}} market (see Cross, 1995) requires workers to be heterogeneous {{in terms of}} the cost of <b>hiring</b> <b>and</b> firing. We show how such heterogeneity arises naturally in labour markets due to differences in workersâ€™ age by showing that both the <b>hiring</b> <b>and</b> the firing thresholds for productivity are age dependent. The presence of strong hysteresis does not for this reason depend on ad-hoc differences in the cost of <b>hiring</b> <b>and</b> firing workers.

5|$|Recognizing at {{an early}} age that he had an incisive mind for politics, Marcas had allied himself with an unnamed man of some fame who lacked wisdom and insight. They became a team, with the other man serving as the public face and Marcas as the advisor. Once his {{associate}} had ascended into office, however, he abandoned Marcas, then <b>hired</b> <b>and</b> abandoned him again. Marcas was left poor and unknown, resigned to duplicate the writing of others for very little pay.|$|E

5|$|The kingdom {{was divided}} into provinces named Nadu, Vishaya, Kampana and Desha, listed in {{descending}} order of geographical size. Each province had a local governing body consisting of a minister (Mahapradhana) and a treasurer (Bhandari) that reported to the ruler of that province (Dandanayaka). Under this local ruler were officials called Heggaddes and Gavundas who <b>hired</b> <b>and</b> supervised the local farmers and labourers recruited to till the land. Subordinate ruling clans such as Alupas continued to govern their respective territories while following the policies set by the empire.|$|E

5|$|CTW {{solicited}} the Educational Testing Service (ETS) {{to conduct}} its summative research. CTW and ETS <b>hired</b> <b>and</b> trained coordinators, testers, and observers from local communities to conduct these studies. The most relevant {{tests of the}} show's effectiveness were comparisons between children who watched it regularly {{and those who did}} not. After the first season, however, Sesame Street was so widely watched that it was difficult to make this distinction; ETS began to have problems finding subjects for their non-viewing groups, which weakened the experimental design. It solved this problem by selecting control-group households from areas that did not broadcast the show. Instead of using groups of viewers and non-viewers, later large-scale studies used statistical designs and methods for estimating cause-effect relationships.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{navigation}} being closed, {{a guide to}} Midhurst published in 1895 advertised that skiffs could be <b>hired,</b> <b>and</b> fishing could be enjoyed. The boats were hired out by a plumber called William Port, and his business continued to prosper until 1912, when his boathouse burned down. Rowing boats were also available for hire at Coultershaw and Fittleworth. Another book called A New Oarsman's Guide, published in 1896, suggested that the river could be canoed from Iping to the Arun, a distance of , when there was sufficient water. By that time, none of the locks were workable, and boats had to be carried around them.|$|E
5|$|In late 2009, Dover was {{selected}} as a Technical/Coach Advisor for the Canadian dressage team, with a contract that extended through the 2010 World Equestrian Games in Lexington, Kentucky. After the Games, {{it was announced that}} Dover and the Canadian team {{had not been able to}} agree on contract renewal terms, but in late 2010 it was announced that Dover would remain as the interim trainer for the first quarter of 2011. In March 2011, German equestrian Markus Gribbe was <b>hired,</b> <b>and</b> Dover's term as a Canadian coach came to an end. Dover is known for his coaching abilities, with some of the best dressage riders with top international titles to their credit coming from his stables. During his time as a trainer for Canada, he was no longer be eligible to train top riders with the USEF. In April 2013, Dover was named Technical Advisor/Chef d'Equipe of the US national dressage team. He is expected to remain in the position through the 2016 Summer Olympics. Dover is currently a rider and trainer at Stillpoint Farm in Florida.|$|E

5|$|Iron Duke, {{named after}} the {{nickname}} for Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, was the first ship of her name {{to serve in the}} Royal Navy. The ship was laid down at Pembroke Dockyard on 23 August 1868, launched on 1 March 1870 and was completed on 1 January 1871, at a cost of Â£208,763. She was initially assigned as a First Reserve Guardship at Plymouth, but was assigned as the flagship of the China Station in September. En route to the Far East, she became the first ironclad to use the Suez canal; virtually all of her coal had to be unloaded to reduce her draught and she was towed by three tugboats through the canal in three days. Relieved by her sister ship, , Iron Duke returned to the UK in 1875. To save money on the return ship, no tugboats were <b>hired</b> <b>and</b> the ship ran aground four times and frequently scraped the sides of the canal during her four-day transit. Upon her arrival, she was paid off in May.|$|E
5|$|Judge Green {{presided over}} a number of notable cases during his 35-year tenure on the Eastern District. In Bolden v. Pennsylvania State Police Judge Green ordered the Pennsylvania State Police to {{reinstate}} William Bolden, a minority trooper who had been dismissed. The case, which began in 1973, resulted in a consent decree that required the State Police to hire one minority for every non-minority <b>hired,</b> <b>and</b> set additional goals for promotion and retention of minority troopers. Judge Green presided over the consent decree for 25 years, dissolving it in 1999. The case was credited with helping to abolish racism in the hiring of troopers, and integrate the State Police.|$|E

5|$|Pixar got {{its start}} in 1974 when New York Institute of Technology's (NYIT) founder Alexander Schure, who was also {{the owner of a}} {{traditional}} animation studio, established the Computer Graphics Lab (CGL), recruited computer scientists who shared his ambitions about creating the world's first computer-animated film. Edwin Catmull and Malcolm Blanchard were the first to be <b>hired</b> <b>and</b> were soon joined by Alvy Ray Smith and David DiFrancesco some months later, which were the four original members of the Computer Graphics Lab. Schure kept pouring money into the computer graphics lab, an estimated $15million, giving the group everything they desired and driving NYIT into serious financial troubles. Eventually, the group realized they needed to work in a real film studio in order to reach their goal, and when George Lucas approached them and offered them a job at his studio, six employees decided to move over to Lucasfilm. During the following months, they gradually resigned from CGL, found temporary jobs for about a year to avoid making Schure suspicious, before they joined The Graphics Group at Lucasfilm.|$|E
