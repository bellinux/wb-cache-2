5000|$|Krahe {{writes in}} A1, chapter III, [...] "Introducing preface" [...] Number 2 {{that the old}} European <b>hydronomy</b> {{extended}} from Scandinavia to South Italy, from Western Europe including the British Isles to the Baltic countries. Of the three Mediterranean peninsulas, Italy was most completely included, whilst the Balkan Peninsula was only scarcely covered. He writes that what he presents for <b>hydronomy</b> also applies to mountains and ranges of mountains, and continues with [...] "Karpaten" [...] and [...] "Karawanken", certainly within the Slavic settlement area, omitting the Bavarian/Austrian [...] "Karwendel" [...] though. This area {{is associated with the}} spread of the later [...] "Western" [...] Indo-European dialects, the Celtic, Italic, Germanic, Baltic, and Illyrian branches. Notably exempt is Greece.|$|E
5000|$|In III A 2, [...] "Etymology and Semasiology of the paleoeuropean river names" [...] Krahe {{states that}} the oldest strata are {{composed}} by prerequisites of nature and that the river names especially refer to the water itself (rule 2), and that words referring to humans and culture are newer. Both rules are important arguments for considering the old European <b>hydronomy</b> of southern France and {{the north of the}} Iberian Peninsula as a result of secondary implementation (A.1. number 3) due to a postulated immigration around 1300 BC.|$|E
5000|$|In Hans Krahe's {{system of}} Old European <b>hydronomy,</b> the old {{name for the}} Aller, Alara, {{is an example of}} a group of river names with the root al- that is very common over much of Europe and {{according}} to Krahe all go back to the Indo-European root *el-/*ol-, which means [...] "flowing". Similarly related would be rivers such as the Alster, Iller, Elz or Ilmenau. Krahe's hypothesis is, however, hotly disputed in language circles. Theo Vennemann used a modified version of Krahe's model in his Vasconic substratum theory.|$|E

For example, history professor Kenneth H. Jackson identified a river-name pattern against which to fit {{the story of the}} Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain and pockets of surviving native British culture. His river map of Britain divided the island into three principal areas of English settlement: the river valleys draining eastward in which surviving British names are limited to the largest rivers and Saxon settlement was early and dense; the highland spine; and a third region whose British hydronyms apply even to the smaller streams.|$|E
40|$|Our work treats {{onomastics}} in {{the lower}} part of the Adour river broadly speaking in the Bayonne region and is based, in particular, on thousands of notaries' minutes which are so far very often unexploited; i. e. it notably encompasses sciences such as toponymy in rural areas or towns, anthroponymy, <b>hydronomy</b> and oronymy of one part of the littoral section of the Labourd province at a transition period, the XVIIIth century, mainly marked by the decline of the popular Basque culture and in towns by tremendous upheavals that will spread headlong to the whole region of Bayonne-Anglet-Biarritz during the XIXth and the XXeth centuries. L'examen de plus de 10 000 minutes notariales labourdines et inédites du XVIIIe siècle permet de se faire une idée relativement exacte de la situation onomastique qui était celle de la région de Bayonne à l'époque...|$|E
40|$|The {{prehistory}} and {{the early}} history of Nepal are largely unknown - certainly, as far as the major part of the country is concerned, because it is not situated closely enough to such early cultural and political centers such as Kapilavastu, or medieval ones such as the Kathmandu Valley, Tibet, Chamba or Jumla. Nor can we expect, except from future extensive archaeological surveys, more information for those areas that have not left us with written documentation. In this situation, it may be useful to try to elicit more information not only from the "unwritten history" contained in legends etc., but also from language itself, where such information can be found in an "undiluted" state. For changes in language occur, as is well known, mostly unconsciously and over a period of many years and they are, for the greater part, not directly influenced by official policy or by individual habits. It is well known that place names such as those of streams, rivers, localities, and mountains often are very persistent. This especially applies to names of rivers. In Europe, for example, where such names have been studied in great detail, river names were found to reflect, quite frequently, the languages spoken before the influx of the Indo-European speaking populations. They thus are older, dependent on the date of the spread of Indo-European languages in the various parts of Europe, than c. 4500 to 2500 B. C. It would be fascinating to gain a similar vantage point for the prehistory of Nepal. A toponymical study of Nepal is bound to provide some insight into the settlement patterns of the present and past populations of the area. Such an attempt has not yet appeared though some authors have hinted at the desirability of such an undertaking. In the following pages, I will limit myself to the names of the rivers of the Nepalese Himalayas, to <b>hydronomy,</b> as such names seem to be more conservative than those of settlements (and easier to explore than for example those of local fields or mountains. ...|$|E
