500|$|Rihanna {{explained}} {{that she wanted to}} keep the audience dancing and be soulful at the same time. She sought to make an album that people would listen to without skipping tracks. She cited Afrodisiac (2004), the fourth studio album by American singer Brandy Norwood, as her main inspiration for the album. In May 2007, Rihanna revealed that she called the album Good Girl Gone Bad because it represents her bolder and more independent image: [...] "I'm not the innocent Rihanna anymore. I'm taking a lot more risks and chances. I felt when <b>I</b> <b>cut</b> <b>my</b> hair, it shows people I'm not trying to look or be anybody else. The album is very edgy." ...|$|E
500|$|Taylor {{withstood}} {{a tremendous}} amount of punishment throughout the game. At one point in the first quarter, he bit his tongue while being tackled by Huff, causing him to swallow blood {{for the rest of the}} game. He also required six stitches at halftime to close a gash on his elbow. Some players wondered if he could even play in the second half. [...] "Taylor isn't human," [...] said Huff. [...] "No human being could have taken the punishment he got today." [...] Taylor described the contest in the locker room after the game, saying, [...] "I never took a worse beating on a football field. The Giants hit me hard, and then I hit the ground hard. I got it both ways. This was the toughest game I've ever played ... I just rammed it down their throats by letting my running do my talking. They couldn't rattle me ... I think Huff hit me with his elbow after a tackle. Anyway, <b>I</b> <b>cut</b> <b>my</b> tongue of all things." [...] Additionally, Taylor was playing while sick; two weeks later, he learned he had hepatitis, which contributed to his 15-pound weight loss prior to the game.|$|E

6000|$|... "But my {{market value}} {{is about a}} pound a week," [...] he concluded, ruefully, [...] "so <b>I</b> must <b>cut</b> <b>my</b> coat to suit my cloth. Good-night." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{explained}} that I wanted no more weight; and for no donkey hitherto created would <b>I</b> <b>cut</b> <b>my</b> sleeping-bag in two.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I did that, sir,' said a great lubberly fellow, {{stepping}} forward; 'and preciously <b>I</b> <b>cut</b> <b>my</b> knuckle agin' his mouth. I stopped him, sir.' ...|$|E
60|$|We loaded hastily, but not quickly. Our {{guns were}} muzzle-loaders, and rain does not {{facilitate}} loading. In {{trying to force}} a bullet down, my ramrod slipped, and <b>I</b> <b>cut</b> <b>my</b> knuckles severely.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Señorita {{would be}} sorry {{if you came}} home limping. Once or twice <b>I</b> have <b>cut</b> <b>my</b> hand with the chopper, and she was kind to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But," [...] added Philip, with {{a little}} laugh, [...] "I don't pretend that he has taken a fancy to you, and, if I were you, <b>I</b> should <b>cut</b> <b>my</b> visit short." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, no,' {{said the}} young man, shaking his head. 'Much worse. It {{is the most}} infernal business; I {{do not know what}} I shall do. I think <b>I</b> shall <b>cut</b> <b>my</b> throat.' ...|$|R
60|$|SOLDIER. The {{citizens}} rose {{against us}} when the army entered the gates. I was with two {{others in the}} market place when the news came. They set upon us. <b>I</b> <b>cut</b> <b>my</b> way out; and here I am.|$|E
6000|$|... "Contractors of Queen Anne: {{partners}} with Marlborough and Solomon Medina; {{a very good}} family indeed: but I do not make peers out of good families, Sir Vavasour; old families are the blocks out of which <b>I</b> <b>cut</b> <b>my</b> Mercurys." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Confound Ezra Graves, {{and wait}} till I have done, can't you," [...] {{interrupted}} the first citizen, angrily. [...] "What {{do you mean}} by putting a bath-tub into my house with the tin loose, so that <b>I</b> <b>cut</b> <b>my</b> leg on it?" ...|$|E
60|$|GUNNER. <b>I</b> would <b>cut</b> <b>my</b> {{tongue out}} sooner than say {{anything}} vulgar in your presence; for I regard you {{with respect and}} affection. I was not swearing. I was affirming my manhood.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know, Miss Hannay," [...] Wilson said quietly, [...] "what my {{fighting}} powers are, but I fancy if {{you were}} clinging to me <b>I</b> could <b>cut</b> <b>my</b> way through a good deal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I tell you, Phoenician," [...] {{answered}} Aziel, [...] "that {{rather than}} suffer that luckless {{child to be}} butchered before <b>my</b> eyes <b>I</b> will <b>cut</b> <b>my</b> way to it with my guards, and rescue it alive." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Can I {{live to be}} mistrusted?' cried her husband. 'Have <b>I</b> <b>cut</b> <b>my</b> heart into a demd {{extraordinary}} {{number of}} little pieces, and given them all away, one after another, to the same little engrossing demnition captivater, and can I live to be suspected by her? Demmit, no I can't.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Scarcely ever. One gets tired after business, and you can't get the books. I {{have been}} to some {{extension}} lectures, of course, 'Lizabethan Dramatists,' it was, but it seemed a little high-flown, you know. And I went and did wood-carving at the same place. But it didn't seem leading nowhere, and <b>I</b> <b>cut</b> <b>my</b> thumb and chucked it." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{knew that}} action {{would give a}} turn to his mood. He never liked to see me mend pens; my knife was always dull-edged--my hand, too, was unskilful; I hacked and chipped. On this {{occasion}} <b>I</b> <b>cut</b> <b>my</b> own finger--half on purpose. I wanted to restore him to his natural state, to set him at his ease, {{to get him to}} chide.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{although}} I has a likin' for you, old man," [...] {{replied the}} sailor, [...] "I can't but feel a sort o' preference, d'ee see, {{for my own}} wife an' child'n. Therefore <b>I</b> would <b>cut</b> <b>my</b> cable, if <b>I</b> had the chance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; I do not," [...] he said. [...] "I {{have always}} disliked it. It {{amounts to a}} prejudice, I dare say. But if I were made to live here I am {{convinced}} <b>I</b> should <b>cut</b> <b>my</b> throat {{in the first six}} months." ...|$|R

6000|$|... '"No! I've formed my resolution, and by God I'll execute it!" [...] {{cried the}} desperate being. [...] "I'll do you a {{kindness}} {{in spite of}} yourself, and Hareton justice! And you needn't trouble your head to screen me; Catherine is gone. Nobody alive would regret me, or be ashamed, though <b>I</b> <b>cut</b> <b>my</b> throat this minute--and it's time to make an end!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{all this}} is rot and nonsense," [...] said Ralph the heir, {{brushing}} the tears away from his eyes, [...] "and I am only making an ass of myself. Your father wants to know whether I will sell the reversion to Newton Priory. I will. I find I must. I don't know whether I wouldn't sooner cut my throat; but unless <b>I</b> <b>cut</b> <b>my</b> throat I must sell it. I had a means of escape, but that has gone by. When I wrote that letter there was a means of escape. Now there's none." ...|$|E
60|$|I have myself found {{hundreds}} of arrow-heads {{made of the}} same material. It is generally slate-colored, with white specks, becoming a uniform white where exposed to the light and air. I picked up a small thin piece which had so sharp an edge that I {{used it as a}} knife, and, to see what I could do, fairly cut off an aspen one inch thick with it, by bending it and making many cuts; though <b>I</b> <b>cut</b> <b>my</b> fingers badly with the back of it in the meanwhile.|$|E
60|$|Nothing loath, I {{seized the}} Indian {{by the long}} scalp-lock, while my big friend guided my hand, and amid {{laughter}} and cheers <b>I</b> <b>cut</b> off <b>my</b> first trophy of war. Nor did I have any other feeling than fierce hatred of the race which had killed my father.|$|R
2500|$|She {{struggled}} {{for a number}} of years, working briefly as a bike messenger in Boston. She has described herself thus: [...] "I guess I just prefer to see the dark side of things. The glass is always half empty. And cracked. And <b>I</b> just <b>cut</b> <b>my</b> lip on it. And chipped a tooth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} this morning," [...] he said, [...] "I am going down now to breakfast. I {{have had a}} few little {{accidents}} {{with some of the}} things in the room and <b>I</b> have <b>cut</b> <b>my</b> hand. <b>I</b> want you to tell the manager and see that they are properly charged for on the bill.... Thank you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Mary applied {{herself to}} the mouth of the kettle, and between indraws of steam said: [...] "The spasm came on just now, while I was asleep. I was nearly choking to death. So I went to the window I've done it often before, without, waking any one. Bessie's such an old maid about draughts. I tell you I was choking to death. I couldn't manage the catch, and I nearly fell out. That window opens too low. <b>I</b> <b>cut</b> <b>my</b> hand trying to save myself. Who has tied it up in this filthy handkerchief? I wish you had had my throat, Bessie. I never was nearer dying!" [...] She scowled on us all impartially, while her sister sobbed.|$|E
60|$|They {{were the}} family of William, one of our club waiters who had been disappointing me grievously of late. Many a time have I {{deferred}} dining several minutes that I might have the attendance of this ingrate. His efforts to reserve the window-table for me were satisfactory, and I used to allow him privileges, as to suggest dishes; I have given him information, as that someone had startled me in the reading-room by slamming a door; I have shown him how <b>I</b> <b>cut</b> <b>my</b> finger {{with a piece of}} string. William was none of your assertive waiters. We could have plotted a murder safely before him. It was one member who said to him that Saucy Sarah would win the Derby and another who said that Saucy Sarah had no chance, but it was William who agreed with both. The excellent fellow (as I thought him) was like a cheroot which may be smoked from either end.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Nay, I {{should have}} {{grounded}} on my beef bones had I waited longer at my moorings. <b>I</b> <b>cut</b> <b>my</b> cable, therefore, and, making a northerly tack {{as far as}} Salisbury, I run down with a fair wind. Thy father hath set his face hard, and goes about his work as usual, though much troubled by the Justices, who have twice had him up to Winchester for examination, but have found his papers all right and no charge to be brought against him. Your mother, poor soul, hath little time to mope or to pipe her eye, for she hath such {{a sense of duty}} that, were the ship to founder under her, it is a plate galleon to a china orange that she would stand fast in the caboose curing marigolds or rolling pastry. They have taken to prayer as some would to rum, and warm their hearts with it when the wind of misfortune blows chill. They were right glad that I should come down to you, and I gave them the word of a sailor that I would get you out of the bilboes if it might anyhow be done.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I drugged you, Allan, then <b>I</b> <b>cut</b> off <b>my</b> {{hair and}} dressed myself in your clothes. The Vrouw Prinsloo, Hans and I set my {{garments}} upon you. They led you out {{as though you}} were fainting, and the guards, seeing me, whom they thought was you, standing in the doorway, let them pass without question.|$|R
6000|$|... "I! <b>I</b> <b>cut</b> one of <b>my</b> {{very best}} friends! How can she say {{anything}} so untrue? If I {{knew where she}} lived I'd go and pay her a visit after dinner." ...|$|R
6000|$|At last Ingleby {{turned to}} her. [...] "Hetty," [...] he said quietly, [...] "I don't {{think you could}} {{understand}} how much you have done for me. <b>I</b> would sooner <b>cut</b> <b>my</b> hand off than let the claim go." ...|$|R
