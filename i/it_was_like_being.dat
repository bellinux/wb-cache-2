5|$|I {{had gone}} to Puerto Rico and was {{influenced}} by Latin music at that moment. When I came back, the melody was in my head. It was at a melancholy {{point in my life}} and the song reflects the yearning that was going on inside of me. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> in a situation but you want to break free and you can't, so your confined yet you're releasing those emotion through the lyrics and the actual act of singing. Thats why {{think a lot of people}} felt very strongly about that song, because the emotion is clear when you listen to it.|$|E

I hung out {{with a lot of}} rock stars but no one ever did that to the same extent. There was just an ease to the whole thing. They really were the kindest, most fun band I ever worked with." ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{departure}} from industry practice, Radiohead conducted no interviews and did not tour before the release of A Moon Shaped Pool. On 30 April 2016, days before the album was announced, fans who had previously made orders from Radiohead received embossed cards with lyrics from the album's lead single, [...] "Burn the Witch". On 1 May, Radiohead deleted all content from their website and social media profiles, replacing them with blank images. Donwood said the idea had been [...] "a way {{of getting rid of}} all of [...] had gone before ... <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> some sort of evil Bond villain or something, in some lair, pressing buttons ... It was creatively brilliant fun." [...] Pitchfork interpreted the move as symbolic of Radiohead's re-emergence.|$|E

500|$|When {{playing for}} Bermuda, Goater {{was often the}} only {{professional}} player in the team. Bermudian journalist Chris Gibbons described the difference between Goater and his teammates: [...] "He's a class above every other player on the island. Before he went to England he was just quick, but now he's a totally different player, a lot more aggressive and a much better header of the ball. The problem has been that he sets up chances for the others without them being on the same wavelength." [...] However, Goater noted that this had a detrimental aspect: [...] "My fitness dropped off while I was with Bermuda. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> on holiday. The team just ate what they liked. I kept to my professional diet for {{about two or three}} weeks until peer pressure took over." ...|$|E

I've been so low {{budget for}} so long, and to have this {{incredibly}} amazing video was really very humbling. It was really fun, but you'll see if you ever come to a video shoot of mine one day– I'm very private about those things, I don't really talk to everybody. I'm not like the party girl running around. I might even {{seem to be a}} bit of a diva. I'm sort of with myself, in my work head space worrying about costumes, and if extras look right, and placement. I don't just show up for things, you know. That video was a vision of mine. It was Melina the director who wanted to do something, to have a performance art aspect that was so pop but it was still commercial, but that felt like lifestyle. It was all those things, I love it." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{recalled}} later: [...] "He {{positioned himself}} {{off to one}} side of-and some distance away from-the last Il-2 in a formation of six. He then turned in quickly and opened fire at the enemy's cockpit from an angle of some 30 degrees. The Il-2 immediately burst into flames and crashed. 'Do you see how it's done?', Oberst Mölders' voice came over the R/T. 'Right, now you take the next one.' I carried out the same manoeuvre and, sure enough, the next Il-2 went down on fire. 'And again!' <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> on a training flight. Another short burst and the third Il-2 was ablaze. The whole lesson had lasted no more than 12 minutes!" [...] In this way, Kaiser scored his 23rd and 24th kills. But because Mölders was officially banned from operational flying, the first Soviet aircraft was never officially credited to him. Within the next two months, it is speculated that Mölders unofficially shot down around another 30 Soviet aircraft. At least six of Mölders' unofficial victories are recorded in his fellow pilots' private log books.|$|E

2500|$|Bryan Fuller {{left early}} Season 1 because of {{conflicts}} with MGM Television, including disagreement over major script and storyline cuts considered {{important to the}} main theme. He stated that the [...] "lack of professionalism... made it really difficult... <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> at war... they were constantly trying to strong arm me. It was the worst experience of my life". According to Fuller, Showtime canceled the show due to [...] "a loss of quality and a sense the problems would continue." [...] Actress Rebecca Gayheart also departed the show after the series' fifth episode.|$|E
2500|$|The humors can {{be found}} in Elizabethan works, such as in Taming of the Shrew, in which the {{character}} Petruchio pretends to be irritable and angry to show Katherina what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> around a disagreeable person. He yells at the servants for serving mutton, a [...] "choleric" [...] food, to two people who are already choleric.|$|R

60|$|This, {{she took}} <b>it,</b> <b>was</b> a fair sample {{of what she}} might expect after marriage.

2500|$|Santana {{moved to}} San Francisco and, in October 1966, started the Santana Blues Band.

2500|$|While {{acknowledging}} {{that the differences}} between women are wide and varied, most of Lorde's works are concerned with two subsets that concerned her primarily—race and sexuality. In Ada Gay Griffin and Michelle Parkerson's documentary A Litany for Survival: The Life and Work of Audre Lorde, Lorde says, [...] "Let me tell you first about what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> a Black woman poet in the '60s, from jump. It meant being invisible. It meant being really invisible. It meant being doubly invisible as a Black feminist woman and it meant being triply invisible as a Black lesbian and feminist".|$|E
2500|$|It was {{produced}} by hip-hop producer Swizz Beatz with an old school R beat. Beatz told MTV News that the process on the song started {{when he got a}} call from Clive Davis and record executive Larry Jackson. After he had produced the beat, Keys joined him in the songwriting process and the duo completed the song. Keys told Billboard about the recording session(s), [...] "Whitney is an artist who inspired me from [...] a little girl. Fast-forwarding to now and being able to work with her to help create this song that took off was fun. We had a lot of laughs; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> with a long-lost friend." ...|$|E

I'm an only child, so I grew up as my father's son and mother's daughter. I was quite a jock. I played baseball, basketball—I think that background made Vince and I very compatible. I really {{have a very good}} understanding of the male psyche—I'm very comfortable in a guy environment. I have {{to say that there are}} very strong women in this company as well. Our human resources division and our consumer goods division are headed by women—It's still a testosterone business, and I like it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Written in 17 {{days in a}} {{deck chair}} on Morecambe pier where Osborne was {{performing}} in a creaky rep show called Seagulls over Sorrento, Look Back in Anger was largely autobiographical, based on his time living, and arguing, with Pamela Lane in cramped accommodation in Derby while she cuckolded him with a local dentist. It was submitted to agents all over London and returned with great rapidity. In his autobiography, Osborne writes: [...] "The {{speed with which it}} had been returned was not surprising, but its aggressive dispatch did give me a kind of relief. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> grasped at the upper arm by a testy policeman and told to move on". Finally it was sent to the newly formed English Stage Company at London's Royal Court Theatre.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{participants}} {{said they}} felt the March was a historic and life-changing experience. Nan Grogan Orrock, a student at Mary Washington College, said: [...] "You couldn't help but get {{swept up in the}} feeling of the March. It was an incredible experience of this mass of humanity with one mind moving down the street. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> part of a glacier. You could feel the sense of collective will and effort in the air." [...] SNCC organizer Bob Zellner reported that the event [...] "provided dramatic proof that the sometimes quiet and always dangerous work we did in the Deep South had had a profound national impact. The spectacle of {{a quarter of a million}} supporters and activists gave me an assurance that the work I was in the process of dedicating my life to was worth doing." ...|$|E

2500|$|To date, {{there is}} no {{successful}} method of treatment that [...] "cures" [...] musical hallucinations. There have been successful therapies in single cases that have ameliorated the hallucinations. Some of these successes include drugs such as neuroleptics, antidepressants, and certain anticonvulsive drugs. A musical hallucination was alleviated, for example, by antidepressant medications given to patients with depression. Sanchez reported that some authors {{have suggested that the}} use of hearing aids may improve musical hallucination symptoms. They believed that the external environment influences the auditory hallucinations, showing worsening of symptoms in quieter environments than in noisier ones. Oliver Sacks' patient, Mrs. O'C, reported being in an [...] "ocean of sound" [...] despite being in a quiet room due to a small thrombosis or infarction in her right temporal lobe. After treatment, Mrs. O'C was relinquished of her musical experience but said that, [...] "I do miss the old songs. Now, with lots of them, I can't even recall them. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>being</b> given back a forgotten bit of my childhood again." [...] Sacks also reported another elderly woman, Mrs. O'M, who had a mild case of deafness and reported hearing musical pieces. When she was treated with anticonvulsive medications, her musical hallucinations ceased but when asked if she missed them, she said [...] "Not on your life." ...|$|E

50|$|Live bidding is a {{traditional}} room-based auction. These can be broadcast via a website where viewers can hear live audio and see live video feeds.

Timed bidding, on the other hand, is a separate auction altogether, which allows bidders to participate without the need to see or hear the live event. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> another way of bidding, that is more convenient to the bidder.|$|R
