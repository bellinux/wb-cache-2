40|$|Objectives: To {{estimate}} {{the number of}} men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with {{men and women who are}} HIV-positive in the United States, and to compare HIV prevalence rates between men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with men and women, men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with men only, and men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with women exclusively. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of reports referencing HIV prevalence and men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with men and women. We searched PubMed and Ovid PsycINFO for peer-reviewed, U. S. -based articles reporting on HIV prevalence among men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with men and women. We conducted event rate, effect size, moderation and sensitivity analyses. Results: We estimate that 1. 0 % of U. S. males are bisexually-behaving, and that 121, 800 bisexually-behaving men are HIV-positive. Men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with men and women are less than half as likely to be HIV-positive as men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with men only (16. 9 % vs. 33. 3 %; OR = 0. 41, 95 % CI: 0. 31, 0. 54), but more than five times as likely to be HIV-positive as men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with women exclusively (18. 3 % vs. 3. 5 %; OR = 5. 71, 95 % CI: 3. 47, 9. 39). They are less likely to engage in unprotected receptive anal intercourse than men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with men only (15. 9 % vs. 35. 0 %; OR = 0. 36, 95 % CI: 0. 28, 0. 46). Men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with men and women in samples with high racial/ethnic minority proportions had significantly higher HIV prevalence than their counterparts in low racial/ethnic minority samples. Conclusions: This represents the first meta-analysis of HIV prevalence in the U. S. between men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with men and women and men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with men only. Data collection, research, and HIV prevention and care delivery specifically tailored to men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with men and women are necessary to better quantify and ameliorate this population's HIV burden. © 2014 Friedman et al...|$|R

40|$|Background: Several {{studies have}} shown there has been {{significant}} {{lack of knowledge about}} women who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with women cross infect each other with STIs. It has been less likely that women who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with women visit health care than heterosexuals, they often felt badly treated, invisible and did not always know where to turn in case of an STI. Objective: The objective was to examine if STI information from Kalmar and Växjö county websites and GCK-summit, targeted women who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with women. Method: With a queer theoretical perspective a critical discourse analysis was made by STI information on the internet. Results: Women who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with women <b>have</b> been excluded in the STI information currently available through Kalmar and Växjö county websites. The public notices for screening tests have not been designed in such way it includes women who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with women. Women who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with women <b>have</b> been an obscure group. Conclusion: The conclusion was that women who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with women <b>have</b> not been included in the STI information available on the internet within the county councils of Kalmar and Kronoberg...|$|R
40|$|Aims and {{objectives}} To explore men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with men's views about condom use when having anal intercourse. Background Internationally, health promotion campaigns use behavioural change strategies to support men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with men to always use condoms when <b>having</b> anal <b>sex</b> with other men. The health promotion message given {{to this group}} is consistent and explicitly stated that ‘use a condom every time for anal sex regardless of relationship status’. Design Qualitative analysis of data from a cohort of New Zealand men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with men. Methods A total of 960 useable questionnaires were completed: 571 online and 389 in hard copy. Qualitative data were analysed using a thematic data analytic process. Results Three themes relating to condom use in men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with men were identified. These are as follows: ‘Safer sex is good sex’, ‘Condom use is good but …’ and ‘I use condoms sometimes’. Conclusions The range of responses towards condom use for anal sex in men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with men in our sample reveal this as a complex public health issue, with not all men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with men willing to consistently use condoms. Relevance to clinical practice It is important that nurses do not assume that all men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with men are willing to use condoms for anal sex, and should create opportunities for men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with men to raise any concerns {{about the use of}} condoms. In this way, nurses can assist in providing information that may help men who <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> with men to make decisions that will minimise risk of contracting infections associated with sexual activity...|$|R
