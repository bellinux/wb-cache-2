40|$|This paper reviews energy {{utilisation}} in <b>high</b> <b>yielding</b> Holsteins and {{draws attention to}} the competing forces within the cow for nutrients to support different physiological processes. These comprise; meeting obligatory maintenance costs, providing essential nutrients for milk synthesis, maintenance of satisfactory milk composition, regulation of body tissue metabolism and body condition score and the establishment of reproductive cyclity after calving, followed by a successful pregnancy. Interrelationships between nutritional state and the partition of nutrients to these competing forces is discussed, with emphasis on the fertility of <b>high</b> <b>yielding</b> multiparous cows, aiming to determine the origins of some of the abnormal cycles and compromised fertility noted in such cows. A further analysis with primaparous heifers is provided and finally a number of strategies are identified that could be undertaken, to improve nutritional state and the overall fertility of <b>high</b> <b>yielding</b> cows. It is concluded that development of improved nutritional strategies represents a more reliable means of improving the overall productivity, along with the fertility of <b>high</b> <b>yielding</b> cows, than an increased focus on genetic selection, where predictability of response has often been disappointing...|$|R
40|$|Stability {{of protein}} and oil content of 13 soybean {{varieties}} were examined using linear model across seven locations and during six years. Due to heterogeneity of environments all year/locations was distributed in to two groups, based on achieved yield. Stability of protein content differed {{in the low}} and <b>high</b> <b>yielding</b> environments, while average values show only minor differences. In contrast, oil content stability was slightly changed in the low and <b>high</b> <b>yielding</b> environments, while the average oil content were significantly higher in the low yielding environments. Environmental factors influenced the correlation between oil and protein content in soybeans. Negative correlation between protein and oil content was observed only in the <b>high</b> <b>yielding</b> environments, while varieties in low yielding environments lack this well known inverse relation...|$|R

40|$|Relationships between leaf {{photosynthesis}} and yield {{have not}} been well defined in forage grasses. Therefore, leaf growth, dry matter distribution, carbohydrate concentration, and growth analysis of four genotypes of tall fescue (Festuca mundinacea Schreb.) were examined. Genotypes, selected {{in the field for}} high and low CO 2 exchange rate (CER) in combination with high and low yield, were compared in an attempt to study the relationship between photosynthesis and yield. In the vegetative growth stage, <b>high</b> <b>yielding</b> genotypes produced greater amounts of all plant parts (leaves, stem bases, and roots) than did low yielding genotypes; however, low yielding genotypes produced more leaf tissue relative to total increase in plant dry weight than did <b>high</b> <b>yielding</b> genotypes. Water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC) concentrations of plant parts were significantly different among genotypes, with high-CER genotypes having highest levels during early stages of regrowth. <b>High</b> <b>yielding</b> genotypes had <b>highest</b> WSC concentrations at later stages regardless of CER rating. Mean relative growth rates of the four genotypes were similar. Mean net assimilation rates and mean relative leaf area growth rates tended to be greater for the <b>high</b> <b>yielding</b> genotypes than for the low yielding genotypes. Results indicated the greater yields exhibited by the <b>high</b> <b>yielding</b> genotypes regardless of CER rating resulted from (1) greater carbohydrate reserves to initiate new leaf growth, (2) more rapid leaf area development, and (3) partitioning a greater amount of newly assimilated dry matter into leaf tissue during the first 16 to 19 days of regrowth...|$|R
