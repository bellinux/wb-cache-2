5|$|Edward Hack {{developed}} {{the original idea}} and model of lemon juice being contained inside lemon-shaped and coloured packaging in the 1950s. The product was then designed and produced by Cascelloid Ltd. Hack presented Cascelloid with a <b>fresh</b> <b>lemon</b> he acquired at Covent Garden, upon which to base the plastic container. Hack had performed significant searches at several markets to find an optimal model. Cascelloid stated that Hack reviewed and evaluated the entire inventory of lemons at Fortnum and Mason’s, Selfridges, Harrods and Covent Garden, the latter of which involved examining three cases of lemons that contained around 300 lemons in each case.|$|E
5|$|The Jif plastic {{containers}} were originally made from polythene, and {{were one of}} the original and first blow moulded containers used for food applications. The {{plastic containers}} served to replace glass bottles used to package lemon juice. The plastic container was the brainchild of Edward Hack, and the container's design was undertaken by Bill Pugh, the chief plastics designer at Cascelloid. In its development, Pugh carved a core made of wood, covered it with <b>fresh</b> <b>lemon</b> peel to give it a realistic texture, and then cast a plaster mould. This led to the realistic-looking container that significantly resembles a lemon.|$|E

This was followed by their first EP, Four <b>Fresh</b> <b>Lemons</b> in August 1982, the 1,000 pressings selling out in just five days. The New Zealand release of Six <b>Fresh</b> <b>Lemons,</b> combined Four <b>Fresh</b> <b>Lemons</b> with the A & B sides of their first single. These recordings were released under the name Spy vs Spy, but the band was forced to change its name to v. Spy v. Spy to avoid legal action from the publishers of Mad magazine, which included the comic strip [...] "Spy vs. Spy". Their music became more straight forward hard rock for their pub audiences.|$|R

He played in a New South Wales game despite having a cold.|$|E

500|$|St Vincent's {{skills as}} an {{administrator}} and logistician {{came into play}} and he issued orders regarding the health and well being of the fleet. St Vincent wrote to Earl Spencer, commenting [...] "I have ever considered {{the care of the}} sick and wounded {{as one of the first}} duties of a Commander-in-chief, by sea or land." [...] Based on Doctor Baird's advice on cleanliness and hygiene the admiral brought in as many fresh vegetables as he could, along with vast quantities of <b>fresh</b> <b>lemon</b> juice to minimise illness, particularly scurvy. The effect was dramatic. The hospital ship that accompanied the fleet was sent home unneeded and in November 1800 when the fleet came to anchor in Torbay there were as few as sixteen hospital cases among the estimated twenty three thousand men. In a letter to Sir Evan Nepean, first secretary to the Admiralty, St Vincent described Baird as [...] "the most valuable man in the Navy not excepting the Board itself," [...] The oncoming winter of 1800–1801 forced the admiral to live ashore at Torre Abbey overlooking Torbay. Vice-Admiral Sir Henry Harvey took over operational command of the fleet in St Vincent's absence.|$|E

2500|$|Citric acid can {{be added}} to ice cream as an {{emulsifying}} agent to keep fats from separating, to caramel to prevent sucrose crystallization, or in recipes in place of <b>fresh</b> <b>lemon</b> juice. Citric acid is used with sodium bicarbonate {{in a wide range of}} effervescent formulae, both for ingestion (e.g., powders and tablets) and for personal care (e.g., bath salts, bath bombs, and cleaning of grease). Citric acid sold in a dry powdered form is commonly sold in markets and groceries as [...] "sour salt", due to its physical resemblance to table salt. It has use in culinary applications, as an alternative to vinegar or lemon juice, where a pure acid is needed.|$|E

500|$|Jif is {{sometimes}} used on pancakes. An advertising campaign introduced the catch-phrase [...] "Don't forget the pancakes on Jif lemon day," [...] {{in reference to}} Shrove Tuesday, which is {{also referred to as}} Pancake Day. The campaign and slogan was devised by Reckitt and Colman. The Jif lemon-shaped packaging aligned Jif with the consumption of pancakes on Shrove Tuesday in consumers' minds, creating a strong link between the product and Shrove Tuesday. Jif and pancakes is a popular combination on Shrove Tuesday. In 2000, over 80,000 Jif lemons were being produced per day to meet consumer demand for Pancake Day, beginning five weeks prior to Pancake Day. This occurred despite <b>fresh</b> <b>lemons</b> having greater availability during this time compared to other time periods.|$|R

40|$|Msayer is a dry salted lemon {{used as an}} aromatising {{condiment}} in many North-African food recipes. This {{preparation is}} obtained by adding coarse salt (10 g/ 100 g <b>fresh</b> <b>lemons)</b> to <b>fresh</b> cut <b>lemons</b> in containers kept under dark conditions away from air for around {{a month and a}} half A survey of 52 days showed low initial uptake of citric acid and sugars from the formed liquid phase. Nevertheless, there were still sugars detected even at the end of the survey attesting for the low microbial activity as also shown by carbon dioxide production and microbial viable counts. Indeed, the microbial counts showed a steady decrease reaching 2 log units at the 52 nd day of curing. Moulds were detected only at the beginning but at low numbers. No viable counts of lactic acid bacteria were observed on MRS medium despite detection of lactic acid (8 g/l). In contrast, yeasts seem to dominate in the msayer preparation. They count for almost all the microbial population especially after the first week. Six of these acid and halotolerant yeast isolates were identified, by sequence analysis of the amplified 5. 8 S rRNA and the two internal transcribed spacer regions, as Candida parapsislosis (2 isolates) and unclassified Saccharomycetales (4 isolates).
