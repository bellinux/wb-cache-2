5|$|Around 52 {{minutes and}} 47 seconds into the film, when Shatner {{is talking about}} the other Original Series actors disliking him, <b>he</b> <b>shifts</b> in his chair and a sound evocative of {{flatulence}} is audible. This sound, apparently unnoticed by the filmmakers, was first mentioned in the media by Adam Buckman in the New York Post on October 10, 2001. Buckman wrote that he played the sound for more than six colleagues who all agreed that it came from Shatner. This scene became a popular subject of flatulence humor among Star Trek fans and on morning zoo radio programs. Reviewers identified as many as six other similar noises in Mind Meld, between the 52-minute mark and the end.|$|E

[...] MTV commented that it took Ocean [...] "some time to warm up to the crowd" [...] at his debut New Orleans performance, though they noted the performance started the tour to a [...] "promising start". MTV later {{reviewed the}} New York performance on the 27th and called Ocean [...] "an audience charmer". The New York Times critic Jon Caramanica gave a positive review to the same New York performance, calling Ocean a [...] "versatile singer" [...] and writing that [...] "in his elegant, savvy, slightly crooked postsoul, <b>he</b> <b>shifts</b> sneakily between the two topics, singing about love as a byproduct of music and using the subject of music to dig deep about love." ...|$|E

Los Angeles Times writer Todd Martens wrote favorably of B.o.B's [...] "middle-class tales", stating [...] "at his best, [...] channels {{the spirit of a}} young Kanye West". Nathan Rabin of The A.V.

[...] Brunn lies northeast of Friedrich, while in Znaim, some fifty miles; the Saxon head-quarter is at Kromau, midway towards that City.

60|$|Again {{and again}} his shield {{is full of}} darts. Without moving a foot, without turning an inch right or left, says Procopius, he catches another from his shield-bearer, and fights on. At last he has twelve lances in his shield, and cannot move it: coolly he calls for a fresh one, {{as if he were}} fixed to the soil, thrusts back the enemy with his left hand, and stabs at them with his right. But his time is come. As <b>he</b> <b>shifts</b> his shield for a moment his chest is exposed, and a javelin is through him. And so ends the last hero of the East Goths. They put his head upon a pole, and carry it round the lines to frighten the Goths. The Goths are long past frightening.|$|E
60|$|The long {{stocking}} caps {{they wear}} {{as a sort}} of crest, as a lizard wears his crest at mating time. They are always moving them, settling them on their heads. One fat fellow, young, with sly brown eyes and a young beard round his face folds his stocking-foot in three, so that it rises over his brow martial and handsome. The old boy brings his stocking-foot over the left ear. A handsome fellow with a jaw of massive teeth pushes his cap back and lets it hang a long way down his back. Then <b>he</b> <b>shifts</b> it forward over his nose, and makes it have two sticking-out points, like fox-ears, above his temples. It is marvellous how much expression these caps can take on. They say that only those born to them can wear them. They seem to be just long bags, nearly a yard long, of black stockinette stuff.|$|E

6000|$|In the Senate of the United States, in 1850, Judge Trumbull, in {{a speech}} substantially, if not directly, put the same interrogatory to Judge Douglas, {{as to whether the}} people of a Territory had the lawful power to exclude slavery prior to the {{formation}} of a constitution. Judge Douglas then answered at considerable length, and his answer will be found in the Congressional Globe, under date of June 9th, 1856. The Judge said that whether the people could exclude slavery prior to the formation of a constitution or not was a question to be decided by the Supreme Court. He put that proposition, as will be seen by the Congressional Globe, in a variety of forms, all running to the same thing in substance,--that it was a question for the Supreme Court.

6000|$|Another one of {{the points}} Judge Douglas makes upon Judge Trumbull is, that when he spoke in Chicago he made his charge to rest upon the fact that the bill had the {{provision}} in it for submitting the constitution to a vote of the people when it went into his Judge Douglas's hands, that it was missing when he reported it to the Senate, and that in a public speech he had subsequently said the alterations in the bill were made while it was in committee, and that they were made in consultation between him (Judge Douglas) and Toomb's. And Judge Douglas goes on to comment upon the fact of Trumbull's adducing in his Alton speech the proposition that the bill not only came back with that proposition stricken out, but with another clause and another provision in it, saying that [...] "until the complete execution of this Act there shall be no election in said Territory,"--which, Trumbull argued, was not only taking the provision for submitting to a vote of the people out of the bill, but was adding an affirmative one, in that it prevented the people from exercising the right under a bill that was merely silent on the question. Now, in regard to what he says, that Trumbull shifts the issue, that <b>he</b> <b>shifts</b> his ground,--and I believe he uses the term that, [...] "it being proven false, he has changed ground," [...] I call upon all of you, when you come to examine that portion of Trumbull's speech (for it will make a part of mine), to examine whether Trumbull has shifted his ground or not. I say he did not shift his ground, but that he brought forward his original charge and the evidence to sustain it yet more fully, but precisely as he originally made it. Then, in addition thereto, he brought in a new piece of evidence. He shifted no ground. He brought no new piece of evidence inconsistent with his former testimony; but he brought a new piece, tending, as he thought, and as I think, to prove his proposition. To illustrate: A man brings an accusation against another, and on trial the man making the charge introduces A and B to prove the accusation. At a second trial he introduces the same witnesses, who tell the same story as before, and a third witness, who tells the same thing, and in addition gives further testimony corroborative of the charge. So with Trumbull. There was no shifting of ground, nor inconsistency of testimony between the new piece of evidence and what he originally introduced.|$|E
