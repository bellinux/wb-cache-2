40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{comprehensive overview}} of {{duties of members}} of a Limited Liability Company, {{and that in the}} situation, when new law about corporations and cooperatives, namely Act No. 90 / 2012 Sb., of corporations and cooperatives (Business Corporations Act), came into force. This law will replace the current Commercial Code, Act No. 513 / 1991 Sb., and that to the date of 1 st January 2014, when the Business Corporations Act will be effective. For that reason this work does not analyze only the currently effective regulation of duties of members of Limited Liability Company, but it is also focused on regulation effective from 1 st January 2014. In the first and second chapter is a reader introduced in the issues of Limited Liability Company, that it is followed up with the characteristic of business share and the definition of rights and duties in compliance with the juristic theory. The third chapter of the thesis is focused on possibilities of a <b>systematic</b> <b>arrangement</b> of duties of members of Limited Liability Company. Firstly there are described and critically evaluated possibilities of <b>systematic</b> <b>arrangements,</b> which are contained in specialized literature. Subsequently follows the <b>systematic</b> <b>arrangement</b> made by the author of the thesis, which is based on classification of duties according to [...] ...|$|R

40|$|SummaryA gain field, the {{scaling of}} a tuned {{neuronal}} response by a postural signal, may help support neuronal computation. Here, we characterize eye and hand position gain {{fields in the}} parietal reach region (PRR). Eye and hand gain fields in individual PRR neurons are similar in magnitude but opposite in sign to one another. This <b>systematic</b> <b>arrangement</b> produces a compound gain field that {{is proportional to the}} distance between gaze location and initial hand position. As a result, the visual response to a target for an upcoming reach is scaled by the initial gaze-to-hand distance. Such a scaling is similar to what would be predicted in a neural network that mediates between eye- and hand-centered representations of target location. This <b>systematic</b> <b>arrangement</b> supports a role of PRR in visually guided reaching and provides strong evidence that gain fields are used for neural computations...|$|R

40|$|Large {{numbers of}} diatom taxa are {{currently}} being described each year and molecular data sets are providing phylogenetic evidence that challenges the traditional <b>systematic</b> <b>arrangement</b> of diatoms, but is such information being integrated into the classification? The traditional diatom classification originated {{as an aid to}} identification rather than as an arrangement expressing perceived relationships, and characters for identification continue to bias taxonomic descriptions. Reference to types for nomenclatural purposes has resulted in overly narrow taxon descriptions; i. e. types have been considered representative specimens (typical) of taxa, whereas they may not lie at the centre of the range of variation of a taxon. This paper discusses how taxonomic concepts are subject to change in the light of new data and that such changes should be reflected in the <b>systematic</b> <b>arrangement.</b> It presents some thoughts on character choice and the need to make appropriate comparisons before new taxa are erected. The importance of the suprageneric classification is also discussed...|$|R

50|$|The {{diversity}} of treehoppers {{has been little}} researched, and their <b>systematic</b> <b>arrangement</b> is tentative. It seems three main lineages can be distinguished; the Endoiastinae are the most ancient treehoppers, still somewhat resembling cicadas. Centrotinae form the second group; they are somewhat more advanced but the pronotum still does not cover the scutellum in almost all of these. The Darninae, Heteronotinae, Membracinae and Smiliinae contain the most apomorphic treehoppers.|$|R
