40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the experience <b>travelling</b> and <b>incentive</b> <b>travelling</b> {{in the area}} of Etela-Savo. The <b>incentive</b> <b>travels</b> have become more popular in the recent years. The enterprises and companies have started to reward their staff for efficiency by giving them experience travels instead of money rewards. The staff needs refreshing because of the development of work technology and because of physical and mental demands of the work. Short experience travels with activities give motivation and refresh the staff. There were two target groups in this thesis: entrepreneurs which produce the experiences and the staffs which have proved them. With the help of these target groups experience products, activities and travelling possibilities were studied and also how the experiences had been felt and where they had been acquired from. There are theoretical and empirical parts in this thesis. The research methodology was mainly idiographical and also qualitative and quantitative research methods were used. The empirical information was collected {{with the help of a}} questionnaire and a theme interview. The result of the study was that the area's travelling attractions, which are the nature, hundreds of lakes, large forests and the beautiful landscape give good possibilities to experience <b>travelling</b> and <b>incentive</b> <b>travelling.</b> The experience must contain a physical, social and mental element. A good experience activity must also contain some actions in the nature, light physical exercise and a possibility to the customer to take part in action. The experience feeling was felt as an unique happening and enjoyment, which will help the customers managing in their work, removing stress and developing team working skills. The experience was caused by the contrast between work/everyday life and the happening, and by succeeding in the activity in addition they felt a very strong community spirit in the experience feeling. Women received the experience feeling much more strongly than men. There were also differences in feelings between ages...|$|R

These issues are addressed using a sample model where politicians use posts of varying importance to motivate bureaucrats, who respond by investing in skill or political loyalty to get important posts.

In 2009, the School of Dentistry and Oral Health, Griffith University, commenced a clinical placement in a remote rural community in Australia. This paper presents a simple cost analysis of the project from mid- 2008 to mid- 2011. Methods All expenditures of the project are audited by the Financial and Planning Services unit of the university. The budget was divided into capital and operational costs, and the latter were further subdivided into salary and non-salary costs, and these were further analysed for {{the various types of}} expenditures incurred. The value of the treatments provided and income generated is also presented.
