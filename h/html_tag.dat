40|$|Abstract- Whenever digital {{libraries}} or knowledge management systems {{are to be}} automatically filled with web pages from the internet, document classification of the web pages {{is one of the}} major challenges. We present an approach which uses <b>HTML</b> <b>tags</b> in order to improve the quality of the hypertext document classification. Our approach uses weighting of <b>HTML</b> <b>tags</b> for separating relevant information in hypertext documents from the noise. We have evaluated our approach on the basis of a document classification algorithm. The results show that our weighting approach yields a classification which is approximately 35 % better than a classification without the use of the <b>HTML</b> <b>tagging</b> information...|$|R

40|$|The {{complexity}} and {{the heterogeneity of}} a web document {{make it very difficult}} to be analyzed in order to find its main idea. Our approach to this problem is by looking at the <b>HTML</b> <b>tags</b> as cue phrases to locate the salient words of the web document. The common <b>HTML</b> <b>tags</b> that are used as cue phrases are the title or headings tag, the highlighted words tag and also the hyperlinks tag. In this paper, we are interested in the differences of the words carried by these <b>HTML</b> <b>tags</b> in describing the web document. In our experiment, we ran separate tests for each of these HTML using our prototype automatic topic identification system. The results that we obtained from this experiment showed that the <b>HTML</b> <b>tags</b> do carry words that have different degree of confidence. Therefore, one may use this differences in extracting information or finding the main idea of the web document in a more accurate way...|$|R

50|$|As {{a program}} manager on the Internet Explorer {{team in the}} mid-1990s, Scott not only defined DHTML but also created the CSS 2-D {{positioning}} specification, many of the form enhancements (e.g., LABEL, FieldSet) helping improve web-based form accessibility and usability, XML Data Islands, and much more. He wrote the original definitive guide to Dynamic HTML, Inside Dynamic HTML, published by Microsoft Press.

5000|$|In its infancy, {{very little}} {{was needed to}} fully {{optimize}} on page content {{in the eyes of}} Google. [...] With an inverse relationship between query position (in the <b>HTML</b> <b>tag</b> hierarchy) and weight, it simply boiled down to putting one’s important keywords higher on the <b>HTML</b> <b>tag</b> hierarchy. [...] With this relatively simple algorithm in place, webmasters quickly discovered tricks to vastly boost their SERP (Search Engine Ranking Position). One of the first instances of deceitful SEO {{came in the form of}} link keyword stuffing under on page content. As a response, Google removed these sites from its index, a practice it occasionally reverts to as a way of punishing disingenuous webmasters looking to cheat the system. The seemingly arbitrary changes to Googles PageRank algorithm however, led to both community outrage (“many declaring the “death of PageRank”) and a noticeable decline in precision of search results. [...] Google was also constructing its index via a large monthly crawl. Not only did this lock search results to this one month window, it also meant that results would show stale content. An update dubbed “Everflux” introduced fresh crawling (daily crawls) to supplement the larger, primary crawl. Daily crawling added another layer of relevancy (based upon date and time), to content ranking. [...] The inconsistencies of index versions across data centers during the early implementation of Everflux panicked users, who saw their SERPs fluctuate wildly from day to day.|$|E

5000|$|Violations of DRY are {{typically}} {{referred to as}} WET solutions, which is commonly taken to stand for either [...] "write everything twice", [...] "we enjoy typing" [...] or [...] "waste everyone's time". WET solutions are common in multi-tiered architectures where a developer may be tasked with, for example, adding a comment field on a form in a web application. The text string [...] "comment" [...] might be repeated in the label, the <b>HTML</b> <b>tag,</b> in a read function name, a private variable, database DDL, queries, and so on. A DRY approach eliminates that redundancy by leveraging frameworks that reduce or eliminate all those edit tasks excepting the most important one, leaving the extensibility of adding new knowledge variables in one place.|$|E
5000|$|The {{concept is}} similar in all languages: [...] is usually an {{immutable}} reference or pointer which refers to the current object; the current object often being the code that acts as 'parent' to the property, method, sub-routine or function that contains the [...] keyword. After an object is properly constructed, or instantiated, [...] is always a valid reference. Some languages require it explicitly; others use lexical scoping to use it implicitly to make symbols within their class visible. Or alternatively, the current object referred to by [...] may be an independent code object that has called the function or method containing the keyword [...] Such a thing happens, for example, when a Javascript event handler attached to an <b>HTML</b> <b>tag</b> in a web page calls a function containing the keyword [...] stored in the global space outside the document object; in that context, [...] will refer to the page element within the document object, not the enclosing window object.|$|E
5000|$|In the HTML syntax, most {{elements}} are written {{with a start}} tag and an end tag, with the content in between. An <b>HTML</b> <b>tag</b> is composed {{of the name of}} the element, surrounded by angle brackets. An end tag also has a slash after the opening angle bracket, to distinguish it from the start tag. For example, a paragraph, which is represented by the [...] element, would be written asHowever, not all of these elements require the end tag, or even the start tag, to be present. [...] Some elements, the so-called void elements or [...] empty elements, do not have an end tag. A typical example is the [...] element, which represents a significant line break, such as in a poem or an address. A void element's behaviour is predefined, and it cannot contain any content or other elements. For example, an address would be written asWhen using an XHTML DTD, it is required to open and close the element with a single tag. To specify that it is a void element, a [...] "/" [...] is included {{at the end of the}} tag (not to be confused with the [...] "/" [...] at the beginning of a closing tag).|$|E
