5|$|Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation <b>have</b> <b>criticized</b> <b>the</b> Debian {{project for}} hosting the non-free {{repository}} {{and because the}} contrib and non-free areas are easily accessible, an opinion echoed by some in Debian including the former project leader Wichert Akkerman. The internal dissent in the Debian project regarding the non-free section has persisted, but the last time {{it came to a}} vote in 2004, the majority decided to keep it.|$|E
5|$|William Burdick, Mark Hauswald, and Kenneth Iserson <b>have</b> <b>criticized</b> <b>the</b> above {{definition}} as oxymoronic, {{given the}} international nature {{of medicine and}} the number of physicians working internationally. From that point of view, international emergency medicine is not solely about development of emergency medical systems but is instead better described as the training required for and the reality of practicing the specialty outside of one's native country.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{said to be the}} largest non-wax Christmas candle in the country. Although {{conceived}} with the hopes of restoring Easton's pre-20th century reputation for elaborate Christmas decorations, city officials also believed a candle would serve as a symbol of peace for all religions and denominations. Due to its symbolism for peace and its placement over a Civil War monument, the candle has been the site of several anti-war protests over the decades. Some <b>have</b> <b>criticized</b> <b>the</b> Peace Candle, calling it a symbol of the over-commercialization of Christmas, and condemning the fact that it covers a war monument.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{scholars}} and readers <b>have</b> <b>criticized</b> <b>the</b> book for what {{are seen as}} condescending racist descriptions of the book's black characters, {{especially with regard to}} the characters' appearances, speech, and behavior, as well as the passive nature of Uncle Tom in accepting his fate. The novel's creation and use of common stereotypes about African Americans is significant because Uncle Tom's Cabin was the best-selling novel in the world during the 19th century. As a result, the book (along with illustrations from the book and associated stage productions) {{played a major role in}} permanently ingraining these stereotypes into the American psyche.|$|E
5|$|Murder on the Orient Express is {{the first}} game in the Agatha Christie series to feature Hercule Poirot, Christie's most popular and famous detective. David Suchet, whose {{portrayal}} of Poirot achieved fame through the popular television series Agatha Christie's Poirot, was hired to provide Poirot's voice. His performance was generally met with praise. Some <b>have</b> <b>criticized</b> <b>the</b> game for not allowing the player to actually control Poirot; the developers explained this choice by saying that adventure gamers who make mistakes throughout the game {{do not reflect the}} genius of Poirot, but are better represented by amateur sleuth Antoinette Marceau.|$|E

5|$|Reviewers {{have liked}} finding contradictions; a common complaint, however, is the games' linearity, {{as well as}} how the player {{sometimes}} has to resort to a trial-and-error method due to the games only accepting specific pieces of evidence, and how testimony statements sometimes need to be pressed in a specific order. Some reviewers <b>have</b> <b>criticized</b> <b>the</b> lack of changes to the gameplay and presentation throughout the series, while some have said that fans of the series would not have a problem with this.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} {{has been}} called a masterpiece depiction of a battle scene, and much more than a simple depiction of a bloody battle. It is a complex picture, requiring more than a cursory look; a French critic, viewing it in Paris in 1879, declared that it was a museum in its own right, requiring eight days of study before one could properly appreciate it. At the same time, critics have pointed to the unrealistic depiction of the battle, and some anachronistic accessories present in the painting. Others <b>have</b> <b>criticized</b> <b>the</b> painting for being too crowded and chaotic.|$|E
5|$|The {{terra cotta}} Spartan {{was removed from}} its base on May 12, 2005. During MSU's 2005 summer semester, the {{intersection}} at which the statue stood was completely redesigned to allow for safer traffic interaction with pedestrians. On Thursday, August 25, 2005, an unveiling of the new bronze Spartan took place. In addition, a Sesquicentennial parade on Saturday, October 8, 2005, concluded with a dedication ceremony at the statue. Meanwhile, the original terra cotta Spartan was {{moved to a new}} Spartan Stadium annex where it could be displayed safely indoors. Though most members of the MSU community agree that the original statue needs to be sheltered, some alumni and faculty <b>have</b> <b>criticized</b> <b>the</b> inaccessibility of the original statue.|$|E

5|$|Wines {{from the}} Languedoc can carry an {{enormous}} number of names, ranging from broad regional designations like Vin de Pays d'Oc to very specific geographical classifications with restrictions on grape variety, like Corbières and Minervois. Since the 1990s, the INAO has been creating smaller AOC classifications which take into account the intricate microclimates and soil variations in the Languedoc-Roussillon. Younger appellations like the Cabardes and subregions like Minervois la Livinière, Corbières-Boutenac and St-Chinian-Berlou are much smaller in scope. While these new appellations have been praised for consistently improving their product, others <b>have</b> <b>criticized</b> <b>the</b> additions for further complicating an already esoteric system of classification.|$|E
5|$|By June 2007, {{the project}} was delayed by half a year. One of the major delays in the project has been the {{development}} of the software for the health sector's communication centers—which consist of emergency wards, casualty wards, emergency dispatch centers and aircraft coordination centers. The system is being developed by Frequentis in Austria, who have stated that they did not receive sufficient specifications. In December 2009, the state granted NOK110 million extra for development of the system. Health workers will therefore be taking the network into use in May 2010, after the police and fire departments in Follo and Østfold. Representatives for the Police Directorate <b>have</b> <b>criticized</b> <b>the</b> implementation model and stated that in most other countries, the system was implemented first just for the police and afterwards taken into use by the fire and paramedic agencies. For instance, Østfold Police District had installed a new center in February 2008, but had to wait 21 months to take it into use while waiting for Public Safety Radio.|$|E
5|$|Many Public Storage {{customers}} have filed complaints with the Better Business Bureau regarding insurance policies sold by Public Storage representatives, after experiencing burglaries of their storage units then having their insurance claims denied. Investigative journalists from TV news stations in California, Kansas, and Washington have reported on difficulties consumers had when filing insurance claims for burglaries with Willis and The New Hampshire Insurance Company, which are affiliated with Public Storage. For example, claims {{have been denied}} because the storage unit had an intact lock; affiliated insurance companies cited insufficient evidence of forced entry, though burglars often replace the unit's lock {{in an attempt to}} conceal the burglary. Insurance commissioners in two states <b>have</b> <b>criticized</b> <b>the</b> practices of insurance companies affiliated with Public Storage. An ongoing class action lawsuit alleges Public Storage misleads consumers into thinking that insurance premiums are charged at cost, whereas a substantial amount of those premiums are retained as profits by Public Storage. Sales of these insurance policies do have a high profit, but generate less than five percent of the company's total revenue.|$|E

5|$|Since its inception, {{the scheme}} {{has been widely}} criticised. It has been {{considered}} undemocratic as it allows candidates {{who do not have}} the mandate of the people to air their views in Parliament. Furthermore, members of the opposition <b>have</b> <b>criticized</b> <b>the</b> scheme for creating an unequal playing field in a general election by enabling the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) to argue that the electorate need not vote for opposition candidates as there will already be some opposition representation in Parliament. Despite this critique, several opposition politicians have accepted NCMP seats, including Lee Siew-Choh, J. B. Jeyaretnam, Steve Chia and Sylvia Lim. NCMPs have raised notable points in Parliament with regards to various public policy issues such as criminal procedure, education, health and social welfare.|$|E
5|$|Some scientists, {{including}} Kerry Emanuel and Lakshmi Kantha, <b>have</b> <b>criticized</b> <b>the</b> {{scale as}} being simplistic, {{indicating that the}} scale takes into account neither the physical size of a storm nor the amount of precipitation it produces. Additionally, they and others {{point out that the}} Saffir–Simpson scale, unlike the Richter scale used to measure earthquakes, is not continuous, and is quantized into a small number of categories. Proposed replacement classifications include the Hurricane Intensity Index, which is based on the dynamic pressure caused by a storm's winds, and the Hurricane Hazard Index, which is based on surface wind speeds, the radius of maximum winds of the storm, and its translational velocity. Both of these scales are continuous, akin to the Richter scale; however, neither of these scales have been used by officials.|$|E
