5|$|It is {{revealed}} in the third episode that Suzanne Warren (played by Uzo Aduba) is also involved in the fight {{at the end of}} season one. She punches Chapman in the face twice and knocks her unconscious (Doggett is already unconscious at this stage). This <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> Doggett and Chapman were evenly matched and therefore equally responsible. Following Doggett's return to full health, she finds that her previous best friends, Leanne Taylor (played by Emma Myles) and Angie Rice (played by Julie Lake), no longer want to be associated with her. This leaves Doggett seeking prison counsellor Sam Healy (played by Michael J. Harney) for comfort.|$|E
5|$|Horowitz {{points out}} that the film's {{dichotomy}} of absolute good versus absolute evil glosses over the fact that most Holocaust perpetrators were ordinary people; the movie does not explore how the average German rationalized their knowledge of or participation in the Holocaust. Author Jason Epstein commented that the movie <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> if people were smart enough or lucky enough, they could survive the Holocaust; this was not actually the case. Spielberg responded to criticism that Schindler's breakdown as he says farewell is too maudlin and even out of character by pointing out that the scene is needed to drive home the sense of loss and to allow the viewer an opportunity to mourn alongside the characters on the screen.|$|E

25|$|The 1999 film, Onegin, is an English {{adaptation}} of Pushkin's work, directed by Martha Fiennes, and starring Ralph Fiennes as Onegin, Liv Tyler as Tatiana and Toby Stephens as Lensky. The film compresses {{the events of}} the novel somewhat: for example, the Naming Day celebrations take place on the same day as Onegin's speech to Tatiana. The 1999 film, much like the 1988 one, also <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> during the duel sequence Onegin deliberately shoots to kill. This screen version was also criticized for a number of mistakes and inconsistencies.|$|E
25|$|Corbusier's piloti {{perform a}} number of {{functions}} around the house, both inside and out. On the two longer elevations they are flush {{with the face of}} the façade and imply heaviness and support, but on the shorter sides they are set back giving a floating effect that emphasises the horizontal feeling of the house. The wide strip window to the first floor terrace has two baby piloti to support and stiffen the wall above.

25|$|Military {{training}} and strategy are two important matters {{on which the}} sources are more than usually silent. There are no references in literature or laws to men training, {{and so it is}} necessary to fall back on inference. For the noble warrior, his childhood was of first importance in learning both individual military skills and the teamwork essential for success in battle. Perhaps the games the youthful Cuthbert played ('wrestling, jumping, running, and every other exercise') had some military significance. Turning to strategy, of the period before Alfred the evidence <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> <b>Impression</b> <b>that</b> Anglo-Saxon armies fought battles frequently. If this is not solely due to the deficiencies of the sources, it would make England a special case. Battle was risky and best avoided unless all the factors were on your side. But if you were in a position so advantageous that you were willing to take the chance, it is likely that your enemy would be in such a weak position that he would avoid battle and pay tribute. Unless, of course, he was Bede's Oswald and trusted in God. Anyway, battle put the princes' lives at risk, as is demonstrated by the Northumbrian and Mercian overlordships brought to an end by a defeat in the field. Gillingham has shown how few pitched battles successful Charlemagne and Richard I chose to fight.|$|E

25|$|By March 2011, {{the market}} share of OS X in North America had {{increased}} to slightly over 14%. Whether {{the size of the}} Mac's market share and installed base is relevant, and to whom, is a hotly debated issue. Industry pundits have often called attention to the Mac's relatively small market share to predict Apple's impending doom, particularly in the early and mid-1990s when the company's future seemed bleakest. Others argue that market share is the wrong way to judge the Mac's success. Apple has positioned the Mac as a higher-end personal computer, and so it may be misleading to compare it to a budget PC. Because the overall market for personal computers has grown rapidly, the Mac's increasing sales numbers are effectively swamped by the industry's expanding sales volume as a whole. Apple's small market share, then, <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> fewer people are using Macs than did ten years ago, when exactly the opposite is true. Soaring sales of the iPhone and iPad mean that the portion of Apple's profits represented by the Macintosh has declined in 2010, dropping to 24% from 46% two years earlier. Others try to de-emphasize market share, citing that it is rarely brought up in other industries. Regardless of the Mac's market share, Apple has remained profitable since Steve Jobs' return and the company's subsequent reorganization. Notably, a report published {{in the first quarter of}} 2008 found that Apple had a 14% market share in the personal computer market in the US, with 66% of all computers over $1,000. Market research indicates that Apple draws its customer base from a higher-income demographic than the mainstream personal computer market.|$|E
500|$|In the film, {{the last}} few lines of the song [...] "Ol' Man River" [...] (from Show Boat) are sung by what sounds like a tenor, while the song was {{intended}} for bass Paul Robeson and sung in the original production by bass-baritone Jules Bledsoe. Further, the screenplay also <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> the successful original production of Show Boat, which Ziegfeld produced, closed because of the Great Depression. In fact Show Boat ended its original 1927 run {{in the spring of}} 1929 and the stock market crash did not occur until October of that year. It was the 1932 revival of the show (also produced by Ziegfeld shortly before his death), not the original production, that was affected by the Depression.|$|E
500|$|The song {{begins with}} a [...] "strange, electronic, {{slightly}} broken noise" [...] that spans between {{the start of the}} song up until 54 seconds. The ambient-influenced beginning <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> [...] "Nothing Really Matters" [...] would be a ballad, but in the minute mark, it changes to a mid-tempo dance-pop song. The ambient music becomes restrained, although a cursory bleeping sound can be heard from the right to the left. The background has a number of faint strings in it, which signifies the depth of the stereo field. The chorus starts with a fast-pacing dance sound, over which Madonna sings, [...] "Nothing really matters / love is all we need / everything I give you / all comes back to me." [...] Throughout the entire song, it includes two verses, three choruses, one bridge section, and an outro. The bridge is backed by piano sounds with a descending sequence by a couple of bars. Madonna sings the same lyrics in the outro, but is slowed down and echoed longer until the music fades out.|$|E

500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{wrote in}} his review of the episode, [...] "Some {{sluggish}} stories took better turns this week – albeit sometimes by just ending things for now – while a book character many thought would never appear on the series made a notable splash, answering a big mystery that the novels hadn’t even revealed yet in the process. There were some great moments in [...] "Blood of My Blood", but mostly the big returns {{made it possible to}} salivate for the payoffs (and possible characters) to come." [...] He also continued by noting, [...] "this installment probably speaks, more than any other episode so far this season, to the accelerated rate of payoffs we're now getting that the show isn't directly following the books." [...] Fowler gave the episode an 8.6 out of 10. Laura Prudom of Variety also praised the pacing of the episode as well as the season's payoffs, writing [...] "There's a clarity of purpose in Season 6 that certainly <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> we're barreling towards a conclusion instead of just meandering through Dorne or killing time in Qarth." ...|$|E
500|$|Several anime and manga {{publications}} {{have provided}} both praise and criticism of Sanosuke's character. Anime News Network said that Sanosuke's first {{fight in the}} series against Kenshin was stereotypical for an action series due to the differences between Sanosuke's and Kenshin's personalities, and to the music used in the anime that <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> Kenshin would win. In the Critical Survey of Graphic Novels: Manga, multiple writers acknowledged how both Sanosuke and Yahiko spend {{their time in the}} series searching for ways to become stronger. However, they do it for a heroic reason which is assisting Kenshin. SciFi.com commended him for being a good source of comic relief and described his appearance as a video-game icon. However, they commented he was a [...] "tragic figure [...] whose goofy peccadilloes have solid reasons behind them" [...] due to being unable to avoid the destruction of the Sekihotai army and feeling guilty due to it. Mania Entertainment praised Sanosuke's character development and transformation from an enemy of Kenshin into one of his most stalwart friends. In the [...] original video animation, Mike Crandol of Anime News Network referred to Sanosuke's revised design as [...] "pretty awkward" [...] since Crandol felt Sanosuke's original character design was [...] "perhaps being too cartoonish to translate well into this new style," [...] with the [...] "new style" [...] being the [...] "decidedly more realistic look" [...] exhibited in all of the Samurai X original video animations.|$|E

2500|$|Both {{the diaries}} and the memoirs are noted for their caustic and succinct portraits of Iorga's main rivals: Maiorescu as {{inflexible}} and unemotional, Dimitrie Sturdza as avaricious, Nae Ionescu as [...] "an awful temper", Hungarian politician István Tisza as a [...] "Turanian" [...] tyrant; Iorga contributed particularly emotional, and critically acclaimed, tributes {{for his political}} friends, from Vasile Bogrea to Yugoslavia's Nikola Pašić. Supt trei regi abunds in positive and negative portrayals, but, Călinescu notes, it fails to show Iorga as politically astute: [...] "he <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> he knows no more [...] than {{the man of the}} street." ...|$|E
2500|$|Saleh's {{depiction}} is not {{the only}} painted version of Diponegoro's capture. An earlier version, The Submission of Prince Dipo Negoro to General De Kock, was completed [...] 1835 by Nicolaas Pieneman on commission by De Kock or his family. Rather than an angry and defiant man, Pieneman presented a submissive and beaten Diponegoro, standing lower than his captor and thus symbolically having less power. Overall, Pieneman's painting <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that,</b> although De Kock is acting sternly in exiling Diponegoro, it {{is in the best interest}} of the Javanese. The author Susie Protschky describes both Pieneman and Saleh's works as [...] "two of the best known history paintings from the Indies".|$|E
