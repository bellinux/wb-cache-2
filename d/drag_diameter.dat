40|$|The {{wake effect}} of yawing an {{upstream}} turbines {{is of interest}} {{in order to increase}} power production. In this study, the case of yawing is considered as asymmetric do to the tower and rotor rotation, and measurements have been performed in a wind tunnel. The rotational effects when yawing are obtained by investigating the difference between a disc and a rotor with the same <b>drag</b> and <b>diameter.</b> This is performed during a tower-symmetrical setup, and shows that the wake deflects approximately 1 radius for the disc and significantly less for the rotor at optimal tip speed ratio. The disc wake is similar to a jet shape in a crossflow and counter-rotating vortices are present, which is not the case for the rotor. Moreover, the differences between yawing in the different direction are investigated and show that for positive yaw-angles, the wake spreads more out and deflects more to the side and to the floor. Furthermore, for negative yaw-angles, the wake is located closer to downstream the rotor centre. These differences are slightly less present during shear flow conditions, in addition to a more sideways deflected wake...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPast {{work has}} shown large {{variation}} in the drag of baseballs. Little is known concerning the causes of variation in ball <b>drag.</b> Ball <b>diameter,</b> weight, seam height, surface roughness, and shape influence lift and drag, and therefore carry distance. The aim of this work was to quantify the effect of seam height and roundness on ball lift and drag, which, to our understanding, has never been done outside of a wind tunnel. A bespoke, non-contact, ball surface profiler, {{was used to measure}} ball radius, including seam height. The profiles were analyzed to describe ball roundness and seam height separately. Balls with three different seam heights were projected in an enclosed stadium 102 - 122 m (describing a typical fly ball). Redundant radar devices were used to measure launch angle, speed, and flight paths. High speed video was used to confirm launch angle and ball spin rate. Hit distance was verified with a physical tape measure. The ball's roundness influenced the effective height of a seam. Measurements of the non-seam area of a ball were necessary to characterize the seams of a ball. A strong correlation was observed between seam height and a ball's drag coefficient. Lift, however, was not sensitive to seam height or ball shape...|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the use of}} cup sabots {{of various}} {{complexity}} are popular with rifle ammunition hand-loaders, {{in order to achieve}} significantly higher muzzle velocity with a lower <b>drag,</b> smaller <b>diameter</b> and lighter bullet, successful saboted projectile design has to include the resulting bullet stability characteristics. For example, simply inserting a commercially available 5.56mm (.224) bullet into a sabot that will fire it from a commercially available 7.62mm (.300) barrel may result in that 5.56mm bullet failing to achieve sufficient gyroscopic stability to fly accurately without tumbling. To achieve gyroscopic stability of longer bullets in smaller diameter requires faster rifling. [...] Therefore, if a bullet requires at least 1 turn in 7 inch twist, (1:7 rifling), in 5.56mm, it will also require at least 1:7 rifling when saboted in 7.62mm. However, larger caliber commercial rifles generally don't need such fast twist rates; 1:10 being a readily available standard in 7.62mm. As a result, the twist rate of the larger barrel will dictate which smaller bullets can be fired with sufficient stability out of a sabot. In this example, using 1:10 rifling in 7.62mm restricts saboting to 5.56mm bullets that require 1:10 twist or slower, and this requirement will tend to restrict saboting to the shorter (and lighter) 5.56mm bullets.|$|R

Recovery characteristics were satisfactory for erect and inverted spins when the model was in the clean condition. When the slow-down brakes were open, recoveries were slow. The pedal force necessary to reverse the airplane rudder during a spin will be within the physical capabilities of the pilot. A 10 -foot-diameter parachute attached to {{the tail of the}} airplane (laid-out-flat <b>diameter,</b> <b>drag</b> coefficient 0. 7) or a 4. 5 -foot-diameter parachute attached to the outboard wing tip will be satisfactory for emergency spin recovery from demonstration spins.

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{modification}} of drag by neutrally buoyant spherical particles in highly turbulent Taylor-Couette flow. These particles {{can be used to}} disentangle the effects of size, deformability, and volume fraction on the drag, when contrasted with the drag for bubbly flows. We find that rigid spheres hardly change the drag of the system beyond the trivial viscosity effects caused by replacing the working fluid with particles. The size of the particle has a marginal effect on the <b>drag,</b> with smaller <b>diameter</b> particles showing only slightly lower drag. Increasing the particle volume fraction shows a net drag increase as the effective viscosity of the fluid is also increased. The increase in drag for increasing particle volume fraction is corroborated by performing laser Doppler anemometry where we find that the turbulent velocity fluctuations also increase with increasing volume fraction. In contrast with rigid spheres, for bubbles the effective drag reduction also increases with increasing Reynolds number. Bubbles are also much more effective in reducing the overall drag.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} heat and mass transport in singlewalled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) using molecular dynamics methods. Particular attention was paid on the non-equilibrium dynamics at {{the interface between}} SWNT and other materials, which strongly manifests in nanoscale. In the first part, we {{have investigated}} the heat transport through the interface between SWNTs and surrounding argon matrices in liquid and solid phases. By analyzing the energy relaxation from SWNT to the matrices using non-stationary molecular dynamics simulations, elastic and inelastic thermal energy transports across the interface were separately quantified. The result reveals that the elastic interaction transports energy much faster than the inelastic one, but carries much smaller energy due to slow intra-SWNT phonon relaxation. In the second part, we have investigated a possibility to utilize nonequilibrium thermal interface to transport water through an SWNT. By applying the longitudinal temperature gradient to the SWNT, it is demonstrated that the water cluster is efficiently driven at average acceleration proportional to the temperature gradient. However, the transport simulations with a junction of two different SWNTs suggest that an angstrom diameter difference {{may result in a}} significant <b>drag</b> for small <b>diameter</b> SWNTs...|$|R

There was good agreement but the level of erosion was underestimated by the predictions. The calculation method {{and the use of}} paint to obtain wear patterns were both promising methods.

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a comparison between}} an isolated and a non-isolated curved liquid jet emerging from a rotating nozzle through centrifuge spinning system. In the centrifugal spinning process, a polymer solution has been pushed by the centrifugal force through small nozzle of a rapidly rotating cylindrical drum. Thereby thin fibers are formed and collected on a collector {{in the form of a}} web. Centrifuge spinning suffered from a strong air resistance which leads to a more deflected jet as well as its rapidly solvent evaporation resulting in thicker nanofibers. In this work, centrifuge spinning has been equipped by a rotating collector, whereas the fabrication process was skillfully sealed from ambient airflow. A comparison was drawn between the trajectory of Newtonian liquid jets fabricated by centrifuge spinning and air-sealed centrifuge spinning. The captured images of the liquid jet trajectory using a high speed camera showed that non-isolated liquid jets were more curved than isolated liquid jets due to air resistance. A pre-presented non-linear analysis of the Navier-Stokes equations was carried out and the numerical solutions were compared with the experiments. There was fairly good agreement between the isolated jet trajectory and the model-predicted one, but there were differences between the non-isolated jet trajectory and the simulation results. The non-isolated jet curved more compared to the others due to air <b>drag.</b> Also, the <b>diameter</b> of polymeric nanofibers was predicted and compared with experiments.

40|$|Endovascular aortic stent-graft is a new, {{minimally}} invasive procedure for treating thoracic aortic diseases, and has quickly evolved {{to be one of}} the standard treatments subject to anatomic constraints. Stent-graft deployment in the thoracic aorta, especially close to the aortic arch, normally experiences a significant drag force which might lead to the risk of stent-graft failure. A comprehensive investigation on the biomechanical factors affecting the drag force on a stent-graft in the thoracic aorta is thus in order, and the goal here is to perform an in-depth study on the contributing biomechanical factors. Three factors affecting the deployed stent-graft are considered, namely, the internal diameter of the vessel, the starting position of the graft and the diameter of curvature of the aortic arch. Computational fluid dynamic techniques are applied to model the blood flow. The three-dimensional continuity equation and the time-dependent Navier-Stokes equations for an incompressible fluid were solved numerically. The drag force due to the change of momentum within the stent-graft and the shear stress were calculated and analyzed. The drag force on a stent-graft will depend critically on the internal diameter and the starting position of stent-graft deployment. Larger internal diameter leads to larger drag force and the stent-graft deployed at the more distal position may be associated with significantly diminished <b>drag</b> force. Smaller <b>diameter</b> of curvature of the aortic arch results in a decrease of the drag force. These findings may have important implications for the choice and design of stent-grafts in the future. © 2007 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{evaluation of the}} spin and recovery characteristics of the XF 3 D- 1 airplane has been made, based primarily {{on the results of}} the free-spinning tunnel tests of a model which closely simulated the XF 3 D- 1 in tail design, tail length, and mass loading. Estimates have been made of the rudder-pedal force that may be encountered in effecting recovery from a spin and of the spin recovery parachute requirements of the airplane for demonstration spins. The method of bail-out which should be used if it becomes necessary for the crew to abandon the airplane during a spin is indicated. It was indicated that the recovery characteristics of the XF 3 D- 1 airplane in the clean condition for erect and inverted spins would be satisfactory for all loadings specified by the contractor as possible on the airplane. However, if a spin is inadvertently entered while the landing flaps are down, recovery may be slow. The slow-down brakes and the landing flaps should be retracted immediately upon the inception of a spinning condition, after which recovery from the spin should be attempted. The pedal force necessary to reverse the rudder during a spin will be within the physical capabilities of the pilot. Opening a 10 -foot diameter parachute attached to the tail (laid-out-flat <b>diameter,</b> <b>drag</b> coefficient 0. 7) or a 4. 5 -foot diameter parachute attached to the outboard wing tip will insure satisfactory spin recovery from demonstration spins.

40|$|Wind tunnel {{experiments}} {{have been carried}} out in order to study the effect of full-span mini-spoilers on the afterbody vortex drag of a slanted base cylinder. Two different protrusion heights (h/D = 2. 5 % and 5 %) were examined at various chordwise locations along the upsweep. The tests were performed on a slanted base cylindrical model with an afterbody upsweep angle Φ = 28 ° at a test Reynolds number of 200, 000 based on model <b>diameter.</b> <b>Drag</b> measurements, surface pressure measurements and 2 D Particle Image Velocimetry measurements were the main experimental tools utilized within this investigation. Placing the spoilers closer to {{the leading edge of the}} upsweep caused an increased drag due to the separation induced by the spoiler itself, leading to a more diffused vortex, but with a larger circulation at the trailing-edge. Drag reductions were observed when placing the spoiler closer to the trailing-edge, with the optimum location being x′s /c = 87. 5 % resulting in drag reductions of 4. 5 % and 4. 8 % for h/D = 2. 5 % and 5 % heights respectively. This reduction is due to an increase in surface pressure upstream of the spoiler. For the drag reducing spoiler location, the vortex was found to be displaced away from the surface, with the streamlines of the model trailing-edge deflected downwards into the wake of the spoiler, altering the trailing-edge flow. Unsteady aspects are discussed and underlying flow mechanisms are presented using the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition. Further results are also presented for a vortex generator configuration that was examined which may present a useful starting point for future studies. A co-rotating half delta wing type vortex generator placed at an incidence of β = 20 ° at x/c = 20 % with a leading edge sweep of Λ = 70 ° was found to show the most promising results...|$|R
40|$|The flow {{structure}} around a circular cylinder with U-grooved surfaces {{has been investigated}} experimentally. The results were {{compared with that of}} a smooth cylinder having the same <b>diameter.</b> <b>Drag</b> force and turbulence statistics of wake behind each cylinder were measured for Reynolds numbers based on the cylinder diameter (D= 60 mm) in the range Re(D) = 8 × 10 ^ 3 – 1. 4 × 10 ^ 5. At Re(D) = 1. 4 × 10 ^ 5, the U-type grooves reduce the drag coefficient acting on the cylinder by 18. 6 %, compared with that of smooth cylinder. The flow characteristics of wake behind the U-grooved cylinder have been analyzed using two kinds of particle image velocimetry (PIV) velocity measurement techniques, cinematic PIV and high-resolution PIV. Consecutive instantaneous velocity fields were measured using the cinematic PIV technique at time interval of 5 ms, corresponding to about 1 % of the vortex shedding frequency of the wake. The instantaneous velocity fields measured with the high-resolution PIV technique were ensemble-averaged to get the spatial distributions of turbulent statistics including turbulent intensities and turbulent kinetic energy. For the case of smooth cylinder, large-scale vortices formed behind the cylinder maintain round shape and do not spread out noticeably in the near wake. However, for the case of U-grooved cylinder, the vortices are largely distorted and spread out significantly as they go downstream. The longitudinal grooves seem to shift the location of spanwise vortices toward the cylinder, reducing the vortex formation region, compared with the smooth cylinder. The sharp peaks of longitudinal U-shaped grooves also suppress the formation of large-scale secondary streamwise vortices. The secondary vortices are broken into smaller eddies, reducing turbulent kinetic energy in the near-wake region...|$|R
40|$|The US NRC is {{planning}} to use advanced best estimate thermal hydraulics computer codes to analyze the safety systems of next-generation nuclear power plants in order to streamline the licensing process and improve the viability of nuclear power for electric utilities. In advanced BWR designs the chimney section above the core is generally modeled as a large diameter pipe. Advanced codes utilize the two-fluid model, which treats both phases with separate equations for conservation of mass, momentum and energy. The two-fluid model {{has been shown to}} work extremely well; however it has one weak link in the constitutive models for the interfacial interactions. For this approach to work, the computer codes require accurate models {{for a wide variety of}} two-phase flow phenomena. One of the interfacial transfer terms is the interfacial drag force, which is essential for accurately calculating the void fraction in dispersed bubbly flow. Current advanced codes utilize a drift-flux based approach to this modeling. As each of these flow regimes differ significantly in their governing physical mechanisms, accurate flow regime data is also essential to any modeling effort. It has been found that insufficient data exists to accurately assess the existing models for interfacial <b>drag</b> in large <b>diameter</b> pipes at high void fractions. ^ In light of this, data has been collected in pipes of diameter 0. 152 m and 0. 203 m with liquid velocity conditions of 0. 05 m/s to 1. 0 m/s, gas velocities of 0. 01 m/s to 5. 0 m/s and void fractions from 0. 05 to 0. 8 in order to augment the existing void fraction database, develop accurate models for the flow regime transitions, and evaluate the current models for the prediction of interfacial drag in large pipes. A new approach to modeling the drag force in the two-fluid model, a scheme for drift-flux modeling in pipes and a new transition model for the cap bubbly to churn-turbulent flow regime transition have been proposed. The use of impedance meters in pipes with diameters up to 0. 203 m was validated, Pressure was found to have negligible effect on the accuracy of the recommended drift-flux models, Hydraulic diameter was found to have no effect on the two-phase flow for non-dimensional diameters greater than 55 and axial development of the flow regime was found to have little effect on the void fraction prediction. Finally, a new method of flow regime identification has been proposed and the recommended drift-flux models for pipes have been validated. ^ In addition, though the proposed flow regime transition criterion has not been validated, what results are available from the flow regime identification seems to support the proposed transition. Additional work is required to find an accurate method of determining the flow regime in large pipes through the use of impedance meters. Also, additional work should be done collect local data so that interfacial area relations can be developed in large pipes and the proposed model for interfacial drag can be validated. ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2012 A {{method was}} sought {{to predict the}} flight paths and {{collisions}} for closely spaced ink droplets of various sizes as a design aid for ink-jet printing development. Computational fluid dynamics models of two rigid aligned spheres, {{as a proxy for}} ink droplets, were initiated in atmospheric pressure air at constant velocities of 6 m/s to 14 m/s, and drag coefficients were calculated from the forces which developed on the spheres. Simulations were run for the Reynolds number range of 5 to 25 for equal sized 20 μm and 26 μm sphere pairs at center-to-center separation distances of 1. 5 to 19 sphere diameters. For separations of 5 diameters and less, where relative sphere size was found to influence the drag, simulations were also conducted using smaller trailing spheres of 0. 6 and 0. 8 times the diameter of the leading sphere. Empirical equations were found for the drag coefficients as a function of separation distance, which also incorporated a factor to account for unequal sized spheres. From these equations a calculator was developed to estimate the sphere trajectories, and the collision time and distance, for two spheres given the initial diameters, velocity and separation distance. The calculator predicts that in a 2 mm distance between an inkjet cartridge and the paper, equal sized spheres will collide when separated by no more than 3 diameters for the 14 m/s, 26 μm diameter case and up to 5 diameters for the 6 m/s, 20 μm diameter case. The collision distance, in meters, can be estimated for equal sized spheres from 1 x 10 ⁻⁵δ⁰ ̇²³d 1 for separations of 5 diameters and less, where δ is the separation in diameters and d 1 is the leading sphere diameter. Similarly, the collision time in seconds for equal sized spheres at δ = 5 or less, can be estimated from 1 x 10 ⁻⁵δ⁰ ̇¹⁸d₁/U, where U is the start velocity of the spheres. For unequal sized sphere pairs, the decreased drag on the smaller trailing sphere is counteracted by faster loss of momentum compared to the leading sphere. For cases where the ratio of drag coefficients for the trailing sphere divided by the leading sphere is greater than the ratio of their diameters, there is less drag improvement from the separation distance than there is relative deceleration increase from the differences in mass, and the spheres will not collide. At separations less than six <b>diameters,</b> <b>drag</b> reduction was found to be significant for both the leading and trailing spheres compared to a single sphere at the same Reynolds number. At the closest separation of 1. 5 diameters, over 10 % drag reduction was found for the leading sphere and up to 50 % drag reduction was found for the trailing sphere. The primary contributor to the drag reduction on the trailing sphere was found to be the reduced velocity field created in front of the trailing sphere. The leading sphere has drag reduction caused by modification to its wake region. The average drag reduction for both spheres was also found to be within ± 3 % of the creeping flow analytical two sphere solution...|$|R
