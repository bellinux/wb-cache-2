5|$|Millennium Group {{consultant}} Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) {{is convinced}} {{to return to}} work after the death of a close friend. However, it soon becomes apparent that his first case back on the job is much deeper than <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected.</b>|$|E
5|$|Oda {{revealed}} that he originally planned One Piece to last five years, {{and that he had}} already planned the ending. However, he found it would take longer than <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected.</b> Oda stated that the ending would be what he had decided in the beginning; he is committed to seeing it through.|$|E
5|$|Harrison {{attended}} {{the world premiere}} of Wonderwall, held at the Cannes Film Festival on 17 May 1968, accompanied by his wife Pattie Boyd, Starr and Birkin. Although <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> the film's producers to purchase the soundtrack rights and issue the album independently, they declined to do so, leading Massot to suggest that Harrison release it on the Beatles' new label, Apple Records. Wonderwall Music therefore became Apple's first album release, as well as the first solo album {{by a member of the}} Beatles.|$|E
50|$|Remitting {{the case}} back for trial the court made a {{suggestion}} {{to the district}} judge to consider it as a test: Whether Lennon had knowledge {{that what he was}} doing was unauthorised, what answer would <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> if <b>he</b> <b>had</b> asked D&G whether he might start the program.|$|R
60|$|Such was Alaric's {{theory of}} life. But not the less would <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> {{gratitude}} from those whom he might serve. Such also very probably was Sir Gregory's theory {{when he thought}} {{of those who had}} helped him, instead of those whom <b>he</b> himself <b>had</b> helped.|$|R
60|$|Peter Gubbins, with 'is arm {{tied up in}} a sling, was the fust one to turn up at the Cauliflower, and he {{was that}} down-'arted about it we couldn't do nothing with 'im. <b>He</b> <b>'ad</b> <b>expected</b> {{to be able to}} pull out ten golden sovereigns, and the disapp'intment was too much for 'im.|$|R
5|$|It was at {{this time}} that Giáp began his countermoves. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> an attack, but could not foresee when or where it would occur. Giáp {{realized}} that, if pressed, the French would abandon Lai Châu Province and fight a pitched battle at Điện Biên Phủ. On 24 November, Giáp ordered the 148th Infantry Regiment and the 316th Division to attack Lai Chau, while the 308th, 312th, and 351st divisions assault Điện Biên Phủ from Việt Bắc.|$|E
5|$|Super Monkey Ball was commercially {{successful}} upon {{release and}} remained one of Sega's best-selling {{titles in the}} United States through much of 2002. While it sold well in all major territories, Nagoshi was disappointed by the game's performance in Japan, where <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> it would be most successful; weak GameCube launch sales were cited as negatively impacting its performance in the country.|$|E
5|$|When the British {{governor}} of Uganda, Sir Harry Johnston, discovered some pygmy {{inhabitants of the}} Congo being abducted by a showman for exhibition, he rescued them and promised to return them to their homes. The grateful pygmies fed Johnston's curiosity about the animal mentioned in Stanley's book. Johnston was puzzled by the okapi tracks the natives showed him; while <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> {{to be on the}} trail of some sort of forest-dwelling horse, the tracks were of a cloven-hoofed beast.|$|E
60|$|Uncle John gave a {{start of}} dismay. Here was a {{development}} <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not <b>expected.</b>|$|R
60|$|It {{was the old}} {{protest and}} the old reply. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> hardly <b>expected</b> {{anything}} different.|$|R
6000|$|... "Stand up! Stand {{up and let}} us look!" [...] said Lady Franks. [...] "There now, isn't it handsome? And isn't it a {{great deal}} of honour for one man? Could <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> so much, in one life-time? I call it wonderful. Come and look at yourself, dear"--and she led him to a mirror.|$|R
5|$|A year {{prior to}} Kameo release, GamesRadar wrote {{that while they}} highly {{anticipated}} the title and {{expected it to be}} of high quality, they thought the game's continual delays would likely hurt the final product. Closer to release, Tom Bramwell (Eurogamer) added that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> the game to be the best among the Xbox 360 launch titles. Kameo core gameplay concept brought his anticipation to par with that customary for The Legend of Zelda titles, and he thought the game would reap the benefits of its long development through refined audiovisuals. Xbox executive Peter Moore announced Kameo as his favorite launch title in anticipation of the Xbox 360's launch.|$|E
5|$|Although {{supplies}} {{had been}} left in Aladdin's Cave—including fresh fruit—there were not the spare crampons <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected.</b> Without them he could not hope to descend the steep ice slope to the hut, and so he began to fashion his own, collecting nails from every available source and hammering them into wood from spare packing cases. Even when completed, a blizzard confined him to the cave, and only on 8 February was he able to begin the descent. Nearing the hut, he was spotted by three men working outside, who rushed {{up the hill to}} meet him.|$|E
5|$|E. Newton {{noted that}} <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> the male would be {{adorned with a}} red patch on the wing, but {{that the absence of}} this {{indicated}} it was immature. He still found it more beautiful than the female. These two specimens are the only preserved individuals of the species. The mandible and sternum were extracted from the female specimen, and subfossil remains have since been found in the Plaine Corail caverns on Rodrigues. The genus Palaeornis was later declared a junior synonym of Psittacula, and all species within the former were transferred to the latter. The genus name Psittacula is derived from the Latin words Psittacus, which means parrot, and -ula, which is a diminutive suffix.|$|E
60|$|Now Ishmael paled, for <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not <b>expected</b> such a welcome, {{and began}} to deny the thing.|$|R
60|$|The calm {{insolence}} of her manner {{towards him}} took him aback. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> scarcely <b>expected</b> such a reception.|$|R

5|$|F. During the series, it was {{revealed}} that the Victoria club had not filed a formal challenge. A letter arrived from the Stanley Cup trustees on March 17, stating that the trustees would not let the Stanley Cup travel west, as they did not consider Victoria a proper challenger because they had not formally notified the trustees. However, on March 18, Trustee William Foran stated that it was a misunderstanding. PCHA president Frank Patrick had not filed a challenge, because <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> Emmett Quinn, president of the NHA to make all of the arrangements in his role as hockey commissioner, whereas the trustees thought they were being deliberately ignored. In any case, all arrangements had been ironed out and the Victoria challenge was accepted.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Indiana farmer Vernon Hugh Bowman bought soybean crop {{seeds from}} a local grain {{elevator}} for his second crop of the season. He then saved seeds from his second crop to replant additional crops in later years. Bowman purchased these soybean seeds from the same elevator to which he and neighbors sold their soybean crops, {{many of which were}} transgenic, and the elevator sold these soybeans as commodities, not as seeds for planting. He tested the new seeds, and found that, as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected,</b> some were transgenic and thus were resistant to glyphosate. He replanted seeds from the original second harvest in subsequent years for his second seasonal planting, supplementing them with more soybeans he bought at the elevator. He informed Monsanto of his activities.|$|E
5|$|Peterle conceded immediately. In {{his first}} statements, Peterle said his defeat was a {{vote against the}} ruling Janša government, and that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> a better result. He added, however, {{that he would have}} regretted it if he had not decided to run for the office. By midnight, {{unofficial}} results from the Electoral Commission gave Türk a lead of 68% vs. 32%. Türk won in all eight electoral units, with Peterle narrowly winning in only four of 88 electoral districts. Together with {{the second round of the}} election, a referendum on a law providing for the nationalization of citizens' share in the major national insurance company was held as well. Nearly three quarters of the votes were cast against the law.|$|E

60|$|Whatever else Syme <b>had</b> <b>expected,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> never <b>expected</b> {{anything}} so brutal and actual as this. Even his great {{presence of mind}} could only manage a reply {{with an air of}} rather blundering jocularity.|$|R
5|$|In 1683, George and his brother, Frederick Augustus, {{served in}} the Great Turkish War at the Battle of Vienna, and Sophia Dorothea bore George a son, George Augustus. The {{following}} year, Frederick Augustus was informed of the adoption of primogeniture, meaning {{he would no longer}} receive part of his father's territory as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected.</b> It led to a breach between father and son, and between the brothers, that lasted until Frederick Augustus's death in battle in 1690. With the imminent formation of a single Hanoverian state, and the Hanoverians' continuing contributions to the Empire's wars, Ernest Augustus was made an Elector of the Holy Roman Empire in 1692. George's prospects were now better than ever as the sole heir to his father's electorate and his uncle's duchy.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, the Victoria Aristocrats {{from the}} Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) {{challenged}} the NHA and Cup champion Toronto Blueshirts. A controversy erupted when a letter {{arrived from the}} Stanley Cup trustees on March 17, that the trustees would not let the Stanley Cup travel west, as they did not consider Victoria a proper challenger because they had not formally notified the trustees. However, on March 18, Trustee William Foran stated {{that it was a}} misunderstanding. PCHA president Frank Patrick had not filed a challenge, because <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> Emmett Quinn of the NHA to make all of the arrangements in his role as hockey commissioner, whereas the trustees thought they were being deliberately ignored.

5|$|In {{response}} to the decline in Klan membership, in 1926, Evans organized a Klan parade in Washington, D.C., hoping that a large turnout would demonstrate the Klan's power. About 30,000 members attended, making it the largest parade in the group's history. Evans was disappointed, however, as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> double the attendance and the march did not stanch the drop in membership. That year, Evans attempted to rally U.S. senators to vote against a bill supporting a proposed world court. He was unsuccessful, however, and several Klan-backed senators followed Calvin Coolidge and supported the bill. In 1928, Evans opposed the candidacy of the New York Democratic governor Al Smith for president, emphasizing the threat of Smith's Catholic faith. After the Republican Herbert Hoover won the election, Evans boldly claimed responsibility for Smith's loss; {{but most of the}} solidly Democratic South had rejected Hoover and voted for Smith against the Klan's advice.|$|E

5|$|Suqami's {{passport}} {{survived the}} crash {{and landed in}} the street below. Soaked in jet fuel, it {{was picked up by}} a passerby who gave it to a New York City Police Department (NYPD) detective shortly before the South Tower collapsed. Investigators retrieved Mohamed Atta's luggage, which had not been loaded onto the flight. In it they found Omari's passport and driver's license, a videocassette for a Boeing757 flight simulator, a folding knife, and pepper spray. In a recording, a few months later in Afghanistan, Al Qaeda's leader, Osama bin Laden, took responsibility for the attack. The attack on the World Trade Center exceeded even bin Laden's expectations: <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> only the floors above the plane strikes to collapse. The flight recorders for Flight11 and Flight175 were never found.|$|E
5|$|The Livonian Order {{used their}} {{alliance}} with Mindaugas {{to gain control}} over Samogitian lands. In 1252 he approved the Order's construction of Klaipeda Castle. Their governance, however, was seen as oppressive. Local merchants could only conduct transactions via Order-approved intermediaries; inheritance laws were changed; and the choices among marriage partners and residencies were restricted. Several pitched battles ensued. In 1259 the Order lost the Battle of Skuodas, and in 1260 it lost the Battle of Durbe. The first defeat encouraged a rebellion by the Semigalians, and the defeat at Durbe spurred the Prussians into the Great Prussian Rebellion, which lasted for 14 years. Encouraged by these developments and by his nephew Treniota, Mindaugas broke peace with the Order. The gains <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> from Christianization had proven to be minor.|$|E
5|$|Having ascertained the {{identity}} of the ships Dance signalled for his merchants to form the line of battle, and continued their heading, while the French closed, but made no move to attack. Dance used the delay to gather his ships together so the stronger East Indiamen stood between the French and the weaker country ships. The merchants continued on towards the straits, followed by Linois, who was trying to gauge the strength of the convoy. There were more ships in the convoy than <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected,</b> and taken in by Dance's manoeuvres and the painted gunports, Linois suspected that several warships were escorting them. He seemed to be confirmed in his suspicions when at dawn on 15 February, both forces raised their colours. Dance ordered the brig Ganges and the four lead ships to hoist Blue Ensigns, {{while the rest of the}} convoy raised Red Ensigns. By the system of national flags then in use in British ships, this implied that the ships with blue ensigns were warships attached to the squadron of Admiral Peter Rainier, while the others were merchant ships under their protection.|$|E
