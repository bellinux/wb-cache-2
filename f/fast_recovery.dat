5|$|Benzodiazepines are {{effective}} as medication given {{a couple of}} hours before surgery to relieve anxiety. They also produce amnesia, which can be useful, as patients may not remember unpleasantness from the procedure. They are also used in patients with dental phobia as well as some ophthalmic procedures like refractive surgery; although such use is controversial and only recommended for those who are very anxious. Midazolam is the most commonly prescribed for this use because of its strong sedative actions and <b>fast</b> <b>recovery</b> time, as well as its water solubility, which reduces pain upon injection. Diazepam and lorazepam are sometimes used. Lorazepam has particularly marked amnesic properties that may make it more effective when amnesia is the desired effect.|$|E

2500|$|At the time, reactor-plant {{operating}} procedures precluded a rapid reactor restart following a scram, {{or even the}} ability to use steam remaining in the secondary system to [...] "drive" [...] the submarine to the surface. After a scram, standard procedure was to isolate the main steam system, cutting off the flow of steam to the turbines providing propulsion and electricity. This was done to prevent an over-rapid cool-down of the reactor. Threshers Reactor Control Officer, Lieutenant Raymond McCoole, was not at his station in the maneuvering room, or indeed on the boat, during the fatal dive. McCoole was at home caring for his wife who had been injured in a household accident—he had been all but ordered ashore by a sympathetic Commander Harvey. McCoole's trainee, Jim Henry, fresh from nuclear power school, probably followed standard {{operating procedures}} and gave the order to isolate the steam system after the scram, even though Thresher was at or slightly below its maximum depth. Once closed, the large steam system isolation valves could not be reopened quickly. Reflecting on the situation in later life, McCoole was sure he would have delayed shutting the valves, thus allowing the boat to [...] "answer bells" [...] and drive itself to the surface, despite the flooding in the engineering spaces. Admiral Rickover later changed the procedure, creating the [...] "Fast Recovery Startup" [...] procedure. The <b>Fast</b> <b>Recovery</b> Startup allows an immediate reactor restart and for steam to be withdrawn from the secondary system in limited quantities for several minutes following a scram.|$|E

50|$|A problem {{occurs with}} New Reno {{when there are}} no packet losses but instead, packets are reordered by more than 3 packet {{sequence}} numbers. When this happens, New Reno mistakenly enters <b>fast</b> <b>recovery,</b> but when the reordered packet is delivered, ACK sequence-number progress occurs and from there until the end of <b>fast</b> <b>recovery,</b> every bit of sequence-number progress produces a duplicate and needless retransmission that is immediately ACKed.|$|E

50|$|Because the timeout timer is reset {{whenever}} there is {{progress in the}} transmit buffer, this allows New Reno to fill large holes, or multiple holes, in the sequence space much like TCP SACK. Because New Reno can send new packets {{at the end of}} the congestion window during <b>fast</b> <b>recovery,</b> high throughput is maintained during the hole-filling process, even when there are multiple holes, of multiple packets each. When TCP enters <b>fast</b> <b>recovery</b> it records the highest outstanding unacknowledged packet sequence number. When this sequence number is acknowledged, TCP returns to the congestion avoidance state.|$|E

Such <b>fast</b> <b>recovery</b> (in the tens to hundreds of milliseconds) in case of failures (e.g., network link or node failure) is achieved through the intelligence embedded in these new optical transport equipment, which allows recovery to be automatic and handled within the network itself as part of the network control plane, without relying on an external network management system.|$|E
