5|$|When Olivia Shakespear died in October 1938 in London, Dorothy asked Pound to {{organize}} the funeral, where he saw their 12-year-old son Omar {{for the first time}} in eight years. He visited Eliot and Wyndham Lewis, who produced a now-famous portrait of Pound reclining. In April 1939 he sailed for New York, believing <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stop</b> America's involvement in World War II, happy to answer reporters' questions about Mussolini while he lounged on the deck of the ship in a tweed jacket. He traveled to Washington, D.C. where he met senators and congressmen. His daughter, Mary, said that he had acted out of a sense of responsibility, rather than megalomania; he was offered no encouragement, and was left feeling depressed and frustrated.|$|E
5|$|Both Idea and Adonis {{were created}} using Master Cages as weapons during the conflict, {{though they were}} only awakened in the present. Only Adonis fully awoke while Idea {{suffered}} an incomplete awakening when found by Pharzuph Division 7 and regressed to a childlike amnesiac state. In addition, Master Laban has been using Pharzuph Division 7 {{to gain access to}} the Master Cages so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stop</b> Adonis and continue the use of Soma energy by destroying the Arethia consciousness. Welt, a new member of Pharzuph Division 7, is contacted by Orpheus, the avatar of the Arethia's true will. Orpheus asks Pharzuph Division 7 through Welt to stop both Laban and Adonis, the latter wishing to bring destruction upon mankind for its treatment of the Arethia. Upon confronting Adonis after traveling to the Soma Ring via the Ring Tower, Pharzuph Division 7 defeat the incarnation of the deranged Arethia energies: with Welt's help, Adonis, Idea, and Orpheus stabilize the Soma flow and pacify the Visitors. Welt is returned to his comrades, but Orpheus, Adonis, and Idea must leave to merge with the Arethia along with the Visitor energies.|$|E
25|$|In prison, Bunker {{continued}} to write. He finally {{had his first}} novel No Beast So Fierce published in 1973, to which Dustin Hoffman purchased the film rights. Bunker was paroled in 1975, having spent eighteen {{years of his life}} in various institutions. While he was still tempted by crime, he now found himself earning a living from writing and acting. He felt that his criminal career had been forced by circumstances; now that those circumstances had changed, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stop</b> being a criminal.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{after that}} you would have thought from his {{appearance}} he would never make a sound again. But--no fear! <b>He</b> <b>could</b> no more <b>stop</b> telling now than <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have <b>stopped</b> living by the mere exertion of his will.' ...|$|R
60|$|Those {{were his}} amazing words. They slipped out. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not <b>stop</b> them.|$|R
60|$|So Morella {{made him}} {{ready for the}} great {{struggle}} as best <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> and, since <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>stop</b> her coming, awaited the arrival of Betty in Seville.|$|R
25|$|After {{becoming}} a {{lieutenant in the}} Argentine Army, Sala started law school {{at the age of}} 18. As a way to get free drinks, he would bet the professional players a Coke that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stop</b> their shots from outside the 18-yard box. His efforts caught the attention of a scout, who, in 1995 signed him as a reserve player for first division powerhouse San Lorenzo. At San Lorenzo, Sala was coached by Hector Baley, goalkeeper for the 1978 Argentine World Cup squad.|$|E
25|$|Chuck Surack {{established}} {{the company in}} 1979 in Fort Wayne, Indiana so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stop</b> being a touring musician. The company originally offered recording services via a remote recording studio in Surack's Volkswagen microbus and a recording studio based out of his home. When the Kurzweil K250 programmable keyboard and sampler was introduced in 1984, Surack became known for his custom K250 sound library and programming skills {{as well as his}} upgrade kits. Surack became a Kurzweil dealer, but his clients were asking for advice regarding other products as well. Surack expanded Sweetwater to become a music retailer whose emphasis was pre- and post-sale customer service. By 1990, with 6 employees and annual sales of $6 million, Sweetwater had outgrown Surack's home and moved into its own commercial building.|$|E
500|$|Tracy {{struggled}} with alcoholism throughout his adult life, an ailment {{that ran in}} his father's side of the family. Rather than being a steady drinker, as commonly thought, he was prone to periods of binging on alcohol. Loretta Young remarked that Tracy was [...] "awful" [...] when he was drunk, and he was twice arrested for his behavior while intoxicated. Because of this bad reaction to alcohol, Tracy regularly embarked on prolonged periods of sobriety, and developed an all-or-nothing routine. Hepburn commented that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stop</b> drinking for [...] "months, even years at a time".|$|E
60|$|But Jonas went on, trundling his wheelbarrow; {{though he}} looked round and told Rollo that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>stop</b> {{to explain it}} to him then.|$|R
6000|$|... "A good breakfast," [...] said Peter, [...] "will {{make a new}} Rabbit of me." [...] You know Peter {{thinks a}} great deal of his stomach. So he began to eat as fast as <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> <b>stopping</b> every other mouthful to look and listen. [...] "I know it's a bad habit to eat fast," [...] said he, [...] "but it's a whole lot worse to have an empty stomach." [...] So he ate and ate and ate as fast as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> make his little jaws go, which is very fast indeed.|$|R
60|$|The guards struggled, {{but with}} four against them could do little or nothing. One, however, had a {{powerful}} pair of lungs, and before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be <b>stopped,</b> set up a loud cry of alarm.|$|R
500|$|Haynes {{ordered a}} one-horsepower marine upright, two-cycle engine from Sintz Gas Engine Company in Grand Rapids, Michigan for $225. Although {{the engine was}} {{intended}} for use on a small boat, Haynes believed it could be adapted for his purposes. The [...] engine arrived {{in the fall of}} 1893. Haynes soon had the device attached to a carriage he built in his kitchen. He found when he started the engine that its vibrations were too severe for the harness it was in, and before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stop</b> the engine it had done considerable damage to the carriage and the floor of his kitchen, and filled the room with smoke.|$|E
500|$|In {{the general}} election, Wetherby faced Republican Court of Appeals judge Eugene Siler. Siler was a {{fundamentalist}} Christian {{who claimed that}} the state government was full of corruption, and only <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stop</b> it. Citing the gambling in Northern Kentucky, bribery accusations against members of Clements' and Wetherby's administrations, and a 1951 scandal involving the University of Kentucky men's basketball team, he referred to Frankfort as [...] "our Nineveh on the Kentucky River". Wetherby countered Siler's accusations of corruption by removing one of the officials accused of bribery from office. He deployed the newly organized Kentucky State Police to counter organized crime in Campbell and Henderson counties. To further discourage crime, he supported legislation to revoke the alcohol licenses of establishments that allowed gambling. Siler's pro-temperance and anti-Catholic views played well in the state's rural areas, but cost him the vote of the growing urban population. Wetherby won the election {{by a vote of}} 346,345 to 288,014.|$|E
2500|$|Cortés {{then decided}} to move his army to Tetzcoco, where he could {{assemble}} and launch the sloops in the creeks flowing into Lake Texcoco. [...] With his main headquarters in Tetzcoco, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stop</b> his forces from being spread too thin around the lake, and there he could contact them where they needed. [...] Xicotencatl the Elder provided Cortés with ten thousand plus Tlaxcalan warriors {{under the command of}} Chichimecatecle. [...] Cortés departed Tlaxcala on the day after Christmas 1520. [...] When his force arrived at the outskirts of Tetzcoco, he was met by seven chieftains stating their leader Coanacotzin begs [...] "for your friendship". [...] Cortés quickly replaced that leader with the son of Nezahualpilli, baptized as Don Hernando Cortés.|$|E
50|$|Shah Jahan did {{everything}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> to <b>stop</b> the planned invasion of Agra. He asked Jahanara {{to use her}} feminine diplomacy to convince Murad and Shuja not to throw their weight {{on the side of}} Aurangzeb.|$|R
60|$|He stopped, {{even as he}} {{had before}} in the parlor in Mount Vernon Street. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> but <b>stop</b> {{in the face of}} such an appeal--and yet the blood beat in his head with a mad joy.|$|R
50|$|He {{appeared}} in Division One {{of the same}} competition in August 2006, though <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>stop</b> Argentina finishing winless {{and bottom of the}} table. Ferguson is an upper-middle order batsman and the first-choice wicket-keeper for the team.|$|R
2500|$|The British {{position}} in Egypt was desperate, the rout from Mersa Matruh {{had created a}} panic in the British headquarters at Cairo, something later called [...] "the Flap". On {{what came to be}} referred to as [...] "Ash Wednesday", at British headquarters, rear echelon units, and the British Embassy, the British frantically burned confidential papers in anticipation of the fall of the city. Auchinleck—although believing <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stop</b> Rommel at Alamein—felt he could not ignore the possibility that he might once more be outmanoeuvred or outfought. He therefore believed that, to maintain his army, plans must be made for the possibility of a further retreat whilst maintaining morale and retaining the support and co-operation of the Egyptians. Defensive positions were constructed west of Alexandria and on the approaches to Cairo while considerable areas in the Nile delta were flooded. The Axis, too, believed that the capture of Egypt was imminent; Italian leader Benito Mussolini—sensing an historic moment—flew to Libya to prepare for his triumphal entry into Cairo.|$|E
60|$|Unfortunately the puppies {{rushed in}} and gobbled {{up all the}} eggs before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stop</b> them.|$|E
60|$|She {{had gone}} on her knees before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stop</b> her, and was gazing imploringly at him, with her hands clasped.|$|E
5000|$|In February 2015, Hadley claimed on {{his show}} that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have <b>stopped</b> the siege by saying [...] "If me a {{broadcaster}} had spoken louder about the three bail decisions on Man Monis, lives would have been saved." ...|$|R
60|$|All {{these people}} might, {{so far as}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> understand, <b>stop</b> payment under this moratorium! That hadn't at first {{occurred}} to him. But, of course, quite probably they might refuse to pay his account when it fell due.|$|R
5000|$|Charles Hoey was {{the first}} to juggle 4 clubs, though <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>stop</b> juggling without dropping. When {{performing}} on stage the curtain had to be closed while he was still juggling so the audience wouldn’t see him drop.|$|R
60|$|She fell {{suddenly}} {{upon her}} knees. Before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stop</b> her, {{she was at}} his feet, her face straining up to his.|$|E
60|$|By way of explanation, Robin {{sprang to}} the ground, and before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stop</b> her had flung {{her arms around}} Dick's neck.|$|E
60|$|The scout saw the redskin's {{intention}} instantly, {{but before}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stop</b> it {{both he and}} his enemy were close to the flames.|$|E
25|$|Less {{well known}} {{is the fact}} that Hunt did not want his commentaries {{broadcast}} in South Africa during the apartheid years but when <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>stop</b> this from happening, he gave his fees to black-led groups working to overthrow apartheid.|$|R
5000|$|For ten years, Nissim, {{believing that}} {{fast breeder reactor}} [...] "can explode with their fast neutrons", did {{everything}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> to <b>stop</b> {{the construction of the}} Superphénix nuclear plant, including training himself for underground guerilla, notably sabotaging electricity pylons with explosives.|$|R
50|$|Although {{wounded in}} the encounter, Judge Dredd found one of the Samurai's shuriken (throwing stars) and {{realised}} that it alone was capable of penetrating Shojun's psionic shield. Although Shojun saw it coming, even <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>stop</b> it and he was killed.|$|R
60|$|Before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stop</b> her, Pelagia {{had sprung}} from her cushions, and thrown {{herself into the}} midst of the {{laughing}} ring of wild beasts.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm so awfully sorry. Good-bye, dear, dear Monsieur Harmost; I shall come on Friday!" [...] And, before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stop</b> her, she was gone.|$|E
60|$|Before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>stop</b> her, Charlotte seized his hand, {{and kissed}} {{it with an}} hysterical fervor of admiration, which {{completely}} deprived him of his presence of mind.|$|E
2500|$|Wiesenthal {{stated the}} {{committee}} {{found no evidence}} that Waldheim took part in any war crimes but was guilty of lying about his military record. The International Committee in February 1988 concluded that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>stop</b> {{what was going on in}} Yugoslavia and Greece even if he knew: ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{these words}} Alonzo {{burst into a}} shout of laughter; but it sounded so harsh and loud that Julia shrank away shuddering. It seemed as if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>stop</b> himself, and the more he laughed the paler the poor girl became, murmuring {{to herself as she}} watched him: ...|$|R
60|$|And {{they would}} do it. And so soon as he had {{recovered}} from his surprise, and a little lessened the bleeding, he would explain to them how they had done it all wrong, and how easily <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have <b>stopped</b> the blow if they had only hit him properly.|$|R
