60|$|After the {{accounts}} given by Barrow, Carmichael, Basil Hall, and W.B. Clarke of the geology of this district, I shall confine {{myself to a}} few observations on the junction of the three principal formations. The fundamental rock is granite (In several places I observed in the granite, small dark-coloured balls, composed of minute scales of black mica in a tough basis. In another place, I found crystals of black schorl radiating from a common centre. Dr. Andrew Smith found, in the interior parts of the country, some beautiful specimens of granite, with silvery mica radiating or rather branching, like moss, from central points. At the Geological Society, there are specimens of granite with crystallised feldspar branching and radiating in like manner.), overlaid by clay-slate: the latter is generally hard, and glossy from containing minute scales of mica; it alternates with, and passes into, beds of slightly crystalline, feldspathic, slaty rock. This clay-slate is remarkable from being in some places (as on the Lion's Rump) decomposed, even to the depth of twenty feet, into a pale-coloured, sandstone-like rock, which has been mistaken, I believe, by some observers, for a separate formation. I was guided by Dr. Andrew Smith to a fine junction at Green Point between the granite and clay-slate: the latter at the distance of {{a quarter of a}} mile from the spot, where the granite appears on the beach (though, probably, the granite is much nearer underground), becomes slightly more compact and crystalline. At a less distance, some of the beds of clay-slate are of a homogeneous texture, and obscurely striped with different zones of colour, whilst others are obscurely spotted. Within a hundred yards of the first vein of granite, the clay-slate consists of several varieties; some compact with a tinge of purple, others glistening with numerous minute scales of mica and imperfectly crystallised feldspar; some obscurely granular, others porphyritic with small, elongated spots of a soft white mineral, which being easily corroded, gives to this variety a vesicular appearance. Close to the granite, the clay-slate is changed into a dark-coloured, laminated rock, having a <b>granular</b> <b>fracture,</b> which is due to imperfect crystals of feldspar, coated by minute, brilliant scales of mica.|$|E

40|$|After {{analyzing}} excavated 17 - 18 th century silk fibers {{through a}} scanning electron microscopy, we disco-vered seven {{different kinds of}} fracture morphology. Using Morton & Hearle fiber fracture morphology, we classified the findings into four different categories. Type I is tensile failure resulting from brittle fracture, <b>granular</b> <b>fracture,</b> and ductile fracture. Type II is fatigue failure caused by tensile fatigue, flex fatigue, and axial split (fibrillation). Type III is bacterial deterioration discovered only in excavated artifacts. Type IV {{is a combination of}} the three above. Humid underground conditions and the infiltration of bacteria caused the fibers to swell and weaken its interfibrillar cohesion. Fractures occur when drying and processing an exca-vated artifact that is already in a fragile condition. Therefore, one must minimize damage through a prompt cleaning process and make sure that the least possible force is exerted on the fabric during any treatmen...|$|E
30|$|The {{statistical}} {{results of}} microfractures observed from thin sections of reservoir intervals {{show that there}} are more structural microfractures and dissolved fractures in KT-I than KT-II, with a surface fracture ratio of 0.04  % and 0.28  %, respectively, that is 2 – 10 times that of KT-II, but the <b>granular</b> <b>fracturing</b> microfractures of KT-II have a higher surface fracture ratio than that of KT-I (Fig.  4). KT-II is tighter and more brittle than KT-I, so macrofractures are richer in KT-II. The statistical results of cores and imaging logging reveal that the linear fracture density is 6.49 /m for KT-II and 3.38 /m for KT-I.|$|R
30|$|During the depositional {{period of}} KT-II, the open {{platform}} water energy changed intermittently, {{leading to the}} alternate deposition of high-energy shoals, low-energy shoals, and inter shoals (the low-lying land between shoals). Nonreservoirs deposited between shoals are tight and strong in resistance to pressure, while reservoirs between shoals are loose and weak in resistance to pressure. Under tectonic stress, the reservoirs of high-energy shoals and low-energy shoals would release pressure first since their particles were breaking up, resulting {{in the formation of}} microfractures; then, the tight nonreservoirs between shoals would form macrofractures. Thus, structural macrofractures of open platform facies carbonate deposition are mostly present in tight nonreservoirs, accounting for 84.4  %, and seldom in low-energy shoals. High-energy shoals are dominated by <b>granular</b> <b>fracturing</b> microfractures.|$|R

40|$|The {{delamination}} fracture behaviour in {{static and}} fatigue loading for T 300 / 914 C composite laminate has been experimentally investigated by MMB test. The composite laminate examined exhibited various crack growth behaviours for different Mixed-Mode rates. The {{results show that}} the total delamination fracture toughness G_c for T 300 / 914 C composite material decreases with increase in Mixed-Mode ratio m. Fractographs of MMB specimens for T 300 / 914 C show that two typical fracture mechanisms. One, the interfacial debonding was combined with deformation of the resin matrix (associated with Mode II failure). Another one was commonly matrix failure indicating relatively good adhesion between fibre and resin. The matrix failure was occurred in interface of the inhomogeneous system and the <b>granular</b> <b>fracture</b> surface was observed. Besides, the fibre breakage observed on the fracture surfaces at m > 1 indicates that the fibre bridging existed in fracture procedure. These features are typical fracture fashion for T 300 / 914 C laminate under Mode I (DCB). Moreover, as the Mode I load increased, the fracture feature of Mode I increased obviously. The transition of fracture mechanism can be observed at m = 1. The delamination growth may be controlled by Mode I loading. The Mode I loading {{plays a major role in}} the delamination failure behaviour of carbon-fibre reinforced composites under Mixed-Mode loading and the influence of Mode I loading on Mode II failure is primarily that it constrains the development of crack-tip plastic deformation (associated with the Mode II contribution). The interaction between Mode I and Mode II loading may be characterised by the interaction parameter (I_i) "M. The delamination fracture behaviour 0 f T 300 / 914 C laminates was compared with the delamination fracture behaviour of T 300 /M 10 and of HAT/ 6376. The difference of the delamination behaviour between T 300 / 914 (or HAT/ 6376) and T 300 /M 10 was that nature of interfacial adhesion between fibre and matrix resin. The delamination growth rates in a wide range of #DELTA#G are not much difference. The delamination growth is discontinuous with the number of cycles depending upon the #DELTA#G value and the material structure. The fatigue crack growth rate associates with the value of strain energy release rate under static loading, although cyclic fatigue crack growth occurs under stresses which would not induce fracture under static loading. As was expected, fatigue crack growth rate for MMB tests lie well between DCB and ENF tests. (orig.)

40|$|Copper {{minerals}} (chrysocolla >> dioptase >> plancheite > tenorite) plus barite and quartz {{occur in}} a small lens of granulite-grade calcite-dolomite marble near Saldán, Córdoba Province (central Argentina, 31 ° 18 ' 50. 7 "S, 64 ° 19 ' 50. 0 "W). The mineralization is hosted in fractures (striking N 30 °E and dipping 78 °W) that were widened by dissolution. Chrysocolla mainly fills fractures. It has variable H 2 O contents but a Cu:Si ratio is always close to 1 : 1. Plancheite forms compact fissure fillings and aggregates of interlocking spherules. Copper is partially replaced by Mg (up to 2. 22 wt. % MgO), with small amounts of Na, K, Ca, Al and Fe also present. Dioptase occurs as prismatic crystals dominated by { 10 1 0 } and { 11 2 1 } that can reach over 2 cm in length, and also as <b>granular</b> <b>fracture</b> fillings. Unit-cell parameters are a 14. 5719 (6), c 7. 7799 (3) Å, V 1430. 7 (1) Å 3 ; refractive indices are ε = 1. 707 (3), ω = 1. 656 (3), with an anomalous small 2 V. Magnesium (up to 0. 15 wt. % MgO) is the only significant substituent. Yellow barite crystals tabular on { 001 } contain traces of Sr. Quartz occurs rarely, as drusy linings. A few cases of botryoidal, opal-like quartz crusts are known. Tenorite forms dark brown masses and stringers included in marble. Very scarce grains of copper sulfides (anilite altering to spionkopite and covellite along rims and cracks) are found scattered in the marble. Copper is partially replaced by Bi (≥ 0. 15 wt. % Bi) and Pb (≥ 0. 16 wt. % Pb). Malachite and brochantite are alteration products of sulfides. Fluid inclusion studies indicate that the minerals precipitated from a single-phase fluid initially at a temperature above 300 °C that cooled to c. 220 °C. Salinity was very low, 0 to 2 wt. % NaCl eq. Isotopic analyses of calcite give d 13 C values of 0. 4 - 0. 9 ‰ PDB and d 18 O values of 17. 1 - 15. 1 ‰ VSMOW, coincident with the isotopic signature of the regional marbles. Calculated values of d 18 O for water in isotopic equilibrium with calcite fall into with the Metamorphic Water Box. The d 34 S values of barite are 3. 6 - 4. 6 ‰ CDT. The mineralization possibly precipitated from fluids of meteoric origin that suffered an oxygen isotope shift due to a very low water/rock ratio. The sulfur source could have been sedimentary or igneous sulfides, or a mixture from two different sources (such as heavy seawater-derived sulfur and light sedimentary sulfides), but not exclusively seawater. Copper was probably scavenged from accessory sulfides scattered in barren marble or orthoamphibolite. The heat source remains unknown...|$|E

Severe testing conditions were applied: a 9 kN load at 2 Hz during 800, 000 cycles, using calf serum as lubricant for wet tests. Only cups of diameter 32 mm tested in dry conditions failed after 254, 000 ± 43, 000 shocks. Examination by scanning electron microscopy revealed intra and inter <b>granular</b> <b>fractures.</b> Heads exhibited two wear stripes with a roughness of (278 ± 30) nm Ra and (9 ± 5) nm Ra for worn and unworn zones respectively. Analysis of retrieved components have reported values of Ra of 200 - 400 nm and 5 nm within the unworn zone. Furthermore a method was developped to measure wear rate of wear stripe on the heads using an optic profilometer. Average volumetric wear for heads tested in calf serum after 800, 000 cycles was 0. 2 mm 3 from weight loss and 0. 4 mm 3 using the profilometer. Moreover, these results are congruent with those reported from retrieved components.

30|$|In {{the arid}} and {{semi-arid}} regions of southern India, Peninsular Gneissic Complex (PGC) type aquifers are dominant (CGWB 2012). They are formed {{on the base}} of migmatites, granite gneiss and granites ranging in composition from granodiorite to tonalite and intruded younger dolerites. These abundant granitoid rocks are of calc-alkaline nature (Balakrishnan et al. 1990; 1999; Krogstad et al. 1991). Sanukitioids, a high Mg, high Ni granitoids are also present and monoclinic series of amphiboles tremolite, actinolite comprising Ca, Mg and halogens (F, Cl) occur as intrusive with the PGCs. Being of Archean age, the south Indian Peninsula has long been exposed to weathering agents and the rocks have undergone different degrees of secondary decomposition resulting in layers of weathered, semi-weathered zones, as well as massive fractured rocks and fissures, cracks and joints. The fracture zones are hydraulically connected with the overlying weathered and saturated residuum (CGWB 2009) and upon weathering they result in salts rich in calcium, magnesium, sodium, fluoride and chlorides. Hydrogeologically, the subsurface of this region can be characterised by three distinct layer systems viz., soil zone, weathered zone and massive rock layers zone. Thickness of the soil zone varied from 0.16 to 3  m and is comparatively thicker in the northern, north-western and north-eastern boundaries of the study area due to basaltic alluvial depositions. The granite-gneiss lacks primary porosity and occurrence of groundwater is limited to secondary porosity developed by weathering and fracturing (CGWB 1975). The diameter of waterwells is 15 – 20 cm and their depth varied from 40 to 160 m. The thickness of weathered zone ranged from 3 to 15 m with <b>granular</b> <b>fractured</b> zones occuring at 20 – 60 m below ground level. The yield of water wells ranged from 0.11 to 0.18  m 3 per minute.|$|R
40|$|The Discrete Element Method is a {{numerical}} technique used to model physical phenomena through the dynamic interactions {{of a large}} number of distinct bodies. The strength of the method lies in its ability to accurately model the behavior of inherently discontinuous media, such as <b>granular,</b> <b>fractured,</b> or powdered materials. The major computational obstacle in discrete element simulation is the automatic detection of contacts between bodies. For large simulations, the complexity of the contact detection process is driven by the general spatial reasoning problem of neighbor searching, in which candidate intersection pairs are selected based on their proximity. Neighbor search algorithms exist that exhibit linear scaling in the number of bodies. These algorithms rely, however, on the assumption of uniformly sized objects. Devaitions from this assuption, inherent in many common physical systems, significantly degrade performance. This thesis presents a new grid-based algorithm which accomodates objects of varying size. A new grid-based neighbor search algorithm, called CGrid, is developed to deal with objects of varying sizes. A generic formulation for any number of dimensions is presented. CGrid scales linearly in the number of bodies, and is less sensitive to object size disparity than existing linear algorithms. By combining performance and robustness, CGrid provides a reliable neighbor search solution for general simulation systems. An architecture for simulation is presented, which is designed to support rapid prototyping and extension development [...] The core architecture provides an infrastructure of generic components for simulation management. The simulation object heirarchy is constructed to address the issues associated with developing extension capabilities, and supporting the wide variety of objects and behaviors which can be employed within the Discrete Element Method. by Eric David Perkins.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} Coulomb {{failure criteria}} for brittle deformation of intact rock and fault gouge. Data are presented from laboratory experiments designed {{to identify the}} critical gouge layer thickness required to effect a transition from the standard Coulomb criterion to a modified failure law (referred to as Coulomb plasticity) appropriate for simple shear of a gouge layer. Experiments were carried out using tension fractures and quartz powder to simulate <b>granular</b> fault gouge. <b>Fractures</b> sheared without gouge obey the standard Coulomb law. A 0. 6 mm-thick gouge layer was required to effect the transition to Coulomb plasticity. I test and reject the hypothesis that fault zone strength and apparent coefficient of internal friction can be predicted from fracture of intact rock simply by accounting for differences in the failure laws and without considering variations in the Coulomb parameters. The data presented indicate that the stress state required for Coulomb plasticity is not developed within very thin gouge layers. This work implies that brittle fault zones have lower friction than predictions based {{on the strength of}} intact rock. However, the magnitude of this weakening effect is small (for example, a coefficient of sliding friction of 0. 75 would be reduced to 0. 6) and thus it is not an independent explanation of the apparent weakness of mature faults...|$|R

During their manufacturing, processing, transport and use, granular {{materials are}} subjected to various kinds of loadings. If the amplitude of the loading is above the strength threshold, particles constituting <b>granular</b> materials may <b>fracture.</b> It is very important to understand the failure of particles under these loading conditions to prevent or control their failure during all stages of their manufacturing and use. Better characterization of the fracture behavior of particles composed of different materials and sizes will allow more precise application and better maintenance of granular materials in commercial usage. The effects of size and material properties on the deformation and <b>fracture</b> behavior of <b>granular</b> particles are studied by investigating particles from three different size ranges for three different materials. The mechanical behavior is characterized by force-displacement and stress-strain plots under quasi-static compression (strain rate = 10 - 2 s- 1).

It was observed that the smaller particles break at lower forces but actually withstand higher stress at fracture. The calculated Weibull moduli for different size range and materials show that the flaw population from the manufacturing process is different for different sizes and materials.

40|$|The current {{manner of}} {{constructing}} roads with virgin aggregates is unsustainable for many urban centers as natural sources for quality aggregates are being {{or have been}} depleted. As well, there is little understanding or scientific data published as to the impacts on roadway design and life cycle performance with poorer quality aggregate material. To improve future sustainability of roadway utility, {{there is a need}} for better understanding of the mechanistic behavior of road aggregates and their respective role in road structural performance in the field. As well, there is a need to find more sustainable sources of quality aggregates to construct roadways. The goal of this research is to improve road utility sustainability through a better understanding of life cycle performance and incorporating field state mechanistic principles in the initial design of the roadway structure. The primary objective of this research was to investigate the application of recycle rubble materials using a mechanistic materials characterization and structural design process for urban roadways within typical City of Saskatoon roads and field state conditions. Specific technical objectives of this research were to characterize various recycled aggregate materials with regards to their road structural behavior as a high quality base coarse, quantify the cost comparison between various design cross sections, and evaluate the structural behavior of these alternate aggregate sources in typical structural designs and Saskatoon field state conditions. To validate the field behavior of recycled aggregates, various test sections were constructed with different recycled and virgin aggregate structural systems. These test sections were evaluated using non-destructive structural assessment to determine their structural quality in the field. This research studied the use of recycled portland cement concrete aggregates and recycled asphalt cement aggregates as structural granular layers of typical City of Saskatoon roadways. These materials were characterized using conventional and mechanistic lab characterization protocols. Field test sections were constructed to validate that recycled materials could be employed as quality replacements for virgin aggregates. Research was also conducted on how to incorporate mechanistic based materials testing and structural design into City of Saskatoon Design and Materials Selection Specifications and Processes. The resilient modulus of the various road materials was also compared to relate to other mechanistic-empirical design methodologies. The laboratory testing conducted in this research indicated that although conventional empirical testing shows recycled asphalt materials to be of lesser quality, when evaluated using mechanistic characterization protocols, recycled asphalt concrete material yielded superior structural behavior. To illustrate, the dynamic modulus of recycled asphalt concrete was 697 MPa under a fully reversed stress state and a frequency of 0. 5 Hz compared to 264 MPa for a high quality conventional high <b>fracture</b> <b>granular</b> base under the same stress state and frequency. As well, the recycled asphalt material showed less moisture susceptibility than conventional granular aggregate. This research showed recycled portland cement concrete aggregate materials showed good drainage and capillary break qualities when tested against the standard granular base materials. Although the well graded recycled asphalt cement and well graded recycled portland cement concrete were shown to have slightly higher moisture intake values, the increased moisture did not increase the swell and therefore indicates adequate frost resistance due to moisture. This research showed conventional roadway design utilized by the City of Saskatoon does not have the means to evaluate recycled asphalt and portland cement aggregates from a materials selection and structural design perspective. Roadway designs using a mechanistic approach were able to accurately represent the field structural primary responses of test roadway structures considered in this study and were able to incorporated recycled aggregate in the design process. Designing roads using a mechanistic design process showed a significant improvement in roadway structural responses in designs using recycled aggregate material. From an economic perspective, this research showed road cross sections utilizing recycle aggregate materials proved to be the least expensive option when evaluated by the initial capital cost and the projected life cycle costing. When comparing primary structural responses to construction cost, up to 20 percent of costs to construct a road can be saved, and a properly designed road structure using recycled aggregates will reduce the strains in the structures by up to 90 percent. As well, using recycled aggregates to construct roadways will reduce the fuel consumption during construction by up to 20 percent due to a reduction in aggregate hauling distances. In summary, when evaluated with a mechanistic road structural design method that accounts for the material characteristics of various aggregates, recycled asphalt rubble processed as a black base and recycled portland cement concrete as a stress dissipating drainage layer within the construction of new roadways is a more sustainable approach to designing and constructing structurally sound roads than the conventional methods. Based on the findings of this research, proper stockpiling and recycling of asphalt and concrete rubble materials is recommended in the City of Saskatoon. In order to optimize and incorporate various recycled aggregate materials into road design it is recommended the City of Saskatoon employ mechanistic based road material characterization and structural design...|$|R
