5|$|Pitch darkness. <b>Every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then, an {{explosion}} in the night. They had orders to fire on any who could not keep up. Their fingers on the triggers, they did not deprive themselves of this pleasure. If one of us had stopped for a second, a sharp shot finished off another filthy son of a bitch.|$|E
5|$|Realizing how {{important}} Toby is to her, Sarah gives him Lancelot {{and returns to}} her room. After she hears her father and stepmother come in, she sees her friends {{in the mirror and}} realizes even though she is growing up, she still needs them in her life <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> again. In an instant, a number of the major characters from the Labyrinth appear in her room for a raucous celebration, and she reunites with Hoggle, Ludo, Didymus, and Ambrosius. As they celebrate, Jareth, in his owl form, watches from outside and then flies away into the night.|$|E
60|$|She was in {{the mood}} for sounds of <b>every</b> kind <b>now,</b> <b>and</b> {{strained}} her ears to catch the faintest, in wayward enmity to her quiet of mind. Another soon came.|$|R

5|$|A. V. M. Rajan portrayed Shanmugasundaram's brother Thangarathnam. According to playwright Crazy Mohan, Gopulu's {{caricature}} {{of the character}} Vaithi in Subbu's novel was similar to Nagesh, who portrayed Vaithi in the film. Manorama played the wildly expressive, loud-talking but tender-hearted folk dancer Karuppayi, who has to contend with living under the shadows of landlords; she changes her identity <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then to escape from them. In an interview with Maalai Malar, Manorama stated that she was initially nervous acting in front of Ganesan and Balaiah, but Nagarajan assured her that whenever her character appeared {{she would be the}} centre of attention, which gave her the confidence to play her role. Serial and theatre artist M. L. Bhanumathi played the nurse who treats Shanmugasundaram. Other supporting actors included K. Sarangkapani, S. Ramarao, M. K. Murthy, Balusundaram, T. N. Sivadhanu, S. R. Dasarathan, Sivasooriyan, Senthamarai, Kallapart Natarajan, Gundu Karuppaiah, Chandranbabu, S. V. Rajagopal, A. M. Maruthappa, Udayachandrika, Ambika and Kalpalatha.|$|E
5|$|Gossip, {{with his}} long, flowing beard, {{looks like one}} of the old-time monks. He has a good-shaped cranium, bald at the top, and is a little above the medium height.... He {{believes}} himself {{to be one of the}} greatest chessplayers in the world, and thinks that if everything had gone on to his liking he could have beaten all the champions at the tournament. He is a deliberate player, but <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then he takes a nip from a flask of brandy that generally stands on his table. He complained that his chair was too low, and he once attributed a defeat to that. Finally, he got a large ledger and sat upon it. He did, in fact, seem to derive some inspiration from its contents, for he played two or three excellent games afterward.|$|E

25|$|While naval battles are {{not often}} recounted {{since there was}} no {{distinction}} between the navy and the army in ancient Egypt, we do gather some information <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then of battles that were fought through the use of ships.|$|E
50|$|On the CD sleeve for CD1, the {{following}} tracks were crossed out, track 5, <b>Every</b> Day <b>Now</b> <b>and</b> track 7, A Prayer For You. There were also some spelling errors, Future Is Promises being titled Future Is Promised and The Thrill Has Gone being titled The Truth Is Gone on track 6 but correctly titled for track 1.|$|R

50|$|Approximately 2,500 {{copies of}} the Campus are printed every issue. In recent years, the Campus {{published}} a 20-page full color edition on Mondays and a 16-page spot color edition on Thursdays. Now, with the new broadsheet format, the paper's length varies. In addition to the new size, the paper is printed in color <b>every</b> issue <b>now</b> <b>and,</b> depending on its length, may be divided into separate sections.|$|R
25|$|Historic {{treatments}} for RA have also included: rest, ice, compression and elevation, apple diet, nutmeg, some light exercise <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then, nettles, bee venom, copper bracelets, rhubarb diet, extractions of teeth, fasting, honey, vitamins, insulin, magnets, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the churches}} relied on hand-clapping and foot-stomping as rhythmic accompaniment. There would be guitars and tambourines {{available}} <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then, but not frequently. Church choirs became a norm only after emancipation. Most of the singing was done a cappella.|$|E
25|$|Uptown Shah Alam {{is located}} in Section 24 near the LKSA highway. It is a very popular place for locals where {{it is more than}} just a flea market. There are food stalls and events such as concert and games <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then.|$|E
60|$|<b>Every</b> body <b>now</b> paused, <b>and</b> {{looked on}} Christie in astonishment, until the Sub-Prior, who had {{hitherto}} avoided communication with him, {{came up and}} required earnestly to know, whether he meant really to maintain that Halbert Glendinning lived.|$|R
60|$|The {{girls were}} trying on shoes on <b>every</b> side <b>now,</b> <b>and</b> they had {{dispensed}} with the formality of going in-doors for the purpose. More than one put out her {{foot to the}} clerk for his opinion of the fit, and the shoeman was mingling with the crowd, testing with his hand, advising from his professional knowledge, suggesting, urging, {{and in some cases}} artfully agreeing with the reluctance shown.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, it's {{work one}} does not get deadly sick of, {{as if there was}} no making one's self do it,' said Leonard, eagerly; 'it is work! and besides, here is {{sunshine}} and sea. I can get a sight of that <b>every</b> day; <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then I can get a look into the bay, and Weymouth--looking like the old time.' That was his first sorrowful intonation; but the next had the freshness of his age, 'And there are thistles!' ...|$|R
25|$|No {{language}} {{is difficult for}} those who speak it. Difficulty appears when two conditions are met: the standard language diverges from the vernacular and a speaker of the vernacular tries to learn the standard version. This divergence is the precise reason why spelling and grammar reforms happen <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then.|$|E
25|$|Kiritimati's lagoon and the saltflats are a prime {{location}} for migratory birds to stop over or even stay all winter. The most commonly seen migrants are ruddy turnstone (Arenaria interpres), Pacific golden plover (Pluvialis fulva), bristle-thighed curlew (Numenius tahitiensis) and wandering tattler (Tringa incana); other seabirds, waders and even dabbling ducks can be encountered <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then.|$|E
25|$|Brigham Young formalized and anointed these assassins as the Danites, {{whose mission}} {{included}} espionage, suppression of information, and quietly, permanently disposing {{of people who}} threatened the Mormon prophet or the Latter-day Saint organization. Again, not many Mormons know this detail of Church history, but <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then, Utah papers record murders with uniquely Mormon flavoring (death by temple-sanctioned methods, for example), and the word that goes out on the Latter-day grapevine is Danite.|$|E
60|$|From {{behind and}} below came {{the roar of}} machinery, rolls of wet proofs came {{flooding}} into the room at <b>every</b> moment. <b>Now</b> <b>and</b> then a hansom set down a belated reporter, who passed swiftly in to his work, taking off his coat as he went. Outside the sparrows began to chirp, dawn lightened the sky, and strange gleams of light stole into the vast room. Then suddenly from Douglas's desk came a sound.|$|R

"She looks higher," [...] {{replied the}} other, mysteriously; [...] "she's always reading them romantic books full o' love tales, and she's never tired o' talking {{of a girl}} her mother used to know that went {{on the stage and}} married a baronet. She goes and sits in the best parlor <b>every</b> {{afternoon}} <b>now,</b> <b>and</b> calls it the drawing-room. She'll sit there till she's past the marrying age, and then she'll turn round and blame me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "See, dear Charles," [...] cried Julia, in a {{burst of}} what she would call natural feeling--"there is our house--here the summer-house, and there the little arbour where you read to us last week Scott's new novel--how delightful! <b>every</b> thing <b>now</b> seems <b>and</b> feels like home." ...|$|R
25|$|Contrary to the mythology, {{the early}} {{moments of the}} March—getting there—was no picnic. People were afraid. We didn't know what we would meet. There was no precedent. Sitting across from me was a black preacher with a white collar. He was an AME preacher. We talked. <b>Every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then, people on the bus sang 'Oh Freedom' and 'We Shall Overcome,' {{but for the most}} part there wasn't a whole bunch of singing. We were {{secretly}} praying that nothing violent happened.|$|E
25|$|Although mostly nocturnal, {{they are}} {{occasionally}} active during the day. However, like deer, bongos may exhibit crepuscular behaviour. Bongos are both timid and easily frightened; after a scare, a bongo moves away at considerable speed, even through dense undergrowth. Once they find cover, they stay alert and face {{away from the}} disturbance, but peek <b>every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then to check the situation. The bongo's hindquarters are less conspicuous than the forequarters, and from this position the animal can quickly flee.|$|E
25|$|The Pequod gams {{next with}} the Bachelor, a Nantucket ship heading home full of sperm oil. <b>Every</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then, the Pequod lowers for whales with success. On {{one of those}} nights in the whaleboat, Fedallah prophesies that neither hearse nor coffin can be Ahab's, that before he dies, Ahab must see two hearses — one not made by mortal hands and the other made of American wood — that Fedallah will precede his captain in death, and finally that only hemp can kill Ahab.|$|E

6000|$|She {{had been}} {{listening}} intensely, exculpating him at <b>every</b> point, <b>and</b> <b>now</b> his innocence all flashed upon her. [...] "I see! I see!" [...] she cried. [...] "And it was because you had never tasted it before--" ...|$|R
60|$|Things ran along, {{a tournament}} nearly <b>every</b> week; <b>and</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then the boys used to {{want me to}} take a hand--I mean Sir Launcelot and the rest--but I said I would by and by; no hurry yet, and too much {{government}} machinery to oil up and set to rights and start a-going.|$|R
