40|$|The rates, {{and some}} derived parameters, of {{reaction}} of three heavy atom neutral nucleophiles (thiourea, N-acetylthiourea, and selenourea) with 1 -fluoro- and 1 -chloro- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene are measured {{and used to}} estimate (a) the mobilities of fluorine relative to chlorine, an important mechanistic feature of the usual (addition-elimination) SNAr reactions; and (b) {{the strength of the}} reagents. Results are compared with those for a range of neutral and anionic light (Periodic <b>Table</b> <b>first</b> <b>row)</b> and heavy atom (Periodic Table second or higher row) nucleophiles. Results for 1 -iodo- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene are included where available. A marked reduction in F:Cl mobility ratios (which are matched by F:heavy halogen ratios), well known in following a sequence from light to heavy atom anionic nucleophiles, is now shown to occur also with neutral nucleophiles...|$|R

This step is to identify the numeric facts that will populate each fact <b>table</b> <b>row.</b> This step is closely related to the business users of the system, since this is where they get access to data stored in the data warehouse. Therefore, most of the fact <b>table</b> <b>rows</b> are numerical, additive figures such as quantity or cost per unit, etc.|$|R

50|$|Note {{that only}} step 4 {{of the above}} {{procedure}} produces reduce actions, and so all reduce actions must occupy an entire <b>table</b> <b>row,</b> causing the reduction to occur regardless of the next symbol in the input stream. This is why these are LR(0) parse tables: they don't do any lookahead (that is, they look ahead zero symbols) before deciding which reduction to perform. A grammar that needs lookahead to disambiguate reductions would require a parse <b>table</b> <b>row</b> containing different reduce actions in different columns, and the above procedure is not capable of creating such rows.|$|R

3000|$|FGAC {{granularity}} Let us now {{start to}} consider why the FGAC solutions developed for RDBMSs cannot be reused for the NoSQL scenario. To make the discussion more concrete, {{let us consider}} Oracle VPD, {{one of the most}} popular FGAC solutions developed for RDBMSs. Oracle VPD considers <b>table</b> <b>rows</b> as the finest protection objects. From a data management perspective, <b>table</b> <b>rows</b> of relational databases correspond to documents of document-oriented NoSQL datastores, even though documents model data resources in a less abstract way than rows, as they do not abstract from the intrinsic structure of a resource, and thus they do not require one to flatten the resource content.|$|R

To address this problem, we propose a mapping mechanism that 1) introduces asinglemapping <b>table,</b> with each <b>row</b> holding one key value from the primary B +-tree, as an intermediate structure between the primary B +-tree and the associated auxiliary structures, and 2) augments the primary B +-tree structure to include in each row the physical address of the corresponding mapping <b>table</b> <b>row.</b> The mapping <b>table</b> <b>row</b> addresses can then {{be used in the}} auxiliary structures to indirectly refer to the primary B +-tree rows.
