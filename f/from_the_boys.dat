5|$|James {{became an}} {{unrestricted}} free agent at 12:01am EDT on July 1, 2010. During this time, he was contacted by several teams, including the Bulls, Los Angeles Clippers, Miami Heat, New York Knicks, New Jersey Nets, and Cavaliers. On July 8, he announced on a live ESPN special titled The Decision {{that he would}} sign with the Heat. The telecast was broadcast <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Boys</b> & Girls Club of Greenwich, Connecticut and raised $2.5 million for the charity. An additional $3.5 million was raised from advertising revenue, which was donated to other charities. The day before the special, fellow free agents Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade had also announced that they would sign with Miami; reports later arose that back in 2006 the trio had discussed among themselves their upcoming 2010 free agencies. James decided to join with Bosh and Wade in part {{so that he could}} shoulder less of the offensive load; he thought that his improved teammates would give him a better chance of winning an NBA championship than had he stayed in Cleveland. Heat president Pat Riley {{played a major role in}} selling James on the idea of playing with Bosh and Wade. James would be relieved of the burden of scoring, and he thought he could be the first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple-double in a season.|$|E

25|$|Bosco and his oratory {{moved around}} {{town for a}} number of years; he was turned out of several places in succession. After only two months based in the church of St. Martin, the entire {{neighborhood}} expressed its annoyance with the noise coming <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> at play. A formal complaint was lodged against them with the municipality. Rumors also circulated that the meetings conducted by the priest with his boys were dangerous; their recreation could be turned into a revolution against the government. The group was evicted.|$|E

25|$|During the Triwizard Tournament, Fleur is {{initially}} aloof and unfriendly despite receiving much admiration <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys,</b> especially Ron. During the second {{task of the}} Tournament, she attempts to rescue her sister Gabrielle Delacour from the lake, but fails, hindered by the Grindylows. When Harry rescues Gabrielle instead, Fleur is extremely grateful, despite her sister being in no real danger, and becomes much warmer towards both Harry and Hogwarts. Fleur takes last place in the Triwizard Tournament due to being Stunned during the last task.|$|E
500|$|The film {{begins with}} an {{introduction}} to the documentary <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys.</b> Nat and Alex Wolff, aged nine and six respectively, are members of the fictional band The Silver Boulders, which also consists of Thomas, David, Josh, and their manager Cooper. The band found success after a music executive (John B. Williams) signed them to his label, Who's the Man Records. The band performs their new song [...] "Motormouth" [...] at a concert in the Hammerstein Ballroom. After the show, the band members describe how their group started and a clip from their music video [...] "Crazy Car" [...] is shown.|$|E
500|$|Scherzinger then {{returned}} {{as a guest}} judge on the third day, where each act performed one song {{from a list of}} 40. On the fifth day, Scherzinger suggested that the Over-25s category be changed to Over 28s, as the quality of older singers was high. The Boys and Girls categories then comprised singers aged 16 to 28, rather than 16 to 25. As the groups category was the weakest, five rejected soloists <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Boys</b> category and four from the Girls category were asked to form two groups, One Direction and Belle Amie [...] respectively. After bootcamp, each judge was assigned a category: Cowell was given the Groups, Walsh had the Over-28s, Minogue was asked to look after the Boys and Cole was assigned the Girls.|$|E

500|$|Streisand {{takes them}} to her condo in the mountains, where she ties the boys up and tortures them with her singing voice. Cartman relents and gives up the {{triangle}}. Streisand uses the triangle to complete the diamond, transforming herself into a giant mechanical dinosaur version of herself, Mecha-Streisand, and begins to lay waste to South Park with her new form. Maltin and Chef arrive to free the boys, and Maltin asks Chef to call Robert Smith of The Cure [...] for help. Maltin then transforms into a giant robot to battle Mecha-Streisand, but is quickly defeated. The boys evade fiery debris from the fight, but Kenny is killed when he stops to play tetherball and gets strangled by the rope. Actor Sidney Poitier arrives and turns into a giant fanged turtle to fight Mecha-Striesand, but he too is easily defeated. After getting a call <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> and Chef, Robert Smith arrives and transforms into a giant moth creature.|$|E
500|$|Originally, Parker and Stone {{considered}} {{making a}} full-length episode of The Queef Sisters. The duo had pulled a similar stunt {{with the second}} season premiere. Instead of the expected follow-up to [...] "Cartman's Mom Is a Dirty Slut", in which the identity of Cartman's father was to be revealed, Parker and Matt Stone showed the episode [...] "Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus", a Terrance and Phillip-centered episode as an April Fools' Day prank. Since [...] "Eat, Pray, Queef" [...] was coincidentally also set to air on April Fools' Day, they considered a similar joke revolving around Katherine and Katie. However, since [...] "Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus" [...] infuriated South Park fans at the time, they decided {{not to do it}} and wrote a full script for [...] "Eat, Pray, Queef" [...] instead. The original prank is referenced in the episode, when The Canada Channel announces that it will not air a much-anticipated part two episode of Terrance and Phillip, and instead will show the Queef Sisters as an April Fools' Day prank. The angry reaction <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> mirrors the real-life fan reaction to the South Park second season premiere.|$|E

2500|$|... "The Seduction of the Ring": a slow, melancholic {{variation}} of the ring theme, sung by choir. The associated lyrics first appear with a mixed choir when Gandalf finds the account of Isildur. The first proper appearance (when Gandalf warns Frodo never to surrender to the Ring temptation and put it on) is hummed by a boy choir, and later sung when Boromir is tempted. In the Return of the King, it returns when Deagol first finds it, moving <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> to the women choir.|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, the AGSV and the APS coordinated {{to form a}} {{combined}} AGSV/APS girls' sport program. This was mainly done to provide opportunities for fair competition to female students of schools from both associations. Of the twenty AGSV/APS schools, twelve are co-educational, eight are boys-only and none are girls-only. As such, most of the sporting competitions are dominated by boys and the opportunities for girls' sport are relatively limited in both associations. The AGSV/APS girls competition runs for the Summer and Winter seasons (not applying to the Athletics, Swimming or other sport that is contested outside the main seasons) and is separate <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> competition, which remains AGSV-only.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were several}} camps on the famous birthplace of Scouting, {{including}} a Sunrise Camp, a Replica Camp, and a New Centenary Camp. The replica camp was held twice, each 4.5 days camping {{running around the}} August celebrations. The activities included historical 1907 activities, several with a modern twist. The first of the replica camp's was for purely Boy Scouts and the second included a patrol of girls. As well as Scouts there were boys <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Boys</b> Brigade, as in the original 1907 camp. [...] The changes made to the modern Brownsea Camp did not always draw positive attention in the media, some reports suggesting that elements of the original spirit of Scouting had been lost.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{subsequent}} critics, Ernest Hemingway among them, have deprecated {{the final}} chapters, claiming the book [...] "devolves into {{little more than}} minstrel-show satire and broad comedy" [...] after Jim is detained. Although Hemingway declared, [...] "All modern American literature comes from" [...] Huck Finn, and hailed it as [...] "the best book we've had", he cautioned, [...] "If you must read it you must stop where the Nigger Jim is stolen <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> [...] That is the real end. The rest is just cheating." [...] Pulitzer Prize winner Ron Powers states in his Twain biography (Mark Twain: A Life) that [...] "Huckleberry Finn endures as a consensus masterpiece despite these final chapters", in which Tom Sawyer leads Huck through elaborate machinations to rescue Jim.|$|E
2500|$|Antonio {{was raised}} in Port Melbourne, Victoria, a working class suburb of Melbourne. [...] Her father was a Chilean docker of French and Spanish descent who {{died when she was}} 15 months. [...] With the {{encouragement}} of her uncle she learnt her cricket <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> in her neighbourhood streets. [...] As a young girl during the Great Depression, she was lucky enough to find work at a shoe factory in the industrial suburb of Collingwood. [...] The factory was home to a women's cricket team where Antonio {{came to the attention of}} Eddie Conlon, a club cricketer with an encyclopaedic knowledge of the game. [...] With the assistance of Conlon, Antonio developed a rare mix of leg spin and off spin, including a top spinner and a wrong'un.|$|E
2500|$|The {{writer of}} Record Mirrors initial review found the album lacking {{some of the}} variety of the group's {{previous}} releases but also said: [...] "one marvels and wonders at the constant stream of melodic ingenuity stemming <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys,</b> both as performers and composers. Keeping up their pace of creativeness is quite fantastic." [...] By contrast, a week later, Richard Green wrote in the same magazine that most of the album [...] "if recorded by anyone but the Beatles, would not be worthy of release", with many of the tracks devoid of [...] "the old Beatles excitement and compulsiveness". Green acknowledged that his was an unpopular opinion, before concluding: [...] "Judging LPs strictly on their merits, recent albums from Manfred Mann, the Beach Boys and Jerry Lee Lewis rank high above Rubber Soul." ...|$|E

Shue explained her reason for doing so in a 2007 interview. [...] "There was no other choice back then," [...] she pointed out to the interviewer. [...] "There was no girls team to play on." [...] Shue continued to play on the team till 1976, when she turned 13. Of her decision to leave the team, Shue stated, [...] "the movie is really {{what would have happened if}} I hadn’t quit [...] I quit because of what people would think of me. The pressure <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys.</b> The awkward development of my body. I really, really regret it. I wish I’d been brave enough." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon Simpson's rise {{to stardom}} {{with the success}} of Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica in 2003, Simpson was seen as a [...] "ditzy blonde" [...] based on her antics and {{comments}} on the show. The show also revealed that Simpson had, in fact, waited until marriage to have sex; she recorded the song [...] "Sweetest Sin" [...] (2003) about losing her virginity to Lachey. While Simpson continued to achieve further success, she became known as a sex symbol by the media. Simpson was ranked at number fifty-three on the Maxim Hot 100 list in 2001. She topped the list in 2004, ranked at the [...] "hottest" [...] female of the year. Simpson was quoted as stating [...] "It's nice to get the stamp of approval <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> [...] it's way better than being number 101!" [...] The following year, she ranked in at number nine on the list. In 2006, she appeared on the list at number eighteen. Simpson was {{on the cover of the}} magazine that year as well. Simpson's portrayal of Daisy Duke furthered her sex symbol image, most notably when she portrayed the character in her highly controversial [...] "These Boots Are Made For Walkin" [...] music video. Simpson appeared as the character in several television commercials for Pizza Hut airing during the Super Bowl in 2006 and 2007. She also portrayed the character in adverts for DirecTV.|$|E
