50|$|In 1955 (as a 1956 package), Ford offered lap only {{seat belts}} {{in the rear}} seats as an option within the Lifeguard safety package. In 1967, Volvo started to install lap belts in the rear seats. In 1972, Volvo {{upgraded}} the rear seat <b>belts</b> to <b>a</b> <b>three-point</b> <b>belt.</b>|$|R
50|$|To {{secure the}} riders on their seats, each car is {{equipped}} with <b>a</b> <b>three-point</b> safety <b>belt</b> <b>for</b> the rider and <b>a</b> lap belt <b>for</b> the passenger. Tracks also have safety nets, especially on steep curves, as a precaution.|$|R
5000|$|A 3-point belt is a Y-shaped arrangement, {{similar to}} the {{separate}} lap and sash belts, but unitized. Like the separate lap-and-sash belt, in a collision the 3-point belt spreads out {{the energy of the}} moving body over the chest, pelvis, and shoulders. Volvo introduced the first production <b>three-point</b> <b>belt</b> in 1959. The first car with <b>a</b> <b>three-point</b> <b>belt</b> was <b>a</b> Volvo PV 544 that was delivered to a dealer in Kristianstad on August 13, 1959. However, the first car model to feature the <b>three-point</b> seat <b>belt</b> as <b>a</b> standard item was the 1959 Volvo 122, first outfitted with a two-point belt at initial delivery in 1958, replaced with the <b>three-point</b> seat <b>belt</b> the following year. The <b>three-point</b> <b>belt</b> was developed by Nils Bohlin who had earlier also worked on ejection seats at Saab. [...] Volvo then made the new seat belt design patent open in the interest of safety and made it available to other car manufacturers for free.|$|R
50|$|Each seat is {{fitted with}} <b>a</b> <b>three-point</b> {{seatbelt}} with <b>belt</b> tensioner and force limiter and an adjustable head restraint.|$|R
50|$|This has {{led many}} {{countries}} to adopt mandatory seat belt wearing laws. It is generally accepted that, in comparing like-for-like accidents, a vehicle occupant not wearing a properly fitted seat belt has a significantly and substantially higher chance of death and serious injury. One large observation studying using US data showed that the odds ratio of crash death is 0.46 with <b>a</b> <b>three-point</b> <b>belt,</b> when compared with no belt. In another study that examined injuries presenting to the ER pre- and post-seat belt law introduction, {{it was found that}} 40% more escaped injury and 35% more escaped mild and moderate injuries.|$|R
50|$|Starting in 1971 {{and ending}} in 1972, the United States {{conducted}} {{a research project}} on seat belt effectiveness on a total of 40,000 vehicle occupants using car accident reports collected during that time. Of these 40,000 occupants, 18% were reported wearing lap belts, or two-point safety belts, 2% were reported wearing <b>a</b> <b>three-point</b> safety <b>belt,</b> and the remaining 80% was reported as wearing no safety belt. The results concluded that users of the two-point lap belt had a 73% lower fatality rate, a 53% lower serious injury rate, and a 38% lower injury rate, {{when compared with the}} occupants that were reported unrestrained. Similarly, users of the <b>three-point</b> safety <b>belt</b> had <b>a</b> 60% lower serious injury rate and a 41% lower rate of all other injuries. Out of the 2% described as wearing <b>a</b> <b>three-point</b> safety <b>belt,</b> no fatalities were reported.|$|R
40|$|Although {{death is}} a gradual process, {{sometimes}} sudden death occurs in {{a fraction of a}} minute or seconds. Here we report a 49 -year-old man without any underlying disease, which has instantly died in an accident scene due to compression of neck critical elements by <b>a</b> <b>three-point</b> seat <b>belt.</b> The examination of the body and the results of the autopsy, toxicology and pathology tests are described from the viewpoint of forensic medicine...|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to designing <b>an</b> effective <b>three-point</b> <b>belt,</b> Bohlin demonstrated its effectiveness {{in a study}} of 28,000 accidents in Sweden, and presented a paper at the 11th Stapp Car Crash Convention. Unbelted occupants sustained fatal injuries throughout the whole speed scale, whereas none of the belted occupants was fatally injured at accident speeds below 60 mph. No belted occupant was fatally injured if the passenger compartment remained intact. This study resulted in the U.S. Department of Transportation requiring <b>three-point</b> seat <b>belts</b> in American cars. In 1968, the new seat belt design was made free for the public to use. In most industrial countries, occupants are required by law to use seat belts.|$|R

50|$|The {{interior}} {{has been}} upgraded {{as well with}} blue-lit dashboard controls (unlike the green color used in other Hyundai models), a gated shifter pattern, illuminated cup holders, and higher quality leather on Limited models. The rear seat head restraints caused visibility problems in the previous model due to their size. The new style features 'shingled' head rests that when lowered completely, sit flush with {{the top of the}} seat, helping to maximize rear visibility. The middle rear seating position now comes with its own head restraint and <b>a</b> <b>three-point</b> seat <b>belt</b> built in.

50|$|This {{study and}} others {{led to the}} Restraint Systems Evaluation Program (RSEP), started by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in 1975 to {{increase}} the reliability and authenticity of past studies. A study {{as part of this}} program used data taken from 15,000 tow-away accidents that involved only car models made between 1973 and 1975.

The study also concluded that the effectiveness of the safety belt did not differ with size of car. It was determined that the variation among results of the many studies conducted in the 1960s and 70s was due to the use of different methodologies, and could not be attributed to any significant variation in the effectiveness of safety belts.|$|R

The occupant model represents a 5 th percentile female at around the 38 th week of pregnancy. A finite element uterus and multi-body fetus is integrated into an existing female model to incorporate pregnant female anthropometry. The complete model, ‘Expecting’, is used to simulate a range of frontal impacts of increasing severity from 15 km/h to 45 km/h. Three levels of occupant restraint, completely unrestrained, <b>three-point</b> seat <b>belt,</b> and <b>three-point</b> seat <b>belt</b> with <b>an</b> airbag, are investigated. The strains developed in the uterus because of loading from the seat belt and steering-wheel unit are presented, together with an analysis of stress distribution due to inertial loading of the fetus on the uterus. The unrestrained cases are shown to be the most dangerous to the fetus, owing to the large interaction with the vehicle steering wheel {{at the level of the}} placenta. The use of <b>a</b> <b>three-point</b> seat <b>belt</b> together with a driver airbag appears to offer the greatest protection to the fetus...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a novel control strategy for real-time controlled restraint systems. Today’s restraint systems typically include {{a number of}} airbags, and <b>a</b> <b>three-point</b> seat <b>belt</b> with load limiter and pretensioner. In the class of realtime controlled restraint systems, the restraint actuator settings are continuously manipulated during the crash. The control strategy developed here is based on reference management, in which a nonlinear device- a reference governor- is added to a primal closed loop controlled system. This governor determines an optimal setpoint in terms of injury reduction and constraint satisfaction by solving a constrained optimization problem. Prediction of the vehicle motion, required to predict future constraint violation, {{is included in the}} design and is based on linear regression of past crash data. Simulation results with a MADYMO model show that a significant injury reduction is possible, without prior knowledge of the crash. Furthermore, it is shown that the algorithms are sufficiently fast to be implemented on-line. I...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: A novel {{numerical}} {{technique for}} the modelling of interfaces is introduced {{for the analysis}} of reinforced brittle materials. The method exploits the partition of unity property of finite element shape functions. By considering finite element shape functions as partitions of unity, extra degrees of freedom are added to the nodes at the interface between the matrix and reinforcement. A gradient-enhanced damage model is used to simulate the continuum response. Numerical results <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>three-point</b> bending test and a pull-out test are presented. The numerical procedure proposed here is suitable <b>for</b> <b>a</b> great variety of applications ranging from discrete cracking and steel-concrete interaction in concrete to delamination processes in composite materials. ...|$|R
