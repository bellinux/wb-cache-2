This new material has characteristics which are very ditferent {{from those of the}} toughened glasses more generally used in flameproof equipment, and it has been necessary to evaluate its relevant properties. The research work described in this paper covers investigations of mechanical, thermal, optical and physical properties of methacrylate, and the effect of various factors on these properties.
