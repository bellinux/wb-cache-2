40|$|The X ray {{absorption}} {{near edge}} structure (XANES) spectra, at the oxygen K <b>edge,</b> <b>of</b> <b>well</b> characterized silica glasses have been measured using the grasshopper beam {{line at the}} Frascati synchrotron radiation facility. Oxygen XANES are {{shown to be a}} probe of oxygen site geometry of glasses. Multiple scattering calculations of XANES for a simple Si-O-Si cluster have been performed and demonstrate the sensibility of XANES to bonding angles via higher order correlation function of atomic distribution. The feasibility of Si-O-Si bridging bond angle and of Si-O distance determination and indication of different average bridging bond angles in different silica glasses by XANE is reported...|$|E

40|$|Using a two-parameter wave function, we {{calculate}} variationally {{the binding}} energy of an exciton bound to an ionized donor impurity (D+,X) in GaAs-AlxGa 1 -xAs quantum wells for the values <b>of</b> the <b>well</b> width from 10 to 300 Angstrom, when the dopant {{is located in}} the center <b>of</b> the <b>well</b> and at the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the <b>well.</b> The theoretical results confirm that the previous experimental speculation proposed by Reynolds tit al. [Phys. Rev. B 40, 6210 (1989) ] is the binding energy of D+,X for the dopant at the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the <b>well.</b> in addition, we also calculate the center-of-mass wave function of the exciton and the average interparticle distances. The results are discussed in detail...|$|R

60|$|She {{ran from}} him and {{was lost in the}} shadow of the pines, the bracken {{crackling}} beneath her feet as she ran. Her companion followed slowly, and emerging from the gloom saw her poised daintily on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the <b>well</b> with her feet hidden in the rank grass and nettles which surrounded it.

60|$|And being wearied {{with his}} journey, {{he sat down}} upon the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> Jacob's <b>well,</b> by Joseph's tomb. The well is still there, choked with rubbish to this very day; and Joseph's tomb by it, all in ruins, among broad fields of corn. And on the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> that <b>well</b> he sat. Along the very road which was before him, Jeroboam, and Ahab, and many a wicked king of Israel, had gone in old times, {{travelling}} between Shechem and Samaria: along that road the terrible Assyrians had marched back to their own land, leading strings of weeping prisoners out of their pleasant native land, to slavery and misery in the far North. He knew it all; and doubt not that he thought over it all, as never man thought on earth. Doubt not that his heart yearned over these poor ignorant Samaritans, and over the sinful woman who came to draw water at the well. After all, half- heathens as they were, Jacob's blood was in their veins; and if not, were they not still human beings? They were worshipping they knew not what: but still they were worshipping the best which they knew.|$|R
