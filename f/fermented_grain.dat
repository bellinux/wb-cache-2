25|$|Pot {{distilled}} gin represents the earliest style of gin, and is traditionally produced by pot distilling a <b>fermented</b> <b>grain</b> mash (malt wine) from barley or other grains, then redistilling it with flavouring botanicals {{to extract the}} aromatic compounds. The fermentation of grain mash produces a neutral alcohol (similar to vodka) that is predominately tasteless except for the iconic ethyl alcohol taste. A double gin can be produced by redistilling the first gin again with more botanicals. Due {{to the use of}} pot stills, the alcohol content of the distillate is relatively low; around 68% ABV for a single {{distilled gin}} or 76% ABV for a double gin. This type of gin is often aged in tanks or wooden casks, and retains a heavier, malty flavour that gives it a marked resemblance to whisky. Korenwijn (grain wine) and the oude (old) style of Geneva gin or Holland gin represent the most prominent gins of this class.|$|E

500|$|The Whiskey Rebellion (also {{known as}} the Whiskey Insurrection) was a tax protest in the United States {{beginning}} in 1791 during the presidency of George Washington. The so-called [...] "whiskey tax" [...] was the first tax imposed on a domestic product by the newly formed federal government. It became law in 1791, and was intended to generate revenue for the war debt incurred during the Revolutionary War. [...] The tax applied to all distilled spirits, but American whiskey {{was by far the}} country's most popular distilled beverage in the 18th century, so the excise became widely known as a [...] "whiskey tax". Farmers of the western frontier were accustomed to distilling their surplus rye, barley, wheat, corn, or <b>fermented</b> <b>grain</b> mixtures into whiskey. These farmers resisted the tax. In these regions, whiskey often served as a medium of exchange. Many of the resisters were war veterans who believed that they were fighting for the principles of the American Revolution, in particular against taxation without local representation, while the federal government maintained that the taxes were the legal expression of Congressional taxation powers.|$|E

40|$|Ganoderma are {{cosmopolitan}} wood decaying {{white rot}} basidiomycete fungi,which {{have been used}} for centuries for medicinal purposes, particularly in China, Japan and Korea. It is believed to possess many health benefits and has been reported to be effective against various diseases by virtue of their antioxidant potential. In the present study, solid-substrate fermentation of wheat grains with indigenous Ganoderma spp. selected based on ethnomycological knowledge was carried out. The species included Ganoderma australe (Fr.) Pat. (KUM 60813), Ganoderma neo-japonicum Imazeki(KUM 61076) and Ganoderma lucidum (Fr.) Karst. (VITA GL) (a commercial strain). Antioxidant activities of the crude aqueous and ethanol extracts of the unfermented and <b>fermented</b> wheat <b>grains</b> were investigated by the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), 2, 2 ’-azinobis-(3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical scavenging activity, diphenyl- 1 -picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging ability and lipid peroxidation assays. Among the six mycelia extracts tested, the ethanol extract from wheat fermented with KUM 61076 mycelia showed the most potent antioxidant activities whereas, the ethanol extract of wheat <b>grains</b> <b>fermented</b> with KUM 60813 mycelia had good potential to protect palm oil (food grade) against oxidation. Total phenol content (TPC) in the ethanol extracts were higher than that in the aqueous extracts. The antioxidant activities of the mycelia extracts had a positive correlation with their polyphenol contents. These phenolic compounds may {{play a vital role in}} the antioxidant activities of the selected Ganoderma spp. The present study also evaluated the insulin-like properties of extracts of unfermented and <b>fermented</b> wheat <b>grains</b> through lipogenic, lipolytic and adipokine expression. 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes treated with ethanol extract of wheat <b>grains</b> <b>fermented</b> with KUM 61076 mycelia, significantly stimulated lipogenesis (in the absence of insulin) and exerted relatively mild antiiii adrenaline induced lipolytic activities. In general, the expressions of target genes such as adiponectin, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), glucose transporter 4 (GLUT 4) and hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) were up-regulated by the ethanol extract of wheat <b>grains</b> <b>fermented</b> with Ganoderma spp. mycelia. However, both the aqueous and ethanol extracts of unfermented and <b>fermented</b> wheat <b>grains</b> demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition of preadipocyte differentiation and reduced the expression level of adiponectin in adipocytes when the cells were subjected to oxidative stress. In conclusion, these results suggest that wheat <b>grains</b> <b>fermented</b> with Ganoderma spp. especially KUM 60813 and KUM 61076 have good antioxidant and insulin-like properties which may potentially serve as a therapeutic agent in the management of diabetes. To our knowledge this is the first report on antioxidant and insulin-like properties of extracts from wheat <b>grains</b> <b>fermented</b> by Ganoderma spp. mycelia...|$|R

50|$|A {{distilled}} {{drink or}} liquor is an alcoholic drink produced by distilling (i.e., concentrating by distillation) ethanol produced {{by means of}} <b>fermenting</b> <b>grain,</b> fruit, or vegetables. Unsweetened, distilled, alcoholic drinks that have an alcohol content of at least 20% ABV are called spirits. For the most common distilled drinks, such as whiskey and vodka, the alcohol content is around 40%. The term hard liquor is used in North America to distinguish distilled drinks from undistilled ones (implicitly weaker). Vodka, gin, baijiu, tequila, whiskey, brandy, and soju are examples of distilled drinks. Distilling concentrates the alcohol and eliminates some of the congeners. Freeze distillation concentrates ethanol along with methanol and fusel alcohols (fermentation by-products partially removed by distillation) in applejack.|$|R
