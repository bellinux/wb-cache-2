50|$|Although an {{innovation}} in its structure, the conditional penal bond {{was not the}} first English attempt to impose “fixed monetary penalties” for failure to perform on an agreement.

50|$|Historically, {{the most}} {{significant}} type of penal bond was the penal bond with conditional defeasance. A penal bond with conditional defeasance combined in one document the bond (the promise to pay a specified amount of money) with the contractual obligation. It did this in what the historian Brian Simpson called a ‘topsy-turvy’ fashion by printing the bond {{on the front of}} the document and the condition, whose performance by the obligor would render the bond void (referred to as the indenture <b>of</b> <b>defeasance),</b> on the back.|$|R
50|$|The {{etymology}} of defeasible usually {{refers to}} Middle English law of contracts, where a condition <b>of</b> <b>defeasance</b> is a clause that can invalidate or annul a contract or deed. Though defeat, dominate, defer, defy, deprecate and derogate {{are often used}} in the same contexts as defeasible, the verbs annul and invalidate (and nullify, overturn, rescind, vacate, repeal, debar, void, cancel, countermand, preempt, etc.) are more properly correlated with the concept of defeasibility than those words beginning with the letter d. Many dictionaries do contain the verb, to defease with past participle, defeased.|$|R

40|$|This paper hypothesizes {{and tests}} the {{argument}} that a defeasance transaction initiates a wealth transfer from stockholders to bondholders. The authors empirical tests provide compelling evidence of bondholder gains, but no support for shareholder losses when a firm defeases debt. They speculate that the insignificance of the loss to shareholders is primarily due to the size disparity between the value of defeased debt and {{the market value of}} outstanding equity, since the suggested economic merits <b>of</b> <b>defeasance</b> appear unfounded. Although they cannot prove an agency motivation for defeasance, they find a very high correlation between compensation tied to earnings and defeasing debt at book gain.
