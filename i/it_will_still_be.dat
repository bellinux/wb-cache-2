LISA's design calls for three test masses forming an {{equilateral}} triangle, with lasers from each spacecraft to each other spacecraft forming two independent interferometers.

This puts the detector in an excellent vacuum far from Earth-based sources of noise, though <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> susceptible to heat, shot noise, and artifacts caused by cosmic rays and solar wind.|$|E

500|$|The {{film has}} several {{differences}} from the novel, {{partly due to}} the different requirements of the two media. Diana Wynne Jones' novel has a very large cast of characters, and several plot threads that were too complex to be transferred into the film. As a result, characters such as Sophie's second sister Martha are left out, as is the plot thread involving Markl (who is called Michael in the novel, and depicted as an adolescent, rather than as a young boy) courting her. Jones discussed the film with Studio Ghibli representatives, but did not have any input or involvement in the production of the film. Miyazaki traveled to England in the summer of 2004 to give Jones a private viewing of the finished film. She has been quoted as saying [...] "It's fantastic. No, I have no input—I write books, not films. Yes, it will be different from the book—in fact it's likely to be very different, but that's as it should be. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> a fantastic film." ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{many other}} types of animals {{have been shown to}} have the ability for object {{permanence}}. These include dogs, cats, and a few species of birds such as the carrion crow, Eurasian jays and food-storing magpies. [...] Dogs are able to reach a level of object permanence that allows them to find food after it has been hidden beneath one of two cups and rotated 90°. [...] Similarly, cats are able to understand object permanence but not to the same extent that dogs can. Cats fail to understand that if they see something go into an apparatus in one direction that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> there if the cat tries to enter from another direction. However, while cats {{did not seem to be}} quite as good at this ‘invisible displacement test’ as dogs are, it’s hard to say whether their poorer performance is a true reflection of their abilities or just due to the way in which they’ve been tested. A longitudinal study found that carrion crows' ability developed gradually, albeit with slight changes in the order of mastery compared to human infants. There was only one task, task 15, that the crows were not able to master. The crows showed perseverative searches at a previously rewarded location (the so-called ‘A-not-B error’). They mastered visible rotational displacements consistently, but failed at more complex invisible rotational displacements. [...] Another study tested the comparison of how long it took food-storing magpies to develop the object permanence necessary for them to be able to live independently. [...] The research suggests that these magpies followed a very similar pattern as human infants while they were developing.|$|E

[...] An unwanted left yaw {{can be dealt with}} by storing some [...] "up" [...] angular momentum, which is easily done by tilting both rotor spin axes slightly up by equal amounts. [...] Since their fore and aft components will still be equal and opposite, there is no change in fore-and-aft angular momentum (<b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> zero) and therefore no unwanted roll. [...] In fact the situation will be improved, because the rotor axes are no longer quite anti-parallel and some roll control will be restored.|$|E
