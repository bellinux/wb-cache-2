40|$|<b>Variable</b> <b>attenuators</b> are {{important}} circuits {{that can be}} employed in many radio frequency (RF) applications, e. g., in automatic gain control (AGC) amplifiers, broadband gain-control blocks at RF frequencies or as broadband vector modulators. For any applications, low insertion phase shift and low power consumption are of interest. A way to implement <b>variable</b> <b>attenuators</b> is using the RF PIN diode. The PIN diode {{is characterized by a}} low doped (I = intrinsic) semiconductor region between p- (P) and n-type (N) semiconductor regions. Besides the <b>variable</b> <b>attenuators,</b> the PIN-diode is used in other RF circuits, such as RF switches, limiters and phase shifters. This project presents the design of <b>variable</b> <b>attenuators</b> at 7. 5 GHz and 500 MHz frequency bandwidth for ultra-wideband (UWB) applications using two different PIN diodes. The <b>variable</b> <b>attenuators</b> have a topology based on 90 ° hybrid couplers. The design is performed using Advance Design Systems (ADS) from Agilent Technologies Inc. After presenting the PIN diode and its equivalent circuit, the theory of the 90 ° passive directional branch line coupler and the operation principle of the <b>variable</b> <b>attenuators</b> are presented. As the selection of the appropriate PIN diode is a critical step in the design, special attention is dedicated to this aspect. It follows the design of the <b>variable</b> <b>attenuators</b> with extensive descriptions of the simulations in ADS. Firstly, both series and shunt attenuators are presented. However, as these circuits normally offer narrow band variable attenuation, the 900 directional branch line coupler is used in the attenuator for broader band operation. At the end, a double hybrid coupler is found to eliminate the ripple in the high attenuation state of the single hybrid coupled attenuator. So the final topology of the <b>variable</b> <b>attenuator</b> is a double hybrid coupler variable attenuator- Moreover, in this project, different PIN diodes are investigated for <b>variable</b> <b>attenuator</b> applications. Different manufacture companies are currently providing different kinds of PIN diodes in terms of parameters and packages. Every type of PIN diodes are providing different sort of advantages to the designers. That is why it has become more difficult for the RF designers to choose the right device for the specified application. Beside the design of the <b>variable</b> <b>attenuator</b> using PIN diodes, some considerations in form of a guide line to the designers while they are using the PIN diode for designing the <b>variable</b> <b>attenuator.</b> In this work, the used PIN diodes are a beam lead PIN diode and chip PIN diode. The beam lead PIN diode is used because it is manufactured for high frequency and it produces excellent electrical performance and isolation at high frequencies. On the other hand, the chip PIN diode eliminates the problem of package parasitics. However, printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturing limitations at the university laboratory incline the balance in the favor of the beam lead PIN diode, HPND- 4005 from Avagotech, instead of the also considered chip diode MA-COM MA 4 P 202...|$|R

We have recognized acceptability, low power consumption, and cost as the key design factors for developing widely deployable location sensing systems. As a good candidate technology that could satisfy these needs, we proposed a location sensing system based on the widely available Bluetooth medium. Location evaluation is preformed by sensing Bluetooth signal strength with a reference model based approach. We discuss problems which arise when the Bluetooth RSSI (received signal strength indicator) {{is used as a}} signal strength indicator, and propose a novel access point that supports <b>variable</b> <b>attenuators</b> to overcome these problems.
