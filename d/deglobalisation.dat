50|$|Deglobalization or <b>Deglobalisation</b> is {{the process}} of {{diminishing}} interdependence and integration between certain units around the world, typically nation-states. It is widely used to describe the periods of history when economic trade and investment between countries decline. It stands in contrast to globalization, in which units become increasingly integrated over time, and generally spans the time between periods of globalization.|$|E
40|$|This study {{covers a}} variety of {{political}} and economic aspects of Africa's and South Africa's relationships to the world. The author considers the context of global apartheid, in terms of international stagnation, uneven development and African marginalisation, and evaluates the South African setting as a telling site of worsening inequality. Where does then the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) stand on the largest economic and political problems? South Africa's other proposed global reforms are also discussed. Finally, the author records an emerging ideology based not on commodification via globalisation but on decommodification and <b>deglobalisation,</b> and the strategies, tactics and alliances required for African and international progress.

40|$|The {{essays in}} this volume discuss the {{worldwide}} economic integration between 1850 and 1930, challenging the popular description of the period after 1918 as one of mere <b>deglobalisation.</b> The authors posit that markets were not only places of material exchange, but also socially structured entities, shaped by the agency of individual actors and by complex structures {{of political and economic}} power. Economic transactions were supported by an array of different institutions, ranging from formalized regulations to informal relations of personal trust. They argue that these networks were strong enough to prosper even through and after World War I, in a political climate often hostile to foreign trade. The Foundations of Worldwide Economic Integration shows that institutionalism altered its shape in the face of circumstances that increasingly challenged international trade. By presenting case studies from various countries, this book offers a fresh perspective on crucial periods of economic globalisation...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from CUP via the DOI in this record. This article seeks to gain {{a clearer understanding of}} the language, reach, and limits of competing patriotic trade campaigns in the British Empire during the 1930 s, focusing on efforts to promote the purchase of Indian, Chinese and ‘British’ products (a term which was used to refer to goods from both the UK and Dominions). Civil society groups used patriotic buying campaigns to promote and maintain forms of regionalised integration in response to the partial <b>deglobalisation</b> of trade. Supporters of such campaigns sought to develop trade networks based on ethnic ties which could connect across and, in the Chinese case beyond, imperial spaces. However, the hybridity of colonial subjects’ identities impeded each of these efforts to develop patriotic trade networks and meant that the content, character, and popular appeal of trade campaigns shifted between different regions...|$|E
40|$|The {{international}} {{labour market}} {{has not been}} ?globalised? {{to the same degree}} over the last 40 years as have international markets for goods and capital. Immigration policies in developed economies clearly hinder the mobility of labour. But how much difference does it actually make? This paper compares emigration from Britain to four principal destinations in the era of free migration before 1914 with emigration to the same places since the 1960 s. As the doors were kept open to British emigrants for longer than most, the ?<b>deglobalisation?</b> of British labour only dates from the 1960 s. Since that time there has been a secular fall in British emigration, and this has been a major component in the transformation of the UK from a country of net emigration to one of net immigration. Before 1914 the economic and demographic forces that drove British emigration can be clearly identified. The same effects, applied to the later period, suggest that mass emigration from Britain should have continued until the early 1990 s. But from the mid 1960 s these influences became less powerful as they were increasingly inhibited by immigration policies in the principal destination countries. The decline in emigration is largely accounted for by shifts in policy, especially those that curtailed or abolished the preferences previously extended to settlers from the UK...|$|E
40|$|The {{regulatory}} {{overhaul of}} the global OTC derivatives markets, originating from the G 20, is transforming {{what used to be}} a relatively harmonised private and transnational legal regime into a public regulatory space fragmented by diverse territorial jurisdictions. In this regulatory space jurisdictional borders are elusive. Especially the United States and the European Union are applying what seems to be a novel type of regulatory strategy designed to protect their market share and curb regulatory arbitrage. The strategy, dubbed here the Regulate Thy Neighbour strategy, builds on unilateralist application of extraterritoriality, forms of direct and indirect protectionism, and conditional deference. Deference strategies such as the US substituted compliance and the EU equivalence regime should be regarded as carrots, applied together with the sticks of extraterritoriality and protectionism to drive regulatory convergence towards the strongest. However, the EU and US have failed to fill the leadership void in the global financial governance system, which remains soft at its core, and instead locked themselves in a regulatory turf war which has prevented them from recognising each other’s regulatory frameworks or finalising their own. Meanwhile, looming risks of costly regulatory retaliation are increasing market fragmentation and <b>deglobalisation.</b> The emerging "titanic model" of systemic risk management, where risk is concentrated in presumably watertight national compartments rather than mutualised globally, is not the way towards a more stable global financial system. In the short term, a successful completion of the transatlantic partnership is needed in order to reach the derivative reform's ultimate goals and to counter financial fragmentation. But acknowledging the many practical and political problems involved in the exportation of rules through the Regulate Thy Neighbour strategy, which can also be manifested in a bilateral form, this paper joins the increasing number of scholars calling for more global and multilateral forms of financial governance...|$|E
40|$|The use of geomorphology-based {{transfer}} functions is {{a strong}} perspective of low-calibrated and structurally explicit rainfall-runoff. In this study, the whole basin rainfall-runoff process is considered as the coupling of hillslope and stream network processes. The coupling variable -net rainfall- along the hillslope-river interface cannot be monitored in situ. A robust geomorphology-based transfer function through the river network is proposed, {{as well as a}} methodology for its inversion. Discharge at the catchment outlet is deconvoluted thanks to the geomorphology-based transfer function inversion, which allows to assess average net rainfall. The application of this net rainfall assessment method for two distinct periods, before and after a major hillslope change, for a given catchment allows to deglobalise the hydrological impact from the catchment outlet towards the hillslope foot. In semi-arid regions, erosion is a major problem. Contour ridges are a widely and intensely developed water and soil conservation system at the hillslope scale. The Central Tunisian semi-arid catchment of El Gouazine (18. 1 km²) was intensely and widely changed by the sudden implementation of contour ridges during summers 1997 and 1998. Hydrological impacts have been assessed at the catchment outlet in terms of global runoff coefficient, total volumes and maximum discharge. The application of the deconvolution and <b>deglobalisation</b> geomorphology-based approach to pre- 1997 and post- 1998 runoff events, induced by similar rainfall events, show various significant changes in the hillslope-scale rainfall-net rainfall process which were not appearing in the basin-level rainfall-runoff process. The major changes are the emergence of a time delay (230 min) and of a generation threshold (16 mm) of runoff. This deglobalising approach proves to be a promising impact assessment method from downstream, as an alternative to upscaling and aggregating hillslope approaches, in a catchment where a major hillslope sudden change occurred. It is based on a robust and generic geomorphologybased transfer, which is assumed to be stationary through time since changes occurred on hillslope and not in streams. Quantitative perspectives are open to consider other types of sudden changes (e. g. wildfire), as well as progressive changes (e. g. ageing of landscape artefacts, including of contour ridges themselves). Furthermore, such an assessment of the hillslope-river network coupling variable will allow to develop a library of production functions to be coupled with the geomorphology-based transfer function, according to hillslope types...|$|E
