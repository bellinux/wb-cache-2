Examples range from CBeebies, through school and high-school revision guides and virtual universities, to access to top-end scholarly literature through the likes of Google Scholar. For distance education, help with homework and other assignments, self-guided learning, whiling away spare time, or just looking up more detail on an interesting fact, {{it has never been}} easier for people to access educational information at any level from anywhere. The Internet in general and the World Wide Web in particular are important <b>enablers</b> of both formal and informal education. Further, the Internet allows universities, in particular, researchers from the social and behavioral sciences, to conduct research remotely via virtual laboratories, with profound changes in reach and generalizability of findings as well as in communication between scientists and in the publication of results.|$|E

This proposal would place both football clubs on a rapid-transit Merseyrail line circling the city giving high throughput, fast transport access. This would entail Liverpool FC abandoning the relocation plans from their Anfield ground to the planned nearby Stanley Park Stadium.|$|E

2500|$|Raskin has {{subjected}} his radicalism of the 1960s and 1970s to a searching {{and thoughtful}} analysis, {{and he now}} views his affiliation with the Weather Underground and his endorsement of its politics as largely self-dramatization that wasted the energy and resources of the above-ground <b>enablers</b> {{as well as the}} underground fugitives. [...] A final moment of political disillusionment with the radical left and dreams of Third World socialism came with a visit to Hanoi in 1995, where he experienced Vietnam as a country run by a Communist elite rapidly enriching themselves from a freewheeling capitalist economy.|$|E
2500|$|Literary {{historian}} Leon Volovici {{also sees}} Eminescu as guided by an economic theory, but notes {{his vision of}} an [...] "objective conflict" [...] between Romanians and foreigners, including in particular Jews (assimilated or not) and Greeks; the [...] "apocalyptic" [...] Doina formed part of that discourse. Romania's Jews, Eminescu insisted, were most removed from the authentically Romanian peasantry, and therefore [...] "could not merge with our people." [...] Draft versions of the poem make explicit mention of [...] "Stephen's Romanians" [...] being [...] "in kike hands", and record with alarm the spread of Yiddish in Bukovina. Another manuscript proclaims specific curses against the perceived <b>enablers</b> of Jews, Greeks, and Russians; for instance: ...|$|E
2500|$|Moreover, Emanuele Ottolenghi {{said that}} Jews, such as Prof. Israel Shahak argues act as <b>enablers</b> for anti-Semites, because {{the rhetoric of}} anti-semitic Jews plays a [...] "crucial role... in excusing, condoning, and — in effect — abetting anti-Semitism." [...] In his opinion, [...] "Anti-Semites rely on Jews to confirm their prejudice: If Jews recur to such language, and {{advocate}} such policies, how can anyone be accused of anti-Semitism, for making the same arguments?... The mechanism through which an anti-Semitic accusation becomes respectable once a Jew endorses it {{is not limited to}} Israel's new historians.... Israel Shahak made the comparison between Israel and Nazism respectable — all the while describing Judaism according to the medieval canons of the blood libel".|$|E
2500|$|Get a Life, {{written in}} 2005 {{after the death}} of her long-time spouse, Reinhold Cassirer, {{is the story of a}} man {{undergoing}} treatment for a life-threatening disease. While clearly drawn from personal life experiences, the novel also continues Gordimer's exploration of political themes. The protagonist is an ecologist, battling installation of a planned nuclear plant. But he is at the same time undergoing radiation therapy for his cancer, causing him personal grief and, ironically, rendering him a nuclear health hazard in his own home. Here, Gordimer again pursues the questions of how to integrate everyday life and political activism. New York Times critic J. R. Ramakrishnan, who noted a similarity with author Mia Alvar, wrote that Gordimer wrote about [...] "long-suffering spouses and (the) familial <b>enablers</b> of political men" [...] in her fiction.|$|E
2500|$|The Liverpool City Council Regeneration and Transport Select Committee {{meeting on}} 10 February 2011 {{featured}} {{a proposal to}} open the Bootle Branch line using [...] "Liverpool Football Club and Everton Football Club as priorities, as economic <b>enablers</b> of the project". This proposal would place both football clubs on a rapid transit Merseyrail line that would circle the city and ease transport access. In September 2014 the club, working with the Liverpool City Council and Liverpool Mutual Homes, outlined initial {{plans to build a}} new stadium in Walton Hall Park. However, those plans were later scrapped in May 2016 with the prospect of two new sites being identified for the club. At the Annual General Meeting in January 2017, the chairman, Bill Kenwright revealed that Bramley-Moore Dock was the preferred site for the new stadium, with a new railway station and a new road being funded by the City Council.|$|E
2500|$|The Army placed {{importance}} on the GCV's {{ability to carry}} a full nine-man squad. [...] Numerous Army studies have concluded that a squad, containing two fireteams, should be composed of nine to eleven soldiers. [...] These numbers allow the squad to accomplish the fire and maneuver doctrine, and for squad resilience, lethality, and leader span of control. [...] The M2 Bradley cannot carry a complete squad from one vehicle, creating risk when transitioning from mounted to dismounted operations. [...] The Bradley's lower carrying capacity was accepted for greater (than previous vehicles) mounted lethality and cost savings, leading to squads being broken apart for transport. [...] A GCV with a nine-man squad would have allowed the squad leader to control and communicate with the squad while mounted, simplify the transition to dismounted operations in complex terrain, and allow the squad to conduct independent fire and maneuver immediately upon dismount. [...] Replacing the Bradley on a one-for-one basis would have four GCVs per mechanized infantry platoon carrying one full nine-man squad in a single vehicle, with three vehicles carrying squads and one carrying the platoon's organic and attached <b>enablers.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Chrétien's {{government}} {{did not support the}} US-led 2003 invasion of Iraq. His reasoning was that the war lacked UN Security Council sanction; while {{not a member of the}} Security Council, Canada nevertheless attempted to build a consensus for a resolution authorizing the use of force after a short (two to three-month) extension to UN weapon inspections in Iraq. (Critics also noted that, while in opposition, he had also opposed the first US-led Gulf War, which had been approved by the UN Security Council and in 1999 supported NATO air strikes against Serbia, which had no Security Council approval.) In order to avoid damaging relations with the United States, Chrétien agreed to another and larger deployment of Canadian troops to Afghanistan on February 12, 2003, in order to prove that Canada was still a good American ally, despite opposing the upcoming Iraq war. The Army's commander General, Mike Jeffery, was against the deployment of 2,000 troops to Afghanistan, arguing that [...] "We did not have strategic lift, we lacked certain strategic <b>enablers,</b> certain types of intelligence, certain types of communications. Our logistics capability was weak", and that at most Canada had the capacity to support only 500 troops in Afghanistan. General Jeffery's views were ignored, and Canada sent 2,000 soldiers to Afghanistan in the summer of 2003. In December 2003, it emerged that the Department of National Defence had prepared plans for Canada to send as many as 800 Canadian troops to Iraq if the UN Security Council had authorized it; however, a UN request for an increased deployment of Canadian soldiers to Afghanistan removed this option from the table. This led some of Chrétien's anti-war critics on the left to accuse the Prime Minister of never really being fully opposed to the war. Nonetheless, Canada was the first non-member of the US-led coalition to provide significant financial aid to the post-war reconstruction effort, relative to Canada's size. This move allowed Canadian companies to bid on reconstruction contracts.|$|E
