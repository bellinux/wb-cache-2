25|$|DRDO {{has been}} {{responsible}} for the <b>indigenisation</b> of key defence stores and equipment. DRDO has assisted Hindustan Aeronautics Limited and the IAF with the <b>indigenisation</b> of spares and assemblies for several aircraft. DRDO laboratories have worked in coordination with academic institutes, the CSIR and even ISRO over projects required for the Indian Air Force and its sister services. DRDO's infrastructure is also utilised by other research organisations in India. In the first ever initiative of its kind, DRDO has provided its patented Copper-Titanium (CuTi) alloy technology for commercial exploitation to a start-up company. The agreement between DRDO and Pahwa Metal Tech Pvt Ltd was signed on the sidelines of the Start Up India event at Delhi.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} {{aforementioned}} upgrades, DRDO has also assisted Hindustan Aeronautics with its programmes. These include the HAL Dhruv helicopter and the HAL HJT-36. Over a hundred LRU (Line Replaceable Unit)'s in the HJT-36 have come {{directly from the}} LCA programme. Other duties have included assisting the Indian Air Force with <b>indigenisation</b> of spares and equipment. These include both mandatory {{as well as other}} items.|$|E
25|$|These have {{included}} <b>indigenisation</b> of various components (for instance, adsorbent material for submarines, radar components, naval ship signature reduction efforts and materials technology). DRDO {{has played a}} significant role in the development of warship grade steel in India and its productionisation. DRDO has also assisted private industry in developing EW trainers, ship simulators for training and health monitoring systems for onboard equipment. Other equipment for the Navy includes underwater telephone sets, and VLF communication equipment, for the Navy's submarines. DRDO's IRDE has also developed optronic fire control systems for the Navy's and the Coast Guard's ships.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet {{policy of}} korenizatsiya (<b>indigenisation)</b> {{resulted}} {{in the creation of}} 105 Korean village soviets (councils) in mixed-nationality raion, as well as an entire raion for the Korean nationality, the Pos'et Korean National Raion; these conducted their activities entirely in the Korean language. The Soviet Koreans had a large number of their own official institutions, including 380 Korean schools, two teachers' colleges, one pedagogical school, three hospitals, a theatre, six journals, and seven newspapers (the largest of which, Vanguard, had a circulation of 10,000). The 1937 Census showed 168,259 Koreans in the Soviet Union. However, officials in the Russian Far East viewed the Koreans' ethnic and family ties to the Japanese Empire with suspicion, which would soon {{set the stage for the}} deportation of the whole population.|$|E
25|$|The Russian Civil War {{devastated the}} whole Russian Empire {{including}} Ukraine. It left over 1.5 million people dead {{and hundreds of}} thousands homeless in the former Russian Empire territory. Soviet Ukraine also faced the Russian famine of 1921 (primarily affecting the Russian Volga-Ural region). During the 1920s, under the Ukrainisation policy pursued by the national Communist leadership of Mykola Skrypnyk, Soviet leadership encouraged a national renaissance in the Ukrainian culture and language. Ukrainisation was part of the Soviet-wide policy of Korenisation (literally <b>indigenisation).</b> The Bolsheviks were also committed to universal health care, education and social-security benefits, as well as the right to work and housing. Women's rights were greatly increased through new laws. Most of these policies were sharply reversed by the early 1930s after Joseph Stalin became the de facto communist party leader.|$|E
25|$|The {{office of}} the Elected President of Singapore {{represents}} an <b>indigenisation</b> of the Westminster system of government and is cast as a check against the powers enjoyed by the parliamentary executive, adding to the overall scheme {{of checks and balances}} in the doctrine of separation of powers. Nonetheless, the institution has a limited range of functions and is essentially reactive in nature, such that it cannot be seen to be an alternative locus of political power. The President has power to block attempts by the Government to draw down past reserves it did not accumulate, to approve changes to key appointments, and to exercise oversight over the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau and decisions of the executive under the ISA and the MRHA. The aim is not to enable the President to target unlawful executive actions, but lawful actions against national interests.|$|E
500|$|Terang Boelan premiered on 8December 1937 at the Rex Theatre in Batavia, {{the capital}} of the Dutch East Indies; it played to a nearly full theatre. Also marketed under the Dutch title Het Eilan der Droomen, the film was advertised as showing that the Indies were as {{beautiful}} as Hawaii, a popular island paradise in Hollywood films. Posters also emphasised the use of Indonesian-language dialogue. William van der Heide, a lecturer on film studies at the University of Newcastle in Australia, notes that the film continued a trend of [...] "Indonesianisation", or the application of a national (Indonesian) understanding to borrowed concepts; for Terang Boelan this <b>indigenisation</b> process involved the inclusion of [...] "exotic local settings" [...] and keroncong music. Such adaptations of foreign films had arisen several years earlier and continued long after Terang Boelan release.|$|E
500|$|After the Russian civil war, Joseph Stalin was {{disappointed}} at the Soviet Union's inability to foment a successful revolution in Finland, [...] and furthermore, the Bolsheviks struggle with national sentiments inside the Soviet Union. In 1923, Stalin proclaimed {{that the main}} danger in national relations was Great-Russian chauvinism. He started the policy of Korenizatsiya, <b>indigenisation,</b> to promote national communist cadres for every nationality. However, from 1937 Stalin encouraged Russian chauvinism, implying the Russians were politically and culturally superior. The Soviet diplomacy turned towards {{the recovery of the}} territories of the Tsarist state. The Soviet Union used the Comintern to announce a doctrine where bourgeoisie equaled Fascism, and that Communism was the natural agency of the proletariat. In practice, this meant that anything other than Communism would be considered anti-Soviet and fascist. The Soviet foreign policy was a mixture of the ideology of world revolution and the traditional concerns of Russian national security.|$|E

5000|$|Following ZANU-PF's {{landslide}} electoral {{victory in}} the 2013 general elections, Patrick Chinamasa was appointed finance minister. Policies encouraging the <b>indigenisation</b> of the economy were fast tracked and laws requiring that 51% or more of non-black Zimbabwean owned companies had {{to be handed over}} to black Zimbabweans were implemented. This has been credited with creating further uncertainty in the economy and negatively impacting investment climate in the country. Although legislation dealing with the <b>indigenisation</b> of the Zimbabwean economy has been in development since 2007 and actively initiated by ZANU-PF in 2010 the policy has continued to be accused of being unclear and a form of [...] "racketeering by regulation."
