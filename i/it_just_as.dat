The Doctor warns that Rory's fate is now sealed—he will die in that room, without having seen Amy {{for a very long}} time beforehand. He deduces that the Angels have been using the Quay as a battery farm, sending the victims to their past while feeding off their time energy. Rory and Amy refuse to accept their fate, and as the Angels converge, they flee to the roof, where the Statue of Liberty, revealed to be a Weeping Angel, waits for them. Rory surmises that if he kills himself by jumping off the roof, he'll create a paradox that will destroy the building and the Angels, resetting the future. Refusing to allow him to die alone, Amy joins him and the two jump off the roof.|$|E

25|$|The Mishnah {{taught that}} any {{pool of water}} that mingles with the water of a mikveh is as valid as the mikveh itself.

25|$|Glossopoeia was Tolkien's hobby {{for most}} of his life. At a little over 13, he helped {{construct}} a sound substitution cypher known as Nevbosh, 'new nonsense', which grew to include some elements of actual invented language. Notably, Tolkien claimed that this was not his first effort in invented languages. Shortly thereafter, he developed a true invented language called Naffarin which contained elements that would survive into his later languages, which he continued to work on until his death more than 65 years later. Language invention had always been tightly connected to the mythology that Tolkien developed, as he found that a language could not be complete without the history of the people who spoke <b>it,</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> these people could never be fully realistic if imagined only through English and as speaking English. Tolkien therefore took the stance of a translator and adaptor rather than that of the original author of his works.|$|E
25|$|Hearing her screams {{from behind}} the door, Teresa (Jenna Dewan Tatum) is spotted by Bloody Face who kicks {{open the door and}} attacks her. Grabbing her, Bloody Face then throws Teresa against a wall, {{knocking}} her unconscious. Bloody Face prepares to kill Teresa when Leo (Adam Levine), in an attempt to save her life, throws himself into Bloody Face's way, knocking both of them onto the floor and Bloody Face unconscious. While Teresa regains consciousness, Leo kicks the murder weapon away from Bloody Face towards Teresa. Grabbing the weapon, Teresa violently stabs Bloody Face. They attempt to run down the hall to escape and another Bloody Face on the other end stops them. In disbelief, they turn around to see a third Bloody Face, who fatally shoots them. The two Bloody Faces removed their masks and discuss the recent events, with one appearing nervous of their crime. One of them notices Leo's arm and questions <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> another Bloody Face approaches them.|$|E
25|$|For generations, Xianghua's {{ancestors}} of the Chai family have groomed men and women into seasoned warriors of China. A woman named Xiangfei {{was sent to the}} prestigious Ling-Sheng Su Temple to learn the swordplay and became supremely skilled with the jian. Following her father's passing, Xiangfei forged a forbidden romance with Kong Xiuqiang, a monk at the temple and the most prominent candidate for inheritor of the holy bo staff, the Kali-Yuga. Not until the illegitimate birth of their first daughter, Xianglian, was their love made known to the other monks who remained very strict regarding the temple's edicts and so Xianglian was taken from her parents on her second birthday. Xiangfei became too wrought with grief to remain at the temple. Han Dongxiu, a sworn brother of Xiuqiang and Xiangfei, helped Xiuqiang sneak the holy Krita-Yuga sword to his lover, to serve as a promise the two would one day meet again. Unknown to Xiuqiang was that when Xiangfei, pregnant with a second child, had left the temple, secretly returned to her homeland, was taken in by the Chai home there, and {{became a member of the}} Ming Dynasty secret Imperial Guard, the Jinyiwei. Months later, she gave birth to her second daughter, Xianghua, but never revealed anything about the girl's father or his lineage to her. By this time, the temple had found that Xiuqiang had stolen the Krita-Yuga and he was exiled from the temple, but Xianglian was to remain there to be trained as an orphan. Xiuqiang eventually discovered Xiangfei's whereabouts, but the Chai family asked him to leave her alone, as she would be happier in her ignorance. When monks from the Temple came to Xiangfei, searching for the missing sword, all they found was young Xianghua playing with a battered jian, and they gave up the search years later. Only Xiuqiang knew that Xianghua's sword was actually the Krita-Yuga in disguise. As time passed, Xianghua had learned to use <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> well as her mother when Xiangfei died after her 11th birthday. Five years afterward, Xianghua became a member of the Imperial Guard.|$|E
